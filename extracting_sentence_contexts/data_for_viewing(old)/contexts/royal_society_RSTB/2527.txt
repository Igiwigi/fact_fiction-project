Polypodium aureum. He describes the young central cylinder of P. aurewmn as being
composed ofa ring of wood surrounded by phloem and containing an intrastelar pith.
Later on the stelar tube becomes enlarged, and phloem appears on its internal
surface. The pith has now disappeared, and the centre of the stelar tube is
occupied by extrastelar fundamental tissue which: becomes continuous with the
cortex through the foliar gaps. I have looked in vain in my preparations for the
pith of Lecrerc pu Santon, Although my series were numerous I have never
seen anything corresponding to the large-celled intrastelar parenchyma figured by
Lecrerc pu SABLON as occupying the centre of the young cauline stele. I have
secured young plants of this species from three different sources, and in each lot
found the same results. Iam disposed to believe that the specimens examined by
Lecierc pu SaBron could not have been quite normal. This belief is strengthened
by the fact that young plants of P. vulgare gave similar negative results. In my
specimens of P. awreum and P. vulgare, when the tube of xylem is first established,
it has phloem on its internal surface as well as on the outside. A core of funda-
mental tissue is likewise enclosed almost immediately. Photograph 34, Plate 5,
is of a section through the young stem of P. aureum.

It is a pecularity of Polypodium that even at a comparatively early stage in the
development of the young plant the leaf-trace is double, and one-half of the trace
becomes separated from the cauline central cylinder sooner than the other, as may be
seen in the photograph, where the projection from the stem is a leaf-base containing
two traces which are just beginning to separate from each other. The case of
P. aureum is cited by Zenertt in favour of his hypothesis that the so-called medul-
lated monostelie central cylinder is the primitive type of tubular stele. It seems
