There remains to be considered experiment no. 3, figure 4, which was an exception to
the relationship shown by the graph, figure 10, in that the arc of the anodic half of J was
considerably smaller in relation to the angle J,|-/, than in any other experiment of group I. This arc was indeed only 170°, which is only 3°-5 greater than the normal arc, whereas the
angle [,—J, was over 180°. Now in this experiment, though the angle /,—/, is large, J, is only
slightly displaced towards P,, as was pointed out on p. 148, where both these facts were inter-
preted as resulting from an incomplete removal of the centre of P,. The same explanation may
account for the slightness of the change in the asymmetry of J,. For if the centre of P, was
still growing when the flanks of J, were extending round the apex a relatively long kathodic
and short anodic flank would be expected in J, as in a normal leaf.
