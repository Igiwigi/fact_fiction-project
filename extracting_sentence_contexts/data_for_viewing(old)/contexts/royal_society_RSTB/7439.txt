growths in the mucous lining of the nasal tubes, representing the maxillo-turbinal folds, but
these contain no cartilaginous supports.

Meckel’s cartilages (Mc) are slender twisted rods. Each lies along the mesial face of the
dentary bone, the ventro-lateral border of which is cup-shaped to receive it. The anterior
portion is curved downwards where the dentary narrows. Here it is enclosed by the bone
and becomes partially ossified (?medio-Meckelian), then breaks through the anterior end of
the dentary, projecting beyond it and forming the major part of the symphysis. The two
cartilages diverge slightly anterior to the symphysis, and each ends freely. Posteriorly
Meckel’s cartilage is linked with the auditory region (see below).

As is well known, the auditory capsule in the Cetacea is readily separable from the rest
of the skull in the adult, owing to the fact that the fused petrosal and tympanic are attached
to the other bones by membrane only. In the foetus, however, before ossification in any
part of the capsule has occurred, the cartilaginous capsule is linked with other parts of the
chondrocranium at the following points:

(1) Antero-laterally by the orbito-capsular commissure (occ) joining the orbital cartilage
with the lateral wall of the auditory capsule.

(2) Laterally and on the dorsal or cranial side by the prefacial (supra-facial) commissure,
linking the side wall of the skull with the auditory capsule, anterior to the entrance of the
facial nerve into the aqueductus Falloppii, and continuous laterally with the orbito-capsular
commissure. This is shown, but not lettered, in figure 3.
