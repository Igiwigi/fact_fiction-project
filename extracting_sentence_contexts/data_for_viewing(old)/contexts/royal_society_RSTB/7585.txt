The reproductive rate of the G, animals was, as far as is known, entirely satisfactory. The
G, animals gave rise to many young in August 1937, but failed to breed in the spring of
1938, and the G, generation did not breed at all. These observations are indicated in
column } above. Now in order to account for this decrease in viability and reproductive
performance it is necessary to postulate a delayed effect of some previous condition. It
must be supposed, in fact, that the strife in the early part of the season, which was fatal

for the young, had certain permanent effects upon the constitution of the Gy animals. We
cannot at present be more precise about this supposed condition than to imagine some
disturbance of the hormone balance of the mother which in some manner affected the
foetus (less probably the nestling). The inference that almost the entire population of
adult females was physiologically affected through some intraspecific process thus differs
from the observations of Calhoun (1949) on captive brown rats (Rattus norvegicus). Calhoun
found that ‘socially inhibited’ brown rats were unsuccessful in rearing their young, but
he records no ill effects among the dominants or their progeny. However, in a natural
