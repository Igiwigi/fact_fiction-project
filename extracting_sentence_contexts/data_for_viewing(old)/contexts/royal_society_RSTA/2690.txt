The first question that we address is how long it will take to unambiguously identify a patch of
weaker or stronger material, embedded in a larger system, by analysing the statistics of avalanche
events. We consider a lattice of 200 x 200 elements, containing a block of size d = 20 on which
s =s,, and where s = s2 elsewhere. The strength of the local inhomogeneity is thus As = sz — s1,
such that As < 0 represents a strong patch, and vice versa. For simplicity, and to avoid introducing
multiple independent length scales into the analysis, we also mask the resulting activity with a
window of size ¢ = 20. The whole system is then divided up into 100 different grid cells, each
containing 20 x 20 elements, and the scaling coefficient B is calculated for the activity on each
different grid cell, by a least-squares fit to the rank size distribution. Similar results are also found
if the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) method [31] is used.

The limitations in the resolution (both spatial and temporal) come from the facts that (i) the
locations of individual avalanches are imprecisely known, as the exact locations are convolved
with a mask of size ¢, and (ii) the system is divided into several (in this case 100) observation
boxes. It is important to note that the observation of a ‘subsample’ within the whole sample is not
