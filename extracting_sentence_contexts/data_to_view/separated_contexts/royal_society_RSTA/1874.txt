One key piece of evidence in favour of accommodation is the Royal Society’s :R
citation for the Davy Medal, awarded in 1882, after the fulfilment of Mendeleev’s predicted : o
discoveries of gallium and scandium. The citation detailed how Mendeleev’s and co-recipient ad
Lothar Meyer’s tables so successfully integrated the chemical and physical properties of the : §
elements into what was destined to become a ‘foundation of a general system of classification’ : S

Darwin’s contribution is overwhelmingly shaped by the scope of his ability to accommodate

comprised the bulk of the life sciences of his day, and united them under a single conceptual
framework. It then went further by incorporating biogeography, behaviour and palaeontology.
