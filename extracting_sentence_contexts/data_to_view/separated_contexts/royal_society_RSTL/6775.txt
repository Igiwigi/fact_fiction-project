LESLIE him-
self connects the effect with aqueous vapour by the following remark :—* The pressure
[apparently a misprint for presence] of hygrometric moisture in the air probably affects
the indications of the instrument.” In fact, the moisture opened and closed an invisible
door for the radiation of the *sentient bulb” of the instrument into space. The follow-
ing observation in reference to radiation-experiments with PoviLLet's pyrhbeliometer,
now receives its explanation. ©
