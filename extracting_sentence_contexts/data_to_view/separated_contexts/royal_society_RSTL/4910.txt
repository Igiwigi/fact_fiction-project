This marvellous little being is no longer an organic paradox. Its
fluids and solids are now intelligible ; the essential elements of its organism are unravelled. + I had repeatedly and beyond doubt established this fact (by numerous observations on several species of
Pulmograde and Cirrhigrade Medusz found in the Bay of Swansea and the Bristol Channel) long before the
advantage occurred to me of perusing the valuable paper of Mr. HuxLzy in the Philosophical Transactions © On
the Anatomy and Affinities of the Family of the Medusz,” Part II. 1849. With reference to the digestive
cavity of the Cryptocarp and Phanerocarp families Mr. HuxLzy remarks, © Whatever its appearance, it will
