When a body
MDCCXCV111. B


2 Mr. Vince's Experiments on the Resistance

moves in a fluid, its particles strike the body; and, in our theo-
retical considerations, after this action, the particles are sup-
posed to produce no further effect, but are conceived to be, as
it were, annihilated. But, in fact, this cannot be the case;
and what we are to allow for their effect afterwards, is beyond
the reach of mere theoretical investigation. Whatever theory
therefore we can admit, must be that which is founded upon
such experiments as include in them every principle which is
subject to any degree of uncertainty, We must therefore have
recourse to experiments, in order to establish any conclusions
upon which we may afterwards reas0n, In the paper above
mentioned, I described a machine to find the resistances of
bodies moving in fluids; since which time, I have made a va-
riety of experiments with it, upon bodies moving both in air
and water, and I have every reason to be satisfied of its great
accuracy. In this paper, I propose to examine the resistance
which arises from the action of non-elastic fluids upon bodies.
