Although it is well known that plant pathogenic bacteria react to various stimu-
lations of host plants [13,14], the biochemical mechanism by which bacterial
cells sense plant chemicals or plant-derived cues remains largely unknown. Especially, the specific receptor—ligand interaction between host and pathogen
has not been well established through studies that combine multi-discipline
approaches. In fact, knowledge about bacterial sensing will provide insights
into the molecular mechanism of disease pathogenesis, which facilitates the
rational design of novel approaches to fight these important pathogens. THE ROYAL SOCIETY
