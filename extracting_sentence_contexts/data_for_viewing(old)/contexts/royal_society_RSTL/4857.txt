may refer. I need only state at present that it demonstrates, from observations on
the flow of Stockholm pitch with a speed wholly insensible, and which requires some
months for its accomplishment even in small masses, that a motion, of the nature of
fluid motion, takes place at temperatures at which the pitch remains 80 hard as to
be fragile throughout, and presents angular fragments with a conchoidal fracture.
Mr. Gorpox adds, that the resistance of the pitch to its own forward motion produces
bands of differential velocity and having the frontal dip.

Note on the Velocity of Lava, referred to in p. 149.

The following are a few facts which I have collected on the velocity of lava. That
of Vesuvius in 1805 appears to be the most fluid on record. Von Bucn, who was in
company with MM. pz HumBorpr and Gay-Lvssac, describes it as shooting suddenly
before their eyes from top to bottom of the cone in one single instant-, which must cor-
respond to a velocity of many hundred feet in a few seconds without interpreting it lite-
rally. MeLocramr, quoted by Brz1sLax+, says it described three miles in four minutes,
or about, seventy-five feet per second at a mean. The same lava, when it reached
the level roadat Torre del Greco, moved at the rate of only eighteen inches per minute,
or three-tenths of an inch per secondyh. The lava of 1794 (Vesuvius) reached the sea,
a distance of 12,961 feet, in six hours, or passed over one-third of a mile per hour, or
eight inches per second|| ; whilst the lava of Etna, in 1651, described sixteen miles
in twenty-four hours, or above a foot per second the whole way. That of 1669 (Etna),
which destroyed Catania, described the first thirteen miles of its course in twenty
