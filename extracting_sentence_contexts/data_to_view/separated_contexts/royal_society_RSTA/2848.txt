The particular shape of this stress-separation-curve (SSC) (figure 2d) is regarded as
a material property: the energy absorbed per unit crack area advance (G;) of the traction-free
crack is represented by the area under this curve. Given that no well-defined crack tip exists, the
notional crack tip is assumed to coincide with the point ahead of the traction-free crack at which
the tensile stress normal to the crack plane is equal to the local tensile strength of. The FPZ lies
between the traction-free crack tip and the notional crack tip and this FPZ is often called a fictitious
crack. Within the fictitious crack, the cohesive stress ofp, and the opening of the crack faces w are
related by the Ofpz, — W curve (figure 2d). The response of material points lying outside of the FPZ is governed by the applicable o — «
behaviour of the bulk material.
