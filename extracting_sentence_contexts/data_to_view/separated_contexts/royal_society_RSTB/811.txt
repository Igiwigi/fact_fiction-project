If there be but little quickening the contraction
volume of the ventricles is increased. The augmentors, on direct stimulation, cause a slight increase in the diastolic
expansion of the ventricles, which is passive in nature and due to the increased force
of the auricular contraction. The force of the ventricular contractions is increased ;
they contract more completely, diminishing the amount of residual blood in spite of the
fact that the arterial pressure is usually somewhat raised. (Pp, 242-244.) There are certain nerve fibres, other than the nervi augmentores proper, which
pass from the stellate ganglion to the heart, sometimes by the annulus of
Vieussens to the inferior cervical ganglion, but sometimes as separate branches
passing directly to the heart from the “ ganglion stellatum” or the “annulus.”
