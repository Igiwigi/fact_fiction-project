the apical nerve of the asteroid, as will later be shown, is not in any way homologous
with that of the crinoid.

The question now arises as to the extent to which comparison of the sensory and

motor divisions of the nervous system of the various classes of the phylum can be
made. Little difficulty is to be found in tracing the homologies of the sensory
(ectoneural) system. The circumoral ring and radial nerves are found in all
echinoderms except the crinoids, where the nerve ring may be poorly developed or
entirely lacking, in which latter case the fibrillae of the radial cord innervate the
oesophagus directly. In the crinoids the apical system provides the functional
sensory system, the radial ectoneural cord being purely subsidiary, as witness the
fact that its removal does not in any way interfere with the normal functioning of the
animal. The apical system of the crinoid is not, therefore, directly comparable to
that of the asteroid where the nerve is entirely motor in function. The apical nerve
of the asteroid, which has been regarded by many authors as constituting one of the
fundamental divisions of the motor nervous system has, consequently, no homologue
among the rest of the Echinodermata. Furthermore, although the hyponeural
system is a more constant feature of the echinoderm nervous system, its variable
constitution in the different classes of the phylum further demonstrates the variable
nature of the motor system generally. The conclusion to be drawn is that while
the functional sensory system is comparable in all groups except the crinoids, the
motor system, both in respect to its apical and hyponeural divisions, exhibits varying
degrees of development and is not strictly comparable throughout the phylum,
It is clear, therefore, that before comparison of the motor system of the various
