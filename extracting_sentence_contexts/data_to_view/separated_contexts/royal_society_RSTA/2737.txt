Analysis.â€”Kor the analyses the alloys were dissolved in nitric acid, the solutien
neutralized with ammonia, made faintly acid with nitric acid, after which the copper
was separated electrolytically. Owing to the fact that the first deposit tended to
carry down a little germanium, the copper was redissolved and redeposited, then dried
and weighed. The combined filtrates and electrolytes were evaporated and ignited to
constant weight in a weighed silica crucible, Since the oxide, GeOg, is very hygroscopic,

the weighing must be rapid. The oxide was tested for copper, and any traces of this
metal estimated colorimetrically.
