Bercovici & Skemer [17] suggested another mechanical
mechanism for phase mixing in samples of Ol plus Opx in which small grains or ‘teeth’ of Ol
form at Opx-Ol-Opx triple junctions. In response to the imposed stress gradient, these Ol ‘teeth’
migrate away from the Ol layer along Opx-Opx grain boundaries towards Opx triple junctions,
thus causing mixing of the two phases. Tasaka et al. [18] explained phase mixing in their Ol plus
Opx samples with a chemical mechanism based on (i) the fact that Ol and Opx share common
chemical building blocks, MeO and SiQ2 and (ii) the appearance of small grains of Ol and Opx
along grain boundaries of the opposite phase. They interpreted this feature as being due to stress
gradients established during deformation driving diffusion of the faster component, MeO, from
Ol grain boundaries in deviatoric compression to Opx grain boundaries in deviatoric tension. Owing to the slow diffusion speed of the SiO2 component in this system [19-21], small grains of
Opx are left behind at Ol grain boundaries, and the MeO reacts with the neighbouring Opx to
form new, small grains of Ol at Opx grain boundaries.
