For these reasons, a probabilistic calibration
method using instrumental or satellite data should be applied to the long-term wave climate at
the nearshore position. Then, an appropriate model for solving the shallow water hydrodynamics
processes should be used. In relation to the geometrical and structural variables of the breakwater (i.e. seaward slope or
mass density of the crown-wall), an adequate statistical characterization is also needed due to
the fact that limit state equations are also influenced by the uncertainties related to the resistance
variables. Generally, complex analyses are not possible due to the lack of data and statistics of
these variables. Although it could be improved by taking samples of the structural elements of
the analysed historic breakwater, this is out of the scope of most works.
