mesenchymatous cells penetrate into the narrow space between these two organs (fig.
la, peh.m.). On the contrary, the wedge-shaped spaces between the neural cord and
notochord are devoid of sclerotomic elements, and none of the mesenchymatous cells
have grown in between these two organs, which, in fact, are in close apposition (fig. 1a,
ne., nch.).

The cleft separating two successive somites, and consequently their respective
sclerotomes, the intersomitic or intersclerotomic fissure, is very distinctly developed in
the cervical (fig. 2, ir.f.) and anterior half of the thoracic region (fig. 3, ir.f.). In the
