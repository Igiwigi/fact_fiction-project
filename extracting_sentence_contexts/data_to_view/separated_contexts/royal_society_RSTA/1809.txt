At the Mull of
Cantyre it is also 4 feet. The equality of the heights of the tide on the two sides of
the channel is probably due to the. fact that, at the times the stream is running at its
maximum speed, when therefore we should expect the maximum difference in level on
the two sides of the Channel owing to geostrophic force, the water is at its mean
level. At H.W. and L.W. the streams are slack, so that no geostrophic effect is to be
anticipated at those times. Tn the formula
