of the frontal lobe in relation to areas 6 and 8 of BRopMaNN. This sulcus may in
some cases become incorporated-with the so-called sulcus frontalis superior.

It is from the standpoint of the studies of the arterial supply, combined with a
careful survey of the works of BRopMANN, CAMPBELL, and Exuior Smrru, that the
description of the sulci of the frontal lobe is here given. Before knowledge of the
histological structure was acquired by these writers, CUNNINGHAM had written his
masterly account of the frontal lobes. Despite the fact that he had not this infor-
mation to aid him, his memoir must still act as the foundation for any description
of the frontal lobes. His account of the individual sulci and their relationships still
stands as a monument of accuracy, but certain of his views concerning homology
must be modified. Throughout this account CuNNINGHAM’s arrangement will be
very closely followed, so that direct comparison may be made between the brain of
the Australian and the brain of the European.

Before proceeding to the description of the hemispheres themselves, it is desirable
to give a brief account of the sequence of changes in the evolution and development
of the sulci of the frontal lobe, as they appear to the writer, to serve as an intro-
duction to the Australian brain.
