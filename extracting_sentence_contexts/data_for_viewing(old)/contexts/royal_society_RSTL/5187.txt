and, substituting in this the values above found, viz.
b=208:967, V/=197-649,
e=— *589, e=— -099,
we find B=195:363.

In order, by means of this result, to determine the correction to be applied as a
multiplier to the number of degrees above or below B, it remains to determine the
amount of error due to each degree, which, in fact, when its sign is changed, will be
the required factor; calling this correction C, we have

It may be remarked, that the principle on which the determination of this correc-
tion is founded remains unaffected by the supposition that the errors from which it
is derived are partly attributable to the diameter of the bore of the thermometer in-
creasing uniformly in descending ; this I have satisfied myself by the usnal means
to be the case, though to a comparatively trifling amount,

The observations recorded at the Geneva Observatory and those at the Great St,
Bernard afford an excellent means of applying my own to the determination of
the height of my several stations, since those places present the advantage of being,
the one my starting-point, and the other a position central to my series of stations.
