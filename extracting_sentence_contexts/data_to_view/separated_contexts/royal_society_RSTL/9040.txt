Others of these lines'I conceive to pursue
yarious courses, and in 80 doing to connect the radial lines with one another. All the
lines of such a plexus I conceive to be capable, in a high degree, of vicarious action ;
and I am inclined to suppose that a large proportional number of such lines are aggre-
gated in the courses of the four radial tubes. But in now taking leave of the interesting
series of facts which have led to these inferences, I should like to observe that, while I
know the former cannot be modified by future investigation, I feel the latter may thus
be shown imperfect or untrue. Tt has not seemed to me, however, that this is a suffi-
cient reason to ayoid speculation at the stage which my inquiries have now reached. There can be no doubt that the facts concerning Tiaropsis indicans are of a highly st1g-
gestive character ; and I think it will shortly be found desirable thus to have paved the
way towards arriving at some sort of conception with regard to analogous, though far
more astonishing, facts which are presently to be adduced concerning Aurelia aurita.
