The results are interesting, as the iron
plates appear to follow a different law in their resistance to pressure to that of oak,
the strength being as the depth or thickness of the plates in the first case, and as
the squares of the depth in the second. The resistances are therefore in the ratio of
1:12, the iron being 12 times stronger than oak. In Part IV. we have some curious facts illustrative of the necessity and value of ex-
perimental research. In the earlier experiments of the inquiry it is evident, that angle
and T iron beams or frames are not the best, as regards form, to resist a transyerse
strain. In every case they are weak, and although exceedingly useful, and in fact
indispensable for many purposes of construction, they are nevertheless not calculated
to resist strain in the form of beams or girders.
