I now pass on to another consideration. MaccuLLocx was much struck with the
fact, that in many cases where a shelf crossed a rivulet, I mean one of those silver-
like threads of water which descend the flanks of steep mountains in nearly straight

marked upon the sand below by a deep and broad furrow, which remained visible for a long time afterwards,
as I have been informed by several members of the Society, who saw it after an interval of more than a year,”
I presume from the position of the stone as a land-mark, and from the distance it was transported by the rising
tide, that the furrow left by its passage must have been either oblique or parallel to the shore, What would
have been the effect if this large and heavy block had been pushed over a surface of solid rock instead of sand?_
This question will recall to the mind of those who have read the late papers of Mezsrs, CnanvuxTIER, VENETZ,
and Agase1z, the case of the longitudinally and obliquely scratched rocks of the Alps, In the Addenda to my
Journal during the voyage of the Beagle, I have endeavoured to show that the passage of ice, with imbedded
fragments of rock, acting at uccessive levels on the surface of shoals during the gradual rising of the land,
offers the most probable explanation of the scratches and grooves, which have justly excited s0 much attention
in Scotland and other places,

lines, it frequently entered a little way on each side of the gully. From this fact it
is evident that the gully must have been partly formed before or at the time when
the shelyes were sea-beaches. I particularly observed several instances of this struc-
ture. One which struck me most was in Glen Roy, opposite a gap in the mountain
which leads to Glen Fintec ; here two small threads of water were united at the point
where the line of shelf crossed them, and at their junction the rock was much ex-
posed, 80 that any one would have supposed that the furrow in which they flowed
had been entirely hollowed out by their action.
