Much greater advantage would probably have been gained by using
each half-leaf independently for experimental inoculations, thus doubling the
number of observations. Similarly, Samuet, Best, and Bap (1929) found, for
spotted wilt disease of tomatoes, that no advantage was gained by the use of control
half-leaves in this type of experiment. This may be due to the fact that with rubbing
experiments, it is inexpedient to follow each experimental inoculation with its
control, because of the danger of accidental infection. Consequently the experimental
and control inoculations were done in separate groups, which tends to decrease the
variation between leaves within plants, and between plants, at the expense of that
between half-leaves. As the results showed a considerable difference in susceptibility between leaves of
different ages, it was necessary to use the same leaf consistently for aphid infections
whenever possible, or else to use efficient randomization between different leaves.
