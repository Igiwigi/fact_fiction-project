Although the structures are [3
stable, they can merge if their distance reaches a critical value, which was reported to be five times : =
the gap width by [67]. However, [47] reported that the number, and thus the distance between the : Ss
DW depends on the deceleration rate of the inner cylinder, suggesting a spectrum of polymer :3

relaxation times f, governing the appearance of DW if the instability is considered purely elastic. The fact that the velocity profile across the core of the DW is not dependent on the elasticity
number and that the DW appear even at very low Re, below the stability limit of the base flow,
lead [67] to hypothesize a purely elastic nature for this instability. Thomas et al. [125] also observed
FP and DW numerically in TCs of purely elastic fluids, enforcing the previous hypothesis. The appearance of DW is attributed to a phase lag between the velocity gradient du,/dr
and the polymer elongation when the time scale of the cross-gap movement for a polymer
becomes comparable to its relaxation time (d/u; * te) [67].
