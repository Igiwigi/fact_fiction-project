important, in the context of this review, are two distinct
advantages of the single-particle over crystallographic
methods [12,13]. One is the fact that the imaging of the mol-
ecule in single, non-attached form is likely to yield a more
authentic structure—unaffected by interaction of the molecule
with its neighbours, and arguably more representative of the
free molecule in solution. In contrast, both X-ray crystallo-
graphy and electron crystallography [14] result in structures
that are influenced by the energy minimization inherent in
the formation of a closely packed crystal, and thus may signifi-
cantly differ from the structures assumed by the functional
molecule in the course of its work cycle. The second advan-
tage of single-particle techniques is related to the fact that

multiple equilibrating conformations and binding states of
the native molecule coexist that, as will become apparent,
can be recovered all at once in a single experiment. In contra-
distinction, crystallographic methods, with a few exceptions,
yield a single structure, selected by the minimization of
energy as the crystal is formed.
