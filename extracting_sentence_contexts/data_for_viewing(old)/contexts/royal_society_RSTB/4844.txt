—as seen in a vertical longitudinal section—appears as a tubular structure with a
flange-like portion abutting on the surface of the implant. The tubular segment
represents the original segment of the bronchus, the flange the layer of cells now
growing centrifugally from the lumen over the surface of the implant. Further
examination reveals a varying number of mitoses in the flange-like portion, which is
covered over by a layer of epithelial cells continuous with, and derived from, the
pre-existing bronchial epithelium. The cilia, when present (as in the larger bronchi in
the later period of foetal life), disappear in vitro. Consequently they cannot be found
either in the bronchus itself or in the layer of cells derived from it. Frequently, for
reasons unknown to me, a striated border is found at the unattached poles of the cells
of the cicatricial epithelium. They are very polymorphic and, generally speaking, the
further they grow from the parental epithelium, the less like it do they become. Owing
to the fact that, quite apart from mitotic division, much of the growth of the cicatricial
epithelium is due to that curious sliding motion of cells which is so frequent an occurrence
in these cultures, the contour of a rapidly-growing cicatricial epithelium is irregular,
owing to differences in the number of cell-layers in it, and also to the very variable
shape of its constituent cells, as they slide over one another. This type of movement
en masse is very like that which occurs during regeneration of epithelia im vivo, as
shown by Ranvier (37), Grroup (18), and others.

By the third or, at the most, by the fourth day the cicatricial epithelium is complete
and has invested all the naked surfaces of the culture. Its formation would appear to
be the rule in all cultures which show growth.

Its mode of origin is illustrated in Plate 16, fig. 6, which depicts in section of a four-day
