Examine the cause of this redistribution and its modus operands in producing the
Hbserved effect.
<Z In order to demonstrate that the phenomena, of sensitiveness are primarily due to
2 redistribution of electricity in the conductor caused by alterations in the electric

ndition of the interior of the tube, it is only necessary to observe that a non-
Aonductor, however highly charged, does not affect the sensitive discharge. Nor will
a conductor of small size, in contact with the tube (snch as a piece of tinfoil), affect
the discharge 80 long as it is ingulated. But if the tinfoil be connected to earth,
or to a distant conducting body, it at once produces a marked effect on the sensitive
discharge.

A consideration of these experimental facts leads to the following conelusions : (1)
that the effect is due to a redistribution of electricity in the conductor ; and (2) that
such effect is periodic. If a continuous electric state in the external body were the
necessary condition, the observed effect could be produced by charged non-conductors.
But as this is not the case, we musb look to the facility of change in electric state
