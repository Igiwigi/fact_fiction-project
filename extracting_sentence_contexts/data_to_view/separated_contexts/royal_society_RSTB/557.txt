Atwater concludes that his results do not settle whether the nitrogen gained was
acquired as free or combined nitrogen, by the foliage, or by the soil. He considers,
however, that, in his experiments, the conditions were not favourable for the action
either of electricity or of micro-organisms; and he favours the assumption that the
plants themselves were the agents. Lastly, he considers the fact of the acquisition of
free nitrogen in some way to be well established; and that thus facts of vegetable
production are explained, which otherwise remain unexplained. To this, and other
points involved, we shall refer again in our concluding remarks. Lastly, we have to summarise those of the results and conclusions of BoussINGAULT
which bear upon the present aspect of the question of the sources of the nitrogen of
vegetation.
