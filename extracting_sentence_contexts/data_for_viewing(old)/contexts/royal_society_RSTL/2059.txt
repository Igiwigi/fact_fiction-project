As this influence has been found to perform its functions in the animal eco-
nomy after it has been made to pass through a space not less than a quarter of

an inch between the divided ends of a nerve, we must suppose either that, like
magnetism or gravitation, it is capable of extending to a distance from the body
in which it exists, or of passing through other conductors than the neryes.
Were the former opinion correct, the influence of a nerve would extend in all
directions, which we know not to be the fact, nor would the presence of the
nerve be necessary to its functions, which we uniformly find to be the case.
The conclusion then from the foregoing fact is unavoidable, that the neryous
influence is capable of its functions after having passed through, and con-
sequently existed in, other conductors than the nerves. It is therefore not
peculiar to the neryous system, but capable of existing elsewhere, and con-
sequently is not to be regarded as, strictly speaking, one of the vital powers
of the animal body, but as an agent employed by them, On the other hand
we find that voltaic electricity, applied under the same cireumstances, is capa-
ble of all its functions, of exciting the muscles, of causing an eyolution of
caloric from arterial blood, of forming from the blood the various secreted
fluids, and maintaining all the other processes of assimilation on which the
healthy structure of every part depends *.
