* Taken on the average, there does not appear
to be any remarkable variation in either the shape or size of these cells as we pass
from one type of hair to another, so that if we are able to incorporate their properties
into the elastic theory, we dispose at once of point (i) above. We shall, in fact, postulate
forthwith that the elastic complex of the hair fibre arises out of the properties of the
individual biological cells from which it is built and the way they are fitted together,
in accordance with the scheme :—

(K,) inter-cellular keratin,
(K,) cell-wall keratin,
and (K,) intra-cellular keratin. Tt is interesting to note that Speaxmany has also attempted to explain the elastic
properties of the wool fibre in terms of its constituent biological units. He suggested
that “the elastic properties of the fibre as a whole are those of the single cell, which
is assumed to consist of an elastic cell wall, enclosing a fibrillar structure whose inter-
stices are filled with a viscous medium,” and that “ once this critical extension (HooKE’s
law) is exceeded, rapid extension commences and takes place chiefly by rotation of
fibrille.
