[98] provide more details of the dataset and propose a machine learning-based solution to this
forecasting problem. Figure 5 presents an example time series from this dataset.

Our initiative to archive data in a repository to better enable testing AI methods is not unique. For
instance, the Pangeo ecosystem (https://pangeo.io/) promotes open, reproducible and scalable
science. The community provides documentation, develops and maintains the software and
provides computing system architectures, focusing on open-source tools. It is in use by several
