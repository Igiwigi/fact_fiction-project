In the first place, if we
put, for D(Q), P, and suppose P to have for its components P= Pyz P. parallel to the axes,
then m2 det (D,(Q), R) has for its components parallel to z and to y,

m(yp.,—ap,) and m(ap,—2P),
and therefore the moment of mz det (D(Q), R) about the axis of » equals

mA(YPs—=@P,)/— (azp.—2pz)s} =m(2+})p,—My3P,—MESP.. Therefore, if we take the sum of these for all the particles and remember that the
axes are principal axes, that sum will equal p,Em(z*+z*) Now we have already

proved that p,, the component parallel to the axis of & of D(2), =. Hence we see
that the 8um of the moments about Or of the moving forces of which m det (D(Q), R)

is the type is A m_ and that this follows from the properties of principal axes, and from

: . dos;
the fact that the component of D,(Q) parallel to the axis of & is __

In the second place, we have already seen in section 30 of Chapter II. that the
moment about the axis of x of det (Q, V) equals —r#v, cos @, v, being the component of
V, and 9 the angle between the radius vector and V. But —r#v, cos © equals evidently —o,(a7,+y7,+27.), and »v, equals zx,—yz., If
then we observe that E(mav,)=0, E(myv,)=— E(mg*)z,, E(mzv,)=E(mz*)z,, it follows
easily from the above that the sum of the moments about Or of the moving forces, of
which m det (Q, V) is the type, equals Z(m2?) =,,—Z(mg*) n.#,=(C—B)z,v, This
last proposition may be also proved in a different manner, which will show its connexion
with the proof first given of EuLun's equations. The moment-axis, with respect to the origin, of the acceleration det (N, V) is
det {R, det (N, V)}, which, as we see from section 30 of Chapter II., equals a line oppo-
Site to V and of length vr cos ©; but it follows from the same section that, since Q is
perpendicular on V, det {Q, det (R, V)} equals a line opposite to V and of length
Tvr cos ©, Hence we have

det {R, det (QN, V)}=det {Q, det (R, V)}.
