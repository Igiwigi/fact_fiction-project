This infinity, being less
powerful than an infinity of the type (wâ€”@)-', does not interfere with absolute
convergence of the integral. Formal proof of this statement is considered unnecessary
here, being of a character readily suggested by familiar treatments of convergence
tests. It may be illustrated, in the hydro-dynamical application, by the fact that,
while a convex angle in the boundary gives rise to an infinite velocity, a convex
smooth curve does not. But, while there is no divergence of the integral, the formula (113) is nevertheless
indefinite in the absence of any specified functional relation between the variables @
and x. The Schwarz transformation takes account only of the angles of the
configuration to which it is applied, and leaves the adjustments of all lengths to
be dealt with after transformation by the assigning of suitable values to the
various parameters associated with w in the factors.
