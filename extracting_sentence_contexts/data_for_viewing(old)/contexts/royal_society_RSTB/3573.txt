We have already seen that the cause of the peculiar aggregation with which we
have been concerned is not explainable as due to currents set up in the water by the
unequal distribution of heat or by evaporation from the surface. Nor, as we shall see
later, is the phenomenon. the result of the purposeful movements of the organisms
themselves, but appears to be due mainly to the action of gravity combined with the
effects of cohesion phenomena, which are brought into play under the conditions of the
aggregation. The explanation offered is based mainly upon the observations which
have been made on the aggregation of Huglena viridis. Two distinct phenomena have
to be accounted for : (1) the cyclic up and down movements, and (2) the attraction of
the motile organisms into networks and groups. Both are concerned in the aggre-
gation, but (2) is dependent on (1), and both are primarily dependent upon (a) the
obvious fact that Euglena is capable of autonomous movements, and (b), which is
perhaps not so obvious, that it is distinctly heavier than water. The first problem
we have to consider, therefore, is the density of Euglena.

1. The Density of Euglena viridis,

If a tube about half an inch in diameter is filled with water containing a sufficient
number of Euglenz to give it a distinct green colour, and placed upright in the dark,
the majority of the organisms will, in the course of a few minutes, sink in the water
and form a dense green mass at the bottom of the tube. On turning the tube upside
down, still keeping it in the dark, the green mass of motile cells will begin to sink
again, and the downward movement is so regular that the rate of fall can be easily
observed. Experiments show that this varies with the number of Euglene in the
