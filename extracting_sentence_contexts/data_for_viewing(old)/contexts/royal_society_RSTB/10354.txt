2x 3x 1.5m flight arena, painted white around three sides,
using calibrated stereo-cameras (following the protocol
detailed previously [89,90]). Three-dimensional positional
data acquired at 500 Hz were used to fit a quintic spline with
a smoothing parameter based on autocorrelation of the
residuals [99]. We do not expect this exploratory behaviour to
exhibit the full repertoire of each species. In fact, it is clear
that it will not because we observed very little hovering flight
and the maximal speeds we recorded are below those reported
in the wild. Nevertheless, the standardization of our method is
useful for benchmarking a conservative flight performance
envelope. Moreover, the modal speeds we observed are
indeed the preferred speeds at which the dragonfly and dam-
selflies chose to fly within that well-defined and repeatable
setting. Here, we use these metrics to highlight coarse interspe-
cies variability and provide data for future investigations into
comparative flight performance.
