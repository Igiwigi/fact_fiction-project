taken out of the solution if it were measured in the ordinary way, and these are
angles of precisely the sort observed by BRAUNS.

When more than three images were yielded by an apparent octahedron face, they
were found to be due to the fact that there were two or more triakis-octahedra ;

these are generally two in number, one flatter than the other, and replacing the
upper and lower portions of the large apparent octahedron face (fig. 7).

An apparent octahedron face of alum gives, therefore, in general, not one but three
images. For the purpose of correct adjustment, and in order to distinguish easily
between the various images, I have generally used a small square aperture as
collimator signal in place of the customary Websky slit.
