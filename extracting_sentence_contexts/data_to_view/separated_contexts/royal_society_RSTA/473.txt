Our metalanguage allows
a user to write tactics — even invalid ones — with great freedom. But with this freedom he
can by no means generate an event that [...] is not a theorem. This follows from the fact
that events are objects of type theorem, and that the only operations for generating them
are the basic inference rules [...] and rules derived from them. This is a fine illustration of
the security provided by a type discipline; indeed, without it we could not claim to present
a viable methodology. It is the ability of LCF system users to safely program tactics without worrying about
soundness that make the tactic approach so attractive, and it is one of the aspects of LCF that
influenced subsequent work.
