As we will see in lemma 2.11, for 400 large enough H; has no eigenvalues with 4 < —Aco.
Therefore, we may restrict A to [—A.0,0]. For a fixed 4.9, we can view ®, as a continuous map
from the rectangle [—A.0,0] x [—00, L] to the space of Lagrangian planes A(n). Let 7, denote the
boundary of the image of this map, and define I, = {®—o0(Ya) | € [-Ac0, O)}, Fan = {Ps(Yo) |S €
[-00, L]}, P31 = {Pi (Yi)|4 €[0, —Aco]} and M1 = {s(Y—a,.) 1s € [-00, L]}, so that Ty, =U; Mi, as
in figure 1. As @s is continuous, Ij, is homotopic to a point; hence Mas(J7;D) = 0. Letting Aj,
denote the Maslov index of I, with respect to the Dirichlet subspace D, we have

Ait + Ao. +A3i t+ Agi =0. (2.5)

Remark 2.9. The Maslov index counts signed crossings and so, in general, |Aj| is a lower
bound for the total number of crossings. However, lemmas 3.3 and 3.4 imply that the crossings
along any given Ij; are of the same sign, which means |Aj,| is in fact equal to the number of
crossings.

(b) No crossings on 1}, and 4,
We now show that A; =0 and, provided A. is large enough, Aq; =0. We use the following
result.
Theorem 2.10 [29, theorem V.4.10]. Let 1 be self-adjoint and V € B(X) be a symmetric operator on
a Hilbert space X. Then
dist(Sp(H + V),Sp(H)) < IV Ilex).

Lemma 2.11. The following hold for all L € R:

(i) Ai =0.
