and the magnetostatic meter, and also made observations on the auxiliary thermo-
meters placed near the stem of the Baudin, in order to introduce the stem correction.

The Results.

x We divide our experiments into three series, but only attach any value to the

S third, as during the first two sets the thermometer was falling in the last period.

8 We had hoped, at first, to be able to apply a small correction, to eliminate the error

E which is due to the fact that a falling thermometer will read too high, and we made

& Ba large number of experiments to determine the correction. We arrived, however, at

S % the result that the indications of a falling thermometer are so irregular that no

â€˜e correction is possible. Consequently in our third series the thermometer was rising

wduring the whole course of each experiment.

% We think it worth while to put on record an impression that the behaviour of our

-2 Baudin thermometer has altered since we received it from the maker, As soon as it
