This condition of
hemianzsthesia, although fairly well marked, was in our experiments never complete,
nor was it permanent ; and, indeed, in most instances it was found to have disappeared
within a week of the operation. Since even with a tolerably extensive lesion in this
region we were not always able to substantiate the fact that there was a diminution
of sensibility produced, at least on testing the animals some hours after the operation,
and since also, when a distinct effect was obtained, it was comparatively transient, it
was difficult to be certain that the result yielded by the operation was really due to
the removal of a part of the cortex connected with the consciousness of sensations,
and might not be otherwise explained, as we have previously pointed out, by a
disturbance of the function of other parts, which must always be produced by any
extensive cerebral lesion ; and this explanation seems at all events as reasonable as one
which assumes that it is exclusively the region in question which is concerned with
the appreciation of tactile and painful sensibility. Another explanation is, however,
possible, and would equally well fit in with the facts which we have to record. For,
as we shall immediately show, the gyrus fornicatus is certainly connected with the
sensibility of the opposite side of the body. Now the gyrus fornicatus is anatomically
to be regarded as a direct continuation of the gyrus hippocampi (the two constituting
the great limbic lobe of Broca).
