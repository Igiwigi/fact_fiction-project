ance of the coil was taken at twelve different temperatures. A summary of
results is given at the end of this section (see p. 413), and a very slight increase in
the resistance is observable, amounting to one part in 22,000. It is satisfactory te
find that, whatever may be the effect of conduction through the water, it is, in thi
case, so small as to be unimportant.
The measurements of R, were made when the coil was immersed and the wate
stirred in the same manner as during the experiments, hence it follows that if th
water acted merely as a conductor it would in no way affect our results.
Even if its conductivity changed with the temperature our values of R include the
effects of such change, and the manner in which R is built up at each temporal 5
of no consequence.
Again, if electrolysis takes place (of which, however, we have had no sign), polari
tion must ensue. The best proof of the absence of polarization is the fact
when the storage and Clark cell circuits were reversed (and this was inve
done more than once during each J experiment) no readjustment of the rheochor
was required when using the platinum coil, although when using the manganine eo
a considerable readjustment was necessary.
Had electrolysis occurred, it is almost certain that HNO, would have bee
formed. In our earlier experiments (both in the platinum and silver calorimeters),

* Great difficulty was experienced in obtaining this specimen of pentane, and it was only thro
the kindness of Mr. Vernon Harcourr that we were able to procure it. It was prepared under his 0
direction and was free from all impurities, except some traces of tetrane and hexane.
