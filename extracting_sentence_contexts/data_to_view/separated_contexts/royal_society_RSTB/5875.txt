It is probable that the common ancestor of the
Branchiopoda and Malacostraca possessed a well-developed maxilla which functioned as a
feeding mechanism as in modern Malacostraca (CANNON, 1928, a, p. 820). The forward
stream of particles along the mid-ventral line to the mouth may have been an accidental
result of the primary respiratory stream. In fact, that particles were retained at all-in
the mid-ventral space resulted from the elaboration of the setal armature along the inner
edges of the limbs and this may have been primarily to get rid of those particles. The
self-cleaning system of sete on the endites may have been the method of keeping the
limbs clean so that the current of water over the gills was not impeded. Thus in the original minute Branchiopod the anteriorly directed food stream was
a secondary result.
