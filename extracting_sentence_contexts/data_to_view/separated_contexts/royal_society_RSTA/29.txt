It may be, also, that the vacuum at which the determinations of
ScHLEIERMACHER were made was of a higher order than mine of July 1 and 2, though
I do not think this probable. * I think, however, it is most likely that the true
explanation of the greater part, at least, of the difference lies in the fact that
ScHLEreRMACHER surrounded the wire with a glass envelope. It is impossible to
estimate with a non-diathermanous and badly conducting substance like glass how
much heat may be returned to the wire from the polished walls of the tube ; and it

found, with the exception of those given by Macrartanr, a few given by Piorgr, and one or two by
Kunpr and Warpoure, expressed in units of heat or units of energy emitted, under definite circumstances,
per square centimetre per second. * Son.ererMacner used the Brsset-Hacen pump, My experience of this pump does not lead me to
feel confidence in it as being capable of producing a very high vacuum.
