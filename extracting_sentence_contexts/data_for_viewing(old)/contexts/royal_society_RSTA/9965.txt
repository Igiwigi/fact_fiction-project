interference between two systems of advancing circular waves, generated by two pins
fastened to both prongs of a tuning-fork, being used.

Among the authors who have used the former method, only Dorszy and
Kotowrat-TsCHERWINSEI seem to have examined the magnitude of the wave-length

considerable irregularities near the generator, the wave-length here being dependent
on the distance from the plate and first becoming constant at a greater distance from
this. The authors mentioned, being aware of this fact, used for calculating the
surface-tension only the length of waves which were at a certain distance from
the glass-plate (Dorsey 4 cm., and Kotowrat-TscHERWINSKI 8 cm.). As the
wave-length near to the glass-plate was larger than further out, this may explain the
fact that Dorsry and especially KoLowrat-TscHEeRwinski have found lower values
than other investigators who have used the same method, but as it seems have not
taken precautions in this direction.

The other method, using the standing waves, suffers, as also KoLowrat-
TSCHERWINSKI remarks, from certain defects, because the measuring of the wave-
length taking place on the straight line which connects the above-mentioned pins,
those waves only can be examined which are at so short a distance from the pins that
there is no security of the phenomenon being sufficiently regular. On account of
