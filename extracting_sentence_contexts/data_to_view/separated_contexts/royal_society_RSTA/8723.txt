A. MILNE ON RADIATIVE EQUILIBRIUM. 207

pronounced as 4'T, decreases ; the darkening for given T, becomes more pronounced as
4 decreases, and for given 2 becomes more pronounced as T, decreases. This is merely
an expression of the fact that the intensity of radiation in any wave-length increases
more rapidly with the temperature the shorter the wave-length. Further, the larger is
21,, the smaller is the rate of change of the darkening with respect to 4T,. In fact,
for large values of AT, the law of darkening tends to a definite limiting form which is
easily calculated.
