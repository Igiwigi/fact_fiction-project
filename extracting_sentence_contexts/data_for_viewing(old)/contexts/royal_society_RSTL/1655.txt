Subsilicated fluat of ammonia has a pungent saline taste, It
Just perceptibly reddens litmus paper. Slowly evaporated, it
forms small transparent and brilliant crystals. The largest I
could obtain, appeared to be tetrahedral prisms. The solid salt
is very soluble in water; but is not deliquescent. When heated
it appears to sublime unaltered. It is curious that the solution
of this salt, when evaporated by a heat near its boiling point,
powerfully erodes the glass or porcelain vessel, and a residuum
of silex appears, on the addition of water, to redissolve the salt.
This erosion and residue of silex I have seen produced. three
times following, with the same quantity of salt. I mention the
fact, which, I believe, was before observed by SCHEELE, without

attetnpting an explanation-of it.. It may perhaps be said, that
as the water evaporates, the affinity of the subsilicated fluat for
Silex increases. ;

Subsilicated fluat of ammonia is decomposed by the sulphu=
ric acid, and by muriatic acid gas, and also by the fixed alkalies
and by ammonia,
