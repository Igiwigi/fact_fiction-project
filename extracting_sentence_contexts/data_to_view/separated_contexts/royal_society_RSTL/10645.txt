Several other experiments of a similar kind have shown that the sloping curves of
fig. 14 are thoroughly characteristic of strained iron. In fact the difference between
them and the curves of magnetisation of an annealed specimen is 80 distinetly marked

Athat it is easy, by applying this magnetising test, to distinguish a piece which has
been strained beyond its limit of elasticity from a piece which has not been 0 strained. BZ A comparison of figs.
