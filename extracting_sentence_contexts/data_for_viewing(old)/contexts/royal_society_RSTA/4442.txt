energy of IS1 is too low, which may poison the catalyst, indicating that the values of drate/dEts2
and drate/dEj\s; should be negative and positive, respectively. Thus, in order to optimize the
catalytic activity, the energies of TS2 and IS2 should move in the direction of drate/dEyts2 and
drate/dEjs1, respectively, which means that TS2 should be more stable, while IS2 should become
less stable. Therefore, the optimization of TOF is transformed to optimizing the energy vector, e.
It is interesting that the gradient expression of function , Vi(e), is similar to the one in the general
degree of rate control proposed by Campbell and co-workers [33].

To optimize the overall reaction rate, we can let the energy vector, e, move in the direction
of Vh(e). However, in some complex reactions, such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and methane
dry reforming, several tens or even hundreds of energies are involved. Considering the current
computation capacity, some approximations may be needed to simplify this optimization.
Regarding the elements in the energy vector, e, they are in fact not independent of each
other. Firstly, the energies of transition states are correlated with the enthalpy changes of
the corresponding steps, known as the BEP relation [21], which can be introduced into the
optimization to approximately halve the size of the energy vector. Secondly, Nerskov and co-
workers [22] proposed a linear scaling, which states that the adsorption energies of many species
