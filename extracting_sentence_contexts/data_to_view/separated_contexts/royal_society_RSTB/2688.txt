Now, in connection with the above experiments, we may suppose that the leaf-cells
of wheat, barley, &¢., contain substances peculiar to each species, which when the
cells are vigorous and the leaf is uninjured, are able to prevent the successful attack
of any mildew except the one “biologic form” which has become specialised to
overcome the resistance. When the vitality of the cells, however, becomes affected
by injury, either these substances are destroyed, or become weakened, or the
production of them by the protoplasm is interfered with, in the leaf-cells in the
neighbourhood of the injury, with the result that the conidia of other “ biologic
forms” are now able to infect them, since they no longer meet with any special
substance able to injure them,

I would point out here that the present experiments furnish conclusive and direct
proof that, as regards the Mrysiphacee, the immunity of a certain host-species
against the attacks of other “ biologic forms” than its own in no way depends on
any anatomical or structural peculiarities—such as hairs, ribs, thickness of the cell-
wall or cuticle, or the chemical nature of the cell-wall, &e.—since in the experiments
where a “cut” leaf became susceptible to a “ biologic form” otherwise incapable of
infecting it, the conidia were sown on the uninjured epidermis of the leaf. It seems to me possible also that we may find in the facts shown by the above
experiments the explanation of a phenomenon which so frequently confronts plant-

pathologists, viz., the sudden appearance of a parasitic fungus disease on plants which
had hitherto proved immune. As the above experiments prove, it needs only an
injury to be made to the leaves of certain plants in order to render them susceptible
to disease, although otherwise they remain immune; and since, as experiments
further proved, when the fungus has gained a footing on the injured parts, it can at
once spread to uninjured parts, we can see how plants, the leaves of which have been
injured by animals, hail, storms of winds, &c., may become the starting-point of a new
disease.
