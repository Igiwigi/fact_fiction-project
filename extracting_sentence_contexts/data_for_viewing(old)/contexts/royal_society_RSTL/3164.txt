been denied, and that by a writer of no mean abilities. The opposite error,
however, is the more common ; and not a few havye ascribed, and even till do
ascribe, the motion of the blood throughont the whole course of circulation to
the contractile power of the heart alone, although it would not be difficult to
prove that to drive the blood through one set of capillary vessels, and still more
through two or three sets of such yessels,—for in man himself, in one important
part of the circulation, it is carried through two, and in some animals through
three, sets of capillaries before it returns to the heart, —lI say it would not be
difficult to prove that to drive it through one set of capillaries, at the rate at
which the blood is known to move, would require a force capable of bursting
any of the vessels. But here, as in the former instance, it is better to appeal
to the evidence of direct facts than to any train of reasoning; and there is no
want of such facts to determine the point before us, some of which I formerly
had the honour to lay before the Society, and others are stated in my Treatise
on the Vital Functions. The most decisive is, that the motion of the blood in
the capillaries continues long after the heart has ceased to beat and the animal
in the common acceptation of the term is dead, even in the warm-blooded
animal, for an hour and a half or two bours, and it is not for some time sen-

sibly affected by the heart's ceasing to beat; nor does this arise from some
imperceptible impulse still given by the heart, because when all the vessels
attached to this organ are secured by a ligature and the heart cut out, the
