N/10 iodine in place of
7-61 c.c. actually obtained experimentally). It is also obvious that no substituted
iodine derivatives other than iodoform are produced. The divergence between
the experimental and theoretical figures is probably due to the fact that the iodoform
undergoes slight decomposition in the alkaline hypoiodite solution with the formation
of a corresponding amount of iodide.

(3). Estimation of Formic Acid.—The method of estimation finally adopted was based
on that described by Fincxe (1913). The details are :—

To 10 c.c. of a M/100 solution of kojic acid were added 120 c.c. of water, and 50 ¢.c.
of the alkaline hypoiodite solution, prepared as described in the estimation of iodoform,
followed by 5 ¢.c. of N/I sulphuric acid and then 5 c.c. of N/L sodium hydroxide.
