Thus it appears that the green colour of the tubercles of the “ back”’ is due to the
superposition of yellow pigment upon the blue “ layer,” the blue colour of the margin
is due to the “ blue layer’ in the absence of yellow pigment, the orange colour of the
“bands” is due to the orange chromatophores and the absence of the “ blue layer”
from this region. Maximum darkening is of course due to extreme distal migration
of the melanophore pigment in all tubercles.

It is a fact of considerable interest that the bright colours seen in adult chameleons
are not present in young ones. As is well known, Lophosawra pumila is a viviparous
species. Many births have occurred in the laboratory. The young ones are in-
variably grey in colour, becoming almost white in conditions of extreme pallor, and
black when maximally dark. No green, orange or blue colours are present, although
a little brownish-yellow has been seen in the “bands” of some individuals. The
pigments appear only when the chameleons are nearly full grown. ‘The average length
of an adult female, from the snout to the tip of the tail, is about 15 cm. The males
are somewhat smaller. The average length of new-born chameleons is 4-2 cm.
Females 12 cm. in length are still unpigmented, males of this size are already beginning
to show some green and yellow colour. These observations suggest an interesting
speculation concerning the more primitive phylogenetic origin of melanophores as
compared with other pigment cells. They are in agreement with the observations
