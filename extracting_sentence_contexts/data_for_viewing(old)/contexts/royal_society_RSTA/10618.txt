The results of the different equilibrations and the computation of the density of ice
for different temperatures below 0° C. are set out in Table IV.

In this table the letters prefixed to the equilibrations in columns IL. and IIL,
indicate the order in which these numbers were obtained. In finding the numbers
in column IX., the values of ¢ is only needed to four significant figures; but to
compute the density of ice at different temperatures (column XI.) this same quantity
q is 0793829.

The whole of the equilibrations performed with the final form of apparatus are
given in the table. An improvement of the filler was introduced subsequently and
anomalous results were obtained for the only experiment carried out. This was
traced to the fact that the wire had become damaged during the filling, and the
results for this experiment were rejected.

In the case of the first experiment the water was equilibrated at the beginning
and end, and the mean value was used for computation. The ice in this experiment
was not examined. In Experiments 2 and 3, the ice was taken out after the last
equilibration and was found to be free from milkiness and air bubbles, but it
had fine circular cracks running round it concentric with the central stem of the
umbrella.

The fourth experiment was conducted differently from the others, and the values
obtained proved unmistakably that the same specimen of water may assume different
densities on freezing. After the value b had been obtained, the ice was permitted to
