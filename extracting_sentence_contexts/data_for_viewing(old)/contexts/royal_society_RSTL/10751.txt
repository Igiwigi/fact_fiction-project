this is joined by the second pair, a thicker trunk being the result ; then the third
pair join in like manner, and finally the fourth (Zpbr. A. 4).
& The regular manner in which the epibranchials of Mustelus unite is worthy of
Botice as a clearly primitive arrangement. In the Rays (23, fig. 20), Tolocephali
+00 36, fig. 17), and Teleoster (23, fig. 32), two or more of the epibranchials of
he same side unite with one another before joining with those of the opposite
Side.
5 In the embryo the aortic arches are continued directly from the ventral to the
Porzal aorta, In Holocephali (Plate 36, fig. 17) and Teleostes there is only one
erent artery to each gill, corresponding to the anterior of the two efferent arteries
--n the plagiostome holobranch. This is very evident in Callorhynehus, in which
Sho single efferent artery of each gill is always cephalad of the corresponding
erent trunk. These facts tend to confirm the opinion to which one is led by the
-Zimple inspection of the parts in the adult Mustelus (compare figs. 6 and 17) ; namely
hat the anterior efferent artery of each holobranch (Zf. br. A. 2, 4, 6, and 8) is
Fo be looked upon as its primary revehent trunk and as strictly continuons with
She corresponding epibranchial artery, the posterior efferent artery being a secondary
Sessel which debouches not into the primary trunk of its own, but into that of the
ext following gill.

Satisfactory to find that the views just enunciated are largely confirmed by embryology.
