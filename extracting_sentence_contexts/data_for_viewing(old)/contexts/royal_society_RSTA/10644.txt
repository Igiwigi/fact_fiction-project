Nernst (‘Zeitschrift fiir Electro-chemie,’ 3, 308, 1897) has described a lecture
experiment, which shows the motion of a coloured margin, that between potassium
permanganate and potassium nitrate. The success of the experiment depends on
the selection of pairs of solutions whose ions on either side of the boundary possess
the same specific velocities, a condition that is fulfilled in the case of the -ions
MnO, and NO,.

The author (Sreene, ‘Chem. Soc. Journ.,’ 79, 414, 1901) has sueceeded in extending
Masson’s method in two directions.

The first extension consists in the substitution of aqueous for gelatine solutions
of the salt to be measured. By this means many salts which will not form solid
jellies with gelatine may be investigated. The second depends on the fact that it
has been found possible to observe the boundary between two colourless solutions,
on account of their difference in refractive index, thus rendering the use of the
coloured indicator solutions unnecessary.

The method compares the velocity of the anion and cation, and therefore determines
