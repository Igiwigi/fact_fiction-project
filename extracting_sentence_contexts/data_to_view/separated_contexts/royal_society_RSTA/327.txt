Numerical optimization in the space of
orthogonal matrices tends to be faster and more stable than in the general space of matrices,
which is probably the main reason for making this transformation. It is important to point out that whitening is not uniquely defined. In fact, if z is white, then
any orthogonal transform Uz, with U being an orthogonal matrix, is white as well. This highlights
the importance of non-Gaussianity: mere information of uncorrelatedness does not lead to a
unique decomposition. Because, for Gaussian variables, uncorrelatedness implies independence,
whitening exhausts all the dependence information in the data, and we can estimate the mixing
matrix only up to an arbitrary orthogonal matrix.
