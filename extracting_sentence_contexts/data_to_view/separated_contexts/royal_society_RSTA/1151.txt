It is the achievement
of Batty, Borichev & Tomilov [66] to extend the basic result from [76] and the classical Ingham—

Karamata-Riesz theorem to general p and to allow functions K of the form (1 + s)“M(s)8 (for some
a, B > 0) instead of just K = M. In this case, Mx and Miog do not differ essentially. There is also an


extensive discussion in [66, Section 4] of the fact that more general functions K are possible, too. In
fact, there are sometimes non-trivial relations between the functions M and K, and the interplay
between the shape of 2y and the growth of f in 2y can be analysed by means of more or less
standard techniques of complex analysis, such as the theory of harmonic measure. For instance,
if M(s) = C(1 + s)* and iff grows polynomially in 2y, then, as was noted in [77, Lemma 3.4], one
necessarily has FI <Ce(1 + |z|%**) for all z € cy for an appropriate constant c > 1.
