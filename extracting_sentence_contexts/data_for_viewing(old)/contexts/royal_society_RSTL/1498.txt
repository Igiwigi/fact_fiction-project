some new Obyects in Chemical Phitosophy. 67

V. Some Considerations of Theory illustrated by new Facts.

HypROGENE is the body which combines with the largest
proportion of oxygene, and yet it forms with it a neutral
compound. This on the hypothesis of electrical energy would
shew, that it must be much more highly positive than any
other substance ; and therefore, if it be an oxide, it is not likely
that it should be deprived of oxygene by any simple chemical
attractions. The fact of its forming a substance approaching
to an acid in- its nature, when combined with a metallic sub-
stance, tellurium, is opposed to the idea of its being a gaseous
metal, and perhaps to the idea that it is simple, or that it exists
in its common form in the amalgam of ammonium. The
phenomena presented by sulphuretted hydrogene, are of the
same kind, and lead to similar conclusions.

Muriatic acid gas, as I have shewn, and as is further proved
by the researches .of MM. Gay -Lussac/and THENARD, is a
compound of a body unknown in a separate state, and water.
The. water, I believe, cannot be decompounded, unless a
new combination.is formed ; thus it-is_ not changed by char-
