usually occurred in the course of the same evenings; and sometimes these
variations took place on eyenings when I did not remark any luminous
appearance in the northern horizon.

All the variations at night were towards the east 4, whether the aurora was
actually visible or not ; and hence may we not conclude, taking it for granted
that it is an electrical phenomenon, and that it usually moves from about the
north towards the south, that it must be of the nature of positive electricity ?
And, by a parity of reasoning, may we not assume the existence of an opposite
state of electrica√û action by day, in order to account for the diurnal westerly
variation, which is most considerable in the summer in these latitudes, when
the aurora prevails about the south pole? This idea seems to be strengthened
by a fact I have noticed, that the magnetic intensity is usually less considerable
in summer before the middle of the day than it is afterwards ; s0 that the
minimum intensity commonly occurs some hours before the maximum tem-
perature.

It is evident that the elevation of the aurora must often be exceedingly great,
probably much more than a thousand miles, as it seems to be generally scen from
places very distant from each other at the same time, and in nearly the same

* 1 did not observe the needles before 7 2.x.

+ I have since obseryed a slight westerly yariation in the needle at night, but this seems to be of
rare occurrence,
