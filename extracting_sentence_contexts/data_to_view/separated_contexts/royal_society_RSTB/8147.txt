stylized facts empirical evidence
feeding during starvation, organisms are able to reproduce animals: Kjesbu er al. (1991), Hirche & Kattner
(1993) and Kirk (1997)
during starvation, organisms are able to grow animals: Stromgren & Cary (1984), Russell &

Wootton (1992), Roberts er al. 2001, Dou et al.
(2002), Gallardo et al. (2004) and Zheng et al.

(2005)

during starvation, organisms are able to survive for animals: Stockhoff (1991) and Letcher er al. (1996)

some time bacteria: Kunji et al. (1993)
growth the growth of isomorphic organisms at abundant food animals: Frazer et al. (1990), Strum (1991), Chen

is well described by the von Bertalanffy growth et al. (1992), Schwartz & Hundertmark (1993),
curve Putter (1920) and von Bertalanffy (1938) Ferreira & Russ (1994) and Ross er al. (1995)

for different constant food levels the inverse von animals: Summers (1971), Galluci & Quinn (1979),
Bertalanffy growth rate increases linearly with Weindruch et al. (1986), Hubert et al. (2000) and
ultimate length Putter (1920) Kooijman (2010, pp.48)

many species do not stop growing after reproduction animals: Shine & Iverson (1995) and Jorgensen &
has started, i.e. they exhibit indeterminate Fiksen (2006)
growth Heino & Kaitala (1999) and Kozlowski
(1996)

holometabolic insects are an exception foetuses animals: Huggett & Widdas (1951) and Zonneveld &
increase in weight approximately proportional to Kooijman (1993)

cubed time Huggett & Widdas (1951)
the von Bertalanffy growth rate of different species bacteria: Kooijman (2000, pp. 276-282)

corrected for a common body temperature yeasts: Kooijman (2000, pp. 276-282)
decreases almost proportional to maximum body animals: Kooijman (2000, pp. 276-282)
length
reproduction reproduction increases with size intraspecifically but animals: Peters (1983) and Kooijman (2010,
decreases with size interspecifically pp. 69,323)
respiration freshly laid eggs do not use dioxygen in significant animals: Whitehead (1987), Romijn & Lokhorst
amounts (1951), Pettit (1982) and Bucher (1983)
the use of dioxygen increases with decreasing mass in animals: Romijn & Lokhorst (1951), Richman
embryos and increases with mass in juveniles and (1958), Pettit (1982), Bucher (1983), Whitehead
adults (1987), Clarke & Johnston (1999) and Savage ez al.
(2004)
the use of dioxygen scales approximately with body animals: Richman (1958), Clarke & Johnston 1999
weight raised to a power close to 0.75 Kleiber and Savage et al. (2004)
(1932)
organisms show a transient increase in metabolic rate animals: Janes & Chappell (1995), Chappell et ai.
after ingesting food (heat increment of feeding) (1997), Hawkins et al. (1997), Rosen & Trites
(1997) and Nespolo et al. (2005)
ageing lifespan increases with size for endotherms, but is animals: Finch (1990) and Ricklefs & Finch (1995)

independent of size in ectotherms

stoichiometry chemical body composition of well- and poorly- animals: Hirche & Kattner (1993), Du & Mai (2004),
