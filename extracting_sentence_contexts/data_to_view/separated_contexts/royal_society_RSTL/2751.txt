The experiments by which all the other functions just mentioned, with the
exception of the maintenance of animal temperature, have been ascertained to
be functions of the nervous power, I have laid before the Society, which has
done me the honour to publish them. From these experiments it appeared
that the functions in question were always destroyed by depriving their
organs of the influence of the nervous system. That the maintenance of
animal temperature is a function of the nervous system, properly s0 called,
appears from a variety of facts generally known, the temperature either of a
part or of the whole body being lessened by any cause that impairs the action
of particular neryes in the former instance, or of the whole nervous system in
the latter. The question then is, is the nervous system capable of all these
functions after the sensorial power is withdrawn? At the moment of what we call death, the seneorial functions cease, the
animal no longer feels or wills.
