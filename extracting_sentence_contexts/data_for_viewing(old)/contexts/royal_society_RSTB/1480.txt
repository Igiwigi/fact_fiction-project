@  (3.) If the stomata be mechanically blocked an appreciable osmosis of CO, may
@ take place through the cuticle provided that the tension of the CO, be great enough.

= (4.) The normal amount of CO, in the atmosphere is not sufficient to produce any
& appreciable osmosis into a leaf with its stomata blocked; assimilation therefore
cannot continue under these conditions.

g  (5.) The experimental optimum of CO, for assimilation depends on the structural
3 porosity of the leaf, so that if this be reduced by blocking the stomata, even pure CO,
@ May not quite effect optimal assimilation.

¢ (6.) To this, and not to the stomata being inoperative in gaseous exchange (which
& was Bousstncavuur's view), is due the fact that in concentrated CO, a leaf with its
stomata open assimilates less than one with the stomata blocked.

(7.) In bright light a fully green leaf assimilates all the CO, that it is forming
by respiration and none escapes from it. GARREAU’s demonstration to the contrary
is only an expression of the imperfection of the conditions under which it was
performed.

Finally I should like to express my thanks to Deputy-Professor Darwin and other
colleagues for putting my time as far as possible at my own disposal for the
Prosecution of this somewhat laborious research and for much other encouragement.
