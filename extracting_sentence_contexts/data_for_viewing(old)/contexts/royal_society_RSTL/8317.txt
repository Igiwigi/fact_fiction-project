this bone is put into its proper category : thus we have four © periotic ” bony centres. T
now have to speak of another periotic bone, the nature of which I have long pondered over,
namely the © postfrontal.” 'This bone, which was s0 called by Cuvrizr, but has nothing
in common with his Reptilian postfrontal (a mere postorbital investing plate), begins as
a delicate tract of osteoblasts immediately outside the ampulla of the anterior semicir-
cular canal ; another ossifying tract begins oyer the ampulla and arch of the horizontal
canal, this is the © pterotic;” a third over the ampulla of the posterior canal, this is the
< opisthotic;” a fourth over the arch of that canal, the < epiotic;” whilst the fore edge
of the periotic capsule is ossified by the © prootic.” I thus anticipate my descriptions
for the sake of starting fair in my terminology ; T propose the term * sphenotic ”” for the
antero-superior or postfrontal bony centre.

As 800n as possible all the terms must be put into harmony with the facts of mor-
phology, and terms that are applied to two different parts in different Classes must be
got rid of if they can conveniently be spared. Thus the term prefrontal, which is applied
to a mere investing bone in one case and to the lateral mass of the ethmoid in another,
onght to give way, in one case to preorbita]
term, namely © ecto-ethmoid.”

I have long ceased to use 8nch terms as * os transversum,

, and in the other to a true morphological

: ” * ectopterygoid,” and
* entopterygoid,” as they do not mean the sxame thing in the Fish as in the *Sauropsida *”
