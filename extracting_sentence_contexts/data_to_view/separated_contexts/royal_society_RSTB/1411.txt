Sometimes a few oval pits are seen on the tangential
transitional region, before they disappear altogether.

- oblique terminal walls of the traches have similar pits to those of the

ntial sections we frequently find the pits well shown in sectional view.*
they are evidently bordered, the thickened ridges distinctly over-arching

‘eases. Between two trachez the pits are bordered on both sides ; between

bordered pits, the border being on the side towards the trachea. (See

fig. 9, A and B.)

e general form of the tracheal elements, and especialiy from their tapering
mpression is strongly conveyed that they are tracheides and not vessels.
ue terminal walls have the same pitted structure as the lateral walls, and

mptional cases, however, we have found occasional traces of transverse walls

wv instancest the transverse wall is unmistakeable, and indeed seems to
