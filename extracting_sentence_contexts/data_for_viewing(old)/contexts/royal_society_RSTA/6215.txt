Braneworld models nowadays abound. They have different motivations than the original
brane models, but they all show the richness of brane cosmological ideas. Two such models are
briefly noted below, one motivated by an attempt for a successful resolution of the cosmological
constant problem, and the other by an adaptation of holographic ideas in cosmology. For
a resolution of the 4 problem in a higher-dimensional, brane setting, one uses a self-tuning
mechanism and considers a single 3-brane universe in a five-dimensional bulk space with linear


or nonlinear bulk-fluids (cf. [114] and related references therein). The main question here is whether
there are regular solutions that satisfy a number of plausible physical criteria (finite Planck mass,
energy conditions, etc.). In these braneworld models, ‘everything depends on the extra transverse
Y-coordinate’, grossly violating the cylinder condition met in the original Kaluza—Klein universes.
On the other hand, a particularly interesting feature of these models is the fact that a Wick-type of
exchange between the time and the transverse spatial coordinates leads to cosmological models
with many features having brane-theoretic origins.

The last brane model we discuss is ambient cosmology. This is an attempt to relate holographic
techniques [115] in a braneworld setting with methods of conformal geometry to motivate the
idea that the brane representing ‘our world’ has moved to the conformal infinity of the bulk, the
‘ambient space’. The resulting ambient cosmology has a number of novel characteristics that allow
for previous problems such as the singularity problem and the question of cosmic censorship to
be resolved very smoothly in this set-up [116].

In conclusion, braneworld cosmology presents interesting, well-posed problems for the future
in terms of challenging the predictions of inflation as viable alternatives, as well as a variety of
