linear theory, results should be independent to the wave amplitude when it is normalized by A. :&
Thus, any difference in these cases is due to the nonlinear effect. Figure 11a shows that the drift
motion in surge is large, while the drift motions in heave and pitch in figure 11b,c are very small.
This is because the restoring force in surge is small, while large in heave and pitch. Table 2 shows
that the surge natural frequency is much lower than that in pitch. When the wave frequency is
near the pitch natural frequency, no resonance is expected to be excited by w in surge and it is even
far less likely by 2w or 3w. Figure 11a shows that the oscillatory motion of surge is dominated by
the component of w, while motions at 2w and 3w are small. The figure also shows that the drift
motion of surge ¢1/A is very much affected by A, as ¢) is dominated by the term proportional A’,
in this case based on the perturbation theory. The amplitude of the oscillatory motion of ¢)/A at w
is not very much affected by A, as it is dominated by the linear term. Figure 11b,c shows that heave
and pitch motions are not dominated by a single frequency, even at a smaller wave amplitude. In
fact, as the triple wave frequency is set at the natural frequency of pitch, which is also close to that
of heave (table 2), the nonlinear components in the motions will be relatively more significant.
Because of this, as A increases, the heave and pitch motions at 2m and 3w become more and more
pronounced. However, compared with the surge motion, the overall motion amplitudes of heave
or pitch are still much smaller. Thus, the motion of the platform has a component with lower
frequency and larger amplitude, as well as larger drift, and a component with higher frequency
and smaller amplitude.

To analyse the tensions in tendons caused by the platform motions, equation (3.2) can be
written as

(P? + Q?)x + 2Q
