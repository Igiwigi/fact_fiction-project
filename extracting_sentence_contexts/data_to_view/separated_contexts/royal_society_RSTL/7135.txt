as the symbol of the unit of sal-ammoniac,

(anxnwn)=atax a),

and
2m =3,
2m =1,
2mg=1I,

and the symbol of sal-ammoniac is («%), and cannot be expressed by an integral number
of the prime factors a, x, ». We may now inquire whether, seeing this expression of the s&ymbol of chloride of
ammonium to be impossible on the assumption that the symbols of the elements hydrogen,
chlorine, and nitrogen are of the forms &«, «x, a1?, it be possible on any other hypothesis
as to these symbols, consistent with known facts. Now every possible hypothesis as
to these symbols consistent with their expression by an integral number of prime
factors in the equations from which the symbols have been derived, and with the expres-
8ion of the symbol of hydrogen by one prime factor, «, is, as has been shown (Sec. VIL.
(5) and (8)), implicitly contained in the general forms of the symbols of chlorine and
nitrogen, which are respectively &*24/0+29 and o/#2490*9; whence, putting
