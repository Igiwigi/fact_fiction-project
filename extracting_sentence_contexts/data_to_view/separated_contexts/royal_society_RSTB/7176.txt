to a structure which overhangs the gonopore. Snodgrass (1904) gave
the name central vesicle to a very similar structure in Tipulidae without discriminating
between the real pompetta and the outer apodemal structure. I propose to call this
apodemal structure the piston hood, since the piston rod is, in fact, a part of it shaped as
such to serve the pumping function. ;

The ejaculatory duct passes underneath the piston hood and between the horns of its
deeply emarginate anterior border and under its arch until it reaches the small box of the
pompetta which it enters through a hole in the roof. The opening in the pompetta leading to the penis tube lies in front of a deep pit in the
floor of the box and somewhat anterior to the opening of the ejaculatory duct.
