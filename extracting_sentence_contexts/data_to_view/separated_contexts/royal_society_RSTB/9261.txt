With an increased understanding of how pharmacological interventions affect
the behavioural and neural processing of emotional information, we can also gain
a unique perspective into how clinically useful drugs might exert their effects. Rather than being secondary to the clinical effects of these drugs, the neuro-
psychological changes may in fact produce these clinical effects. To take the
example above, perhaps the reduction of amygdala response to fearful faces
after benzodiazepine administration is in fact instrumental in decreasing anxiety. This is the basis for the neurocognitive model for understanding treatment action
in depression. Models of treatment action in depression have generally focused on the
molecular and cellular changes thought to underlie the clinical response.
