Most writers upon this sub-
ject have considered the column of fluid over the orifice as the
expelling force, and from thence some have deduced the velo-
city at the orifice to be that which a body would acquire in
falling down the whole depth of the fluid; and others that ac-
quired in falling through half the depth, without any regard

to the magnitude of the orifice ; whereas it is manifest from
experiment, that the velocity at the orifice, the depth of the
fluid being the same, depends upon the proportion which the
magnitude of the orifice bears to the magnitude of the bottom
of the vessel, supposing, for instance, the vessel to be a cylin-
der standing on its base ; and in all cases the velocity, ceteris
"paribus, will depend upon the ratio between the magnitude of
the orifice and that of the surface of the fluid. Conclusions
thus contrary to matter of fact show, either that the principle
assumed is not true, or that the deductions from it are not
applicable to the present case. The most celebrated theories
upon this subject are those of D. BerxoviLLi and M.
