ty acquired while the ship is building, by passing electro-currents through the

"There is some obscurity in both specifications, from the patentee not ate,
between electric currents and lines of magnetic force ; but whatever may be the SGT
of the method described in the provisional specification, it is certain that that method
would be utterly inadequate to produce any sensible effect in a large ship.

} 'The method described in the final specification would no doubt produce, wherever
| applied, some local effect ; but the effect produced by the local application of magnetic
force of high and rapidly varying intensity must necessarily be wholly different, from that
hich has arisen from the general application of a force of low and uniform intensity.
nd the former cannot possibly produce any general destruction of the latter. The pro-
Zcos is in fact not one of general demagnetization, but of partial counter magnetization. EZThe result will be an irregular distribution of magnetism of very variable intensity,
Enecessarily very unstable, and producing, wherever effective, a rapidly varying field of
