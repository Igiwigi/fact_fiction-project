Supposing them to augment in magnitude until they come, not only within range of the
microscope, but within range of the unaided senses. Let it be assumed that our know-
ledge of them under these cireumstances remains as defective as it is now—that we
do not know whether they are germs, particles of dead organic dust, or particles of
mineral matter. Suppose a vessel (ﬆy a flower-pot) to be at hand filled with nutri-
tious earth, with which we mix our unknown particles, and that in forty-eight hours
subsequently buds and blades of well-defined cresses and grasses appear above the
80il. Suppose the experiment when repeated a hundred times to yield the same un-
varying result. What would be our conclusion? Should we regard those living
plants as the product of dead dust, of mineral particles? or should we regard them as
the offspring of living seeds? The reply is unavoidable. We should undoubtedly con-
8ider the experiment with the flower-pot as clearing up our preexisting ignorance ; we
should regard the fact of their producing cresses and grasses as proof positive that the
particles 8own in the earth of the pot were the seeds of the plants which have grown
from them. It would be simply monstrous to conclude that they had been © spon-
taneously generated.”

This reasoning applies word for word to the development of Bacteria from that floating
matter which the electric beam reveals in the air, and in the absence of which no Bac-
terial life has been generated. TI cannot see a flaw in the reasoning ; and it is 80 simple
as to render it unlikely that the notion of Bacterial life developed from dead dust can
ever gain currency among the members of the medical profession.

1t has been said of those whom the evidence adduced in favour of spontaneous genera-
tion fails to convince, that they seem willing to believe in almost any infringement of
