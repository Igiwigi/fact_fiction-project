Or we may consider the possibility that E-ness is not of itself a type of sinistrality,
but the product of an independent gene whose only phenotypic effect is the modification
of sinistrality towards the production of odd dextrals and other monstrous forms, the
allelomorph being simply the absence of E-ness. This interpretation involves the
possibility that E-ness might be carried in « strains, though it could obtain expression
only in sinistral snails. It is in a general way not inconsistent with most of our facts. Against it is (a) the impossibility of being sure that we ever have sinistrality completely
free of E-ness, (b) the failure to get a definite separation of < from « among the recessive
segregates of A x K crosses and in E x K crosses, and (c) the emergence of high E-ness
in F, of an A x K cross in which the « and « lines had been pure for four generations
