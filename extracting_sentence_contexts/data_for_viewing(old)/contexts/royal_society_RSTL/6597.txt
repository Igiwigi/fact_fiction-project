We thus ee that these well-known equations of EuLs are found at once by resolying
D\(H) along the principal axes, where H is the axis of the body's momentum-couple
and has Aw,, Bo,, Cw, for its components, and that they merely express the fact that G,
the resultant of I, M, N, is identical with D(H).

62. The theory of the motion of a body about a fixed point can be more simply inves-
tigated, and the problems connected with that theory can generally be more easily solyed,
by merely bearing in mind that G=D(H) than by using EvLER's equations, which
merely expres that fact in one particular form; for that form is not always the most
convenient form, and is in all cases apt to conceal the fact which it embodies.

Take, for instance, the problem of a body rotating about a fixed point, no external
forces acting on it. Tere D(H)=0, therefore I is a line of constant length and direc-
tion. The motion of the body must therefore entirely depend upon the fact that, whilst
the body moves about the principal axes with angular velocities w,, m,, w,, the line H, whose
projections on those axes are respectively Aw, Bo,, Cz,, remains throughout the body's
motion the same in magnitude and direction.
