pathologists, viz., the sudden appearance of a parasitic fungus disease on plants which
had hitherto proved immune. As the above experiments prove, it needs only an
injury to be made to the leaves of certain plants in order to render them susceptible
to disease, although otherwise they remain immune; and since, as experiments
further proved, when the fungus has gained a footing on the injured parts, it can at
once spread to uninjured parts, we can see how plants, the leaves of which have been
injured by animals, hail, storms of winds, &c., may become the starting-point of a new
disease.

It is worthy of note that the cases in which conidia of one “ biologic form” were
sown on the cut surface of the leaf of a host-species of another “ biologic form,” and
proved under these conditions able to infect a plant otherwise immune to it, present
a close and interesting parallel to the biological facts obtaining in the class of
parasitic fungi known as “wound parasites” — Polyporus, Botrytis, Nectria,
Cucurbitaria, Peziza willkommii, &e.—which are able to infect their hosts only
through a wound.

My sincere thanks are due to Professor MArsHatt Warp, F.R.S., for his kind
assistance and permission to carry out this work in the Cambridge University
Botanical Laboratory.
