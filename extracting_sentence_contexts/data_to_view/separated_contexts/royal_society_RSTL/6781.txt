They haye in vain tried mercu-
rials, -ſudorifics, and every other regimen uſed in
venereal complaints, under a notion, that this leproſy
was the conſequence of ſome venereal taint : but,
inſtead of being. of ſervice, theſe methods rather
ſerved to deſtroy the patients; for, far from leſſening
the diſeaſe, the antivenereal medicines unlocked the
diſtemper, the moſt dreadful ſymptoms appeared,
and all thoſe ſo treated periſhed ſome years ſooner
than the others, who did not take theſe medicines. A very juſt fear of being infe&ed with this cruel
diſtemper ; the difficulty of examining infe&ted per-

became; vacant in the iſland of Cayenne, The mini-
{ter was. pleaſed to name me for.it ; and altho' this
iſland, was much more fertile in philoſophical diſco-
veries than all the others, he thought proper to
change my deſtination, and ſent me to this ifle
Guadaloupe; and did not forget the article of the
leproſy in my inſtructions. When I arrived at Martinico in 1727, Monſieur
Blondel de Juvencourt, then intendant of the French

court, and all «the memoirs, -that related to this
affair.
