56,

sac, and find that, as I have shown in the preceding pages, it is essentially identical
with the very characteristic structure of the retina of the pineal eye, that we see the
strongest reason, so far as Sphenodon itself is concerned, for regarding these two
organs as bilaterally homologous. The pineal sac has, I believe, undergone a remark-
able change both as regards position and function, which may sufficiently account for
the fact that its nerve is apparently no longer especially related to the right habenular
ganglion,

The case of Sphenodon cannot, however, be considered alone, and when we come to
examine other types we shall find the evidence enormously strengthened.

(b) Evidence derived from the Study of other Types: a. Cyclostomes.—The
lampreys furnish us with peculiarly satisfactory evidence in favour of the bilateral
theory, because in these animals it is the sight and not the left pineal organ which is
developed as a pineal eye, while the left one (“parapineal organ”) remains in a
vestigial condition. Moreover, in the type examined by myself (Geotria) I have
been able to demonstrate that the nerve of the right-hand member of the pair is
especially connected with the right habenular ganglion, though it also appears to
send fibres to the posterior commissure.
