9. With regard to circulation in the rear of the aérofoil, it was found that the vorticity
was mainly confined to a comparatively narrow wake, but tended to diffuse fairly rapidly. This was shown by the fact that there was quite distinct evidence of a certain amount of
circulation around a contour entirely above or entirely below the core of the wake
within certain limits, although a contour extending well above and below the wake, and
drawn so as to cut the wake at an angle not too far from 90°, would give zero circulation. In this connection it is interesting to note that the experimental results bear out Prof.
Taytor’s argument* that a contour enclosing the aérofoil, but including unequal
amounts of the positive and negative vorticity in the wake, would not give the circu-
lation corresponding to the lift. The discrepancy is not usually appreciable unless the
contour cuts the wake at an angle very considerably less than 45°.
