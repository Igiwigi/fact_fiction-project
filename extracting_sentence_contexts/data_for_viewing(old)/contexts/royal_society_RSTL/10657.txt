Sregion cannot, be explained away on any theory of mere proximity of the lesions to the
sensory tracts of the hemisphere. For in this case the lesion was nearer the crus
cerebri than in any of the others.

When the cornu ammonis alone was the seat, of lesion, as in the left hemisphere of
Experiment 33, there was for a time very marked anzsthesia of the opposite side.
But here, also, as in the cases where the gyrus hippocampl alone was injured, the
symptoms were only of temporary duration.

These facts, therefore, how that the hippocampus and hippocampal gyrus form
parts of the same centre, and that complete destruction of both structures is necessary
to secure complete and permanent anzsthesia. But to effect this primarily is both
