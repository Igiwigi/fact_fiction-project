However, the effect of noise on the likelihood of transitions
depends on whether noise is multiplied by, or added to, the state variable of a
system [37]. Overall, the DFA method appears to give the least ambiguous results (table 1). However, this may simply reflect the fact that only the sliding window length
is varied in the DFA method, whereas for the ACF method and the variance
calculation, filtering bandwidth is also varied, and this tends to cause greater
variation in the sign of the Kendall trend statistic.

5. Conclusion

From our results, we can offer some general guidelines for analyses aimed at
detecting the signal of critical slowing down as an early warning of approaching
bifurcation. Prior to trying to extract early warning indicators, it is important to consider
aggregating data where it may be of sufficiently high temporal resolution to be
sampling fast decay modes in the system in question.
