This is of course
necessary for a constant of swinging motion of the linear orbits of a two-dimensional harmonic
oscillator, represented by a point on the equator of the Poincaré sphere (and in which opposite
directions in real space are identified). This contrasts with angular momentum L, which has a
definite sign of rotational motion—a roundabout—that depends on the relative phase between
swings in x and y. From the Hamiltonian viewpoint, this distinction comes from the fact that,
although M,M and L are all quadratic in the canonical variables Qy, Qy, Px, Py (and hence on
an equal footing in the Poisson algebra), L is linear in the momentum variables alone (also the
position variables alone), whereas M, Mare quadratic in the momenta, and also the positions; the
constants of the motion can detect the sign of angular momentum, but not linear momentum. Of course, this set-up can be quantized directly to study the quantum polarization properties
of photons. However, we instead are considering a different physical situation, that of the scalar
behaviour of Gaussian laser modes in the focal plane, which nevertheless has strong mathematical
analogies with this view of the Poincaré sphere, even if the physical relationship is not (yet) clear.
