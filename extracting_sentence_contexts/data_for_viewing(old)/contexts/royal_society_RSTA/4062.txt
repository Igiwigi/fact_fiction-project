In the case of Heusler alloys, the influence of a magnetic field on the elastocaloric effect induced
by the application of uniaxial compressive stress has been reported in [22]. In spite of the fact that
only relatively low stresses (about 10 MPa) were applied owing to poor mechanical properties
characteristic of this class of materials, results provide evidence for a significant elastocaloric effect
associated with the large entropy change at the magnetostructural phase transition undergone by
the material. Interestingly, application of a magnetic field below 1T was found to increase the
elastocaloric relative cooling power by about 20%. Similarly, the effect of an applied electric field
on the elastocaloric response of ferroelectric Pb(Mnq/3Nb2/3)03-32PbTiO; single crystals induced
by uniaxial compressive stress has been reported in [23]. The effect has been found to be quite
small. More interesting seems to be the enhancement of the electrocaloric effect associated with
an applied uniaxial compressive stress.

The possibility of electric control of the magnetocaloric effect (or, conversely, magnetic
control of the electrocaloric effect) in strain-mediated extrinsic multiferroic systems has been
