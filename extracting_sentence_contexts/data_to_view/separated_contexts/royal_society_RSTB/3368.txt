308 MR. W. HEAPE ON THE PROPORTION OF THE SEXES

The figures available for Cuba emphasise this point. Among whites the net
increase shows an excess of F., but it would be wrong to describe this result as
a consequence of increased prosperity, for it is due solely to an excessive M. death-
rate and the apparently favourable condition of this race in Cuba is fictitious. Among coloured people, however, a much higher proportion of F. are produced ;
potentially in this respect they have advantage over the whites, but an excessive
F. death-rate at the present time annuls that advantage, and from the point of view
of increase they take the second place. How low this second place is a further
examination of the figures will show.
