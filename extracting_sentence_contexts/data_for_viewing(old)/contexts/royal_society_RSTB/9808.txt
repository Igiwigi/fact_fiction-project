The three approaches presented above are likely to have a
progressive decreasing influence on the jury, since the first
strand tends to be considered more objective and the last
one tends to be regarded as being more questionable and

credibility—typically based on an expert’s experience, quali-
fications, reputation and performance. The fact that expert
credibility has a significant influence on the jury can be
seen from a number of cases where scientific debates in the
court were adjudicated on this basis.'*!> This way of influen-

where a claim is accepted or rejected on the basis of an irre-

testing the science by means of testing the expert’s back-
ground has also been raised by the jury in Tang,'” who
pertinently asked the judge in connection with the expert tes-

should not be the case, even acknowledging how important
