between the individual cells, especially between thick-walled cells, and between cells
of the medullary rays and the adjacent cells, and (ii) gross slips of wood tissue in the
spring wood layers due to incipient failure of the most thin-walled cells. In many
woods both kinds will probably take place, but the first are most likely to occur in
homogeneous woods, and the second in light coniferous woods.

§ 24. Summary of Conclusions.—lt appears that the chief cause of the anisotropic
character of the elasticity of wood is to be found in the fact that wood is built wp of cells, of
which the majority are long hollow cylinders, arranged parallel to the grain. The exis-
tence of the medullary rays is also an important factor in producing this anisotropic
elasticity. Mathematical analysis shows that these two features of the structure of wood
are sufficient to account for (i) the fact that wood has, at any point, three planes of elastic
symmetry, and (ii) the numerical relations that exist between the three Youne’s moduli
and the six Porsson’s ratios which are implied by this symmetry. It thus appears
unnecessary to make any assumption as to the character of the cell-wall substance
(e.g., Whether it is anisotropic or not) in order to explain the observed elastic properties
of wood.

It is perhaps worth emphasising that a body can possess an anisotropic elasticity
due to the microscopic distribution of material in its structure, for this possibility must
