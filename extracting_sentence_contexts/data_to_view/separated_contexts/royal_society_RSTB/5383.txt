Below the pre-zygapophysis we get
the connective tissue roof (now ossified) of the next vertebra. This section passes through the junction of the two vertebre and we get the fibrous

layers on the two sides of the spinal cord, the existence of which in previous stages has
been already mentioned, when part of the connective tissue arch remained as fibrous
connective tissue at the junction of the two vertebra and the remaining portions of
this arch became ossified. â€˜To prove that this is the junction of two vertebrae we have
the articulation of the zygapophyses and also the ball and the socket portion of the
former intervertebral cartilage. The notochord is very much reduced owing to the
fact that the ball portion of the intervertebral cartilage has constricted it. Outside the
cartilaginous mass of the ball we get the socket which is in osseous condition and there
is a continuous cavity, the synovial cavity, between the ball and the socket.
_ The supradorsal element is in the posterior limit of a vertebra and does not carry a
spine. The spine originates from the connective tissue arch element, and not from the
dorsal arcualia.
