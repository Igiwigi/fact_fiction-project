ance there is a systematic consistency in the particulars which have been cited, which,
even in this, the infancy of the inquiry, promises to conduct those who will pursue it to
the recognition of one of those laws of general application which characterize the ope-
ration of great cosmical forces.

A corresponding accordance in the phenomena of the lunar influence on the InclinaÂ»
tion and on the Total Force might easily be shown; even from the very brief record which
we as yet possess from the very few stations at which the phenomena have been made
the objects of investigation, carried on with suitable instruments and with suitable
methods of reduction. 'The conclusions from them are indeed somewhat less precis
than in the case of the Declination, because the conditions of the problem are necessarily
more complex; but they have the same general character and bearing in all material
respects; and enough has already been stated to establish the general fact of the exist-
ence and systematic action of the moon's magnetic influence at the surface of our
globe, and to show that its phenomena are quite within the reach of properly directed
research ; and that they are assuredly well worthy of the attention of those who occupy
themselvyes in the pursuits of inductive philosophy.

To establish on a satisfactory basis the existence of a difference in the amount of the
lunar-diurnal variation at the times when the moon is nearest to or furthest from the
earth, would probably require many more years of observation than have hitherto been
given to the 8ubject at Kew. But it. may not be superfluous to state that in the Vertical
Force, which is the only one of the elements in which the extreme deflections at the
turning hours on the two days preceding and the two days subsequent to the epochs of
Perigee and apogee have hitherto been separately examined, the deflections are decidedly
