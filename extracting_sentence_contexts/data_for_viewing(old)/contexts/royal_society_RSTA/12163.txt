change, is the current in the wire. But all these circumstances concerning it h
been made out from the dynamics alone, electric phraseology being-employed only t
facilitate the quotation of known analytical theorems about potential functions, ani
about how their distribution through space is connected with the forms of surfs
to which their fluxes are at right angles, and over which they therefore have ther
selves constant values.

Tf now while a current is flowing round the circuit, the two condensers are imagine
to be instantaneously removed, and the wire made continuous, we shall be left wi
an ordinary circuital current, which in the absence of dissipative resistance will floy
on for ever.

48. The argument in the above rests on the fact that there is circuital change of at
elastic displacement d/dt (f, g, h) distributed throughout the dielectric, while the
medium is discontinuous at the surface of the perfectly conducting wire beca e
displacement cannot be sustained inside the wire. When we for purposes of calculation
imagine the elastic quality to extend across the section of the wire, and so ayoil
consideration of the discontinuity in the medium, we must imagine as above a flow
rotational displacement along the wire so long as the capacity of one of the condensers —
is being altered; and the velocity in the field will be deducible, by the ordinary a
formule for a continuous medium, from this ideal flow together with the actu:
changes of displacement throughout the dielectric. For a perfect conductor
circumstances will be exactly represented by confining this flow to its surface; wha
is required to make the analytical formule applicable, without modification ©
account of discontinuity in the medium, is simply the addition of such an ideal flow
