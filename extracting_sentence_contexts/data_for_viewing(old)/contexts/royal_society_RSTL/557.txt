combustion at the surface of contact of the inflammable matter :
and the fact is proved by holding a taper or a piece of burning

appear in the centre of the other flame, proving that there is
oxygene even in its interior part.

The heat communicated by flame must depend upon its
mass; this is shown ,by the fact that the top of a slender
cylinder of wire-gauze hardly ever becomes dull red in the‚Äù
experiment on an explosive mixture, whilst in a larger cylin-
der, made of the same material, the central part of the top
800n becomes bright red. A large quantity of cold air thrown
upon a small flame, lowers its heat beyond the explosive
point, and in extinguishing a flame by blowing upon it, the
effect is probably principally produced by this cause, assisted
by a dilution of the explosive mixture.

If a piece of wire-gauze sieve is held over a flame of a lamp
or of coal gas, it prevents the flame from passing it, and the
phenomenon is precisely similar to that exhibited by the wire-
