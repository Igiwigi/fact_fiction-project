In addition, our goal is to consider a thought-
experiment not a physical experiment: how does geometry induce wrinkling, when a thin elastic
sheet is required to conform to a sphere? With these considerations in mind, we take the view that
the Winkler model used in (2.1) is appropriate for our purposes. In fact, Winkler-type substrate terms have been used to model many experiments. In [1,2,4,7]
(see also [5]), such a term arises from the gravitational potential of the fluid below the sheet. There
is, however, an important difference: in that work the prefactor scales as h-1, whereas in (2.1) it
scales as h~?.
