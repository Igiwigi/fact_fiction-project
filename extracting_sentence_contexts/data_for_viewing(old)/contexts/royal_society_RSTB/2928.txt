of the curve. Then an expiration follows, and immediately the pressure gives way a
little, to rise once more with the next inspiration, As the vaso-motor centre becomes
more and more enfeebled these curves become less marked, and by the time the
centre no longer responds to stimulation of the central end of the sciatic nerve they
have disappeared, the centre being now completely paralysed, although adrenal
extract will still produce a temporary rise of pressure by contracting the peripheral
vessels. The respirations now grow less and less frequent, and are of a convulsive
nature, and then finally cease, and then death takes place.

If, on the other hand, the dose is still less, and the vaso-motor centre begins to
recover its tone, the blood pressure rises slowly once more, and coincidently the
respirations improve in frequency, and recovery takes place in spite of complete
incoagulability of the blood, and well-marked visceral hemorrhages. All the facts
recorded can, then, be explained as a result of paralysis of the central vaso-motor
centre, and in no other way.

III. Action on the Respiratory Centre.

The failure of respiration occurring in the case of Viperine poisons can best be
explained as being secondary to the failure of the circulation brought about by the
central vaso-motor paralysis. Whether they have any direct action on the respiratory
centre as well, as held by Werk Mircwety and Retcuert and by FLEXNER in the case
of the Rattlesnake, is open to doubt. In favour of such an action is the fact that in
the cases in which small doses of Daboia venom were given, to induce the negative
phase of reduced coagulability, the number of respirations were nearly always reduced
