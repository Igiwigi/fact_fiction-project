Any remaining issues then largely involve: (a) development of robust models for Rix and
(b) determination of an appropriate solution to the adjoint vector Green’s function and, therefore,
the propagator tensor. The present contribution focuses on the propagation aspect of the jet noise problem. We
use the fact that non-parallel flow effects enter the lowest order asymptotic expansion of the
propagator tensor when use is made of the low-frequency asymptotic theory developed by
Goldstein, Sescu & Afsar [14] (hereafter referred to as GSA) that appeared to capture the
qualitative structure of non-parallelism found in the full numerical solution of the ALEE [15]. That is, inclusion of mean flow spreading effects into the propagator solution can increase the
low-frequency radiation by almost 10 decibels (dB) at @ =30° on a high subsonic jet compared
with the equivalent parallel flow solution of the ALEE [8,15]. GSA constructed an asymptotic
solution to the adjoint vector Green’s function to explain this finding by using a slowly
diverging jet approximation in which the jet spread rate, €, is asymptotically small, inasmuch
as ¢€ <O(1) where the propagator is sought at low frequencies of the same order as the jet
spread rate (i.e. w~e€) and is then matched with the outer wave equation solution at O(1/e)
radial distances.
