We made this voyage from Southampton
to Barbados, Hayti, Jamaica and Colon (Panama) and back, The unwearying
services and numerous valuable suggestions of Captain MILNER, Mr. Joxiirre, the
chief officer of the “Para,” and Mr. Hiypmarcu, the chief engineer, while we were

aboard, contributed greatly to such success as we may have attained. Our knowledge of the phyto-plankton of the high seas has been derived almost
exclusively from the observations and collections made by zoologists, who have
advanced their part of the study of plankton with far greater zeal than has been

shown by botanists, The “Challenger” Expedition left many problems unsettled,

and the Hensen Expedition, accompanied by a botanist (Dr. Scutrr) skilled in the
minute examination of such organisms, though it accomplished great things, still left —
a legacy of doubts on many points, and in fact proclaimed more loudly than ever the —
richness of this field of investigation,

The method of collection was to pump a steady stream of sea-water through fine
silk nets. We employed No. 20 miller’s silk by three different makers, and though
there were at first differences in capacity of these silks for stopping organisms, they —
soon became fairly equal with use. It has been assumed in making estimates of the
amount of plankton that No, 20 silk practically stops all organisms, or at least with a
degree of error that may be calculated.
