The difficulty which I had experienced
in identifying what I had seen of the structure and development of human bone, with
the descriptions given by MuLLen, Tomes, 'Topp, Bowman and others, led me to take
up the examination of these forms of osseons tissne, in the hope that they would
throw some additional light on the question. The wide difference also which existed
between the views of Owey and Acass1z as to their mode of growth, rendered a
further inquiry into the development of the scales necessary. I hope and believe that
the facts about to be brought forward will at least be found sufficiently conclusive to
settle the question ; by showing that, whilst the scales are formed, as originally stated
by M: Acass1z, by the apposition of snccessive layers, these layers are not generated
by any process of secretion, but by the calcification of an organized basis, resembling
that of bones and teeth, as asserted by Professor OweN. Though M. Acass1z has already investigated the structure of the scales of Lepi-
dosteus osseus and Polypterus niloticus}, the importance of an accurate knowledge of
these recent types of the Sauroid group of fish, in contributing to the illustration of
the fossil species, led me again to snbject the scales of Lepidosteus osseus to a careful
examination : whilst the result has been confirmatory of most of the observations of
M.
