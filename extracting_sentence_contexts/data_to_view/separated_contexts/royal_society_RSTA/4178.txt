By integrating equation (2.6) in each
frequency band, we compute the indices within the low frequency (LF = 0.04-0.15 Hz) and high
frequency (HF = 0.14-0.45 Hz) ranges, along with their ratio (LF/HF).

(d) Maximal information coefficient

In order to quantify the coupling between two variables, we calculated the MIC [66]. This index,
in fact, is able to quantify linear and nonlinear couplings occurring between two variables over
time, x and y [66]. MIC relies on the fact that, if two variables are somehow coupled, then a grid
can be drawn on the scatterplot of the two variables. Formally, let Gxxy indicate all the possible partitions with x rows and y columns of the
scatterplot for the ordered pairs of two vectors, and I, the mutual information for one specific
partition with x x y grids that are applied to the ordered samples of the two vectors. MIC is defined as the maximal value of mm over the ordered pairs (x, y), with x <n and y <n,
where 1 is the length of the vectors:

max {Ig}

Guxy
8EGrxy (2.7)

Mhoxy = log min{x, y}"

In practice, it is possible to compute the estimation as MIC = max{itxxy} with B empirically
axy<

defined as B = n°-° [66].

(e) Statistical analysis =

Statistical analyses were performed on MIC values, considering data gathered from all of the :8
subjects, in order to perform (i) comparison between resting state sessions; (ii) comparison : a
between neutral sessions; (iii) comparison between (whole) arousal sessions; (iv) comparison is
between pleasant and unpleasant stimuli of each arousal sessions; and (v) comparison between tw
pleasant/unpleasant stimuli among different arousal levels.
