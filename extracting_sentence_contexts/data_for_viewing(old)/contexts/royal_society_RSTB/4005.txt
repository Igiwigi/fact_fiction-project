seeds, but this was probably due to the size of the maternal envelope, and was
not a true case of heredity. The second case concerns the seed-coats of peas, and
was worked out by TscHermaK. The only part of the work which concerns us
here is the following. When a plant having round seeds is crossed with another
having “ indent” seeds, the seed character of the hybrids is that of the female parent.
Bateson pointed out that the cause of this is probably similar to that in the case of
the wheat seeds.

While the case of Znotheru is comparable with the inheritance through one parent
in Echinoderms, the direct influence of the mother on the form of the seeds is a
phenomenon of another nature. Referring to the latter cases BavrEson (5) says:
“This group of cases introduces us to several points of interest. We have first the
remarkable fact that the mother plant can impress varietal characters on her offspring
by influences which are not heredity in the ordinary sense. Seeds are in botany what
larvee are in zoology, and no example is yet known in which the maternal impress
extends beyond the seed stage. But without any serious stretch of the imagination
we may suppose that a maternal impress may be such as to produce a lasting effect,
at least for the life-time of the immediate offspring.” We would rather say, however,
that seeds in botany may perhaps be compared with embryos in zoology, but not
with larvee. It is well known that embryos can have their characters affected when
they undergo a part of their development in contact with the mother. It is, however,
impossible that such characters as those we have investigated in the free-living larvee
of Echinoderms could owe their development or non-development to any parental
influence other than true heredity.
