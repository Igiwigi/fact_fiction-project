the dynamical problem of the proper vibrations of the crystal only under the con-
dition that the system can be considered as closed, i.e. that there is no emission of
radiation. It will be seen, however, that this is the case for all values of k except k = 0.
In these cases (k +- 0) the total moment of the crystal must vanish, since all the dipoles
in the crystal vibrate with a difference of phase which is not invariant against a trans-
lation of the lattice vector. That can be seen at once (cf. Born and Goeppert-Mayer
1933, Pp. 643) from the expression for the total moment itself

This sum is zero for all values of k except k = 0.
I shall now show that our solution for the Hertz vector corresponds to this fact.
The optical properties of crystals have been carefully investigated by Ewald (cf. Born
