the page. More formally, if we implement this idea for the momenta (p1,p2 -.. pn), we are led to
define a polygon in four-space, with vertices at x;, where p; = x; — x;-1. We may consider x, = xo
as chosen arbitrarily, and then all the other x; are determined. Functions of the p; can be translated
into functions of the x;, and clearly must have the property of being invariant under x; > x; + ¢,
where c is any constant four-vector. If the functions of the p; depend only on sums of consecutive
Pi, we can say more than this. The corresponding function of the x; can depend only on vectors of
form x; — xj.


The property of dual conformal symmetry is that if a colour-stripped amplitude is written in
this way, it is invariant not only under the translation x; > x; + c, but also under any conformal
transformation of the x-space. In 2008, this was shown to be valid at least up to one loop in
N=4 planar gauge theory [20]. It is of course immediate from this fact that twistor variables can
be used to render these functions manifestly dual-conformally invariant. In 2009, the concept of
momentum-twistor variables was introduced [21], to perform this function, and they have since
then been widely adopted for this purpose.

8. Polytopes and the amplituhedron

The introduction of momentum twistor variables immediately indicated a new and useful
structure governing the tree-level amplitudes for gauge theory. At the simplest level, of MHV

amplitudes, there is nothing new to say. The next simplest level is that of the NMHV amplitudes. : =
A process in which three negative helicity gluons interact and produce (n — 3) negative gluons is : Sy
an NMHV process, along with all its crossing-related versions. For such amplitudes, momentum- a
