The statement that the importance of changing wave activity on sea ice is unclear due to
limited process understanding [30-32] is the most direct reference to the MIZ. The last comment should be heeded by the MIZ community, as it expresses the opinion that
there is not yet sufficient confidence in understanding of the MIZ and its trends for it to influence
policy. In fact, there are very few studies that connect the MIZ to climate-scale behaviours of
either the Arctic or Antarctic ice covers, with the most notable exception being by Kohout et
al.â€™s [30] correlation of trends in the location of the Antarctic ice edge and trends in local wave
energy. Integration of MIZ dynamics in Earth system models is the most accessible path to


impact climate studies. It has been described as the holy grail for MIZ research by Squire [33], and
there is considerable momentum towards the goal, as is evident from articles in the theme issue
[9,11].
