which consists in the power of rotating at will either eye outwards. This power of
unilateral excursion, common to certain of the Reptiles, such as the Chameleons,
must be due to a special mechanism of co-ordination, and it would be worth while
investigating whether there is any variation in the optic commissure.

3. Hyenide.—All the Hyzenas, viz., H. striata, H. crocuta (Spotted Hyena), and
H. brunnea (Brown Hyzena), resemble the Felidee and some of the Viverridee, having
the same retinal vascularisation, and the fundus divided into three zones—the peri-
pheral violet, the intermediate green, and the central golden yellow. The dise is
brown and not cupped ; the fundus is covered with minute dots as in the Felide.
The pupils of all three species are vertically oval when the animal is at rest. As
soon as it is disturbed by any noise or in any other way, the pupils instantaneously
dilate to a complete circle as if the animal had its iris under control. The fact that
the Hyzenas are distinctly night animals may account for this dilatation of the pupil
when the animal is roused. This likewise accounts for the brilliant yellow central
zone which throughout the Carnivora invariably occurs in nocturnal animals, being
least marked in those which prowl at dusk only.

4. Canide.—The fundus of the wild Canide, like that of the Felide, Viverride,
and Hyeenide, is divided into three zones—a peripheral zone of reddish or violet-
brown, a green intermediate zone, and a central zone of bright golden yellow,
characteristic of night animals, the Tapetum lucidum being covered with minute dots
or patches. The disc is never cupped, and varies in shape in the different genera.
The distribution of vessels is similar to that of the higher families, but the vessels
tend upwards before spreading out, and do not always radiate directly from the disc,
