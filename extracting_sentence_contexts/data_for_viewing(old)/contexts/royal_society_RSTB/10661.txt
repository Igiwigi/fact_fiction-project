H 7. Temporal trends in body size

s s We have demonstrated positive viability selection on body size

well as carry-over effects between seasons, and these relate to
ECEs and to mean temperatures. The evidence that body size

response to this selection in the form of increased body size

over time and there was no change in the mean size of
scrubwrens.
