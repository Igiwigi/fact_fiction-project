amino acid in the case of ClpXP translocating a denatured sub-
strate [78]. If indeed full-length VipB protein were to be
threaded through ClpV, up to 500 molecules of ATP could be
consumed per subunit and that could be as much as 750 000
molecules of ATP for a single sheath. However, it is possible
that it is not necessary to unfold the full-length VipB to disas-
semble a contracted sheath. As ClpV pulls on the VipB
N-terminus, the sheath polymer could be destabilized
and broken into individual subunits. The unfolding of VipB
could be then terminated by dissociation of ClpV from the
monomeric sheath subunit, thus saving ATP.

Another important cost comes from the fact that Hep is a
structural component, which is secreted into the environment
in large quantities in many T6SS+ organisms. Hep can
be detected as an abundant secreted protein in organisms
such as V. cholerae, A. baylyi, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and
E. tarda [2,6,7,67,87]. Because of the extensive structural and
functional homology between T6SS and contractile tails, it is
probably safe to assume that each ring of sheath interacts
with one ring of Hep as it is in the R-type pyocin [46]. This
means that up to 700 molecules of Hep are secreted out of
the cell every time a full-length sheath contracts. Assuming
only one contraction per 5 min and the molecular weight of
Hep to be 18 kDa, then 10Â° cells (1 ml of OD 1 culture) will
