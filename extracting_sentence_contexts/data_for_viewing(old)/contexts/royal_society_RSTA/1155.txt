and hydrodynamic modes, eventually leading to positive growth rates, i.e. linear instabilities.
Consequently, one can expect the critical Mach number, that was obtained with the D2Q9-DVBE,


to be an upper limit of linear stability domains obtained after the numerical discretization. This
point will be further investigated hereafter.

(c) Linear stability domain

A set of partial differential equations, either continuous or discrete in both space and time, is
considered to be linearly stable if and only if the growth rate of perturbations Im() remains
negative whatever the value of the wavenumber k [57,100,128]. Put simply, it translates to the
fact that perturbations should not be amplified over time by the system, but instead they should
decay following dissipative laws, imposed by both the physics and the numerical discretization,
and that depend on their wavenumber k.

Hereafter, we will use this stability criterion to compute the maximal Mach number for v €
[10-6, 107-1], where the lower value is typical of airflow simulations in under-resolved conditions
while the upper value is chosen so that the continuum limit assumption remains valid. In

addition, contrary to previous analyses assuming a critical stability for waves propagating in : =
the direction of the mean flow [8,65], every combination has been considered here. The same goes : =
for the orientation of the mean flow, meaning that u = (u cos ¢, usin @) with ¢ € [0, 27] in the most 13
general case. The above methodology drastically increases the time required for the computation : =
of the stability domains. Hence, it is worth noting that lattice symmetry properties can be invoked : 8
