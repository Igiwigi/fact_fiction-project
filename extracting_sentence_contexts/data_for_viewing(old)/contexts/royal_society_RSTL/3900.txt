essentially on the current as denoted by the galvanometer. There was every reason,
with these facts before us, to expect that the battery, which did not produce a current,
would not evince any degree of chemical decomposition. Recourse was, however,
had to the test of experiment ; and, instead of introducing the galvanometer, I snb-
stituted for it a small piece of bibulous paper, saturated with a soJution of iodide of
potassium ; the gold leaves of the electroscope diverged as before, but, however long
the duration of action, not the least indication of the liberation of iodine was per-
ceptible. The inference I make from this is, that no definite chemical action took
place in any cell of the battery, and consequently that the electric effects above
shown, and which are termed satic effects, take place before or independently of the
actual development of the chemical effects.

23, I am aware that, in some form or other, this fact has been acknowledged by the
most strenuous adyocates of the chemical theory. BzcquereLy thus adverts to it :â€”
*We must conclude, from all the electrical phenomena, that, in almost all cases, a che-
mical action has taken place; and hence we are led to believe that the latter is the cause
which exercises the greatest degree of influence over their production ; nevertheless,

in the present condition of science, we must not yet abandon Vorra's theory, since it
may very readily happen, that, at the contact of two bodies, a disengagement of elec-
