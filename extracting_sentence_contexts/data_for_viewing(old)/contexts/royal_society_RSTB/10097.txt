corroborate a decline in richness across the J/K boundary,
the sampling rates for the early part of the Cretaceous are
estimated to be much lower than Late Jurassic (figure 1), and
the differences in sampling rates are particularly pronounced
for the sauropodomorph clade. While the richness for all dino-
saurs is estimated to decrease (figure 2 top panel), this signal is
equivocal for any of the subclades whose confidence intervals
for richness in the Berriasian are wide (and span the richness
in the Tithonian) due to low and uncertain sampling probabil-
ities. Genus-level analyses (see the electronic supplementary
material, table S2) estimate that the number of sauropodo-
morph genera in the Berriasian is in fact the same before and
after the J/K boundary. It is also worth emphasizing that
the confidence intervals for the estimated species diversity
are much wider in the Berriasian compared with Tithonian,
implying that an increase in the true richness across this bound-
ary cannot be excluded. Lower sampling rates during the
Berriasian across all dinosaur clades and regardless of
whether species- or genus-level data are used, suggest that
this ‘clear diversity loss’, might be an artefact of sampling
bias and that the ‘major extinction’ of dinosaurs across the
Jurassic—Cretaceous boundary [25,26,44,48,49] might be less
severe than previously thought (see also [45,46]).
