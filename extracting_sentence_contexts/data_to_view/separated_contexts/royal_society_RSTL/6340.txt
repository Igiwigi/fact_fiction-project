animals which will be consumed as human food. In the case of Pigs, a larger
ion of the total nitrogenous parts of the Offal will be consumed ; an amount

- indeed more than equivalent to that in the bones of the Carcass, supposed to be not con-
- zumed. It results in fact upon the whole, that there would appear to be a larger pro-
portion of the total nitrogen of the body of the Pig consumed, than of that of the other
animals. But, as has been seen in the Pig, the percentage in the body of that total
aitrogen is less, and the percentage of the fat greater than in the other cases. The Offal
parts enumerated as eaten, are of themselves associated with very little fat; 8 that,
meh food, which is chiefly used by the poorer classes, would be highly nitrogenous, if
aot combined with extraneous fatty matter.
