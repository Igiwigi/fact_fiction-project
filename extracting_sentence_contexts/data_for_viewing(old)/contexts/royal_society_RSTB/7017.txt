is solenostelic, (iii) that there has been a conspicuous development of pericyclic tissue,
(iv) that the vascular tissue of the secondary bud is confluent with the outer tissue of the
primary bud, and (v) that a second vascular cylinder is present within the solenostele of
the primary bud. Sections above the level of figure 74 show a gradual fading out of both
vascular cylinders as the damaged apical region is approached. Figures 75 and 76 illustrate
the structural organization at two successive levels below that of figure 74: the inner
cylinder first of all disappears, and then the outer cylinder diminishes as it becomes
incompletely conjoined with the shoot meristele. The maximum development of the inner
cylinder thus takes place in the immediate vicinity of the secondary bud.

The state of differentiation of the tissues of the outer and inner cylinder indicates
clearly that the latter is of later origin. Figures 99 and 100, plate 13, illustrate the structure
and mode of inception of the inner cylinder. It has, in fact, been developed from paren-
chymatous cells which initially constituted the medulla or pith of the solenostele of the
primary bud. Typical parenchymatous cells can still be seen in the centre of the inner
cylinder, but in the peripheral region of the pith growth and division of the parenchymatous
cells, mainly by tangential walls, have taken place and a cambium-like tissue has been formed
