excitability, which precedes the stage of paralysis and death. The immediate effects
of a complete and sudden cessation of the blood-flow in the brain are convulsions,
accelerated and deepened respiration, and vaso-motor spasm. The final eftect is total
paralysis and death.

Deoxygenation of the blood, as by asphyxia, provokes exactly the same sequence
of events. These facts prove the apparent universality of the law that whenever a
healthy neuro-muscular tissue is rendered anemic, a stage of hyper-excitability of
function precedes that of paralysis. It has, moreover, been determined that the
onset of these two stages is markedly delayed by cooling of the tissues, and this is so
both in mammals and in cold-blooded. animals.

Hucuurnes JAcKson since 1864 has drawn attention to the fact that convulsions
oceur from embolism of cortical arteries. He writes, in 1888,{ as follows :—* Com-
