This appearance has deceived some observers into the supposition that
such cells are ciliated, epithelial, self-motive bodies. They are not 80. I have
ventured to estimate this frequent fact as a direct demonstration of the theory advo-
cated by some physiologists, that the floating cells of the fluids secrete a self-coagu-
lating principle. But at the present stage of this inquiry the question admits of no
reply, whether the mode indicated is the only process by which fibrine is generated in
the living fluids? It is probably not 80.
