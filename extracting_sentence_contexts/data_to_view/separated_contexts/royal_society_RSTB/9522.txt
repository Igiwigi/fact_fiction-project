After adjusting for sire or dam effects
where appropriate, the calves produced by nuclear transfer
were approximately 20% heavier than those derived either
by mating or embryo transfer. More striking still, the variabil-
ity in birth weight of clones was 4-12 times greater than that
for the other groups [42]. In other words, the groups that
were expected to be very similar were in fact less uniform. The differences in weight had almost completely disappeared
by 1 year of age. Increases in birth weight were also observed
in several other experimental situations including embryo
culture in the presence of serum (as reviewed in [43]).
