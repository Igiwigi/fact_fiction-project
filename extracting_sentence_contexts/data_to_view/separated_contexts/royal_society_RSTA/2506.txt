This variation, though quite appreciable when we are dealing with large ranges, is
hardly worth considering in the case of the minimum ranges in Table XLVI. Examining that table we see that the winter months, especially December, are
conspicuous for small ranges. The fact that the mean values of R’ for winter months
fall conspicuously short of those for other seasons is due, not so much to the absence
of large values of R’,as to the presence of a considerable number of very small values. In summer, really small ranges are scarce. In fact, in the half year from April to
September no single day of the 11 years had a range under 5’.
