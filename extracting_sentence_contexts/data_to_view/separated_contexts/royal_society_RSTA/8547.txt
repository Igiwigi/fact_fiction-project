Summary of Conclusions.

(1) The ordinary hypothesis of rupture cannot be employed to predict the safe range
of alternating stress which can be applied to metal having a scratched surface. The
safe range of an unscratched test piece appears to be slightly less than the yield range,
but if the surface is scratched the safe range may be several times the range which
causes yield in the corners of the scratches.

(2) The “ theorem of minimum potential energy ” may be extended so as to be capable
of predicting the breaking loads of elastic solids, if account is taken of the increase of
surface energy which occurs during the formation of cracks.

(3) The breaking load of a thin plate of glass having in it a sufficiently long straight
crack normal to the applied stress, is inversely proportional to the square root of the
length of the crack. The maximum tensile stress in the corners of the crack is more
than ten times as great as the tensile strength of the material, as measured in an ordinary
test.

(4) The foregoing observation is in agreement with the known fact that the observed
strength of materials is less than one-tenth of the strength deduced indirectly from
physical data, on the assumption that the materials are isotropic. The observed
