The last term is not yet in this form and will require
the development of additional tools, which we do next.


(e) Derivative of the resolvent formula

To take derivatives of the twiddled expressions, we need to differentiate the resolvent R(z,s) =
(H(s) —z)71. By differentiating the identity (H(s) — z))R(z,s) =I we obtain

RG, s) = —R(z,s)H'(s)R(z,s). (4.22)

We will apply the derivative formula to our derivation. For example, using equation (4.2) we
obtain

~

1
= af (H —z)-'P'(H —z)"! dz, (4.23)

and hence taking the derivative results in
wy 1
P= x fut —2))[-H'(H —2z)7!P’ +P” — P'(H —z) 1 H'\(H —z) 1 dz. (4.24)

To bound this expression, we need to prove one more fact.

(f) Fact about a triple resolvent

We will need to analyse expressions of the form
F(A, B) = 4 fut —z)1A(H — z)~1B(H — z)~! dz, (4.25)
i

which we will use with A, B = H’ for the norm of P” and A, B = H’, P’ for the bound on P’~’ above. That is,
P’~' = —F(H’, P’) + P’"~ -F(P',H’). (4.26)

JRS proved a bound on F(A, B). Since F(A, B) has both diagonal and off-diagonal blocks, they
found the bound for each block.
