42 hE. J. SALISBURY ON THE CAUSES AND ECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF

frequency from one part of the leaf to another does not introduce any error into our
comparison ; moreover, in Scilla the question of variation according to the level at which
the leaves are borne does not arise. As, however, there is the possibility that sequence
of production, in other words the time at which the leaf is developed, might affect the
frequency, leaves comparable in this respect were as far as possible chosen from each
plant. It will be seen that, despite the fact that the one set of plants was grown in darkness
and the other in light, the conditions of humidity being the same, there is no significant
difference between the stomatal frequencies of the two sets. For the illuminated plants the
mean frequency, adding together the stomata on both faces, is 52-1, whereas for the non-
illuminated plants the mean frequency is 51-1; a difference of only a single unit and
the “standard error” of this difference is 1-16. If we consider the two surfaces
separately we again find the correspondence extremely close.
