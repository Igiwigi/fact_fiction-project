It should also be noted that the AMOC is correlated to the Arctic sea ice volume and area, as
it transports heat to the north and is driven by the North Atlantic Deep Water formation which,
in turn, influences or is influenced, respectively, by sea ice cover and growth rates [46,47]. When looking at the differences between the stochastic simulations and REF in the figure 7b
no large change in the AMOC can be observed for STOCH_UNCPL. This is probably due to the
fact that changes in sea ice thickness are mostly occurring in the central Arctic and are quite small
from year to year. The increase in AMOC in STOCH_CPL is presumably just a result of sampling
