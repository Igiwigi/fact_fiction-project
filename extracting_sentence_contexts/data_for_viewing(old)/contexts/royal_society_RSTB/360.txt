Ammoniacal nitrogen, not determined
Nitrous = = 892 parts per 100,000
Nitric a == 0 ;

The Ammoniacal Solution used in these experiments was found to contain on
November 21, 1889 :—
Ammoniacal nitrogen = 11°12 parts per 100,000.

From the above results it appears, therefore, that the pure growth had converted
more than one-half of the ammoniacal nitrogen into nitrous nitrogen in less than
five months, whilst no nitric nitrogen had been formed. The impure growths contained
in the 22nd and 23rd generations had also only given rise to nitrous without any
nitric nitrogen, even in the course of ten and a half months. In fact, in the case of the
22nd generation, the whole of the ammonia had been almost quantitatively converted
into nitrous nitrogen.

That in the case of “ Bottle No. 1 (2nd generation),” the sum of the ammoniacal
and nitrous nitrogen is in slight excess of the ammoniacal nitrogen present in ihe
original solution employed is probably due to the bottle in which this 2nd generation
had undergone nitrification having been considerably larger than the others, and
consequently more concentration by evaporation through the cotton-wool stopper
must doubtless have taken place.

In order to put this point to the test, we, later on (February 15, 1890), again took
a similar large bottle, in fact, a duplicate of No. 1 above, and found
