65536 different intensity levels. This fact helps in detecting air bubbles and PVC particles of
0.1mm and correspondingly low phase fractions in the bubble column. Projection data were collected for two different X-ray energies: 60 and 200 keV. The attenuation
property of an object is significantly different for these two energy regions which help in
calculating the three phases separately.
