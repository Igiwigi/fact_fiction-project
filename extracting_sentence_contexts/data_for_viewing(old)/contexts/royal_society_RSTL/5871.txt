In my references to the views of preceding writers regarding the anatomy and phy-
ology of the Spongiade, I shall endeavour to correct the errors, rather than to point
Sut the authors of them, feeling satisfied that posterity will care as little about the petty
= discussions concerning the facts and opinions of the present period as we do about
Sthose of our ancestors; at the same time I shall endeavour to do justice to the industry
and research of preceding naturalists, whose errors of omission are entitled to every
possible excuse, when we remember the difficulties they laboured under in the course of
eir investigations, for want of competent microscopic powers with which to work out
She organization of the minute and delicate objects of their research, while we are in
"Zull possession of all the advantages of the modern improvements of the microscope,
Spiving a pleasure and facility to our investigations that must have been comparatively
Zlmost unknown to our predecess0rs.
