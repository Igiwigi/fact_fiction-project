although the electrodes are certainly colder than the flame gases. If we regard a
molecule of the salt as consisting of oppositely-charged ions or electrons held together
by the attractions between their charges, then, when the molecule is very near to a
conductor like the electrode in the flame, the induced charges on the conductor
diminish the attraction between the ions composing the molecule which may enable
it to be ionised, even while the molecules not near the electrodes are quite stable,
though at a higher temperature.

(5.) The Relative Velocities of the Ions in the Flame.

The way in which the current through the flame depends on the temperature of
the negative electrode indicates that the part played by the negative ions in carrying
the current is more important than that played by the positive ions. This fact, and
the results obtained in investigating the fall of potential between the electrodes,
suggested the idea that the velocity of the negative ions, due to a given potential
gradient, is much larger than the corresponding velocity of the positive ions.

To test this, experiments were made in which the potential difference between the
upper and lower electrodes necessary to cause the positive or negative ions to move
down the flame against the upward stream of gases was determined. The apparatus
used for this purpose is shown in fig. 4.
