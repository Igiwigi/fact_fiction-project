There remain only two of STENsIoâ€™s comparisons. (10) The non-articulation of the palato-quadrate with the ethmoidal region. Even
if true this fact would provide no evidence of Elasmobranch affinities; the palato-
quadrates of Acanthodians always end in a free anterior border which lies behind the
ethmoidal region. (1) The general shape of the neuro-cranium with its widened ventral surface was
by far the most Elasmobranch-like of all the structures of the fish. This resemblance
becomes much less striking when critically considered.
