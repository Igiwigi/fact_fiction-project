This disturbance has no material effect upon the performance of the machine. But
the current in the armature also distorts the arrangement of the comparatively weak
field in the gap between the pole-pieces, displacing the point of zero field in the
direction of rotation in a generator and opposite to. the direction. of rotation in. a
motor ; and it, is, due to this that the non-sparking point for the brushes is displaced.,
A satisfactory mathematical analysis of the: displacement of the field in the gap
between the pole-pieces by the: current in the armature would be more troublesome
than an @ priort analysis of the distribution of field in this space when the magnet
current is the only magnetising force. Owing to the fact that the armature is divided
into a finite number of sections there is a rapid diminution of the displacement of the
field during the time that a section is being commutated, the diminution. being
