virus and other viral encephalitides. Their medical importance is reflected by
the fact that they were among the first wave of genomes to be sequenced,
An. gambiae in 2002 [2], Ae. aegypti in 2007 [3] and C. quinquifasciatus in 2010
[4]. This has revealed an extensive repertoire of P450s (more than 100) allowing
the development of new tools for investigating the functional role of mosquito
P450s and their relationships with insecticide metabolism. The fight against diseases spread by mosquitoes has enormous environ-
mental, economic and social consequences.
