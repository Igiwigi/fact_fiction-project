phase throughout, and any number of perfectly conducting bodies be introduced,
their currents will be in the same phase as the primary field, and no couple will
be produced. ;

It has been stated that in the case of Professor Extau Txomson’s sphere, spinning
on a sheet of copper, the effect was due to the sheet acting asa “ shield” and pro-
ducing an unsymmetrical field. That this explanation is not satisfactory will be
evident on considering that the field is unsymmetrical before the sheet is interposed,
and that the better the sheet conducts the better the shielding effect ; so that if it
be a perfect conductor a large couple would be expected whereas in reality there is
none whatever.

The effect must, I think, be traced to the fact that the currents induced in the
sheet are caused by self-induction to lag, so that the field in action on the sphere
does not alternate in one phase.

The results obtained in the preceding analysis are applied to the case of two thi
spherical shells in the presence of an alternating current in a straight infinite wire.
