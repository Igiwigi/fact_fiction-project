Perhaps the most difficult problem of the boundary state is presented by the fact that
c is positive for the normal reaction and negative for the tangential reaction. The
external force which calls forth the tangential reaction may be taken to be applied as

a traction on the surfaces « and 8, and an increase in the length of molecules whose
long axis was normal to those surfaces would increase the moment of the force at the
surface of slip h/2. But the S$ value relates to a traction and cis positive for this value.

The fact that ¢ is positive for the normal reaction may mean that, whilst a surface
of slip is plane and lies between the ends of molecules, a surface of break is not plane
because the molecules are pulled apart like teeth out of their sockets, one half of the
number moving one way and the other half moving the opposite way (cf. p. 15).

6. Conelusions.*—The upshot of the discussion and especially of the sections on the
Leslie pressure and the mean value rule may be set down as follows.

The most promising view of the Boundary State IN LIQUIDS is that it is due to
the formation of chains of highly polarised molecules stretching through the lubricant
from one enclosing solid to the other.

Hach chain has little strength in shear, great strength in tension and in both the
