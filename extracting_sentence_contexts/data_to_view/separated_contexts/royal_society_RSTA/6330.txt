In particular, the significant point here is not that ordered flows are
permitted to exist as long as they produce enough entropy to compensate for their internal
entropy reduction. It is that with selection of macro from micro (spontaneous ordering) to occur
the rate of entropy production must always go up. In fact, in more illuminating terms, the more order
produced the greater the rate of entropy production is going to be. Figure 6 shows the dramatic increase in the rate of entropy production (as heat transport from
source to sink) occurring in the transition from disorder to order in a simple experiment similar
to the BC in figure 4 further highlighting what we saw in detail above during the production of
ACK. It is path selection by rate, and with this the answer to the core question ‘why the world is
in the order production business’ is virtually proclaiming itself [4].

The previous sections take us directly to the physical selection principle that accounts for
spontaneous ordering.
