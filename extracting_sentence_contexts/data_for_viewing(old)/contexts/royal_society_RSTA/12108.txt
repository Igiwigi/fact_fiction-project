were therefore impossible.

Before proceeding to discuss these results further, it may be well to ask whet
the large changes in specific conductivity affect the black films only, or whet
similar phenomena can be detected when the thickness is greater. On this point
have made numerous observations, which have led us to the following conclusion :

Proposition IX.—The specific conductivity of a soap film increases as the thi
decreases, but this increase is less in the case of a film formed of a solutio
which a salt has been added, and cannot be detected in the case of a “lig
glycérique” such as that we have employed.

To justify this statement we adduce the following facts which are only sample
the results of a large number of experiments. Perhaps the most convenient wai
testing the constancy of the specific conductivity of a film is to calculate the
from observations on the electrical resistance, assuming that the specific resistant
the same as that of the liquid in mass, and to compare the number so obtained |
the thickness given by a direct optical measurement based on the colour.
ratio of the electrical thickness to the optical thickness is unity there is no
suspect a change in the specific conductivity. If it differs much from unity
presumption is in favour of such a change. One film, formed of a solution contall
