Discussion has been ongoing in the social sciences in
this area [38-40]. In part, this is a consequence of the statistical analysis tools for observational
data not having caught up with the large volumes of such data that are now routinely collected,
as well as publication biases. Schuemie et al. [9] explore, using a version of meta-analysis, finding
the appropriate way of combining multiple observational studies, and coping with the fact that
the empirical distribution of p-values is nothing like the analytic null models we are used to
applying. Much is needed in the way of new mathematical theories and statistical methodologies
to handle scenarios such as these, and it seems that many lessons can be gleaned from considering
the challenges faced by observational studies in human health and in the social sciences.

Accountability of algorithmic decision-making is a popular topic of investigation.
