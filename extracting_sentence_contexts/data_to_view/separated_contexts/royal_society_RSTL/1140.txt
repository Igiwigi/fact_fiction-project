These
great specific gravities seem surprising, because that of tin is
only about 7,2, and of copper ingot about 8,420, F 6. p. 422. But of all metallic combinations that of copper with tin produces
perhaps the greatest increase of density. ARISTOTLE made
this observation long ago,* and the fact is ſamiliarly known to 1
manufacturers of bell-metal. But it does not appear that the
increase of speciſic gravity is 80 great as it is stated by GLAUBER. 2
According to him, if two balls of copper and two balls of tin
of the same dimensions be melted together, the compound will
afford scarcely three balls of the same dimensions as each of
the four balls ; and yet the three balls will weigh as much as
the four balls —* Funde predictos globulos in unum ... ...
