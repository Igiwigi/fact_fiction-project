Not only was the copper preserved on both s:des

in the same manner as in the other experiments, but even the
iron ; and after a fortnight, both the polish of the copper and
the iron remained unimpaired. 7. I am continuing these researches, and I shall communi-
cate such of them as are connected with new facts, to the
Royal Society. The Lords Commissioners 'of the Admiralty, with their
usual zeal for promoting the interests of the Navy by the
application of science, have given me permission to ascertain
the practical value of these results by experiments upon ships
of war; and there seems every reason - to expect ( unless
causes Should interfere of which our present knowledge
gives no indications) that small quantities of zinc, or which
is much cheaper, of malleable or cast iron, placed in contact
with the copper sheeting of ships, which is all in electrical
connection, will entirely prevent its corrosion. And as ne-
gative electricity cannot be supposed favourable to animal
or vegetable life; and as it occasions the deposition of mag-
nesia, a substance exceedingly noxious to land vegetables,
upon the copper surface ; and as it must assist in preserving
its polish, there 'is considerable ground for hoping that the
8ame application will keep the bottoms of ships clean, a cir-
cumstance of great importance both in trade and naval war.
