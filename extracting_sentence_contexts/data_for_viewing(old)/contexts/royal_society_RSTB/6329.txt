Reproductive cycle—The sexual breeding season at Plymouth lasts for not more
than six weeks, but may commence at any time from early July to mid-September,
depending on the average temperature of the preceding months. The period of
formation and isolation of buds immediately follows the sexual breeding season,
while during the greater part of the winter and early spring the buds are reorganized
into new zooids that become active usually in April or May. Thus spring is a period
of growth, summer one of maturation and sexual activity, autumn and early winter
of asexual reproduction, winter of bud development, and the whole cycle is
associated very definitely with the seasonal environmental changes.

Formation of buds—Closely following upon the breeding season, the thoracic parts
of each zooid undergo regression. The siphons close, the thorax as a whole con-
denses and there is considerable autolysis. In fact, the whole of the thorax anterior
to the oesophagus eventually disappears, although certain cells accumulate reserve
substances during the period of autolysis and migrate posteriorly. There is thus
a storage of the anterior part of the zooid in the form of trophocytes in the posterior
part. During and subsequent to this posterior migration of trophocytes a series
of transverse constrictions appear in the region of the oesophagus of each zooid.
The constrictions appear first at the anterior end so that there is a definite antero-
posterior time-lag. In the region of the stomach the zooids are apparently too
bulky for successful constriction and the final appearance is that of a string of beads
representing the oesophagus and a single mass the stomach region of the zooid.

The constrictions themselves are the result of epidermal activity alone. The
tissues and organs internal to the epidermis remain passive and are cut through
