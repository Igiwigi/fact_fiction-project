‘upward’ and ‘downward’ ordinal patterns and ordinal patterns describing monotone
changes. There are moreover symmetries in the ordinal pattern distributions related to
time and data range reversal. Both can be exploited when considering special order-
related aspects of data analysis; for example, for describing roughness by change statistics
[86] and for quantifying the phenomenon of heart rate asymmetry [40] described above.


3. Finding convenient generating partitions in dynamical systems is an unsolvable problem
in many cases. However, as noted above, the KS entropy can be approximated on the base
of ordinal partitions for sufficiently large pattern length L. This is important at least from
a conceptual view point, but in practice L can be too large to estimate the KS entropy
accurately. Nevertheless, ordinal analysis with a small L is useful in descriptive data
analysis. The fact that conditional variants of permutation entropy seem better estimators
of the KS entropy than the original concepts is certainly worth further research [70].

4. As permutations, ordinal L-patterns are elements of the symmetric group of degree L.
This additional algebraic structure of the symbols allows applications to the analysis of
coupled dynamics [80,81].

Ordinal symbolic analysis is a relatively new field and many methods are not consolidated yet.
Future research should particularly focus on the development of statistical models and methods
aimed at showing the significance and reliability of the results obtained by ordinal analysis.
There is moreover some need for systematic studies comparing different complexity and coupling
measures, on both the ordinal and metric level.
