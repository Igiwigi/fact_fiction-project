The neurocord resembles the neural tube in having a lumen or residual lacunae,
bounded by epithelial cells resembling periventricular ependymal cells, amongst which
are gland cells like those in the neural tube of lampreys, sharks and teleosts (Kappers 1929). In view of the other evidence placing the Enteropneusta in the phylum Chordata, the
neurocord is very probably homologous with the neural tube, and its presence as a mere
conducting tract suggests that the Enteropneusta are degenerate. The fact that large
unipolar ganglion cells are almost entirely confined to it, and to the dorsal nerve cord
immediately behind the collar, indicates that this region was once a nerve centre, but now
the nervous system is diffuse, with no centres. It seems a reasonable hypothesis that the Enteropneusta arose from some group of more
generalized chordates, that possessed a ciliated larva with three pairs of coelomic pouches
and the rudiments ofa notochord and neural tube. After closure of the latter in the middle
somite its further development was arrested.
