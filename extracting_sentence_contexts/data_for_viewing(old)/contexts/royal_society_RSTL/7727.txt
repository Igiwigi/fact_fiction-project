I think that the illustrions French astronomer, who has otherwise done me 8uch ample justice, will not object
to my pointing out this slight inaccuracy, due entirely to the fact that the firss communication of my discovery

another line. As at firs caught it was very long; and by moving the telescope very
slightly backwards and forwards in right ascension, in one direction the line shortened
and brightened, and was visible on the solar spectrum for 80me distance, in another
direction it became disconnected with the spectrum altogether. TI was hence able to
determine roughly the shape and dimensions of the prominence.
