First, there is no
evidence of any mixed pith in the perimedullary “steles” ; secondly, there is
evidence in favour of the view that they were formed subsequently to the outer
wood sectors; thirdly, there is a marked variability in different parts of the same
stem (J?. tetrapteridoides); and fourthly, there is a very close resemblance in
structural features, e.g., the centripetal “ partial steles” (Plate 6, 13, d’, d’) and the
adventitious strands, w, are very much alike. If we assume that Mheworylon is
a case of parallel evolution of liane stem structure, then other facts support the
hypothesis that the perimedullary “steles” are entirely secondary structures. As
already mentioned, in Wilbrandia, meristems arising in the perimedullary region do
give rise to secondary xylem. CuHopar* also describes adventitious vascular strands
in the perimedullary region of Dowantha (Bignonia) unguis.
