To
apply this to the case of a solid solute the specific volume v, of the liquefied solute
as it exists in the solution must be deduced by the help of the data above-mentioned. It will be shown later that for NaCl solutions the value of Ev, (a gramme molecule
of the liquefied solute) at 20° C, may be taken as 25'053 c.c. If wy is the mean specific volume of all the water in the solution, both free and
combined, then

(E+H)v = Ev +Hwy,
Huy = Hw+E (w—v,)—(E+H) (wv),

and therefore

and since
x = (E+H)(w—v) and x, = E (w—~),
we have
H (w—wy) = x-Xo

or writing w—wy = Awy, the change in the mean specific volume of the water, we

have
Awy = Ax/H,

which also obviously follows from the mere fact that we treat Ev, as a constant,
considering the whole contraction on dilution as due to changes in the density of the
water. Either of the quantities Awy or Ay,/H is the contraction per gramme (or the
specific contraction) of the water of the solution. 18.
