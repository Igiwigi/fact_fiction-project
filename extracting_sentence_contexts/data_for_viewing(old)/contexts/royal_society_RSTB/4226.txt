but a direct method would be more satisfactory. i

Re-sowing was thus inevitable, in order to keep the spatial factor uniform in all
sowings. On the other hand, such re-sown plants should not be included in the
experiment, if any fair comparison between plants of various ages was desired.
Lastly, since re-sowing is always practised in field-crop conditions, it was necessary to
include re-sown plants in any discussion of the technical bearings of the experiment.

We ultimately decided to re-sow in the usual way, but to pick out the groups for
observation so as to include none but the original sowings. The state of the re-sown
plants was not directly recorded, but could be determined by comparison with the
condition of the later-sown plots, to which they corresponded in age. In point of
fact, it was not possible to exclude re-sown plants entirely from the observation rows
of the earliest sowing, unless by breaking up the rows into fragments inconveniently
small, the observation of which would be subject to error through confusing the
staff of plant observers. The observed plants of this sowing actually included about
7 per cent. of re-sowns, but it will be seen later that their presence tended merely to
diminish the distinctive inferiority of this particular sowing, without otherwise
altering it.

With this trifling exception, the investigation is then restricted solely to plants of
detinite age, all grown at the same spacing.

Irrigation.â€”A large number of varied considerations had to be taken into account
in working out the arrangement of this factor.
