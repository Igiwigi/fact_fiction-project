of barium sulphate injections, to find an entry of any of the deeper and large branches of
the “ fine ’ vessel system into the lymphatic trunks or sinuses. These negative results,
taken in conjunction with the fact that injection of the “ fine ”’ vessels, when not pushed
to extremes, or when a finely granular mass is used, does not penetrate into the larger
lymphatics, whereas a more perfect injection with a fluid mass fills the peripheral
lymphatics more completely than it does the larger trunks and sinuses, and also the
fact that in a very complete indian-ink injection of the abdominal trunks of the lymphatic
system (Plate 3, fig. 13) none of the mass penetrated into the “ fine ” vessels, make it, I
think, safe to assume that any connection there may be between the two systems other
than through the valved connectives in the mucous membrane must take place
peripherally through their finer branches or ultimate capillary networks.

I have, in fact, seen in the skin and branchiostegal membrane a very few delicate
open connectives (fig. 19), not valved like those in the mucous membrane, but far too

few to account for the comparatively large amount of injection mass that can be intro-
duced from the “ fine” vessels into the lymphatics. The comparative freedom with
which the lymphatics of the branchiostegal membranes and pelvic fins fill by injection
of the * fine” vessels suggests that possibly there may be means of connection here
