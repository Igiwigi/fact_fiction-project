Is these papers I endeavour, to the utmost of my power, to
distinguish between the facts which I am able to substantiate, *
and the hypothesis by which I have: been. directed in my
inquiries. I hope that the importance of the facts may give
some bias in favour of that mode of reasoning by which they
have been discovered, and an additional interest to anatomical
studies. In my endeavour to arrange the nerves of the orbit, I
encounter, in the first step, all the difficulties of my subject ;
for although there be only nine nerves properly enumerated
as proceeding from the brain, six of these go to the eye ; the
second, third, fourth, part of the fifth, sixth, and seventh,
go into the orbit, and may be said to be concentrated into a
space no larger than a nut-shell. In this investigation it is not always possible to give de-
monstrative evidence, or to answer opposition by cutting
across a nerve ; here we must proceed on a minute investi-
gation of the anatomy, and by reasoning, rather than by ex-
periment : yet I $shall demonstrate what was stated hypo-
thetically, in a former paper, that there is a correspondence
between the compound functions of an organ, and the nerves
transmitted to it.
