a child just born 98.5; after twelve hours 99, and after three
days, the same; during the whole of which time it appeared
in perfect health. On five other children of the same age,
similar observations were made. In two instances of weak
infants, the temperature, one hour after birth, was found not
to exceed 96, which is two degrees below the standard heat
of man in a state of health ; but their respiration was till lan-
guid, and the next day the heat of the axilla had risen in one
to 98.5, and in the other to gg.*

To conclude, as in each hypothesis examined, difficulties
are found to exist from facts or the results of experiments of
an unbending nature, we must at present either suspend theory
altogether and search- for experimenta. crucis, or adopt that
hypothesis which is conformable to the greater number of facts.
The first measure is certainly most philosophical ; but to the
latter we are naturally most inclined, and if I were questioned
which view is preferable, I should make; no. hesitation in se-
lecting Dr. BLack's, which to. me appears. both. most. simple
and most satisfactory.
