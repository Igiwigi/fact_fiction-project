* We pointed out earlier that any quadrie which contains a line 4 of the surface I touches that surface at
three points of 2; and if then we make it touch I at a fourth point of 4, it will do so at every point of
the line.

papers entirely to this transformation* which is, in fact, the only one worked out by him
for four dimensions. It is associated from our point of view with the net of lines of the
plane w as we remarked above. But from the analytical point of view it is as simple as
could be.
