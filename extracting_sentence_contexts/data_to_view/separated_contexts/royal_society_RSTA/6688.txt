The length of the explosion
tube was 12ft., and the distance from the centre of the pressure bar to the closed end of the
tube was 16in. The record is similar to that shown in figure 29, the main difference being
in the length of the intercept on the horizontal axis of the straight line of closest fit drawn
through the observed points; in this case the length of the intercept corresponds to about
8 usec., compared with about 4-6 usec. in the previous case. This difference is due to the fact
that the force on the pressure end of the bar does not rise instantaneously to its final value,
since the detonation wave takes a finite time to travel across the face of the bar when the
static pressure is being measured; since the velocity of the detonation wave in a mixture of

equal volumes of oxygen and acetylene is 2-96 x 10°cm./sec., the time taken by the force
on the face of the bar to rise to its constant value is 2-54/2-96 x 10°sec. = 8-6 usec. Figure 31 gives the (3, X— X,) curve derived from a plate taken under the same conditions
as figure 30, except that the diameter of the pressure bar in this experiment was 0-5in., and
its length was 2 ft. 3 in., so that the time taken by the detonation wave to traverse the diameter
of the bar was 4:3 usec. Comparison of this diagram with the preceding one shows, as one

f would expect, that if the length of the bar is the same the errors decrease as the radius of
the bar decreases.
