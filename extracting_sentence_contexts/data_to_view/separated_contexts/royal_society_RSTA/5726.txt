We expect that near future studies will use numerical and experimental data now available [83]
to perform the required validation comparisons.

(c) Numerical implementation

The spectral model calculations of LWN presented in this paper were performed with a code
using a second-order MacCormack scheme [84] for time integration. The code uses an exponential
grid for the wavenumber k =k; exp{z/zs;}, where k; and z; are scale factors and assumed to
be equal to unity [1]. The variables computed are, in fact kRyn, kRij, ka; and kb. This choice
of variables results in the cascade terms retaining a conservation form when expressed in
terms of z rather than k. Likewise, the values of the integrals of the spectral quantities are
easily determined, e.g.
