The epithelium and subepithelial plexus of the circumoral ring is continuous peri-
pherally and interradially with the general ectoderm of the disk, and radially with the
radial nerve cord. Centrally, the fibrillar substance of the ring is continuous with
that of the buccal membrane (fig. 20, bucc. memb.).

The histology of the circumoral nerve ring differs but little from that of the radial
cord. The cuticle, epithelial cell layer—composed of supporting cells with their
attendant fibres—glandular elements, sensory cells, and association ganglion elements
are all present, but the main mass of the ring consists of compacted fibrillae. Any
differences in the composition of the nerve ring, as compared with the radial cord,
are concerned with the ganglion cells and the neurofibrillae. There appear to be
fewer multipolar ganglion cells at the base of the nuclear zone, a circumstance
difficult to account for in view of the fact that sensory elements are present in almost

the same numbers as in the radial nerve cord. Bipolar ganglion cells, on the other
hand, are present in larger numbers than in the radial cord and are particularly
numerous in the deeper parts of the ring, in the neighbourhood of the connective
tissue layer. They are elongate, spindle-shaped cells, 10-36 » in length (most
commonly about 15 2), and of 3-5-4 u greatest diameter. The rounded vesicular
nucleus is of the usual type.
