Classical explanations for why niche breadths and range
sizes vary with latitude often (over-)rely on underlying gradi-
ents in selection that vary between the equator and the poles,
and which are presumed to differentially select for general-
ism or specialism along them. However, such hypotheses
rest on assumptions that populations are in equilibrium
with their environments. The recent, dramatic and accelerat-
ing reorganization of biodiversity in the Anthropocene has
highlighted that many if not most populations and species
are in fact not in equilibrium states, opening the door to the
proposition of alternative eco-evolutionary mechanisms of
niche evolution that do not rely so heavily on adaptive expla-
nations for meaningful biological patterns. Spatial evolutionary processes, such as spatial sorting of
dispersal and colonization syndromes, release from selection,
spatial demographic expansion, directional gene flow and

spatial asymmetries in drift, have increasingly been recog-
nized for their special contribution to evolution at range
edges. Even within static ranges, powerful non-equilibrium
evolutionary processes may be ongoing [70], and are poten-
tially not often enough invoked to explain major patterns of
niche evolution and limitation.
