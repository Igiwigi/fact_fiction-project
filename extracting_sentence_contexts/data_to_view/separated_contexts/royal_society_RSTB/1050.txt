On the other side, the ova were
S only commencing to issue from the mouth of the oviduct, and had not yet given off the
i first polar body. These, which were carefully observed under the same conditions as
=the ova on the other side, soon gave off the first polar body quite normally, and
E formed a vitelline membrane, but proceeded no further. 5 From these facts we may, I think, conclude firstly, that the entrance of the
"8 spermatozoon takes place after and independently of the formation of the first polar
E body, but before the formation of the second ; secondly, that fertilization probably
2 takes place in the mantle-cavity outside the oviduct ; and thirdly, that the formation
Zot the vitelline membrane is associated with the origin of the first polar body, and
8 S quite independent of the act of fertilization. This fact gains in interest when it is
S = understood that a similar membrane is also probably associated with the formation of
& the second peter, body in the case of Peltogaster, the early development of which I
4 hope to give in a future communication.
