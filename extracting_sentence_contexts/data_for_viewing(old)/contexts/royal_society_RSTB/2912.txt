differs, however, from the last named in not having any powerful paralysing action
on the heart, for I found that even a solution of the strength of 1 in 50 produced
no effect on the beat of a frog’s heart to which it was directly applied, while
Martin (4) found Pseudechis venom to stop the frog’s heart in diastole when applied
in strong solution.

As Lamp(5) has shown that Daboia venom in a weak solution is completely
destroyed by a temperature of 73-75° C. for } hour, while Cobra venom is little if
at all affected by such treatment, I treated some Bungarus fasciatus venom in this
way, and in Experiment VI. injected a cat under chloroform intravenously with the
same dose as in the previous cases (10 mg. per kilogramme), but at the end of
1 hour it had produced no effect on either the blood pressure or the respiratory rate.
This fact is of considerable interest, for the main action of the venom is undoubtedly
of the Colubrine type causing paralysis of respiration, and the symptoms produced
on birds, rats and mice are precisely similar to those of Cobra venom itself, yet the
poison is rendered inert by heating to 73-75° C., and in the case of mice twenty
times a minimal lethal dose thus heated proved harmless. It is evident then that
Lamp and Hanwa’s(5) contention that Daboia venom contains no element of the
Colubrine type is not proved by his experiments showing an absolute loss of
virulence by heating to 78-75° C., for there might be such an element present
which is destroyed by that temperature; as in the case of the Banded Krait
venom.
