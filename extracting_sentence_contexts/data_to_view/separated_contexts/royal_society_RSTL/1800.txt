Considering the passage for the voice as one irregular cavity, extending
from the glottis to the lips and nostrils, we shall find it subject to great
changes, and powerful in its influence on the voice. For although the breath
is vocalized by the larynx, both the musical notes in singing and the vowels
in speech, are affected by the form and dimensions of this cavity. Notwithstanding the ingenuity displayed in experiments on animals, to show
that their cries proceed from the larynx, we have no authority to disregard the
fact, that when a person who has divided the pharynx, and exposed the top of
the windpipe, attempts to speak, no sound issues from the larynx. By great
effort he may produce a noise; but anything like the common effort of speak-
ing is attended with no audible sounds. From this we must infer that the de-
licate vibrations, necessary to articulate language, are influenced not merely
by the action in the glottis, but by the condition of the walls of the pharynx ;
the cavity into which the sound is thrown.
