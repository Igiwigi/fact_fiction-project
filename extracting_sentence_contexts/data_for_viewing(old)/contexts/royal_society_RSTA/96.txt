provided that a compensating transformation is applied to the electromagnetic potentials.

This idea of replacing a global by a local symmetry, often called the ‘gauge principle’, provides
a sort of rationale for the existence of the electromagnetic field; without that field, the extension is
not possible. Moreover, it was also seen as offering an explanation for the fact that the quantum
of the electromagnetic field, the photon, is massless, in the sense of having zero rest-mass; in
vacuum it cannot ever be at rest, and its minimum energy is zero. This is because the gauge
principle does not work if we add a mass term. That yields a theory that cannot be renormalized,
so it is inconsistent in the sense of giving infinite answers to physical questions.

It seemed natural to ask if this gauge principle could be extended. Salam was convinced from
an early stage that a unified theory of all interactions should be a gauge theory. The first proposal
of this kind was made by Yang & Mills [8] in 1954 and in fact independently in the same year by
Ronald Shaw, then a student of Salam’s, though he never published it except as a PhD thesis [9].
This Yang-Mills theory was based on applying the gauge principle to the isospin SU(2) group, and
was intended as a theory of strong interactions. But the fact that isospin is not an exact symmetry
posed a problem, because adding symmetry-breaking terms seemed to destroy the nice properties
of gauge theories. In the end, it did not turn out to be the correct theory of strong interactions; that
is a quite different gauge theory called quantum chromodynamntics (QCD), which I will not discuss in
detail here. However, the Yang-Mills theory is the basis on which all subsequent gauge theories
have been founded.

Because of the difficulty, mentioned earlier, of calculating with a strongly interacting theory,
interest began at least to some extent to shift towards the weak interactions, especially after the
