it cannot be thrown into the form equivalent to (4:5).

It is immediately obvious that the algebra is going to be considerably heavier, and that
difficulties arise because the successful use of the method in general terms requires the

algebraic evaluation of integrals of the type J ey where â€”1<A<1 and f involves the

dependent variable 4,. The possible forms for fare thus drastically restricted to quadratics
in 7 or sin $77, and even these lead to integrals which change with the numerical value of
A, from inverse trigonometric to inverse hyperbolic form and therefore require careful
interpretation. The fact that, in any particular case, it might be comparatively simple to
evaluate them numerically is here irrelevant, since we are only concerned at the moment
with algebraic treatment. Moreover, the restriction to simple forms for f necessarily means
that fewer boundary conditions will be satisfied and the accuracy of the solution suffers in
consequence. Since 4 is always less than unity it is permissible to expand the denominator
of the integrand and integrate term by term, but for high Mach numbers the resulting series
is only slowly convergent, and in any case this process is equivalent to assuming that f is a
polynomial in 4,. The discussion of (4-5) shows that this would lead to the analogues of h(A)

and g(A) involving high powers of A,, and the discovery of the relevant roots of the latter,

an essential preliminary to further developments, might be quite difficult. A further point
to be noticed is that even supposing the integrals have been evaluated, one is still confronted
