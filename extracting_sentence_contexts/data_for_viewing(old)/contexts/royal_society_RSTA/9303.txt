molecular mass or radius) is from the minimum value of (4,—1)’ eff, which is clearly
zero (when », = 0 and », = 0, @.e., when the heavier molecules are infinitesimal in
number and the lighter molecules are infinitesimal in mass) to the maximum value of
(k,—1)° b/e, which is yy (when », = 0 and », # 0). The maximum value of (4,—1)? a/d
is z$y, Which lies between the above limits. The corresponding range of (1—«,)~}, the
correction factor to the first approximation (13°06) to D,., which is introduced on
making a second approximation, is consequently from 1 to 1°083. Hence, in con-
junction with § 13 (e), we may conclude that for rigid elastic spherical molecules the
total possible range in the complete correction factor V’/V to the first approximation
to Dy, (¢f (13°01)) is from 1 to ae or 1°182 (ef. (13°14)).

It would not be difficult to construct a table showing the values of (1—«,)~ for
various typical pairs of gases, but owing to the fact that there are three variables
concerned (i.e., m,/m, a,/o2, and v,/v,) it would need to be somewhat complicated, and

probably little more knowledge would be gained from it than may be deduced from
the above discussion and from Table IV. of § 13 (7).

(i) Variation of Dy, with v.11. Comparison with Experiment.

In view of the conflicting theories regarding the relation between D,, and »,/v,
several, series of experiments to test the question were made at Halle during the years
