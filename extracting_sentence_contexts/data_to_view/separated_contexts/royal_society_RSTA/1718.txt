For the case in which K —1 is small this conclusion is given by G. W. WALKER, ‘Quarterly Journal
of Mathematics,’ vol. 30, 1899, p. 217. The formule given on that page agree with (5-6), when K — 1 is
small; but the more general formule on the preceding page do not agree with (5-6) completely. I have
not succeeded in tracing the discrepancy on account of the fact that G. W. WALKER has omitted some of
the details of his preliminary calculations. + E. T. Panis, ‘Phil. Mag.,’ vol. 30 (Ser. 6), 1915, p. 459.
