The stomata on the leaves
resemble those on the cupules in all these characters, and the slight variations seen in
the different species of the Corystospermacee seem to have their counterparts in the
different species of the leaves which have been examined. It seems probable that when
all the forms of leaves have been examined we shall be able to match at least a number
of them with species of Umkomasia, etc., by comparison of the details of their stomata
and epidermal cells. In view of all these facts it appears highly probable that the plants which bore the
fertile structures of the corystospermous types also produced leaves of the type of
Diecroidium, “ Stenopteris,” Johnstonia or perhaps of the forked Pachypteris, the cuticles
of which have not yet been so carefully examined ; it is very much more probable
that these leaves belonged to pteridospermous types than to plants of filicinean affinities. Famity PELTASPERMACE. This name is proposed for the plants whose characteristic fronds were designated
Lepidopteris by Scutmerr.
