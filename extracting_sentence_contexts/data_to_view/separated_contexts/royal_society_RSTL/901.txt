But here we certainly do, nothing more, than interpose among
the red globules a numberof the less dense particles of serum:;
which, in their present situation, act as opake matter, and con-
sequently increase the internal reflections. A second example
occurs, when we view, by transmitted light, the fine edges and
angles of a piece of crassamentum in water; for, in this si-
tuation, their colour appears to be a bright scarlet, though all
the other parts of the sxame mass are black. These facts seem
sufficient to prove, that the immediate cause I have assigned
for the production of the florid appearance in blood, which has
been exposed to the action of common air and neutral salts, is
adequate to the effect; but I shall advance a step further, and
shew how the Modena red is converted into a scarlet. Blood, as I have found by experiment, is one of those fluids
which Sir Isaac NewTox has observed appear yellow, * if
viewed in very thin masses. When, therefore, a number of
opake particles.
