Historically, this concern has been couched in the form of worries about the ‘acausal’ nature
of quantum mechanics, because before the great success of quantum mechanics in providing
explanations of atomic-level phenomena, causal explanations had been generally required and


are still preferred for all physical phenomena. Indeed, Schwinger considers quantum mechanics a
(statistically) causal theory, even though one lacking underlying ‘hidden variables’, because it is a
theory of ensembles not of individuals. No grounding for the physical state change accompanying
definite measurement outcomes, beyond its being necessitated by their existence as brute matters
of fact which remain problematic in the absence of such a successor theory or a special assumption
absolving the theory of responsibility for providing a detailed dynamics of measurement, is
offered by Schwinger. Grounding the existence of these only statistically governed individual outcomes in an
independent fundamental principle, rather than merely assuming them to be randomly occurring
in the statistical sense, would be a significant development in justifying its otherwise obvious
explanatory power. This is the primary motivation here for looking to the plenitude principle
(suitable formulated) as such a ground that differs from those offered by Bohr (complementarity) :
and Heisenberg (actualization of potentiality) which might be considered, given that it would not =
be a stretch to consider Schwinger otherwise an adherent of the so-called orthodox interpretation 3
associated with the Copenhagen school, as well as from the invocation of the mechanism of
decoherence sometimes associated with the ‘new orthodoxy’ in the interpretation of quantum nee)
mechanics [18].
