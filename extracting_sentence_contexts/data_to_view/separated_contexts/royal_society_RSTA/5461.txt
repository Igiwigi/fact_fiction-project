If the whole spectrum is concave (a), Wss is the distance between Ds
the largest, ne, and smallest, hi, Holder's exponents, Wi and we are the distances between Hilder's exponent corresponding :3
to the maximum of the spectrum, h;°**, and, respectively, the smallest/largest exponent; if only a portion of the spectrum ed
is concave (b), the widths are defined for the concave portion only. Readers can find a numerical example discussing how the :s
singularity spectrum may have a non-concave shape in fig. 2 of [15]. (Online version in colour.) [3

singularity spectrum 8
Weg = hk — hk (2.7) a

where nR and hk are the right and left limits of the spectrum; the right component of Wss
WSs = hf — HX, (2.8)

with h?** the Hélder’s exponent of the maximum of the singularity spectrum, and the left
component of Weg
Weg = HP — hi. (29)

If the singularity spectrum is concave with a continuous first derivative, then its maximum occurs
at q=0. In fact, substituting the definition of /j in equation (2.5) into equation (2.6), one obtains

qx dME(q)
D(q) = 12" 2.10
iq ME@) en)
and calculating the derivative versus q
AD(q) _ 4 x d?ME(q) (2.11)

dq dq? Thus dD(q)/dq=0 for q=0, which corresponds to the maximum because D(q) is concave. In
practice, a(q) is estimated over a finite number of moment orders q spaced by Aq increments and
thus, the evaluated D(q) maximum is influenced by the Aq amplitude and the finite-difference
method used to calculate the derivative of the mass exponent.
