normal. Only in the case of HALDANE was there an appreciable fall in the alveolar
CO, pressure, the rate of walking having been somewhat too fast in his case to allow of
a completely normal oxygen supply to the body. From the foregoing sets of experiments it is clear that the excessive hyperpncea on
exertion at high altitudes is due firstly to the fact that the normal level of alveolar
CO, pressure is greatly lowered. On Pikeâ€™s Peak this lowering implied an increase of
about 50 per cent. in the volume of air breathed per unit mass of CO, produced in the
body. During hard muscular work the alveolar CO, pressure is still further lowered,
however, in consequence of deficient aeration of the arterial blood with oxygen.
