Since the date of v. SpEr’s paper many notable advances have been made in the
study of the phenomena of gastrulation and of the origin of the mesoderm, more
particularly in reference to the Sauropsida. It is now possible to identify HensEn’s .
knot in the Mammalia, including the “ neurenteric strand” developed from it, as well
as the forward continuation known as the “ head-process,” with the well-developed,
and often massive and laminated, archenteron of the Reptilia. We have seen in the
present paper how striking is the resemblance between the archenteron of Ornitho-

rhynchus and corresponding stages of the reptilian gastrula. We have also shown that
what we have termed the protosomites are in fact derivatives, en masse, from the
archenteric knot ; and that the cavities, actual or potential, found in their interior are
always representatives, or remains, of that originally wide transverse archenteric
lumen so well seen in our fig. 44, Plate 9.

Comparison of the foregoing account of v. Spexz’s observations with our statements
of the condition present in Ornithorhynchus can only lead to the conclusion that
the phenomena in the two cases are essentially identical, and that v. Spee was
fully justified in his conviction that the appearances he met with were not due to
merely fortuitous arrangements. The double masses of cells seen by v. Spee are
the same as those which we have designated protosomites in Ornithorhynchus.
Of these we have observed in one specimen five more or less distinct and consecutive
pairs, whilst v. Spee saw three. ‘The obliquity of their segmental arrangement
