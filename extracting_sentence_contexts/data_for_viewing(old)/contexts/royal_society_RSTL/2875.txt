of hydrogen are disengaged from the amalgamated wire, which soon cease, and in an
hour or two, a leaden grey spongy mass is obseryed adhering to the wire, which is
sometimes sufficiently bulky to fill the tube, and putting on much of the external ap-
pearance of a mass of cellular galena. This mass consists of a spongy amalgam of
ammonium, containing a very minute proportion of mercury ; it is lighter than the
s0lution in which it is immersed, for on adroitly separating a portion of it, it rises to
the surface and rapidly decomposes water, hydrogen heing evolved and ammonia
formed.

19. It is a very curious and interesting fact, that although this spongy ammoniacal
amalgam cannot be kept immersed in water even for a few instants without the for-
mation of ammonia, yet as long as it is connected with the negative electrode of the
battery, it may be preserved without change for days and weeks. The instant the
connexion with the battery is broken, a mass of this amalgam, as large as a walnut,
appears to vanish in a few seconds, torrents of minute bubbles being given off, and a
scarcely appreciable quantity of mercury being left on the wire. On again closing
the connexion with the battery decomposition recommences, and the amalgam is re-
produced.

20. From a review of the results of these experiments, we cannot help being struck
with the very energetic power of electric currents of weak tension ; currents of suffi-
cient energy to reduce to the metallic state oxides on which currents of higher ten-
