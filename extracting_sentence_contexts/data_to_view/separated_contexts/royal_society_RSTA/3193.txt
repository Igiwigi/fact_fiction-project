ionisation, which made Van ’r Horr’s law (in a slightly modified form) an accurate
expression of the relation between ionisation and dilution, down to twice decinormal
solutions of KCl. This method of procedure gave for the radius of the hydrated ion
an expression of the form

n= r_(1+Bh-*)-,

which indicated that the average radius of the ion steadily increased with dilution,
owing to increasing hydration of the ion, up to “infinite dilution.” Whether the
resulting expression for 7 did in fact represent the average radius of the ion was
tested by a consideration of the density law which would thence result. The volumes
of the ions would be proportional to 7*, and it was found that a rational density
formula could be constructed upon this basis which accurately corresponded with the
observed densities of the solutions. In the present paper the necessary experimental determinations for applying the
method to solutions of NaCl are given, together with some other determinations for
collateral purposes, and the hypothesis is further tested by reference to other physical
properties of solutions.
