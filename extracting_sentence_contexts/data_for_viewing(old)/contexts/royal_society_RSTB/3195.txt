simpler. This is in accord with the general observations of Watpscumipr
(see No. 10), especially as Mr. BasbBaGce was right-handed.

Lobus parietalis.

The complexity of the subdivision of the occipito-temporal and lower parietal
region, which was notable in the left hemisphere, is also present toa marked degree
in the right. This anatomical evidence of the high status of this brain is in harmony
with the view of CunnincuAm and others (see No. 1).

Sulcus post-centralis inferior vel Suleus parietalis transversus.—This very deep
sulcus subdivides the foot of the gyrus centralis posterior so as to leave but a small
portion of cortex in front and above. It is shortened by the fact that the sulcus
intraparietalis begins low down,

Sulcus post-centralis superior is an irregular and obliquely placed sulcus, its general
direction making an angle of 60° with the upper third of the sulcus centralis,
Hence, it marks off a broad piece of the gyrus parietalis.

Suleus interparictalis.—This suleus begins by a large and deep H-shaped origin,
and follows a course quite similar to that of the left side, but ends by a T-shaped
extremity just behind the suleus parieto-occipitalis, owing to the development of a
large occipito-angular annectent gyrus.

The lobulus parietalis superior is simply subdivided by a subordinate sulcus. A
