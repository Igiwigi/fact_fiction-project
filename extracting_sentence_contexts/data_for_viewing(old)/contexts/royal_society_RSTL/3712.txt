After half an hour or an hour's exposure to sunshine, a very beautiful negative
photograph is the result, to fix which all that is necessary is to oak it in water, in
which a little sulphate of soda is dissolved, to ensure the fixity of the Prussian blue
deposited. While dry, the impression is dove-colour or lavender blue, which has a
curious and striking effect on the greenish yellow ground of the paper produced by
the saline solution. After washing, the ground colour disappears, and the photo-
graph becomes bright blue on a white ground. If too long exposed it gets © over-
sunned,” and the tint has a brownish or yellowish tendency, which however is re-
moved in fixing: but no increase of intensity beyond a certain point is obtained by
continuance of exposure.

204. Prismatic examination of this process demonstrates the remarkable and valu-
able fact, that the decomposition of the salt and deposit of Prussian blue is due to
the action of the blue and violet rays, the less refrangible rays below the blue having
absoJutely no influence either to exalt or diminish the effect. The limits of action
are about, + 18'0 and + 610, fading insensibly both ways. The greatest intensity
of action is at + 38. A feebler maximum occurs at + 23. The intensity of the
impression is much increased by washing with acidulated water, still more if it hold
in solution a little persalt of iron, but in this case the ground, if not very carefully
defended from light, is blue.

205. If a solution of this salt, mixed with perchloride of iron in a certain propor-
tion, be washed over paper somewhat bibulous and exposed to the spectrum, a co-
pious and intense deposit of Prussian blue takes place over the region indicated in
the last article. But it does not terminate there. On the contrary, the action is con-
