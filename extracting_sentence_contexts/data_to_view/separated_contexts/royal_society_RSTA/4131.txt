Vaxj6 interpretation

This interpretation was born in attempt to combine consistently the views of Einstein and Bohr
[7]: realism and contextuality. This is the (ensemble) statistical interpretation. It was born from
the observation that, in fact, Bohrâ€™s contextuality does not imply non-realism. Thus, a theory can
(but need not) be both contextual and realistic. Contextuality has to be treated statistically as
contextuality of probabilities, their dependence on experimental contexts.
