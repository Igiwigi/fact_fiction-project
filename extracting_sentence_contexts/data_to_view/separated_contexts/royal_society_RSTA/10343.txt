Now we know (§ 12) that for the small values of the a’s, f, is of the form

Sr (%, My, ++ | = On

“a Hence there is a solution of the system of equations (52)

This is the series of circular configurations, and corresponds to the series of
Maclaurin spheroids in the three-dimensional problem. When o? > 2zp the solution
breaks down physically, since the pressure at every point of the liquid becomes
negative. In fact, when w* reaches the value w? = 2zp the series gives place to
a series of annular forms, for each of which has the critical value. We can adjust
the radius of the annulus so as to give any desired amount of angular momentum
greater than the critical value which occurs in the circular configuration when
w* = 27. Points of Bifurcation on Circular Series.
