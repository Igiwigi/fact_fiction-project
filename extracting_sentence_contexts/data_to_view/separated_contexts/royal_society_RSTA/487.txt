While the metabolism
of azobenzenes and aminostilbenes is no doubt radically different, and the biological fate
of the latter is still largely unknown, preliminary experiments by Dr L. A, Elson have been


AND CARCINOGENIC PROPERTIES OF 4-AMINOSTILBENE 183

sufficient to indicate some of the changes which these stilbenes are likely to undergo in vivo;
a few of these are shown in XIV to XVI for 4-dimethylaminostilbene in comparison with
known steps in the oxidation of 4-aminophenol (XVII to XX). It is obvious that these
are such as might readily be expected to interfere with the oxidative mechanisms of the
cell. Lastly may be mentioned a recently discovered fact, which promises to be the starting-
point for fresh developments. In experiments to determine the influence of diet upon the
growth-inhibitory effects of carcinogens, Elson (cf. Elson & Warren 1947) has found that
this initial inhibitory action can be greatly reduced by a diet sufficiently rich in protein.
