Discussion
2 Our results support the long-recognized association between
schistosomiasis and dams, and indicate that, across many of
3 the 14 dams evaluated, the increase in schistosomiasis after
Se. dam-building was dramatic. We further show that the effects
&§& S of dams on schistosomiasis extend far beyond the reservoirs
s & & created above dams, areas which have been the focus of pre-
ES z vious large studies. In fact, upstream catchments hundreds of
a = kilometres from dams often experienced schistosomiasis
=: increases after dam construction to nearly the same degree
Ss zs as did the populations near the reservoirs immediately
. § 3 upstream of the dams (figure 2).
