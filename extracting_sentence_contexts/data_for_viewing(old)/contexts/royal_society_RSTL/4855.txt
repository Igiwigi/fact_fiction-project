as to lose horizontal cohesion, as when it is divided into pyramidal masses. Now
this immediately follows from our theory ; for as s00n as lateral cohesion is destroyed,
any determinate inequality of motion ceases; each mass moves singly, and the
structure disappears very gradually#*.”

In explaining the theory of the veined structure at a meeting of the Royal Society
of Edinburgh on the 20th of March 1843, I stated that T had arrived at the conclu-
sion that crevasses resulting from tension in certain parts of a glacier, must be
formed at right angles to the surfaces of discontinuity or structural veins where they
intersect the surface: a law conformable to the empirical one discovered by me on
the glacier of the Rhone in 1841+, since generalized in other cases, and which even
the adversaries of my theoretical views have admitted to be a correct statement of
the facts *.

My attention was at that time (March 1843) turned by my learned and acute
friend Mr. W. A. Capes, to the veined structure of the slag of iron furnaces as due
to the difference of velocity of the parts producing surfaces of separation and peculiar
molecular condition. The transition was easy to the case of volcanic rocks and lava
