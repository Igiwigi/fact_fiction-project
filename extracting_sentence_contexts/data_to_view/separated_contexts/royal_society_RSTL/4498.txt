This operation is called rivet-
ing, and although practically understood, it has not, to my knowledge, on any previous
occasion, received that attention which the importance of the subject demands. Up to the present time* nothing of consequence has been done to improve or
enhance the value of this process. We possess no facts or experiments calculated to
establisb principles sufficient to guide our operations in effecting constructions of this
kind, on which the lives of the public as well as the property of individuals depend. In fact, such has been our ignorance of the relative strength of plates and their
riveted joints, that until the commencement of the present inquiry the subject was
considered of scarcely sufficient importance to merit attention. Eyen now, it is by
many assumed that a well-riveted joint is stronger than the plate itself, and a number
of persons, judging from appearances alone, concur in that opinion, Now this is a
great mistake, and although the double thickness of the joint indicates increased
strength, it is nevertheless much weaker than the solid plate, a circumstance of some
importance, as we hope to show in the following experiments.
