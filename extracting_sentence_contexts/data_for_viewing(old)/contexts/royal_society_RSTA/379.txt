with and managing risk [87]. A wide variety of prospective options exist, from
he effective use of climate information to paying smallholders for ecosystem
goods and services to increase household income. Some of these options are
ikely to be robust, even given the uncertainties that exist concerning future
patterns of climate change. But the lessons of the recent past teach us that
he difficulty of implementing many of these options in SSA should not be
underestimated: massive investment and increases in agricultural productivity
will be necessary if economic development is to succeed in Africa in the coming
decades [88].

Second, we need to go ‘back to basics’ in collecting data and information.
Difficult though it may be for many people to accept in the second decade of the
twenty-first century, the fact is that land-based observation and data collection
systems in SSA have been in decline for decades. This affects the most basic
data: weather data, land-use data, and crop and livestock distribution data, for
example. For instance, estimates of the cropland extent in Africa range from about
1 to more than 6 millionkm?, the value depending on choice of satellite-derived
product [89]. The uncertainty in such basic information (‘where are crops grown
and how much of them is there?’) adds considerable difficulty to the quantification
and evaluation of impacts and adaptation options. There is much technology that
is being brought to bear on data issues: remote sensing of weather information,
validation of different land-use products using Wikis and Google Earth (see
www.geo-wiki.org) and dissemination of market information using mobile phone
technology in East Africa, to name just a few. But many of these things need to
complement land-based observations, not substitute for them. A similar situation
