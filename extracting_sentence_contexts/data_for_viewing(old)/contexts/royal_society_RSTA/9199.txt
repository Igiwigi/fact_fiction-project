We shall calculate the sum of the first twenty terms in the first series and three terms
in the second. Denoting it by 8,, we have

P—Q>8.,.
To find an upper bound, we make use of the simple fact that (q@ — 7°) = (p* + q? + 7°).

Thus P — Q <8, + (the remaining terms with (p* +- q? + 7%)? written in place
of (@ — 7").

That is to say we have 7

where W’, = number of representations of 7 as a sum of three squares,
Write the above as
