And here the ratio
9: 2 occupies the place of the ratio 4: 1 or 8:2 on the other series. But the limiting
ratio of 7 :2 is in both series the same, and on the whole a certain increase of loss,
although not, a gradual increase, is to be observed with the increase of the chloride
taken. These experiments confirm the fact, that under similar cireumstances the
different preparations of the peroxide have a different reducing power. Experiments with Chloride of Silver at the temperature of the air. The next experiments were made also with the chloride of silver, but at a lower tem-
perature, the temperature of the air.
