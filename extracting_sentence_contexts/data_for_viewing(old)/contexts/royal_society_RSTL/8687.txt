dered as an infinitesimal portion of space or surface, may be excluded from and regarded
as not, belonging to the material space or surface. It is allowable, and frequently con-
venient, to regard g as a discontinuous function, having its proper value within the
material space or surface, and having its value =0 beyond these limits; and this being
80, the integrations may be regarded as extending as far as we please beyond the material
Space or 8urface (but 80 always as to include the whole of the material space or surface)—
for instance, in the case of a spatial distribution, over the whole (s+1)dimensional
space; and in the case of a superficial distribution, over the whole of the s-dimensional
surface of which the material surface is a part.

In all cases of surface-integrals it is, unless the contrary is expressly stated, asnmed
that the attracted point does not lie on the material surface ; to make it do 0 is, in
fact, a particular supposition. As to solid integrals, the cases where the attracted point
is not, and is, in the material space may be regarded as cases of coordinate generality ;
or we may regard the latter one as the general case, deducing the former one from it,
by supposing the density at the attracted point to become =0.

The present memoir has chiefly reference to three principal cases, which I call
A, C, D, and a special case, B, included both under A and C: viz, these are —

A. The prepotential-plane case ; q general, but the surface is here the plane w=0,
80 that the integral is
