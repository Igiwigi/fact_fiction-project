4. Magnitude of uv motions

Discerning a self-similar structure that connects the geometry and dynamics of the momentum
transporting motions naturally leads to consideration of the signal magnitudes. Features of the
magnitudes of uv motions are represented by the PDF, and an example is given in figure 3.
Figure 3a shows the PDF of the —uvt signal for yt near the start of the inertial domain at
5+ =10100 with a dark (coloured) solid line, whereas the light (grey) line is the cumulative
density function (CDF). The hatched regions show the percentage of data about the median. The
highly non-Gaussian nature of the PDF and the high concentration of data around zero magnitude
are clear. Figure 3b presents the PDFs as a function of y*. Interestingly, the shape of the PDF is
nearly invariant over most of the boundary layer, with an obvious reduction in width in the outer
region. This reduction in the PDF size in the outer part is a consequence of the non-turbulent
region interspersed with the turbulent uv-containing region. In fact, the (externally) intermittent

region starts at a yt of about (4)6+ [23], which is roughly the location where the width of the PDF
size starts to decrease.
