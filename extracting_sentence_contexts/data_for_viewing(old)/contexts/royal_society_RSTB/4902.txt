‘ genera) in the data.* The reader will find the results in Tables V to VIII (pp. 56-58) and
the values of +, 9, and Ny in Table IV (p. 54). The numbers of monotypic genera
observed and calculated must agree within a decimal point or so owing to the method
of fitting : but I think the reader who studies Tables V to VIII will admit that the agree-
ment between observation and calculation is throughout extraordinarily close. It
is in fact better than one has any right to expect. I admit very considerable difficulties
of interpretation and would refer to the discussion on pp. 58-62. Here I would only
direct attention to the rather large number of primordial genera found in each case
(Table LV, line 7, p. 54): to the comparatively limited range of values of + (4-26 to
6-28, ibid. line 5): and to the comparatively limited range also of the values of ¢
(1-188 to 1-925, ibid. line 6). Subject to the admitted difficulties of interpretation,
the results of this test, on the one point on which direct comparison can be made with
the facts, could hardly be better.

* If there are N genera in the data, and one primordial genus would only yield n genera after the given
lapse of time, we must have No = N/n.


28 MR. G. UDNY YULE ON A MATHEMATICAL THEORY OF EVOLUTION,

The next point considered (Section V) is the frequency distribution of ages for genera
of a given size: given, that is to say, N existing genera all of the same size, we require
to know how many of them are likely to be of each successive age. The non-mathe-
matical reader will do best to turn first to fig. 10, p. 66, showing the limiting forms of these
distributions for genera of 1 to 10 species after an infinite time has elapsed from the begin-
