FACIAL CHARACTERS OF THE NEANDERTAL RACE. 287

ScHwaxse's angle is given by ScHWALBE as 44° in the Neandertal, 46° in Spy I,
and 47° in Spy I, but as determined from his section it amounts to 51° 30’ in the
last-named skull; in the Australian skull it is 48° 30’,

Fic. 2.—Median curve of a South Australian skull (No. 998), showing ScHwaLze’s angle (cy), the
calottal nasion angle («f), and the superior inion angle (vA). (x 3.)

The Bregma Inde«.—If a straight line be dropped from the bregma perpendicularly
upon the nasi-inion line, a point (a, fig. 1) is obtained which is the projection of
the bregma upon the base (der Lage des bregma, ScuHwa.se), its position may be
calculated from the fact that the intercept is the cosine of the calottal nasion angle,
but it is much simpler and sufficiently accurate to read off its length directly from
a profile drawing of the skull ;* thus in the Australian skull it measures 685 millims.,
in the Neandertal, 78 millims. in length. The bregma index is obtained by multiplying
the length of the intercept by 100 and dividing by the length of the nasi-inion line ;
thus in the case of the Neandertal skull we have 78 x 100/192 = 40°6, in that of the
Australian skull, 68°5 x 100/184 = 37°2. ScHWALBE projects the bregma on the
glabella-inion line (a’, fig. 1), and thus obtains the following indices—in the
Neandertal skull, 38°4; Spy I, 34°5; Spy II, 35-2; in the Australian skull I find
an index of 36°8, which thus lies well within the limits of the Neandertal group.

The Frontal Angle.—In attempting to find a numerical expression for the retreating
character of the forehead, SoawaLBE makes use of the angle included between the
