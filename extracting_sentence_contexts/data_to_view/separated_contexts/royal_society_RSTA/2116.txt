The paragenesis
of metamorphosed rocks of Pacific Plate origin collected from IODP Expedition 366 cores spans
the gamut of metamorphic facies from zeolite [43], to greenschist [59], to blueschist [40,50,60]
(figure 6).

(b) Limestone compositions

Limestone breccia and cherty-limestone fragments were also recovered from the IODP Expedition
366 cores [53]. Cores from Yinazao Seamount recovered the first pieces of reef material (figure 7)
from a subducted Pacific Plate seamount from one of the forearc serpentinite mud volcanoes. The reefal cobbles recovered from Core U1491C-2H-CC-1-7 cm are, in fact, the first pieces of reef
material ever collected from a subducted plate seamount in the world (figures 1 and 5a,b). The
cobble analysed in detail is a Miogypsina rudstone with larger lithoclasts and coralline, red-algal
grainstone matrix. The matrix includes echinoderm, bryozoan and decapod fragments, small
benthic and a few planktonic foraminifera.
