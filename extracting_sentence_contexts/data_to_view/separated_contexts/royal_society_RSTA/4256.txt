The importance of ocean general circulation models (OGCMs) is so high that it cannot be
overemphasized. However, most OGCMs, if not all, had suffered from common problems such as
the simulated sea surface temperatures are too high, the simulated mixed layer depth (MLD)
in the upper ocean is too shallow, or the simulated subsurface temperature is too low in the
summer time [42] especially for the Southern Ocean [43], until the non-breaking surface wave-
induced vertical mixing was included into OGCMs [6] which much relieves the above-mentioned
common problems. In fact, all these challenges indicate that the vertical mixing in the upper
ocean has been underestimated. The weak point of the governing equations of all OGCMS is the
turbulence closure schemes which have very high uncertainty. Validation of turbulence closure
schemes seems a solution to determining which kind of scheme should be selected.
