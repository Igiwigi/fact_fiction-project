different parts of the country, and the terrific lightning of the storms in May, have
been already noticed.

Hail sometimes falls in the hot months of March, April, and May, in those thunder
storms to which I have alluded. The hail, which in many instances is found to con-
sist of masses of transparent ice, is of considerable magnitude. In the storms of the
21st and 22nd of April 1830 at Poona, the hail-stones were larger than marbles ; and
they were of a similar size in a hail-storm in the fort of Hurreechundurghur, at
3943 feet above the ea, in the preceding April. I have known a mass of clear ice
fall exceeding an inch in diameter, and I have been assured that much larger pieces
have been picked up. On one occasion at Poona the hail-stones consisted of globular
masses of clear ice, in which was imbedded a star of many points, of diaphanous ice
like ground glass; and I deemed the fact sufficiently curious to induce me to make
drawings of some of the stones.


AND METEOROLOGY OF DUKHUN. 191

Dews first appear towards the close of the monsoon, on the last mornings of Sep-
tember after cloudless nights. A precipitation of moisture takes place on similar
nights in October and November. In December dews usually become somewhat
constant and copious ; and they are seen in January and February ; but they occur
under yery anomalous cireumstances, the causes of which I cannot explain. In con-
secutive nights of similar temperature, and similarly cloudless, dew will be found to
have been deposited one night and not the following, In September 1827, the
