and the oblong (Plate V. fig. 6); the first of these being specially characteristic of
that simpler type of structure in which there is only a single layer of cells, but not
being confined to it; whilst the second is peculiar to the complex type, in which
there are two superficial layers, distinct from the intermediate stratum. Now the
occasional coexistence of both these plans of structure in a single individual (Â«| 33.),
sufficiently proves that the diversity of the surface-markings to which they respect-
ively give rise, cannot be regarded as a basis for specific distinction ; and when these
extremes of diversity are kept in view, it must be felt to be highly improbable that
Suny modifications of either form should possess greater importance. That such
modifications are mere individual varieties, is further evidenced by their gradational
"character, and by the fact that two or more of them may present themselyes in the
=ame disk. In my description of them, I shall limit myself to an account of those
more remarkable and frequently-recurring varieties, which will serve, I think, as a
Skey to any others that are likely to be met with. -S 49.
