The third nodule, “dx,” (fig. 64, Plate 41), seems to be an adventitious
epithelial body, since no similar structure has been seen in any other specimen in this
situation. It appears as a bud from the deep aspect of the mouth epithelium which
separates itself from the latter and forms a typical epithelial nodule between the
epithelium of the mouth and the surface of the enamel organ. There is a core of horny
cells more or less concentrically arranged and surrounded by a deeply staining capsule
of undifferentiated epithelial cells: a structure, in fact, remarkably like what one would
expect to find at a rather earlier stage in the formation of “‘dx,”. The nodule ‘‘dx,”’ is
peculiar, not only in having no relationship to the developing cusps, but also by being
considerably external to the whole enamel organ. The lower tooth ‘“‘y” has a pointed antero-lateral cusp whose apex bends medially.
