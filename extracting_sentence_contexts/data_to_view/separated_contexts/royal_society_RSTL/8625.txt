But when the sky was clear and there was a heayy dew, the sound could be heard as
far against a light wind as with it, and sometimes much further. On one occasion, when
the wind was very light (about 1 foot per second at 6 feet above the ground) and the
thermometer showed 39 degrees at 1 foot above the grass and 47 ag 8 feet, the sound
was heard at 440 yards against the wind, and 270 yards with it. Now the nights on which ARaGo made his experiments were clear ; there was a heavy
dew, and the thermometer at Montlh&ry showed that at that elevation the temperature
was 2* F, greater than at Villejuif; 80 that after the experiments just described there is
nothing surprising in the fact that the wind did not produce much effect on the
sound. A good reason (as I have previously stated) may be given in explanation of these
changes in the effects of the wind. The wind tends to lift the sound proceeding against
it and to bring down that which is travelling with it.
