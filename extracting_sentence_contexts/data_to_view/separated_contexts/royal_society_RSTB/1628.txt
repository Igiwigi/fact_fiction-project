Frorizp, GEGENBAUR). Consequently, neither the “atlas” nor the second vertebra of the Amphibia is
strictly homologous with the atlas of the Amniota; again, since “atlas” is the unalter-
able name of the first cervical vertebra of Man and the other Amniota, the second and
first hypoglossal vertebrae of the Amphibia are proatlantie vertebre. It would not be necessary to dilate upon these facts and obvious conclusions if
Axsrecut had not perverted them, and if he were not followed by a considerable
number of’ adherents, for instance, HorrMANN, WieDERSHEIM, Dotto, Baur, Howes. It is ALBREcHT’s merit to have pointed out that “ der m Spinalnerv eines amnioten
Wirbelthieres durch den x — 1" Wirbel desselben austritt (Lit., No. 3, p. 458).”

He argues: If we put n = 1, then the first spinal nerve of the Amniota passes
through vertebra | —1, or 0. This 0" vertebra, to which belongs N. spinalis L.,
must have been situated between the atlas and the occipitale, and may be called the
Proatlas.
