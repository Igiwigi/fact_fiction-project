The interesting question arises whether the relatively shallow-rooting Poa trivialis
predominates on the nitrate plots by reason of its fine surface roots arresting and taking
up the nitrate before it has had time to penetrate too deeply. This view is favoured
by the fact, of the rapid growth which this plant invariably makes upon the application
of the nitrate of soda in the spring. Another point worthy of remark is the contrast
observable on plot 14, between the shallow-rooted Poa trivialis and the deeper and
wiry-rooted Bromus motlis. In moist seagons, when the latter is relatively deficient,
Poa trivialis is luxuriant, and vice versd.

This is a robust, free-growing grass, with strong, stout, fibrous roots, descending
more or less vertically to a considerable depth, and together with other more horizon-
