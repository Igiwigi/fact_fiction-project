Ficure 3. A portion of the radial nerve cord stained intra-vitam with methylene blue, flattened out
and viewed with its internal surface uppermost. The small diagram of the cord as seen in trans-
verse section shows the levels of the neurons and fibres included in the main figure. c.dist. central
distributory motor neurons; ¢.t. connective tissue lamella flooring the radial perihaemal canal;
pl.deep, deep fibre system of the association plexus; p/.sup. superficial fibre system of the association
plexus.

stained with Mallory’s triple stain, while failing, on the other hand, to show the axon
collaterals, represent the association system as made up of about 90 to 100 separate bundles
each containing several fibres. There are thus about 80 to 100 axon collaterals, as shown by
one technique, available for connexion with some 90 to 100 longitudinal bundles, as shown
by another. The numerical correspondence is interesting in view of the fact that the scheme
of innervation put forward (Smith 1945, figure 4) as a possible basis for the observed patterns
of movement of the feet embodied, as one of its principal features, a precise numerical and

spatial relationship between the motor neurons and the underlying tracts of the cord. It is
therefore the more to be regretted that the spatial characteristics of the pattern have not
been more accurately resolved.
