the numbers A1x,...,Ax, and the numbers A1,4—1,..-,Ak—1,k—1, then the group Hy, is isomorphic to
TS), Thus, in this case we have

S(E1) = Tes) (5.4)
and the fibre
Fol(A) = TN Des (5.5)

is a torus of dimension N — }°;.s(k), where N = n(n — 1)/2 is the dimension of regular fibres and
>. 8(k) is the total number of diagonal equalities in the Gelfand—Cetlin triangle.


Remark that, in this case, the momentum map F is smooth at F —1(A), and F-!(A) is an elliptic
singularity of co-rank )°; s(k), so the fact that it is a torus of dimension N — )°;s(k) fits well with
the general theory of non-degenerate singularities of integrable Hamiltonian systems (see [8]).

(d) Spherical singularity of a generic orbit of u(3)*
Take n = 3 and consider a generic co-adjoint orbit of dimension 2N = 6. Choose A = (A1,1,42,1,42,2)
such that Az = 22. The inequalities in the Gelfand-Cetlin diagram imply that we have 41,1 =
421 = (2,2 =A2.
(i) Computation of G(E*)
We simply apply proposition 4.3 to obtain:
—G=uv}),
— G=U(v?),
— G3 =U(W)) © U(W2) 6 U(W3), where each W; has dimension 1.
