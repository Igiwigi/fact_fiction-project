There
are a few reasons to do that. The first is that Price himself was not entirely clear about
whether the equation was to be used for deriving hypotheses
from theory assumptions, or for testing them using data (see
[1, p. 520) and [3, p. 416]). The second reason is that the Price

equation, when applied to data can, in fact, have a meaningful (iii) Model B plus noise

and later users of his equation borrow concepts and terminol-

ogy from statistics, seemingly suggesting, or at least allowing wisa+b pte gre, 1=1,...,m.
