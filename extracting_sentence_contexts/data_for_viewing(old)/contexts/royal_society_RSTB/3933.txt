422 MR. W. E. AGAR: EXPERIMENTS ON INHERITANCE IN PARTHENOGENESIS.

investigate inheritance within parthenogenetic animal populations from the point of
view of JoHANNSEN’S well-known work. The terminology adopted is accordingly in
agreement with that introduced by him, in spite of the fact that some objections
have been raised to the use of the word genotype in JOHANNSEN’s sense, on the
grounds of its prior usage with a different meaning by systematists.

Where it is necessary to express the group of individuals descended asexually (in
our case parthenogenetically) from a single ancestor, the word clone has been used,
following Suuty. As this author points out, the extension of JOHANNSEN’s term pure
line to include groups of individuals related in this way is not legitimate. It must
be distinctly understood that a genotype, and hence the individuals forming a
biotype,* need not be homozygous as long as they all have the same factorial
composition. In sexual reproduction such heterozygous biotypes are easily
recognised on breeding, but in asexual reproduction where Mendelian segregation is
not taking place, they cannot be distinguished in this way from homozygous ones.
