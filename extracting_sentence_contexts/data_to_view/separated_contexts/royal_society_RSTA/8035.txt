If we accept the words “ an efficient test of the hypothesis H ” to mean simply such
a rule of behaviour as just described, then we agree with Bore that efficient tests
are possible. We agree also that not any character, x, whatever is equally suitable to
be a basis for an efficient test,t and the main purpose of the present paper is to find
a general method of determining tests, which, from the above point of view would
be the most efficient. In common statistical practice, when the observed facts are described as “‘ samples,”
and the hypotheses concern the “ populations” from which the samples have been
drawn, the characters of the samples, or as we shall term them criteria, which have
been used for testing hypotheses, appear often to have been fixed by a happy intuition. They are generally functions of the moment coefficients of the sample, and as long as
the variation among the observations is approximately represented by the normal
frequency law, moments appear to be the most appropriate sample measures that we
can use. But as Fisner{ has pointed out in the closely allied problem of
Estimation, the moments cease to be efficient measures when the variation departs
widely from normality.
