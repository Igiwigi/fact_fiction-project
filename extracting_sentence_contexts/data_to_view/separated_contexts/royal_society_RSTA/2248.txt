The detailed description of H, will follow, our present
object being the derivation of results applicable in general to the whole series of
curves, with H, as a convenient illustration. The values of g decrease as the separation of the components increases. This can
be deduced from the fact that the final slope of all the curves to the axis of Â« (the
base of the photograph) is smaller than the initial slope. For the final slope is
derived from the final branch, Tere = Le" 4+2 > QT.
