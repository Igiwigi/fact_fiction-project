With the flowers of benzoin.

Moſt modern chemiſts haye looked upon the gum
benzoin as a refinous ſubſtance, which bears the
ſame analogy to the vegetable reſins, as the ſucci-
num or amber does to the foflil bitumens; and
they have eſteemed the flowers of benzoin to be. an
acid falt, mixed with an oily and a ſmall propor-
tion of an earthy matter ; but have brought no
proof of its being ſo,

drams: and a half of the flowers of. benzoin into
ſome water, and then dropped into it by degrees a
ſolution of the foffil alkali; every drop raiſed an
ebullition or efferveſcence, in the ſame manner as
when any common alkaline falt is thrown into an
