‘Two estimates are
inserted for RbP (which were deduced from P (1.2.8)), the larger are based on K.R.’s
estimates of possible error, the smaller on L.’s estimate of probable error; the truth
probably lies between the two. Different positive and negative errors appear under
RbS and KD. This is due to the fact that small permissible errors were introduced
into the observations giving the constants in order to bring all the calculated series
within limits. The values of v inserted in the table give the values used in correcting
the two sharp series to a constant v. They are not the same as those given elsewhere
as the most probable values, but as they were used in the original calculations, and as
nothing was to be gained by recalculating, they are left as they were. The first column under each series gives the value of the limit A; the top number
being its value and the lower the value of the D when it is written in the form N/D*.
