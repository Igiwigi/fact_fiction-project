Finally, consider the case of fluor-spar (CaF,) for a special reason.

As regards relative positions and intensities the spectra are exactly the same as
those of diamond. If we begin with a face-centred lattice of calcium atoms, we must
so move out from it two similar lattices of fluorine atoms as to obtain the observed
relative intensities. This we do by moving them along the cube diagonal, but
in opposite directions, the distance moved being one quarter of the length of the
diagonal. This gives a highly symmetrical structure. A fluorine atom lies at the
centre of each of the eight cubes into which the large face-centred cube can be
divided. The (100) planes of fluorine now lie half-way between the (100) planes of
calcium, and we explain the disappearance of the first order (100) spectrum by
supposing that they have equal reflecting powers. We assume, in fact, that two
fluorine atoms of weight 38 are equivalent, within errors of experiment to one atom
of calcium of weight 40. This is only one instance out of many; it seems certain
that two planes containing equal weights per unit area are equivalent in reflecting
power, no matter how the weight is made up nor how it is distributed in the plane. As
regards distribution, this is what we should expect: as regards the effect of weight
the result is not so obvious, though it cannot surprise us if we suppose the scattering
to be due to the cumulative effect of the electrons and nuclei of the atoms.

In the simple cases which we have been considering, the considerations of crystal
symmetry, though unable of themselves to determine crystal structure, come so near
to doing so that a few plain hints given by the new methods have been sufficient for
the completion of the task. The exact positions of the atomg are then known.
