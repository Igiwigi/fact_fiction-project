& 12. THE TWO MODES OF TURBULENCE CAUSED BY THERMAL INSTABILITY

& While the description given in § 11 of the initiation of turbulence by thermal instability
‘g is in agreement with general ideas on the subject, the mathematical theory which has been
6 developed in the preceding sections is limited in its applications by the fact that the inertial
term in the equation of motion has been neglected. An essential element in all turbulence
phenomena, namely, the transfer of energy from one Fourier component of the velocity
fluctuation to another has been ignored. The linear character of the equations resulting
from this neglect of the inertial term implies that each Fourier component evolves in-
dependently of the others. Consequently, the energy appropriate to each wave number a
must remain indeterminate; and the distribution of energy with a must also remain beyond
the scope of the theory. On these grounds, we might have expected that a fundamental set
of solutions of equations (126) to (133) would contain a single arbitrary constant. Instead,
the solutions given in § 9 actually contain two arbitrary constants corresponding to the two
positive roots a? and a3 of the cubic equation (182) for a. The occurrence of these two con-
stants in the solutions implies that there are two principal modes of fluctuations for A>A yin
