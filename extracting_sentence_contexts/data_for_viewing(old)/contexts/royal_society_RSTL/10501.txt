L Beryllium and samarium give a very faint phosphorescent spectrum, consisting of a

S red, orange, and green band only ; the green occupying the position of the second

S green band given by calcium-samarium.

AQ 148. Thorium and samarium give a very similar spectrum to the one produced by
barium or strontium with samarium, a slight difference being observable in the orange,
which shows signs of separation into two components.

Thorium, as oxide or sulphate, by itself gives no phosphorescence (26, 28), and in
fact, as T have already shown, renders the vacuum tube non-conducting ;* samaria

* «his earth is, however, remarkable for its very strong attraction for the residual gas in the

—— Yaenum tube. On putting thorina in a tube furnished with well-insulated poles, whose ends are about

@ millimetre apart in the centre, and heating strongly during exhaustion, the earth, on cooling, absorbs

| the residual gas with such avidity that the tube becomes non-conducting, the spark preferring to pass

86yeral inches in air rather than strike across the space of a millimetre separating the two poles.” —Proc.
