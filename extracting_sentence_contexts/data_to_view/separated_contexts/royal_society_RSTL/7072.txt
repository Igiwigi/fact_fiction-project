'The polar currents contain less salt, than the equatorial. I have determined the
quantity and nature of the salts in two very well-defined polar currents, —the West-
Greenland polar current, with 33:176 per 1000 alt, and the Antarctic polar or Pata-
gonian current, on the west side of South America, which contains 33-966. It is highly
interesting to observe that the East Greenland current, which according to its geogra-
Phical relations might be considered as a polar current, which in fact has been con-
Sidered in that way, has a very high mean quantity of salt, viz. 35:278 per 1000, while
the sea to the north of Spitzbergen, according to one analysis, contains 33-623 per 1000
8alt. IT think I sﬆhall afterwards, from other phenomena also, prove that the Kast
