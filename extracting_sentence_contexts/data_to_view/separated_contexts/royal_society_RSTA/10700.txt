On the 6th, and again on the 7th, loud noises rose from
the crater, and the red glare was visible in the steam cloud. But as yet no
earthquakes ; even though a rift could now be seen to have opened at the base of
Morne Lacroix. Wednesday, May 7th, the day of the great eruption of the Soufriére, was not
marked by any special features in Martinique.* That day the mountain was, in fact,
rather less violent than it had been on the 6th; but on the following morning, at
7.50, the great convulsion came, and with it the end of all things for St. Pierre,

So deadly was the blast that swept the city, so awful in its completeness the
destruction that it wrought, that few survived who saw the great black cloud ”
descending from the mountain, but of those few there are some who have placed on
record what they saw, and it is clear from their descriptions that in Martinique there
was a repetition of what had happened in St. Vincent on the previous afternoon.
