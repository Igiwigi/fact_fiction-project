In effect, a new scientific subfield dedicated to the study of coupling
functions has started to emerge, paving the way to specialized scientific gatherings on coupling
functions in the form of minisymposia, workshops and conferences, as well as to dedicated
reviews. Thus the topical issue has emerged naturally to unite and document these activities in
one place, thereby bringing out the universality of the coupling function as a theoretical construct. The need for a theme issue is perhaps most strongly supported by the fact that the applications
of coupling functions span such a great diversity of very different scientific areas. Although
originally stemming from physics and mathematics, applications have now emerged in, for
example, chemistry, neuroscience, physiology, system microbiology, mechanics, climate science,
secure communications and the social sciences. The experts in these separate fields seldom
encounter each other or come across work on coupling functions by scientists in the other areas.
