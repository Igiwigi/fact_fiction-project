I have attempted in the following table (fig. 11) to group together the different
classifications of “ occipital” or ‘“ calearine” cortex to which I have previously
referred. It will be seen that my own classification agrees exactly with those of
Meynert and Berz, except in the absence of a scattered spindle layer, which omission
T have already alluded to (pp. 184-185), and in the fact that the layer which I speak
of as “ polymorphic,” is described by Mrynerr as consisting of deep granules, and by
Berz as being composed of isolated pyramids. It also agrees with that of Scunapp,
except in the detail that he subdivides layer 2 into two parts. Krause subdivides
layer 1, and groups layers 2 and 3a as his third layer.
