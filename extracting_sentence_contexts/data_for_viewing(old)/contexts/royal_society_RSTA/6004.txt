J(t; Xo, Yo) = det (Sx ) 7

(Xo, Yo)

where X(t), Y(t) are the x- and y-components of the pathline with initial positions Xo, Yo. A
computation of the area of the 2-torus T? gives an identity to be satisfied by the Jacobian:
Jao dx dy = 4n2 = Jae I(t; Xo, Yo) dXo dYo, or in terms of averages:

U(t))o=1, (4.9)

where (f)9 denotes an average over the ‘label’ variables Xo, Yo. Noticing that J is positive as long
as there is no blowup, we can interpret J(t; Xo, Yo) as a probability density on the 2-torus.
From the fact that V;, - u, = —y we readily obtain an evolution equation for J:

J; X0,Yo) _

Te Xo, Yo) XOXO.) => It Xo, Yo) = exp (- I, v(X(8), ¥(s),8) as) ,

0
and using equation (4.7) we get J(t; Xo, Yo) = [A(#) (1 + (A + 1)y0(Xo, Yo) Jo(1/A(s)*) ds)" V/A),
Finally, replacing this solution into condition (4.9) and defining the increasing function
