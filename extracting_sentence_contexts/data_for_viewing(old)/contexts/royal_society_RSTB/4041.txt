when walking at two miles an hour and was not influenced by the duration of the exer-
tion, this throws us back for an explanation on an alteration of the metabolism, which
would mean that during the exercise a larger proportion of carbohydrate was utilised
than in the resting period.

We make this suggestion with some diffidence as it is contrary to the accepted
view, for the great majority at least of the previous observations have shown that the
relative proportions of carbohydrate and fat consumed remain the same during work
and rest.* Very likely a longer duration of the exercise than in our experiments would
have given a lower value of the respiratory quotient, for if carbohydrate is being
more readily used than fat, prolongation of the exercise must lead to a diminution of
the amount of carbohydrate available. It is possible that our result is bound up with
the fact that we were taking an ordinary diet with our meals at the usual times, and
therefore had at all times no scarcity of carbohydrate in our tissues.

We admit, of course, that the nearer the respiratory quotient approaches to unity

* Since we wrote the above Dr. E. P. Carucart has communicated to the Physiological Society the
results of some experiments made with BENEDICT, which afford strong evidence of the greater utilisation of
carbohydrate during muscular work. He has also drawn our attention to the work of AMAR (‘Le Rende-
ment de la machine humaine,’ Paris, 1910), who has obtained results pointing in the same direction.
