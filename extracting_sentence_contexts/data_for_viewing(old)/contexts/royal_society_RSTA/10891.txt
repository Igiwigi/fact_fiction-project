exists varies enormously, even in sign, as we pass from one local race to another.
This want of correlation, or want of steady correlation, in the parts of the skull, as
compared with the correlation exhibited by the long bones, or by parts of the hand, is
extremely interesting from the standpoint of evolution. It would appear to be much
easier to modify a single character of the skull by selection without altering other
characters than can be the case with other parts of the skeleton.
The measurements considered in this paper are: L the greatest length, B the
greatest breadth of the skull, H the height measured from the auricular line, I the
= cephalic index = B/L, and C the capacity. In choosing the material several points
2 had to be borne in mind :
§ (i.) A sufficiently large series must be used.
& Asa matter of fact, 50 to 100 skulls are considered by craniologists to be a fair
© series, but such numbers are small from the mathematician’s standpoint.
‘© (ii.) Material must be drawn from as widely different races as possible, if we are to
“= measure the legitimacy of applying results obtained from one local race to another,
S  (iii.) The capacities must have been determined by competent observers using
S approximately like methods of measurement.
‘= The data which seemed to me to approximately fulfil these conditions are the
