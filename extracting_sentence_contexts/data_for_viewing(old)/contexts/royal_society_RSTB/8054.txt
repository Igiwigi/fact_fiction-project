perature, the mean of one set of measurements will not differ significantly from that of
another set made at a different time.

As well as these random errors of measurement (usually called the accidental error of a set
of measurements), there may be another error due to inaccuracies in the scale of the
measuring instrument itself. This is called the systematic error and will be a constant for
all similar measurements taken on the same instrument.

There is, however, a third type of error, which is usually ignored by physicists and
chemists, although astronomers have long recognized its importance. This is due to the
idiosyncrasies, psychological and physical, of the observer. These errors are often taken
as constant and included in the systematic error. However, the work of Karl Pearson (1902)
and others has shown that these personal errors are not, in fact, constant, but show
a secular trend with a rather slow, irregular rhythm. As ‘Student’ (1gr7) says: ‘After
considerable experience, I have not encountered any determination which is not influenced
by the date on which it is made; from this it follows that a number of determinations of
the same thing made on the same day are likely to lie more closely together than if the
repetitions had been made on different days.’

In biological work, these slowly fluctuating errors, called by ‘Student’ the secular error
of the observations, are of great importance. This is because in biometrical studies it is
usually impossible to define exactly what is actually being measured. The more accurately
a character can be defined the more objective the measurements of it are likely to be.
In this sense the measurements of, say, the length of the test of an echinoid are less
objective than the measurements of the length of the metal rod, since in the first case it
