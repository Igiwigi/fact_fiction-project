Eleven toads were thus injected, and the effect was of the same kind in all cases,
though it varied somewhat in degree. This might be expected from the varying
effect of different preparations of secretin and the varying response of different
animals as seen in experiments on mammals. There was a very great increase
of the tissue, which we have now frequently described, and have called islet tissue.
This increase is due, as always, to a conversion of the secretory alveoli, In the
specimen, of which a section is reproduced in fig. 11, the change is very extensive.
The exhaustion is very complete, no zymogen granules being found in any part
of the section, and a very large proportion of the whole tissue of the gland has
undergone the change into islet tissue. A few alveoli retain their identity, and a
large number can be seen in various stages of conversion. The condition of the
whole gland, in fact, is very similar to that of the small portion of dog's pancreas
shown in fig. 5. Scattered in this transitional tissue are several fully formed islets
of the resting type, which were presumably present before the injection of secretin.
This specimen was obtained from a winter toad. A control toad, not injected with
secretin, gave pancreas sections very similar to that shown in fig. 9.

Another feature of this exhausted gland, not included in fig. 11, was a very large
area studded with nuclei, which nearly all showed mitotic figures. The production
of these mitotic figures is thus also clearly accelerated by the action of secretin.
In fig. 12 is seen, under higher magnification, a portion from another pancreas less
completely exhausted, the discharge of zymogen granules being not quite complete.
In the middle of the field is seen a large area composed of faintly staining cells, with
nuclei so faintly stained as to be visible with difficulty in the photograph. A few of
