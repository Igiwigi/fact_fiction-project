is to depress that part of the surface towards which the shear is acting. In fact
the greatest contraction throughout the cylinder occurs near the points z = + 2¢/3
and appears due to this effect.

Near the ends the cylinder broadens out again, as we should expect, though it is
to be noted that the distorted generators meet the plane ends obliquely, which
should not be the case if the condition of no stress over the plane ends were
accurately fulfilled. This we know is not so: there is a system of finite shear over

the plane ends, as is easily seen on referring to the table of v2 on p- 172, This
