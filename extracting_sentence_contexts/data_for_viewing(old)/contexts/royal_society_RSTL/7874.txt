under the head of occasional errors, as explained further on,

1t seems very difficult to discern, & priori, the nature of the errors incurred in estimating magnitudes by the
eye, or of errors arising from the imperfection of our senses, 8uch as those incurred in pointing to & star with
the naked eye. It is quite posible that snch errors may arise each from 8veral sources, though their nature be
hidden from our view,

* A ximilar lay to that mentioned above seems to prevail in many kindred cases. Thus in the '8uocessive
improvements in artillery, machinery, &., in proportion as the greater sources of imperfection and inaccuracy
are understood and remedied, the number of minor disturbing influences which are thus rendered perceptible,
and Â«till vitiate the results, though to a less extent, increases rapidly. We may even trace a sort of analogy
here in yarious phenomena both of the moral and material universe, which apparently haye no bearing on the
Point wo are considering. Thus the principal wants of human nature, the necessaries of life in fact, are very
few; and 80 long as these are 8upplied with difficulty, minor wants are 8carcely felt, as we 8ee in uncivilized
communities ; but when the greater wants are atisfied, the number and variety of the secondary requirements
of our nature are yisible in the multitudinous productions of civilized life. The diseases which mainly operate in
8hortening human existence are yery fow in number; but could they be extirpated, the number of minor causes,
of nearly coordinate importance, which still would influence the rate of mortality would be very large. =
statistics of crime, and many other phenomena, would give rise to remarks of a similar nature,

this absolutely ; thus it is not enough for our purpose to show, could we do 80 conelusively,
