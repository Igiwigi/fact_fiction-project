In this work, we consider the flow of a two-phase Newtonian fluid (e.g. water and oil) in a
two-dimensional channel that accommodates a number of circular obstacles (discs), geometrically
displaced according to the Apollonian packing [13-16]. This particular assembly, which has
been used in previous investigations [17,18] about the dependence of k with respect to packing
composed of obstacles of different sizes, aims to describe the main properties of a fractured
medium with grains of different sizes. For such packing, Â¢ and k depend on the number and size of discs [17,18], a fact that influences
the results discussed herein. We would like to call attention that usual porous medium studies
consider that the whole region where the fluid flows is somewhat homogeneous. This differs from
the described model set-up, which is characterized by the presence of obstacles in a limited region
of the channel, the rest being obstacle free.
