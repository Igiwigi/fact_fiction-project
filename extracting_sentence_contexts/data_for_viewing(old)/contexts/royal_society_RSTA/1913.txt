discovery and subsequent development of the periodic table and Darwin’s discovery of evolution
and the subsequent development of evolutionary biology [6].

To highlight the cascading impact of Mendeleev’s 1869 advance, we reproduce here simply a
single commentary, taken from a standard scientific text of that time; this is ‘Atontic Theory’ by Ad
Wurtz [1], published just over a decade after the first publication of this advance:

The work of Mendeleev has lately thrown a new light upon the relations existing between
the atomic weights of the elements and their properties. The latter are a function of the
atomic weight, which function is periodic. It is not limited to such and such a group of
elements, but embraces all of the elementary bodies of chemistry ...thus dealing with the
most varied and the most profound questions of science ...in a word, regard the facts of
chemistry from a lofty and comprehensive point of view.

Mendeleev first challenged the world and then led us to confront how prepared were our
minds to recognize an advance of sheer brilliance—a genuine seminal advance—which, quite
simply, changed our world the day after its appearance in 1869.

Besides the discovery of the periodic law of the chemical elements, Mendeleev also made other
critical contributions to chemical problems of broad scope. For example, it is perhaps not well
recognized that Mendeleev studied the origins of petroleum and launched the idea of the so-
called ‘abiotic origin’ hypothesis that hydrocarbons originated from iron carbides by the action of
water vapour in the deep interior of the earth. He wrote: ‘The capital fact to note is that petroleum
was born in the depths of the earth, and it is only there that we must seek its origin’ [7]. Remarkably,
