A further aspect to climate projections not explored within CMIP5 is the impact of model
resolution. Changing the resolution of the ocean and atmosphere models can have a significant
impact on the simulation of the seasonal cycle of sea ice extent; in the HadGEM3 climate model


[22], Rae et al. [23] show that increasing ocean resolution can lead to changes in sea ice which
are larger than or comparable to changing parameters in the sea ice model physics, whereas
Williams et al. [24] show that the simulation of ice extent and volume is more accurate at higher
atmosphere resolution. There is also indication of the sensitivity to resolution in future projections
of Arctic sea ice in the HadGEM3 [25]; when atmosphere model resolution is increased, the rate
of ice decline appears to be increased. There is clearly uncertainty over internal variability, as
discussed earlier, yet current computing resources preclude the possibility of large ensembles
of climate projections at high resolution. Nevertheless, these results point to the fact discussed
earlier that the sea ice simulation and its decline is highly sensitive to the climatic forcing of
the system.

3. Using energy budgets to evaluate climate models ~
As discussed in ยง2, estimates of Arctic sea ice decline can be improved by subselecting models : yy
based on their skill at representing certain aspects of the present-day sea ice state. However, (3
comparing models based on their ability to simulate sea ice extent and volume accurately may aes
lead to choosing models which have compensating errors (i.e. they may give a good simulation 22
for the wrong reasons). Evaluating models at the process level of their energy budgets would : xs
not only allow model fidelity to be better assessed, but would also allow errors to be identified DN
and quantified. : =
