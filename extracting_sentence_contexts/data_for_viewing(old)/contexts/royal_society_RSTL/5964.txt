The genus Nerine, first defined by Dr. JonNns0N, affords by far the most favourable
conditions for the study of the segmental and reproductive systems of any of the Nereid
families. The coast near Swansea is inhabited by three species of this genus (viz. IV. vul-
garis, N. comocephala, N. beata (mihi). 'The last, and unfortunately the rarest, is beyond
comparison the best adapted for the purposes of the present investigations. In this ele-
gant worm the entire apparatus (as represented in fig. 18 «6 c and a bc) may be readily and
clearly defined by the eye. It is here quite easy to demonstrate the connexion between
the ciliated tube (fig. 19 @ b) and the appended mass (Cc c c) of the germinal products.
This mass fills completely the hollow bases of the foot and the entire chamber of its own
Segment. 1t embraces the ciliated tube (ab). It is evidently a part of the latter ; and yet
in the most transparent specimen (Nerine beat, mihi) it is utterly impossible to define
how the germ-products escape from the tube (@ b) into the mass (cce). But the author
is most anxious to draw especial attention to the fact of the presence of this ovarian or
sperm-mass (according to the sex) in constant and visible association with the ciliated
looped tube. It serves to reflect light upon the as8ociation of the same parts in speci-
mens in which, the demonstration is necessarily obscure. Tt, illustrates the principle
contended for in this paper, that the * segmental organ ” is the true and real source of
the generative products ; in other words, that the latter are THE organs of reproduction ;
the masses appended to the latter, hitherto mistaken by DE QUATREFAGES for ovaria and
testes, themselves being only the utricular or spermatic receptacles of their products.

There is no discoverable difference between the segmental organ of Nerine and that of
