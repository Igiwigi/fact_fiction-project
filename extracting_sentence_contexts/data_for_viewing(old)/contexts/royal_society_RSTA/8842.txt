fundamental response. These responses will be called ‘‘ Subharmonics.”’ Their origin
is made clear in fig. 1, which also shows why the even-order subharmonics $n, }n, §n,
&c., are non-existent. When the alternating current represented by (a) is interrupted
at its frequency n, all the negative elements are suppressed as shown in (bd), giving a
unidirectional current in the galvanometer. When interrupted at $n, as in (c), an
equal number of positive and negative elements are passed through giving no resultant
current in the galvanometer. But when interrupted at 4n as represented in (d), there
is a resultant current due to the odd positive elements. This is the third order sub-
harmonic, and it will be seen by comparing (b) and (d) that it has one-third the magnitude
of the fundamental.

The presence of these subharmonics is not so objectionable in practice as one might
expect, in fact their frequencies and relative magnitudes have on certain occasions
assisted in the identification of the fundamental with which they are associated. There
is a close analogy with grating spectra, inasmuch as each subharmonic corresponds to
a spectrum of a different order. The even orders are absent just as in a grating where
the opaque and transparent parts of the grating-element are equal in width. If the
intervals of make and break are unequal, then the even-order subharmonics are
introduced.

A type of interrupter has been constructed in which by repeating the sequence of
