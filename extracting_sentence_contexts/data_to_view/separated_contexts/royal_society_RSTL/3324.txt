This
object, which in a good 34-inch refractor has only the appearance of a white
| cloud, I saw in the above instrument resolyed into-an immense number of
brilliant small stars. In my telescope also it is resolved into apparently as
great a number of stars, but the full power of the instrument is exerted, and
still the resolution seems scarcely complete. In fact, my instrument appears
to labour to effect what seems to be quite within the power of the other. I I wish particularly to direct attention to this object and that of 3 Capricorni,
A because, where the same object can be seen without any very apparent differ-
E ence in two instruments, or where it can Ã¾be only seen in one, the great test of
- comparison is lost ; but in those I haye mentioned, the exact limit of power is
= defined. SD
