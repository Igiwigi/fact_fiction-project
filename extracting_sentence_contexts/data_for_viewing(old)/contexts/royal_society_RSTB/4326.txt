stage, and appears as a compact flattened cell-mass, with only traces of its former
lumen. It is now encapsulated.

Remarks on Thymus I.â€”Thymus III, the mammalian thymus, as HAMMAR
terms it, is noteworthy in Trichosurus on account of the mode of origin of its
primordium from the entire caudal, as well as the ventral wall of the third
gill-pouch, In other words, thymus III is here not an exclusively ventral product

of the gill-pouch, but also involves the caudal wall of the dorsal portion of the
pouch. The interest of this mode of origin lies in the fact that, whereas in the
majority of Eutheria, as well as in the Monotreme Echidna, thymus III is
developed exclusively from the ventral portion of the gill-pouch, in the Reptiles, as
the observations of DE Mxruron (36), VAN BemMeELeEn (4), Maurer (33), Perer (42),
Sarnt-Riimy and Prenanr (51) have shown, the primordia of the thymus arise in
the form of bud-like outgrowths (primitively of the nature of evaginations according
to the last-named observers) from the dorsal ends of the gill-pouches (1, 2, and 3 in
the case of Lacerta, thymus I being vestigial). In the case of the third pouch in
Lacerta, however, Maurer finds that the dorsal thymus primordium is directly
continued into a small ventrally directed appendage, representing the last remnant
of the ventral diverticulum of the pouch. This he regards as a vestigial ventral
thymus primordium, which is destined to disappear without forming thymus tissue.
Sart-Rimy and PrENANT also record the existence of this ventral primordium of
