These numbers seem to indicate that with potentials greater than 240 volts an
ordinary vacuum discharge took place at some point or points in the tube ; in the
following experiments care was therefore taken never to use potentials greater than
80 volts

§ 4. Relation between the Current under a given Voltage and the Temperature. In the case of sodium, owing to the fact that the current could not be saturated,
its value under a given electromotive force was measured at different temperatures. This comes to practically the same thing as measuring the saturation current, since
we should expect, ceteris paribus, the current with a given electromotive force always
to be proportional to the number of ions liberated at the metal surface. In order to
be sure of not getting a discharge, a potential of about 80 volts between the wire
A,B,, and the cylinder was always employed.
