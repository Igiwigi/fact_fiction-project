begins, in the case of the male, upwards from 25, and in that of the female, upwards
from 18 years.

2. That the legitimate fertility does not remain at the same level for many years
together, but that it declines immediately after reaching the highest point.

These results do not agree with the view of physiology, according to which the
generative power should remain for some time at the same height. But we ought
not te lose sight of the fact that the legitimate fertility is to be regarded as the
resultant of two different forces. The number of children born in a family is, in fact,
not a consequence of the physiological power only, but also of the wish to have
offspring. In a family where children already exist, the wish for the increase of them
is weaker and will be weaker, the greater the number of offspring. Now as the number
of children increases with advancing age, the force of the moral factor increases also
with the age. Thus passing from younger couples to older ones, we pass at the same
time from small to large families, that is from those where the wish for offspring is
greater to those in which it is less, where consequently the influence of the moral
factor is preponderant over the physiological one. It is to this preponderance that
we must attribute the fact that the probability of birth diminishes so rapidly and so
regularly with the advancing age.
