Further, as will
be shown later, they can be produced in densely packed masses by the heat-treatment
of a mercury amalgam, where the film can have no mechanical strength. They are
quite independent of the supporting surface, appearing in exactly the same way on
optical glass, quartz glass, and the natural crystal faces of diamond and mica. Still
more remarkable is the fact that when a comparatively large (111) face of a silver
crystal has been formed by heating, as discussed later, and a second film of silver
deposited on it by sputtering, then, on reheating, this second film gives rise to
particles on the crystal face, which have the same appearance and properties as
those on the surfaces just mentioned. Such particles on a silver crystal face are shown
in figs. 14, 15, 29, 30, Plates 15 and 17.
