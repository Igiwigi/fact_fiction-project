Electricity offered the
prospect of energy available to all on equal terms. Electricity was modern, it was good, and it was
democratic. Perhaps for this reason, Americans in the early-twentieth century were proud of the
fact that the USA used as much electrical energy as ‘all the rest of the world combined’ [26, p. 339]. If using power was good, then using more power was better. But not all Americans were using it equally.
