For example, it is well known that for
compliance minimization the thickness of the ‘walls’ of the microstructure should be proportional
to the stress that it has to sustain in its direction. This is rigorously proved for two-dimensional
rank-2 laminates [11] and it is numerical evidence for rectangular holes in a square cell [31]. Note
that this fact is different from the optimal orientation of orthotropic materials [22] which is already
taken into account by taking 012 = 0. Intuitively, the macroscopic optimization algorithm will tend
to propose large/elongated rectangular holes when dealing with pure traction stresses and more
symmetric holes when dealing with more hydrostatic loads. Therefore, it is likely that microstructures which have a semi-axis ratio my /m will be favoured
by the structural optimization process at places where the stress tensor ratio |o11|/|o22| has similar
values.
