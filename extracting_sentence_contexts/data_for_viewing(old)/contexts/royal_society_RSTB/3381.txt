to our formula. If we finally consider Group © in Table XV, of an average weight of
3460 grammes, and containing seven females and one male, we find an average blood
constant k of 1°20, as compared with 1°58 in our own experiments, which is to say
that the CO method in this case gives a blood volume more than 31 per cent.
greater than it should be for animals of this weight if calculated according to our
formula.

In the light of what has been said, and independently of whether the experiments
are calculated according to our formula B = W?/h, or as percentage of the body weight,
it is evident that while the CO method, in smaller animals of about 2000 grammes
in weight, gives approximately the same results as we have found, there is a definite
variation as the animals increase in size, a variation which can only be accounted for
by the fact that there must be substances in the organism other than the circulating
haemoglobin which have the power of combining with CO, and which are present in a
quantity that increases not only absolutely but relatively as the animals increase in
weight, which will in normal animals mean increase in age also.

This being the case, it is clear that, as we have already stated in our preliminary
communication, great caution must be exercised both as to the results obtained by the
CO method, and the value of the deductions based upon them.

On the other hand, the method might be useful to show the difference between
the amount of circulating hemoglobin, and of the extravascular hemoglobin or
substances behaving like hemoglobin in its avidity for CO. It is impossible to
express any certain opinion upon this matter until definite experiments have been
