In 1928 Lupwic described a fusion of the cranial extremity of what he terms “ chorda ”


WITH HEAD-PROCESS AND PROCHORDAL PLATE. 479

with the mesoderm, in an embryo with—according to Lupwic—one paired somite,
which fused area is, we think, none other than a prochordal plate.

In the same year Fiorran (1928, 6) figured a prochordal plate in an embryo with four
paired somites (embryo Bi III), but without recognising it as such. Porrrzer (1930),
in describing the prochordal plate in his embryo Ct with seven paired somites, has
identified the structure in question in the figures of the embryo Bill as a prochordal
(completion) plate, and this identification we accept. As a matter of fact, Frortan had
recognised it as such before Porrrzer’s paper was published. Potrrzer also recognised
the existence of a prochordal plate in the embryo H 197, BarretMez-Evans (1926).

The observations of the authors mentioned above indicate that the production of
mesenchyme by the prochordal plate in the human embryo does not reach its
maximum prior to the differentiation of the somites.

(B) Conclusions—We may now summarise the foregoing review of the available
material illustrating the development of the head-process and the prochordal plate as
follows :—

The earliest specimen in which the head-process is undoubtedly developed is the P.
