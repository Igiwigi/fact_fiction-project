~ But few observers have concerned themselves with the development of the oophyte
and the process of fertilization in this group. In fact, we owe almost all our know-
edge on these subjects to the researches of Hormetster and STRASBURGER, especially
the latter. Hormurster (2 and 8),* though he followed out most carefully the development
of the embryo sac and corpuscula in Pinus and Picea, could make very little of the
actual manner of fertilization. According to his observations the nucleus of the
oosphere or “corpusculum” disappeared after a time, becoming dissolved, and in
its place a number of free cells and nuclei made their appearance.
