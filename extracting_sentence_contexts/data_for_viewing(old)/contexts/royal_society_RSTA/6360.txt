single time period t of the bridge crack propagation, all nodes will move along these trajectories
two lattice units to the right. As a result, we note that the maximal displacement of each
node may be achieved at some time during the movement of the node along these curves. An
example includes the node indexed as 7 =3 along the red curve in figure 3a, whose maximum
displacement occurs for a non-integer value of n.

As expected, figure 3aâ€”c shows that all displacements for n < 0 do not exceed u;, represented
by the horizontal dashed lines in these plots. In fact, the displacements of even nodes are
approximately uniform along the upper horizontal row of the chain when 7 < 0. The same is true
for the odd-numbered nodes, which have displacements of approximately the same magnitude
but with opposite sign. The result implies that the structure possesses an alternating strain
deformation ahead of the bridge crack front [36]. In all admissible regimes computed below, this
behaviour located at 7 < 0 is typical during the bridge fracture process. In fact, in the next sections,
we demonstrate that it is the behaviour of the structure within the bridge crack zone at 7 > 0 that
provides an upper speed limit for this failure regime.


Additionally, the analytical model developed above assumes (0) = tc, which is the case for
all trajectories shown in figure 3. For 7 >1, the trajectories undergo oscillations. This results
from the release of waves during the bridge fracture process that travel outward to the right of
the front. In relation to this, as demonstrated in figure 3, for n > 0 the displacement amplitude
of even-numbered nodes can increase with increasing a, whereas the displacement amplitude
of the odd-numbered nodes will decrease. Physically, this observation corresponds to the fact
that stiffer vertical links will prohibit the odd-numbered nodes for n > 0 from undergoing large
displacements, whereas the less constrained even-numbered nodes in this region will be more
