An old established and respectable druggist tells me,
that until recently (and the practice probably still exists in many places) it was the
invariable custom of the trade to mix one part of spirits of wine with every two parts
of ether. And I remember examining some ether in use by a young friend who pro-
fessed to take hygrometrical observations with this instrament, which I should say
contained a still larger proportion of alcohol in combination with water. This ana-
lysis of its composition is based on the fact that it might be used ad libitum, without
depressing the temperature more than two or three degrees. Long experience has
convinced me, that unless the evaporating fluid be pure, the results, if obtained at all,
cannot be depended upon. 'The Ether rect. fort. should, if possible, be employed.

observations, and to catch the temperature at the exact moment when the annulus of
dew begins to form on the dark bulb in the plane of the internal liquid surface,
