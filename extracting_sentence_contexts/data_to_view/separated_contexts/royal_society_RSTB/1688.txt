5 and 6). It cannot be too strongly emphasized, that the protoxylem does not lie on the limit
of the primary and secondary wood, but is placed in the interior of the primary strand
tself, so that the development of the primary wood must have been partly centripetal
and partly centrifugal. This fact is well illustrated by fig. 6. The leaf-trace shown
in that figure has reached a point on its outward course where secondary wood is no
longer formed, yet the position of the protoxylem in the interior of the ligneous
strand is quite obvious.
