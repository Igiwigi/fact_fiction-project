In conformity therewith I should
undoubtedly judge that the “consentual unions” recognised in the Census are
certainly not to be regarded as permanent unions, and, indeed, I would express the
opinion they are by no means so frequently permanent as the Census officials, here

here to call attention to the fact that while the proportion of living whites is
115°09 males per 100 females, the proportion of deaths is 129°76 ; whereas, on the
other hand, the proportion of living coloured is 93:95 males per 100 females, the
proportion of deaths is 92°2; a result which would seem to be not unfavourable to
the view already expressed as to the ultimate persistence of the coloured race

in Cuba. The Proportion of the Sexes produced by Whites and Colowred Peoples in Cuba. The returns dealt with are for the years 1904—5-6, and, throughout, those for
whites and coloured peoples are kept separate.
