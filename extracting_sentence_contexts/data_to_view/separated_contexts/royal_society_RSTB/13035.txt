The state diagram
summarizing these results is shown in figure 1c. Similar
phenomena have been seen in bacterial ‘persisters’ [83,84],
but to our knowledge, this is the first example of a discrete,
permanently destabilized target morphology in metazoa. Two interesting facts should be noted. First, the decision
whether to make one head or two is made by each fragment
independently: two pieces cut from the same worm do not
always make the same choice—each piece undertakes its own
‘coin flip’ between those outcomes (it is not set by the parent
worm). Second, this decision is stochastic at the level of the
fragment, not the individual cells.
