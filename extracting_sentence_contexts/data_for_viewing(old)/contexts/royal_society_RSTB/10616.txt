characteristics dominated guidance [10].

In this research, the landing position of the first saccade rep-
resents a replication of full scene visibility conditions in [10].
Once again, our findings clearly demonstrate that scene gist
had an influence on search behaviour, in that the landing pos-
ition of the first saccade was more likely to be in one of the
likely locations than in the unlikely or implausible locations.
However, in contrast with what we found in our earlier
work, with a scene preview the first saccade landing position
was no closer to the initial (likely) target position than when
no preview was presented. The failure to replicate might be
due to the fact that participants quickly learned that the
target always moved and sometimes ended up in an implausi-
ble location. These characteristics of the experiment would
likely have demotivated participants to use the preview.

The only effect of a scene preview on inspection behaviour
throughout the task was that it slowed search time when the
target was in an implausible location. Although the direction
of this result is consistent with the use of scene-gist information
to guide search (in this case misdirecting participants to look in
likely locations), it is unclear why a preview would have only
this effect. Earlier research found an effect of scene preview on
time to find the target but not on verification time [10], so
