The results of these experiments show that Nrumanny’s law may be regarded as
approximately valid for the specific heats at all temperatures. They also confirm the
view that the specific heat of a solid is not a measure of the work done in separating
the molecules of the substance, but that its amount is determined almost entirely by
the nature of the atoms composing the physical molecules. All the facts at our disposal show that there is not a great difference between the
specific heats of elements in the solid and liquid states, but that in every case the
latter is the greater, as shown in the following examples :— -
