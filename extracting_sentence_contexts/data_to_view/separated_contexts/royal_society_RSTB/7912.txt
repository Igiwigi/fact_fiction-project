Means or
medians are then employed for purposes of comparison. The defence of this practice
would appear to be that, from the very nature of palaeontological material, it is impossible
to do any better. In fact, however, it is possible to avoid making any such assumptions
about the age distribution of the sample if ‘size’ parameters, such as means and medians,
are abandoned for the purpose of comparison, and ‘shape’ parameters are used instead. The age distribution of the sample will have little effect, if any, upon the values of the
estimates of ‘pure’ shape parameters. This makes the use of the latter of particular value
in quantitative palaeontology, where the age distribution of the sample is dependent upon
that of the original living population in a very complex and indirect way.
