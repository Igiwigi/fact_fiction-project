We note that there is no consistent association between ACS and the other criteria for the graph
formats within either pair. Only one of the associations of the 23 tested is statistically significant
(p = 0.04), but, as this association has been observed in isolation, it should be treated with caution
due to the potential risk of a type I error in this case. The fact that we did not find consistent
associations is interesting, given our initial hypothesis that the ACS would be associated with the
other criteria. If respondents were better judges of their actual understanding of a graph format,
we would have expected this to be at least reflected in higher correlation coefficients and more
significant associations for the relationship between assessed and perceived comprehension. It is
possible that other factors influence the association between assessed comprehension and use,
such as the type of planning decision at hand or the prior knowledge and experience of the
respective colleague(s) in question for use for showing to others.
