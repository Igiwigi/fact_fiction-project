the more ready become the cells to form auxospores. The degree of overcrowding
necessary to induce auxospore formation becomes much smaller in narrow cells and
the auxospores develop into broad cells which reproduce side by side with the cells of
the original size.

Cells from the same culture will form auxospores much sooner in pure sea water
than in “Erdschreiber’’. They will, however, not develop into broad cells unless
transferred from sea water into “‘Erdschreiber”’.

Broad cells develop from newly formed auxospores in 2 days, from older ones in
3-7 days.

Cytological observations on Ditylum Brightwelli, particularly the fact that young
auxospores were found containing one big and two small nuclei, give support to
Persipsky’s view that reduction division and an autogamic sexual process precede
auxospore formation. No microspores take part in this process.

Intracellular bodies resembling microspores as described by several authors were
only found in Chaetoceros didymus and Ch. pseudocrinitus. They are interpreted not as
reproductive cells but as products of an abnormal cell division.
