When ethylene is exploded with less than its own volume of oxygen, the propor-
tion of marsh gas found in the residue increases as the volume of oxygen is diminished.t
This points to the formation of marsh gas as an intermediate product in the explosion
of ethylene.

Again, it is a matter of frequent observation in the analysis of coal gas, when the
residue of marsh gas, hydrogen, and carbonic oxide is exploded in an eudiometer,
with a large excess of oxygen, that carbon is deposited towards the bottom of the
tube. When, however, the mixture is sufficiently diluted with air, the marsh gas is
completely burnt. This fact is easily explained on the assumption that in the
explosion-wave (which is set up in marsh gas with oxygen but not with air) the
marsh gas is more or less decomposed in the wave-front, and some of the liberated
carbon escapes combustion by cooling. {

I do not forget that the question raised concerning the breaking up of yet unburnt
compounds in the explosion-wave, may also be asked concerning the elementary mole-
cules. What happens, for instance, to the molecules of oxygen in the wave? When
a molecule of oxygen reacts with a molecule of hydrogen, is an oxygen atom liberated,
and, if so, how far does its existence influence the rate? It was with the object of
obtaining some answer to these questions that experiments were made on the rate of
explosion of hydrogen with nitrous oxide, in which reaction it is possible that no free
