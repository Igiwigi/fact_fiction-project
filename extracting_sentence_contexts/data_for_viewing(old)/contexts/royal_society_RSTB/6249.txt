Considerable reserve is advocated in investing particular vascular channels with
special morphological significance. It is suggested that such speculation should
always be preceded by intensive study of the variability encountered in the particular
area.

A particular example of such morphological speculation which appears to be well
founded is the derivation of the stapedial artery from the dorsal section of the hyoid
arterial arch. In the chick, any such definite association with the mandibular arch
seems less clear.

The attempt has been made to prepare the way for an experimental study of the
backward migration of the aortic arches. Several facts of the manner in which this
takes place are disclosed by observational study.

The theoretical ideas of SHELLSHEAR concerning the laws underlying the develop-
ment of blood vessels are discussed.
