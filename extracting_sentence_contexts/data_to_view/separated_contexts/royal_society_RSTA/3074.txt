I will show that the volume-averaged PDF explicitly depends upon the spatial gradients even
though those gradients are absent from single-point distributions. In ยง4, I will perform the
spatial averaging of the balance laws over finite volumes. That averaging is complicated by the
nonlinearity of the equations and by the fact that the velocity field is not necessarily smooth on
length scales of the mean free path. The remarkable result of all these calculations is that the macroscopic equations are precisely
those derived in [4] by finite-scale coarse-graining of the NSE. In ยง5, I will describe their relation to
the regularized Euler equations that form the basis of most numerical simulations of fluid flows.
