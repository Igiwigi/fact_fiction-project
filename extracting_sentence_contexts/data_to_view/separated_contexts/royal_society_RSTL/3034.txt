It is probable that part of this yariation will be traced to particles of dust
in the air drawn into and about the circuit. I belieye also that part depends upon a
variable charged condition of the surface of the glass vessel a. That the whole of the
effect is not traceable to the influence of circumstances in the vessel a, may be de-

are not straight, and often pass otherwise than by the shortest distance. These ya-
riations in air itself, and at difterent parts of the very same balls, show the presence
and influence of circumstances which are calculated to produce effects of the kind
now under consideration.
