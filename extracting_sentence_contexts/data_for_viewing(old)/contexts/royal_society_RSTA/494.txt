Hp-free complexes are often electronically unsaturated and stabilized by bulky ligands around
the metal centre(s). An example shown in scheme 8 is the reversible addition of two molecules of
Hp to the cluster [Rh6(P!Pr3)6Hi2][BAr{] to give [Rhg(P!Pr3)6Hi6][BArt] [67]. Related coordinate
unsaturation in clusters enabled via loss of a weakly bound ligand in the solid state (such as
NCMe) allows for solid—gas reactivity of Os3(CO),;L (L=NCMe) with CO, NH3 and Hp [68].

Deliberate installation of coordinate and electronic unsaturation at a metal centre means
that solid—gas reactions can be made particularly facile. Caulton and co-workers have reported
that 16-electron Ru(CO))(P'Bu2Me)2 adds Hp, Clz or O2 to give the corresponding 18-electron
complexes cis,cis,trans-Ru(H) (CO) (P'Bu2Me)), cis,cis,trans-Ru(Cl)2(CO)(P'Bu2Me), and Ru(n?-
O>)(CO)2(P'BuyMe)z, respectively. Interestingly, reaction with HSiMe3 gave the dihydride
Ru(H)2(CO)2(P'Bu2Me)2 dissolved in liquid Me3SiSiMe3, formed by a dehydrocoupling process.
Reaction with CO is particularly slow, and this is postulated to be due to the fact that
the product, Ru(CO)3(P'Bu2Me)2, is a similar size to the organometallic reactant, and this
results in surface passivation rather than the fracturing of the crystal (and concomitant
faster ingress of gas) that is suggested to occur when product and starting material
geometries are different [38]. The electronically and coordinatively unsaturated complex
