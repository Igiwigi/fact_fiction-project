The general idea of our approach is to establish an explicit, though approximate, link between
the coherent velocity components of the resolved part of an LES and the coherent part stress
components near the wall. In our derivation, a quantitative distinction between the coherent
and incoherent parts is made with the help of a triple decomposition, while a dynamic mode


decomposition (DMD) of a large-scale DNS database is used to extract phase-averaged (coherent) 3 |
structures and their temporal dynamics.

We employ the triple decomposition, introduced by Reynolds & Hussain [6], in which 3
a turbulent field u is divided into a time-averaged (i), a phase-averaged, coherent (i), : o
and a random, incoherent (u’') component. The phase-averaged component is defined by :<
the fact that the background turbulence is eliminated and only the organized motion is : Zs
retained—mathematically expressed by (u)=i+u where (.) denotes the phase-averaging : a

operator. Relations resulting from this decomposition, which will prove advantageous in the
derivation below, include (u’) = 0, confirming the random nature of the background turbulence,
and iw’ = (iw) =0, showing that the background turbulence w’ and the organized wave

motion it are statistically uncorrelated. In the above, the overbar-operator * indicates a long- 8
time average. Dos
