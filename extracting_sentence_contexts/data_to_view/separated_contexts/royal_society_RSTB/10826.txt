The difficulty of controlling cheat- growth regulation systems in multicellular life. Because a
ing when genetically diverse cells come together to form an growth regulation system based on proliferative signalling
organism probably explains why multicellular aggregates, can be easily hijacked, selection favoured a complex system
such as Dictyostelium, are generally smaller and less complex of checks and balances on growth that involves many hor-
than multicellular organisms that develop as a clone from a mones and growth factors whose activity is monitored and
unicellular bottleneck [22,25]. In fact, one viable strategy for controlled by a complex genetic network [30,31].
stabilizing cooperation in aggregative multicellularity is for Cheating can be horizontally transmitted among clonally
the cooperating cells to ‘walk away’ from aggregates where derived multicellular organisms via pathogens. For example,
the burden of cheaters is too high [26,27]. The ability to when human papilloma virus (HPV) causes a chronic infec-

walk away also applies to cheaters, which may spread from tion, it hijacks the host cells, interfering with the p53 and


pRb tumour suppressor proteins, and causing their host cheating in both demographic cooperation and economic 5 |

cells to become cheaters, which may eventually evolve cooperation may both be required for cancer across species
into cancers [32]. [4].
