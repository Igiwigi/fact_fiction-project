heated in the gas for any great length of time, because it was known that long continued

heating caused the wire to disintegrate, its surface becoming covered with a network
of cracks. The present paper contains an account of a series of experiments in which
wires were heated for long periods in hydrogen, so that any gradual changes in the
effect of the hydrogen could be observed. It appears that continued heating in
hydrogen alters the character of the effects observed, so that the behaviour of an old
wire may be very different from that of a new one.

In the previous paper I suggested that the effect of hydrogen was due to the
presence of hydrogen in the surface layer of the platinum, and this view appeared to
be supported by the facts. Professor O. W. Ricuarpson (‘ Phil. Trans.” A, 413,
vol. 207, 1906) puts forward a different theory, viz., that the hydrogen alters the
state of the platinum, so that the effect may remain even after the removal of all the
hydrogen,

If the wire is heated in oxygen the large leak always immediately disappears, so
Professor RicHARDSON supposes that the oxygen destroys the change in the state of
the platinum produced by the hydrogen. According to the other view the oxygen
burns up the hydrogen present at the surface of the platinum,

The very large increase in the negative leak produced by hydrogen has been
recently confirmed by several observers, including O, W. RicHarpson (loc. cit.),
