sometimes very 8evere ; now was frequent, but the total fall was deficient in January,
and but little above the average in February and March. Vegetation generally was
very backward, and grass land was very brown and bare. April, May, and June, the
three months of most active accumulation and growth, were largely deficient in rain ;
and with the exception of about a fortnight at the end of April and the beginning of
May, when the weather was cold and cloudy, the whole period was unusually warm
and 8unny; the three months together being not only much warmer than the average,
- bub very unusually deficient in rain. The day temperatures especially were high,
though the night temperatures were in April and May low ; and throughout the three
months the degree of humidity of the atmosphere was considerably below the average.

Thus, after an autumn very deficient in rain, and fluctuating as to temperature, a
winter and early spring very stormy, very fluctuating as to temperature, in fact very
inclement, and vegetation consequently very backward to start with, the three months
of most active above-ground growth were very unusually dry, very unusually hot in
the days, and frequently colder than the average in the nights. It was under these
conditions that the smallest crop of the 20 years was obtained.

Upon the whole, then, the registered meteorological conditions of the season of
least productiveness more obviously account for the deficient crop, than do those of the
previous season account for its excessive yield. In the case of the very defective crop
of 1870, the conditions previous to the period of active growth were strikingly un-
favourable for the herbage ; and the period of active growth was itself strikingly
adverse, both in its extreme dryness, and in its coincident high day and low night
temperatures. In the case of the excessive, but succulent and immature growth of
