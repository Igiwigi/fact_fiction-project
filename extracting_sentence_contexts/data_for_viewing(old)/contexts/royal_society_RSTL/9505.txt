(3.) The method of adapting the equations of steady motion to the case of impulsion
is given in Section XT.

Tn Section XII. is shown how it first became apparent that the extremely low
pressures at which alone the phenomena of the radiometer had been obtained were con-
8equent on the comparatively large size of the vanes, and that by diminishing the size
of the vanes similar results might be obtained at higher pressures ; whence followed
the idea of using the fibre of silk and the spider-line in place of the plate-vanes.

(4.) In Section XIL it is also shown that while the phenomena of the radiometer
result, from the communication of heat from a surface to a gas, as explained in my
former paper, these phenomena, also depend on the divergence of the lines of flow ;
whence ib is shown that all the peculiar facts that have been observed may be
explained.

(5.) In Section X. it is also shown that the phenomena of transpiration, resulting
from a variation in the molecular constitution of the gas (investigated by GRAHAM), are
also to be explained by the equation of transpiration.

(6.) Section IT. (Part I.) contains a description of the experiments undertaken to
verify the revelations of Section X. respecting thermal transpiration ; which experi-
ments establish not only the existence of the phenomena, but also an exact correspon-
dence between the rexults for different plates at corresponding densities of the gas.

(7.) Section III. contains a description of the experiments on transpiration under
