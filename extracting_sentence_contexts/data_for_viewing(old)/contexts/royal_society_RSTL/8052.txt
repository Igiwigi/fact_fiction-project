E the systole, the yalve resumes its position through its own elasticity, ng up the

= Beyond this valve the conus turns towards the left, and then for a very short distance
EZ forwards. Quite at the end of it, and immediately before it bifurcates, there are two
pairs of (ganoid) valves (e), narrow, and rather long, with stiff non-collapsing walls, thicker
<S along the middle than at the sides, and without tendinous chord, in a single trans-
2 verse series. Their tunics are continued in four narrow raised strips behind their
S bases* (F). So far I have found the arrangement of this part of the heart nearly
AQ identical in two examples. On examining the firs: example, a pair of small papillary
prominences (fig. 7, g') were found in a line between the series of stripes and the spiral
valye, immediately in front of the latter. These stripes and papillze appeared to me to
represent rudiments of a second and third series of valves, analogous to the plurality of
series in other ganoid fisghes. Remembering, at the same time, the fact that individual
yariations in the development and number of valves are not of uncommon occurrence in
these fishes, I examined the heart of a second (ï¬†maller, female) specimen, and had the

satisfaction of finding my supposition confirmed. In this specimen there are, in the series
corresponding to the pair of small papille, four valves (fig. 6, g) corresponding in position
to, but much smaller than, the permanent large valves which I haye described above.
