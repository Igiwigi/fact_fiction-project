I have adduced here only such cases as are known and described ; but having carefully
examined large collections of bones from the Eocene and Miocene deposits, T have been
struck with the recurrence of similar facts. Trying to reconstruct the extremities of 80me
Paridigitata of the Lower Eocene from Mauremont and Egerkingen, and of Miocene forms
from Rochette, I could distinctly perceive that all genera which have left no direct sncces-
sors, and which are entirely extinct, present the same rigidity and persistence of the
typical relations; on the contrary, those which have representatives in the living creation,
their direct successors, exhibit much more pliancy and much better adaptation to altered
circumstances of locomotion, along with the reduction in the number of digits. Before proceeding to consider the two remaining groups of Paridigitata, the
Ruminantia and the Suina, we may draw the attention of the reader to the fact
that these two groups of Paridigitata are the only onesf which now people the
earth ; there is no greater diversity than this; and every living Paridigitate (if we
except the Hippopotamus) is always clearly a ruminant (including the Tragulide and
Camelidz) or a Sus, How striking is this poorness of different types if we compare it
with the rich and diversified forms presented by the recent Carnivora or Rodentia. The
extreme diversity of generic forms and specific modifications, coupled with the enormous
range of distribution of living Paridigitata, produces a false impression of the diver-
sity presented by this order ; but in reality there is'no 8uch diversity, and all the extremely
rich assemblage of Paridigitate Ungulates that people the earth in our time are only the
result of the modification of two typical forms, the Suina and the Ruminantia. The

latter term is a yery objectionable one, as the faculty of rumination has nothing to do
with the skeleton, and in reality it would be no wonder if some of the Imparidigitates
 ——_— the same faculty.
