delivery, comes to the same conclusion as I do. The idea of the transformation of
cellules conjonctives en cellules épithéliales,” he says, was so repugnant to him that
he for some time disregarded preparations which appeared to show this, and it was not
until he had many preparations to study, that he convinced himself, that uterine
epithelial cells are actually formed from the uterine stroma; of this fact he clearly
states he has now no doubt, and he considered his evidence irrefutable.

JOHNSTONE also (No. 9) believes the epithelium of the human uterus, which takes
the place of that thrown off during menstruation, is regenerated, not from the remains
of the old epithelial layer, but from the connective tissue structures which underlie
that layer.

Kiersnowski (No, 10), on the other hand, denies the fact. He gives an historical
account of the literature of the subject of the regeneration of epithelium, and a very
complete list of papers. His own work was done upon the regenerating uterine
tissue after delivery, of various animals, and he arrives at the conclusion, that the new
epithelium is derived either from existing surface epithelial elements, or from the
epithelium of the uterine glands. He points out, that in numberless places, flat
epithelial cells can be demonstrated to be continuous with pre-existing columnar

epithelia cells, either of the surface or of glands, and he denies that these flat cells
are formed from the connective tissue cells below them.
