same in each. In fact it is to be expected that there may be a concomitant change
in them also, but they can only differ by a few multiples of the oun. The important
point to notice is that for large values of m, the effects of such differences become
negligible and the observed separations from the standard D should approximate to
+21°25, which is that due to 26, on the limit. It will not be necessary to go into
such a full discussion as in the standard series with D (0), except for the first three
sets, where the evidence for changed sequence terms with displaced limits is conclusive
and important. The lists and sounders are given in the same table as for the
standard series, in the first and third columns respectively. The considerations adduced
enable us to feel that the ground is safe in recognising that parallel series depending
on displacements on the limit D(«)=S() really exist. The evidence does not
depend on a single numerical coincidence of a line, or of a line found by sounding, but
on the fact that these numerical coincidences appear for so many sounding links in
all the 15 sets tested. This is not affected by the high probability that several of the
sounded lines are chance coincidences, This result then gives more confidence to the
method partially applied above, in the application of the law that the D sequences
must have mantissee which differ by multiples of the oun from multiples of A,, or in
other words must be themselves multiples of the oun. This method consisted in
testing certain lines to see whether by using the displaced limits (y3,) D (c%)—now
seen to really exist—the above relation holds.

The evidence seems to show that the typical lines—D(«) = S(o)—for m= 1
have been much affected by displacement effects, and that consequently the intensities
of the normal lines themselves are much diminished. Although this is some
disadvantage, it will be well to attempt here to get some insight into the complete
