The deficiency
lay in the distribution of forces in the system rather than in their magnitude. Secondly,
it was clear that the rotational tendency was lost as soon as forward speed had been
acquired. In fact, if the forceps holding the insect were travelling forwards at an
appropriate speed, the state of motion of the insect remained unchanged on liberation. This was demonstrated by mounting the forceps holding the insect on a small trolley,
drawn along two horizontal wires by a cable from an electric motor. The trolley
travelled for about 3-0 m. prior to the release of the insect, whose path on liberation
was observed directly against a squared background.
