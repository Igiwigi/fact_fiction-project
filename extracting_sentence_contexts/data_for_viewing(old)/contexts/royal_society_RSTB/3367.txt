found in and above a seam, then it is at once called the “ Bullion” or “ Upper Foot”
Seam, and consequently it is stated that the structures occur only in the one
horizon, viz., the “ Bullion” Seam!

In the course of our work certain facts have been discovered, the details of which
are given below, and other facts have been drawn from the literature on the subject,
which appear to demonstrate clearly that this horizon is not so unique as the workers
just quoted have believed it to be. A strong point against their view is found in
the occurrence of identical structures in the Continental and American coals (see p. 191
and fig, 15, Plate 17), which are undoubtedly horizons different from the English
“Bullion Seam.” This alone would be enough to prove that the conditions whic
formed the “coal balls” had occurred more than once in the history of the world, and
that as a consequence all our localities in England where they are found need not
necessarily be of the same age and horizon.

New Horizon at Stalybridge-—We discovered a new locality for the true “coal
balls” and “roof nodules” in a small seam at Stalybridge. The exact position is
