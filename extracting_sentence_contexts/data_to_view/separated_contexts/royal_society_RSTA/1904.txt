Plastics are not only wonderful materials, but they are also a valuable resource, and it seems
nonsensical not to exploit them as such. Clearly, if plastics are sent to a landfill, which large
amounts still are, these plastics are lost as a resource and they do not meet any of the criteria
for the circular economy. In fact, as discussed above, they may start in landfill sites and still cause
environmental damage. Landfill therefore shouldn’t even be an option for dealing with plastics,
they should at the very least be exploited for the chemical reservoir that they contain. If the


polymers can’t be recovered in any way, then they should act as a feedstock for generating other
useful chemicals via chemical recycling or in the last option as a fuel for energy recovery, in the
full understanding that without proper control this energy source will contribute to greenhouse
gases.
