SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF THE MADREPORARIAN TYPES OF CORALS. 301

In the above list I have endeavoured to indicate the main lines of systematic
treatment relative to pre-Triassic and post-Triassic forms. One of the most striking
features is the great richness of the Triassic fauna in members of the Eupsammide,
Astreide, Fungide, and its poverty in those of the Amphiastreide, Turbinolidie,
and Stylinide. This observation goes far to confirm some of my arguments in the
preceding chapter. The “precocity” of the change from bilateral to radial sym-
metry in the Palwozoie Cyathophylloids finds expression in the rich variety of form
attained by their descendants as early as Triassic time. On the other hand, the
tardiness of the change in the Zaphrentoids is consistent with the fact that the
Turbinolide had not attained a steady type even in Jurassic time, and their full
development was postponed until the Middle-Cretaceous age and its favourable
oceanic conditions.

The general resemblance between the recent representatives of Astraide and
Amphiastraide (of diagram, p. 331) which caused them to be placed in one family
(Astreidz), becomes all the more readily understood when the near relationship
of their early ancestors is held in view. I have already referred to Professor
Nicuotson’s indications of genera intermediate between the three sub-divisions which
he made (‘ Manual,’ p. 284) of Paleozoic Madreporaria : Cyathophylloidea, Zaphren-
toidea, Cystiphylloidea. Professor Freon (loc. cit., p. 83) draws attention to the
same feature : “Tt has been frequently pointed out of recent years (amongst others,
