often present, but there has been no distinct alteration in the shape of the grains by
pressure. The individual grains are, in some cases, very irregular in shape and often
come together along more or less crenulated lines, and in No. 24 the peculiar inter-
growth of separate calcite individuals described by Voocr* was observed. The
structure of the limestones and marbles of this class is in fact quite different from
those included in the first list, although they might readily give rise to such rocks as
these, were they subjected to dynamic action under the required conditions.

Tt will thus have been seen that the deformed limestones and marbles met with in
nature, present in many cases at least precisely the structures developed in marble by
artificial deformation. Among these are to be especially noted, in the first place,
cataclastic structure ; and, in the second place, the twisting, elongation, and flatten-
ing of the component calcite individuals either with or without the concomitant
development of twinning and strain shadows, these latter phenomena being almost
invariably seen in the larger individuals but less frequently observed in the very
small grains, apparently on account of the very smallness of their surface. When a
large, highly twinned and strained calcite individual is observed breaking down into
