They also contain degenerating chloroplasts,
which, on account of the enlargement of the cells which contain them, become
widely separated from one another. There is no oil in these intumescences, oil, as
noted above, being most abundant in outgrowths formed wholly or in part of
epidermal cells. But the fact that the normal course of metabolism has been

disturbed is shown by the occurrence in the cells of the affected tissues of numerous
erytalloids of proteid, usually one or more in each cell (figs. 20 and 21). The structure of the outgrowths on the stem of the Potato is essentially the same
as that of the intumescences on the leaves. The normal cortical tissues consist of an
epidermis, below which is a single layer of cells containing chlorophyll.
