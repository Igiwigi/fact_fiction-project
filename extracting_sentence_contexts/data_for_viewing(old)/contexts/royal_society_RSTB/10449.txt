washing needed [12]. Imaging of SNAP-tag fusion proteins in live
E. coli cells has been achieved using quenched SNAP-tag sub-
strates [69]. However, labelling efficiency varied significantly
and a comparably low signal-to-noise ratio was reported [69].
When these substrates were further analysed in eukaryotic cells,
highly unspecific staining of cellular structures was observed
[70]. Altogether, SNAP-tag labelling seems to be a very efficient
and reliable system in eukaryotic cells, however, imaging of live
bacterial cells expressing SNAP-tag labelled proteins still faces
considerable challenges. Nevertheless, a few groups have
achieved SNAP-tag labelling in living bacteria [31,71,72] and con-
tinuous development of fluorescent compounds as reported
recently by Grimm ef al. [73] might in fact increase the amount
of possible applications and make this system more attractive
for the prokaryotic field. Furthermore, specific HALO-tag label-
ling of cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteins in E. coli was quite
recently achieved in a study by Ke et al. [74].

Considerable progress on a fluorescence-activating tag has
been recently achieved by engineering variants of cellular reti-
noic acid binding protein II (CRABPII). CRABPII is a small
protein (15.6 kDa) that belongs to the family of intracellular
lipid-binding proteins and mutants have earlier been shown
to form iminium-based pigment with retinal, thus rendering
a colorimetric pH sensor [75]. Yapici et al. have further
