Some of the belts are specially deserving of attention—for instance
£ the huge shadow 1073 to 1155 of Kircnnopy's scale on my Map ; this shadow or belt
Y stands out like a wall at sunset, and then not only comes into existence itself, but
S with it come 1108, 1114, and 1121, which 7 could not sce 8un high, nor has Kircn-
E HOFP 8hown. 2 6. Tnow turn to another fact. When the autumn has well adyanced here, there springs

up from the plain country, stretching away SE. and 8:W..by W., a kind of haze which
becomes visible at.sunset, and which grows day by day in height until it attains to
perhaps 3” or more aboye the horizon; this haze, moreover, grows denser daily, until at
last it is sufficiently opaque to obscure the sun's rays. I need not in this place enter
into the causes which produce this haze; it is sufficient to remark here that I have
noticed it year after year, and from its opacity and-its formation occurring just before
winter, I always call it © the winter bank;” indeed I remember talking about ,it one
evening with the late Archdeacon Prarr, who also had noticed-it, -in connexion with
8ome other fact.
