The thickened endoderm continued back from the prochordal plate can be traced
on either side of the head-process up to section 27 and, as in the preceding sections,
is fused with the head-process in the median line. Caudally to this section the
thickened endoderm area becomes indistinct, and behind section 34 is certainly no longer
present. The possible explanation of these facts we shall discuss later in connection
with the description of the same region in other human embryos (v. p. 482). Tn section 30 (fig. 34, Plate 32) the head-process has become reduced, both in thickness
and in width, as compared with that of the preceding sections, whilst its cells present
a somewhat looser appearance, and the chromatophilic granules have almost completely
disappeared. The next section (No. 31, fig. 35, Plate 32) presents a very similar
appearance, except that there are no granules and the axial mass is more massive.
