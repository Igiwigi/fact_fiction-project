the notochord in the region of the dise occurs at the onset of ossification (commencement
of the definitiver Zustand), and this he does not attempt to explain. Merely must I
emphasize, in parenthesis, the enormous difference met with in the mouse, where at
the onset of ossification the intervertebral diameter of the notochordal mass has increased
from 0-05 mm. to at least 0-40 mm., while at the same time the centrum mass has long
been devoid of notochordal tissue, excepting the sheath. The persistence of the noto-
chord in the posterior occipital region, where it forms the basis of the lig. apicis dentis,
is an important fact which I have not encountered in the literature.

Nucleus Pulposus.—The early work bearing upon the origin of the nucleus pulposus
is considerable, but also confusing. The evidence brought to light was most unsatis-
factory and it failed to give ground for any settled opinion. . It was thought that the
notochord played some part in the formation of this structure, although the controversy
entered into by LuscuKa, R. Vircnow, Kéniiker, Rosin, Dursy, Lowe and Lesoucg
was centred on the part played by the intervertebral disc, rather than that played by the
notochord. It was generally held that the nucleus pulposus arises by liquefaction of
the tissue of the disc and that the notochord may or may not contribute to its formation.
Gapow (1895) appreciated the confusion and maintained that either such liquefaction
occurs or that the notochordal expansion continues to grow, or that both these facts hold
good. WuU..LIAMs (1908) gave what is probably the most correct account and main-
