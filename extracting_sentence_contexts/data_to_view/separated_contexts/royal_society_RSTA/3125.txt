I have thus omitted consideration of the effects of
aqueous vapour as too large a subject to be included in the present paper. A similar remark applies to wind direction. There are here two main difficulties :
first the fact that the direction is perpetually shifting, and the extent of the variation
in a single day is often large; second the fact that when the wind is light—and there
are few fine weather days when this does not happen sometime during the 24 hours—
the record of direction is often uncertain, the strength of the wind being insutticient to
turn the vane of the Robinson cup anemograph. In particular is this true of foggy
days in winter, the precise days in which the potential tends to be highest.
