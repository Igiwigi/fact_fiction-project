result in injection of a trailing beam. The longitudinal slices oscillating out of phase create a ‘pinch’ : s
feature, which moves longitudinally in the frame of the beam. Where the field of the pinch exceeds 13
the ionization threshold of the HIT (helium), these electrons are ionized, and once injected, their : =

3. Multi-colour beamlets 28
To inject multiple beamlets using B-III, one could take advantage of the fact that the radial size : S]
of each longitudinal slice oscillates with a wavelength of 4g /2. Therefore, if the length of the HIT 4
region, Lyrr, spans multiple lengths of 4g /2, the number of beamlets, N, is given by : z

= bar (3.1)

Ap/2

In other words, given that the ionized electrons satisfy the trapping condition, one can obtain the
same number of bunches as the number of betatron cycles in HIT region. For the plasma density
and electron beam parameters presented in the previous section, 4g/2 ~ 1cm, and therefore the
region of helium impurity of 2cm spans two betatron cycles.
