to the disposition of the scutal valves. It must, therefore, be forced downwards into the
sub-intestinal vessel and so into the gut parenchyma. This means that the blood does not
percolate into the gut parenchyma at a steady pressure, but that it is forcibly injected into
the tissue by the blood pump. The pressure at which this takes place must be considerable,
for from transverse sections it looks as though the lateral vessels would be completely
occluded every time the blood pump contracted.

This second effect of the blood pump is important because of the condition I have
described for Conchoderma auritum. Here the lateral vessel immediately below the scutal
valve forms the sheath of the attrahens muscle. Hence, by contracting this muscle, blood
will be injected into the gut parenchyma with very considerable force indeed.

That the blood forced into the blood parenchyma does in fact pass right through it,
I take to be established on morphological evidence alone. The existence of the scutal valve
and the arrangements of its flap, show conclusively that blood must pass into the lateral
vessel. If blood passes into a vessel, except in the case of erectile tissue (see later, p. 125),
it is obvious that it must also have a way out. Now, since the lateral vessel divides up and
appears to end blindly among the gut parenchyma cells it follows that this parenchyma
must be in fact permeable to the blood.

How the blood actually passes through the parenchyma it is impossible to say. One
thing that is certain is that there is no capillary system joining the ends of the branches of
the subintestinal vessel with the small vessels that open into the epineural sinus (see p. 116).
As I have just stated, the ventral gut vessel simply ends among the parenchyma cells, and
the openings from the parenchyma commence among these same cells. What happens
