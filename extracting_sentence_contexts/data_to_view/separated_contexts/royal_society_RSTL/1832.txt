The Snail having a brain of the same kind as the Bee, and
the medulla spinalis having a similar structure, while the
series of ganglions is wholly wanting, forms one of the most
curious parts of this investigation, Having ascertained that,
in all the animals, the structure of whose nervous system has
been explained in the present Lecture, the brain is a distinct
organ, varying in size it is true, till at last it is scarcely dis-
tinctly visible to the naked eye, but when examined in the
microscope, found to consist of globules and elastic trans-
parent matter, and more or less of a fluid, similar to the brain
of animals of the higher orders ; that there is also at some
distance from the brain, a second substance of similar struc-
ture, connected with the brain by two lateral chords ; and that
this second part gives off the nerves that go to the different
muscular structures of the body ; I consider myself borne
out in the opinion that this part answers the same purpose
as the medulla spinalis. The ganglions which form a chain connected $0 beautifully
together by a double nerve, must be considered to have the
same uses, whatever they are, as the ganglions in the human
body, being equally composed of a congeries of nerves. These are facts, which if they are allowed to be clearly made
out, form an addition to our knowledge, and give confirma-
tion to opinions not before satisfactorily established. 8 Sir EvERarRD HoME on the

Here I hall conclude the present Lecture, neither Mr.
Bavex's time nor my own having admitted of our proceeding
farther in this curious and interesting anatomical investigation,
which I am not without hope, in the course of another year, of
our rendering as complete as microscopical observations admit
of, by examining the neryous system of a class of animals in
which the existence of a brain has not been ascertained,

Till that is done, I must postpone any physiological remarks
connected with the subject, all the facts belonging to it not
having been determined. EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES.
