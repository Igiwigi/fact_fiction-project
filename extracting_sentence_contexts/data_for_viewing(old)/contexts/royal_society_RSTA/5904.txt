are evaluated.

Both observables naturally define a distinguished axis, around which the problem is
rotationally symmetric. In particular, not only are the NSE rotationally symmetric but also their
corresponding action including the conditioning on the observable is invariant under rotation around
this axis. It is therefore intuitive to search for a rotationally symmetric minimizer, and this is
indeed also the nature of the structures that immediately come to mind for vorticity and strain:
strong vorticity will be observed at the core of a particularly strong vortex filament, while large
strain occurs at points such as the centre of the collision of two vortex rings. Of course, it is not
necessarily true that a rotationally symmetric optimization problem has a rotationally symmetric
minimizer.

Because of this fact, we set out to search for multiple, possibly distinct minimizers of the
action: one for which we artificially enforce rotational symmetry, and potentially others for which
no symmetry is enforced. The former case reduces the problem to (2 + 1) dimensions in (r,z, t)
for cylindrical coordinates (r,@,z) in space. In this coordinate system, and using the vorticity-
streamfunction formulation for axisymmetric flows [27], the axisymmetric instanton equations
are
