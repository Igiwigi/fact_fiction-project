In like manner ammonium compounds (Am=N H,) have atomic heats considerably
greater than the corresponding potassium compounds. 'This is seen from the following

97. That undecomposable atoms and atomic groups are contained in compounds with
the atomic heats they have in the free state is further probable from the fact that the
sum of the atomic heats of such atoms, or atomic groups, as when united form a certain
compound, is equal or approximately equal to the atomic heat of this compound. For
many compounds whose elements obey DULONG and PeT1T's law, what has been stated
in < 93 contains the proof that the atomic heat of these compounds is equal to the sum
of the atomic heats of the elementary atoms contained in one atom of the compounds.
That this is also observed when atomic groups are supposed to be united, forming
more complicated compounds, will be seen by bringing forward a few examples. The
atomic heat has been found
