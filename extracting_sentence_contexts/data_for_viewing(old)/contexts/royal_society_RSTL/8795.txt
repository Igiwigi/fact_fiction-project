This and certain relations of bulk in the early-deyeloped organs of the various embryos
considered, determine the deyelopment either by inyagination or by delamination. The
relation of bulk to the process of inyagination I may illustrate from a fact established
in the preceding contributions. In Loligo * the large otocysts each deyelop by a well-
marked inyagination of the epiblast forming a deep pit, which becomes the cavity of
the cyst. In Aplysia the gmaller otocysts each deyelop by a simple yacuolation of the
epiblast without invagination. Again, in Vertebrata. the nerye-cord develops by a long
invagination of the epiblast; in Zuazes and Zumbricus the corresponding nerye-cord
develops by a thickening of the epiblast without any groove and canal of inyagination.

The bulkier structures in these cases are seen. to deyelop by invagination, the smaller
by direct segregation. Inyagination therefore acts as an economy of material, a hollow
mass being produced instead of a solid mass of the same extent.
