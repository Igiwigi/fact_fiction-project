When high-order moments are equilibrated, the
REG-CHM model recovers the behaviour of the SRT-RR approach. The REG-HM and REG-RR
further leads to the standard regularized approach. The latter is explained by the fact that this
configuration (REG) amounts to discarding the non-equilibrium part of populations that are
computed using recursive formulae. In addition, it is confirmed that none of the collision models are able to remove the Mach
number limitation, which was obtained in the linear case, and which is imposed by the lattice
and the equilibrium. In fact, by adopting a different type of equilibrium, e.g. the entropic
formulation obtained by minimizing the H-functional under the constraint of density and
momentum conservation [134], this limitation could be alleviated but at the cost of part of the
physics [76].
