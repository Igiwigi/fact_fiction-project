Fic. 18.â€”-Median view of gnathobases of third and fourth trunk limbs of Moina macrocarpa. The phase difference between the second and first limb is large, and, as the second
appears to move forwards very little, the fact which is most easy to observe is that the
first and third limbs move almost in opposite phase. Under low power it is possible
to watch the first and fifth limbs together and then it can be seen that these two limbs
move even more nearly in opposite phase.
