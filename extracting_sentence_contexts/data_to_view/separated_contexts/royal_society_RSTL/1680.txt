but I am not aware of any direct experi-
ments which have demonstrated its existence, and have there-
fore detailed minutely such researches as I have been enabled
to make upon the subject, hoping at some future period to
render them more complete. The experiments to prove the non-existence of gelatine in
the serum of blood, will, I trust, be deemed sufficiently deci-
sive: they shew that that abundant proximate principle of
animals is not merely separated from the blood, in which it
has been supposed to exist ready formed, but that it is an
actual product of secretion. The proportion of iron afforded by the incineration of seve-
ral varieties of animal coal, is much less considerable than we
have been led to expect, and the experiments noticed in the
fifth section, shew that it is not more abundant in the colour-
ing matter of the blood, than in the other substances which
were submitted to examination ; and that traces of it may be
discovered in the chyle which is white, in the serum, and in
the washed crassamentum or pure fibrina,

The inferences to which I have alluded, in the first section
of this paper, are strongly sanctioned by these -facts, and co-
incide with the opinion which has been laid before the Royal
Society, by Dr. WeLLs,f respecting the peculzar nature of the
colouring principle of the blocd, and support the arguments
which are there adduced,

That the colouring matter of the blood is perfectly inde-
pendent of iron, is, I conceive, sufficiently evident from its

general chemical habitudes, and it appears probable that it
may prove more useful in the art of dycing than has hitherto
been imagined, since neither the alkalies nor the acids (with
the exception of the nitric) have much tendency to alter its
hue. The readiness too with which its stains are removed from
substances to which no mordant has been applied, seem to
render it peculiarly fit for the purposes of the calico-printer,
T have not extended these experiments, nor have I had them
repeated on a sufficient scale to enable me to draw more ge-
neral conclusions respecting the possibility of applying them
with advantage in the arts: this would have led me into too
wide a field, and one not immediately connected with the ob-
Jects of this Society : the subject, however, appears important.
