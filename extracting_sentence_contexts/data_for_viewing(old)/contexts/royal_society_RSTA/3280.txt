Vâ€”AT curve at a critical value of the non-equilibrium parameter AT, which characterizes
this phenomenon as a kinetic transition by the definition of Chernov [16]. Thus, the gathered
experimental results and the theoretical predictions clearly demonstrate that the solidification of
intermetallic phases out of undercooled melts exhibits a kinetic phase transition in the process of
atomic ordering.

(b) Comparison with solute trapping

It is appropriate to compare the growth kinetics with the influence of solute trapping [12,13] and
disorder trapping. Several analogies and one principal difference in these two phenomena can be
outlined.

The first similarity is the fact that both solute trapping and disorder trapping lead to a
metastable microstructure or crystal structure [9,14,33,37]. In this sense, Boettinger & Aziz [6]
developed an early remarkable model for disorder trapping in which, during formation of the
crystal lattice from a liquid, each sublattice captures atoms in a quantity that is not the equilibrium
quantity.

10wing to the use of a diffuse interface, the long-range order parameter 7 decreases to zero within a small interval of
undercooling AT ~ 1K.


The second similarity can be found in the early stages of both phenomena. As shown
experimentally by Eckler et al. [14], the beginning of solute trapping is characterized by a sudden
increase in velocity. The same effect is observed at the beginning of disordered crystal formation
