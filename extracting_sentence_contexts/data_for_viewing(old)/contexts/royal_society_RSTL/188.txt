lographical cube. It is obvious, that, though all its diagonals
would thus be equal, yet one axis parallel to that of the ele-
mentary spheroid would probably have properties different
from the rest. The modifications of its crystalline form would
probably not be alike in all directions as in the usual modifi-
cations of the cube, but would be liable to elongation in the
direction of its original axis. And if such a crystal were elec-
tric, it would have but one pair of poles instead of having four
pair, as in the crystals of boracite.

There is, however, an hypothesis which at least has sim-
plicity to recommend it, and if it be not a just representation
of the fact, it must be allowed to bear a happy resemblance to
truth.

Let a mass of matter be supposed to consist of spherical
particles all of the same size, but of two different kinds in
equal numbers, represented by black and white balls; and
let it be required that in their perfect intermixture every
black ball shall be equally distant from all surrounding
white balls, and that all adjacent balls of the same denomina-
tion shall also be equidistant from each other. I say then,
that these conditions will be fulfilled, if the arrangement be'
cubical, and that the particles will be in equilibrio. Fig. 14
