when placed beneath the solution to be measured, and which in equimolecular
solutions is more dense than the latter, becomes, through these changes, lighter
than and accordingly rises through the overlying solution, with the result that
no boundary can be obtained ; this behaviour is shown with 2 N potassium chloride
solution followed by 2.N copper chloride. According to the relation ¢/c’ = p/p’, the
concentration of the copper solution becomes reduced to 1'2 N, the density of which
= 1°0711, whilst that of 2-0 N potassium chloride = 10886. Hence for this reason
copper chloride, although its density, as calculated from Vatson’s moduli (see
Neryst’s ‘Theoretical Chemistry,’ p. 333), is much greater than that of potassium
chloride, cannot be used as an indicator for the latter from underneath.

Tn addition to the experimental evidence of these concentration changes that has
been given by Masson, further qualitative evidence is found in the fact that in an
experiment in which lithium or magnesium follows potassium in a solution of
potassium chromate, so that there is formed electrolytically a solution of lithium
or magnesium chromate overlying one of potassium chromate, the indicator solution
is seen to be distinctly lighter in colour than the measured.
Since the colour depends only on the anion, this shows the
concentration of the latter is less in the indicator solution.

More direct and conclusive evidence was obtained in the
following manner :—
