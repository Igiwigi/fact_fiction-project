Figure 6. The twisted nematic display.

orthogonal on the two surfaces, a 90Â° twist would be induced, and when the cell
was put between parallel polarizers, no light could pass. However, if a field was
applied across that cell, the molecules would align themselves along the field, the
twist would disappear, and light could pass. Schadt made the cell, it worked, and
the twisted nematic (TN) display was born (figure 6).

There were some curious features to this invention. Helfrich left RCA in
October 1970, made the first TN cells in November, submitted a patent with
Schadt on 4 December (Helfrich & Schadt 1970) and a letter to Applied Physics
Letters 3 days later (Schadt & Helfrich 1971). Such a rapid sequence of conception
and construction is unusual. In fact, as Helfrich admitted 20 years later, he had
thought of the TN effect in 1969, and other ex-RCA staff confirmed this. However,
he made little attempt to attract management interest, since, as he explained, he
was there to help theoretical understanding, not to invent devices. RCA made no
attempt to invalidate the patent or to claim ownership, possibly because there
were further legal complications (Kawamoto 2002).

James Fergason was a scientist who had worked on cholesteric LCs at
Westinghouse in the early 1960s, but left in 1966 to join Kent State University.
Two years later he formed his own company, ILIXCO, to manufacture LC
displays. In 1968 and 1970 he published two papers that effectively contained
descriptions of the TN display (Arora et al. 1968; Fergason et al. 1970). He
made no attempt then to patent the concept, and was surprised, and probably
