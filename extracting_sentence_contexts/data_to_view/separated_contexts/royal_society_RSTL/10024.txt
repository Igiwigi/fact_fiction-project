* It cannot be concluded either from tho result stated above or from the preceding ones that in Dionza,
as in muscle and nerve, the excited part becomes negative to other parts. For it is as consistent with the

facts observed to say that the upper surface becomes positive as the immediate result of excitation, as to

primary, may for many purposes be used more advantageously than any other mode of
excitation, for by means of them a leaf may be snbjected to repeated excitations for
everal hours without failure or appreciable exhanstion. The minimum effectual strength of an opening induction current depends on its
direction, weaker currents being responded to when they are directed downwards than
in the contrary cage.
