tinuous, then the algebraic polynomial part of rz must reduce to zero when 2 = +e,
otherwise its expansion in sines of n7z/e is discontinuous, and at the perimeter
of the flat ends the shear is discontinuous. This introduces infinite stresses at this
point which render the solution inconvenient.

Now we have at our disposal nine constants; these have already been made to
satisfy the seven homogeneous equations (78), (80)-(85), and therefore we are free
to make them satisfy an eighth homogeneous equation.

Choose then the constants so as to make (polynomial part of [du/dz + dw/dr] when
r = a, 2 = +c) zero, and we have

Dae + Ea’c + Fact + Diac+ E'ack=0 . . . . . (86).

Tf now we express all the other constants in terms of the constant E, we find ;
