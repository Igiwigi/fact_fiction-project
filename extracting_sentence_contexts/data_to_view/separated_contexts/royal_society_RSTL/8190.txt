At « we have the hour-glass
bundle accidentally ruptured across its central portion ; at @ we find the large primary
crescentic bundle in its normal position as a single unbroken band. Longitudinal
sections in my cabinet clearly demonstrate that the vessels of this primary crescentic
bundle leave those of the hour-glass one very gradually, since the two sets run for
considerable distances in perfect parallelixm with each other. At aa, ac we find the
two secondary crescentic bundles going off to some secondary lateral appendages, clearly
demonstrating the fact that those appendages, whatever they have been, were alternately
given off from the opposite convexities of the hour-glass bundle. The groove at a" is
