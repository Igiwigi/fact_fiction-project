resemblances are only cases of parallelism in the construction system reduced under
similar conditions of extreme xerophytic environment, as expressed by inefficient
water supply and feeble nutrition, along corresponding lines, as the working out
of certain general elementary principles of morphology.

Most of the earlier stages of development are to be found at the apical region
of a single cone when commencing to flower, and these suffice to bring out several
details of interest, and emphasise the preceding generalisations. The point is to
see if possible where error may have crept in, and to state precisely the actual facts.

An apical region equal to 5 mm, contains all the essential early stages, or even a
shorter piece of 8 mm. On removing such a portion, and picking off the bracts, about
12 pairs of flower-buds will be obtained, in graded sequence to the earliest primordia
just behind the growing point. As in the case of the ovulate cones and their young
flowers, the smallest of these are most readily investigated, owing to their flattened
form and posterior flat side, by clearing them in potash and observing them from the
anterior side, as in the manner adopted for the elevation of the adult flower in the
tangential plane, and a series of figures (about 12 stages) can be readily drawn to
scale to correspond. Similarly, also, sections cut in the longitudinal orthostichy
plane of the cone give a sequence of graded flowers for comparison and measure-
ment; but it is obvious that the fuller view of the flower as a whole is that in
