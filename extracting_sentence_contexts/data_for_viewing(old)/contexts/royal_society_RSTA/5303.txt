(wavelength or power). In the general case, the response of the system is so weak that it can only
be observed by averaging over many realizations. In this case, the system seems to act essentially
as a low-pass filter for the perturbation as illustrated in figure 7.

On the contrary, for adequately chosen perturbation (wavelength tuned to the absorber
resonance as measured previously) and sufficient power, a much larger response takes place.
Although this response cannot be detected in a single shot by standard CCD cameras, the
averaged response is similar in shape and size to a stationary CS. The time-resolved response
is essentially identical to the transient leading to the nucleation of a stable LS, with the exception
that after this transient the system always returns back to the initial state. A typical example
is shown in figure 8a. We define the ‘success rate’ as the ratio between the number of these
large responses and the number of perturbations applied to the system. In figure 8b, we show
the success rate obtained with 20ns long pulses whose average power is 300 \.W. The fact that
the number of responses increases abruptly from 20% to 100% demonstrates the presence of a
threshold separating different kinds of responses.

The existence of a threshold separating linear from excitable responses is a necessary condition
for the system to be qualified as ‘excitable’. The second condition is that the excitable orbit should
be strongly attractive, such that any above-threshold perturbation leads to the same response. In
order to check the uniqueness of the trajectory following a perturbation, we statistically analysed
the time taken by the system to relax back to its original stationary state. The results are shown in
figure 9.

A deterministic time scale clearly appears in the histogram of the response durations, because
no return trajectory has a duration shorter than 100ns. Together with the threshold shown in
