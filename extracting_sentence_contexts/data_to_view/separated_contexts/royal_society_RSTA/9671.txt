Also, it is curious that the first
sets of triplets apparently have the lines corresponding to the second separation
displaced below those forming the first. Thus in Ca the second set (giving », = 13°5)
have not been observed, in Sr the two (», = 101, » = 60) are separated by a gap of
143, and a similar effect will be found later in Ba. Owing to this fact, the formule
constants are calculated from the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th sets. They give for F,,—
