In the neighbourhood of a true equilibrium state where thermodynamic fluxes and forces
vanish simultaneously, the phenomenological relationships between these quantities are in
good approximation given by linear laws. Furthermore, the famous Theorem of Onsager [36,37] =
then applies. It expresses the relationship between detailed balance at the macroscopic level” : 3
and the fact that the fundamental equations governing the motion of individual particles are
symmetric with respect to past and future, ie. that they are mathematically invariant under mea)
the transformation of time f + (—f). Accordingly, the number of independent phenomenological :
constants linking linearly thermodynamic fluxes and forces is drastically reduced owing to the [4
validity of the so-called Onsager reciprocity relations. Finally, these combined approximations DN
yielded the so-called Thermodynamics of irreversible processes, also now called Linear non-equilibrium 2S
thermodynamics.
