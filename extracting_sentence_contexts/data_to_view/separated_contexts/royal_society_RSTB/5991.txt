The palatine nerves always run ventrally to
the basitrabecular process.

7. The Pila Antotica.—In the fully-formed chondrocranium of the bird, e.g., in the
fowl (Tonxorr, 1900), the posterior orbital cartilage is attached to the basal plate by
a cartilaginous pillar which passes between the profundus and the maxillary branches
of the trigeminal nerve. This condition is explained by the fact that an ‘additional
support, the pila antotica spuria, is developed in this position. A complete series can
thus be made out, fig. 24, from such a form as the crocodile, which possesses a pila
antotica (p.a.), and no pila antotica spuria (p.a.s.) ; here, as always, all the branches of
the trigeminal nerve pass out behind the pila antotica, fig. 24, A. At young stages,
fig. 24, B, the duck is precisely similar to the crocodile, and the pila antotica is typical.
