Unlike most arc spectra which consist of lines all of much the same character, the copper
spectrum is a mixture of a relatively small number of sharp lines in a mass of diffuse lines of
all sorts of widths and shapes. Most of the diffuse lines cannot be sharpened by the usual
device of using a low pressure and field-free source. In such a source they simply disappear
while retaining their width. These characteristics have been described in detail by Allen
(1932), and the explanation is, of course, that the line-widths are inherent in the levels
which give rise to them, due to auto-ionization.

Accurate measurements of diffuse lines cannot be expected. Moreover, in a spectrum as
dense as that of copper, there must be much overlapping of wide lines which no device can
resolve. Such observational difficulties impose definite restrictions on the analysis of the
spectrum, and they are hardly counterbalanced by the fact that the line widths are a guide
in judging the reality of a level. In a spectrum of sharp lines accurately measured, like iron,
the numerical accuracy of the combinations is of primary importance, but in copper a
much more detailed study of the characteristics of the spectrum is necessary.

The wave-lengths used are derived from several sources. The most accurate measures
are those made by Burns & Walters (1929) with the interferometer. They are the basis of
the numerical analysis of most of the sharp levels. Next in accuracy are some of the values
given by Hetzler, Boreman & Burns (1935) and the measures made at M.I.T., and included
in the M.I.T. wave-length tables. In the infra-red, measures made by Kiess (1935) have

been used. The remaining lines, of which there are a great many, are the result of my own
