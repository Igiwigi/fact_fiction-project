Although this background may be largely
# eliminated by means of the desensitization technique, this process necessarily involves the
§ inhibition of some, at least, of the proton tracks present, and therefore of protons which
5 may be emitted in the fission process. However, the results of the counting experiments
E indicated that the particles were probably «-particles, and the tracks of these are not inhibited
© by moderate desensitization. In view of these facts, it was decided to search for particles,
heavier than protons, emitted in the fission process. Accordingly, the investigation was
carried out in plates which were fully sensitive to e-particles and only partially sensitive to
protons; these conditions were realized in C 2 plates impregnated with 0-5 and 1% uranyl
acetate solutions. The preliminary work was carried out using plates with emulsion coatings 20, thick.
