interactively generated as well as apprehended.

Social interaction processes can be very hard to disentan-
gle from individual brain and body dynamics. They can also
play specific functional roles in the solution of a cognitive
task. And they can give rise to objects, meanings and actions
that are irreducibly interactive. These complex realities in no
way eliminate the possibility of scientific inquiry. On the con-
trary, in some cases they result in simpler explanations than
those that are unduly constrained to be skull-bound, as we
witness in the case of escalation and perceptual crossing.
Far from making social cognition fuzzier and mysterious,
the IBH in fact seeks to provide a more objective foundation,

one that is more amenable to scientific observation and
experimental manipulation.

My co-authors are correct in taking me to reject the possi-
bility, not just the plausibility, of the IHB in what I wrote in
ยง3. However, this depends on three concepts, whose relations
were argued for only in the vaguest terms; let me say a bit
more about them here in responding to the arguments of
ยง4. The three concepts are cognition, causation and explana-
