AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE FOSSIL REPTILIA. 195

The sclerotic circle—Below the orbit a structure exists which closely resembles the
sclerotic armature of a Bird (Plate 15), which, when complete, may have approached a
diameter of 2 centims. A circle of this size might have been contained in the orbit.
It is inflated in the middle part, in the centre of which appears to be a smooth space of
matrix ; externally its border is concave. It appears to be formed of radiating thin
plates in close contact; but the state of preservation does not admit of detailed
description or absolute identification, for the mass may possibly be dermal armour.

The bones of the palate.—The bones of the palate are scattered. Their identifica-
tion rests upon, first, the forms of the bones; secondly, their consecutive positions ;
and thirdly, the fact that the vomer, palatine, and pterygoid all carry minute teeth;
while there can be no suspicion that these elements belong to the lower jaw, since
the lower jaw is preserved.

Vomer.—Both vomerine bones are indicated, and both are partly imbedded in the
matrix. They were very slender, 3 centims. long, and about 2 millims. wide where
widest proximally. They carried minute teeth, densely placed along the margin.
The crowns are enamelled, enlarged and pointed, with lanceolate form.

Palatine bone.—The palatine bone is a long triangle, notched out on the inner
anterior margin for the reception of the vomer. The bone is 3°2 centims. long, and
8 millims. wide posteriorly, tapering away in front. The external border is straight.
The posterior border is straight and truncated, but rounds into the inner side, which
