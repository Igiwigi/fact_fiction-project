in groups with more males [187], suggesting that association
patterns are also sensitive to variation in ASR. A sudden
change in ASR in a baboon group due to the death of half of
the adult males from tuberculosis also led to a more relaxed
dominance hierarchy and an increase in male-female affilia-
tion [188]. Because this pacific culture persisted after the
ASR returned to values before the outbreak, a causal role of
the change in ASR is not established, however. Thus, patterns
of inter-sexual association, affiliation and aggression appear
to be sensitive to ASR variation, but more research is clearly
indicated to substantiate these relationships.

A final point relates to the fact both sexes might derive
benefits from a biased ASR. Males not only benefit from an
increase in the number of potential mates, but females may
also derive direct fitness benefits from an increase in the
number of males in their group. These benefits are primarily
related to the risks of infanticide and predation and therefore
also affect male-female relations in the context of sexual selec-
tion. First, additional males, especially in modally single-male
groups, can reduce the risk of takeover and subsequent infan-
ticide by outside males [137], thereby also providing a direct
benefit to females with dependent infants. Second, additio-
nal males afford better protection from predators through a
combination of mechanisms, and with increasing predation
