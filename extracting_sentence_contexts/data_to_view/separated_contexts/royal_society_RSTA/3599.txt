Marketing focuses on
how people justify these acquisitions, and packages their products to make clear how deserving
you are to commit this one additional act of consumption [6]. The interplay between wealth and
increased consumption has been written about extensively [7,8] diagnosed and analysed [9,10]
with the pathological consequences documents [11] yet little changes in these patterns of human
acquisitiveness. In fact, Adam Smith’s famous ‘invisible hand’ justifies these potential excesses
as a virtue [12]. These basic impulses greatly complicate any attempt to modify our consumption
and to turn society away from increased consumption. The result of these complex interactions has been a steady growth in materials used by human
society.
