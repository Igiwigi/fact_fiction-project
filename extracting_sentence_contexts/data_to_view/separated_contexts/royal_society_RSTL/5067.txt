FseLLexnBERG has published* results which lead also to the conclusion, that
either nitrites or nitrates are formed in treating hydrate of lime with ozonized atmo-
spheric air, and the same chemist has made observations with the phosphatic acid
coinciding with the results I have obtained from my own experiments. The philo-
sopher of Lansanne is rather inclined to identify ozone with hyponitric acid. I think,
however, that such an opinion cannot be upheld, and is contrary to facts, of which I
gave an account in Poc@enDoRFF's Annals some time ago. According to my expe-
riments, 0zone destroys instantaneously hyponitric acid, hydrate of nitric acid being
formed. Phosphorus does not shine in atmospheric air containing the smallest
quantity of hyponitric acid, whilst phosphorus exhibits a very lively disengagement
of light when placed in atmospheric air, being ever s0 strongly charged with ozone.
