The spiracles—There are ten pairs of functional spiracles in the third-stage flea
larva and thus it is of the holopneustic type. Two pairs belong to the thorax and
eight pairs to the first eight abdominal segments. The mesothoracic spiracles (fig. 55,
t.s.1.) have shifted forwards so as to come to lie in the posterior portion of the pro-
thoracic tergum, and they have wrongly been called by previous workers pro-
thoracic spiracles, as it is a well-known fact that the prothoracic spiracles are com-
pletely absent in larval or adult insects. Their peculiar location, namely, in the
posterior half of the prothorax, suggests that they have migrated forwards from the
following segment, as all the remaining spiracles are found in the anterior half of
the segment to which they belong. According to Kerutn (1924, b, p. 127), the primitive position of spiracles ofan insect
is the anterior intersegmental membrane of the segment to which they belong, as
the ten pairs of spiracles of an insect can only possibly correspond to the ten inter-
segmental spaces of the eleven spiracle-bearing segments of the body.
