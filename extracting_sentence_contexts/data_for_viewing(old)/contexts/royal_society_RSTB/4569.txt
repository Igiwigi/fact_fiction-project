of the following lengths were taken: 9, 9, 11, 16, 16, 16, 21 mm., #.e., an average of
14 mm., and another (Station 793, 11/6, 1914) yielded eleven specimens averaging
18°1 mm. in length.


192 DR. J. SCHMIDT ON THE BREEDING PLACES OF THE EEL.

On returning from the West Indies we set about endeavouring to get another
schooner to work in place of the ‘‘ Margrethe,” but then came the Great War, and all
plans for further researches at sea had to be laid aside. The work of the trading
vessels, however, was maintained during the first years of the War, and continued to
yield valuable information. In 1915, for instance, we obtained confirmation of the
fact that tiny larvee occur in summer, and a sample taken at the end of September,
1915, contained eight specimens of about 34 cm. long, ¢.¢., of the same size as those
taken by the ‘‘ Margrethe” in the autumn of 1913. As the War increased in extent,
however, our collecting work died out, and several of the vessels which had been
assisting us were sunk by submarines. During the next five years, therefore, from 1915
to 1920, the investigations at sea were altogether at a standstill ; I was able, how-
ever, on the basis of material from the western Atlantic, to work out a description of
the development of the larvee of the two Anguilla species and a series of other
Atlantic murenoids (1916).* The larvee of the European eel were now known in all
stages of development, from that of 9 mm. up to full-grown larvee averaging 7$ cm. in
length, and in their metamorphosic stages. I was also able to describe the develop-
ment and metamorphosis of the larvee of the American eel, which proved to be
considerably smaller—1 em. at least—than that of the European, in a fully grown state.
