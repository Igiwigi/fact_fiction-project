can be placed upon the mere appearance of crystals; they must be submitted to
recrystallisation by sublimation or 80me other process. The physiological action of
certain alkaloids of an extremely deadly character is remarkable enough to prove a
means of identifying the snbstance when the effect, on the human 8nhject is under
observation ; but ib is to 80me extent capable of being modified by the extent of the
dose, the administration of other drugs, or the idiosyneracy of the patient. These
facts are well known, and are generally made use of by the counsel for the defence in
medico-legal cases. When the identification of an alkaloid is a necessary part of the
evidence of the administration of poison, experiments of a physiological character have
necessarily to be made on the lower animals. It has been objected that the action of
drugs on creatures of a smaller size and different organisation may be, and, in certain
cases, indeed is, unlike that produced in the human organism, and comparative experi-
ments are necessary in which the suspected 8ubstance is compared with authentic
specimens before its identity can be establisghed. But in 8uch comparative experi-
ments an element of uncertainty is introduced, because various preparations supposed
to be the same alkaloid may differ in physiological action to snch an extent that
reasonable doubts may be entertained as to whether they consist of the same substance
or, indeed, of one substance only. The whole subject of the modification of alkaloids
