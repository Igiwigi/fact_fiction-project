THE NITRIFYING PROCESS AND ITS SPECIFIC FERMENT. 125

APPENDIX. Although in the experiments recorded above we have uniformly found that the
pure nitrifying solutions yielded no growth in gelatine-peptone, we have by no means
abandoned the hope of cultivating the nitrifying organism on this and possibly on
other solid media. Thus, in our most recent experiments we find that on inoculating from the pure
nitrifying solutions into broth, the latter develops after a considerable time (about
twenty days at the ordinary temperature), a very characteristic growth, the liquid
becomes turbid, a very thin whitish pellicle forms on the surface, and afterwards a
considerable amount of glutinous deposit collects on the bottom, the whole liquid in
fact becomes highly viscous and adheres to a needle in long strings. On microscopic examination, this growth is seen to consist of small bacilli, about
15 in length, and about ‘5p in breadth, sometimes, however, forming threads (5°7p
in length) in which the divisions are generally not apparent, but sometimes the
divisions were sufficiently discernible to show that these threads were really made up
of four or five individuals hanging together, end to end. The accompanying drawing shows the appearance of the organism taken from a

broth-cultivation.
