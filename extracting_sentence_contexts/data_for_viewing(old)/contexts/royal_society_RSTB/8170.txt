occasionally grades into calcareous sandstone.

The limestone has been extensively altered by lateritization, as described in the pre-
ceding section. In addition, it is often stained red by haematite without complete removal
of calcium carbonate. This is most noticeable where the limestone overlies Bringo Shale,
with springs issuing at the contact. At these places the limestone is bright red near the
base and unreplaced fossils are abundant. The haematite is thought to have been secondarily
introduced by circulating ground water close to the contact with the impervious Bringo
Shale.

Distribution and thickness. Unaltered Newmarracarra Limestone has a very limited dis-
tribution in the Geraldton district, by far the most extensive outcrops being found in the
area mapped in detail (figure 1). Elsewhere, outcrops are very sporadic, owing to the fact
that over a large part of the area the limestone is completely altered by lateritization.
Owing to this irregular alteration, the thickness of limestone cropping out is very variable,
the thickest exposures being near Round Hill (the type section), where up to 33 ft. of
unaltered limestone is exposed. Elsewhere the formation is invariably altered to some

calcium carbonate. Because of the irregular leached zone, which causes compaction of
