It must be taken into account in picturing the
probable growth of the plant, and the reconstruction suggested by Krausel & Weyland
(1935) requires amendment in the light of it. It is as regards this branching and the
recognition of the fertile shoots in Britain that the Llanover material has added to our
knowledge. But further, the fact that this widely distributed plant is established as a
member of the Senni Beds flora is of stratigraphical significance.

Pieces of stem and branch systems bearing projecting spines, or marked by the places
of insertion of spines, were fairly abundant at Llanover.
