[30,31], for example if he is a burden rather than someone
who will reliably invest in offspring. We have previously
shown that it is the women in female-biased areas and
women of low SES who start reproducing early in this popu-
lation, often without the support of a partner [11]. Because
abortion is illegal in Northern Ireland, risky (unprotected)
sex, which has been shown to be more common in female-
biased areas [18], might lead to early parenthood for these
women more often than if abortion were legal and more
easily accessible.

Some of the asymmetries between the male and female
cohabitation models are likely to be explained by the fact
that men in female-biased areas could opt for women
younger than the age cut-off at 25 years that we used in
these analyses. Women in female-biased areas might accept
a man with relatively low SES (even in male-biased areas) if
these costs are outweighed by the perceived benefits
