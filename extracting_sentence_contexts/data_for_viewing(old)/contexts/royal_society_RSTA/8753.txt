the moving magnetic pole is thus to all intents and purposes equal to

an expression which agrees with that suggested by the relativity transformation.
It must, however, be noted that the local term is necessary in the complete relation
defining the vector A, for the simpler relation
Curl A, = E,
carries with it the consequence that
div E=0
at all points of the field, and this is true only of those points where there is no
electricity.
The expression for the forcive on the magnetic media is now attainable by regarding
it as the resultant of the forces on its contained poles ; for the volume v bounded by
the closed surface f, it is in fact

— | (div 1) Bde [1B af

= | [4 +e Curl [Ip,.], E+ E.| dv

+ |CC(I)m), E+E) df

The second and fourth integrals transform by GREEN’s lemma to the volume
integrals :
|(B(VI)+(IV) B) dv— |[[Curl [Iy,,] E+E,]+grad ([Iv,.] E+E,)

= —([b,,] div (E+E,)| de,
