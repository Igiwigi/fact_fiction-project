each is the result of changes in temperature and the method of calculating the correction
is the same.

(a) The loss in the second vessel.—Before discussing this it is well to point out that
the elucidation of the cause of the second vessel loss is of considerable importance ; for
should the magnitude of this loss turn out to be proportional to the total loss (as we
at one time thought it to be) then our method of determining vapour densities

is limited in accuracy to about 1 per cent. (see the second vessel loss in the benzene
experiments). In fact it was this fear that compelled us to devote a very large part
of the time spent on this research to experiments devised to find out the cause.

When we have two vessels charged with the same liquid. the second vessel always lost
weight. This phenomenon has already been reported to the society.* In the appendix
to that communication it was tentatively ascribed to a local small difference in the
temperature of the bath. Later experiments where the two vessels were placed in
different positions in the train, and others with the direction of the air current reversed
seemed conclusively to rule out a temperature gradient in the bath ; but it still remained
possible that the air on leaving the first vessel is cooled by the latent heat of evaporation
and only attains the bath temperature when it enters the second vessel. ‘This hypothesis
is negatived both by calculation and by experiments where the air speed is greatly
reduced (indeed in the latter case the second vessel loss was markedly increased). There
