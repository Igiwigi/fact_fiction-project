To estimate then the weight which we may attach to these results, let us &ee how
tar the experiments are consistent with one of the rival theories.

Now the equation to the surface of wave 8lowness in the theories of Gretx and
Cavouy involves more constants than the three principal refractive indices of the
crystal.

SS To determine these we must make the principal sections agree with experimental
aresults in more points than the extremities of the axes; and it is probable, therefore,
Sthat they will differ but little throughout.

I In fact, the existence of these unnecessary constants is a radical defect in both these
= theories.

E Lord RavLeGn, however, has proposed a theory in which the only constants are
Zthe prineipal velocities (Phil. Mag., vol. 41, series 4, 1871).

S The shape of the surface of wave slowness is also considerably different from that
<= given by FresNEL's theory.

S Its principal sections consist of a circle and the inverse of an ellipse instead of a
Seirelo and an ellipse.
