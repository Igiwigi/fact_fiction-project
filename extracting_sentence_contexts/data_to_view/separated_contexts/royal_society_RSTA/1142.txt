Tf T be assumed constant, the equation takes approximately
the form

a form which numerically ean be closely fitted by a pressure-index law.* If allowance
be made for the fact that under closed vessel conditions the temperature at the start
is lower than the mean gas temperature during the explosion, the values so derived
can be made to conform to numerical values given by the expression

_p4f_ Da = A+ Bp,

where A is small. The quantity usually written @ in the first of these three approxi-
mations (the form in most general use) is in effect equal to

BT,

iD (i a a -p)
and it will be seen that this quantity, other things being equal, increases with decreases
in T and in p.
