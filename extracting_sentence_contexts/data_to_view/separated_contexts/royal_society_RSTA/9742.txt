The square Q is divided in this case not by eight, but by sixteen
lines, viz., those whose equations are s = 8, +9, $= s,+(n+e€); t= s+, t=s,+(y+6)
(a, 8=1, 2). By giving and B all possible values in the equations just written, it
will be seen that we obtain four sets of eight, for each of which we can distinguish a
square 3 bounded by the lines s = s, + 9, ¢ = 8, -+ 7; moreover, these squares will
evidently have borders d,, of width «. It is not difficult to see that, in those parts
of Q which are exterior to the borders d,, (#, 8 = 1, 2), we have either

Bon (85 81) = 9. (83 2) = 0,
9.4 (t5 81) = 8.4 (t5 82) = 05+

or

en
that in the square q,, we have
Be (s5 Sa) = 6... (t; 8) = 1,
Do. (85 83-0) = 9, (5 83-9) = 05

* The reader may compare this with the fact that, when we have a quadratic form which only assumes
non-negative values, and we put all the variables save one (say 7) equal to zero, we deduce that the
coefficient of 2,2 must be = 0.

+ Both these pairs of equalities will hold in certain parts of the square, but we only require that at
least one of them should be true. AND THEIR CONNECTION WITH THE THEORY OF INTEGRAL EQUATIONS. 423

and that in the border d,, the last pair of equations still hold, but 0.,, (8; s.), Os (65:34)
are each less than, or equal to, unity. From this it appears that the function
[210,,, (83 81) + 236,, (83 8s)] [214,, 4 (¢; $1) + t20.,5 (¢3 S5)] = 2.2, 10 Gea (e@, 8 = 1, 2),
= 0 outside the borders d,,,

and that in the border d,, its modulus is = | a,5|.
