G. FILON ON THE ELASTIC EQUILIBRIUM OF

The system of frictional shears required to prevent the ends expanding will be
towards the centre: the parts of the material round the centre will therefore be
depressed, and the compressing planes (supposed rigid) will have to compress
the outer portions more than the inner, if the cross-section is to retain its original
plane form, i.c., remain in contact with the compressing planes throughout. It is
thus not surprising that the greatest pressure should be at the perimeter, being in
fact nearly 24 times the pressure at the centre. Diagram 9.—Showing Stress é@ for Cylinder com- Diagram 10.—Showing Stress v2 for Cylinder com-
