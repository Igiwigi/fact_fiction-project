No hypothesis respecting the disposition of the stars to rest or to motion is involved.
The apparent proper motions are the results of the comparison of the catalogues, and

the question proposed by Sir W. HerscueL was simply to determine the point
towards which the sun must be supposed to move, in order that, after deducting the
parallactic effect, the amount of the residual motions might be the least possible.
Burknarv1's memoir was published in the Connaissance des Temps for 1809. It
contains formula for the solution of the problem, with their application to several of
the stars in MAsKELYNE's catalogue ; but he found little accordance among the results,
and concluded that we are not yet in possession of a sufficient number of facts to
decide on the direction of the sun's motion.

Bior, in the Additions to his Astronomie Physique, also considered the question
of the translation of the planetary system, and gave formulz for determining the
right ascension and declination of the solar apex. He computed the intersections of
the great circles containing the arcs described by eight stars, viz. Aldebaran, Capella,
Sirius, Procyon, Pollux, Arcturus, « Lyra, and « Aquilz, the proper motions of which
were given by Zacn from a comparison of Brapuey's places with those of Masks-
LYNE, and also of the catalogues of Mayer and Prazzi. If the apparent motions
depended solely on the displacement of our system, the intersections would, of course,
all be found at the same two points of the sphere ; but he found the discrepancies to
be s0 great that he considered them to be irreconcileable with the supposition of their
