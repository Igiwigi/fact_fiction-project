FROM THE CARBONIFEROUS ROCKS OF AUSTRALIA. 5

were discovered. Although not found in situ the fossil bore no signs of transport, and
the colour and mode of preservation were so nearly identical with that of the newly
discovered specimens that it might very well have been a fragment of one of these.
There now seems scarcely any doubt that it belongs to the same geological horizon.
Tn this specimen the stem was not preserved, but a dozen finger-thick petioles, embedded
in a packing of adventitious roots, had their bundles rather regularly orientated ; it
was concluded that the leaves had been preserved in their natural positions with respect
to the missing “ stem,” which no doubt was erect. ‘The facts suggested, at the time, the
picture of a tree-fern of medium size with a single central axis surrounded by a thick zone
of leaf-bases in several cycles. The fossil was apparently a part of this peripheral zone.

From an examination of this specimen, which is the only one yet figured or fully
described, it thus seemed obvious that C. australis was “ a fair-sized tree-fern resembling
the fossil Osmundacew.”* This, I believe, has been the commonly accepted view as to
the constitution of the stem in this plant ; and this view was strengthened by a com-
parison with Asterochlena and with the Siberian form C. kirgisica of which Stenzett
figured a cross-section showing part of an apparently solitary central axis surrounded by
a thick zone of petioles. However, as already stated, the stem-organisation as revealed
by the newly discovered specimens was in reality very different from that of an ordinary
tree-fern.
