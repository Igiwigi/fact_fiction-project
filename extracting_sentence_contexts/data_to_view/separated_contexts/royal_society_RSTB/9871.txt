Here we assessed the role of task
difficulty in learning preference by presenting participants
with a task labelled as ‘easy’ or ‘hard’. Recent work by
Mesoudi [24] with adults lies in contrast to the predictions
above. In a complex artefact-design task, approximately
three-quarters of adults chose to learn asocially rather than
socially, despite the complexity of the task and the fact

there was a financial reward for success. These adults’ prefer-
ences for asocial learning are a stark contrast with the rate of
social learning described above for young children; this
difference may be because in Mesoudi’s experiments adults
were in the position to choose which learning style they
drew upon, or may be developmental. This study includes
two child samples and an adult sample to investigate
whether and, if so, how preferences for asocial or social learn-
ing change over the lifespan.
