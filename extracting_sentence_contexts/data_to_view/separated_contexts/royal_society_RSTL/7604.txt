I do not at present pursue the question.

22. For a surface having a bitrope B'=1, it appears from what precedes, that the
oscular line must count 4 times in the intersection of the surface with the Hessian ; for
only in this way can the reduction 4 in the order of the spinode curve arise.

23. The pinch-point, or singularity j=1, is in fact mentioned in Sa1aoN; it is a point
on the nodal curye such that the two tangent planes' coincide, or say it is a cuspidal
point on the nodal curye. If, to fix the ideas, we take the nodal curye to be a complete
intersection P=0, Q=0, then the equation of the surface is (A, B, CYP, Q)*=0
(A, B, © functions of the coordinates) ; we have a swrface AC—B*=0, which may be
called the critic surface, intersecting the nodal curve in the points P=0, Q=0,
AC—B*=0, which are the pinch-points thereof; or if there be a cuspidal curve, then
such of these points as are not, situate on the cuspidal curve are the pinch-points: see my
