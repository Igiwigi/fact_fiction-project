development of the embryo itself does not commence until after the seed has fallen.§
None of the cones of Welwitschia that have been examined have attained their full
size, but the most fully developed pro-embryos seen (fig. 85) are not confined to the
largest ovules studied. It is therefore quite possible that here, as in Gnetum, the
embryo develops in the fallen seed before germination. The only seeds that have
been available for examination which contained large and fully developed embryos
were lying on the ground and had probably been in that condition for six months.
All are agreed that, of the three living genera, Ephedra is the most nearly allied to
the lower Gymnosperms. If the group is monophyletic, it is not a little remarkable
that its highest members should, in the deferred development of the embryo, have
reverted to conditions so characteristic of primitive seed-bearing plants.

Beyond the fact that in Gnetum the oospore elongates to form a tubular suspensor, we
have little information as to the early changes following fertilisation.|| It is probable
that, as in Ephedra and Welwitschia, a primary suspensor with an initial cell at its
tip is formed, as a result of the first division of the oospore-nucleus, though BowEr
states that no terminal cell is cut off before germination.1 This tubular suspensor is

described as occasionally undergoing branching, a condition which has not been met
with in Welwitschia. After the appearance of a few anticlinal walls in the terminal
cell of the pro-embryo, “the peripheral cells of the group thus formed grow laterally
along the surface of the suspensor and, dividing further by anticlinal walls, form short
