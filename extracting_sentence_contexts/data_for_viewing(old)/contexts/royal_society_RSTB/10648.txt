counting that compares the expected to observed density of
sightings in each range. When M. jelskii was excluded from
analyses, the evidence for association between sightings
and ranges remained robust (p < 0.001). The estimated inten-
sity of sightings (spatial intensity) also strongly supported the
plausibility of our proposed prawn habitat ranges (electronic
supplementary material, figure S1).

Consistent with our hypothesis, the overall odds of schisto-
some infection increased within dammed catchments, with the
highest increases overall among dams situated within native
prawn habitat (figure 1, red diamonds). This effect was statis-
tically supported by the fact that odds ratios for after:before
dam building differed significantly among the three scenarios
(p < 0.0001)—i.e. among (i) catchments within prawn habitat,
(ii) undammed watersheds, and (iii) catchments outside prawn
habitat. Those catchments located within prawn habitat had
overall ORs after:before of 2.8 (2.7—2.9 Cl) for S. haematobium
and 4.4 (3.6-5.3 CI) for S. mansoni, (figure 1, red diamonds),
demonstrating a strong overall increase in schistosomiasis.
By contrast, undammed watersheds in nearby prawn habitat
experienced overall schistosomiasis declines across the same
time periods — ORs after:before 0.90 (0.88—0.91 CI) for S. haem-
atobium and 0.75 (0.73-0.78 CI) for S. mansoni (figure 1, red
diamonds). The dammed catchments outside prawn habitats
