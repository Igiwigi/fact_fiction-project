separated from group 3 by the intervening f-block.

In spite of the highly uneven shape that this produces and the fact that such splitting of blocks
does not occur in other blocks in the periodic table, a surprising number of such tables have
appeared!Â°. For example, the version of the periodic table shown in figure 13 was featured as the
logo of the Inorganic Chemistry Division of the American Chemical Society until recently when
it was withdrawn specifically because of the controversies concerning group 3.

The fourth possible presentation is one that abstains from specifying which elements belong in
group 3 or rather it is a presentation that only contains two elements, scandium and yttrium, as
being definitely in group 3. This table is sometimes labelled as the official IUPAC periodic table

10One minor exception to this statement is the fact that the s-block is split just in the case of the first two members, hydrogen
and helium, at least in the way that the periodic table is generally depicted with helium in group 18.
