action of the inclined plane on the moving mass, like that of the resistance of the water
on the stone, has this property—that, while it is incapable of exerting any but the
smallest force to hold the body absolutely at rest, it exerts a retarding force upon it in
uniform motion, equal to that of gravity. The objections above mentioned against the
sliding of glaciers have arisen from an entire misconception of this kind of mechanical
action.

9. At the period when the preceding experiment was published, I was disposed to
think that the greater part of the observed motion of the surface of a glacier was due
to the general motion, by sliding, of the whole mass, while it was contended by other
glacialists that it was principally due to an excess of the velocity of the upper strata
of the mass over that of its lower strata, due to a gradual change of form of the whole
mass, and that there might in fact be no sliding movement at all. In recognizing that
both these causes might be ver® caus@ *, L urged the necessity of deciding on their relative
claims by actual observations, which should determine the velocities of the upper and
lower surfaces of a glacier at 8ome point where the lower one was accessible. Observa-
