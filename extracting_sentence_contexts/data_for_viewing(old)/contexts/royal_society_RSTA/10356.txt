Miss Gares* showed that this active matter was volatilized from a platinum wire
above a red heat and deposited on the surface of a cold cylinder surrounding the wire.
Curre and DANNE extended these results by subjecting an active platinum wire for a
short time to the action of temperatures varying between 15° C. and 1350° C., and
then examining at room temperatures the decay curves not only for the active matter
remaining on the wire, but also for the volatilized part. They found that the
activity of the distilled part always increased after removal, passed through a
maximum, and finally decayed according to an exponential law (half value in
28 minutes). At a temperature of about 630° C. the active matter left behind on
the wire decayed at once according to an exponential law, falling to half value in
28 minutes. P. Curre and Danner showed that the matter B is much more volatile
than C. The former is completely volatilized at about 600° C., while the latter is
not completely volatilized even at a temperature of 1300° C. The fact that the
matter ©, left behind when B is completely volatilized, decays at once to half value
in 28 minutes shows that the matter C itself and not B is half transformed in
28 minutes.

Curte and DANN# also found that the rate of decay of the active matter varied
with the temperature to which the platinum wire had been subjected. At 630° C.
the rate of decay was normal, at 1100° C. the activity fell to half value in about
20 minutes, while at 1300° C. it fell to about half value in about 25 minutes.

I have repeated the experiments of Curte and Danne and obtained very similar
results. It was thought possible that the measured rate of decay observed after
heating might be due to a permanent increase in the rate of volatilization of C at
