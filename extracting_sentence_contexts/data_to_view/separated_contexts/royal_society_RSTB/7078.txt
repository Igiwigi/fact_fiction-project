Just below the apex of the bud; the vascular tissue of the parental leaf p has faded out. P, stands in an approximately normal phyllotactic relation to p. (Semi-diagrammatic, x 40.) Although isolated leaf primordia are capable of further growth, this is usually inextensive ;
active growth, in fact, becomes localized in the axillary bud. This bud growth is in marked
contrast to that in normal plants; there the bud has only a small protostelic strand passing
through the cortex of the parent plant, whereas in the materials under consideration the
bud may be solenostelic from the outset, and may soon become dictyostelic, e.g. figures
35 to 37. VoL. 233.
