nutrition ? Would upholders of this hypothesis further claim that dietary regime
will account for the total loss of wings in the sterile castes, and also for the fact that
in many species the members of those castes have lost all trace of eyes ? Summarising the foregoing portion of this chapter, I maintain that there is no
satisfactory evidence conclusively proving that any particular type of nutrition, or the
absence thereof, is capable of producing such fundamental changes in the external
and internal morphology which characterise the soldier caste. It has also been shown
that the reduction in the gonads is not an invariable attribute of the soldier, and that
caste production is not in any way related to the presence of intestinal Protozoa.
