MarertAL. Zinda Pir section: White Marl Band (local zone 11) (FB. F. 2734, the holotype,
Reg. No. L. 79887, and 12 topotypes, Reg. No. L. 79888-93).
Description. Shell of large size, smooth except for growth lines, internally subnacreous,
subequivalve, flattened, slightly more inflated in the younger stages. The mode of preserva-

tion does not allow of determining if any gape was present. Outline peculiar; for about
the first half of its life the outline of the shell remained elongate-oval in a vertical direction,
but later the direction of growth changed so that the axis is directed antero-ventrally at
an angle of about 45Â° to the horizontal. That the direction is antero-ventral is confirmed
by the fact that, in the earlier stages, one side is gently convex (the anterior), and the other
is more or less straight and vertical (the posterior), the same condition as is found in many
Recent species. Umbos opisthogyrous. Ventral outline sharply and narrowly rounded, its
culmination, as indicated by the growth lines, being closer to the posterior margin than
to the anterior margin. There is some variation in the degree of elongation of the shell in
the earlier stages, some specimens being wider than the holotype and some narrower.

Divensions. Holotype: length (not quite complete) 98-1 mm. ; height (not quite complete)
157-5 mm.; thickness (both valves) 28-0 mm.

Remarks. The change in direction of growth seems to be characteristic. Vulsella elongata
(von Schauroth) as figured by Oppenheim (19014, p. 148, fig. 13), from the Priabonian
of Lonigo, is narrower and straight. V. granellensis Oppenheim (1gora, p. 150, fig. 14),
