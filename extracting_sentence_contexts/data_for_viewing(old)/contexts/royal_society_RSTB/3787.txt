a reliable indication of the amount of chromatin actually present within it, though
it may well be determined by the accumulation of other substances related to, or
derived from, the chromosomes.

On the other hand, we cannot disregard the effects which external conditions
may sometimes exert on the chromosomes themselves. R. Herrwic, when experi-
menting on the reaction of developing embryos of Strongylocentrotus lividus to
high and low temperatures, discovered the important fact that the chromosomes
of cells which were produced at low temperatures might be two or three times larger
than those formed under warmer conditions. Probably this difference is to be
attributed to the more rapid succession of mitoses at the higher temperature, and
the consequent curtailment of opportunity for growth on the part of the chromosomes.
Mors (1909) also drew attention to the fact that, during spermatogenesis in the

cockroach (Periplaneta Americana), the dimensions of the nuclei and of the
chromosomes are larger in the earlier than they are in the later spermatogonial
divisions.

Conkuin (1912) compared the size of the chromosomes in the macromeres and
micromeres of Crepidula, and states â€œit is plain from the figures that the
chromosomes from the larger nuclei are larger than those from the smaller ones,
though the difference in the diameter and volumes of the chromosomes is not so great
