To be physically meaningful, the ‘frequency’ variable f takes on only positive,
integer values (although to fully invert this transformation and recover the density in the original
random variable, both positive and negative frequencies are needed). In the ECF domain indexed
by frequency f, the representation of the density is much more compact than the density in the
domain of the state variable x. This economy originates in the fact that the Fourier representation
for highly periodic or close to periodic functions is sparse, that is, few of the Fourier coefficients
are large in magnitude [42]. By contrast, the density in the domain of the original, untransformed
variable will typically have no small values at all. Given the typical sparsity of the ECF domain, we can simplify this by only retaining those
coefficients that are larger in magnitude than a given threshold 4; the rest can be set to zero.
