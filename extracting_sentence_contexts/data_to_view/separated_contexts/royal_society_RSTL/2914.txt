Fans. than when the atmosphere is not
more than 662 Faun., as is often the case at the period of swarming, while in reality
a far less volume of air is consumed in August than in May, because the bees are not
in the same state of excitement. These facts readily account for the diminished tem-
perature of the hive in the month of August, when the temperature of the atmosphere
is in general higher than when the bees are most active. During the period of swarming in 1836 I availed myself of the opportunity afforded
me by the annular eclipse of the sun on the afternoon of the 15th of May, of watch-
ing the effect of diminished light and atmospheric temperature on the temperature
of my hives, and the activity of their inhabitants, and found, as shown in the accom-
panying Table, that in proportion to the diminution of light the hives became quiet,
and the temperature of the hives decreased until after the eclipse had passed its
maximum, when as the light began again to increase, the activity of the hives became
restored, and with it a considerable increase of heat. MR. NEWPORT
