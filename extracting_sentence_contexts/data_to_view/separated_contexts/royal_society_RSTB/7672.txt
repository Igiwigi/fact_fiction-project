The latter was in the paper presented by Oleg Ptitsyn, a true visionary in the field of protein
structure, whose death since the last meeting we also note with great sadness. These omissions to some
extent reflect the fact that issues such as these had not yet been described in the molecular detail we
required for the topics we selected for the 1994 meeting. But undoubtedly they also reflect the fact that
protein folding has changed in the last few years from a subject of rather esoteric interest to one that is
now recognized as being coupled to many of the central processes in cellular biology. And because it is so
strongly linked to fundamental cellular activities, any aberrations in the folding process will lead to
malfunctioning of the organism involved, and hence to disease. The present volume contains ten articles on the topic of ‘Protein misfolding and disease’ that relate to
presentations at the Discussion Meeting that took place at The Royal Society in February 2000.
