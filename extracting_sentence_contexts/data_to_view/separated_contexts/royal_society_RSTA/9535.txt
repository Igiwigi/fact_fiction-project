The water equivalent of each bulb was calculated from its mass by means of a formula
for the variation of the specific heat of quartz, which is appropriate if there is no
heat-loss in transference. It appears probable, however, that bulbs of different form
and thickness would experience different losses in transference. In fact, a small
systematic error of this kind is indicated by the observations themselves, and might
produce appreciable errors at the higher temperatures. HEAT OF WATER, WITH EXPERIMENTS BY A NEW METHOD. 13

Below 100째 CG. the uncertainty would probably not exceed 1 in 1,000, as the
thermal capacity of the bulbs employed was only a quarter of that of the contained
water. From 130째 C. to 220째 C. all the observations, except one at 130째 C., were
made with bulbs having a thermal capacity nearly equal to that of the contained
water.
