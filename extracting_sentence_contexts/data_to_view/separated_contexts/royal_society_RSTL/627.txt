92 Dr. RusstLL and My. Home's Observations on the

lateral orifices in serpents, and the bags to which they lead, have
no communication with the organ of hearing. Another fact
ascertained' by him is, that serpents distinguished by lateral
orifices, have a cavity situated between the bag and the eye,
which, 80 far as I know, has not been observed before. Mr. Home's Description, and Remarks. The orifices situated between the eye and the nostril, in the
rattle-snake, and in some species of coluber, do not lead to the
nostril or to the ear, but to a distinct bag, of a rounded form
there is a hollow of the same shape surrounded by bone, and
adapted to' receive it.
