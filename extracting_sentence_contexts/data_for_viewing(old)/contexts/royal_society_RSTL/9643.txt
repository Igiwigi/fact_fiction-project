half an hour. I never but once saw a similar motion in the perfect animal, and this
was in the case of a specimen which was dying from having been poisoned with iron
rus, The motion, I think, can be explained by supposing that the various parts of
the muscle-layer are contracting without co-ordination; but why they should sometimes
do this in response to stimulation, and why when they do this they should continue
the action 80 long, these questions T cannot answer. In the case of s0 peculiar a

phenomenon, however, it is necessary that I should detail all the facts I have been
able to collect, I have never seen any similar or corresponding action performed by
the bells of other medusids, and even in the case of SarsiÂ« its occurrence is com-
paratively rare. When it does occur, however, ib is always continuous ; that is to say,
it never spontaneously recommences after having once ceased. As already stated, the
period of its duration is extremely variable ; but when this period is long, ib is obgery-
able that the shivering motions become feebler and feebler, until they eventually fade
away into quiescence. The animal is then quite dead to all further stimulation.
Beyond saying that the peculiar motions in question never originate independently of
stimulation, I cannot give much further account of the conditions which determine
their commencement. The following instances are quoted from my notes in extenso :
* A healthy individual with centres removed, after failing to respond to either make or
break of direct current, and after about a quarter of a minute's resb from a series of
