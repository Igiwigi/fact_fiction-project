monkeypox is not a new disease, and has probably been spil-

second point annuls the first. The absence of smallpox (and
measles and many other infections) from the Americas and
Australia is clearly an example of dispersal limitation. These
viruses emerged in humans in the Old World, from animal
hosts present only in the Old World [42]. The devastating epi-
demics that occurred when they were finally introduced to
naive populations on other continents are ample testament to
the hazards arising from large pools of susceptible humans.
In contrast, the long history of frequent animal-to-human spil-
