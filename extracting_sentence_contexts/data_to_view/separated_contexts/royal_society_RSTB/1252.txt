the arrested sporangia at the base of the strobilus are to be explained in th
way, though they bridge over the limit between the sporophyll and the true f
leaf. The correlation of growth is often very marked, e.g., in L. phlegmaria,
the foliage leaves are relatively large, while the sporophylls are small: s
might be regarded as those most advanced in point of differentiation,
I see no other way of explaining the presence of these abortive sporangia

which will not readily commend itself. And thus the general conclusion

may now picture to ourselves how, from a simple form, such as Phalloglossu
larger Lycopods may have arisen by elongation and branching of the strobil
