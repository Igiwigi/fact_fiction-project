Comparison of Rachitomi and Stereospondyls.—As the members of the first group
with Capitosaurine skulls show no special adaptations, direct comparison of them,
inter se, will give those characteristic changes which I call advances as clearly as
possible without the admixture of specialisations.

Fig. 29 represents on the same absolute width a series of Capitosaurus-shaped
skulls arranged in order of age. The very remarkable increase in size of the great
palatal vacuities lying between the pterygoids and parasphenoid is well shown by
this figure. Connected with it is the fact that whilst in Eryops the pterygoids
reach to the prevomers, owing to the expansion of the vacuity, they only just
succeed in touching the palatines in Capitosaurus, and in Metoposaurus, which is of
the same age as Cyclotosaurus in which genus the facts are not known, they do not
even reach these elements, but articulate solely with the transverse bones.

Another change well brought out by this series is that there is a steady reduction
in the length of the quadrate ramus of the pterygoid, so that the lower jaw
articulation, which at first lies far behind the connéction of the skull with the neck,
finally comes to lie in front of that plane.

These changes are common to all types of large Amphibia, although they proceed
at very different rates in the different stocks. For example, Micropholis, the latest
known Rachitomous Amphibian, has far larger palatal vacuities than any other
member of that order.
