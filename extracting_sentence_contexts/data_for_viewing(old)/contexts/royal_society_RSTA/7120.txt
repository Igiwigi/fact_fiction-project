peak value was 65 p.p.m. (parts per million) at t.d.c., dropping to 35 p.p.m. just before the
flame. Assuming the additive to be undecomposed, 0-5°% in the fuel represents 84 p.p.m.
in the sampled gas. The high recovery of peroxide in the sampled gas gives good confirma-
tion of the validity of the sampling and analytical methods despite the known stability of
this peroxide which, however, is probably only a little higher than that of some of the
peroxides which might be expected from pre-reactions in highly branched octanes.

The effect of mixture strength on peroxide production was examined (a) at a constant
compression ratio well below the knock limit, and (6) with the compression ratio raised in
each case to a figure giving heavy knock. Under non-knocking conditions the peak peroxide
concentration was found to occur at a mixture strength between 5 and 10% richer than
chemically correct, i.e. approximately at the maximum knock mixture strength (figure 15).
In fact, the curve of peroxide concentration against mixture strength was a close reflexion
of the curve of h.u.c.r. against mixture strength. When the compression ratio was raised to
the knock limit at each mixture strength on the other hand, it was found that the peak
peroxide concentration was sensibly constant over the mixture range (the curve shown is
the average of a large number of determinations). The slight drop in concentration with
increasing mixture strength may be due to after-effects on the peroxides while they are in
transit from the valve to the trap; such effects might be caused by the increased proportion
of fuel residues at richer mixtures.

The curve of peroxide concentration over the mixture range obtained at 1° 1. (figure 16)
shows a pronounced drop at rich mixtures which is unlikely to be explained by the same
effects as might account for the much smaller drop at 7° 1.
