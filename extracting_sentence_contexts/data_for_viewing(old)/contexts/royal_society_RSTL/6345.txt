of three primary kinds of light, red, yellow, and blue, each of which is variable in inten-
sity, but uniform in colour, from one end of the spectrum to the other ; s0 that every
colour in the spectrum is really compound, and might be shown to be 80 if we had the
means of separating its elements.

Sir David BrewsTER, in his researches, employed coloured media, which, according to
him, absorb the three elements of a single prismatic colour in different degrees, and
change their proportions, 80 as to alter the colour of the light, without altering its
refrangibility.

In this paper I shall not enter into the very important questions affecting the phy-
sical theory of light, which can only be settled by a careful inquiry into the phenomena
of absorption. The physiological facts, that we have a threefold sensation of colour,
and that the three elements of this sensation are affected in different proportions by light
of different refrangibilities, are equally true, whether we adopt the physical theory that
there are three kinds of light corresponding to these three colour-sensations, or whether
we regard light of definite refrangibility as an undulation of known length, and there-
fore variable only in intensity, but capable of producing different chemical actions on

different substances, of being absorbed in different degrees by different media, and of
exciting in different degrees the three different colow-sensations of the human eye.
