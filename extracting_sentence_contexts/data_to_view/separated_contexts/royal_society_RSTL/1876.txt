GroTTavUss, for instance, describes the poles as centres of attractive and
repulsive forces (481), these forces yarying inversely as the squares of the di-
stances, and says, therefore, that a particle placed anywhere between the poles
will be acted upon by a constant force. But the compound force, resulting
from such a combination as he supposes, would be anything but a constant
force; it would evidently be a force greatest at the poles, and diminishing to
the middle distance. GroTTavss is right, however, in the fact, according to
my experiments (502. 505.), that the particles are acted upon by equal force
everywhere in the circuit, when the conditions of the experiment are the sim-
plest possible ; but the fact is against his theory, and is also, I think, against
all theories that place the decomposing effect in the attractive power of the
poles. 500.
