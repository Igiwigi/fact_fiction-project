However, in some complex reactions, such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and methane
dry reforming, several tens or even hundreds of energies are involved. Considering the current
computation capacity, some approximations may be needed to simplify this optimization. Regarding the elements in the energy vector, e, they are in fact not independent of each
other. Firstly, the energies of transition states are correlated with the enthalpy changes of
the corresponding steps, known as the BEP relation [21], which can be introduced into the
optimization to approximately halve the size of the energy vector. Secondly, Nerskov and co-
workers [22] proposed a linear scaling, which states that the adsorption energies of many species
