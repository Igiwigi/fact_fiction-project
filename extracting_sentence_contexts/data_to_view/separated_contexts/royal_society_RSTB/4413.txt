We always took care to keep the valves as vertical as possible with the inspiratory
valve lowermostâ€”an important point, as the mica dises of the Siebe Gorman valves
are closed only by gravity and are not assisted by a spring. Dova.as felt quite comfortable when sitting still on the bicycle, but Hopson

always found the position rather irksome. This may account for the high respiratory
exchange shown by Hoxson when at rest, for this was more than one would have
expected even when one allowed for the fact that Hopson was bigger and of greater
muscular development than Dovenas. Hopson was in far better muscular condition
than Doue.as, who was quite out of training. All our experiments were commenced about: two hours after taking a light
breakfast.
