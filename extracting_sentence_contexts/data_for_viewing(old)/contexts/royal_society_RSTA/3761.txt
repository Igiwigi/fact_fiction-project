field and the full analytical solution for sound propagation over flat rigid ground (validation case C). (Online version in colour.)

similar remarks as for validation case A could be made regarding the angle limitation in PE
close to the source, and regarding the magnitude of the destructive interferences. Other (small)
differences might come from the fact that the FDTD is a full-wave technique, including backward
scattering which is fully neglected in the forward-stepping GFPE approach, from the stair-step
approach in FDTD, and from the fact that there will be small phase errors that are inherent to
the FDTD technique [34]. Validation cases A and B further show the accuracy of the equivalence
between a point source and coherent line source solutions in such complex geometries when
expressing results relative to free-field sound propagation (see §2a).

Validation case C (figures 6 and 7) shows excellent agreement between the analytical solution
applied to a dense receiver grid and the analytical starter propagated further with GFPE. The
analytical starter is located at 50m from the source. Only predictions from that distance on are
depicted. The field plots presented in figure 6 are almost indistinguishable. The level differences
