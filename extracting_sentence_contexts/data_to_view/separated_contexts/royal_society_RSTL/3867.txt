Hence it appears, that if the number of summits of a q-acron
be odd, while the faces are all even-angled, the closed g-gon cannot be drawn through
its s1mmits. I find exceedingly few polyedra on which the closed p-gon and q-gon
cannot be drawn. In fact, it is far from being necessary to their existence, that all
the conditions of the theorems A and B $hould be fulfilled. If we cut in two the cell of the bee by a section of its 8ix parallel edges, we have a
13-acron, whose faces are one hexagon and nine quadrilaterals. The closed 13-gon
cannot be drawn.
