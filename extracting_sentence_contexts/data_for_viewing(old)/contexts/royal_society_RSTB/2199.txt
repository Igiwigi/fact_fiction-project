298 PROFESSORS CASH AND DUNSTAN ON THE PHARMACOLOGY OF

The Muscle Curve.

Wretanp* stated that aconitine produced marked prolongation of the muscle
curve, relaxation of the muscle being much retarded; such an effect, in fact, as is
associated with veratrine.

BucHem and EiseNMENGERt also spoke of a considerable variation from the
normal condition.

These observations have not been supported by Murray,{ nor by Boum with
WarrtMann,§ who believe the curve to be unaffected by aconitine. It has been
found that, whilst the curves produced by single and repeated stimulations of pro-
tected and poisoned companion muscles are usually, to all intents and purposes,
identical, occasionally there is a deviation from the normal, attributable to aconitine.
