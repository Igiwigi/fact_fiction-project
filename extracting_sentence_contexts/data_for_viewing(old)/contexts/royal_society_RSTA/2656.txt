The ULCV Emma Maersk was built in 2006 as the first of eight identical container ships owned
by the A.P. Meller-Maersk Group. She has a dead weight tonnage of 156907 tons and can carry
up to 15000 twenty-foot equivalent units. She was holding the record for the world’s largest
ship and still holds the record for the world’s largest and most powerful reciprocating engine: a
slow-speed 2-stroke engine, the Waertsilae RT-flex96c [50,51]. On a slow-steaming load of 65%,
the engine needs 520.2 kg fuel per nautical mile at a sailing speed of 16.38 knots [52]. The total
emission values as well as the calculated possible savings in the three scenarios for this ship class
are given in electronic supplementary material, table S1. Our calculations showed possible fuel
savings of 16.91 kg to 67.63 kg and cost savings of 9.64 US$ to 38.55 US$ per nautical mile in the
three scenarios for the ULCV Emma Maersk.

For the Emma Maersk, we calculated the values for a fictional journey AE10—Eastbound
(Gdansk, Poland to Ningbo, China) of around 11 900 nautical miles (one way) [53]. The calculated
possible fuel savings for this journey are between 201 187.4kg and 804749.4kg, meaning CO2-
emission savings between 629716.4 and 2,518,865.6kg and cost savings of 114676.8 US$ to
458 707.2 US$. The detailed results for the three scenarios are given in electronic supplementary
material, table $2.

(e) Cruise ship Queen Mary II

Queen Mary II with 151400 gross tonnage and a length of 345m is one of the largest operating
cruise ships in the world. She entered service in 2004 and is powered by four Waertsilae 16V46
diesel engines running on heavy fuel oil and two General Electric LM2500+ gas turbines which
run on marine gas oil. On full load, each engine and each turbine burns roughly 3 tons of heavy
