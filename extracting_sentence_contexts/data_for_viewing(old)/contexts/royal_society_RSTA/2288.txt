One might ask how the electroweak monopole can be produced at LHC. In particle physics
the popular monopole production mechanism is the Drell-Yan process and the photon fusion
process [100,101]

pp—>y—> MM ; (1211)

and PP pp + vy > pp + MM,
which is expressed by Feynman diagrams shown in figure 12. This would be the case if we treat
the monopole as a point particle.

This process can be characterized by two points. First, the photon plays a crucial role in : =
the monopole production. Second, the production cross section is uniquely determined by the : =
fundamental constant @, so that in principle, we can calculate the production cross section. In fact, 3
the Feynman diagram tells us that the interaction strength is of the order of one, which strongly : =
implies that the monopole production rate could be very high. 28

However, this monopole production mechanism is totally different from the cosmic monopole if
production mechanism, the thermal fluctuation of the Higgs vacuum. So it is important to : s
compare the two mechanisms more closely and find which mechanism is the correct monopole : S
production mechanism at LHC. : s

On the surface, there seems nothing wrong with the Drell-Yan process, because in particle 18

physics all elementary interactions are supposed to be described by Feynman diagrams. But since
the monopole is a topological particle, it is not clear if this picture is correct. In fact, this picture
