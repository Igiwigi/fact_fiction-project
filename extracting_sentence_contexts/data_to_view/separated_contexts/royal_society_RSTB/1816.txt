An average
number of spore-mother-cells exposed in a single vertical section of a sporangium,
radially through the sorus, is found to be 245; transverse or tangential sections
show that the whole sporogenous mass is about eight layers in thickness; the total
number of spore-mother-cells would therefore be about 1960, and the potential
number of spores per sporangium ahout 1960 x 4 = 7840. As regards the septa dividing the loculi, variations in thickness, and even partial
septations have been seen. The usual thickness of the septum is of three layers of
firm permanent tissue, with a layer of tapetum on either side—from this as normal
{though its thickness may be exceeded), various simpler structures have been seen,
down to a partial septum; in fact, though I have not thought it necessary to
represent the facts by detailed drawings after this has been done so exhaustively for
Danea, the main features are similar to those in that genus. Summary of Results from Study of Kaulfussia. (1.)
