Z That it is the result of water-worked disintegration of the basalts and dolerites,
"She analysis renders more than probable. But whether it does not in fact mark an
Spoch of pause in the volcanic activity of the island, or at least in the N.E. end of

hen submerged area, would need a more minute and extensive topographical study
Sf the district than has yet been given to it. There are veins of a white waxy
ARUuminium silicate traversing the brown or yellowish brown clays, which probably
fill fissures produced by the drying of the original mass, which in some cases, as in
that of certain specimens of the red baked upper layer, seems to have as8umed a
quasi-columnar structure.
