The one or two filaments at the apex of the plica are larger than usual in Cham-
ostrea albida (Hancock, 29), Pandora inequicalva and Anatina flexuosa (not in
Anatina truncata). As already noted by Petsenrer (71, p. 212), the apical
filaments of Lyonsia norvegica are slightly differentiated. The frontal surfaces of
such enlarged filaments are more convex than usual, semi-cylindrical in fact. An
intrafilamentar septum is not uncommonly seen in the ordinary filaments of Lyonsia
nitida. In the upper demibranch the plicee are smaller, and contain some three-fourths of
the number of filaments composing the plicee of the lower demibranch.
