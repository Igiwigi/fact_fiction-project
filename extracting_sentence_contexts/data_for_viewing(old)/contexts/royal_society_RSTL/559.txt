Now it is manifest, that the two pieces AB, BD, though
they touch one another optically, are not in physical contact,
or in the same state in which they were before the fissure was
formed. If we were to make several other notches in the
glass with a file, it would always break at the place of the
fissure ; which proves that the force of cohesion has there been
weakened, and that the surfaces, though optically in contact,
are physically at a distance. The crystallization of the solid
AD, as if it were continuous, forms a fine analogy with the
curious fact in magnetism, that two bars of steel pressed
together at their extremities, may be magnetised as if they
had formed only a single bar, and will exhibit a neutral point
at the place of junction.

PRoPosITION XIX,

When heat is propagated from the centre of a plate of glass in
radial lines, all the fringes and the black spaces form concen-
tric circles, and four black radial spaces, at right angles to each
other, diverge from the centre in directions parallel and perpen-
dicular to the plane of primitive polarisation.
