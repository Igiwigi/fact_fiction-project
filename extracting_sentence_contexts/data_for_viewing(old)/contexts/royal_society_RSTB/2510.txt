Every ophthalmologist who examines the illustrations of the Fundus oculi of the
Mammalia appended to this paper, will surely be struck by the fact that some of the
normal conditions observable in certain animals closely resemble those which we find
in Man as congenital defects. If it be remembered that congenital ocular defects

occur most frequently in those persons who exhibit other signs of abnormal develop-
ment, such as webbed feet or hands, the absence or increase of digits, the non-closure
of various foetal clefts, supernumerary nipples, and the like, the fact above stated
will be admitted as some justification for considering congenital defects as reversions
of type.

Of course, not every congenital defect of the eye is a reversion, if thereby be under-
stood development arrested at a stage which is truly ancestral to the animal which
exhibits the defect in question. In the cases we have to deal with, “ ancestral” is to
mean descent within reasonable limits. A cleft palate in Man is of course a case of
arrested development, but it is no more ancestral than the occurrence of webbed feet,
for the simple reason that there is no normal Mammal in which the palatal bones do
not meet in the median line. It would be rash to confound that which is normal in a
Lizard with what in a Mammal is obviously a malformation.
