always more or less peripheral in position during yolk formation, is never quite so; it
never competes with the “ peripheral spherules” of the yolk already referred to and
yet to be described for a position in actual contact with the vitelline membrane.

Thus the absence of any participation by the yolk nucleus of Antedon in the cell-
metabolism is indicated both by the origin of this structure as a region of the
cytoplasm on to which has diffused a portion only of the material intermittently
discharged from the nucleolus throughout the growth of the oocyte, and by the
fact that its subsequent behaviour can be entirely explained as due to the influence
on a semi-fluid mass of the varying physical conditions obtaining in the cell.

The entirely fortuitous manner in which the yolk nucleus arises in Antedon offers
a ready explanation of a hitherto puzzling fact, that though this structure is of
constant occurrence in those forms in which it occurs at all, it is nevertheless
frequently entirely absent in closely allied species. For it is obvious that very slight
changes in the constitution of the yolk, or in the mode of its formation, might suffice
to remove the conditions under which the diffusion described above could alone take
place.

X. Some Previous Observations on the Yolk Nucleus.

It is not my purpose in the present paper to attempt a comprehensive review of
the yolk nucleus.*
