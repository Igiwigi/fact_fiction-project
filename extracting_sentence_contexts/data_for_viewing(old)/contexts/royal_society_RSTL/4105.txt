A eyer the sides of the tube are composed of flexible membranes, the inclosed air has

a vibratory motion, conjointly with, and snbordinate to that of the parietes of the

tube, whereby the pitch of the sound is affected, as well as its quality. M. Savarr

found that by taking tubes composed of layers of paper of constant length, but vary-

ing in thickness, graver sounds were produced as the parietes became thinner, and

that the gravity of the sound was increased by moistening and relaxing the sides of

the tubes. We hall presently see the application of these facts to the vocal apparatus.

We find the flexibility of the trachea and bronchi capable of being varied by the
