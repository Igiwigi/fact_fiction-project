In my paper of June last, published in the Philosophical Transactions*, I showed,
by observations on the Rigor Mortis, that contraction, in voluntary muscle, essen-
tially consists of an approximation and change of form of the minute particles com-
posing its structure ; the phenomena of contraction in living Monoculi and Arguli
were also briefly adverted to, but it remained undecided in what manner these
minute movements are employed in the higher animals, in the production of motion
during life. The almost insurmountable difficulty of submitting the living muscle of
the Vertebrata to high powers of the microscope, 80 much enhances the value of any
facts bearing on this obscure point, that I am induced to lay before the Society a
8hort account of some recent examinations of human tetanic muscle, which, with the
considerations accompanying them, appear to me to afford conclusive evidence on
the subject.

'Two opportunities have lately occurred to me of carefully observing the conditions
of the muscular system, in cases of fatal tetanus, and the following has been the result :

1. Many muscles appear healthy in all respects.

2. Parts of certain muscles present a remarkably pale gray aspect, arising, doubt-
less, from their blood having been pressed out by the contraction, a state of which the
appearance has been aptly compared by my friend Professor Bupp, to that of the
