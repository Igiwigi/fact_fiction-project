Cutler, Crump & Sandon (1922), in the daily count of the bacterial and protozoan
population of Barnfield farmyard manured soil, extending over a period of one year,
found Naegleria gruberi to be a dominant species of amoeba. It is interesting to note that
N. gruberi, as a dominant soil form, has now been completely replaced by other species.
The writer has not been able to isolate N. gruberi from Rothamsted soils during a period
of over 10 years.

As Hartmannella rhysodes produced wrinkled cysts with pores similar to Naegleria gruberi,
it was thought to be the latter form several years ago. The amoeba used in edibility tests,
recovery of counted suspensions, etc., in connexion with the work on a method ofestimating
the numbers of soil Protozoa (Singh 1946), and called N. gruberi, was, in fact, Hartmannella
rhysodes.

Four strains of H. rhysodes (strains 1, 9, 14 and 15) which from the character of their
cysts appeared different at first sight, were isolated in ‘pure-line’ cultures, starting from
single cysts. The cysts, however, are so very variable within each strain that their appear-
ance cannot safely be used as a diagnostic character. In figure 201 are given several cysts
which appear different. As no differences in the nuclear division of these four strains have
