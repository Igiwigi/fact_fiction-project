In the longer term,
there is reason for optimism. The Internet and Open Access are bringing chemistry to a much
wider audience and, as in astronomy, one can easily imagine an increasing role for interested
amateurs with sufficient free time to recognize patterns within chemical data which have been
overlooked by overburdened professional researchers. Furthermore, we should not forget that,
within research laboratories, the technicians often have a wider factual knowledge of chemical
reactions than the more highly qualified and specialized researchers. In recent years, the periodic table has become an advertising icon across the world (figure 5). Most chemists probably do not realize how fortunate our discipline is to have such a widely
recognized symbol, something that physics lacks.
