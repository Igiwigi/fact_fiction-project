Remarkable Instances of Acoustic Opacity.

In his excellent lecture entitled © Wirkungen aus der Ferne,” Dovs has collected some striking cases of tho
interception of sound. During the battle of Cassano on the Adda, between the Due de Vend6me and the
Prince Eugene, an army corps stationed under the Duke's brother five miles up the river failed to join the battle
through not hearing tho cannonade. In a riyer-valley, particularly on a warm day, it would, in my opinion,
be perilous to place much dependence upon sound. Near Monterean on the Seine, during the battle between
Napoleon I. and the King of Wurtemberg, which lasted seven hours, no sound of the conflict was heard by
Prince Schwartzenberg 13 miles up the river. A Prussian officer sent thither at noon first heard tho cannonade
at a distance of 4} miles from the field of battle, This happened on a day apparently resembling-in point of
mildness and serenity our 3rd of July. In the battle of Liegnitz, where Frederick the Great overthrew Landon,
the sound of. the battle was unheard by Field-Marshal Daun, who was posted on a height 44 miles from the
battle-field. Dovys himself recounts the fact of his having failed to catch a single shot + the battle Gs Katzback
at 4} miles distance, while he plainly heard the cannonade of Bautzen 80 miles awuy. 5

The stoppage of the sonnd in the foregoing cases Dovs referred, and doubtless correctly, to the non-homo-
geneous character of the air. He also notes the exceedingly interesting obseryation that in certain clear winter
days, when the sun has already attained 8ome power, the semaphore is difficult to decipher, the reason being
that by the s8vlar warmth upward currents of warm and downward currents of cold air (similar to those of
HrawoLvr on the plain of Antures) are established, and that snch days are also unfayourable to the transmission
of 8ound. In another passage, however, he seems to indorse the prevalent notion that the optical transparency
of the air and its power to transmit sound go hand in hand; whereas in our experiments days of the highest
optical transparency proved themselves acoustically most opaque.
