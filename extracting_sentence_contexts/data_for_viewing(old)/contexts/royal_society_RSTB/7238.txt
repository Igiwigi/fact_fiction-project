canal appears for a short distance on the broken hind surface of the specimen; the position
of the external canal has already been noticed on the lateral skull wall, so that the connexions
of these two with the cranial cavity are fixed.

The shape and course of the lateral cranial canal is inevitably not so certain in this genus
as in Caturus, since it was not possible to excavate it far. The position of the posterior opening,
however, and its relations to the 10th nerve and posterior semicircular canal are so similar
in the two genera that there can be little doubt that the structure exists in Dapedius. The
anterior opening presumably lies in the large unexcavated hollow above the external
semicircular canal; it appears to be much larger than the corresponding opening in Caturus,
while the vertical pillar separating the lateral cranial canal from the utriculus is decidedly
narrower. The result is that the canal is much more part of the cranial cavity in this genusâ€”
a fact which rather increases the difficulty of assigning to it any of those functions, suggested

from comparison with living fishes or Palaeoniscoids, which were discussed when dealing
with Caturus.

The position of the anterior semicircular canal can only be deduced from its entrances
to the cranial cavity; it seems to have been rather longer than the posterior canal. The
ampullary chamber is very large, and less clearly separated from the cranial cavity than
that of Caturus, nor is there any impression to show whether the ampulla of the external
canal was particularly enlarged. There are a number of nerve apertures in the floor of the
