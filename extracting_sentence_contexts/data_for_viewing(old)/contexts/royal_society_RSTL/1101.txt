Could not the experiment of M. M. Gay Lussac and! Tahexarp be explained,
except on the $upposition of the hydrogene being derived from the potassium, it would
be a distinct fact in favour of the revival of the theory of phlogiston. It would not
prove, however, that potas;ium is composed of hydrogene and potash, but that it is
compozed of hydrogene and an unknown basis ; and that potash is this basis united
to water,


368 Mr. Davy's Electrochemical Researches on

Other hypotheses might be formed upon the new electro-
chemical facts, in which still fewer elements than those allowed
in the antiphlogistic or phlogistic theory might be maintained.
Certain electrical states always coincide with certain chemical
states of bodies. Thus acids are uniformly negative, alkalies
positive, and inflammable- $i b;tances highly positive ; and as I
have found, acid matters when positively electrified, and alka-
line matters when negatively electrified, seem to loose all their
peculiar properties and powers of combination. In these in-
stances the chemical qualities are shewn to depend upon the
electrical powers; and it is not impossible that matter of the
same kind, possessed of different electrical powers, may
exhibit different chemical forms.*
