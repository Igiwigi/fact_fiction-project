gun attended by tidally-disturbed planets, with no satellites, may easily be determined.
For if we pub c*=#, and note that N varies as a, and that n' has the form (h—kz)/C",
we see that it would only be necessary to evaluate a series of integrals of the form

from zq to z, and the time scale is the same for all the planets. It is not at present
worth while to pursue this hypothetical case further.

Now if we suppose the planet to raise frictional tides in the un, as well as the 8un
to raise tides in the planets, we easily see by a double application of (2) that

The tides raised in the planet by its satellites do not occur explicitly in this equation,
but they do occur implicitly, becanse 1, the planet's rotation, is affected by these tides.

The question which we now have to ask is whether in the equation (28) the solar
term (without accents) or the planetary term (with accents) is the more important.

In the solar system the rotations of the sun and planets are rapid compared with the
orbital motions, so that N may be neglected compared with both n and 1.
