tables, one of the sequences of the bases with the acids, and
another of those of the acids with the different bases ; and if
either or both of the tables are imperfect, their deficiencies
may often be supplied, and their errors corrected, by a re- '
peated comparison with each other.

In forming tables of this kind from the cases collected by
Fourcoy, I have been obliged to reject some facts, which
were evidently contradictory to others, and these I have not
thought it necessary to mention ; a few, which are positively
related, and which are only inconsistent with the principle of
numerical representation, I have mentioned in notes; but many
others, which have been stated as merely prohable, I have
omitted without any notice. In the table of simple elective at-
tractions, I have retained the usual order of the different sub-
stances:; inserting again in parentheses such of them as require
to be transposed, in order to avoid inconsequences in the simple
-attractions: I have attached to each combination marked with
an asterise the number deduced from the double decomposi-
tions, as expressive of its attractive force ; and where the
