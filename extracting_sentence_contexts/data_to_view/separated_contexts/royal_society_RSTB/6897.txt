This conclusion is discussed in relation to several biological problems, including ovarian function,
pregnancy, embryonic growth, and cancer. I. InrropucTIon

It has been known for some time that one important function of the oestrogenic hormones,
that, in fact, by which they are recognized, is to induce extreme mitotic activity in the
female accessory sexual organs of the vertebrates, and it might be supposed that substances
which are capable of inducing active mitosis in one type of tissue would also be capable
ofa similar action in others. As a preliminary test of this supposition it was decided to make
a survey of cell division in the various body organs of the adult female mouse in an attempt
to discover whether such division is normally under the control of these hormones. The
results obtained in the course of the work suggested that a consideration of cell division in
abnormal conditions would also prove interesting, especially by comparison with the
normal.
