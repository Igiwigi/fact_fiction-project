as an invariant of all its (re)presentations in a permanently self-renewing discourse’, [42].

Not only is mathematics as a whole not a text, in any important respect even individual
mathematical proofs are not just texts, and cannot be reduced to such texts. They are of essentially
multi-dimensional character. As a first approximation, you can think of a proof as a map, a chart,
a blueprint. ..From the way it functions, a mathematical proof can be visualized as a fishing net.
Such a net may have holes, even rather big ones, and at some point you might wish to patch or
repair it. But its sole function is to catch fish: “You need a net to catch fish, at the moment the fish is
caught, you forget the net. You need words to catch thought, at the moment the thought is caught
you forget the words.’

However, at the deeper personal level the decisive element of Mathematics, oftentimes more
imperative than its factual, technical, pragmatical or mystical dimensions, is its aesthetic value. The
way we experience mathematical proofs is essentially not much different from the way we behold
quattrocento frescoes: Piero della Francesca, Filippo Lippi, Benozzo Gozzoli, Pinturicchio, or any of
their contemporaries. Or, for shorter proofs, the way we savour la pittura fiamminga, someone like
Robert Campin, Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, or Hans Memling. Their works possess an
enormous level of precision, and precision of Mathematics is of the same, or very similar nature.


Even if a fresco is not finished, altered by subsequent intrusions, damaged by time, poorly
illuminated. ..at a glance you know its value, the artistic school to which the master belonged,
its subject matter, the idea behind the composition, etc. Looking a bit more carefully, you can
appreciate many further details, technical level, materials used, possible implications, etc. And
eventually, you get a very clear idea as to master’s intent and as to whether he could have
