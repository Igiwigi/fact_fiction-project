Except for the
qs006023_t007 model (which has a different lower boundary condition), the subphotospheric
layers are dominated by ‘ridges’ of constant, strongly positive phase values (red features in
figure 12) on a background of only slightly positive phase values (green areas). We cannot offer
an explanation for this striking behaviour yet, merely some speculative ideas: assuming that
the sound waves are created near the upper boundary of the convection zone, one would have
expected a similar behaviour as in the atmosphere, just with the opposite sign, i.e. downward
propagating acoustic waves, showing up as positive phase differences, increasing with frequency
(from green over yellow to red). The fact that we see phase ‘ridges’ suggests an interference
pattern, possibly caused by the reflection of the downward propagating sound waves at the
lower boundary. These ‘ridges’ may therefore be related to the pseudo-modes [33] observed in
the atmosphere (see also figure 11, where the modal structure of the p-modes can be followed
beyond the acoustic cutoff frequency of about 5.5 mHz). These high-frequency pseudo-modes are
caused by the interference of waves coming directly from the source and those being reflected
in the solar interior [33].
