When comparing the SERS spectra of brazilein with the brazilwood lake paint reconstruction
(from recipe 8 of the The book on how to make colours, where gypsum is used as a filler and
gum arabic as a binder [15]) small differences were found mostly in the region between 1700
and 1100cmâ„¢!, possibly resulting from the presence of gypsum (table 3 and figure 4). In fact,
considering the use of HF pre-treatment on the lake pigment brazilwood reconstruction, the
bonds in the metal-dye complex should have been broken [17,50], which means that in both
spectra brazilein is present. There have been previous observations [13,53] that have shown that
the matrix of a paint, whether an inorganic pigment or proteinaceous binder, may interfere with
