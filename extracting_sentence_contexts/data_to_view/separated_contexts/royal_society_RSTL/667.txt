Imeter was rendered luminous, and produced a ſtrong wind like a

point. Anine-inch cylinderwith an eight-inch cuſhion occaſioned
Efrequent flaſhes from the round end of a conduQor 4 inches
Sdiameter : with a ball of 24 inches diameter the flaſhes ceaſed
how and then, and it began to appear luminous : a ball of 1+
Snch diameter firſt gave the uſual flathes ; then, by quicker
Sturning, it became luminous with a bright ſpeck moving about
n its ſurface, while a conſtant ſtream of air ruſhed from it ;
