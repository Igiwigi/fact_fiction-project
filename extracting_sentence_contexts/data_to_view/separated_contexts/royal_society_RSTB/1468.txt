When discussing the effect of temperature on the body length of the larvee, it y
noticed that an increase in the temperature during development from 20Â° to 2
caused about 2 per cent. decrease in size. Where the temperature fell below 18
there was also a decrease in the body length. We arrive, therefore, at the interestin
fact that one and the same change in the environment produces a different effect
each of the parts of the larva subjected to measurement. It causes a decrease
the body length, a considerable increase in the aboral arm length, and a slighte
increase in the oral arm length. This is in some ways a remarkable conclusion, for
follows that all the tissues of the body of a comparatively simple organism
the pluteus are never at one and the same time adapted in the most favou
manner possible to their environmental conditions.
