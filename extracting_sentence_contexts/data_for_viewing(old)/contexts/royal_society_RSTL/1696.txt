136 - Dr. Henscner.'s Observations of a Comet,‚Äù

an hemispherical hollow shell, the luminous matter in its di-
verging progress upwards can only form a hollow cone; and
the appearance of the two bright streams inclosing the tail,
after what has been said of the envelope, will want no farther
explanation.

Add to this that, having actually seen these brilliant streams
remain at the borders of the tail in the same diverging situa-
tion during a motion of the comet through more than 190
degrees, the hollow conical form of the comet's tail is in fact
established by observation.

The feebler light of the tail between its branches is suffi-
ciently accounted for by the thinness of the luminous matter
of the hollow'cone through which we look towards the middle
of the tail compared with its/great depth about the sides; and
indeed the comparative darkness of the inside of the cone and
transparency of the atmosphere seen through the envelope,
bear witness to their hollow construction; for, were these parts
solid, 'both the cone and the hemispherical termination of it
must have been much brighter in the-middle than towards the
circumference, which is contrary-to observation.
