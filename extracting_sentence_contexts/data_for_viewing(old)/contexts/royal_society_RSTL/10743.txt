146 MR. H. TOMLINSON ON THE INFLUENCE OF STRESS

the third and fourth values* of 2, which may perhaps be assumed to represent approxi-

mately the average alteration of resistance for a given moderate magnetizing force, we
find that with this wire the increase per unit of resistance produced by an absolute
electromagnetic unit of magnetizing force would be 2335 X 10-5,

It is desirable to draw attention also to the fact that with both iron and vickel there
is no change of resistance of the nature of a decrease produced by magnetization, but
that starting with a current from one Guove's cell through a total external resistance
of about 15 ohms? and with a magnetizing force nob greater than 26 times the earth's
horizontal magnetic force at the place, we find a continuous increase of reistance as
the magnetizing force is increased.

Tar EFFECT OF ALTERING THE STRENGTH OF THE B.C. ON THE CHANGE OF
RESISTANCE PRODUCED BY ANY MAGNETIZING FORCE.

The results recorded in the last two experiments are 80 far ab variance with
AvzrBacn's views already alluded to, that it seemed advisable to still further test
these views by altering the strength of the B.C. whilst that of the M.C. is maintained
