All observations yet made upon the magnetisation of iron are upon the straight
part of WzBER's curve. 2, The particular features of curves of magnetisation as ordinarily observed arise
from a 8light irregularity in WeBer's curve, magnified by the near approach of iron
to a state in which a random distribution of the magnetic axes of the molecules is
unstable. I do not put these remarks forward as indicating more than the fact that we are
very long way from obtaining a range of facts sufficiently extended for testing Â©
molecular theory of magnetism: The broad fact which strikes the mind mos forcibly
is the specific difference which exists between magnetic and non-magnetie bodies. Most bodies are either very slightly ferro-magnetic or very slightly diamagnetic. On
the other hand iron, nickel, and cobalt are enormously magnetic.
