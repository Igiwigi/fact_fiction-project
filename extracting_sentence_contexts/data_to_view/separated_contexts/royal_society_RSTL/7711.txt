S * We cannot neglect the mean square as compared with the mean 1st power, as the latter is the algebraical

A sometimes vanish altogether ; whereas the former is the sum of a number of positive elements, and therefore

cannot vanish,

+ Tf the new Error be such as to give any discontinuous distribution of points (se art. 4), it is easy to satisfy
ourselyes, by the method of art. 6, that the above proposition «till holds good. In fact, if the n values of the
new Error be «,, @,, #,, - - - -, We 8hall have, instead of the formula (7),

n=ME—a)+/(E—n)+f(E—2)+&6-þ

which is true in all cases, whether the distribution be continuous or discontinuous, or a mixture of both ; and
hence the formula (9) will follow.

+ This snggestion is due to Professor J, C. Anans, one of the Referees charged by the Royal Society with the
duty of reporting upon the present Paper. The remainder of the proof, which was of a different nature in the
Paper as originally presented, is much simplified thereby.
