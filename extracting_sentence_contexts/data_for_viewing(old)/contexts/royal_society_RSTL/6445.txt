Table IX., between the composition of the increase of the animals of different breeds,
Sor those fed on different foods, are really to be attributed to the variations in those con-
Aditions as there described. It is enough to claim, that the results, as a whole, give us
the best indication of the probable composition of the increase of fattening Sheep, at
Present at command.

To go to the figures (see Table IX.), the increase of fattening Sheep appeared to
contain from 2 to 3 per cent. of mineral matter. Either of these estimates is, however,
undoubtedly too high. The error is due to the amount of adventitious mineral matter
in the ash of the wool, as before referred to, which happened to be the greater in
that of the fatter animals. It was still thought better to record the numbers in the
Table as calculation gave them, as it would thus be seen (with the explanation given)
below what amounts the truth must really fall. In fact, excluding altogether from the

would appear to be certainly under 2, and sometimes under 14 per cent., for the
of the fattening Sheep given in the Table. |

The average estimated percentage of ni#rogenous compounds in the increase of :
