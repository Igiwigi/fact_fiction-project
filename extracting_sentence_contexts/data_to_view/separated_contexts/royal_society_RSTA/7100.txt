Hence in the limit x-+—0, equation (99) becomes

: Ps 4 Op; 4 Op; Op Op
| ca +f oat er la pay + fe dy (t<t), (100)

where limits refer to corresponding points in figure 1 with points D and A subject to the
restriction that they lie outside the disturbance due to the strip up to time 4. But the incident wave is itself a plane wave travelling in the negative x direction so that
we have

Op; — Op;

whence equation (100) may be written
* Pe dy Sa 49

It we now denote by v the particle velocity component in the negative x direction, and
by p the mass density, then
yp Ys somali

and inserting this in equation (102) and integrating from —0 to ¢ we obtain

SOUND PULSES BY AN INFINITELY LONG STRIP 87

The relevant points A and D in figure 1 have been restricted only by the condition that they
lie outside the disturbance due to the strip up to time ¢,. In fact, v and ; are identical outside
this region so that the integrands on the right-hand side of equation (104) are zero outside
the region of disturbance due to reflexion and diffraction at the strip. The physical interpretation of equation (104) is that the excess rate of total flow to the
sides due to the presence of the strip is proportional to the total force (or average pressure)
on the rear of the strip. The preceding relations have been derived generally for any time-variation in the
incident pulse.
