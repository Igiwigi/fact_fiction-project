6—PartTicuLAR MEAN VALUES

By a “particular mean value” we denote the average value, over a particular
calendar month or year, of the temperature or meteorological element at particular
times of day at a particular station.

For Port Erin Bay and the lightvessels, the evaluation of the particular monthly
and yearly mean values of sea-water temperature, both at 9 a.m. or sunrise and at
4 p.m., is a direct calculation. The sums were effected to 1° F. and the mean
values deduced to 0-1° C. But for none of the other observations of sea-water
temperatures is this direct operation possible, and, in fact, no other particular monthly
and yearly mean values of such temperatures have been evaluated.

For the meteorological elements, particular monthly mean values have been
taken directly from the Monthly Weather Reports of the Meteorological Office,
from the Annual Reports of the Fernley Observatory at Southport, and from the
records of the Liverpool Observatory.*

Liverpool Observatory and Tidal Institute.
