M.S. WATSON ON THE STRUCTURE,

suture separating these bones passes outside the foramen for the tenth nerve,
which opening hence lies entirely within the exoccipital. That this suture is
certain, is shown by the fact that on the right side of R. 506 the two bones have
separated slightly at the top, allowing of a very distinct tongue of matrix coming
between them, and that the same thing has happened at the lower end on the other
side. There is a small foramen for the twelfth nerve, lying on the side of the exoccipital
just above the condyle. In front the bone is extended by a process running along the
parasphenoid and lying below the lower edge of the inner end of the stapes, so that
in the bony skull the fenestra ovalis is surrounded below by the exoceipital, and
only to a very small extent by the parasphenoid.
