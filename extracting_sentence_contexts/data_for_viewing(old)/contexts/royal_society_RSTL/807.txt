confirmation, from a desire to keep in view the remembrance of
retrospective accounts, and to combine them with intimations
for future research. : The due cultivation of this interesting
pursuit cannot fail to elucidate many of the phenomena in
question, to remove premature and ill founded physiological
opinions, and eventually to aid in rendering the medical art
more beneficial, by establishing its doctrines on more extensive
and accurate views of the animal economy.
