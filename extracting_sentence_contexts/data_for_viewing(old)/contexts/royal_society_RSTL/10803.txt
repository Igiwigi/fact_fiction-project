sufficiently rapidly at first ; (2) it attains a higher maximum than is actually
realized. Let us examine these errors in detail.
(1) The angle the characteristie makes with the axis of avscissm near the origin is

mainly determined by the line B, We have in fact a very considerable extension of

the area. of the field beyond that which lies under the bored face of the pole-piece.
The following consideration will show that the extension may be considerable.
Imagine an infinite plane 8Jab, and parallel with it a second slab cut off by a second

the plates by the spreading of the lines of induction beyond the boundary. We know
that the actual extension of the area will be greater than we shall calculate it to be if
we prescribe an arbitrary distribution of lines of force other than that which is
