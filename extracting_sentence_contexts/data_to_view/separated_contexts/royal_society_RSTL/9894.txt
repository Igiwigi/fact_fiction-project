The lime light, though fulfilling this condition, is not 8uita
because of the high refrangibility of its heat. The incandescent platinum spiral woul,
be better ; still, the radiation from this source is but feebly absorbed by the aqueous
vapour taken up by air at ordinary temperatures. The oxyhydrogen flame fulfils the
required conditions best.* Tt has the advantage of high temperature and low re-
frangibility, while the fact that its heat, as coming from aqueous vapour, is absorbed
with special energy, by aqueous vapour, is also a strong recommendation. Tn the
Bakerian Lecture for 1864, IT have illustrated this point. It was then shown that
when a platinum spiral, rendered incandescent by a voltaic current, had 5*8 per cent,
of its heat absorbed by un-dried air, a hydrogen flame had from 17 to 20 per cent, of
its heat absorbed.
