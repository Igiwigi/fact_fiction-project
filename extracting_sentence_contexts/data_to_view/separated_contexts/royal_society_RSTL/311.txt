This struck me the more, as I recollected
having, two years ago, perceived such an appearance at the
outward edge, near the points of the cusps, though I did not
then reflect on the cause of it. As all the requisite circumstances, however, do not often
coincide, I thought myself particularly fortunate when; on the
24th of February, I was favoured with a lucky combination
of them. Although this be as yet only a single observation
of the sort, it is, however, in every respect s0 complete, and
the inferences it leads to are,"to me at least, 80 new and in-
teresting, that I cannot withhold it from those liberal minded
men, who are zealous in the pursuit of genuine philosophical
knowledge. f


on the Atmosphere of the Moon. 339

On the abovementioned evening, at z* 40', two days and
twelve hours after the new moon, when in consequence of the
libration, the western border of the grey surface of the Mare
Crisium was 1' 20'' distant from the western limb of the moon,
the air being perfectly clear, I prepared my seven-Å¿eet reflector,
magnifying seventy-four times, in order to observe the first
clearing-up of the dark hemisphere, which was illuminated
oaly by the light of our earth, and more especially to ascertain
whether in fact this hemisphere, which, as is well known, is
always somewhat more luminous at the limb than in the
middle, would emerge out of our twilight at many parts at
once, or first only at the two cusps. Both these points ap-
peared now, most distinctly and decidedly, tapering in a very
sharp, faint, scarce any where interrupted, prolongation ; each
of them exhibiting, with the greatest precision, its farthest ex-
tremity faintly illuminated by the solar rays, before any part
of the dark hemisphere could be distinguished. But this dark
hemisphere began s0on after to clear up at once at its border,
though immediately only at the cusps, where, but more parti-
cularly at their points, this border displayed, on both at the
same time, a luminous margin, aboye a minute in breadth, of a
very pale grey light, which, compared with that of the farthest
extremities of the cusps themselves, was of a very different co-
lour, and relatively as faint as the twilight I discovered on the
dark hemisphere of Venus, and that of our own earth, when
compared with the light immediately derived from the sun.
