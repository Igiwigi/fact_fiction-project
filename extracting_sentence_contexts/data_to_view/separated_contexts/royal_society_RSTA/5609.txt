Accordingly, the relative error € increases with the number of healthy people. This
relative error might be huge. In fact, it is particularly big in cases of ‘mild’ epidemics characterized
by s(t) ~ 0. Again, given the finite value of the false positive rate a, mass testing of people who feel
healthy is not really advised, unless appropriate statistical corrections are done. It might lead to a
large overestimation of the actual disease rate.
