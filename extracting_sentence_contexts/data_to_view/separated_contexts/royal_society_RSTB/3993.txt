At the end of our
campaign seven Europeans spent nine days at a height of more than 20,700 feet,
during which time four of them camped for the night at 21,673 and 22,843
feet, and this without even the inconvenience of sleeplessness. They likewise
made two steep ascents, through deep soft snow, to 23,458 and 24,600 feet,
without exhaustion, without lowering of morale, without exaggerated difficulty
of breathing, palpitation, or irregularity of the pulse, and with no symptom of
headache, nausea, or the like. The fact of the immunity admits of but one
interpretationâ€”rarefaction of the air, under ordinary conditions of the high
mountains, to the limits reached by man at the present day (125 inches) does
not produce mountain sickness. Moreover, rarefaction of the air is not incom-
patible with mountaineering work, if this is done very slowly and methodically. From this it follows that the phenomena which have to this day been considered
to be the result of rarefaction are, in reality, phenomena of fatigue, or merely
incapacity (temporary or permanent) of the system to sustain the exertion of
climbing, manifesting itself with special symptoms under the presence of the
particular external conditions which prevail in the mountains.
