For all sequence, SZZPBS and ZZPBS superimpose with an
three structures, over 50% of the sugars adopt the C2’-endo r.m.s.d. of 1.66 A, whereas SSPBZ, which differs in sequence
conformation most commonly observed in B-form DNA from SZZPBS, superimposes with an r.m.s.d. of 0.6A
(figure 2d). For comparison, 74% of sugars in A-form DNA (figure 3). In fact, these two structures are the most similar

base pairs indicates that, although the distances fall within underlying features that contribute to these structural differ-
the range seen in natural B-DNA (9.8-12 A), the average dis- ences, we examined nucleobase pair hydrogen-bonding, local
tance of 10.8 A is slightly longer in ALIEN base pairs than in base pair parameters and local base pair step parameters for
natural base pairs, with an average of 10.5 A; each ALIEN all possible nucleobase pairs.
