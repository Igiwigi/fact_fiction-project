Prom the earlicst phase of a star's life the dissipation of energy would, as it were, bring
2 into play a new supply of heat, and 8 prolong the star's light. May it not also be that if chemists take up this question which has arisen from the
E gpectroscopic evidence of what I haye before termed the plasticity of the molecules of
Â© - the metalloids taken as a whole, much of the power of variation which is at present
EZ accorded to metals may be traced home to the metalloids? I need only refer to the
EZ fact that, 80 far as T can learn, all 80-called changes of atomicity take place when metal-
S loids are involyed, and not when metals alone are in question. | As instances of these, T may refer to the triatomic combinations formed with chlorine,
2 oxygen, suIphur, &e. in the case of tetrad or hexad metals. 5
