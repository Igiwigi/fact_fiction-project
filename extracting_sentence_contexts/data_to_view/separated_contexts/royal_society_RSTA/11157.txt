Trans.,’ loc. cit.). In the paper just
referred to the number 8°6 X 10-* was given as an approximate value of the radius
in centims. of water-drops equivalent in their action to these nuclei. The nuclei are
therefore not much larger than molecules; the fact that dense condensation takes
place with a supersaturation only twice as great when, as far as can be judged, no
nuclei are present other than the molecules of vapour and gas, is further evidence
that the nuclei with which we are here concerned are not very large compared with
