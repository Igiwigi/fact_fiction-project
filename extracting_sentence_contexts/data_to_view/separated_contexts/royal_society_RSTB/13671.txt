; To explore population differences in mean polygenic
populations scores, we can use the polygenic score equivalent of Qsr/

variance in additive genetic values attributable to among-
population differences. Under neutrality, for strictly additive
traits we expect Qs; to equal 2Fsy estimated from neutral

number of populations (an extension of the Lewontin—Kra-
