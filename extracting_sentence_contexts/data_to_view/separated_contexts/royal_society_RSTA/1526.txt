In SLO images, the macular region appears dark because of the strong absorption by the Lo |
macular pigment (excitation wavelength 488nm). By contrast, in SIO imaging, detection of

autofluorescence of the macular RPE is possible (excitation wavelength 532 nm). 3
The SIO prototype, unlike SLO, did not produce high-resolution dynamic live images. This is 1S

particularly due to the fact that the individual images to be used had to be selected from the 60
acquired images and shifted accordingly. However, an appropriate automation should be possible
by adapting appropriately fast SIM techniques presently used in microscopy application. In this
study, we limited ourselves to a feasibility study of the SIO technique.
