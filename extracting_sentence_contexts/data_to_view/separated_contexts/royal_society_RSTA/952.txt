This could suggest that the fracture of three-dimensional solids may
not be simply reduced to a two-dimensional depinning problem. However, the scaling exponents.
reported in [59] evolve with the driving velocity, in strong contrast to our measurements, leading
to robust scaling exponent values, for different loading conditions, with very different average
crack front velocities. Therefore, this discrepancy might simply arise from the fact that the
quasi-static assumption of the depinning model is not satisfied in those experiments. To further characterize the statistics of these avalanches, we also examine their maximum
amplitudes measured by Vmax, where we have renormalized the crackling noise signal by the
average crack front velocity value, ie. Vi(t)/(v), to compare experiments performed at very
different average velocities.
