Similarly with the phyllosiphonic arrangement of the vascular tissue, it is open to
any one to hold that this is nothing more than the internal structural expression of
the accomplished fact of a larger leaf-development, and confirmed as a constant in
those plants where large leaf-development is the type. A race originating from a
small-leaved stock, and becoming large-leaved, would in the process undergo conversion
from the one anatomical type to the other. Something of this nature is actually the
case in the young Leptosporangiate Fern, where the stem is protostelic at first, and
only becomes phylosiphonic at a later stage.*

If such changes did take place during descent, the distinction of Dr, Jerrrey
would not rank as defining phylogenetically distinct races, but rather as a register of
such leaf development in the mature plants as differentiated them from some common
source. This is the view of the facts which I adopt, and consequently the Pteropsida
and Lycopsida are, in my view, not to be regarded as without any phylogenetic
relation, but two phases of development of a strobiloid type, separated at a very early
period on the ground of external form, and consequent anatomical difference.

But the question remains whether this megaphyllous development happened only
once, or more than once among the Pteridophyta; in other words, whether all
Dr. Jerrreyâ€™s Pteropsida are really akin, so far as to represent one primitive stock.
