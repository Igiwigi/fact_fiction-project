There are other examples of analysis of mitigation effectiveness at an urban scale recently
reviewed by the UK Air Quality Expert group. From that analysis of a wide range of AQ case
studies [39], they identified the following needs:

— Extensive measurements; as the increased amount of data will generally improve the
overall statistical power of the analysis.

— Monitoring of activity data as this provides important bounds.

— Predicting outcomes, as it is necessary to make predictions of the interventions (or the
counter-factual) for the purposes of contextualizing results and hypothesis testing.

— Taking account of meteorology; as meteorology is a major controlling factor
in AQ.
