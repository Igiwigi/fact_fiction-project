In the later stages of degeneration, when the fatty products
of the decomposition of the fibres have been absorbed, this black staining is naturally
no longer observable. It is important also to observe that ordinary neutral fats, such
as are contained in adipose tissue, give the Marchi reaction. It was knowledge of
this fact that led us in part to the present investigation, and our expectation has
been fully confirmed that the cause of the Marchi reaction in degenerated nerve fibres
is the replacement. of the phosphorised fat by non-phosphorised fat. Before the commencement of our joint work, one of us (F'. W.
