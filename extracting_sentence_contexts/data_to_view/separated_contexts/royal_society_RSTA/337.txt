temperature associated with the rising convection current. The fact that no such activity is
found in the Outer Hebrides may indicate that the original current did not extend as far
west as the present field of positive anomalies. To try to account for the anomalies by
assuming the rocks in this region are abnormally dense is not satisfactory. Even if we take
the density to be 3-0, a thickness of at least 10,000 ft. would be required.
