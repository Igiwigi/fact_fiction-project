Spatangus, and the internal surface of that piece painted with acid, its spines and
pedicellarize, although severed from any possible nervous connexion 8ave those of
the external plexus, will continue to perform their function of localising a seat of
stimulation.

As regards, then, the more general function of the spines, we have firs to consider
what we may term their general reflex irritability—1.e., their power of active bristling
response all over the animal when any part of its surface is strongly stimulated, as by
burning. Immediately after the operation of removing the nerve-centre this function
is found to be in abeyance, or nearly 80—strong stimulation of one part of the animal
not being followed by any response of the spines in other parts. This effect, however,
completely passes off within several hours after the operation, and is therefore to be
attributed to shock. The fact, however, that the influence of shock is thus revealed
in temporarily suspending this general nervous communication among the spines,
proves that this general communication, unlike the more special one which they share
with the pedicellariz, is itself in communication with the central nervous ring. Fur-
ther, the experiments detailed in a previous part of this paper prove that the medium
of communication is in this case the hypothetical internal nervous plexus, as in the
case just mentioned the medium of communication has been proved to be the external
nervous plexus. And as the effect of the operation in question is only transitory
—aſter recovery from shock the spines being as responsive as ever to severe stimu-
lation—we must conclude that the general communication between the spines is
maintained by the direct conductility of the supposed internal plexus, and is not of
the nature of a reflex in which the nerve-ring is concerned as a general centre. The
only effect of removing this nerve-ring is temporarily to paralyse, through shock, the
