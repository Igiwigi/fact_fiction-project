Thus, it
seems obvious to investigate the use of slow light to enhance the spin-photon coupling at
C-points in photonic crystal waveguides. However, standing waves (modes with vg =0) are
constrained by temporal symmetry and the reciprocal nature of light: that is, the equal forwards
and backwards travelling components of the wave destroy propagation direction symmetry
breaking, ensuring that any chirality must vanish. This fact places limits on the use of chirality in
the slow-light regime. In this paper, we use calculations of the waveguide eigenmodes to investigate the limit of
polarization chirality in photonic crystal waveguides in the slow-light regime. We analyse the
temporal symmetry constraint in greater depth, showing that the chirality disappears when
C-points of opposite handedness approach and annihilate each other as vg â€” 0.
