are here dealing with a radicle group of elements, NH,, and not with three simple
interchangeable elements of the same family group of Menperrerr’s table,
definitely progressive in atomic weight and in all the properties which accompany
atomic weight. Yet the group NH, possesses the singular power of chemically
replacing these alkali metals in their salts, as also does the metal thallium, which
is well known to be of a different nature to the three alkali metals potassium,
rubidium, and cesium. It has now been shown that the replacement occurs in these

two non-eutropie cases with surprisingly slight alteration of the morphology of the
crystals, the change, in fact, being almost n7/ when rubidium is the alkali metal
replaced by either ammonium or thallium. While no clear rule like that of eutropic
progression can apply as regards ammonium (or thallium), there are still very definite
relationships which have been established as the result of the research now completed,
which can best be stated separately for the various properties.

Crystal Angles.—The monoclinic axial angle 8 of the ammonium salt of any group
(set of salts containing the same M-metal) is usually very close to that of the caesium
salt of the same group. In six of the eight groups, those in which all four salts (of
NH,, K, Rb, and Cs) are capable of existence, the difference is less than 10’, and in three
cases it does not exceed 2’. The change in this important angle when K is replaced
by Rb is usually about a degree, and when Cs replaces K about 2 degrees, the latter
being almost exactly twice the former, the angular changes corresponding to the two
