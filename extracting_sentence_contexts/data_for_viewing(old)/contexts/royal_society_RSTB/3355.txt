the subject will be treated of in detail, so that further reference to Stocks’ work will
not be given here.

One of the most important points in connection with the calcareous nodules in
the coal is to determine their relation to the coal (itself), in which they are found
embedded. Hooker and Binney (’54) state that “ A section of these nodules shows
a confused mass of decayed and apparently decaying vegetable remains; they
present no appearance of these remains having been brought together by any
mechanical agency ; they appear to be associated together just as they fell from the
plants that produced them ” and that therefore the nodules represent
samples of the plants forming the seam, This is the view generally accepted by
paleobotanists. It must be noted, however, that neither Hooker and Brxney nor
their followers have proved this to be the truth, no definite facts have been brought
together and marshalled so as to show that the plant-containing masses are not drift
material brought in from some other source. On the other hand Lomax ( : 02) states
definitely that his experience in the mines leads him to believe that “the various
portions of plants have been carried to their present position after being broken in
fragments, and before petrifaction, or they have been carried from a parent bed after
petrifaction,” thus bringing forward an opposing view, which, if proved, would make
it clear that the “coal balls” do not contain representative plants of the coal
in which they are found, but have been derived from another locality, possibly even
from an earlier epoch. It is of prime importance to determine which of these two

views is correct, for upon our interpretation of the facts depend all the theoretical
considerations and the conclusions which are to be drawn from the structures found
