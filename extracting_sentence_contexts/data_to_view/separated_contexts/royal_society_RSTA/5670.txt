It suggests that external and effective anisotropy fields are much a)
weaker than the exchange one that is typical for most measurements. Also, it is supposed that Dy
a characteristic time of the applied field changes is much larger than the decay time of the [8
precession of the sublattices magnetization vectors. In fact, this means that the theory is applicable Da
up to frequencies of several tens of kilohertz. Within the developed framework, a special axisymmetric case, where external field is applied
strictly along the anisotropy axis of a particle, is considered in detail. Certainly, this configuration
is in a sense ideal and requires special efforts to be realized in experiment.
