The right ventricular wall
after birth, it will be remembered, is only half the thickness of the left (Plate XV. compare Cd" with c d of fig. 51). 'This view seems probable from the fact, that the sep-
tum in some places (Plate XV. fig. 50, cd') is nearly a third thicker than the left ven-
tricular wall (cd) between the papillary muscles (x, y)â€”an excess in breadth which very
nearly corresponds with what would be obtained when allowance is made for the right
and left halves of the septal duplicature passing through each other, until the central
layer in either is reached, and for the atrophy of the right half of the septal fold as
suggested. ;
