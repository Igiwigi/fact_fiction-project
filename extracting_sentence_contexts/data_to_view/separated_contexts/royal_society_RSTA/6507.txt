There are also, compared to the TP case [11,22,23],
few studies investigating design principles of PI mechanisms. One important study of stripe
formation [52] found a set of network architectures capable of producing stripes. One
fundamental question that has so far received only limited attention is whether the networks
capable of producing TPs are fundamentally distinct from those capable of producing PI patterns;
or if they are in fact related. At the level of network structure—which by itself does not suffice to constrain the system
dynamics [53]—there appears to be some overlap in the motifs found in different contexts [11,52]. A more thorough analysis of different detailed mechanistic models [54], however, suggests that
there are indeed considerable similarities between models producing TPs and models embodying
PI.
