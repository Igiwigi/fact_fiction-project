One can see the temporal representation of the
reconstructed signal in figure 7b, which looks very similar to the original excerpt (cf. figure 7a). An auditory comparison confirms how close the two signals are to each other (cf. electronic
supplementary material). In terms of post-processing, for both the RV and Delaunay-based methods, note that when the
modes are harmonically related, one can benefit from the fact that the instantaneous frequencies
of harmonic components are multiples of the fundamental frequency to gather together basins
of attraction/mode domains associated with a given mode. Note also that this pertains to the
problem of reconstructing trajectories of partials in the context of additive synthesis [30]. This is
a topic that we will seek to address in the near future.
