But these transfers are of men having roundly about the
= same skull capacity, and I think that generally we may feel quite satisfied with the
E accordance of the two series.* Now the average capacity of the first eighteen
4 anatomists is 1601 cub, centims., and of the last seventeen anatomists is 1468 cub.
3g centims. There is thusa most substantial difference.t Yet he would bea bold man who
S would assert that there is a substantial average intellectual superiority in the first half. E Tn fact, a number of most capable men fall into the last nine, and J. KoLLMANN, one of
Â© the ablest living anthropologists, has absolutely the smallest skull capacity ! My second list contains the estimated skull capacity of twenty-five members of the
teaching staff of University College, London.
