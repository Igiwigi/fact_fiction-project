It is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics that the product of the standard deviations
of two non-commuting quadrature operators can never be smaller than 1—this is stated by the
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the foundation of quantum mechanics:

AX, - AX > 1. (2.3)

Coherent states are so-called minimum uncertainty states. This means that the product of
the standard deviation of the amplitude quadrature and the standard deviation of the phase
quadrature is minimized, i.e. (here) equal to 1. It is actually more common to quantify the
uncertainty of a variable X in terms of its variance A?X, which is the square of the standard
deviation AX. For a coherent state, the size of the variance of the amplitude and the phase
quadrature is identical, shown by the fact that the uncertainty distribution is spherically
symmetric. This is somewhat of a special case.

The product of the variances of two non-commuting variables can be larger than or equal
to 1, but never smaller. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, however, does not state that the
variances of the uncertainties of the two non-commuting variables have to be identical. The
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle can obviously also be fulfilled if the uncertainties are not equal
(e.g. for 2 - 3 =1, or for 3 -5=1, or even for 10- 3 >1).

So-called squeezed states fulfil the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in this way. The process
of squeezing deforms the round ‘noise ball’ (as shown on figure 3b) into a noise ellipse, hence
the term squeezed states. This does not imply that the laser mode now has a different shape—it
means that the uncertainties in the two quadratures have been redistributed, leading to a change
