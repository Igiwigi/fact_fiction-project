as is invariably the case with a paralyzed bell of Sarsia in normal water. Later on
during the soaking stage four or five successive contractions may be yielded in response
to a single mechanical stimulus, and shortly after this a whole bout of rhythmic con-
tractions may be started by the same means. Indeed, in s0me cases the artificial
rhythm in acidulated water requires such a single additional stimulus for its inaugura-
tionâ€”the shivering movement failing to begin spontaneously, bub beginning imme-
diately upon the application of the additional stimulus. Similarly, after the shivering
movements have ceased, a fresh bout may very often be started by again giving the

motionless nectocalyx a single stimulation. The interpretation of these facts would
geem to be that the general irritability of the excitable tissnes is exalted by the universal
and constant stimulus supplied by the acid to an extent that is jusb bordering on that
which gives rise to rhythmic movement, 80 that when the violent contraction is given
in response to the mechanical stimulus, the disturbance serves to start the rhythmic
movement.

If a paralyzed nectocalyx, while manifesting its artificial rhythm in acidulated sea-
water, be suddenly transferred to normal sea-water, the movements do not cease
immediately, but continue for a considerable time. This fact can easily be explained
by the very probable, and indeed almost necessary, supposition that it takes some time
after the transference to the normal sea-water for the acid to be washed out from
contact with the excitable tissues. Sooner or later, however, as we should expect, in
