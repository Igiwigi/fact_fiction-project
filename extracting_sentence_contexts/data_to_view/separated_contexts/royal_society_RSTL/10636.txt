The interval of time between the
taking of the photographs was not more than half a minute. The calcium lines were
strongesb at the metallic or negative pole. The following facts have been established by the foregoing observations :â€”

When carbon or metallic electrodes are moistened the 8hort lines are lengthened,

With very few exceptions the non-metallic constituents of a salt do not affect the
8park spectra of solutions. Tnsoluble and non-volatile compounds do not yield spark 8pectra. The 8olution of a metallic chloride yields spectral lines identical in number and
position with the principal lines of the metal itself.
