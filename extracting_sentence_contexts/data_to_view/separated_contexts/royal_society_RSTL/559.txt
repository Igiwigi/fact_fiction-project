It will not require perfect crystals; for,
when crystals separate into lamine, which subdivide into frag-
ments, and shew the form or arrangement of their molecules,
it is easy, from such fragments, to connect them with their pri-
mitive crystal, and consequently with their class. It will be
a great step, to obtain one regular and permanent external cha-
racter. Attention to other characters will be necessary, to as-
certain the nature of the substance; and other external charac-
ters, such as irregular fracture, colour, &c. must be resorted to,
where no permanent characters exist; but from their nature
they are fallible, and in fact are seldom conclusive. The progress of crystallography appearing to me of conse-
quence to the progress of mineralogy, induced me to desire the
Count de Boukrnon, abovementioned, one of the honourable
victims to his allegiance to his King, to describe such crystals,
in my collection, as shewed the different known modifications
of Corundum; which will develop the theory of crystalliza-

tion, 50 far as is consistent with the avowed object of this
Paper. The subject, I believe, has not hitherto been submit-
ted to the consideration of this Society.
