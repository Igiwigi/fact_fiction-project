On reference to Plate XVI. fig. 7 it will be seen that in this ship the
Qcentral part of the curye MM falls below the axis, thus indicating the fact that about
30 feet of the midships length of the ship is subjected to a very small sagging-moment, of
which the maximum value does not exceed 170 foot-tons, although the excess of weight
over buoyancy amounts to 210 tons. A very small deduction from this excess of weight
would suffice also to convert this sagging-moment into a small hogging-moment. For
example, suppose 10 tons only to be taken from the excess, and a weight of 4 tons to be
placed 150 feet before the poxition from which the 10 tons were taken, while the re-
maining 6 tons are placed 100 feet abaft it.
