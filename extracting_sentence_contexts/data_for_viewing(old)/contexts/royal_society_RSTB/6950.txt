In addition, two differences concerning the back of the skull will be mentioned:

(7) The great reduction in size of the squamosal.

(8) The different attitude of the occiput.

It is possible to offer explanations for some of these changes which are correlated
with changes in the relations of the jaw muscles with the skull. In this section of the
paper views are advanced which are admittedly largely hypothetical, but which lead
to some consideration of functional implications of the structural changes. In this
attempt to put flesh on dry bones the authors have necessarily felt less closely bound
to factual evidence, and there is little doubt that some of their suggestions will be
challenged. It should be insisted therefore that this section of the paper is not intended
as additional support for the previous conclusions, but is intended to direct attention
to certain new or little-understood problems in the transition from the Theriodont to
the mammal. In certain cases deliberate emphasis has been placed on hypotheses
which seem to be at present incapable of proof, in the hope that other workers may
have a concrete case to argue.

Notes on jaw musculature

It is well known that the areas of origin and insertion of muscles are variable, so
that evidence of homology of bones derived from the study of muscles is not very
reliable, and their use has been made difficult by a confused nomenclature. Also,
