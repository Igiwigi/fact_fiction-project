observable, because it seemed obvious that if the body which thus put on so suddenly
the chromospheric spectrum were single, it might only weigh a few tons or even
hundredweights, and being so small might be very near us. We are driven, then,
from the idea that these phenomena are produced by the incandescence of large
masses of matter because, if they were so produced, the running down of brilliancy
would be exceedingly slow.

“ Let us consider the case, then, on the supposition of small masses of matter.
Where are we to find them? The answer is easy: in those small meteoric masses
which an ever-increasing mass of evidence tends to show, occupy all the realms
of space.

“The Nova now exists as a nebula, so far as its spectrum goes, and the fact
not only goes far to support the view I have suggested as against that of ZOLLNER,
but it affords collateral evidence of the truth of THomson and Tatt’s hypothesis of the
true nature of nebule.

“The nebular hypothesis in its grandeur and simplicity remains untouched by
these observations, the facts, so far from being in direct opposition to it, help us, I
think, all the better to know exactly what a nebula is.

“There is another point of extreme interest to the spectroscopist, if we accept the
bright line observed in the star by Dr. CopELanp and others to be veritably the chief
nebula line.
