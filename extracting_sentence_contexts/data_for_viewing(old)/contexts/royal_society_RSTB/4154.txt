We know that this process takes place in other Sarcodina, notably in Arcella,? in

Trichospherium,® and in Euglypha,' as an alternative to amcebula and flagellispore
production, and it is probable that the Foraminifera in which the phenomenon has
been observed likewise vary their reproductive processes. Of these, Trichosphzerium
possesses the greatest interest for us, for it is essentially marine, and it is by the
study of this organism in the living condition that the actual course of the process is
most likely to be revealed.

So revolutionary a theory as this must be emphasised at the outset by a clear
demonstration of the evidence, and fig. 27 (Discorbina parisiensis) is put forward in
support of the hypothesis. Every rhizopodist who has observed the process hitherto
known as “ plastogamy” has called attention to the fact that of the associated pairs,
one is, in the majority of instances, of strikingly inferior size to the other.°

Tn selecting the specimens for reproduction in fig. 27, I have sought for them only
in Dr. J. J. Supson’s material from the Kerimba Archipelago, in order that there
may be no question as to latitude or environment to account for the disparity in the
sizes and development of the associated pairs. It may be remarked that an equally
complete series of the same species might have been picked out of the material from
Bognor, Sussex, upon which EARLAND made his observations in 1905, or from the
Clare Island district, where we noted the occurrence of these associated pairs in
considerable numbers and gave a figure of a typical instance,® or, indeed, from any
