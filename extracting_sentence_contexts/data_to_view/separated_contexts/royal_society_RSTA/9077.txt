Perhaps we should stop at 33345 as the next link 14929, like the one referred to
above, is 7°70 too small. But the next e link is too small for e(—é,) by about the
same amount, and the two together have the appearance of a parallel inequality. The
abnormality however may possibly be due to the fact that the separations are due
to differences between one line by Eprr and VALENtA and others by Exner and
Hascnek. If this be granted the next comes right with e(—3d,) = 17264°03 with error
dy = 07. Again starting from 8, there is a collection of meshes, chiefly of e. ‘They illustrate
the variations from normal links chiefly in link @ A noticeable peculiarity is that in
most of these meshes a line is linked by v to one corner, in all cases » being from 3 to
4 below its normal value.
