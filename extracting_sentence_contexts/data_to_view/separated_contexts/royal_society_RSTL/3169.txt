Sciences Brussels, &c. &c.

Read April 21, 1881. ON presenting the following remarks to the attention of the Royal Society,
I feel it necessary, first, to apologize for their not possessing that degree of
scientific novelty which is generally expected in such communications,—and
secondly, that in enforcing my argument, I may perhaps seem to give more
value to my own investigations than is consistent with good taste. I must,
however, either in some measure do this, or leave the evil untouched, which
I feel it my duty to endeayour to remove ; and therefore, trusting to a liberal
interpretation of my motives, I shall state without reserye such facts as
appear necessary to establish the object I have in view, and it is hoped the
want, of noyelty will be compensated by the importance of the subject under
consideration. That a ship's compass is subject to a deviation from its true direction in
consequence of the attraction of the iron used in the construction and appoint-
ments of the vessel, is now too generally admitted to require any argument,
although I believe there may be still some few officers who are sceptical on this
point ; I have at least been seriously assnred by one of rank and long standing,
that there certainly was no local attraction when he was at sea.” Now there
is really more in this observation than one would imagine, for there can be no
question that forty years back the error arising from this disturbing force was
very inconsiderable to what it is at present ; every year in fact increasing
the amount, and rendering a correction of the error more and more necessary.
