lies in the widespread agreement of experiment with the predictions of the theory and in the
interpretation of the elastic behaviour of the materials in terms of their known structure. The
same factors have contributed to our appreciation of the limitations of these assumptions.

The principal problems, which the theory seeks to solve, are the determination of the
deformation which a body undergoes and the distribution of stresses in it, when certain
forces are applied to it, and when certain points of the body are subjected to specified
displacements. These problems are always dealt with on the assumption that the generaliza-
tion of Hooke’s law is obeyed by the material of the body and that the deformation is small,
i.e. the change of length, in any linear element in the material, is small compared with the
length of the element in the undeformed state.

Apart from the fact that the generalization of Hooke’s law is obeyed accurately by a very
wide range of materials, under a considerable variety of stress and strain conditions, it has
the further advantage that it leads to a mathematically tractable theory.

Even if the elastic materials, which it is wished to study, did not obey accurately the
simple law postulated but varied in their elastic properties, one from another, there would
still be some justification for developing a mathematical theory on this hypothesis. For, it
would clearly not be possible to develop a separate mathematical theory, to any considerable
extent, based on the known law for each material with which we may be required to deal.
The simplicity of the generalization of Hooke’s law makes it a peculiarly suitable basis for
a mathematical theory which can be regarded as strictly applicable to an ideal material.
The departures of the elastic behaviour of any particular material from the generalization
of Hooke’s law are then regarded as reflexions of the departure of the material from the ideal
