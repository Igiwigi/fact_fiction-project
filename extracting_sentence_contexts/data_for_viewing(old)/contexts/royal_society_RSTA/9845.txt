8 km. in the cyclone but not till 12 km. in the anticyclone.

All these particulars have been noted in the Continental results, but not in so
pronounced a manner. It will be seen in the line “ A-C,” in Table VII, that in
England at a height of 7 km. the difference amounts to 15° C. In Messrs. Goup and
Harwoop’s report the greatest difference occurs rather lower and only reaches 8° C.
This is for barometric heights of below 750, and over 770, but the number of
observations on which the figures depend is not stated. Dr. WAGNER gives 18° C. at
8 km., but his values for the centre of a cyclone depend on two ascents only.
M. RykatcHEW gives much smaller differences, but the barometric heights are not
defined in either case, the tables being simply headed “ cyclonic” and “ anticyclonic.”

About the actual fact there is no doubt; it was stated by M. TrrsszRENC DE Bort
long since. It would be of interest to know if the distinction is more pronounced in
England than on the Continent, but the question is somewhat involved. Cylones of

any depth are rare on the Continent, except perhaps at Hamburg and Pawlowsk, so
that the opportunities for studying it are not so good there as here.

The Isothermal Region.

It will be noticed in the tables previously given that the decrease of temperature
mostly ceases at a height of about 10 or 11 km., but tables showing mean values do
not fairly indicate the nature of the phenomenon. In nearly every individual ascent
