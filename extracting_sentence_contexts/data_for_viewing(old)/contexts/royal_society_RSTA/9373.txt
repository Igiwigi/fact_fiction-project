compared with the finite loss of energy due to an infinitesimal viscosity at a surface
of discontinuity in a gas.*

If these views are correct we should expect that Lord Raynuren’s result would
not apply when there are no bounding planes and space is filled with a fluid in which
d?U/dz is everywhere positive ; for, in that case, there would be nothing to prevent
a positive amount of 2-momentum from being communicated to every portion of the
fluid, provided the disturbance increases indefinitely for infinitely great values of z.
In obtaining his result Lord Rayierau assumes that, if there are no bounding planes,
w = 0 at infinity ;{ it does not apply therefore to the case just considered.

The conclusion arrived at is that the discrepancy between RAy.LerGcH’s and
Reynotps’ results is due to the fact that the perfect slipping at the boundaries
assumed in Ray1ercH’s work prevents the escape of the momentum which is a
necessary accompaniment of a disturbance of a fluid for which d?U/dz is everywhere
negative. The complete absence of slipping assumed in Reynoups’ work enables
the necessary amount of momentum to escape, and so a type of disturbance may be
produced which is dynamically impossible under the condition of perfect slipping at
the boundaries.
