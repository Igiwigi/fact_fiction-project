It is known* that another pure contravariant is possessed by two ternary quadratics ;
its symbolical expression is

(aa'x) (ab’c’) (a’be) (beu) (b’c'u).

DIFFERENTIAL INVARIANTS OF SPACE. 299

Denoting this by D, we ought to be able to express D algebraically in terms of the
seven preceding forms; as a matter of fact, D®? is a polynomial combination of the
forms.

18. The preceding determination of the differential invariants of the specified
order has been based upon a knowledge of the complete system of concomitants of
two ternary quadratics. When we pass to higher orders, the last stage in the
determination of the differential invariants could be completed without further
calculation, if we knew the complete system of concomitants of certain simultaneous
ternary quantics some of which are of order higher than two. But, in general, such
Bhowledge i is not at present possessed ; in its absence, some other method of attaining
the end is necessary. Such a method can be devised in connection with the differential
fuations ; as applied to the two quadratics, it is as follows.
