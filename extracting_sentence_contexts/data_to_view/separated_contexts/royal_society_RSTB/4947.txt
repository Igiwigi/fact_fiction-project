60 (Plate 13). In the latter there are only three canals in the year succeeding
the wound, and yet there is a double series of numerous canals in the wound year itself. When the vertical extent is compared, the prevalence of local series in the young plant
will be recalled, and the further fact may be instanced that, though the wounding of
the young nursery plant (fig. 4) was very severe, none of the response to wounds was
carried into the innermost year to any great extent except in the case of the nodal
regions between Nos. 7-8, in and below which there were several severe wounds. Even
here, after the canals were established at the base of the year (No. 8), their number
rapidly decreased, as may be seen in Nos. 10 and 11.
