for connecting the mathematical model with the chemical and biological features of the genetic
code. The third aspect concerns the coding strategies used in the different domains of life. Each
strategy has an observed minimal number of adaptors needed to implement it. We show that
such numbers can be obtained exactly by means of our non-power modelling. In §4, we present
the conclusion and further perspectives.

2. Background and history

Since the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA by Watson and Crick in 1953, many
mathematical hypotheses regarding how proteins are coded have been proposed [2]. Among the
most remarkable are those of George Gamow (crystal model [3]) and Francis Crick (comma-free
codes [4]). Despite the fact that both hypotheses were experimentally proved incorrect [5], Crick’s
proposal indicated clearly that coding theory is ‘the’ framework for interpreting the mechanisms
of protein synthesis. We quote here the words of Gamow ina letter to Watson and Crick [6, p. 10]:

[I] think that this brings biology over into the group of ‘exact’ sciences [...]. If your point
of view is correct, and I am sure it is at least in its essentials, each organism will be
characterized by a long number written in quadrucal! system [.. .]

Gamow trusted that this digital representation of genetic information would have opened a new
era in the understanding of life.

Somehow, in the following years, the interest in a mathematical description of the genetic code
faded away, and subsequent studies were more targeted to explain features of the code mainly
