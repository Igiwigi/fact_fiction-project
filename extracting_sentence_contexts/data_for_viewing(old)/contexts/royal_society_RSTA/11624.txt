lines, as regards the appearance, velocity, duration, &c., of the streamers, could be
studied at leisure. Descriptive notes on the photographs reproduced are given at
the end of the paper, and in the following account I shall confine myself to describing
the general conclusions which follow from the examination and comparison of the
whole series, referring when necessary to the figures in which the best illustrations
of them can be seen.

Durations of Lines.

The durations can best be studied quantitatively when there is no inductance in
series with the spark gap beyond that of the connecting wires. The period of the
oscillations is then extremely small, and the whole spark from an electrical point ot
view is over before the image is appreciably drawn out on the plate. The fact that
nevertheless the metal lines are always drawn out shows that their vibrations last an
appreciable time after the stimulus which has excited them has ceased ; this time is,
moreover, very different for the different lines.

We may take as an example the magnesium spark, fig. 24 (Plate 3), the luminosity
of the triplets (5183, 5172, 5167) in the green (nearest the top),* and (3838, 3832,
3829) in the ultraviolet (both unresolved of course), lasts at least four times as long
as that of the line \ 4481, which itself has a duration of 16 micro-seconds after the
actual spark has ceased. The two triplets are prominent arc lines, 4481 is the well-
known spark line, absent from the are under ordinary conditions. When a little
inductance is inserted in the sparking circuit, as in fig. 25, the difference in the duration
of the lines makes itself evident in another way. With \ 4481 the streamers are
