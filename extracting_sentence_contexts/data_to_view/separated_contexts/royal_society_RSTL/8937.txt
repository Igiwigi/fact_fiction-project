Though at present unable to see my way to the acceptance of
=] this doctrine in connexion with the origin of extinct plant forms, T am anxious to place
S on record all the facts which my studies in palzo-botany supply which appear to
5 support that doctrine. HHitherto the difficulty of explaining the transition from the
S ordinary types of fibro-yascular cells and vessels to that of the discigerous types has
2 been one very great hindrance to my accepting the doctrines of the evolutionists in
S reference to fossil plants ; this one difficulty, at all events, has now been removed. But,
= its removal is also an important fact bearing upon another branch of the present inquiry. bf M. BroxGxtarr, Dr. DawsoN, and Professor NEWBERRY have long held the view that
2 many of the Sigillaric and a large group of allied stems were those of Gymnospermous
1 plants. The two first distinguished palzeo-botanists also believe that many of the forms
E of Calamites, which they recognize under the name of Calamodendron, are also members
E of the 8ame Gymnospermic family.
