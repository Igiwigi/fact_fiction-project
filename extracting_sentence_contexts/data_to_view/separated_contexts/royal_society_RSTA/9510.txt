V. SOUTHWELL ON THE GENERAL THEORY OF ELASTIC STABILITY. Any of these methods is valid for the investigation of elastic stability, and all have
in fact been employed, the displacement considered being that of the central-line or
middle-surface of the rod or shell, and the resultant actions over cross-sections being
derived in terms of this displacement, by the approximate theory first suggested by
Kircunorr. The third method is generally found to be preferable, and is the basis
of the investigation to be described below, but the actual procedure will be found to
possess one or two novel features. In the first place, an endeavour will be made to dispense with the assumption that
elastic break-down occurs at very small values of the strains ; instead, we shall deal
with an ideal material possessing perfect elasticity combined with unlimited strength.
