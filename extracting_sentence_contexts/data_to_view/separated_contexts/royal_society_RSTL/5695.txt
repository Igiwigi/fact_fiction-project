It fortunately happens, that we have, in the transparent web of the frog's foot, an
opportunity of observing with the utmost facility the circulation of the blood in the
living animal, and of watching the effects produced upon it by irritating causes. It
may naturally appear very doubtful whether observations made upon creatures $0 low in
the animal kingdom as the Amphibia, can with propriety be brought to bear upon human
pathology. A few facts will, however, suffice to show that no such doubts need be enter-
tained. If a portion of moistened mustard be placed upon the web of a frog, tied out
under the microscope, the blood-vessels will s00n be found abnormally red ; and if the
application be continued long enough, all the capillaries will become choked with cor-
puscles 80 closely packed as to present the appearance of a uniform crimson mass ; and
by and by the epidermis will be found raised in the form of a blister over the part oh
which the mustard lay. These effects are precisely similar to those which we have Seen
to be produced by it upon the human skin; and before effusion has taken place, the
vessels of the affected part exactly resemble those of the congested spot of inflamed p18
mater aboye described.
