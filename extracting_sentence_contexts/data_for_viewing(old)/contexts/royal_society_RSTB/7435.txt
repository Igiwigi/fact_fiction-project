a polychaete, but more usually the proliferating area in Onychophora and Arthropoda -
either succeeds the blastopore in time or replaces it, and hence is termed a blastoporal area.
When no blastopore is present or when it is obliterated early, mesoderm arises from the
blastoporal area. Concerning the forward growth of mesodermal bands in the Onycho-
phora: their development is simpler than it is in most annelids as well as arthropods, see
next section.

Primary and secondary metamerism in segmented animals, and the primitive character
of the Onychophora
Much has been written recently concerning primary and secondary segmentation
(Iwanoff 1928, 1933 and 1944; Snodgrass 1938), which Iwanoff (1944) claims to have the
significance of a new principle of morphology. A review of this theory seems called for, as
the facts appear to be open to a somewhat different interpretation.

* Neither Nair nor Manton has observed any extra blastoporal immigration in the Malacostraca, other
than that of the pre-antennulary mesoderm which comes from the germinal bands.


EARLY EMBRYONIC STAGES OF PERIPATOPSIS 547

Iwanoff has drawn attention to the ‘primary larval segments’ in Annelida, Arthropoda
and Enteropneusta, etc., arising in a manner unlike that of the post-larval or ‘secondary
segments’ which comprise most of the adult body. Snodgrass follows this up by attaching
a phylogenetic significance to these ontogenetic phenomena, and interprets them as
indicating the manner in which metamerism may have arisen in evolving segmented
