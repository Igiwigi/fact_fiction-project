Had I directed my telescope to the 8ame
point of the horizon a little s0oner, I should have seen the two
images, before. the. ship itself was, visible. In fact, the images
were. visible, when the whole ship was .actually below the ho-
rizon;; for, from the very small part of the mast which was at
first- visible, that part must then have been below the horizon,
and appearedabove it by-the usual refraction ; the altitude of a,
above the horizon, having-then been much less than the in-
.crease. of altitude which arises from the common horizontal
refraction. .
