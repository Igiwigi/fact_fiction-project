200. The rock thus crushed transfers a portion of its own mass from a greater or less
depth to the surface, and frees the cavities from which it is ejected of s0 much bulk,
permitting them thus to close in and accommodate the dimensions of the shell to those of
the shrinking nucleus beneath ; but the mass is only transferred, it is not lost ; and the
transfer might haye no effect whatever on the length of the day, even were its mass far
greater.

Nor is the volume of rock crushed (to perform the volcanic work) necessarily all
ejected; from any one point, on the contrary, much of it may cool again # sitr with
extreme slowness, and get recompacted into solid rock.

201. The writer believes, however, that a considerable proportion 7s cjected, and that
this is, in fact, the function or final cause in the cosmos of vulcanicity. It is the means
whereby a contracting solid crust gradually, and, though paroxysmally, on the whole
harmlessly, adjusts itself to the dimensions of the nucleus shrinking away from beneath
it; and were it not for this provision in the grand machine, or were the solid crust 80
rigid and constituted that its parts could not locally crush up, and the crushed matter
be cleared out and thrown up to the surface, prodigious paroxysmal convulsions must
result, with perhaps ages intervening between them, which would probably overturn
the whole economy of the snrface upon which the existence of organized life is now
dependent.

Admitting fully within what wide limits of error estimates snch as these alone
admit of being made, the writer yet snbmits that he has proved to a high degree of
