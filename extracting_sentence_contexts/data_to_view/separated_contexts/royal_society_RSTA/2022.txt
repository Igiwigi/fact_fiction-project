Furthermore, solution (3.22) can be used for finding the distance reached

by the front of the permissible contaminant concentration for the entire period of the process. Denoting by Cj the value of permissible solute concentration and by Xq the distance from the


fracture inlet to the point where concentration is equal to Cg, from equation (3.22), it follows that

If the corresponding concentration of the contaminant in the surrounding porous matrix is
also of interest, then using the system of equations (2.38)-(2.41) and assuming that concentration
in pores does not depend on time gives

Solution of the problem (3.24)-(3.26) is as follows:
Cyly) = Clade“ @""*/YPa, (3.27)

where C = (c/Cg) and Cy = cp/Co . From solution (3.27), the maximal distance reached by the front
of permissible concentration, yq, in the porous matrix can be readily obtained:

From (3.28), it follows that the maximal depth of penetration of radioactive solute in the porous
matrix is attained at X =0, i.e. in the place where it is a constant source of contamination.

andy > 1

For the moments of time of the order At=O(1) and y — 1, applying formula (3.17), equation
(3.12) can be converted to the following form:

Owing to the fact that At=O(1), it is reasonable to introduce a new temporal variable T = At
in equation (3.29). For the values t= T/A, when T = O(1), the concentration front will move to a
distance greater than | along the fracture. Therefore, a new characteristic scale Xo for the variable
should be introduced.
