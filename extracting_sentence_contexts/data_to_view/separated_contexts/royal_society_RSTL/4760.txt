For such illustrations, electro-magnets
are extremely appropriate, as in them, except during the motion by which any
alteration in their form or arrangement is effected, no appreciable inductive action
can exist. 5. In selecting from the known phenomena of magnetism those elementary facts
which are to serve for the foundation of the theory, all complex actions, depending
on the irregularities of the bodies made use of, should be excluded. Thus if we were
to attempt an experimental investigation of the action between two amorphous frag-
ments of loadstone, or between two pieces of steel magnetized by ordinary processes,
we $hould probably fail to recognize the simple laws on which the actions, resulting
from such complicated circumstances, depend ; and we must look for a simpler case
of magnetic action before we can make an analysis which may lead to the establish-
ment of the fundamental principles of the theory. Much complication will be
avoided if we take a case in which the irregularities of one at least of the bodies do
not affect the phenomena to be considered.
