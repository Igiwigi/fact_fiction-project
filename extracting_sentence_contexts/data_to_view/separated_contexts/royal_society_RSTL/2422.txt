A ſaturated |
ſolution of ſalt in water put into the room, was found to |
heat morequickly, and toan higherdegree, than purewa-
ter, probably becauſe it evaporated leſs; but it could not
be brought to boil till oil was added, by means of which
it came toward evening into briſk ebullition, and confe-
quently hadacquired an heatof 230*. Some rectified ſpi-
ritof wine ina bottle flightly corked, which had been im-
merſed into this ſolution of ſalt whilſt cold, began to boil
in about two hours, and ſoon afterwards was totally eva-
porated. Perhaps no experiments hitherto made fur-
niſh more remarkable inſtances of the cooling effect of
evaporation than theſe laſt facts; a power which appears :
to be much greater than hath commonly been ſuſpected. The evaporation itſelf, however, was more conſiderable
in our experiments than it can be inalmoſtany other fitu-
uation, becauſe the air applied to the evaporating ſurface
was uncommonly hot, and at the ſame time not more
charged with moiſture than in its ordinary ſtate. A pow=
erful afliſtant evaporation muſt undoubtedly prove, in :
keeping the living body properly cool, when expoſed to
great heats; but it can act only in a gro/s way, and by no |
means in ſuch a nice proportion to the momentary exi-
gencies of the animal as would be requiſite for the exact
preſervation of its temperature: that other proviſion of '

nature which ſeems more immediately connected with
the powers of life, is, probably, the great agent in pre-
ſervingthe juſthalanceof temperature; exertingagreater
effort in'proportion as the evaporation is deficient, and a
leſs effort as the evaporation increaſes.
