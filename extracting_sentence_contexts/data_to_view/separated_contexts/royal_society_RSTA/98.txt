Like the base of a wine bottle discussed earlier, this potential has a maximum at ¢=0,
and minima around a circle. So the ground state, in this case the vacuum state |0), breaks the [=
symmetry. In fact, we have a degenerate vacuum state; we can have :

for any value of a. : w
Suppose we choose one particular value, say a =0, thus making the expectation value real, Ye
and write ¢ as the vacuum expectation value plus real and imaginary parts: a

Then, substituting into V, we find

y= Amigt + cubic and quartic terms, (5.4)

where m= n?. The mass of the g; boson representing radial oscillations is determined by the
curvature of the potential in that direction. But in the transverse ¢» direction, the potential is flat,
and the corresponding boson is massless.
