normal inheritance, not in its mode, but in the nature of the characters which give it
phenotypic expression. It may be more correct to attribute the phenomena in Limnca
to “ accelerated character determination ” than to “ deferred nuclear action.”

VI. ANOMALIES.

We have shown that the quality of sinistrality is the product of a gene, that this
gene is a simple recessive to its normal allelomorph which produces dextrality, and that
the phenotypic product of this allelomorphic pair is delayed for one generation, so that
segregation appears among the broods in a group and not, as in direct inheritance,
among the individuals in a brood. This definitely implies that all the snails in any
one brood should be of the same twist. If, as we believe, this simple system provides
a reasonable explanation of the primary facts of our line-breeding and crossing, then
the occurrence of single broods containing both phenotypes or of dominant broods in
recessive lines is anomalous and implies either a breakdown in the system or the presence
of other factors that modify its expression.

There are three main groups of occurrences which are thus apparently anomalous,
and owing to the extra attention which has been paid to them they figure in the pedigree
tables of the line-breeding with disproportionate frequency :—

(1) E broods, mainly (and genetically) sinistral with a varying proportion of dextrals,
are quite common ;

(2) F broods, mainly dextral with a few sinistrals, are much less frequent ;
