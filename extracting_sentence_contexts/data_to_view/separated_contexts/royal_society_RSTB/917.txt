This admixture of fluid is so striking sometimes that the
gested body may be termed vacuolate ; its border is always sharp and unbroken ;
sfhize (and @ fortiori its mass) is less than the ordinary size of a food ball,
ped by recent aggregation. This difference is of course a difference of degree,
WB a qualitative peculiarity becomes obvious almost at once in the fluid of the
Bole of digestion. I have tried to represent this in fig. 8, and to show that after
h@ first gathering of granules slight opacity in the outlying fluid hints at the
pRearance of fresh solid matter, There is, in fact, a second movement shortly ; little
Wize of clear fluid appear round the edge of the vacuole (fig. 8, 1c), and the opacity
fits contents becomes slightly accentuated ; later, a gelatinous mass retracts, with
lv centripetal motion, and settles round the “nucleus” formed by the first quick
ngvement (1, d), The substance separated thus by the second action is generally
mogeneous, and often difficult to see ; in rare cases, the preparatory turbidity of the
rapuole, of which I have spoken, is exaggerated to granularity, and when this is so,
= shrinking solid is granular too (fig. 8, 2c). I have said that this second
*raction is slow, indeed it may be many minutes after ingestion before the double
Phere lies fully in clear fluid ; rarely, however, there is an approach to the rapidity
of primary aggregation. I think that the rate of movement, the extent of retraction,
and the consistence of the second shrunken mass depend upon the existence of a
certain balance, in the proportion of soluble and suspended matter first ingested,
and upon the amount or energy of the substance causing retraction, which is passed
from the surrounding protoplasm into the vacuole.
