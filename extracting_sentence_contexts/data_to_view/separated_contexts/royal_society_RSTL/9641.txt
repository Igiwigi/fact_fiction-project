G. Z1MMERMANN, in a letter to one

£ of the editors of the * Jahrbuch fiir Mineralogie,' 1861, p. 557, proposed the name

g © meteorine” for a new metal occurring in the Cranbourne meteorite which he found
S to contain no copper, nickel, or cobalt, The 8ubstance referred to in both cages was
£ evidently the little plates above deseribed. As the composition of this mineral has
# now for the first time been definitely made out, I propose to call it Edmondsonite, in
© memory of the late GeoRGE EDMONDSON, the Head Master of Queenwood College,
S Hampshire, a great lover of science ; a man with whom IT had the honour to be long
S and intimately connected.

- A curious accident should here be described which established the fact that the alloy
is a definite chemical compound. A number of pieces of nickel-iron from this meteorite
which had become rusty were heated in a porcelain tube in a current of hydrogen. During the progress of the experiment, which was conducted out of doors, it came on
to rain, and some drops touched the hot tube and cracked it.
