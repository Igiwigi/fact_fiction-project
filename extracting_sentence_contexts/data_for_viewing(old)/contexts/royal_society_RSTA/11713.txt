where V, is that free electrostatic potential which is continuous with the surface
value $wec(x®+y°)+A at the conductor. Inside the conductor this purely
zthereal displacement involves an electrification of volume density p= — we/270”,
which will be a density of free electrons or ions as all true electrifications are ; while
there is a compensating surface density o equal to the difference of the total normal
electric displacements on the two sides, that is to (410*)“! (dW,/dn, + dv,/dn,),
where dn, dn, are both measured towards the surface, the outside medium being
air for which K is unity. The value of the constant A is determined by the cireum-
stance that the aggregate of this volume and surface charge shall be null when the
conductor is insulated and unelectrified, or equal to the given total charge when it is
insulated and charged: when it is uninsulated, the constant is determined by the
position of the point on it that is connected to Earth, and therefore at zero potential.
The procedure of Part II., § 25 is thus justified, because there is in fact no dielectric
polarization in the conductor, but only ethereal displacement.

It remains to consider whether the parts of this volume density p and surface
density o of electrification are carried round with the conductor in its motion, or slip
back through its volume and over its surface so as to maintain fixed positions in
space. It is clear (as in Part II., § 27) that the same cause, namely, viscous diffusion
of momentum among moving ions and molecules, which produces OHMIC resistance
to a steady current, will lead to the electrons constituting electric densities being
wholly carried on by the matter whenever a steady state is attained. This necessary
consequence of the theory is in keeping with Row1anp’s classical experiments on
convection currents. The excessively minute magnetic field due to these convection
currents themselves has been neglected in the above analysis, which has enabled us
