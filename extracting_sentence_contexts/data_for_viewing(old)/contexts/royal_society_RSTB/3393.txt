variation in the capacity of different ova for the absorption of this food. Whether
this variation in the power of absorbing nutriment is a sexual characteristic or not
he does not satisfactorily show ; indeed, the histological evidence he offers leads me
to believe he is, in some cases, dealing unknowingly with degenerate ova, and this
portion of his paper I judge is not wholly to be relied upon. The statistics he
offers indicate that such may be found to be the case, and that feeding the mother
with lecithin may result in the birth of a very marked excess of females. But what
looks at first sight to be clear proof of this is found to be open to grave suspicion,
for the instances he makes use of, both in his original paper (1907 A) and in a further
one (1907 B) dealing with the same subject, appear to be selected cases, and it is
impossible to be assured they are truly representative (confer BATESON, 1908).

But however this may b√© from a sex point of view, the fact remains that he
shows a variable power of assimilation among ovarian oya.

Regarding the relative power of vitality of the sexes, it is true that, so far as our
present knowledge actually shows, there is no surety that fertilised ova of either sex
are specially subject to death in their early stages of development. For this reason
it may be claimed that the premature death of embryos while in the egg does not
appreciably affect the ratio of the sexes produced by any animal.

T am disposed to believe that further physiological enquiry will show that this view
is wrong. Manuscript notes by the late Sir Evererr Minnais in my possession
