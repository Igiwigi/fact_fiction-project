more acute in the posterior limbs. In their oscillations the limbs thus all beat towards
the hind end of the food groove, and I believe that large particles are gripped by the
comb sete of the second to sixth endites and passed in this direction. The comb sete
it will be remembered, project inwards and backwards while the filtratory sete project
directly backwards. Large particles will therefore be caught on the tips of the stout
comb sete and will not come into contact with the more lateral filter sete.

The last twelve limbs, or thereabouts (there are twenty-seven trunk limbs in all),
show a gradual but marked change in structure from the more anterior limbs. The filter
sete on the second to sixth endites lose their filtratory armature of setules and become
brush sete, that is, the setules project all round the sete. They are naturally shorter
as the limbs themselves are shorter and also more crowded and this makes them more
robust, ‘The comb setze similarly are much shorter and are, in fact, powerful claws.

The gnathobase shows the most marked change in structure. It becomes relatively

much larger and actually larger than the second endite. ‘The conspicuous triangular
claw process diminishes so that its base, from which the filtratory sete arise, becomes
more and more terminal until at about the twentieth or twenty-first limb the claw process,
as such, does not exist, while the blunt claws which terminate the claw process become
actually larger and point medially rather than anteriorly. The filter sete, brush sete
and collecting set, all diminish rapidly in numbers from the fifteenth limb backwards.
Extra claws appear on the median face which may represent transformed collecting
