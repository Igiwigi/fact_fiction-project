Heliopors the * Dorsalftcher” are all turned towards the axis of the colony and directed
z upwards 1s also a new fact. The zooids in their structure seem to conform very closely
to those of Pennatulids (Sarcophyllum, e. g.); but to the list of distinctive differences
between the zooids and polyps of Pennatulids given by KGL1KER, viz. the absence in
the zooids of tentacles, the presence of two mesenterial filaments (the dorsal ones), the
absence of generative organs, and the shortening of the hypogastric region to such an
extent that it fuses with the anastomosing canal-system—to these marks of distinction
must be added, in the case of the zooids of Sarcophyton, the fact that four of the
mesenteries, the dorsal and ventral pairs, are deeper than the others.

It seems extremely difficult to reconicle the extraordinary succession of the mesen-
teries in the deyelopment of the Zoantharians, discovered by Lacaze-DuTaHIERs, with the
facts presented by Alcyonarians. Did the development of the eight mesenteries of Alcyo-
naria correspond with that of the first eight mesenteries formed in Actiniade, the first
mexenteries formed would be either the lateral dorsal or Jateral ventral; but these are
those which are most rudimentary in the zooids of Sarcophyton. Moreover the mesen-
terial filaments of the two lateral pairs of septa are in the development of Actiniade
the first to appear, and not the dorsal, which are longest in the Alcyonarian polyps and

F * An examination of the Cornulariade, the only recent solitary Aleyonarians, might very possibly throw
light on the question of the affinitics of the Rugosa.
