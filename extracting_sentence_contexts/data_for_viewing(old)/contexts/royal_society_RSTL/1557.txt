since the territories of the two belligerent powers were pro-
bably separated by the river Balys (which was the case in the
subsequent reign, although we have no authentic information
that it was so at the period now under consideration), and as
the battle was probably fought on the confines of these two
empires, I think it will be evident from the preceding extracts,
that no solar eclipse could be the one mentioned by HEero-
DoTUs, unless it was central and zota/ in some part of Asia
Minor; that 1s, the centre of the moon's shadow, in such total
eclipse, must have passed over that part of Asia Minor where
the contending armies were engaging. Consequently the
fact is capable of being verified or disproved by the present
state of our knowledge in astronomy.

M. TH. S. Bays is the first who seems to have fixed the
attention of the public to this point, in a paper entitled Chro-
nologica Scythica, inserted in the Petersburg Memoirs for the
year 1728. He consulted his friend FRED. Curis. MAYER on
this subject, who has shown, from the astronomical tables then
in use, that neither the eclipse mentioned by PLiny, SCALIGER,
CaLvisivs, PETAVIUs, or USHER, could possibly be the eclipse
alluded to by HeropoTus. For, the first two (he says) hap-
pened between the hours of sun-set and sun-rise in Asia
Minor. In the third, the centre of the moon's shadow passed
