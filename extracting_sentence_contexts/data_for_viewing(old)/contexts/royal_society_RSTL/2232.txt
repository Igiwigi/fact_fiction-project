Obſervations in ElefFricity. 133
21mall wire; the balls 'then appearing, on examination,
'w be little more than the /co77 of the metal. The effect
of electricity, lightning, and fire, in deſtroying the power

of the artificiabor natural magnets, is a circumſtance that
hath been often remarked, and repeatedly publiſhed.
The effects of electricity, in common with fire, on proof-
Apirit, gun-powder, phoſphorus, dry lint, and many other
Jubſtances, muſt occur to every gentleman converſant” in
heſe experiments; indeed the parallel might be conti-
Sued much further. But it may be'aſked, if this be
Jeally the fact, ſhould not metals become electrical by
Friction? I anſvver, they are readily excited, provided they
Þe firſt properly infulated; (but if metal be rubbed
Zgainſt metal, the phlogiſton or latent fire, if I may be
Allowed the expreſſion, is ſo nearly proportioned in the
So metals, that the equilibrium is reſtored as ſoon as
'Heftroyed, from the very nature of the baſe, which is the
Inoſt perfect conductor we are acquainted with) to il-
ate this, let it be remembered, that though the
hg paradox may be readily explained, yet the
Avid muſt be confined in a proper” veſſel; and
though the weight, the ſpring, and the 'compreſlibi-
