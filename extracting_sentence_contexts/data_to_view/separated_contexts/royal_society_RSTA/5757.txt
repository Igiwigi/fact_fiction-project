As
with other subtle matters, the devil is in the detail. In what follows I provide selected lists of ideas
concerning what the theorems say—and do not say.

(a) (Mis)interpretation of Penrose’s theorem

Sometimes the Penrose theorem is interpreted as definite proof that black holes form in
gravitational collapse. This is incorrect and the actual fact is much more subtle. The assumption
of the existence of a trapped sphere does not state anything about the formation of black
holes, rather it uncovers (some of) what happens inside black holes once they are formed! This follows from a theorem [14,29] stating that, in asymptotically flat space-times, no closed
trapped surface can be seen from infinity, in other words, the trapped spheres are enclosed
beyond the event horizon of the black hole, and thus they are already inside black holes already
formed.
