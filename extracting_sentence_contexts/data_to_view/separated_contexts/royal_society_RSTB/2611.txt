Radial longitudinal section through wall and septum of Galazea.
c.th. = centre of calcification in the theca.
c.ér, = centre of calcification in the septal stria or trabecula. Little fibrous deposit is seen on the inner side of the dark line in the wall, whereas
on the outer side, long fascicular groups extend to the serrate costal ridge, which is
present on the outer surface of the wall between two septa-costal ridges, The
shadowy line in the drawing giving apparent continuity to the dark centres and axes
in the median plane is an attempt to reproduce the effects got by changing the focus
of the microscope. SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF THE MADREPORARIAN TYPES OF CORALS. 121

The transverse sections, fig. 5 and fig. 6, show apparently contradictory facts
regarding the relations of the “dark lines” in wall and septum. In fig. 5 they are
drawn separated from one another, in fig. 6 they appear continuous. The same
corallite varies in this respect in Galaxea at different parts, according to the relative
rapidity of growth between septum and wall.
