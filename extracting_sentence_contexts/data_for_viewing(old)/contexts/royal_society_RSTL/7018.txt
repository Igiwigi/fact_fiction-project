(the dentate convolution, H.), is present, but very small, the fascia dentata being only

zjust recognizable. The middle internal temporal convolution (1-1) (pli temporal moyen

Zint6rieur, GR. ; uncinate, H.), continuous upwards by the narrow ridge (+) with the

convolution of the corpus callosum, and ending forwards in the wnciform tobule (ww)

Sllobuls de Vhippocampe, GR. ; and crochet of Vicq D'AzYR), is relatively narrow and less

Zprominent in the Bushwoman's brain, the crochet being particularly small. The 7ower

= temporal convolution (99), which in fact is the same as the lower external temporal, and

2is marked off from the middle one by the parallel fissure of GramroLem (2-2) (collateral

E fissure, H.), is very broad, though smooth. The secondary sulci of these convolutions

E are chiefly longitudinal, and more simple than in the European brain. The middle con-

Z yolution (19), that above the collateral fissure, is traceable round the very tip of the

x occipital lobe, and, curving upwards on its hinder aspect, joins the middle and lower

Z V occipital convolution; the lower one (9) unites more directly with the lower occipital
