Indeed, many Sexes game will know that this is true, know that the other
interesting games have several such equilibria. Consider, for knows it, etc.; and hence both will spontaneously choose A,
example, a simple ‘coordination game’ (figure 1c) in which, not B, alighting on the (A,A) equilibrium.
unlike PD or Matching Pennies, the players’ interests align, So far, one might wonder whether, rather than engaging
rather than conflict. Here, there are two ‘pure strategy’ equili- in bargaining, both players are simply choosing the equili-
bria of (H,H) and (T,T) (and, in fact, a further ‘mixed strategy’ brium of the greatest summed pay-offs. For example, rather
equilibrium, where both players choose by spinning a fair coin). than seeing the players as bargaining to achieve a solution,

In social interactions that can be modelled as a game we might consider the players to reason instead as part of a
with multiple equilibria, producing predictions about what ‘team’ whose objective is to maximize the total pay-off to
players should choose requires selecting one equilibrium the team members (see [8,9]). However, consider figure 1f,
among others.
