another cyclone hits. Farmers are also affected by problems of market access and
price volatility. Despite the fact that most farmers in the study
regions do not produce enough rice to feed their families, 84%
of households sell some of their crop immediately following
the harvest to cover the costs of inputs and basic household
needs. Later in the year, when their rice reserves run out,
these same families typically buy back rice in the market,
often at higher prices—a phenomenon that is common across
Madagascar [8]. Rice prices are generally the lowest immedi-
ately after the harvest, and the highest during the lean season
when farmers buy rice back to feed their families [18], thereby
reducing the ability of farmers to purchase food.
