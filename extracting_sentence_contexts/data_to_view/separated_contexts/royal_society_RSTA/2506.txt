These both contain corner-linked octahedra (ZrOg and YOg¢) and tetrahedra (WO,). Analysis of
the phonons by ab initio lattice dynamics calculations suggest that in both cases the low-frequency
dynamics are associated with rigid body motions of the WO, tetrahedra, and that the Zr-O bonds
are relatively stiff, but that there is allowed bending of the octahedral bond angles [52,53]. Here,
I point out the important fact that in the general case (perovskites being the exception) systems
consisting of octahedra within the network will be over-constrained and no RUMs are possible
[54]. ZrW2Og is in principle allowed to support RUMs because one of the vertices of each WO4
tetrahedra is not connected within the network [55]. I will make further remarks about ZrW2Og
below (84d).

(c) Flexibility in metal-organic frameworks

The issue of analogous RUM flexibility in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has hardly been
explored, but one simple system that has been studied—Zn(CN),—might point to some
interesting warnings.
