that the fibres of the vitreous body are attached, as shown in figs. 12 and 13. It is
possible that these fibres may be a further extension of the supporting elements of
the retina into the cavity of the eye, but the examination of Sphenodon A (fig. 12),
where they are very sharply marked off from the caps of the sense-cells, hardly
supports this view.

In this connection I may call attention to the appearance represented in the
section of the very young pineal eye of Embryo 24a (Stage Nâ€”O), represented in
fig. 31. Even here one or two very definite-looking strands are seen stretching
across the cavity of the eye from the lens to the retina. These certainly look like
normal structures, but no doubt, even at this stage, the cavity of the eye contains a
certain amount of albuminous fluid, and the strands in question may be due to
coagulation. In fact, a reticulum, formed presumably by coagulation, is already
present in the primary parietal vesicle represented in fig. 29.

The occurrence of nuclei, scattered sparsely in the vitreous body, has already been
mentioned. These are no doubt partly extruded from the lens with the vitreous
secretion, as already described, but they may be in part derived from another source,
viz., the wandering pigment-cells, as previously suggested, and here again we must note
that nuclei may occur in the coagulum, even in the primary parietal vesicle (fig. 29).

The vitreous body is usually free, or nearly free, from pigment, but occasionally
