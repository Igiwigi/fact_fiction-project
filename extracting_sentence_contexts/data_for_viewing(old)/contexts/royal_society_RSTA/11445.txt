Negritos. We seem, therefore, justified in assuming a neolithic pygmy race in
Europe having a stature about the same as that of the Andamanese. Whether the
actual stature of this race was for the female nearer to 144 centims. (Py) or
141 centims. (Fl) it seems to me impossible to ascertain definitely until we have
more trustworthy and extensive measurements than yet exist of the living stature
of extant pygmy races.

(28.) Conclusion.

The formuls and curves for the reconstruction of stature which are given in this
memoir, must by no means be taken as final. No scientific investigation can be
final ; it merely represents the most probable conclusions which can be drawn from
the data at the disposal of the writer. A wider range of facts, or more refined
analysis, experiment, and observation will always lead to new formule and new
theories. This is the essence of scientific progress. All, therefore, which is claimed
for this paper is (i.) that it exhibits a better theory of the reconstruction of stature
than any which has so far existedâ€”it might not be too much to say that nothing
which can be called a theory has hitherto existed; (ii.) that it determines the
constants of the formule given by that theory as well as the existing data allow of ;
(iii.) that it gives values for the probable statures of prehistoric races, which have
far less divergence among themselves, whatever be the bone or combination of bones
