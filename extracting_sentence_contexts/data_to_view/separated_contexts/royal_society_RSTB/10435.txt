Examples
include correlations between mammalian biodiversity and
global biogeographic patterns of human infectious diseases
[115], elevated likelihood of observing emerging infectious
diseases [97] and increases in human pathogen richness and
prevalence for some diseases [116]. However, in these cases
it can be difficult to separate cause from correlation as areas
with high levels of biodiversity are also characterized by
other, unrelated, risk factors for disease transmission such
as climate and poverty. Nevertheless, the fact that most
human infectious diseases have origins in animals, mostly
wildlife, supports suggestions that these correlations are
mechanistically reasonable and that one large-scale conse-
quence of biodiversity loss could be an overall reduction of
disease transmission. Wildlife biodiversity loss can, however, also increase dis-
ease risk. In some ecosystems the number of transmission-
competent hosts is ‘diluted’ by abundant non-competent

hosts, so the chance of a vector feeding on a suitable host,
or of a motile infective parasite successfully contacting a
transmission-competent host, may be reduced.
