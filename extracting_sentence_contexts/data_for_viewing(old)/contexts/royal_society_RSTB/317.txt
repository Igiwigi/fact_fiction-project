points of exit of the first and second nerves. The section is in the transverse plane
of the cord. Fig. 2, Plate 4, gives an example of another such cell from the lower part
of the lumbar enlargement of the Human cord. The cell does not lie far out from the
limiting edge of the grey cornu. It is much smaller than a neighbouring cell belonging
to the superficial region of the cornu. The cornual cell can be seen to give a branch
into the same bundle of transverse fibres as harbours the smaller and out-lying cell.
Similar cells I have observed to occur in both the cervical and in the lumbar regions
of the cord, and have seen examples in the Monkey and Cat, as well as in Man and
in the Dog. They have somewhat the appearance of being aberrant members of a
group of cells which occurs scattered in more or less broken fashion along the deeper
part of the mesial edge of the ventral grey horn, and best seen just above the lumbar
enlargement. ‘This group was called attention to in the Human cord by Prox,* and is
characterised, according to him, by the fact that the cells give off large processes into
the fibre-bundles of the white commissure.

The references to out-lying cells in the anterior column which I have been able to
discover are three. The earliest by Torquato Bertsso in 1878 ; he figures a specimen,
which was obtained from the cord of the Ox. He writes,t “ La figura dimostra come
una grossa cellula bipolare contenuta nell’ intreciamento della commissura mandi un
prolungamento che ripiegando si perde fra le fibre pitt mediane della sostanza grigia.”
A second reference is by ScurerrerDEcKER.{ In speaking of the structure of the cord
in the lumbar region of, apparently, the Canine cord, he writes that he has found
occasional cells in the white commissure, sometimes bipolar, but more often “shaped
like arrowheads.” He was, it would seem, not aware of the observation by Bersso.
A third reference is by Pick,§ who, after describing the cells of the ventral cornu
