The first key ingredient is the reformulation of the Stratonovich equation in It6 form

aT = («AT + £gT) dt +} wy VT AW,

where
(LoT)(x) = 7 uj(x) - V(uj(x) - VT(x)).

One has
Lo =LQ.

This is a well-known fact, see for instance [19]; indeed

The second sum is equal to 3 Wa pet Qup (x, x)dadgT. The first one, due to the property div uj =0,
is equal to
