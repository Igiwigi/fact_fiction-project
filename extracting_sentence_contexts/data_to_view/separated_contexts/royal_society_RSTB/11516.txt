As a result, they ought to predict the
very same data that Ward et al. find. And, indeed, Bronfman
et al. make essentially this point in reply to [28]. The fact that
the data cannot decide between two quite different theories
here simply underscores the methodological problem at the
heart of this paper—a problem that cuts both ways.

5. No-report paradigms

A number of authors have expressed optimism that so-called
‘no-report’ paradigms, which attempt to investigate aware-
ness in the absence of explicit reports, will uncover the true
neural basis of consciousness, and so resolve the methodo-
logical puzzle. Tsuchiya et al. [54], for example, emphasize
no-report data in making their case that the ‘activation and
structural integrity of the frontal areas seems to be neither
necessary nor sufficient for conscious perception’ (p. 762)
