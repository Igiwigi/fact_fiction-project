That which might perbaps have appeared to be in oppo-
sition to the admission of this idea, is the fact of the frog contracting from very
feeble currents. It is very easy to overthrow this difficulty. In fact, I may dis-
pense with any further repetition of experiments by recalling Voura's opinion in
support. Immediately after Garvanr's first discovery, VoLra applied himself to the
study of the action of the discharge of the jar upon the nerves of frogs and other
animals; and in his very first memoir upon Animal Electricity, he declares that the
prepared frog is without comparison the most sensitive electrometer we POSSESS. In
one of his experiments he found that a charge at all times sufficient to excite con-
tractions could not be estimated at the 5th of a degree of his straw electrometer.
