as the process of regeneration progresses and their substance is needed. ‘The cells
that actually build up the new tissues are, however, not the trophocytes themselves
but minute cells that arise from the epicardial lining. In particular, they arise
from the two lateral corners of the epicardium, fig. 3 D.

Species—Tylobranchion speciosum HeERpMAN. Fig. 4

Source of material—Type colony in British Museum, from the Challenger
Expedition near Kerguelen Islands.

Remarks—The type colony alone is in good condition and available for examina-
tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids within the colony are distended
with developing embryos precludes any possibility of obtaining more than a
fragmentary view of the process of budding, for sexual and asexual modes of repro-
duction are not mutually compatible. There is some evidence, however, that the
colony in question was taken near the end of the sexual breeding season, with a few
zooids entering the asexual phase.

The zooids are smaller and the colony more pedunculate than Diazona and the
relationship with the synoicids even more pronounced. In fact, the zooids resemble
those of the synoicids in the presence of a true post-abdomen containing heart and
gonads.

Formation of buds—The great majority of zooids in the colony are breeding
