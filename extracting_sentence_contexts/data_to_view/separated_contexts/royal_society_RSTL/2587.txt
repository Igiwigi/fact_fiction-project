by several writers under the title of arciform filaments, though their termination in the
cerebellum remained undiscovered. See fig. 1. 8.

* Mr. Henmzagr Maro is, I believe, the only author who points out the fact that the restiform bodies are
partly formed by some fibres from the posterior part of the cord, but anterior to the posterior lateral fissure,
and therefore not olely by the true posterior columns. In the second edition of his Outlines of Physiology,
P. 273, he says, * On cutting through and stripping down the corpus restiforme, it is found to carry with it
the posterior lateral furrow.”

ramidal bodies, are separated from the posterior fibres of the antero-lateral columns,
already described as ascending to the cerebellum, by fibres which occupy a place in
the middle of the side of the cord. 'These fibres, which subsequently ascend through
the pons Varolii to the cerebrum, and form the upper portion of the crus cerebri, have
lately been described by Sir CHarLEs BELL as a portion of the tract of sensation.
