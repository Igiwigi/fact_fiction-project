b. Weights of the Encephalon and its parts.

The entire encephalon of the Bushwoman, hardened in spirit and deprived of its mem-
branes, weighed 21-77 oz. 'The loss of weight in specimens of brain preseryed in a similar
way I find to be from one-third to one-fourth, 5. e., as a mean, yFths of their original
weight, on which calculation the recent Bushwoman's brain, deprived of its membranes,
would weigh exactly 30-75 oz. With the membranes, the weight would be about 31:5 0z.

The capacity of the skull, as already stated, was equal to 35 0z. avoirdupois of water,
or 60:64 cubic inches. If the brain, in its natural state, filled the cranial cavity as com-
pletely as water will afterwards, it would be easy, by taking the specific gravity of
nervous substance as compared with water, to estimate the quantity of brain which once
occupied any given skull; but the fact that this is not the case, especially in regard to
the base of the brain, and the difficulty of determining the weight of the membranes,
the amount 'of blood which the vessels may contain, and the quantity of cerebro-spinal
fluid which fills the ventricles and all otherwise unoccupied spaces, render it impossible
thus to arrive at 80 definite an estimate as in the other way.

Now the smallest healthy European female brain recorded by WAGxER weighed about
31-7 oz.4; and the 8mallest observed by Dr. Retro, in the case of an aged woman, 32 oz.
These numbers, however, are unsatisfactory, as neither the heights nor the weights of
the individuals are on record. But Dr. Boy's valuable Tables) supply this omission,
and thus 'enable us to appreciate the comparative size of the Bushwoman's brain.
Among 149 females between the ages of 60 and 70 years, the minimum weight of the
