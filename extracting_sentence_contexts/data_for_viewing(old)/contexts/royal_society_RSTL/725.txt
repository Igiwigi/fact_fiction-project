blished opinion respecting the bal-ams and benzoic acid to be erroncous. For the
balsams are defined as bodies composed of resin and benzoic acid ; consequently the
latter, when obtained in a separate state, is considered as an original ingredient or educt.

I am however inclined to a contrary opinion, for I consider the balsams as

peculiar substances, which, although nearly approaching to the nature of resins, are
nevertheless different in respect to the original combination of their elementary prin-
ciples, which combination however is with much facility modified by various causes,
and especially by a certain increase of temperature, so that a new arrangement of the
elementary principles takes place, part being formed into resin, and part into benzoic
acid. ,
Many facts appear more or less to swpport this opinion ; for whether benzoic acid is
obtained by simple sublimation, or by merely digesting benzoin in boiling water, accord-
ing toGeoryroy's method, or by the addition of lime, as recommended by Scnzt1e,or
by employing alkalis in a similar manner, nothing positive can be inferred from any
of these operations to prove that benzoic acid is obtained as an educt, but rather the
contrary, when we reflect on the affinities which are most likely to prevail under the
circumstances of the different processes, and on the yariable proportions of*the benzoic
acid ; and although benzoic acid has been discoyered in the urine of infants, in that
of many adults, and constantly in that of graminivorous quadrupeds, such as the
camel, the horse, and the cow, ( Sys!eme des Connoissances Chimigques, par FourÂ»

being a chemical product,
