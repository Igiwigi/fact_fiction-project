of temperature normalized to the Josephson energy, kgT/E ij from the fit we get kgT* =
4.9(14)Ejv/ve â€” 0.4(4)E;. This could be a further indication that the observed measurements
are in agreement with the crossover from thermally assisted phase slips to QPS. However,
the agreement with the theory is only qualitative, since the theoretical expectations for the
exponent a have not been confirmed. In particular, the experimental exponents q are interaction
independent and they are of the order of unity [51], whereas the theoretical exponents depend
on the interaction and they can be an order of magnitude larger than the measured exponents
[34]. This disagreement could be due to the range of velocities explored, much larger than
in the theory, and to the lattice strength, much lower than in the theory [34]. Nevertheless,
new theoretical studies performed in the regime of shallow lattices have demonstrated that the
experimentally observed v-independent regime is well described by a TAPS mechanism [36].
By predicting the damping rate G induced by thermally activated phase slips in the regime
of low velocity and weak interaction, in fact, the theory shows a good agreement with the
experimental values, thus suggesting the interpretation of thermal activation in the v < v* regime.
Furthermore, the damping rates measured with large velocity and large interaction, whose
values are definitely larger than the calculations with the TAPS assumption, strongly suggest a
quantum activation of phase slips in this regime. The experimental results are thus compatible
with the TAPS to QPS crossover. However, the quantitative comparison between theory and
experiment in the QPS regime, necessary to demonstrate the nature of the observed crossover, is
still missing.
