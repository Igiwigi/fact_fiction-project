They are usually a dark green, and so heavily pigmented
that in unbleached sections no structure can be made out, not even the surface
cuticle. Plate 2, fig. 3, shows a section of a wing-case which has been bleached with
chlorine. The surface cuticle, which now appears, seems to be rather thick, notwith-
standing the fact that the colour disappears fairly soon, if the beetle is polished with
carborundum. Sections of other Buprestids show a very similar structure when
treated in the same way, except that the surface cuticle sometimes tears away,
though remaining a single layer. If it were not for the fact that the colour disappears
with very varying rapidity on polishing such wing-cases as these, it would seem as if
the layer which produces the metallic colour must lie on the surface, for, as in the
dragon-fly, Newrobasis chinensis, LINN. (p. 53), the chitin is so heavily pigmented
that if the colour-producing layer were more deeply seated, nothing would be seen,
because of the intervening black pigment.
