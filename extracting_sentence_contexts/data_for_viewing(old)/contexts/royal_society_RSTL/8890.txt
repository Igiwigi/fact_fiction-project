hand, if the specimen operated upon be one which is in a fresh and vigorous state,
its period of quiescence will probably be but short ; the nervous shock (if we may 80
term it), although evidently considerable at the time, s0on passes away, and the animal
resumes its motions as before. In the great majority of cases, however, the activity
of these motions is conspicuously diminished.

The effect of excising all the marginal tisxue from between the eye-specks and
leaving the latter untouched is not s0 definite as is the effect of the converse experi-
ment just described. Moreoyer allowance must here be made for the fact that in this
experiment the principal portion of the © veil” is of necessity removed; s0 that it
becomes impossible to decide how much of the enfeebling effect of the section is due
to the removal of locomotor centres from the nectocalyx, and how much to a change
in the merely mechanical conditions of the organ. From the fact, however, that
excision of the entire margin of Sarsia produces total paralysis, while excision of the
eye-specks alone produces merely partial paralysis, there can be no doubt that both
causes are combined. Indeed it has been a matter of the greatest surprise to me
how very minute a portion of the intertentacular marginal tissue is sufficient, in the
case of this genus, to animate the entire nectocalyx. Choosing vigorous specimens of
Sarsia, T have tried, by cutting out all the margin besides, to ascertain how minute a
portion of intertentacular tissue is sufficient to perform this function, and I find that
this portion may be s0 s8mall as to be quite invisible without the aid of a powerful
lens. As it not unfrequently happens that in cutting out the extreme margin of
Sarsia a minute part of the intertentacular tissue is left behind accidentally, I may here
caution any one who repeats the fundamental observation upon this genus to be yery
careful in remoying every atom of the marginal canal.
