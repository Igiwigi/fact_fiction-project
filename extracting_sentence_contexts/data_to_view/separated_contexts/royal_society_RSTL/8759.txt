warps and Ham placed these corals (Stylasteracea) under the Oculinide. Grar,
however, established a family (Stylasteridz) for the genus Stylaster alone. Povrratis,
who in his *Deep-Sea Corals' dwells upon the many peculiarities of the corallum of
this family, places under it the genera Allopora, Stylaster, Distichopora, Cryptohelia *,
Lepidopora, and Errina, The peculiarities in the structure of the soft parts, and the
relations of the tentacles to the septa, described in this paper as occurring in a Stylaster
and a Cryptohelia, and the similar facts observed by Sas in the genus Allopora, strengthen
the facts brought forward by PourraLts, with regard to the coralla, in a very potent
manner. I hope to make a elose study of the structure of Stylaster. 'The apparent
absence of mesenteries is most remarkable, and a similar condition appears to occur
also in Millepora. The number of tentacles and septa in the Stylasteride seems hardly
to follow the usual hexameral law.
