In the myenteric plexus, MULLER describes two types of cells distinct from those forming
the sub-mucous plexus. Both these types of cells possess short dendrites which end
either on the neurones in the ganglion of origin or in club-like expansions on the muscle
fibres. From these facts, MtLirr suggests that the intrinsic fibres forming the fibre-
tracts in the myenteric plexus are axonic, whereas in the sub-mucous plexus they are
chiefly dendritic. Err Miuier (51) also supported the view that the neurones of the myenteric and
sub-mucous plexuses conform to two morphological types and described cells similar
to two of the types of Doaren. He believed that cells of Type I are vagal in origin,
those of Type IT (and in this category he included the “ interstitial cells of CasaL”’),
sympathetic.
