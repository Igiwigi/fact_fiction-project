and the velocity displacement by
|€|=2rA/a = |dp|[(ap.) =als|. . . . . . . . (10)

One of the most important results arising from the fact that waves of small
amplitude are propagated with a constant velocity independent of their intensity is
the application of the principle of superposition of vibrations. By the use of FourrER’s
Theorem it is proved that a periodic disturbance of any wave form may be analysed
into a number of simple harmonic waves whose sum gives rise to the complex
disturbance considered. It is thus sufficient in the case of sound-waves of ordinary
intensity to consider the propagation of a simple wave, as discussed in equations (3)
to (10).
