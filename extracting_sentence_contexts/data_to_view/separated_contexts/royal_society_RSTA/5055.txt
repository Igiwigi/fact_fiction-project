The DVV method
is explained and further elaborated and tested in Gautama et al. [28-30] and Mandic et al. [31]. A
separate paper in this Theme Issue tests DVV for floating platforms and the potential of its use for
tracking changes in structural properties is identified there [32]. Advantages of using this method


relate to the facts that it does not require any prior knowledge about the system or the excitation,
it is robust to the presence of noise, it is straightforward to interpret and typically exhibits
improved performance over other traditionally available methods [30]. Numerical analyses were
performed using the DVV toolbox [33]. The output of the method is one number for each
response signal recorded, shown by the root mean square error (RMSE), and represents the degree
of nonlinearity of the response [30].
