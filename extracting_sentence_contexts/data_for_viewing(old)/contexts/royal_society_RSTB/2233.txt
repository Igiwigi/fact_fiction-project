(Morr). The interruption of the synapses may unbridle these “motor” cells and
render them hyper-excitable, while at the same time it occasions not only paralysis
of voluntary movements, but hyper-reflex excitability by blocking the discharge of
afferent impulses in the cerebrum. Risten Russecrf states that, after a unilateral
section has been made of the posterior columns of the spinal cord, the cortex on the
opposite side to the lesion discharges movements which are less powerful and more
tetanic in nature. It is not easy to bring this result in agreement either with that
of Morr and SHERRINGTON or with my own results. I have noticed that the
movements excited from the anszemic cortex are often more convulsive, but not as a
rule less powerful. It must be very difficult to divide one posterior column without
damaging the adjacent pyramidal tract. RussEt1’s results may be due to the lesion
of this tract. The fact that cortical discharge, produced in myself by compression of

voluntary movements” occur, such as grasping a raisin.
