On the other hand, the prosenchymatous layer (&) is very thick :
this thickness is due to the appearance of a large double vascular bundle, snrrounded
by a considerable mass of parenchyma, which is lodged in the substance of the prosen-
chymatous layer. Two of the vertical prosenchymatous laminee, seen at #, }', have obvi-
ously been pushed aside to make room for the aboye intrusive structure. I have already
mentioned the fact that I have never seen any of the cortical bundles located in the pro-
senchymatous zone of the bark, save in one solitary instance, the latter reference being
to the example now under consideration. The double yascular mass (2) bears 0 striking
a resemblance to these bundles when but partially divided, as to leave little doubt that
it is really one of them. At the first glance we might suppose that it had been acci-
dentally displaced from its normal position and forced, by pressure, into the outer bark ;
but such is certainly not the case.
