Here the thermometer No. 1 rose 64 degrees, in 10 minutes,
when its c-nire was placed 2 inch beyond visible light.

In order to have a confirmation of this fact, I cooled the
thermometer No. 1, and placed No.2 in the room of it: I also
put No. in the place of No. 2, and No. 1 in that of No. g;
and, having exposed them as before, arranged on the second

_ line, I had the following result.
