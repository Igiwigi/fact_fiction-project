constraints, such as top of atmosphere radiative balance [28]. The issue of the stability of ANNs
when integrated into a coupled system is also under active study at the moment (e.g. [69]).
The question of whether tightly coupled subsystems should be jointly or separately learned still
remains an open question.

5. Climbing down the ladder: prospects for ML-based Earth system models

We have highlighted in this article a historical progression in Earth system modelling, which we
describe here as the addition of detail to our models, in the form of resolution and complexity.
While this has resulted in tremendous leaps in understanding, there have been some aspects
where we have failed to advance for decades. In most accounts, this can be traced to failures in
representation of the form of sub-gridscale phenomena such as clouds. The solution may come
when we in fact no longer need to seek representations, as we shall be resolving such phenomena
directly. We have noted possible setbacks to this approach given physical limits on computing
technology.

We have gazed into the computational abyss before us, and seen how ML may offer ways to
adapt to what todayâ€™s machines do best, which is statistical ML. It is a transition in our approach
to predicting the Earth system that is potentially as far-reaching as that of von Neumann and
Charney, algorithms that learn rather than do what they are told. How this will unfold is yet to
be seen.


At first glance, it may appear as though we are turning our backs on the von Neumann
revolution, going back from physics to simply seeking and following patterns in data. While such
