Of these, some have already received consideration in Parts I and III (pp. 420, 425
and 443); others require additional experimental evidence before they can be correctly
evaluated.

(1) The expansion of the sternal plates. It is obvious that if the plates grew more rapidly
than the intervening ventral body wall they would eventually meet in the mid-line.
This simple explanation of their union is unlikely, however, because, as already pointed
out in Part I, it would not account for the rotation of the plates from an oblique to a
vertical and finally to a horizontal position (cf. figs. 5â€”7, Plate 33 and figs. 8, 9, Plate 34).
That union is not due primarily to the expansion of the plates was finally proved by
the experiments described in Part III, in which the ventro-lateral body wall containing
the sternal plates was grown in vitro with the result that the plates moved to the mid-line
and fused. Displacement of each plate as a whole was demonstrated by the fact that
the distance between the outer (costal) margins diminished as well as that between the
ventral margins; had union occurred by expansion alone, the latter distance only
would have lessened.

(2) The elongation of the ribs. The ribs fuse with the sternal plates fairly early in
development, and their growth keeps pace with the downward movement of the plates.

It was theoretically possible, as stated in Part I, that the elongating ribs might push
the sternal plates towards the mid-line. This possibility, however, was eliminated by
the experiments quoted above, since the sternal plates in explants of the ventro-lateral
body wall moved to the mid-line in the complete absence of the ribs.
