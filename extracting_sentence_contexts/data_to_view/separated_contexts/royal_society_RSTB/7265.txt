Intra-vitam staining with methylene blue (Smith 1946) confirmed the view that the
starfish motor system consists essentially of the two series of bilaterally and metamerically
arranged hyponeural and lateral motor neurons, both of which were found to have con-
nexion with the subepithelial association tracts of the ectoneural system by way of fibres
which penetrate the substance of the body wall. The tube feet and ampullae, the mode of
innervation of which had not previously been known, were moreover shown to have both
hyponeural and lateral motor connexions. Owing, however, to the fact that observations
were made on whole mounts of pieces of tissue made opaque by the calcite contained
within them, it was not possible to trace either the anatomy of the connexions nor the
nature of the motor endings on the muscles in any detail. Meanwhile (Smith 1945, 1950) experimental studies on the nervous control of the move-
ments of the foot had suggested a scheme of innervation which would provide for the
protraction, retraction and 360Â° range of co-ordinated directional locomotory stepping. OF ASTROPECTEN IRREGULARIS (PENNANT) 523

This scheme, while consistent with the known anatomical picture, presupposed certain
additional details of arrangement and interconnexion of the hyponeural neurons with
neurons seen to be contained within the cavity of the foot for which there was no anatomical
justification.
