More accurate theories of decision-making are desirable not
only from a scientific perspective but also from the perspective
of public policy, including regulation. In some domains such as
financial markets, regulation of goods and services is premised
on rational-actor models. That is, consumers are assumed to
make rational choices in the sense of Savageâ€”despite the fact
many decisions consumers face have high degrees of compu-
tational complexity. Those decisions include savings and
investment decisions or the selection of insurance contracts. In the light of the evidence presented in this article, this
assumption is clearly implausible.
