Also, (2.15); gives S in terms of the nested brackets of order 1,2, (2.19) can be rearranged to give
{I, - VS} in terms of nested brackets of orders < 3. So if the list of constitutive variables includes a dependence on S and 1, - VS, but on no higher
derivatives of S, then that list of variables can be recast in terms of nested Lie brackets of order
less than or equal to 3. To proceed, in this case, I follow [10] and make an assumption: it is that
the nested brackets of orders less than or equal to 2 provides a basis for the nested brackets of
order 3â€”this amounts to a constraint on the elastic invariants additional to those that derive
from (2.13) (in fact it implies that one of those two constraints is satisfied). The assumption
implies that nested brackets of all orders are determined as linear combinations of {I;}, {La}, so
we have a Lie algebra with basis included in the set {{J;}, {Lq}}â€”Elzanowski and Preston call
this the lattice algebra derived from the lattice vector fields, and note that Palais [9] gives the
existence of a Lie group G (of dimension higher than the number of lattice vectors in the case


VS #0) with corresponding Lie algebra g homomorphic to the lattice algebra. We shall see later
how the lattice vector fields are related to objects in G.
