ing from all others, when equal yolumes are compared, and signalizing itself by the
enormous magnitude of its absorption, we have boracic ether, each molecule of which
embraces no less than 25 atoms. The time now at my disposal enables me to do little
more than glance at these singular facts ; but I must direct the attention of chemists to
the water molecule: its power as a radiant and an absorbent is perfectly unprecedented
and anomalous, if the usually recognized formula be correct.

In Table IIL. a fact is revealed which is worth a little further attention. The mea-
$urements there recorded show that the absorption of a layer of iodide of methyl,
strongly coloured with iodine (which, doubtless, had been liberated by the action of
light), was precisely the same as that of a perfectly transparent layer of the liquid.
The iodine, which produced 80 marked an effect on light, did not sensibly affect the
radiant heat emitted by the platinum spiral. Here are the numbers :â€”

| Absorption.
Todide of Methyl (transparent) . > RI
Todide of Methyl (strongly coloured with iodine). 54

In this case, the incandescent spiral, or a flame, was visible when looked at through
the liquid; I therefore intentionally deepened the colour (a rich brown), by adding
