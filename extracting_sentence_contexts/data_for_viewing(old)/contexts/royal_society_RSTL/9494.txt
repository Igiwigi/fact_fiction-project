common differences both of ordinates and abscissz for the two gases (although the
absolute ordirates differ widely, and the shapes of the curves differ considerably) not
only affords a double verification, but precludes the possibility of accidental coincidence.

It is further to be noticed, both with respect to the foregoing comparison of the
theoretical with the experimental results, and also with respect of such further com-
parisons as will be made, that the reasoning admits of being reversed ; and instead of
deducing the experimental results from the equation, it might have been shown that a
similar equation is the necesxary outcome of the experimental results. Indeed, this
has been already done, and it is only out of regard to the length of this paper that I
refrain from including the inverse reasoning.

Results IV. and V. also follow 80 directly from equation (101) as to require no
comment.
