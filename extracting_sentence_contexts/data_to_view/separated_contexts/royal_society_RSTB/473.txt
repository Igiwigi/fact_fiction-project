The anterior tympanic recess (figs. 4 and 6, a.tymp.r.) is a deep pit floored only by
membrane, and bounded in front by the basi-pterygoid process (B.Ptg. Pr.), the
apparent length of which is much greater than in later stages. This is, of course,
due to the fact that, on the appearance of the basi-temporal, its pretemporal wing
extends laterad forming a floor to the anterior tympanic recess, and continuous in
front with the basi-pterygoid process. There, is a large posterior basi-cranial fontanelle (p.ber,fo.) filled with connective
tissue and appearing as an actual aperture when the latter is removed. The anterior
basi-cranial fontanelle (a.ber.fo.), and the carotid canals passing inwards from the
corresponding foramina (Int.car.) are clearly seen through the rostrum (fost.)
