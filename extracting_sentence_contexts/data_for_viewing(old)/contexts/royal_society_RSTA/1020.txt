thus enhance their mechanical properties.

(a) Design

Fibrin hydrogels were prepared by addition of Ca?+ ions to blood plasma, following the
protocol first reported by Alaminos and co-workers [38]. Briefly, fibrin fibres are formed by
polymerization of fibrinogen molecules, a process that takes place in three steps [28]. (i)
Formation of fibrin monomers by thrombin cleavage of fibrinopeptides [46]. (ii) Formation
of a non-covalent fibrin polymer network by electrostatic and hydrogen bonding between
fibrin monomers. (iii) Covalent cross-linking of the fibrin polymer network, catalysed by
the action of transglutaminase enzyme [46]. It should be noted that fibrinogen molecules
are soluble before step (i) and contain some positively charged domains [46]. Therefore,
they can interact electrostatically with negatively charged particles. In fact, we previously
demonstrated that when magnetite nanoparticles with OH™ functionalization (MagP-OH
nanoparticles from now on) were dispersed in the blood plasma prior to polymerization, these
particles were homogeneously integrated within the resulting fibrin hydrogel, forming clusters
at the knots of the polymer network [28]. These clusters very likely acted as condensation
sites for the subsequent polymerization of the fibrin fibres, following steps (i)-(iii) described
above.

For the preparation of the anisotropic magnetic fibrin hydrogels, we used as a magnetic phase
MagP-OH nanoparticles. These particles consisted of a spherical core of magnetite (90 vol.%)
coated by a layer of polymer with OH™ functionalization. In total, the particles have a mean
hydrodynamic diameter of 110nm, as measured by a Zetasizer instrument. We added adequate
amounts of suspensions of these particles in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer to liquid
