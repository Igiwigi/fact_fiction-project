for a cold winter in order to flower in the following spring
and this requirement is underpinned by the cold-induced

repression of specific alleles of FLOWERING LOCUS C
(FLC), which encodes a major repressor of flowering [148].
The maintenance of FLC silencing past winter relies on tri-
methylation of lysine 27 of histone H3, which is deposited
by polycomb repressive complexes. This prolonged epi-
genetic silencing is ultimately reversed during reproduction
and embryo development [149,150]. Resetting of FLC at
each generation [151] is essential, as it ensures that the
requirement for winter is re-established at each generation.
The fact that such reprogramming likely entails a high meta-
bolic cost and is yet clearly adaptive illustrates the
evolutionary advantage of preventing the transmission
across generations of epivariants induced by seasonal cues.

Although reprogramming of overall DNA methylation is
limited in plants, RdDM-dependent CHH methylation is
actively removed and re-established during sexual reproduc-
tion [98]. Thus it is tempting to draw a parallel with the active
resetting of FLC expression at each generation and to propose
that transgenerational inheritance of DNA methylation var-
iants at TE-containing alleles would in most cases be
disadvantageous. Indeed, a few lines of evidence suggest
