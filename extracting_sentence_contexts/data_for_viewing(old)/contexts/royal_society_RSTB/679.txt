PROPERTIES OF “THE SKIN OF THE COMMON EEL. 355

The quick rise of E.M.F. upon excitation and the slow return to the previous value
are clearly seen in this experiment, and also the dependence of the magnitude of
increase of the E.M.F. upon the strength of the stimulus.

Since Roeser had noticed the occurrence of fatigue phenomena in the case of the
excitatory variation of the skin of the Frog, I deemed it of interest to search for
evidence of the fact in the case of the Eel. Pieces of skin, the E.M.F. of whose
| current of rest was increasing with time, were chosen for experiment, since, if any
evidence of fatigue were forthcoming as a result of repeated excitation, it would
obviously be more convincing in such instances.

a The following experiment is an instance of an attempt to produce a condition of

3 fatigue.
