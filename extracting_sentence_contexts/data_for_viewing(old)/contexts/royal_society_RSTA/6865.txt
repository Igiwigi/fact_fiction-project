Let the variables undergo the non-singular transformation

Let the concomitant be expressed in the form

S = PE, Aa) Beg 2 BM, (3-1)

where a,,), big), -.-» are tensor coefficients and x‘” is a Clebsch variable tensor. The symbol
P(}, is a numerical coefficient which is given an upper suffix equal to every lower suffix in
the tensor coefficients, and a lower suffix equal to every upper suffix in the Clebsch variable
tensor. Summation is assumed to take place between the repeated suffixes.

The suffixes (a), (f), (y), etc., satisfy certain symmetrizing relations, corresponding to
the types of the various ground forms, the type of the Clebsch tensor, and to the fact that the
interchange of coefficients from the same ground form will not alter the expression. Corre-
sponding to any such symmetrizing relation, there will be another symmetrizer which will
annihilate this symmetrizer. Correspondingly, a set of coefficients, P(%,
that PO) ay bp) ...¥#” gives zero. The expression (3-1) for the concomitant / is therefore
not unique.

To obtain uniqueness, however, one need only operate on the coefficients P{), with all
the symmetrizing relations, satisfied by the suffixes (a), (7), (y), etc. If it is assumed that
this operation has been effected, then the coefficients P{9, are uniquely determined by the
concomitant /.

Since / is a concomitant of the ground forms, it is an algebraic form which is either an
