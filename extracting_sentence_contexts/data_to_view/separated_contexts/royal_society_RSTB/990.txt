alike in the phenomena attending “ heat” and menstruation, and in the lower ¥

at any rate, a similar growth is found in the early development of the placen:

function of this growth I consider to represent the preparation of the uterus
reception of an ovum, which the coincidence of “ heat” and ovulation enables the
in these animals to anticipate with some certainty. The histological similar

that these processes are analogous, while the differences which exist are, in my op
referable to the increased complexity attending the process of breeding in the }
animals.

ConcLuston. In the description which has been given of the menstruation of S. entellus, att
has been drawn to the primitive nature of the stroma, of which the mucosa is
composed, The most remarkable changes which take place in the mucosa have
indicated, and some idea given of the part played by the various tissues cone
An endeavour has been made to establish the fact that the monthly history o
adult non-pregnant uterus consists of four periods, namely, A, rest; B, grow
degeneration ; and D, recuperation, The existence of these periods, although
cannot be quite sharply defined, are, nevertheless, very marked and real, and
indicate that a substantial periodic growth of the mucosa is arrested by degeneri
changes when a fertilised ovum is not present. List oF AUTHORS REFERRED TO.
