Finally, I passed the electricity first through an exhausted receiver, 80
as to make it there resemble the aurora horealis, and then through the galva-
nometer to the earth; and it was found till effective in deflecting the needle,
and apparently with the same force as before. 307. From all these experiments, it appears that a current of common elec-
tricity, whether transmitted through water or wire, or rarefied air, or by means
of points in common air, is still able to deflect the needle; the only requisite
being, apparently, to allow time for its action : that it is, in fact, just as mag-
netic in every respect as a voltaic current, and that in this character therefore
no distinction exists. MDCCCXXXIII. F
