This section presents some selected
export of sugar phosphates, particularly of triosephosphates knowledge on transporters which for the time being can be cate-
or hexoses, from the chloroplast. As previously estimated, the gorized in those participating in bulk transport of assimilates like
entirety of the chloroplasts of a mesophyll cell exposes a surface triosephosphates (figure 2). Many of them are well characterized

For this estimation, the shape of a chloroplast was taken as an was among the first transporter proteins cloned from plants
