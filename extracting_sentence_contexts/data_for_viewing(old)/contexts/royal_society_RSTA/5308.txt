with damping (the linear term —A) instead of gain (+A in (3.2)). As shown in [70], when the
injection is of rocking type, as in equation (3.3), the decomposition (3.4), with (3.5) and (3.6), holds
and the slow part is governed by the following damped nonlinear Schrédinger equation with
parametric gain,

dpAs = —[1 + in(@ — 2y)]Ag + inyA® + iV7Ag + inlAs|7As- (6.2)

This equation predicts the existence of phase-bistable homogeneous states and patterns, and these
predictions hold even far from the conditions leading to (6.2), which are fast rocking.

Note that this result concerning the effectiveness of Rocking below a Hopf bifurcation (i.e. for
weakly damped waves) is not at odds with the reasoning in §2 because in the case of the Kerr
cavity, equation (6.1), no mechanical analogue (in terms of a potential) can be drawn. In fact, if we
consider a variational case (deriving from a potential) below the oscillation threshold (4 = —1), it
is easy to check, following the steps in §3, that equation (2.3) for a single oscillator admits solutions
of the form ((3.4) and (3.6)), where the slow part verifies

das
dt

=—(1+2y)As — yA® = |Agl?As, (6.3)

and this equation does not hold but the trivial solution A, = 0, i.e. no phase bistability below the
Hopf bifurcation if the nonlinearity is real. It is the imaginary character of the Kerr nonlinearity
that makes rocking effective below the oscillation threshold.
