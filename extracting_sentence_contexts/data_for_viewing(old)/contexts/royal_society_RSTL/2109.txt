I am the more inclined to bring forward these new labours
at the present moment, though they are far from being in a

finished state, because the discovery of OtrsTeD and that of
Moricnrni, illustrated by some late ingenious enquiries,
connect the electro-chemical changes with entirely new
classes of facts, and induce a hope that many of the compli-
cated phenomena of corpuscular changes, now obscure, will
ultimately be found to depend upon the same causes, and to
be governed by the same laws; and that the simplicity of
our scientific arrangements will increase with every advance
in the true knowledge of nature.

II. Some historical details.

As T am not acquainted with any work in which full and
accurate statements on the origin and progress of electro-
chemical science are to be found, and as some very erroneous
statements have been published abroad, and repeated in this
