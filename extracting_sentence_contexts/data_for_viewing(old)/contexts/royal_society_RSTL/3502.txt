contain water, or, in a word, those which I have called electrolytes (664. 823. 921.),
either exert no contact force at their place of contact with the metals, or if they do
exert such a power, then it is with this most important difference, that the forces are
not sbject to the same law of compensation or neutralization in the complete circuit,
as holds with the metals (1809.). But this, I think I am justified in saying, is an as-

sumption also, for it is supported not by any independent measurement or facts (1808.),
but only by the theory which it is itself intended to support.

1811. Guided by this opinion, and with a view to ascertain what is, in an ac-
tive circle, effected by contact and what by chemical action, I endeavoured to find
some bodies in this latter class (1810.) which should be without chemical action on
the metals employed, s0 as to exclude that cause of a current, and yet snch good con-
ductors of electricity as to show any currents due to the contact of these metals with
each other or with the fluid: concluding that any electrolyte which would conduct
the thermo current of a single pair of bismuth and antimony plates would serve the
required purpose, I sought for such, and fortunately s0on found them.
