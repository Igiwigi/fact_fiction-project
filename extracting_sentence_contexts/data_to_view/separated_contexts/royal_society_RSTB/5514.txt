It passes dorso-laterally so that
its fibres penetrate the medial, the basal and the cortical amygdaloid nuclei. The
writer has been unable to circumscribe definitely its origin. The fact that it appears
as a definite bundle at about the transverse level of the nucleus olfactorius lateralis
with a few fibres anterior, suggests that it may connect the lateral subcortical olfactory
areas with the amygdaloid complex. In all probability fibres from the pyriform lobe
enter it and are distributed caudally to amygdaloid nuclei. Connections between the nuclei of the corpus striatum (nuc.c.str., figs.
