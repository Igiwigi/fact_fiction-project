A yeast-one-hybrid screen identified the NAC transcription
factor ANACO13 as a regulator of mitochondrial retrograde sig-

nalling [41] (figure 1). Direct binding of ANACO17 to the MDM that OM66 expression is regulated in a manner distinct from
present in the ANACO13 promoter suggests that ANACO13 is AOX1a, but follows the pattern of the positive regulator of SA
regulated by ANACO17 [41]. This is consistent with the fact responses PATHOGEN-RELATED PROTEIN 1 (PR1) [11]. The
that ANACO17 was identified by a forward genetic screen show- expression of PR1 was reduced in 066 mutants and a higher

ing that ANACO013 could not compensate for inactivation of SA content was observed in OM66 overexpression lines [11]. Ss
