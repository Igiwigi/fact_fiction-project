Consequently neither the ‘atlas’ nor the second vertebra of Amphibia is strictly
homologous with the atlas of the Amniota.” He referred to these vertebre as “ pro-
atlantic vertebre.” In Mus the evidence points to the fact that at least 5 segments
contribute to the formation of the occipital region of the cranium, so that, accepting
Gapow’s nomenclature, at least five of the most anterior vertebre of Amphibia are
“pro-atlantic vertebra.” The formation of the hypoglossal nerve is intimately connected
with the development of the cervical flexure, and although little that is not extremely
speculative can be advanced regarding the inclusion of the pro-atlantic vertebra into
the occipital region of the cranium, yet it seems that in mammals generally, an ex-
planation of the phylogenetical significance of this flexure would provide the key to
an elucidation of the problem. But the question of the so-called pro-atlas is quite distinct from that of the pro-
atlantic vertebra.
