5 The effects thus stated to have been produced upon pure and upon alloyed silver,
SZ most probably in like manner prevail in respect to go!d ; but this cannot be stated as a
= certain fact ; for, although there is much reason to suppose, that under a small or very
Z moderate pressure, the wear of gold against gold of an equal quality is uniformly in
A an inyerse ratio to the degree of ductility, and allowing that under such circum-

Stances fine gold would suffer a less diminution than gold which is alloyed, yet the
present experiments proye, that under a considerable pressure, the order of wear is
in some measure different ; for, extremely soft or fine gold is then found to suffer as
great, or indeed a greater diminution, than gold which is but moderately ductile :
j and the whole of the experiments which have been made for the purpose of the present
| investigation, concur to show, that gold which is neither extremely soft nor extremely
| hard, is best adapted to resist friction in general.
