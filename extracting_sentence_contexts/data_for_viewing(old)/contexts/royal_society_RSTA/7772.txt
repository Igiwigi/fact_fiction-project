Calling this solution /,, near the edge it reduces to

Fy = jet (ka)t = {cos H(p— Yo) —cos 3(¥ + Ho)}.

The function F, is not, however, the complete solution, for we have still to satisfy
the conditions over the perfectly reflecting edge 6 = 0. We require, in fact, another
solution of equation (36). For this purpose write
F = Reosny,
so that R must satisfy the equation
2 2

Let u = (kp)* R,

)R 0.

then uw must satisfy the equation
