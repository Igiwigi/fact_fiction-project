X-ray source in a CT system, while the lower detectors detect the presence, absence and scattering
of the muons that were defined by the upper detectors. This is, in fact, very similar to a CT
system, but due to the angular distribution of cosmic muons and due to the geometric limits
imposed by the detector system only a narrow angular range around the vertical is covered. This
necessarily means that the resolution of such a muon tomography system in the horizontal plane
(in x and y) will be much better than the vertical resolution (along with the z-axis). The existing
muon tomography systems are static systems, i.e. they require that the object or sample is placed
inside their active volume.
