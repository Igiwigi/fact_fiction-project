the long tail of fibres. It is bounded above by the corona radiata; in front by the
caudate nucleus, and inferiorly by the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle, which
here separates it from its splenium and from the calcarine fibres (fig. 10, Cf). This
prolongation of the corpus callosum backwards into the occipital lobe is what is
known as the tapetum, and its relations will be better understood by referring to the
description of the corpus callosum in the horizontal direction. At present it will
suflice to note that there is no connection between these fibres of the corpus callosum

and those of the internal capsule, as has been stated by Professor Hamrtron (‘ Roy.
Soe. Proc.,’ February, 1884); in fact, the two sets of fibres are at an acute angle to
each other.

We must now consider the relation of the splenium to the posterior part of the
corpus callosum. In fig. 5 (Sp/.) the splenium is of a triangular shape, and is, so to
speak, wedged in between the optic thalamus in front and the fascia dentata behind.
At its anterior and upper angle are the fibres of the fornix, ie., the posterior
descending crus (//.), which forms the tenia hippocampi. Here, therefore, the
splenium is in close proximity to its main body. In the next section (fig. 6), how-
ever, the posterior part of the corpus callosum is seen to be separated from its
splenium by a distinct space. This space is the commencement of the posterior horn
of the lateral ventricle, and is very well seen in fig. 7.
