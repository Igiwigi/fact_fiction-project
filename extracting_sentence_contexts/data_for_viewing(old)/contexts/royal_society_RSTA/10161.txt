same chemical group, Plate 31, suggests that atomic properties play their part in
determining the behaviour of a metal to the flow of heat and electricity through it.

Electronic theories have regarded the free electrons as the sole carriers of energy
from molecule to molecule, and have therefore been unable to deal with the thermal
conductivities of electrical insulators, in which there can be no free electrons. Now
the thermal conductivities of some substances which insulate electrically are as large
as those of the worse conducting metals, e.g., the thermal conductivity of quartz along
the axis is 0Â°029, while that of bismuth is only 0016 to 0019. It seems, therefore,
that a theory of heat conduction which ascribes it to free electrons alone must be a
very partial account of it.

The fact pointed out on p. 427, that the variation of the thermal conductivities of
the metals with temperature is of the same character as, though less marked than, the
corresponding variations for electrical insulators, and that alloys vary in a manner
similar to the only mixture (glass) of insulators yet investigated, both support this
contention, that theories which depend solely on free electrons as carriers can liardly
claim to be adequate expressions of the phenomena.

This investigation was commenced in Manchester, where a liquid air plant was
available. I have to thank Dr. E. C. C. Barty and the authorities of University
College for kindly providing me with liquid air in London.

I have also to thank the Committee administering the Government Grant for
Scientific Investigations for a large proportion of the funds out of which the materials
