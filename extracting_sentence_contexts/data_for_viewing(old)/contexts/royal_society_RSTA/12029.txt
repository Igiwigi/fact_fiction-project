The temperatures are numbered from the origin 0° to 100°. At 100°, as initial tempe-
rature, there could be no condensation, hence all the lines must pass through this
point. As the condensations are set off vertically at the initial temperature, ¢,, of
each series of experiments, the slope of the line joining this point to the point 100°
on the axis of temperature affords the mean specific heat over the range ¢, to 100°.
Hence joining all the points so fixed gives a graphic representation of the behaviour
of the gas at the particular density to which the experiments apply when the lower
limit of temperature is varying. The dotted lines upon the diagram to Part IL.
give these same experiments, for the most part, but plotted as specific heats against
absolute density.

Looking at the lowest couple of lines, p = 0°0456 and p = 0°0800, we see observa-
tions connected by a straight line—laid down in fact through the experiments by aid
of a straight-edge, and it follows from this—the slope of the line being uniform
throughout—that at these densities the variations of specific heat, as the range is
varied from about 10°-100°, 35°-100°, 56°-100°, and 78°-100°, is so small as to have
escaped experimental detection or be non-existent. For although the lower of the two
densities lies at the limit to which observations could be carried with the arrange-
ments used, and are therefore unsteady in some degree, the higher density allowed
of considerable accuracy in the observations, and the uniformity of the line obtained
for it, taken in conjunction with the teaching of the lines referring to higher
densities—which show a curvature increasing with the density—appears to render it
a safe conclusion that at densities below 0°08 the variation of the specific heat with
temperature, over the limits 10° to 100°, is very small. Not probably non-existent,
however, as there is no reason to suppose any discontinuity in the physical properties
