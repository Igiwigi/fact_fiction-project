Water contact is
assumed to decline with age [96,97], but additional factors
such as occupational risk (for example, fishing), sex differences
[98,99] and local variations in snail habitats [100] will contribute
to defining the individual exposure parameter s; in equation
(3.2). Biases in participation in schistosomiasis programmes
may contribute to increased heterogeneities in morbidity risk
after interventions, and studies of social and economic factors
that may determine non-participation in MDA programmes
indicate alternative strategies may be necessary to ensure
access to treatment, and therefore morbidity reduction, is
equitable for at-risk populations [101,102].
