There are several possible methods of solving these equations, the chosen one depending
on the skill and experience of the computer. For example, the nine equations could be

solved simultaneously by the standard relaxation procedure. Alternatively, the fictitious
points could be expressed in terms of w,, Wz, We and wp, leaving four equations for relaxation.

Or again, an iterative process could be used, in which the fictitious points are held fixed at
some approximate values while equations (B.16) are solved for wy, W;, We and wp. New
and more accurate values can then be obtained for the fictitious points from (B.17) and
the process repeated until there is no further change. This last method is effectively the one
used (graphically) by Fox & Southwell, and has the advantage that no complicated formulae
are used in the relaxation; the process may, however, converge only slowly.

The solution of these equations agrees with the analytical solution (B. 14) to four figures,
the precision being dependent on the number of decimals retained in the binomial coeffi-
cients and subsequent work. The differences of this solution of order higher than the fourth
are negligible, so that there is no correction for either differential equation or boundary
conditions. In most problems, of course, these corrections will have to be computed, and
the technique mentioned in §§ 2 and 7, of introducing them as new residuals on the same
