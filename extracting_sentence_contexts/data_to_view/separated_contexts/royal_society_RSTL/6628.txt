S It is a fact observed in agriculture, that manures rich in organic matter frequently
| Eavour the growth of Leguminous crops. We shall not here discuss the question
Swhether these organic manures, as such, act simply as a source of carbonic acid, or of
Scarbon compounds of a more complicated character. We would, however, call attention
Sto the fact that, in the case of the experiments now under consideration, the vital forces
Syere sufficiently energetic to perform the function of cell-development and multiplica-
-Stion, from carbonic acid as its source of carbon; yet these forces, capable of effecting
=this result, have been incapable of effecting the appropriation of free Nitrogen. E

Zplant is not of 80 decisive a character as that with regard to the cereals, or even to the
ZLeguminous plants; for the quantity of dry matter in the produced plants is less than
that in the seed sown, whilst the Nitrogen in the plants is little more than one-third
that of the seed.
