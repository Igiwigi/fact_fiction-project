H. MUMMERY ON THE PROCESS OF

true calcospherites, corresponding to those produced in the experiments, the carbonate
of calcium being combined with a small proportion only of phosphate. That some altered chemical conditions of this nature must occur is, I think,
evidenced by the fact, which I have described above, that large calcospherites com-
parable in every respect to those found in the organic solutions employed in the
experiments are to be seen in young enamel. These large bodies only persist in this
state of aggregation for a short time, and as phosphates are added from the blood
they break down, and the resulting disintegrated particles form the finally consoli-
dated enamel. In dentine also, except where the process of calcification has been arrested at the
interglobular spaces, a similar breaking down of the first formed caleospherites takes
place, the only evidence of their former presence being the lamination of the dentine,
which is also finally obscured by full calcification in the completed tissue.
