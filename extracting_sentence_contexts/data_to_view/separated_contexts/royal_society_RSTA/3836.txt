Depositing the carrier onto the sample surface is a more common technique when ls |
it comes to testing cementitious materials. This is achieved by first coating the photographic film

and sample surface with a thin layer of white epoxy glue that ensures a good image contrast. 3
After curing, the film is slowly peeled off the base. This results in black lines being transferred : o
onto the specimen surface, based on the fact that the peeling stress between the black ink and the is
glue is much higher than the stress between photographic coating and support. Indeed, the fact : Zs
that the sample surface has to be instrumented by depositing a perfect regular pattern represents : B

a drawback of this method from a practical point of view, as the gluing process is a cumbersome
task that can introduce initial imperfections to the deposited grid. In the present case, the specimen surface is recorded during the test with an ultra-high-speed
camera.
