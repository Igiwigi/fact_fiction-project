afosa, those of the muscle layer are also enlarged, and further the vessels in the
%r part of the mucosa begin to enlarge before the more superficial vessels are
TSarly affected, the increase in size gradually extending from below upwards.
& the densest part of the mucosa the vessels are still very small; pieces of capil-
nes from this region are shown in figs. 16, @ and b, but a detailed description of the
eesels will be given later, and I will not say more of them here.

Ben was swollen and thrown into folds; in that figure the swelling is seen to
»Beern the interglandular substance and not to concern the gland itself.
‘Zhe epithelium is very little, if at all, altered from what it was in Stage I.; the
Jands are firmly fixed deep down in a part of the stroma which undergoes no change
i this time, and the growth of the stroma is greatest between the glands; in
sonsequence of these facts the epithelium is held tightly down at the gland mouths
and the swelling occurs where least resistance is offered by the epithelium, namely,

midway between the glands.
The glands themselves remain short, but their lumen is wider than in Stage I.

A uterus at this stage of menstruation is readily distinguished in superficial exami-
nation by its flushed and swollen surface.
