and this is the force, reckoned as a pull, on unit area of the surface whose normal i

Comparing with (122) we see that the type is preserved, except as regards
terms in F due to variation of c and p in space. That is, the stress is represented in
(101) as the translational force, due to E and H, on the fictitious electrification,
magnetification, electric current, and magnetic current produced by imagining E and
H to terminate at the surface across which Py is the stress.

The coefficient 4 which occurs in (161) is understandable by supposing the fictitious
quantities (“ matter” and “current ”) to be distributed uniformly within a very thin
layer, so that the forces E and H which act upon them do not then terminate quite
abruptly, but fall off gradually through the layer from their full values on one side to
zero on the other. The mean values of E and H through the layer, that is, $B and
4H are thus the effective electric and magnetic forces on the layer as a whole, per
unit volume density of matter or current; or 4E and 3H per unit surface density
when the layer is indefinitely reduced in thickness.

Considering the electric field only, the quantities concerned are electrification and
magnetic current. In the magnetic field only they are magnetification and electric
current. Imagine the medium divided into two regions A and B, of which A i
internal, B external, and let N be the unit normal from the surface into the external
