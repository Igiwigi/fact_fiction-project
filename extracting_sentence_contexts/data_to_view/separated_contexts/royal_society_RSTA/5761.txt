Weare grateful to the Royal Society for inviting us to guest-edit this theme issue, and especially
to its Commissioning Editor, Ms Alice Power, for her precious help offered to us so willingly in
all stages of this demanding project. We are also grateful to all contributors of this theme issue—
old and new friends—who agreed to participate in this project and succeeded in writing such
interesting, unique and novel articles covering a huge amount of cosmological ground. The fact
that mathematical cosmology is a time-honoured field but at the same time such a timely and
lively subject is testimony to the papers included in this theme issue and the efforts of all those
devoted individuals who made that possible. Data accessibility. This article does not contain any additional data.
