Thus, in a completely quantum Universe, one is forced to seek sets
of preferred, effectively classical but ultimately quantum, states that can define what exists—
branches of the universal state vector—and that allow observers to keep reliable records. Without
such a preferred basis, relative states are just ‘too relative’, and the relative state approach suffers
from basis ambiguity [9]. Decoherence selects preferred pointer states [9-11], so this issue was in fact resolved some
time ago. The principal consequence of environment-induced decoherence is that, in open
quantum systems—systems interacting with their environments—only certain quantum states
retain stability in spite of the immersion of the system in the environment: superpositions are
unstable, and quickly decay into mixtures of the einselected, stable pointer states [1-4,9-19]. This
is einselection—a nickname for environment-induced superselection.
