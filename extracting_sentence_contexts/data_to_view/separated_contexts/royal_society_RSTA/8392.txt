—assuming the inversion of order, which limits the types of solution concerned, but
not in a manner relevant to our purpose. Thus

or 4=1/m, the only alternative being ¢(#)=0. Thus the only non-zero solutions
occur when 2=1/z. or our study, the significance of the result lies in the fact that
the homogeneous equation has no solution when 2 = — 1/x, which is the value in the
electrical problem. When 4 = 1/z an infinite number of solutions exist, of very diverse types, some of
which may be indicated. For example, a formula of SoNINE is

J, (k) =2f Tula ) in fe 4, k) ie
which is equivalent to

see 1s J (a) K (w, k) dx

so that J, (y) is a solution of the homogeneous equation with 4 = 1/z.
