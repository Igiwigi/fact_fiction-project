Since Einstein gravity arises from space-time
inhomogeneity without reference to a particular charge, it has therefore to be universal linking
to all particles—massive as well as massless. Thus, the dynamics of the universal force is entirely
driven by space-time geometry. In particular, there is no freedom to prescribe the inverse square
law; it is in fact dictated by the geometry of space-time. It is remarkable to note that Newton’s
Law follows from the space-time geometry. This is the fact which is not generally appreciated and


acknowledged upfront like this.
