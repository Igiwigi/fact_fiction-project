Prior to the late 1800s, complex dynamics were associated with a purely
stochastic or random behaviour without a proper mathematical foundation. However, in the
late 1900s, Poincaré’s research on the three-body problem [75] led to the description of chaotic
determinism and chaos theory. These advances led to the concept that complex systems
are in fact dynamical systems that are governed by deterministic equations. As one might
