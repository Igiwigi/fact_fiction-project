theories by a combination of abduction, belief revision and conceptual change which reconcile an
initial theory’s predictions with conflicting observations of the environment, leading to a revised
theory.


The next article, ‘Argument and explanation’ by Hahn & Tesic [7] considers the relationship
between the concepts of argumentation and explanation in the context of philosophy of science
and common-sense reasoning. While the philosopher Carl Hempel saw scientific explanation as
a type of argument, Hahn and Tesic stress that arguments typically play a role in dialogue, in
trying to convince others (and perhaps also oneself) of the truth or rightness of some contested
matter. Here, arguments are in the service of the broader goal of persuasion, and factors beyond
the argument itself (such as who was its source) are crucial. But explanations can often apply
when there is no issue of doubt about the point to be explained: thus, facts ranging from, say, the
blueness of the sky or that a piece of kitchen cheese has been nibbled, may not be in doubt, but still
may stand in need of explanation. A crucial issue here is what makes an explanation satisfying—
what distinguishes chains of reasoning to a particular conclusion that provides a sense of insight
and understanding. Hahn & Tesic provide a review of the state-of-the-art in psychological and
atificial intelligence approaches to both argument and explanation, and point the way for future
research.

Gweon et al. [8] in their paper ‘Beyond imitation: machines that understand and are : =
understood by humans’ focus on a particular, and especially fundamental, aspect of explanation: : =
the human ability to infer and reason about the mental states of others from observing their 1B
behaviour. Such inferences may be crucial when attempting to learn from another person; and : =
equally is crucial from the point of view of the teacher, attempting to infer what the learner ZR
