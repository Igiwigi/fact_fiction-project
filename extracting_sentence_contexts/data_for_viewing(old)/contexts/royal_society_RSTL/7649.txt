infiltration has least obscured the structure. But in the absence of these, there would
have been sufficient evidence to be gained from a close comparison with corresponding
appearances in Parkeria, to demonstrate the general tubularity of the labyrinthic system.
This character is foreshadowed in a group of Foraminifera of much simpler type. I
have elsewhere* described the occurrence in E{lipsoiding (an interesting genus of Fora-
minifera discovered by Professor SEGUENZA in the Miocene clays of Sicily) of a line of
tubular columns, whose only ostensible office is to support a series of chambers which
otherwise would have but little connexion with each other. There is a strong reason
why the accessory skeleton which forms 80 large a proportion of the entire bulk of the
shell in Zoftusic should be built up on a plan that would ensure the greatest strength
with the least weight. The habit of Foraminifera is to live on the surface of the sand
or mud at the bottom of the sea, and recent shells taken from a position entirely beneath
the top of the mud are dead and empty ;—in point of fact the animal dies if it is buried
in the sand. It is clear from the nature of the limestone matrix, that the floor of the
8a in which Zoftusia lived was a very fine calcareous mud, soft and oozy. Now the
specific gravity of the material of which the skeleton is built is about 2:7; and sarcode
itself may be regarded as but little heavier than water; s0 that if, as may be supposed,
the hollow sinuses were occupied by sarcode, it would materially alter the relation between
the specific gravity of the animal and the element in which it lived; that is to say, the
mass comprising the shell and the sarcode would be of much lower specific gravity than |,
would be the case were the skeleton solid :—hence the animal would be correspondingly
better fitted to preserve its natural habitat. It is not certain, however, that the laby-
rinthic sinuses were occupied by sarcode, or even that the ends projecting into the
sarcode-cavities were open ; and it is still possible that they may have fulfilled some
distinct, functional purpose. In the absence of evidence on this point, it is needless to
