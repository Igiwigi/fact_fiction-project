In the other extreme situation—Case S—where the scale of the heterogeneity is small
compared with the scale of the phase boundary (equivalently, wide interface), we find through
homogenization, that the limiting model is very different. The interface averages over a number


of heterogeneities and thus may not be pinned in a significant manner. Thus, the resulting
macroscopic behaviour may not display any stick-slip behaviour and can have extremely small
hysteresis.

In the intermediate case—Case G—where the two length scales are comparable, there is close
interaction between the phase boundary and the heterogeneity resulting in a range of behaviours.
We show through numerical simulation that the amount of hysteresis can vary widely, and
relation between the relative heterogeneity size and the critical depinning stress can in fact be
non-monotone.

An insight that comes from this analysis is that a potential route to making materials with
low hysteresis is to introduce heterogeneities at a length scale that is small compared with the
width of the phase boundary. This is seemingly counterintuitive because pinning and increased
hysteresis is well documented in the widely studied sharp interface (large heterogeneity) case.
Our result shows that this is not universal and engineering the appropriate combination of length =
scales provides an important opportunity. :

While a direct comparison with experimental observations is beyond the scope of this idealized
model, the results are consistent with various experimental observations. The role of pinning nee)
in the large heterogeneity case is well documented [10]. Recently, Lisfi ef al. [20] observed
