magmas voluminously erupted along convergent plate boundaries [4] provided notional support
for the role of plate tectonics in building, or at least shaping, the continental crust [5,6]. Numerous
studies have since linked plate tectonics to the processes and rates of continental stabilization
or assembly through time [7-10]. Other studies relate the operation of plate tectonics to the
development of a habitable planet, through formation of buoyant, emergent continents, flux of
essential nutrients into seawater and regulation of the composition of Earth’s atmosphere and
oceans [11-13].

There is, therefore, great interest in determining how far back in time plate tectonic processes

operated on Earth—or at least when plate tectonics became the dominant mode of planetary : =
dynamics, as it is at the present day. The formidable challenge here is that the accessible record : a
of the critical early part of Earth evolution is incredibly sparse. It could in fact be argued that 3
we know more about the early history of the Moon from the few Apollo sample return missions, : XS
than we do about the early history of the Earth. The conventional explanation for this is that : _
the Earth is a dynamic planet where plate tectonics is operative, generating new crust and 4
resurfacing the planet, erasing or at least smudging, the earlier record. In this view, the very :s
process we are attempting to study has effectively camouflaged the geological imprint of its past : S
operation, as well as that of any geodynamic predecessors—in contrast to the early planetary [Ss

history vividly preserved on the surface of Earth’s neighbours Venus and Mars (e.g. [14])—
although it is important to note that plate tectonics may not be the only mechanism to destroy
crust, especially in a hotter early Earth (e.g. [15]). In a bid to mitigate this limitation, scientists
have increasingly resorted to indirect evidence, or chemical proxies of past processes that can
‘see through’ plate tectonic reworking, although some of the geochemical signals used for this
