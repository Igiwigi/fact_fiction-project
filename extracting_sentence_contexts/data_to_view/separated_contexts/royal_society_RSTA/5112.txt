It was, in fact, first laid down by PLtcker and Hrrrorr that “ There
is a certain number of elementary substances, which, when differently heated, furnish
two kinds of spectra of quite a different character, not having any line or any band
im common” (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ vol. 155, p. 6). The discovery of this fact was of great importance, for it led to the conclusion that
as one spectrum of an element is replaced by another and totally different spectrum
of the same element, there must be an analogous change in the constitution of the
ether, indicating a new arrangement of the gaseous molecules, and this implies either
a chemical decomposition, or an allotropic condition of the vapour of the substance. Piiicker and Hirrorr concluded that the same matter, in two allotropic states,
emitted different spectra, but the allotropy was dependent solely on temperature. Band spectra they designated spectra of the 1st Order, and Line spectra, spectra of
the 2nd Order.
