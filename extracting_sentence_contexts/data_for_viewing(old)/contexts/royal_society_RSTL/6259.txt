THE LINES OF THE SOLAR SPECTRUM. 153

un sinks, there is no real contraction of its several parts, the distance between the fixed
lines measuring precisely the same at different hours.

The red swn is often attended with a blue sky; the diffused light, in fact, always
exhibits portions of the spectrum which are wanting in the direct rays. 'This may give
rise to a 8ingular phenomenon. There is a green glass coloured by means of copper and
iron which has the power of absorbing the whole of the red and orange rays, but allow-
ing others to penetrate. If the landscape be viewed through this, all the ordinary
objects are seen with tolerable distinctness, though of a greenish or bluish colour, but
anything purely red is extinguished ; and it has happened to Dr. GLapsroNE, on
examining the western sky near sunset with such a glass, that he has seen the various
configurations of the clouds and of the horizon perfectly, whilst the sun itself was 80
little visible that its presence would not have been detected, unless it had been specially
8ought for. No black space is produced in this experiment ; for of course that portion
of the sky immediately between the solar disk and the spectator is sending diffused light
like the parts adjacent.
