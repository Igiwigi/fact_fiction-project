the absolute maximum is found in the after body. In cases 8uch as the
* Minotaur's,' where there is only one section of water-borne division, that is, of course
â€” the section of maximum bending. Attention has previously been drawn to the fact that
- in such caxes the sections of maximum bending (such as @ ' in Plate XVII. fig. 8) usually
lie very near the middle of the length; and many writers on the subject, considering
the distribution of weight and buoyancy too exclusively, refer to the midship section
X as being most severely strained. For still water, however, I have shown above that this
a is by no means true in many ships; and it is only proper to add that some authors of
standing have recently put forward views on this point which are not borne out by my
= calculations.
