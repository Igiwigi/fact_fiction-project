Syhich, 80 far as we know, now exist. The Guinea-fowl and the Loye-bird have in all

Solitaire, The remains of one of the first, and the description of the last, leave little
Tins to doubt but they also were closely allied to the forms found in the other
SMascarene Islands and Madagascar, and thus it is clear that certainly four out of the five
or 8 indigenous species had their natural affines in other species belonging to the
