The inner surface of the right lateral portion of the ethmoid is marked by obliquely
diverging ridges of bone, with which the plates of the inferior spongy bone were doubt-
less connected. b

By combining the new specimen with this it is easy to ascertain approximatively the
length of the cribriform plate. The former specimen, in fact, is broken through at a
distance of six inches from the anterior end of the snout, but its posterior face does not
exhibit any notable part of the anterior wall of the cranial cavity. ' The same distance
(6 inches), therefore, measured off upon the roof of the type skull, should give the
position of a line beyond which the cribriform plate certainly did not extend anteriorly.
