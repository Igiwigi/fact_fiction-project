51, the almost exact correspondence, allowing for the necessary errors of measure-
ment, of the depth of the conjoined 4th and 5th layers is well shown, as is also the
extreme atrophy of the line of GeNNaRi in the blind cases, and the considerable
decrease of thickness of layer 3a. In Case 6, owing to the almost complete
invisibility of the latter layer, layers 3a and 3b were measured together. On
examination of layers 1 and 2 another important fact appears, viz, that there
is an almost exact correspondence between the thickness of the conjoined Ist and
2nd layers of the cortex, and the degree of amentia or dementia existing in the
patient. Case 1 is normal, Case 4 which showed a relatively slight degree of
dementia approaches most nearly to the normal. Cases 5 and 6 of infants aged
respectively three months and one month come next in order, and Cases 3 and 4
of pronounced chronic insanity with dementia, occupy the last place on the list.
