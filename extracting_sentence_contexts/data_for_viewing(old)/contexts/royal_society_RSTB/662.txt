discs, each with an area of about 1°64 square millims., while a corresponding piece
of the Torpedo’s organ would contain about 1680, each having an area of about
9 square millims.

Further experiments may show that the individual electric plates of the Skate are,
when allowance is made for their size, at least as powerful as the corresponding
structures in the Torpedo.

In all the other British Skate, with the exception of R. fullonica, R. circularis,
and R. radiata, the electric organ resembles that of 2. batis. In each case the electric
elements are in the form of dises, but only in two of them, R. alba and R. macro-
rhynchus, is there any evidence that the organ reaches a large size. The organ is, in
fact, so smal] in most of the members of the Skate genus that it is difficult to imagine
what useful purpose it can serve ; but as to its utility some light may be thrown when
we understand the use (granting there is any) of the large organ of full-grown
specimens of F. batis, say of specimens 7 feet in length, with an electrical apparatus
weighing about 300 grms.

The more important stages through which the relatively large and complex electrical
elements of £. batis have passed during their evolution seem to have been, as it were,
stereotyped in the three British species of Skate in which the electric organ consists
of electric cups, 7.¢., in R. radiata, R. circularis, and R. fullonica.

The small and apparently primitive species, 2. radiata, possesses the most primitive
form of electrical organ that can well be imagined ; instead of complex discs or greatly
