air of the atmosphere acting as a chemical agent and an imperfect conductor. The same fact is proved by the electric column of DzLuc. The plate of zinc
becomes partially oxidized by the oxygen of the atmosphere, electricity is ge-
nerated or set- at liberty, and the film of moist air in contact with the two
metals acts as the fluid conductor in an ordinary yoltaic arrangement. If the
compound plate be coated with electric cement to exclude the chemical action
of the air on the zinc, I will venture to predict that no decided electric effect
will take place.
