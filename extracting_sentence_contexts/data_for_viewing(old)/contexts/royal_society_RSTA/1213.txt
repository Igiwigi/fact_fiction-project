giant interpretation, with extreme internal O/H enrichments of greater than 250, but on closer
inspection the evidence for CO at pressures above a few bar is not convincing. Such a model
would also most likely require incomplete interior mixing during formation to explain Neptune’s
low atmospheric D/H ratio.

Cometary CO and reduced upper tropospheric mixing provides an alternative explanation
for Neptune’s CO profile, and is consistent with arguments based on the observed lapse rate
and photochemical model comparisons. This could favour a rock giant interpretation, formed
from rock-ice mixtures with similar properties to present-day solar system objects, resulting in
O/H enrichments similar to C/H. This has the advantage of reconciling Neptune’s CO and D/H
measurements and using known ice sources.

A similar case can also be made for Uranus being a rock giant. The case for Uranus is in fact
more straightforward, as there is no observed tropospheric CO requiring an explanation, either
in terms of highly enriched O/H or external cometary source.

Definitively distinguishing between ice and rock giant scenarios on Uranus and Neptune
will require a dedicated future mission with orbiter and entry probe elements [28,29,106]. A
key measurement to make with such a probe would be the CO profile down to at least 10 bar
from a mass spectrometer. However, both CO and Nz have a molecular mass of 28, making
this a difficult observation. Nz is also predicted to be an important disequilibrium quenched
constituent being dredged up from the deep atmosphere, so any instrumentation on an in situ
Neptune/Uranus probe would need some way of distinguishing CO from N2 [26,30], which was
not possible with the mass spectrometer included on the Galileo probe to Jupiter [107]. If such a
