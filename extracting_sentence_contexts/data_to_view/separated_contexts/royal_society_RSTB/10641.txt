The TA cells can divide both symmetrically
(to generate more basal TA cells) and asymmetrically, where
one of the daughter cells proceeds through the differentiation
and tissue renewal process. Infection of a TA basal cell could
result in a short-lived infection. In fact, modelling the stochas-
tic dynamics of basal cells predicts that over 80% of infections
could spontaneously clear as infected cells mature [72]. Long-term, persistent infection most probably requires
infection of a slow-cycling stem cell. Moreover, infection of
these slow-cycling cells could promote latency [73].

infection

The importance of the immune system in controlling HPV
infection is very evident in individuals with specific immuno-
deficiencies [74].
