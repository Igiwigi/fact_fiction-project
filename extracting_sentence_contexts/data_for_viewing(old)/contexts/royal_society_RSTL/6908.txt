value. In the above example we may write
u=0gf7..+0,92+0 SHEET,
the last term of which becomes a yanishing fraction when m=—1. The true limiting
form is seen to be
v=OCy7*.. +091 +0.(17 log. +15" logy,). (8)
This is the complete integral of (I.) when m=—1.

is an integral, but not, the general integral of the differential equation (T), it must be
the general integral of a differential equation involved in (T), but of a lower order, We
may in fact conclude that such reduced differential equation will be deducible from the
higher one by a process of integration. Let us apply this consideration to the foregoing
example.

When m=—1, the equation (I) becomes

D(D—1). .(D=n+1)6+3[ D—3—1]" (D=n+Y)%u=0.
Hence operating on both members with (D=n+1)”', we have
—_ 1 n-1 |
D(D—1)..(D=n+2)6+3["= D—3=1] e%u=Co=?.

It must then be possible to determine C s0 as to cause this differential equation to be
satisfied by (9). First let us eek to determine C 80 as to cause the equation to admit
