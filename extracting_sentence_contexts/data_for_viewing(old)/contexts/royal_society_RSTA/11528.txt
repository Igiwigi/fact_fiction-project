well to vary the plan of reading by first reducing the light till it disappears, and then
to note the exact point when it reappears. The latter would be the best plan to use
entirely, since the eye is in darkness till the very last part of the observation, were it
not for the fact that, in noting the reappearance of the light, we are noting something
less defined than when we are noting its disappearance. The combination of the two
methods has been found to be the most satisfactory plan. A very great difficulty
also often arises in keeping the axis of the eye employed in a line with the object
observed, particularly when it is of very small angular aperture. It has been found
advantageous to have a feeble light which can be flashed momentarily on the aperture
to guide the eye just previous to the disappearance of the light. This is more
particularly the case when it is desired to extinguish with the centre of the retina,
as is the case in these observations. The intrinsic light in the eye is also sometimes
difficult to deal with, but by judiciously recognizing the fact that it exists, and by
giving proper intervals between each observation, one is enabled to surmount this
difficulty. Again, a healthy state of mind and body is most essential when making
observations, as the sensitiveness of the eye largely depends on it.

7. Law Connecting the Angular Aperture with the Extinction.

The next investigation carried out, was to ascertain if any law connected the
angular aperture of the object observed with the diminution of the intensity of the
light which was required to cause invisibility, For the purpose, a large number of
diaphragms of very differing apertures were inserted in front of the ground glass
(fig. 3). For the sake of plotting, in the first instance, and as they give the most
rational scale, the diameters of the dises were expressed in powers of 2, thus 4 inch,
