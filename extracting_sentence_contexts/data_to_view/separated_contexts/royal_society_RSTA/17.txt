§ I. Graduation of the Sectors. As the intensity of the comparison-light can only be altered by opening or closing
the sectors of the rotating discs, it is essential that their graduation shall be good. As
a matter of fact, the circles were carefully divided, but the graduation was only regarded
as sufficiently accurate when the aperture used was more than 5°, since for very small
angles the ratio of any small error in graduation to the aperture used might then
not be negligible, which it would be where the aperture was fairly large. As it almost
always happened that coloured light had to be measured, which was very much
dimmer than the comparison-light diminished by an aperture of 5° in the discs, it
became necessary to adopt some other means. To accomplish this, one of the two
following methods was employed:
