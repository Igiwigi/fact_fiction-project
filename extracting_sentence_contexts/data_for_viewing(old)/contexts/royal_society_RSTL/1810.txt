of time during which the animal can support a suspended respiration ; a con-
clusion of the highest degree of importance in the present inquiry.

Birds die almost instantly on being submerged in water ; the mammalia
survive about three minutes, the reptiles and the batrachia a much greater
length of time.

The unborn fetus, the young animal born with the foramen: oyale open, the
reptile, the mollusca, having all a state of the heart approaching to the veno-
contractile, bear a long-continued snspension of the respiration, compared with
the mature animal of the higher classes.

But the most remarkable fact deducible from this reasoning is the follow-
ing: ifsuch a case existed as that of the left side of the heart being nearly or
absolutely yeno-contractile, such an animal would bear the indefinite suspen-

sion of respiration such an animal would not drown though immersed in
water. Now there is precisely such a case. It is that of the hybernating
animal. Tt will be shown in the subsequent paper, that in the state of
perfect hybernation the respiration is nearly suspended ; the blood mnust,
therefore, be venous. Yet the heart continues to contract, although with
a reptile slowness. The left ventricle is, therefore, veno-contractile, and in
