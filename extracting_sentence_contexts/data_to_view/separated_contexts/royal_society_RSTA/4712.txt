Here, the alkene + HO and thermal decomposition of products become competitive, which
would explain the increase of [C3HÂ¢], [C2H4] and [CH,]. It was demonstrated in the numerical
studies of Filimonova [35] that the unfavourable effects of the NTC chemistry could be minimized
depending on the amount of deposited energy injected by the plasma. In fact, a similar conclusion


can be experimentally derived based on these studies. Referring to figure 6, for T > 750K, the
consumption of fuels actually continues in the presence of the plasma, unlike the thermal system,
where fuel consumption begins to decrease for the same temperature region. By 800K, the chain
branching induced by the plasma through O-atom attack is probably dominating the system
and enhancement of fuel consumption resumes.
