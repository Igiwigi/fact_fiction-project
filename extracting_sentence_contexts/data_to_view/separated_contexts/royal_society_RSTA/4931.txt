Joule’s experiments in the 1840s =

James Joule had no doubt that the caloric theory was fundamentally flawed. He arrived at this : ”
conclusion with growing conviction through a long series of experimental investigations starting ae
in the late 1830s and extending through the 1840s. In fact, Joule’s suspicions concerning the :
relation between heat and work may stem from an even earlier period. In 1813, the engineer Peter ne]
Ewart published a paper in the Manchester Memoirs [8] urging his readers to accept the principle DNS
of the conservation of vis viva. The term vis viva literally means living force and was defined as a
mass multiplied by velocity squared, i.e. twice the kinetic energy.
