It was noticed that
the animal felt on both sides, On the right side (non-paralyzed) it responded to the test, and localized
the spot excited, putting the hand of the same side down and scratching the place. On the paralyzed
(left) side the animal remained unconscious of the stimulation longer, but when it did respond, seemed
to be more agitated. This may be explained by the fact that the longer duration of the stimulus
produced greater effect. When the toes of the right foot were dipped into hot water they were quickly withdrawn; when the
toes of the left side were dipped into the same a struggle occurred, but on both sides the response of the
stimulus was delayed, ‘ested by pricking, the animal responded on both sides; the place excited was
localized on the non-paralyzed side by the animal scratching the part with its hand. Temperature, left
popliteal space, 96-2; right, 98; left plantar surface, 94; right ditto, 87°5.
