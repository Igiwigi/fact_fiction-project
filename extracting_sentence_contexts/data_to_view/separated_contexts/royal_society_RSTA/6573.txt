However, it is to be emphasized that the results of these calculations

are subject to large errors, for several reasons previously specified. On this point the results
of this paper do not agree with the deductions of Tsien et al., since they indicate that in all
cases the estimated mass is consistent with a single mass number of 4. If the results of all the experiments are considered, the following facts concerning the
emission of light nuclei in the fission of U2" by slow neutrons may be regarded as established:

(i) A light nueleus is emitted in approximately 1 % of fission events, and in one-quarter
of these cases the range exceeds that of the fission fragments. :

(ii) The range of the light nucleus takes all values up to a limit exceeding 55cm. air
equivalent.

(iii) The specific ionization of the particle is similar to that of the Â«-particle.

(iv) The average mass number is very nearly 4.

(v) The interval of time elapsing between the fission process and the emission of light
nucleus is frequently less than 2 x 107'sec. PARTICLES IN THE SLOW NEUTRON FISSION OF URANIUM _ 341

(vi) The angular distribution of emission directions has a maximum in a direction nearly
perpendicular to that of the initial motion of the fission fragments. In cases where long-
range particles are emitted, the most probable direction of emission makes an acute angle
with the direction of projection of the lighter fission fragment.
