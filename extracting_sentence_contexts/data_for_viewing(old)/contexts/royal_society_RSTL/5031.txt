his delineations and mine there are wide differences.

In Caprella linearis (Lamodipodes, Cuv.), it is an easy process to observe the blood-
cells circulating in the branchial appendages depending from the inferior surface of
the body. They occur under three discernible varieties :â€”1st, simple, non-granular,
non-nucleated, pellucid, spherical globules (fig. 56); 2nd, more or less orbicular
bodies, of which the bright nuclens is prominent visible, and a mass of slightly
refractive molecules; 3rd, the fact, characteristic of all blood-cells falling under the
denomination of the articulate type, of the apparent suppression of the cell-capsule.
In this species the blood-corpuscles are large relatively to the proportions of the
body. On bursting in the field their contents fibrillate in a very obvious manner.
In every observation I have been attentive to note this interesting fact ; it may avail
some future theorist.

The blood of the Amphipode is distinguished for the prevailing orbicular character
of its floating cells. The elliptical figure seldom occurs. 'The nucleus is more cen-
trally situated, and therefore less yisible than is common among the Crustacea. The
