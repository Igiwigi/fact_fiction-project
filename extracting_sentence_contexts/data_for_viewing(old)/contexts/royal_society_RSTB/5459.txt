a matter of relative age. On the other hand, the characters which Sorex and Talpa
have in common and which Erinaceus lacks (such as the processus opercularis, and the
absence of an ala hypochiasmatica) are qualitative differences, which may be held
to express relationship. These considerations lead to the conclusion already expressed
by Parker (1885, p. 198) that hedgehog, mole, and shrew, “ may easily have arisen
from one common stock, and the mole comes in as a connecting link between the well-
developed hedgehog and the scant and stinted form of the shrew.”

Finally, attention may be drawn to a feature which indicates the primitive nature
of the chondrocranium of Sorex, viz., the intercommunication of the posterior and
lateral semicircular canals by means of a perforation in the septum semicirculare
posterius. The perforation is due to the fact that the septum is incomplete, and it is
interesting to note that in phylogeny this septum (semicirculare posterius) is the last
to be formed. Gaupp (1900, p. 517) draws attention to the fact that this septum is
incomplete in Lacerta, in Chelonia and in birds, while in Triton the septum is wholly :
wanting. As far as I know, Sorex is the only mammal in which this feature has as
yet been observed.

V. Summary.
In the chondrocranium and early osteocranium of Sorex, the following points can be
made out :—

1. The posterior paraseptal cartilages are still almost independent of the lamina
transversalis posterior.
