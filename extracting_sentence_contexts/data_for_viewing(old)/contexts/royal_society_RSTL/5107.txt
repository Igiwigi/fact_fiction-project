I hall resume the consideration of the phenomena of binocular vision with this
subject, because the facts I have ascertained regarding it are necessary to be under-
stood before entering on the new experiments relating to stereoscopic appearances
which I intend to bring forward on the present occasion.

Under the ordinary conditions of vision, when an object is placed at a certain
distance before the eyes, several concurring circumstances remain constant, and they
always vary in the same order when the distance of the object is changed. Thus, as
we approach the object, or as it is brought nearer to us, the magnitude of the picture
on the retina increases ; the inclination of the optic axes, required to cause the pic-
tures to fall on corresponding places of the retinz, becomes greater; the divergence
of the rays of light proceeding from each point of the object, and which determines
the adaptation of the eyes to distinct vision of that point, increases ; and the dissimi-
larity of the two pictures projected on the retina? also becomes greater. It is im-
