'= response. Moreover it is of importance for us to note that if the stimuli be adminis-
i= tered by means of needle-point electrodes, it may almost always be observed that an
= area of low excitability does not graduate into an adjacent area of high excitability by
Â© Sunecexsive stages, but that the one area is separated from the other by an exceedingly
S well-defined line of demarcation. :
2 (5) Having observed these lines of demarcation between areas of different degrees of
excitability to be 80 well defined, I was led to *try cutting a spiral strip until the

= In all cases I found that if I stimulated a fraction of a millim. on the spiral strip
& <ide of this line, the spiral strip responded, while the uncut portion of the bell

5 the uncut portion of the bell responded, while the spiral strip remained passive, To
make the fact in question quite clear T may refer to'fig. 9, which represents a portion

of a broad strip wherein the contractile waves became blocked at the curved line

ab. On $timulating the tissue at any point as close as possible on one side of this line,

as at c, a contractile waye would start from that point, and course all the way along the

strip in the direction cd, but in that direction only ; while if the stimulus were applied

at any point on the other side of the line a6, as at e, the contractile wave thus originated
