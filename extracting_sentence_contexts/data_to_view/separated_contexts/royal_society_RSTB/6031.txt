Near the end of the notch of the cricoid a rod of cartilage, of the same type as that
composing the pulvinar, runs into the vocal chord. It is continuous with the cricoid
and also, for a short distance, with the pulvinar. It appears to correspond to the

and the fact of its union with the pulvinar vocale is a step towards the fulfilment of
his prediction that an Anuran would yet be found in which the lip of the vocal chord
