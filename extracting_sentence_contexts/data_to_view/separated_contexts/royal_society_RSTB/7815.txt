We can move from the

gence of the replicator dynamics; all trajectories must | dynamics (Hadeler 1981; Hofbauer 1985). For a

1998; Huttegger 2007a,b). In the case of a 2X2 X 2 Lewis signalling game, with dx;
states equiprobable, the ‘hasty conclusion’ from d
evolutionary stability equilibrium analysis is, in fact,
born out by the dynamics. Equilibria other than the dy;
signalling systems are all dynamically unstable. In both dt
two- and one-population models, replicator dynamics
carries almost all possible population proportions to a where e is the mutation rate and n is the number of
signalling system (Huttegger 2007a,b,c; Hofbauer & strategies.
