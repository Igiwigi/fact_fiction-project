for !=1,...,n —1, where I\(#) = gradyrj|x=,(g) is the gradient vector of r; evaluated at x(¢) on
C characterizing the sensitivity of r; to external stimuli. It is important to note that I)(¢) depends
only on the phase and not on the amplitudes, because it is evaluated on the limit cycle C. Note
the similarity of equation (A 3) and the function I)(¢) for the amplitude to equation (3.3) and the
sensitivity function Z(¢) for the phase. In §3, it was shown that the sensitivity function Z(¢) of
the phase is equal to the transpose of the left eigenvector uj(¢) of A(@) associated with the zero
eigenvalue. Similarly, I}(¢) can be chosen as the /th left eigenvector of A(@) as Ii(¢) =uf(¢)" as
shown below.

Let us now derive the above facts, namely, the decay rate 4 of r in equation (A 1) is equal
to one of the Floquet exponents A1,_,-1 and Ii(¢) =ur(¢)t ([=1,...,n—1). Suppose that an
initial oscillator state at f= 0 is chosen as X(0) = x(0) + €p(0) with @ =0, where (0) = uj(0) G =
0,...,n — 1) and € is an arbitrary tiny parameter; namely, we add a tiny amplitude disturbance
to the oscillator state in the direction of jth eigenvector of A(0) with eigenvalue 4). Evolving
the oscillator without perturbation from this initial state under the linear approximation, the
oscillator state at t= ¢/w can be expressed as X(t) = x(#) + eo($) = x(¢) + 5) e(@/) AM 4 ,(0) =
x(b) + €S() e/a (0) as in §3. Expanding r(X) in Taylor series as r(x (¢) + €o(¢)) = 1(x(@)) +
gradyr|x—y(g) - €p(¢) + O(c?) = €I(¢) - p(@) + O(e*), where I() = gradyr|x—,(g) is the gradient
of r on C, the amplitude r of X(t) can be expressed as r(X(t)) = €I() - p() + O(c?) = eI) -
5(g) e%/#/u5(0) + O(e?). On the other hand, the amplitude r should obey equation (A 1)
by assumption and thus r(X(f)) =e“'r(X(0)) = e“1(0) - uj(0). Therefore, I() - S(4) ev / (0) =
et (o/ )1(0) : u(0) should hold for any ¢ within the linear approximation. This requires the
