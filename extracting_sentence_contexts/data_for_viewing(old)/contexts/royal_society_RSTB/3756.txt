determination of the velocity of transmission of excitation, we require time measure-
ments of the order of one-hundredth of a second. It will be shown that these
measurements can be carried out with great precision, by means of the intermittent
dots themselves, when the periodicity of their recurrence is rendered perfectly
constant. For such purposes, then, we require a frequency of intermittent contacts
amounting to something like one hundred times per second,

The advantage of this intermittence may be understood from a concrete example.
It is to be remembered that the writing-point, under the action of the responsive
fall, moves parallel to the surface of the recording plate. If now, by means of some
mechanism, the writing-point be made to vibrate to and fro, say ten times in a
second, at right angles to the plate, this will in no way affect the record, beyond
the fact that, instead of a continuous, a dotted line will be traced. The record will
not now labour under the defects inseparable from the friction of continuous contact.
Instead of this we shall have the vibrating writer, tapping a record, which is
practically free from friction. For it will be understood that, as in our concrete
example, a recording-point which is vibrating ten times in a second will execute

one entire to-and-fro movement in one-tenth of a second. The duration of contact,
at the extreme forward end of the swing, will represent only a small fraction, say
one-fifth, of the entire period of one vibration. Hence, after each contact, lasting
only one-fiftieth of a second, the recording-point is absolutely free to take up the
