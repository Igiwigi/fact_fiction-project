6. Concluding remarks

Both direct and indirect evidence points unequivocally to the fact that many
trace gases are now present in the atmosphere in concentrations unprecedented
during the last 650 000 years. Many of these gases (e.g. methane) are radiatively
active and play an important direct role in the Earthâ€™s climate system, while
others (e.g. isoprene) have indirect effects on climate through their role in
mediating the oxidant budget of the atmosphere, and because they can oxidize to
form radiatively active particles. In addition, it is now clear that the
biogeochemistry of some of these gases are affected by climate (in the simplest
example, biogenic VOC and anaerobic methane emission rates are both directly
influenced by temperature) leading to the possibilities of strong positive
feedbacks between the biogeochemical cycles of trace gases and climate.
