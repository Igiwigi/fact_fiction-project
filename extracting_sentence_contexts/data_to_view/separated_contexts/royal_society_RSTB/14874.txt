capacity (z=~-3.31, p=0.001), increased monocyte (z=
—2.86, p=0.004), lymphocyte (not significant: z= —1.86,
p=0.06) and eosinophil (not significant: z = —0.90, p = 0.37)
prevalence and MLR value (f=~—2.25, p=0.03), and
decreased neutrophil (z= 2.10, p=0.04) and basophil (not
significant: z=1.87, p=0.06) prevalence and NLR value
(z= 2.63, p=0.02) (figures 1 and 2).

(b) Hormonal parameters

(i) Reproductive phenotype in hormonal parameters
Damaraland mole-rat BFs possessed significantly higher
levels of progesterone (t= —5.54, p = 0.00001) than their NBF
counterparts (figure 3). By contrast, there were no differences
in testosterone (f=—1.97, p=0.06) or cortisol (t= 0.44, p=
0.67) concentrations between Damaraland mole-rat BFs and
NBFs.

(ii) Effect on innate immune strength proxies

All three steroid hormones (testosterone, progesterone and
cortisol) were observed not to affect the prevalence of neutro-
phils, lymphocytes and basophils and the BKA and NLR
(electronic supplementary material, table 54) in female
Damaraland mole-rats. Similarly, the testosterone and cortisol
profiles of female Damaraland mole-rats did not affect the
prevalence of monocytes and eosinophils and NLR, but in
contrast, progesterone profiles did, in fact, affect the preva-
lence of monocytes and eosinophils and MLR (electronic
supplementary material, table S4). In female Damaraland
mole-rats with high progesterone levels, the prevalence of
monocytes and MLR was high, while the eosinophil
prevalence was low (figure 3).

4. Discussion

This study aimed to answer two fundamental, but crucial
questions: (i) Is there a trade-off between reproduction and
