The approach : S
generated a rich crop of proposals for the description of various physical circumstances in which :&
microstructural events have gross-scale effects (porous bodies, liquids with bubbles, ferroelectrics, ma

magnetostrictive materials, etc.). It was thus evident that a view considering the construction
of a mechanical model to be reduced only to a selection of special constitutive relations is at
least restrictive. The construction of a mechanical model starts, in fact, from the way we decide
to describe the morphology of a body and its changes, which influences the representation of
actions, and thus affects the choice of constitutive structures. A foundational problem concerning
the wide taxonomy of specific models was thus to find whether they could be considered as
offspring of a common ground. A proposal in this sense by Germain dates back to 1973 [49]: he
considered descriptors of the material morphology in a linear space and the principle of virtual
work as a guiding rule.
