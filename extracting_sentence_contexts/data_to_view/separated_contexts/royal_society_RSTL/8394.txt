But this important circumstance is also to be borne in mind : on February 7 the syren
happened to be pointed not towards the © Argus,” but towards Dover. Had the yacht
been in the axis of the syren, it is highly probable that the sound might have been heard
all the way across to the coast of France. The fact that Mr. TroucuToN was able through the fog to © locate” the Foreland, and
that his fixing of the direction should be subsequently found correct, is also one of
great importance. Early in the morning of the 20th of February there was also a fog in the neighbour-
hood of the Scuth Foreland.
