series of Cs (satellites for D, (3.4.5.6) observed), we get two values for the N/D° of
the top lines of the formule determining them which give a separation of 97-07, and,
as we shall see, determine the limits of an additional doublet series. The satellite
series are more fully and more numerously developed in other elements than the
alkalies, and their general discussion is better deferred until the other elements are
discussed in a succeeding communication.

In determining the value of « the question arises whether » should be taken to be
a fraction or 1+f. If » =f, m = 1 gives a line too far in the ultra red to have been
observed. The observations of known lines by themselves are not sufficiently exact
to decide the question—as, e.g., in the P series. If we regard the doublet separation
of an associated series as determined by the top lines of its principal series, then, as
we shall see shortly, the evidence in the case of Cs points to the fact that the
denominator of the top line = 2+f, ie. 4 = 1+f; but there may be some uncertainty
here also in view of RypBere’s suggestion that each V of a series may form the limit

of a new series—e.g., not only is there the sharp series VP(1)—VS, but there may
also be VP(2)—VS. Rrrz has given several examples of this. As the matter is
thus open the formula as determined on each supposition is entered in Table IT.

In the P and 8 series « is negative. It is positive in the D series, not only in the
alkalies, but in other typical D series; in fact, so general is the rule, that if any
