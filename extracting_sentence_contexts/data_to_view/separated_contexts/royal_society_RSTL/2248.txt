It is true, that as the
plane at which the acid is dissolving tke oxide of zinc formed by the action of the
water, is in contact with the metal zine, there seems no difficulty in considering how
the oxide there could communicate an electrical state, proportionate to its own che-
mical action on the acid, to the metal, which is a conductor without decomposition. But on the side of the acid there is no snbstance to complete the circuit : the water,
as water, cannot conduct it, or at least only so small a proportion that it is merely an
incidental and almost inappreciable effect (970.); and it cannot conduct it as an
electrolyte, becanse an electrolyte conducts in consequence of the mutual relation and
action of its particles; and neither of the elements of the water, nor even the water
itself, as far as we can perceive, are ions with respect to the sulphuric acid (848.)*.

926. This view of the secondary character of the sulphuric acid as an agent in the
production of the voltaic current, is further confirmed by the fact, that the current
generated and transmitted is directly and exactly proportional to the quantity of water
decomposed and the quantity of zinc oxidized (868. 991.) : and is the same as that
required to decompose the same quantity of water. As, therefore, the decomposition
of the water shows that the electricity has passed by its means, there remains no other
electricity to be accounted for or to be referred to any action other than that of the
zinc and the water on each other.

* It will he seen that I here agree with Sir Humynry Davy, who has experimentally supported the opinion
that acids and alkalies in combining do not produce any current of electricity. Philosophical Transactions,
