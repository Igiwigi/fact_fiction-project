determined by comparison with a nickel-steel standard metre by the same makers,
which has been compared with the International Standards at the Bureau at
Sévres. The temperature coefficient and the correction to each reading having been
determined at the Bureau, the error of the brass metre could be ealculated. The
temperature coefiicient of the brass metre does not come into the measurements, as
the measurements on the coil and the comparison with the nickel-steel metre were
made at the same temperature.

Since-when the measurements were actually made, the nickel-steel metre had not
been returned by the Bureau, the following measurements are given in terms of the
brass metre, and a correction will have to be applied at the end for the difference
between the two metres. This difference was found to be proportional to the length
measured, so that it is probably due to the fact that the temperature coefficient of
the brass metre which was assumed in reducing the results is not quite correct. The
final result, however, is free from any error on this account.

In order to determine the distance between the mean planes of the coils, the
distance between the outside edges and between the inside edges was measured for
twelve positions equi-distant round the circumference. To allow of the setting otf
the cross wires of the microscopes being made with precision, the edges of the
grooves were turned quite sharp.

Three independent sets of measurements were made in this way, one set before
the magnetic measurements and the other two after. The results obtained, reduced
to a temperature of 16° C., are given in the following table :-— ,
