These equations are not of the canonical form, because R,, is not, the same for all the
planets. But it is easy to put them in the pseudo-canonical form (art. 74.), a process
which is not necessary, but saves trouble by bringing them under the operation of the
general rules of transformation established in former articles,

In fact, if we take ,

where the summation in the first term extends to all the planets, and in the s8econd
to all their binary combinations, and a horizontal line placed over any letter indicates
exemption from differentiation, we hall have
