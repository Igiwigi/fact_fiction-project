an essential component of ‘the right to one’s personality,’ they invoked European philosophical
and legal doctrine in articulating the right of an individual to develop his or her personality free
from unwanted publicity [7]. They advocated a common law recognition of a right to privacy, an
idea that has been highly influential, shaping the evolution of both common law and statutory
law across the USA.

In 1960, Prosser published a summary of the subsequent jurisprudence on the right to privacy,
finding that a majority of American courts recognized the right. Furthermore, he found that
privacy law had evolved to comprise four distinct privacy torts, including intrusion upon a


person’s seclusion or solitude, or into his or her private affairs; public disclosure of embarrassing
private facts about an individual; publicity placing one in a false light in the public eye; and
appropriation of one’s likeness for the advantage of another [8].

Modern US courts continue to frame informational privacy interests in terms of the four
privacy torts, carrying forward Prosser’s emphasis on redressing specific, tangible harms
resulting from a rather narrow subset of privacy-invasive activities. This narrow view of privacy-
related harms, requiring a showing of actual or imminent physical, financial or property injury,
has led US courts to dismiss many data breach cases for lack of harm. Even cases alleging that
an individual's sensitive information, such as his or her name and Social Security number, was
breached as a result of a company’s negligence have been dismissed for lack of injury [9]. These
cases suggest that the privacy torts are ill-suited to address many types of modern data privacy
risks, particularly those associated with leakages of information from releases of statistics for
which the possible injuries are unlikely to be actual or imminent. Moreover, tort law’s focus : =
