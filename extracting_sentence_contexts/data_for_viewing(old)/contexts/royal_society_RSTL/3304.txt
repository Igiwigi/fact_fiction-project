tiring waters of the sea; and the chief action of the rivers since that period bas been
to remove s8uch deposits; and when this was effected, to excavate a wall-sided gorge
in the solid rock. 2nd. During the vast period which must have elapsed since
the sea 8tood at the level of the upper shelves, the alluvial action has been exceed-
ingly small : steep slopes of turf over large spaces and the bare surface of rocks have
been preserved eyen perfectly; and we see eyery main, as well as most of the lesser
inequalities of the land, in the state in which they were then left. 3rd. The elevation
of this part of Scotland from the level of the present beach to the height of at least
1278 feet has been extremely gradual, and was interrupted by long intervals of rest :
it has taken place since the 80-called © erratic block period,” 4th. It is probable that
the erratic blocks were transported during the quiet formation of the shelves. One
was observed to occur at an altitude of 2200 feet above the level of the sea. 5th. The
extraordinary fact that a large country has been elevated to a great height s0 equably,
that the ancient beach-lines retain the same, or nearly the same curvature, which they
had when bounding the convex surface of the ancient waters. Lastly. The in-
ferences from this head, 8upported by other cases, namely, that a large area must
have been upraised, and that this was effected by a slight change in the convex
form of the fluid matter on which the crust rests ; and, therefore, that the fluidity is
sufficiently perfect to allow of the atoms moving in obedience to the law of gravity,
and consequently of the effects of that law modified by the centrifugal impulse, Hence,
that even the disturbing forces do not tend to give to the earth a figure widely dif-
ferent from that of a spheroid in equilibrium.
