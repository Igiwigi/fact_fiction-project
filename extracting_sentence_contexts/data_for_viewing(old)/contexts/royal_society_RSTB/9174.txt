The birth canal is broad both at the inlet, partly because of
long superior pubic rami, and at the outlet; the shape of the
midplane is not clear owing to poor preservation of the
iliac spines in the relevant fossils [2,37,60,74,116,119].

The pelvis in Neanderthals is typically very similar to
H. heidelbergensis in its morphology and large size [1,74,100,
120-126] (but see [127]). Except for a few uniquely derived
characteristics, particularly in the cross-sectional shape of the
superior pubic ramus (see [100,120] for reviews), recent work
has shown that most of the features of the Neanderthal

pelvis that were once thought to be distinctive are in fact
retained primitive traits [37,100,119-121,123,128].

The shape of the birth canal in most Middle Pleistocene
Homo specimens was primitive relative to modern humans
(although some may have indices within the modern human
range [16,37,116]). This implies a primitive (non-rotational)
birth mechanism in both H. heidelbergensis and Neanderthals,
although this is debated partly because of the paucity and
incompleteness of pelvic fossils [1,2,16,37,96,124,129]. How-
ever, birth canal size in Middle Pleistocene Homo is clearly
larger than in earlier hominins, generally within the modern
human range [16,74,79,119,121,124,127]. Presumably this enlar-
