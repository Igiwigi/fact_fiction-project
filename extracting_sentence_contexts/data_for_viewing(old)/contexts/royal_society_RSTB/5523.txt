The sclerotomic arches, as has already been stated, form corresponding to the caudal
half of each myotome and corresponding to the cranial half there is the spinal nerve
ganglion. The secondary segmentation displaces the position of the intervertebral
structure, so that the arch generally bends caudally and within this curvature the
spinal ganglion of the next cranial half segment of the myotome comes. The position of
the primary segment was from one intermyotomal region to the next intermyotomal
region. The secondary segmentation changes their position and a vertebral segment
is from the middle portion of one myotome to the middle portion of the next
myotome. The arches grow not only upwards but also extend their bases. With
their growth, the arches envelop the spinal cord completely and there forms a dorsal
projection which develops where the basidorsal of one side meets the basidorsal of the
other. These neural spines slant cranio-caudally owing to the fact that the arch itself

is a slanting structure.

The neural arches also extend dorsolaterally connecting one arch with the extension
of the next arch. These extensions of two consecutive arch elements are continuous
procartilaginous rods slanting craniocaudally which we have termed dorsointer-
vertebrals. Connective tissue cells get in to divide these rods into two. In the cases of
