erroneous character of this view. The nerve fibres in the cord respond to direct exci-
tation, like those in the nerve roots and nerve trunk ; that is to say, nerve impulses,
with their accompanying electrical effects, are propagated in both directions along
any continuous nerve fibres which may exist in the excited area; but, in addition,
complications are introduced by the connection of a large number of the fibres with
nerve cells, this connection causing now a possible decrease in the total electrical
effects, presumably by the blocking of the path and the falling out of certain
impulses, now an increase, presumably by the awakening of cells which lie in the path,
and the accession of fresh impulses generated in these structures.
~We will first state in general terms upon what facts rests our present bisnatiai
# the mode of propagation of nerve impulses, from an excited area of the cord along
e@ntinuous paths to a distant unexcited-area.

F(a.) It has been already pointed out in the historical introduction that the
ngthods of histological investigation, particularly those associated with the presence
ai developmental and degenerative changes, have unravelled from the skein of nerve
fijres in the cord certain tracts, and grouped them into columns of a continuous
primates in the lateral and posterior regions respectively. The limits of our
kgowledge have already been alluded to, but the inadequate character of the method
ishown by the large number of fibres which are displayed in each transverse section
Â® the cord, and the comparatively small number as to which a continuous connection
th other parts of the cord has been demonstrated.
