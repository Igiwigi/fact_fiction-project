holds for every multiindex a with |a| =k. Observe that using (3.15) and the embedding C,(RY) c
L, from proposition 3.1 we deduce the embedding D(A) ¢ wy”.

Concerning the drift term, it is interesting to point out that if 1 <p <oo the map ut |x|u is
continuous from wy? to Lb. It follows, in particular, that the map Lu = (Bx, Du) is bounded from
w,? into uy for 1 <p < ow: in fact

By the compactness of the embedding wy? (RY) oO uy (RN), 1< p < oo and the fact that T(t) maps
L? into wy? it follows that the semigroup T(t) is compact in L}, (RN), 1 <p <oo.

For 1 < p < 00, the semigroup T(t) is also analytic in uy (RY). The standard theory of analytic
semigroups and the above result imply that the angle of sectoriality 6, of (T(t))1+0 satisfies the
inequality 6, </2—06, where 6 is the spectral angle of Ap , that in turn coincides with the
spectral angle of B (the spectral angle of the generator of a contraction semigroup is the smallest
angle centred at 0 and symmetric with respect to the negative real axis which contains the
spectrum). Surprisingly enough, there are situations where 62 < 2/2 — 0. In these cases, the angle


of sectoriality is not determined by the spectral angle of Ay or, equivalently, by the spectral angle
of B, see [24, Example 1].
