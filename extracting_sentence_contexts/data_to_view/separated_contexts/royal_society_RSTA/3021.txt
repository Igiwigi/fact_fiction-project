The stronger version of the realist credo is therefore in tension
with QM, and this is at the core of relational QM. It is not even realized in the relatively weaker
sense of considering a juxtaposition of all possible values relative to all possible systems. The
reason is that the very fact that a quantity has value with respect to some system is itself relative
to that system [12]. This weak realism of relational QM is in fact quite common in physics laboratories. Most
physicists would declare themselves ‘realists’, but not realists about y.
