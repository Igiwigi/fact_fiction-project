This enables the field distribution at
large distances from the cable to be determined by employing a metallic sheet in place
of the water. (e) At high frequencies theory indicates (and the experimental results appear to be
in conformity with it) that the magnetic line of force above and below water are in
the form of circles tangential to the surface at points vertically above and below the
cable. This is explainable by the fact that since the velocity of propagation in the air
is of the order of a million times greater than in sea water the lines of force which would
travel outwards in circles concentric with the cable in the absence of water are retarded
so greatly in the conducting lamina as to be relatively stationary so that they are like
expanding rings pulled into the centre equatorially. (f) The magnetic field at the surface vertically above the cable diminishes with increase
of depth both due to increase of distance from the cable and to absorption. The latter
appears to follow an approximately exponential law agreeing fairly closely with theory.
