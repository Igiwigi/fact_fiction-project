When, however, the secondary radiator was a substance which emitted a radiation
differing considerably in character from the primary which produced it, the variation

in intensity of the secondary radiation by rotating the bulb was very much smaller
than in the cases previously considered. In fact, with the métals experimented upon
it could not be detected.

Using copper as the radiator, the almost perfect agreement between the relative
deflexions of the secondary electroscopes in the two positions of the bulb is shown in
Table IV.

Tin and iron also gave results similar to those obtained with copper. They are
shown in Tables V. and VI.
