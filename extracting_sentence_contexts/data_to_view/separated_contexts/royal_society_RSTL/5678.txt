In no single case, where this element occurs, is the substance capable of transmitting rays from a 8ource of
752% Faur. ; while in every case where it does not occur, the power of transmitting rays from this source is
manifested in a greater or less degree. Amber, gum, citric acid, alum, sugar-candy, tartrate of potash and
80da, are the substances which exercise this destructive agency upon the longer undulations ; #ce being the
most non-diathermanous transparent body hitherto examined. Turning to MerLoxT's list of liquids, the
same fact reveals itself. There is a sudden fall in the power of transmission at the place where hydrogen
enters the list. Protochloride of phosphorus transmits 62 per cent.
