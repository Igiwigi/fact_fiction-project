smaller. Finally, it must be remembered that the theorem given on p. 288 in the
section on Probable Errors does not lead us to expect @ priori any correlation between
degree of association and degree of defectiveness, and we must therefore demand
pretty clear proof of the existence of such an empirical relation. The facts shown
below that women are at once less defective and more highly associated than men,
and that partial coefficients of association in undefective universes are higher than
total coefficients, and much higher than partial coefficients in defective universes
(Tables IV, and V, pp. 306-307), may be said to bring some support to such a hypo-

thesis, but other explanations are here possible. The fact that the association
decreases throughout life, as far as we can judge from present material, while
defectiveness «also decreases in later childhood (cf below, p. 310) is against it,
Thus I do not think we can accept the hypothesis without wider evidence ; I have
mentioned it as it occurred to me, and would probably occur to others, as covering
certain of the facts presented.

§ 58. The foregoing figures of Tables I-III. show that all the defects dealt with by
Dr. WARNER are associated to a high degree, though this degree varies somewhat in
different groups of material. The question now arises, can we investigate further
the nature of the association between A and B or Band C? Suppose the hypothesis
to be put forward, for example, that low nutrition was the cause of both defects in
development and nerve signs, and that we only found the latter occurring together
