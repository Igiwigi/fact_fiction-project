Durr, of Queen’s College, Cambridge. Mr. Durr was
kind enough to allow me to examine his preparations for comparison—a fact which
helped me considerably in my work on Acmopyle. In particular, I would like to
thank him for allowing me to reproduce in this paper a photograph (Plate 11, fig. 31),
of the stone of a new species of Podocarpus discovered by Prof. Compron in New
Caledonia.
