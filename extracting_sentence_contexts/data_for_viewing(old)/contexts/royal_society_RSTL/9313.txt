the mean sphere—or more strictly the mean spheroid of revolution which represents
the average shape of the earth. The spheroid was endued with the power of gravi-
tation, and it was shown that the action of the spheroid on its own tides might be
found approximately by considering the state of flow in the mean sphere caused by
tho attraction of the protuberances, and also by supposing the action of the protu-
berances on the sphere to be normal thereto, and to consist, in fact, merely of the
weight (either positive or negative) of the protuberances.

Thus if @ be the mean radius of the sphere, w its density, 9 mean gravity at the

It was also shown that these two actions might be compounded by considering the
interior of the sphere (now free of gravitation) to be under the action of a potential
