Prof. ScuAver (2) also says (1910): “The nerve fibres are said to pass eventually
between the odontoblasts and to end in arborisations close to the dentine, but they
have not been followed into the dentinal tubules.”

Maarroér (3) described the nerve fibres as entering the reticulate cells of the pulp
which lie immediately beneath the odontoblasts, and that, these cells communicating
with the odontoblasts by means of the pulp processes of the latter, a direct
communication is established between the nerves and the odontoblasts. This
statement of Maarrér has not, however, been confirmed by any subsequent writer.

Another view is that the odontoblast cells really fulfil the function of nerve end
organs. This is the view advocated by Mr. Hoprrwerni-Smrru (4), who, while
allowing that the fact of the odontoblasts being of mesoblastic origin, while the
nerves are developed from the epiblast, makes it impossible to consider them as
ganglion cells, thinks they may still be considered to be sensation transmitters.
No nerve fibre has been seen to actually enter an odontoblast cell, although in
teased-out preparations fine varicose fibres can be seen surrounding them (/oe, cit.),
but, in accordance with the neurone theory of WaALDEYER, the interruption of
anatomical continuity would not necessarily cause any interruption in the physio-
logical path, and sensation could be transmitted without the actual continuity of
cell and fibril.

Bout (5), as long ago as 1868, in studying this question, employed a 4-per-cent.
solution of chromic acid. Examining fresh pulps treated in this manner, he found
an immense number of fine fibres in communication with the nerve fibres of the pulp,
