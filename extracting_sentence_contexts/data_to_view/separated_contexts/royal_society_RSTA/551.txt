S, is also seriously affected by errors of estimation in E,. We therefore reach the conclusion, from the study of the effects of simple disturbances on
the autoregressive type of variation, that no reliable estimate of the systematic sampling
variance can be obtained from the values of a single systematic sample. The fact of the
matter is that it is impossible to predict the behaviour of a sequence or function at inter-
mediate values from the known values at the equally spaced sampling points, unless the
mathematical law of variation is already known. The best estimate that is available from
the values of a single systematic sample appears to be Â£,. The general relation already
