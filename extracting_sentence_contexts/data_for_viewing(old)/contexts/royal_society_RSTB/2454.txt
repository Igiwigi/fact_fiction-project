ancestry. The new facts relating to the sorus are important in this connection ; such
large sporangia as those of H. dilatatwm compare with those of Gleichenia ; their

annulus and orientation are similar, though the dehiscence is lateral, and though they
arise in basipetal sequence instead of simultaneously. The output of spores per
sporangium in 7. Tunbridgense compares favourably with that in Ferns which have
a simultaneous sorus, and even the single sporangium of H. dilatatwin produces as
many as those of most of the Schizswacese. These facts are of the more importance
since the Hymenophyllacez are the only other Leptosporangiate Ferns whose sporangia
have been found to produce numbers of spores comparable to those which rule in the
Gleicheniacese, Osmundaceze, and Schizzeaceze.

With the exception of Trichomanes reniforme, which is certainly an unusual type
of the genus in having a more massive structure of the lamina,* all the species of
Trichomanes which have been examined show low numbers; and this I take to be
a result of reduction from a larger type, similar in nature to that seen in Todea,
though carried further. We have noted above (p. 41) that the “filmy” Zodeas
have a smaller output per sporangium than 7. barbara ; this suggests that reduction
of output accompanies the “ filmy” habit, and if this be so, then we may look upon
the simple sporangia of most species of Zrichomanes as simple by reduction, not by
