manifold M to have the single coordinate patch (T, x,0,¢). So M is the open submanifold T<0
of M and T is a smooth cosmic time function defined on M.

The metric becomes

1. - - -
ds? = ~-1)a7? +c 2(-Tm/ (1 + aT 4. ) do?. (5.21)

Set a =1— no, which means that 0 < @ <1. The conformal factor is given by

AT)= (—Tyn/(-m) , (5.22)

Since ng is greater than zero, the exponent will always be positive. Using this fact, we see that :=
limj_,- 2(T) =0 and 3c > 0 such that 2 € C?[—c,0) and @ is strictly monotonically decreasing
and positive on [—c, 0). Do
