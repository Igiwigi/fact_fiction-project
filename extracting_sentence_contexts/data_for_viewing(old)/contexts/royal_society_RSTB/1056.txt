a central plug of greater â€˜or less extent reaching into the middle of the yolk, which
thus fits like a thick-bottomed bowl on to the central mass; it is this ovoid mass
which meets the periphery of the ovum in a circle.

In favourable sections the nucleus may often be seen to be dividing in a more or
less longitudinal direction. Fig. 101 shows the spindle of the segmentation-nucleus.
As the first blastomere becomes constricted off, a transverse wall separates it from the
yolk-cell, which receives into its central protoplasmic mass one of the daughter-nuclei
of the segmentation-nucleus (fig. 102). Traces of the spindle are often seen after the
formation of the wall, and appear to penetrate the latter (figs. 102, 103). Finally
the two daughter-nuclei become quite separate (fig. 104).

Attention may be drawn to the fact that the axis of the spindle of the segmen-
tation-nucleus is not at right angles to that of the second directive spindle ; it is quite
possible, however, that rotation of the nucleus has taken place in the meantime,

(A.) Formation of the Second Blastomere.
Lepas anatifera.

The protoplasm of the first blastomere gives rise to a portion only of the ectoderm.
It has been supposed by all previous observers (Bucnuorz, Hor, Lane, Nasonov,
Nussbaum) that the ectoderm of the Cirripede arises by extension and division of
this cell only. Lane states that in Balanus perforatus the earlier stages are
