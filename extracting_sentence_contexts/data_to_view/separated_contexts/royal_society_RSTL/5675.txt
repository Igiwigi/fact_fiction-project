An hour
© afterwards, on removing the mustard, I saw to my great surprise that the 8mall area on
S which it had lain was red to the naked eye, and that its capillaries, examined microsco-
S pically, contained abundance of closely-packed corpuscles, while in swrrounding parts
S the blood was in the same condition as before the experiment, viz. of pretty healthy
= aspect. In other words, well-marked inflammatory congestion had been produced by
2 the mustard, and I afterwards found that the same thing occurred in a limb completely
Z gevyered from the body *. ES 'This fact of course completely eliminated variations in the calibre of the yessels and
| = consequent changes in the circulation from among the causes of congestion, and demon-
'S &trated conclusively its independence of the central organs of the nervous system.
= Further, it presented a very good opportunity for studying the state of the blood in
S healthy and inflamed parts, unaccompanied by the effects of rapid movement. In sub-
Z s8equent similar experiments, it was found that the corpuscles were not brought to the
E irritated area by anything that indicated a mutual attraction between the former and
£ the latter, but were simply carried along by slight accidental movements of the blood,
 8uch as are caused by pos?-mortem contractions of the arteries, and instead of moving
© with facility, as in other parts, stuck when they arrived in the vessels of the area, in
©  consequence of undue adhesiveness. The accumulation of the corpuscles was never to
S guch an extent as in cases in which the heart was driving the blood through the part,
A but it affected the arterial and venous branches as well as the capillaries.
