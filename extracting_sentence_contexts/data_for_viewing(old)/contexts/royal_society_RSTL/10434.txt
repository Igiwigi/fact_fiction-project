the young bud which is destined to form a sexual polyp. Moreover the zooid may
in some Pennatulids under s8ome cireumstances actually develop into a polyp, as
K6111KER states, and T have myself observed. The zooid is to be regarded therefore
as a bud in a state of arrested development, which has however acquired the power
of asexual multiplication.

We must therefore consider the difficult question as to the ageney which originally
caused the arrest of development in the buds. How, it may be asked, can in the first
place a bud have been produced identical in all respects with the buds which are to
form mature polyps, and yet incapable of full development ?

It is perhaps impossible to give a complete answer to this question, but the key to
the 80Jution of the problem lies possibly in the fact that the zooid, although in an
embryonic state, possesses nevertheless the power of asexual multiplication. As
pointed out on a preceding page, the secondary zooids of a group are to be regarded
as offspring of the primary zooid and not directly of the sexnal polyp on which they
are placed. We may therefore explain their rudimentary structure as the result of
inheritance from the primary zooid, and hence have only to consider how the latter can
have been produced.

Tt has already been stated that the primary zooid is almost always larger and more
perfectly developed than the secondary zooids derived from it. If, then, the secondary
