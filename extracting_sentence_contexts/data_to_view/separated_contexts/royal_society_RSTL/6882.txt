When the three external layers
have been removed, the fourth or central layer (Plate XII. fig. 4) is exposed. This
layer may be denominated the circular layer, or layer of transition, from the fact that
the fibres entering into its formation are circular, and form the boundary between the
external and internal layers. It differs from the other layers as regards the quality and
the direction of its fibres, and as regards its position in the yentricular wallâ€”the fibres
composing it, being aggregated into strong fascicular bands, whose course is neither from
left to right downwards as in the external layers, nor from right to left upwards as in
the internal ones, but horizontal or transverse. This peculiarity in direction, which
causes the fibres of the fourth layer ( #9,44 e) to run at nearly right angles to those
of the first (5) and seventh layers (Plate XIT. fig.
