had been firmly bound together with a ribbon wound many times round them : the
passage of the interrupted current through the lumbar nerves could not awaken in the
latter any general movement of the limbs, but produced a palpitation in the muscles
which appeared to diminish rapidly. The frogs thus confined showed an increase of tem-
perature during the passage of the current, but to a much less degree, being in each of the
two experiments about one-third less than that of the frogs which were suspended freely.

$2. I now proceed to treat of the development of electricity in muscles during
contraction.

Before entering more fully on this subject, I think it advisable to describe 8ome new
researches on muscular electricity. Two methods have been hitherto followed in order
to arrive at a rigorous demonstration of the principal facts and laws of muscular electri-
city. In one of these methods the muscular elements are united in form of a pile, and
the intensity of the muscular current increases with the number of muscular elements
of the pile: this fact 8uffices to exclude any doubt of the existence of electromotive power
which might be generated by the platinum plates of the galvanometer, or by the liquid,
in which the pieces of muscle forming the outer elements of the pile are plunged. This
doubt is also excluded by employing the nerve of the galvanoscopic frog instead of a
galyanometer.

The other method, which is that employed by Noni and myself in my earlier
researches on the electrical current of the frog, has been greatly improved by M. Du Bois
RevMoxnD, who has rendered it sure and of easy application. The apparatus of M. Du Bois
REeyMoOND consists, as is well known, of two small glasscs, in each of which is laid a thick
