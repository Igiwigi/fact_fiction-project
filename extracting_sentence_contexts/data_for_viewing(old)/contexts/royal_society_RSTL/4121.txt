I was desirous of trying whether the species of tetanic contraction, or rather of
corpse-like rigidity with which a muscle is seized after a shock from the jar, was dis-
sipated by the passage” of the current, direct or inverse, through its nerve. This is
not at all the case, and whenever it has occurred, the passage of the current has not
produced contraction.

I will here state that, acting with the electric current upon the nerves of living
warm-blooded animals, as rabbits and dogs, a phenomenon analogous to that which
we have studied in the frog is very clearly seen to follow the action of the inverse
current ; only it is observaþble that in these animals the tetanic contractions last a
much shorter time, especially if the vitality of the animal is very great; the same
fact besides is verified in the frog.

How is this tetanic action produced ? It is easy to convince oneself, if any doubt
could be entertained upon the subject, that there is no electricity rendered latent
either in the nerves or in the muscles by the passage of the inverse current. My
endeavours to discover signs of any, by the aid of the condenser, have been entirely
fruitless. Likewise there are no signs on opening the circuit of any electric current
in circulation. I have made myself quite certain of this fact by means of the galya-
nometer, employing at the same time a pile of tetanized frogs.

The phenomenon which we have studied thus at length belongs clearly to the
nerve, and takes its origin from the relation, the nature of which is yet undetermined,
which exists between neryous influence and the action of the electric current accord-
