It is probable that a binary compound of jodine and oxygene
may be formed, but the facts presented by the action of acids
on the triple compounds are not sufficient to prove its exist-
ence. When small quantities of very diluted sulphuric acid are
digested on the triple compounds of potassium and barium,
the fluid obtained is always acid, and always precipitates mu-
riate of baryta. I thought'it possible that the compound of
iodine and oxygene might possess this property ; but on col-
lecting the precipitate and examining it, it appeared to be a
mixture of the triple compound and sulphate of baryta, and
from all the facts it appears that in the action of acids on the
triple compounds new combinations only are formed.* ;

I take the liberty of proposing for the triple compounds the
names of oxy-iodes, because, when decomposed by heat, they

* When sulphuric acid is made to dissolye as much of the triple compound of po+«
tassium by heat as possible, the mixture congeals by cooling into a yellow transparent
substance, extremely deliquescent, and very acid. On decomposing it by heat, neutral
sulphate of potassa remains. Now as oxygene and iodine are the only substances
driven off by heat, it may be asserted that the acid property of the mixture depends
upon these two principles; yet this conclusion does not follow according to sound
chemical logic: iodine alone destroys the alkaline properties of porassa, aud oxygene
and iodine in combination with potassium form a difficultly soluble and almost taste-
less substance, This substance, the triple compound, has only a weak attraction for
Sulphuric acid, and it might be expected that in combining with sulphuric acid it
would not deprive it of its acid properties,
