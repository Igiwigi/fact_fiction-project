* Sometimes, however, there appears to be considerable yariation as to this proportion, as Looaz gives the
proportions of the carpus to the manus at 100, as follows: —Inuus, 105; Macacus gelada, 20; Semnopithecus
entellus, 12-03; S, comatus, 9:4 !

+ Dr. Incas in a note (loc. cit. p. 289) eriticizes Professor HuxLzv's remark © The bones of the first row

limit the motion of the wrist to flexion and extension. It is surely obyious that seyeral conjoined bones, 10
one of which * greatly exceeds or overlaps the rest,” may together produce a very considerable convexity.
Professor Lucan writes as if Protessor Huxtey had asserted that the proximal surfaces of the proximal carpals
wero all in one plane, instead of stating the undoubted fact that the projection of any one is small,
