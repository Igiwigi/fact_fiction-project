On the other hand, as compared with plot 4-1, with superphosphate of lime alone,
plot 8, with its continuous supply of soda and magnesia, and its residue from previous
applications of potass, in addition to the snperphosphate, yielded, on the average, more,
and sometimes considerably more, of almosb every gramineous species, the excess being
the most prominent in the case of Festuca oving and Avena elatior. Q The results of the complete separations show (and the fact is fully borne out by
Dobservation in other years) that the great reduction in leguminous herbage, consequent
Son the exclusion of the potass, is mainly due to a greatly reduced growth of Lathyrius
atensis, bub also to a decreased growth of Trifolium pratense and Trifolium repens ;
ewhilst, though in less amount than without manure, there is on plot 8, compared with
wot 7, eyen a slight increase in the yield of the deep-rooting, self-reliant Lotus
Sorniculatus. In fact, ib will be found throughout the experiments that the Legu-
Foinosz are only specially favoured by purely mineral manures containing potass, and
Shat, under the inflaence of such comparatively superficial supply of potass, it is the
BLathyrus pratensts which becomes by far the most prominent. S As has been aid, the proportion in the mixed herbage of the collective miscellaneous
Species has been, upon the whole, increased since the exclusion of the potass ; but, as
with the grasses and the Leguminosze, the yield per acre of the Miscellanew has declined
Fompared with plot 7, though there is still an excess compared with plot 3 without
Jnanure, The miscellaneous species which have maintained the greatest prominence
Shroughout are Rumex Acetosa and Achilles Millefolium, Conopodium coming next
n this respect ; but there has been very greab fluctuation in the proportion and amount,
af collective and individual miscellaneous species from year to year, according to
—eason. In the firs separation-year (1862), there was a small proportion and amount
Sf the collective Miscellanew, and no one individual species was in marked excess.
= the second separation-year there was more than three times as high a percentage,
nd more than two and a-half times as much actual yield, of snch produce, Rumea
RUeetosn, Conopodium denudotum, and Achillea Millefolium each being in excessive
amount, In the third separation-year there was less percentage, and only about
half as much actual yield, as in the s8econd; and now Achillea Millefolium yielded
nearly half the total miscellaneous herbage, and no other species was very specially
prominent.
