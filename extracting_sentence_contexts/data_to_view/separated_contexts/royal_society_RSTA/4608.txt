Three simulations stand out
in figure 4, NOLMUSHY, LAT_MELT and SST_TIME. Relative to REF, NOLMUSHY shows an
overall increase in congelation growth (+3750 km®) and a reduction in surface melt (—900 km?)
and lateral melt (—200 km’), compensated by a decrease in frazil ice formation (—3100 km)
and an increase in snow ice formation (+850 km) and bottom melt (+950 km’). The increase
in lateral melt in LAT_MELT (—2500 km‘) is largely compensated by a reduction in bottom melt
(+2200 km’) reflecting the fact that the heat available in the ML to melt the ice from below is
divided between lateral and bottom melt. In SST_TIME, a large increase in frazil ice formation is
compensated by less congelation growth and increased bottom melt. These compensating effects
are examples of the negative feedback processes that take place during the thermodynamic cycle
of sea ice.
