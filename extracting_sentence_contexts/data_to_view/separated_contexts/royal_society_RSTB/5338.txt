DE BEER ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE SHREW.

carotid of Lepus is not the same vessel as that of similar name in other forms: that the
carotid foramen of Lepus is likewise different ; and that the alicochlear commissure is
not the trabecula. In answer to this, it may be said that the entry of the carotid artery into the cavum
epiptericum as described by Vorr in Lepus is altogether exceptional. Gaupr (1911)
draws attention to the fact that in Talpa and in Mus, the carotid enters directly into the
cranial cavity. The same is true in Phocwena (DE BuRLET, 1913a) and in Echidna
(Gaupp, 1908). In the cat, â€˜Terry (1917, p. 383) says that the alicochlear commissure
* does not, in the cat, enter into the floor of the cavum epiptericum, nor does the carotid
artery pass directly into the primary cranial cavity.
