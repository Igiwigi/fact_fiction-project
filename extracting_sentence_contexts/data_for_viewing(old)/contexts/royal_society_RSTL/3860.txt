Slightly enlarged. In a third instance the intermediate leg on the left side had been
cut off quite close to the body, and yet the larva had undergone its change without
any haemorrhage ; the wound was completely healed, but there was scarcely any de-
velopment of the injured surface. In the fourth example also the first and second

legs on the left side had been cut close off, but the basilar joints in these were elongated,
and the insect cast its skin without difficulty. In the fifth specimen, which cast its
skin during the very moment I was examining it, the facts were still more satisfac-
tory. The middle leg on the left side had been removed, but the basilar joint, as in
the other instances, had become elongated. Besides this, a portion of the posterior
leg on the same side had been removed at the tibial joint, and this had now been re-
produced with the tarsus and claw. Tt now formed a short leg, very obtuse at its
extremity, with the minute black claw sunk in its apex. This fact sufficiently proved
to me that a power of reproduction exists in insects which undergo a complete meta-
morphosis, as well as in those which do not change their form, and it led me to watch
with greater assiduity the passing of these individuals into the pupa state.

At the expiration of nine days from the commencement of the experiments (June
1st), one of the larve, that was nearly full-grown when operated on, snspended itself
to enter the pupa state. At that time there were only seventeen specimens $till living
