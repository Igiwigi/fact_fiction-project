inadvertently subjected to a sudden change in temperature the larvae would
sometimes become abnormal or would all die. It is interesting to note that whenever
the mortality became high, a test showed that the fy of the sea-water remained the same
as that for fresh sea-water, and was never too alkaline or vitiated by possessing too
high a CO, content.

The greatest relative mortality occurred just after larval torsion, when the larvae
appear to start feeding. Since the physical and chemical factors of the environment
seemed to be satisfactorily provided for, attention was turned to the food supply.
Nitzschia did not seem to be a suitable food organism, and many larvae were reared
equally well without adding this diatom to the water. Occasionally the addition
of Nitzschia was actually harmful, as too large a quantity would cause the larvae to
become enmeshed in tangled masses of the diatom. Taking these facts into con-
sideration, it would seem that the factor limiting the rearing of these larvae is that of
food. The use of sea-water which had not been filtered was tried in an attempt
to provide the natural food, but the appearance of small crustacea and other harmful
intruders invariably followed. Another method adopted was that of placing the
larvae in a breffet jar covered with bolting silk (fine silk net) and placing the jar in

the circulating sea-water of the laboratory. The most successful attempts, resulting
in the partial metamorphosis of several animals, were carried out in this way.
