were purified, a very small amount of
impurity would account for the difference which I have lately found. At the time the
values appeared very low, compared with those of other experimenters, but it was then
thought that the higher ones were due to traces of silyver. Experiments, however, have
proved, on the contrary, that most of the gold-silver, gold-copper, &c. alloys conduct
electricity worse than pure gold; and that, in fact, only those which contain less than
2 per cent. gold in gold-silver alloys, and about 3 per cent. gold in gold-copper alloys,
conduct better than pure gold.
