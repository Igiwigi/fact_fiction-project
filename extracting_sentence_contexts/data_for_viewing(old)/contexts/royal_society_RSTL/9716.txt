Since in this case the quantity in square brackets vanishes in virtue of the factor
(a?+£)2*1, we may replace cos xt by cos (xt+a), « being any constant, 80 that the
solution of the differential equation may be written

If in the differential equation a? be replaced by —, this integral becomes

differential equation, as it in fact contains only one arbitrary constant, For, evidently,

8 that the introduction of the constant « does not increase the generality of the
solution.

Returning to the integral (46), we find, on putting #=0 and transforming the
integral by the substitution t=1"v,
