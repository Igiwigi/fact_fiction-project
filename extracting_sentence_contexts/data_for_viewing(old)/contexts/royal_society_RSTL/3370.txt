drical piece of wood partly immersed in a jar of water. If one pole of a power-
ful bar be now carefully approximated towards the like pole of the suspended
magnet, by fixing the former in a brass frame carrying a micrometer-screw,
the latter will be observed to recede from the bar, until the opposed poles
are within a certain distance of each other ; when the repulsion will cease, and
a weak attractive effect ensne. The cylinder of wood as it becomes gradually
immersed *, continually furnishes an equiyalent to the repulsion, in the quan-
tity of water displaced.

We do not generally perceive the attractive effect resulting from this indue-
tive action in non-ferruginous masses; for, as already observed, their feeble
retentive power admits of the magnetic neutrality being more rapidly restored,
when the tension passes a certain point. So that in fact, the opposite magnetic
state never becomes sufficiently intense to evince an attractive force, cogni-
zable by the ordinary means.

* Amore detailed account of this experiment may be found in the Transactions of the Royal Society
of Edinburgh.

36. When, therefore, a disc of any substance is put into a state of rotation
under a suspended magnetic bar, opposite poles are induced in that part of the
disc immediately under the bar ; these induced poles may be supposed to pass on,
