key computation that is relevant in the development and
maintenance of depression.

Importantly, the salience network helps accomplish multi-
modal integration (its spatial topography strongly overlaps
with the multimodal integration network as documented
in [57]). Moreover, as we have documented, primary intero-
ceptive cortex (in the dorsal mid to posterior insula) is a
component of the salience network, ensuring that every
mental event (not just emotions) is infused with interoception,
which is made available to consciousness as affect. This state of
affairs provides the recipe for affective realism, where people
experience supposed facts about the world that are created in
part by interoception and the associated affective feelings
[17]. Food is ‘delicious’ or ‘distasteful’. People are ‘nice’ or
‘mean.’ Affective realism leads people to believe that objects
and people in the world are inherently negative or positive.

Finally, we hypothesize that neurons within the fronto-
parietal control network sculpt and maintain simulations
for longer than the several hundred milliseconds it takes to
process imminent prediction errors. We hypothesize that
they apply attention to adjust the degree of confidence in sen-
sory predictions (i.e., adjusting priors) and they may also
help to suppress or inhibit simulations whose priors are
