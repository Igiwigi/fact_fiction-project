preserved specimens are known from the Early Cretaceous,
including Eomaia [8], Acristatherium [9], Ambolestes [10], Sasaya-
mamylos [11], Sinodelphys [10,12] and Prokennalestes [13]. The
early evolutionary history of metatherians is even less well
documented [10,14,15]. Further complicating the understand-
ing of the divergence of metatherians and eutherians is the fact
that characteristics historically used to define each clade (e.g.
molar count, size of carpals) have recently come under ques-
tion with the placement of the previously earliest
metatherian, Sinodelphys, within Eutheria [10]. Gaining a
better understanding of the evolution of early eutherians
relies on fossil discoveries in the Late Jurassic and Early Cre-
taceous that are based on associated cranial, mandibular and
postcranial material. Here we report a new basal eutherian
consisting of a partial skeleton from the Lower Cretaceous Jiu-
fotang Formation, Jehol Biota.
