would be highly important for the purpose of enabling us to trace the course of
the cotidal lines, and ought to be attended to in eyery maritime s8uryey.

In a coast broken into bays, there would be many points of divergence and
convergence on a small scale. In order to determine the general conrse of
the tide-wave, it would be proper to make observations at points similarly
Situated ; for instance, at all the principal promontories, or in the parts of the
bays nearest the open sea.

It would also be proper to attend to the course of the flood and ebb m"â€” |
$0 as to determine from what quarter the tide comes according to the common
notions on the subject. It is to be recollected, that this is not necessarily the
quarter from which the tide-wave comes ; but a knowledge of one fact may be
of service in determining the other. In channels where the stream of flood
and ebb run alternately in opposite directions, it is highly important that the
time of slack water, as well as of high and low water, should be noted.

The publication of tide observations, as originally made, may be of the same
use as the same proceeding in other departments of astronomy. _ It enables all,
who are able and willing, to employ snch observations in exemplifying, cor-
recting, and extending the theory, and in verifying what is done by others in
these ways. The publication of the Sheerness Tide Observyations, recently di-
rected by the Council of the Society, may thus be a useful step. It may be
noticed that the Sheerness tides, like the rest of the Thames tides, are probably
compound, being derived partly from the north and partly from the south
