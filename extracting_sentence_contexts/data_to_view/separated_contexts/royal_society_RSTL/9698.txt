The inquiry would naturally
Z involve the observation of the nearly constant rate obtained at somewhat lower
S exhaustions; and the same apparatus would serve for experiments on the rate of
=Z 8ubsidence at higher densities, up to that corresponding to atmospheric pressure. Â£ A comparison of the rates of subsidence in different gases at great but not extreme
SZ exhaustions was further interesting as a new means of determining the ratios of the
L viseosities of different gases. In fact, at high exhaustions the motion of the gas tends
2 to a condition of ideal simplicity from which a comparison of the viscosities of different
S gases would immediately result. The effect of the viscosity of a gas on its own motion
Q 1s regulated by the value of a constant which I have elsewhere* called the index of
friction of the gas, namely, the coefficient of viscosity divided by the density. Accord-
