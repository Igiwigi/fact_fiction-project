Figs. 25-28 relate to cylinders of rectangular section, figs. 25 and 26
giving the field distributions for cylinders of square section placed with one of their
diagonals at 45° to the field and parallel to it respectively. In fig. 25, where the
width of the cylinder remains constant along the direction of the impressed field,
we notice that the lines inside the cylinder are concave outwards ; in fig. 26, on
the other hand, where the cylinder tapers rapidly as we proceed along the field, the
curvature of the lines presents a convexity outwards. This suggests that an inter-
mediate form between the two might be found for which the lines exhibit neither
convexity nor concavity, #.¢., are straight ; and, as a matter of fact, we know of one
such intermediate form—a circular cylinder. Fig. 26 closely corresponds to the
theoretical case which Dr. C.
