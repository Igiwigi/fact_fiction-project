This may be due to some bias of chance errors, but
it does not seem likely to be, as the data for the first series also support it. There-is no
evidence of such an effect in the COCI, data for the spherical electrode plotted in fig. 4,
but it may be masked by the errors of observation. In fact, the experimental data
which look most reliable for this part of the curve point to a rising current with rising
negative voltages in those experiments. On the other hand, although the matter was
not explicitly tested at the time the experiments were made, the chlorine data which
form the basis of fig. 7 show, on re-examination, a distinct drooping tendency towards
higher voltages. The evidence is thus not clear that this tendency is peculiar to the
cylindrical anode.
