The stomach (Plate XXXIIL. fig. 1 I) itself is a comparatively large and sacculated
cavity, of an ovoid shape, the sacculi giving it s0mewhat the aspect of a bunch of grapes
where the berries are closely compacted together. Each little pouch or sacculus has
in its-centre a large clear nucleus; and on comparing it with the stomach of Votom-
mata claviculata (Enrex.), in which hepatic ezca are appended to each sacculus,
there is reason to think these nucleated cells also subserve the function of a liver. This belief is further countenanced by the fact of the stomach, when employed in the
digestion of the food, assuming a yellowish brown colour, and at least the whole pro-
cess of assimilation is performed in this cavity alone. There is no other orifice to
the stomach except the cardiac or c80phageal one; hence there is no intestine, and
the siliceous $hells of its prey, and other rejectamenta, are brought back to the pha-
rynx /and rejected by the oral 'orifice. In this process also we see- the forcipated
jaws frequently assisting to eject/the larger portions of the digested food.
