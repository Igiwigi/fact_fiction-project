Now, Mr. Parrerson* finds that at ordinary
temperatures n= 10". The effect of temperature on the resistance of carbon
indicates that the concentration of the corpuscles would be at least ten times as
great at 1000° as at 0° C., so that we should expect to find n of the order 10”. As
a matter of fact, if we take ) = 5°2 x 10* instead of 7°8 x 10%, we find n = 5 x 10?!
instead of 10*%.

Reasons which might make this method of determining » give values which are too
large, will be considered at some length after the experiments on sodium have been
described.
