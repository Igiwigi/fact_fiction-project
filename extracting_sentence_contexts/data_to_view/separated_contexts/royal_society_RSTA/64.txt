is not possible to use meshes as fine as in analyses carried out on one or a few unit cells. In fact, to be able to simulate the forming of the whole part, the finite-element model of a woven
cell has to be simple enough while describing the main phenomena at the mesoscopic scale. Different approaches are developed for the purpose of the simulation of the deformation of a
whole preform with meso finite-element models [58-60]. In this work, each woven unit cell is modelled as a set of shell elements as shown in figure 8a.
