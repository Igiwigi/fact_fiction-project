Thus the gentleman
went on destroying one of them daily until he had killed seven ; but all to no pur-
pose—the remaining magpie 50on found another mate. The nest was finished, and
young ones were produced, which were suffered to fly. This is an extraordinary
fact.—It seems to show that nature has a reserve of birds in an unconnected state,
immediately ready to repair losses. Were the whole to pair at once, the circum-
jacent country might be insufficient to furnish food for the immense number of
young ones that must burst forth at the same time.


22 The late Dr. JENNER

finishes this business in 'a shorter space of time than any

other bird, but as he deviates 80 widely from the common

laws of the feathered society, I shall select the s8wift, as a

better example for pointing out the fact.
