This is also a character, I
find, of phosphoric acid recently ignited per se. The acid of our salt possesses
also the property of coagulating albumen. In fact, this acid appears to be the
glacial phosphoric acid, which had been hastily assumed by recent writers
| upon this subject to be the pyrophosphorie acid, but is totally different. I shall
i take the liberty to designate provisionally the acid of the fused biphosphate of
s0da, the Metaphosphoric acid, from an hypothesis of its constitution to be
immediately explained ; and the fused salt itself, the Metaphosphate of soda. The metaphosphate of soda is insoluble in alcohol.
