Miall & Greenwood’s paper was published in 1878
and that of Forbes in the following year, and these authors described a well-defined
vagina, the former in the Indian and the latter in the African elephant. Watson then
dissected a female Indian elephant, which he described in 1881, and found a condition
differing from all previous accounts (see p. 115). In fact, the structure he found has not
been reported in any other specimen. Assuming this specimen to be normal, he wrote:
‘There are few (mammals) in which the vagina, in respect of anatomical structure,
presents so close a resemblance to the uterus as does that of the elephant.’ In a second
specimen, however, which was of normal configuration, Watson (1883) found the vagina
quite clearly distinguishable. In the present investigation it was always found possible to
insert the hand from the cavity of the vagina, when that organ was cut across in sztu, into
that of the urogenital canal.
