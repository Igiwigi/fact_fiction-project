The fact that successful intragroup breeding makes inter-
group kidnapping behaviour less likely suggests that
kidnapping involves effort that makes it a last resort option.
It generally only occurs at the end of the breeding season
after groups had tried to raise their own young. Groups
with no breeding success face a high possibility of decline in
territory size and group size before the next breeding season
due to the probable stochastic events of predation, dispersal
and death of current group members [44]. Kidnapping
young may therefore be a way to maintain group size that is
only adaptive when other alternatives fail. Its facultative
nature predicts limited occurrence: groups do not routinely
exchange offspring. This latter alternative, although hypotheti-
