However, recall that in
general there are many different unit structures that all apply to the same CTMC. We are free to
choose among those unit structures. And as it turns out, no matter what the CTMC is, we can
always choose the unit structure in a way that guarantees that equation (4.1) does in fact hold. I prove this result in several steps. First, in electronic supplementary material, appendices
F and G, I derive a set of lower bounds on EP that always apply, no matter what the unit
structure.
