weakened, as will be shown in the second part of this paper.

The assertion that the rhythm of the heart is normally due to separate impulses
discharged from the motor ganglia in the venous sinus, each of which causes a contrac-
tion of the cardiac muscle, is nob intended to imply that these impulses necessarily
travel along simple nerve fibres without passing through one or more interpolated
ganglion cells, but only that whatever the nature of the path of the conduction of the
nervous impulse may Ã¾e, separate discharges from the motor ganglia at one end of the
path reach the musele as separate impulses ab the other end.

So, too, I have spoken of the motor ganglia. in the venous sinus without meaning
thereby to assert that these ganglia may not extend slightly beyond the sinus into the |
auricular septum as asserted by Low1iT* (for as a matter of fact experiments which I
have made expressly for this purpose have convinced me of the truth of his assertion),
or that the other groups of ganglion cells found in different parts of the heart may
not upon occasion perform motor functions.

The whole question of the action of these different groups of nerve cells deserves
separate discussion. In this paper I have purpostly abstained from tha discussion
because my object is to describe certain definite well established facts rather than to
enlarge upon all the various topics connected with the theory of the heart's action.

In this first part of the paper, therefore, T have confined myself to the question of
the relation of the muscular tissue to the impulses coming to it, and have attempted to
prove not only that the normal beat of the heart is dependent upon separate impulses
