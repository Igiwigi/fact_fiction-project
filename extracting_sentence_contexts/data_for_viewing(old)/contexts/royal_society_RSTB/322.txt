cornu, and sometimes reversely, the blunter end, devoid of any obvious cell process,
is directed centrally, while the tapering extremity mingles with root-fibres on the
distal side, and is turned away from the grey matter of the cornu.

In rare instances is observable a deviation from the usual shape, which is less
easy to reconcile with a belief that the cells are all of fairly regular bipolar form,
Such an instance is represented in fig. 8, Plate 4. The impression is given of
possession by the cell of two processes issuing from the cell-body in somewhat close
juxtaposition, and both turned in a direction absolutely away from the grey matter
of the dorsal horn, A little eminence rising from the ventrally-directed edge of the
cell, is all that can suggest the giving off of a process toward the grey cornu. This
very slight suggestion is perhaps strengthened by the fact that nerve-fibres (of the
roots) in their centripetal path sweep by the little eminence in question, and the
direction in which the eminence is set is certainly the same as theirs. As will have
been gathered, the outlying cells strongly resemble in form the cells of CLARKE’s
column. This may be easily seen by a comparison of the two in one and the same
section, especially in the lowest portions of the column, where, in Man, as pointed
out by Morr,* the arrangement of the component cells so as to have their longer
axes parallel to the long axis of the cord is not so marked as is the case higher up.
There, where cells of Cuarke’s column may thus be viewed lengthwise in the same
transverse section as contains the out-lying cells, the similarity in shape between them
is too obvious to be overlooked.

There is also a correspondence between the two in size. Measurements made of
