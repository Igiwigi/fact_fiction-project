The system can achieve each dynamics by taking various values of the system parameters Fo,
y, B, t, Ag and . In order to understand the dynamical processes, we take Nj = 10° in all the
simulation. We perform our numerical studies with the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm
for stochastic processes developed by Kasdin [45]. Equation (2.1) is integrated over a time long
enough as N + 1 periods. The time step is h = 0.027 /w, and the initial velocity is x(0) = 0 because
the particle is at rest at the bottom of the deformable potential.

(a) Input energy and input energy distribution of the system

Input energy is in fact equivalent to work done by the field. In a noise-driven underdamped
nonlinear oscillator, it mainly depends on the different initial positions taken by the particle
on an entire space period of the RP potential substrate. In figure 2, we show the variation of
the input energy averaged over a trajectory for a feedback strength 6 = 0.08, time delay t = 1.5,
for the temperatures T = 0.001 and T = 0.04, and for the values of r indicated in figure. As one
can see the input energy can exhibit one, two or three narrow band when the initial position
of the particle varies at low temperature T = 0.001. For r= —0.3, the work done by the particle
is generally confined around only one band Ej, ~ 0.0016. When r= 0, Ein displays three narrow
bands around 0.07, 0.12 and 1.16. This shows that the particle is clearly in three energy states, but
the particle remains less in the second state. However, for r= 0.3, Ein is around the values 0.143
and 0.554. With increasing temperature, the input energy changes and the response at certain
shape parameters can become strongly enhanced by noise. At lower temperature, input energy in
the sinusoidal profile is larger than in the non-sinusoidal profile. In figure 2, plotted for T = 0.04,
