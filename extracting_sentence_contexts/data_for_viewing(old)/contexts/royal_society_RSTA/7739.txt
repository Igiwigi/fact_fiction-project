Zminima with G(f) about 0-009 for # about 2 and 4 respectively and then drop to zero for
68<1. These two materials give the lowest possible value of G(f) for longitudinally mag-
Snetized magnets. On the other hand, if it is possible to use very long and thin transversely
£ magnetized rods one can obtain lower values. For instance, a Ticonal rod 20 times as long
as wide (f = 0-05) would give G(f) = 0-0057. Unfortunately, the mechanical properties
of these brittle alloys make it very difficult to manufacture such thin rods. However, they
‘B could perhaps be made in a number of pieces and then mounted in line.

It will be noticed that Vectolite, a sintered oxide powder, gives almost the same
performance as Ticonal K for £<0-25.

Though in principle one can obtain as low a value of G(f) as one pleases by making £
small enough, the fact that, according to (19a), G(f) varies only slowly with #, makes it
necessary to go to very long and thin transverse magnets to gain very much. Thus to reduce
B from 0-05 to 0-01 would only give a reduction of H, in the ratio of 1 to 1/5' = 0-59. Such
; long and thin magnets could only easily be made of a ductile material such as Vicalloy

which can be drawn into wire. However, existing materials of this type have appreciably
worse magnetic properties than the brittle alloys or the sintered oxides. Magnets which are
very long in the vertical direction are also inefficient in cases where the field to be measured
decreases rapidly with height. Further, there seems some doubt if it is possible to

magnetize such thin wires of isotropic material transversely.
