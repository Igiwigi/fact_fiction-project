Hence we see that for f* =f*(c), we have

ft =i) * otmc™ o ft =i) * att.

m=0 m=0

Further we note that if q(x, y; t) = 5(x — y) + q'(x,y;#), then q(k, x; t) = 5(k — «) + q’(k,«; £). The Dirac
delta function 6 here also represents the identity with respect to the ‘*’ product so that for any
w €L?(R?;C) we have w* 5 =5 x w =w. With all this in hand, we can in fact explicitly solve for
p=plk,«;t) and q = 4q(k, x; t) as follows. Lemma 3.5. Let p = p(k,«;t) and q = q(k,x;t) denote the two-dimensional Fourier transforms of the
solutions to the linear base and auxiliary equations just above.
