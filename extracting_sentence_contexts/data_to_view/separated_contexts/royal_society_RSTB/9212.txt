Our
simulated approximation (thin solid line; blue online) used an exponential
onset of time-constant of 20 ms and an offset time-constant of 200 ms. For comparison, a crude simulation of primate phototransduction dynamics
(using an exponential time-constant of 20 ms for both onset and offset) is
also plotted (dashed line; red online). For our purposes, a crude approxi-
mation of time-courses was adequate; more accurate modelling of these
time-courses can be found in [7] and [60], respectively. (b) The image of
a child scooting (same as figure 1a). (c) The image of figure 1a was in
fact taken from a movie sequence. Here, we show the image frame of
figure 1a, with the movie filtered using the temporal dynamics of LiGluR-
MAGOjgo. Rather dramatically, the sluggish temporal dynamics causes the
scooting child to almost completely disappear.
