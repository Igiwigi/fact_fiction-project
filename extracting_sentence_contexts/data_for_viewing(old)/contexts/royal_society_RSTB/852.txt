the anterior nerves.

We have already seen that the fibres of the anterior commissure not ouly con-
tribute to the formation of the anterior nerves, but also pass to the two dorsal cell
groups. It is thus possible that the directly decussating fibres of the anterior nerves
are in part connected with the dorsal cell groups of the opposite side.

Some of the fibres of each anterior nerve may be traced directly into the more
dorsal portion of the ganglionic plexus. These probably are connected with nerve

= cells by lateral branches, but the connection cannot be seen. in sections. It is
& probable from the fact that a large number of the fibres of the anterior commissure
8 end in the plexus, that a crossed connection exists between each anterior nerve and
i the plexus of the opposite anterior ganglionic enlargement.

& The following, then, are the central connections of each anterior nerve :—

g 1. With both external and median dorsal. cell groups of each side, but mainly with
S those of the same side.

cs 2. With the dorsal plexus of each side.

Finally it should be remembered that the dorsal cell groups of the same side are
‘5 connected by the dorsal arcuate fibres.
