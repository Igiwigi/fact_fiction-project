when the animals were dissected, it was found that, in all, the musculo-cutaneous
gave off at the elbow a large branch which joined the median nerve. This large
communicating branch might have contained efferent nerve fibres which contributed
to the supply of the fiexors, and in Experiment IIL the physiological examination
proved this to be the case.

On comparing these results with the results published by others, it is found that
the only somewhat similar experiments published, with which a comparison can be
instituted, are those of Sreranr (13) and of CunnincHam (16). In Rawa’s (10)
experiments, the nerves divided were the posterior tibial and peroneal, and as one
crossing only was made between the two nerves, the other two ends being widely
excised, he had, therefore, as already mentioned, no case of nearly perfect restoration
of function. From this cause, and from the fact of the experiments having been
conducted on the hind-limb, a fair comparison cannot be made.

In the case of SrerANr’s experiments, the crossing was not exactly the same as in
the experiments here recorded, not involving the entire supply to the muscles below
the elbow. Thus, of the four experiments of which he gives details, three consisted
of crossing the median alone with the musculo-spiral. His remaining experiment,
which consisted in a crossing of the median and ulnar with the musculo-spiral, and
which was therefore more complete, was unfortunately vitiated, as the crossing did
not turn out to be efficient. In two of his experiments, in one of which, however,
the crossing was not absolutely efficient, the restoration of function followed a course

which was very closely the same as in the experiments here recorded. Thus the first
