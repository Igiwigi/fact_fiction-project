has made a study of the development of the stem in several Poly-
podiaceous species. I have been ableto confirm his results for the most part. Curiously enough, he does not draw attention to the fact that the data of develop-
ment do not support Van TrrGHEm’s theory of polystely resulting from repeated
bifurcation of the young concentric cylinder. The figures of Lecterc pu SABLON

show that the central cylinder of the young stem quickly becomes a concentric tube
with foliar gaps.
