The abrupt break shown in text-fig. 5 is accom-
panied by transverse breaks as seen on the surface of the walls of the tracheides
(Plate 4, fig. 16). In this case, also, the sectional view of the walls shows slip-lines
inclined at about 45Â° to the edge of the wall. The failure, therefore, occurs by slipping
along radial planes in the substance of the cell-walls, but extremely few slip-planes
are developed in any one tracheide, prior to rupture taking place (Plate 4, fig. 16),

The facts for the tension failures of Spruce, Ash, and Pitch Pine are in harmony with
those already described for the compression failures of these woods. Failure takes
place, both in tension and compression, by the development of planes of slipping or
shearing in the substance of the cell-walls. In tension failures of brittle samples of
Spruce, of normal Pitch Pine and generally of normal Ash, the planes of slip are
identical with those obtained in compression.
