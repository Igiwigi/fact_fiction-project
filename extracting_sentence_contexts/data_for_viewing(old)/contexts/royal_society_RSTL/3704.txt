In describing the parts to the north of NP, the Kuen-Lnen range, HumBoLpr states,
that between that and the Thian-Schan ranges there is a considerable depression.
* CarL Zimmerman,” he remarks, © has made it appear extremely probable, that the
Tarim depression, that is, the desert between the mountain chains of Thian-Schan
and Kuen-Lnen, where the steppe-river Tarim-gol empties itself into the Lake of Lop,

which used to be described as an Alpine lake, is hardly 1279 English feet above the
level of the sea.” Again, he informs us that the line KL (in fig. 4), though once
8upposed to be a chain of mountains, is a line of broken country ; and the west of
this line we know to be lowland.

38. Guided, then, by such data as I have been able to gather, I assume, as the best
general representation of the facts, that the Doubtful Region of the Enclosed Space to
the north of QR, and outside the circle about A which bounds the Known Region,
Slopes gradually from 10,000 feet down to 2560 at M, and then rises again at the
same angle to J, And I shall assume that the parts of the same region to the south
of QR, and not included in the Known Region, slopes at four times that rate. In

fig. 5 I have laid down the Enclosed Space on a scale, and, for convenience of
reference, drawn parallel lines over the whole of the Doubtful Region, marking the
elevations of the yarious parts according to the assumed law.
