observed in young guinea-pigs, but the processes appear in our preparations to be held
up during scurvy owing to cellular degeneration, figs. 10 and 11. The “ amorphous
calcification of predentine ” is what we have described as calcific deposits sealing off
the dead primary dentine, figs. 5a and 6b. It remains, therefore, only to consider
whether the tissue found in the pulp during subscurvy, or when the animal is recovering
from an attack of acute scurvy, is, as we suggest, calcific scar tissue or whether it is a
new deposit of bone in the pulp, as previous writers have thought.

It is suggested by these workers that a degenerating pulp in which the odontoblasts
have admittedly lost their fibrils and all the cells are distorted, has suddenly developed
osteoblasts and laid down large masses of bone. This is said to occur although the
ordinary bone cells of the jaw are themselves degenerating and finding it hard to survive,
and despite the fact that even a healthy pulp is incapable of forming bone. Indeed, it
is difficult to see what use a dental pulp would have for a bony skeleton in any circum-
stances ; so useless indeed would the tissue be that it would have to be regarded as
virtually a neoplasm.

The only evidence that the new tissue is bone is its superficial resemblance to bony
trabecule, though in ground sections this resemblance entirely disappears, fig. 12. It
is also suggested that the degenerating cells included in it resemble osteoblasts. There
are, however, no Haversian systems to be seen and no embryonic mesoderm cells which
might be developing into osteoblasts—on the contrary, all the pulp cells, so far from
undergoing mitosis, are admittedly degenerating, and it is difficult to see how any of
them could be mistaken for osteoblasts. The cells are, in fact, so degenerated that it
would seem impossible from their appearance alone to say what they had been. Even
