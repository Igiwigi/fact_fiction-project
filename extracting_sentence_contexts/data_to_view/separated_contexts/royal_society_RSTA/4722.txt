Hence, the Kochen-Specker theorem is
equivalent to the fact that the spectral presheaf, our quantum state space, has no points. This
was first observed by Isham & Butterfield [5] and, for the case of the von Neumann algebra B(H),
by Isham et al. [6]. Mathematically, the fact that © has no points is an expression of its character as a non-
commutative space. Physically, we see that the lack of points is equivalent to one of the key
theorems in foundations of quantum theory, the Kochen-Specker theorem.

(b) Previous results on the spectral presheaf as a quantum state space

The interpretation of the spectral presheaf ¥ as a quantum state space is supported by a number
of further results:

— In classical physics, propositions about the physical world are represented by (Borel)
subsets of the state space S, and the Borel subsets form a o-complete Boolean algebra. In [8], it was shown that there is a distinguished family of subpresheaves (the presheaf
analogues of subsets of a set) of the spectral presheaf 2, called clopen subobjects.?
