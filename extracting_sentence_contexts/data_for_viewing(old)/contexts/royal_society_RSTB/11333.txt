strate and cofactor-binding site of Sirt2. Most importantly,
the fluorescently labelled probes (4a/b) enable the mapping
of inhibitors /ligands binding to either the ECS or ‘selectivity
pocket’, which would not necessarily show a competition to
the substrate or cofactor in enzyme kinetic analyses. As the
TAMRA-labelled probe (4a) provides a larger assay
window than the FAM-labelled probe (4b), we focused on
the application of 4a for further studies. To validate the suit-
ability of our 4a-based FP-assay for fragment screening, we
tested fragments of SirReal2 (2a) to assess their potency to
compete with 4a for Sirt2 binding. As expected, fragments
of 2a prevented our TAMRA-labelled probe (4a) from bind-
ing to Sirt2 (figure 5f). In accordance with the fact that
methylation of the pyrimidine moiety in positions 4 and 6
is beneficial for binding to Sirt2 [55], we noted here that the
dimethylated fragment (4,6-DM-2-MTP) provokes a signifi-
cant decrease in 4a binding to Sirt2 as compared with the
fragment without methyl groups (2-MTP). No effect was
observed for nicotinamide (NA), which was used as a nega-
tive control because the SirReals were previously shown not
to be bound to the NA-binding site of Sirt2 [55]. Additional
information on assay conditions and procedure can be
found in the electronic supplementary material.
