That this body is simply formed by a union of the cyanide and nitrate in these pro-
portions without decomposition, is confirmed by the fact that, when the crystals are
treated with strong hydrochloric acid and the whole evaporated on a water-bath,
Succinic acid can be detected in the residue. The acid is evidently formed by the action
of the liberated nitric acid on the cyanide of ethylene. The crystals are soluble in
water and alcohol, but insoluble in ether.
