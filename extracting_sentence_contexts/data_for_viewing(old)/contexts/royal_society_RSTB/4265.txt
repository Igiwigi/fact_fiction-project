After the injection of 0.2 em. of 1 : 1000 venom solution into the inflow tube, the
outflow at first diminished and then returned nearly to its former velocity. This
action resembles that of adrenaline. But that they are not identical was proved by

ON THE ACTION OF COBRA VENOM. 25

the fact that when ergotoxine (1 : 50,000) was present in the perfusion fluid, adrenaline
did not act on the vessels, while the action of the venom remained unchanged.
Isolated organs of the rabbit, such as the ear, leg, and kidney, were perfused with
Ringer’s solution, and the outflow from the vein was measured.
When the venom was injected into the inflow tube the outflow suddenly diminished
and then slowly returned nearly to its normal amount.
