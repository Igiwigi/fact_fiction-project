* It may be useful to point out that although we are frequently witnessing controversies in which
authors try to defend one or another system of the theory of probability as the only legitimate, I am
of the opinion that several such theories may be and actually are legitimate, in spite of their occasionally
contradicting one another. Each of these theories is based on some system of postulates, and so long
as the postulates forming one particular system do not contradict each other and are sufficient to
construct a theory, this is as legitimate as any other. In this, of course, the theories of probability
are not in any sort exceptional.

Both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries are equally legitimate, but, e.g., the statement
“the sum of angles in a linear triangle is always equal to x” is correct only in the former. In
theoretical work the choice between several equally legitimate theories is a matter of personal taste
only. In problems of application the personal taste is again the decisive moment, but it is certainly
influenced by considerations of the relative convenience and the empirical facts.

t The problem of the definition of measure in relation to the theory of probability has been
recently discussed by Eomnickr and Uta (1934), who quote an extensive literature. A systematic
outline of the theory of probability based on that of measure is given by Kotmocororr (1933).

(2) that for the class ((B)) it was possible to define a single-valued function,
m (B), of (B) which will be called the measure of (B). The sets (B) belonging to
the class ((B)) will be called measurable. The assumed properties of the measure
