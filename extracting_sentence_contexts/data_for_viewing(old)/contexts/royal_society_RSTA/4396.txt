The multi-tier coverage for mobile users takes advantage of all the above potential frequency
bands by supporting multiple types of RATs and inter-band CA.

(b) Millimetre-wave mobile backhaul/fronthaul

A multi-structure mobile fronthaul provides system resilience, flexibility and increased overall
bandwidth capacity. The benefits of exploiting MMW for fronthaul transmissions include
high capability of wireless data transmission, simple deployment and adaptive environmental
suitability, as MMW bands provide multi-gigahertz available bandwidth without the burden of
distant cable wiring.

To reach high spectral efficiency, advanced MMW technologies are desired for signalling,
and this is realized by the supporting fibre-wireless convergence. In fact, many RoF links over
MMW bands have been proposed and experimentally demonstrated in recent research. Bit rates
above 100Gbs~! have been attained by adopting spectrum-efficient modulation formats and
digital coherent detection enabled by fibre—-wireless convergence [28-30]. Different approaches for
the realization of a high-speed fibre—wireless integration system as mobile backhaul/fronthaul,
including optical polarization division multiplexing (PDM) combined with MIMO reception
[31,32], advanced multi-level modulation, multi-carrier modulation [30], antenna polarization
multiplexing [33,34], MMW CoMP transmissions [35,36] and multi-band multiplexing, have
been proposed [37]. These approaches can effectively reduce the signal baud rate as well as the
required bandwidth for optical and electrical devices. Crosstalk due to polarization rotation and
MIMO transmission can be effectively solved based on advanced DSP algorithms, including the
classic constant modulus algorithm [30]. Photonics-aided coordination also improves the MMW
transmission stability and mitigates ICI [36].
