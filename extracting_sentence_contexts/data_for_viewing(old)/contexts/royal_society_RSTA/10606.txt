alteration in the temperature of the room impossible.

It was found that if a continuous water current from the main was passed between
the two cylinders (even if the current was passed simultaneously in different places
between the cylinders as well as between the front and back sides of the cylinder,
and the water from the main was used only after half an hour or an hour, when the
temperature of the water from the main ought to be constant), very large deflections
of the galvanometer, as much as several centimetres, were observed, and these varied
continuously though the thermopile was closed to light and should have given no
deflection at all. Obviously the temperature of the water from the main is never
quite constant, continually varying by several thousandths or even hundredths of a
degree Besides this, layers of different temperature may exist in the bulk of the
surrounding water owing to the fact that the temperature of water from the main
is lower than that of the room, and that it must take a long time before the
6 or 7 litres of water in the cylinders are replaced by fresh water from the main,
i.e., the bulk of the water is exposed to the influence of the warmer temperature of
the room for a longer time, and this warmer water is being continually mixed with
the cold water from the main. This difficulty was finally overcome by leaving the 6 or
7 litres in the cylinders to assume the temperature of the room, giving up the stirring
altogether and replacing the same by the water current from the main. Through
this the difference between the temperature of the water and that of the room was
made very small, i.e., the warming of the water between the cylinders by the
surrounding temperature of the room was made exceedingly slow. It should be
observed that-it is not the constancy of the temperature of the air space of the
inner cylinder which we require, but that the variation of its temperature should be
