rounding context. For these reasons, music ensembles have
been considered a valuable model to investigate the complex
dynamics of sensorimotor communication during joint
action [3]. In fact, music ensemble performance constitutes
a special example of joint action that possesses critical advan-
tages. Most notably, music possesses important constraints
that allow better experimental control such as the fact that
performers move in a complex but yet formalized manner,
following musical conventions and, in most cases, a musical
score. With respect to other experimental scenarios, such con-
straints are an ecological way to both reduce the number of
experimental variables and overcome technical issues. For
example, the fact that performers strictly follow a musical
score allows for comparisons between different ensembles,
something that would be more difficult in analysing, for
instance, teamwork at a meeting, where discussion and
work in different teams may follow significantly different
paths. Moreover, music enables offer opportunities for ana-
lysing subtle aspects of non-verbal communication. For
example, music often explicitly aims to convey emotion to
an audience, which is not usually the case in, say, computer
gaming. Finally, scenarios such as dance and sport usually
encompass full-body movements that develop in quite a big
space, something more difficult to capture accurately with
optical motion capture systems.
