Using multilevel ordered logistic models, we found that,
regardless of all other factors, gossip about rivals was more
negative (8 = —0.29, p < 0.001, model 1; electronic supplemen-
tary material, table S1) suggesting that players tried to
improve their own position to the detriment of rivals. When
the competition was low, in the cross-checking condition, we
did not detect any dishonesty about rivals (6 = 0.42, p< 0.05,
model 2; electronic supplementary material, table S1), which
means that the opportunity for cross-checking significantly
holds back negative gossip about rivals compared to the
control condition. This apparent counterforce disappeared
in high competition (6 =-—0.86, p<0.01, model 2; electronic
supplementary material, table S1), despite the fact that dishon-
esty has not been intensified by competition (6 = 0.27, p = 0.18,
model 2; electronic supplementary material, table S1).

Apart from the distortion created by rivalry, gossip was
sent in an honest way in the sense that it was aligned with tar-
gets’ PD decisions (if sender was an involved PD partner in a
given round): if the target defected, then gossip was less posi-
tive (6 = —-1.36, p< 0.001, model 2; electronic supplementary
material, table S1); while if the target of gossip cooperated
with the sender, then gossip was more positive (6 = 1.35, p<
0.001, model 2; electronic supplementary material, table S1).
