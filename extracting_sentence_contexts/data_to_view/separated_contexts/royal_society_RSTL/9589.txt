PHYSIOLOGY OF PEPSIN-FORMING GLANDS. 697

When the sccretion produced by a gland contains nndissolved particles, these particles may be stored up
by the gland, thus fat globules are apparently stored up by the cells of the Harderian and Mammary glands. I do not overlook the fact that a glycerine extract of the fresh Mammalian gastrie mucons membrane
contains a good deal of pepsin, but I believe this to be due simply to the zymogen being more easily split
up in these glands than in others. Tt will be remembered that the granules of the © chief ” cells which
probably consist in part or wholly of zymogen are not preseryed by osmic acid; 7.e., these zymogen
granules split up with osmic acid, whilst the other zymogen granules we know of do not. Further, as
| mentioned above, EpsTEix and GRiTzNeR have shown that the gastric glands of Mammals do contain

8ome zZymogen.
