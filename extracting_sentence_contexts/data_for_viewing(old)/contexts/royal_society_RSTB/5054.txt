subsidiary in another; 1, 2, 5-11, 15, 20, 21 are subsidiary in two polyps. Mesenteries
15, 17-21 belong to different couples in polyp and bud. The numerical ratios of
principal to subsidiary mesenteries in the polyp and two buds of fig. 20 are roughly
1:5, 1:3, 1:2. The sagittal planes of the three stomodeea do not correspond with
one another.

Owing to the depth and irregular contour of the corallites, to the oblique position of
the buds on the inner surface of corallite-walls and to the fact that adjacent corallite-
walls meet at angles without flat perithecal intervals, the appearance in the skeleton
