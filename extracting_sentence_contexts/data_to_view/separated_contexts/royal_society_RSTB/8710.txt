As the Bayesian

framework is computationally intensive and incompatible
with the size of NGS datasets, a heuristic approach has been
introduced with no apparent loss in sensitivity. This approach
is based on neighbour-joining trees and non-parametric boot-
strapping for an evaluation of node robustness [132]. We
acknowledge the fact that species absent from the database rep-
resent an important drawback of this method, as large portions
of the biodiversity remain uncharacterized. Using a promising
approach based on fuzzy theory and COI sequence data,
Zhang et al. [133] have shown that this problem could potentially
be addressed during the analyses. Despite this, building a good-
quality reference sequence database, properly curated and even
including taxonomically validated samples, still represents an
essential component of all metabarcoding projects [102].
