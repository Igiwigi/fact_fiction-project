Appendix B is devoted to the question of how to calculate the analytical solutions (3.3), (3.12)
and (3.17) in a simple particular case. Here, we use the analytical dependencies (B1)-(B5)
derived there.

Figure 1 demonstrates the steady-state particle-size distribution function f; versus the radius
s of particles and relative crystal withdrawal rate Go. At any fixed value Go, the distribution
function represents a bell-shaped curve. This function also decreases with increasing Go. As one
can see, the crystal withdrawal rate is one of the main system parameters, which controls the
stationary distribution function in a metastable liquid.

Figure 2 shows the analytical solution of the Cauchy problem (B 1)-(B 3) for the determination
of a transient behaviour of the relative temperature n (or u) and polymerization degree Â¢ (or w).
It is easily seen that the dimensionless temperature increases with time. This is due to the fact
that the metastability degree reduces with time as a result of the release of latent heat by the
growing crystals, which in part compensates for the supercooling. The polymerization degree
initially increases because the polymerization rate exceeds the withdrawal rate of melt at small

dimensionless crystal withdrawal rates: Gp = 1 (a) and Go = 3 (6).
