ventral pyramid ”—i.e., ventral portion of the sclerotome—“ extends with its apex
above the chorda, and founds there (separated from the ventral mass by the
subsequent rapid growth of the chorda and its sheath) a cluster of cells, which
remains henceforth behind the basal mass of the dorsal pyramid ; this latter, through
its downgrowing apex, founds a colony of cells, but below the chorda and in front of
the basal ventral mass. Thus are produced the basalia and interbasalia. Each
colony of cells retains its potentiality of developing into a separate independent piece
of cartilage.”

The cell-clusters that become the basidorsal and interdorsal cartilages are aia to
undergo separation from those that develop into the interventral and basiventral
cartilages by the rapid growth of the chorda and its sheath. This appears to be in
accordance with the facts, for transverse sections through embryos of the appropriate
stage of development show, at the sides of the notochord, a thin layer of not more

than two or three cells; but, when the authors proceed to affirm that the dorsal and
ventral parts are ‘“‘connected only by the indifferent connective tissue of the
membrana reuniens, but not by cartilage-forming cells,” a protest may be lodged,
for, while at this particular epoch of development the connective tissue is
“indifferent,” it really does in many cases possess the capacity for forming cartilage.
The capacity is not evinced until the arch-cartilages are well differentiated.
