S Compared with the produce without manure, there was, however, on the average,
1 slight increase of gramineous, a decrease of leguminous, and an increase of mis-
Sellaneous herbage, the result being but insignificant increase of total produce.
Â© The column showing the average increase or decrease in the yield per acre of each
Andividual species by superphosphate of lime alone, compared with the uamanured
Slot 3, shows a slight increase in quantity, in the order named, of Holcus lanatus,
Poa trivialts, Avena flavescens, Lolium perenne, and Avena pubescens, a very slight
Lnerease of Cynosurus eristatus and Dactylis glomerata, and an actual deficiency of
SBriza media, Agrostis vulgaris, Alopecurus pratensis, Anthoxanthum odoratum, and,
Shough very trifling, even of Festuca oving, Upon the whole, therefore, the increase
As partly, though not entirely, among some of the better agricultural grasses, and as
has been aid, it was due rather to consolidation of tissue than to increased luxuriance
or sneculence ; in fact, to stemmy development but with dwarf growth.

Of the Leguminosze, Trifolium pratense and Lotus cormiculatus yielded less in each
separation-year than without manure. On the other hand, in the three later of the
four years, Lathyrus pratensis gave some increase, and on the average Trifolium repens
gave a very slight increase. Lastly, on this plot of languid competition, and coincident
great variety of species, we have in the las two separation-years a 8mall quantity of
the hard-wooded, somewhat shrubby Ononis arvensis, which is scarcely observable on
any other plot. Tt is also on this plot of languid competition, and on one other plot
only, that fairy rings develop in any marked degree.
