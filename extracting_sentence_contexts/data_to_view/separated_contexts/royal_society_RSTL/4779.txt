In the action of terchloride
ET phosphorus, the formation of a methyl- or ethyl-compound of phosphorus, correspond-
g's in composition to the terchloride of phosphorus, might be with certainty expected :
& PCl, + 3MeZn = 3ZnCl+Me, P
B These anticipations were in fact fulfilled. The products of these reactions, the bases
e,P and E, P, which we propose to call respectively trimethylphosphine and triethyl-
hesphine, remain united with chloride of zinc, and a simple distillation with an alkali
Allone is necessary to liberate them. 37nCl, Me, P+6KO=3KCl+3(KO, ZnO)+PMe,
3ZnCl, E, P+ 6KO=3KCIl+3(KO, ZnO)+PE..
