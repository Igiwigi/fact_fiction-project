zy=w, ſor in this case Supposing we are acquaint-
ed with a particular solution of (@) containing any number
of arbitrary constants, such as

on=A {a, a, b, c, &. }
we may substitute for each of these constants an arbitrary
function, such as © :
x {, 14, 7*Þ, ee fon]
for it is evident this function does not change when we substi-
tute f" w for x. But this form of F'is not always correct, it may be incon-
sistent with the original equation. In fact, the only value we
can assign to f which shall not in some measure limit the
generality of the Problem, is to suppose a particular solution
of the given equation. As an example of this method take the following problem. D
