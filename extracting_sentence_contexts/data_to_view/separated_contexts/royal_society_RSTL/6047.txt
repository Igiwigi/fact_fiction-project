It is to be remarked, that it is not by any means necessary that the word or the
words plane, point, and line, or consequently the words order and class, should have the

respectively ; and Suppose, first, that the words point and line, and therefore order and
class, have also the ordinary significations as regards the two figures Toapoctinily; we
have here the ordinary theory of homography, in which, to any. range of Points or
pencil of lines in the first figure, there corresponds a homographic range of Points or
pencil of lines in the second figure, and to a curve of any order and class in the first
figure there corresponds a curye of the same order and class in the second.
