quently, near the horizon, a great thickness of atmosphere having been trayersed by
the rays which reach the upper station, even the obliquity of the passage to the
lower station does not (unless the inferior strata be particularly loaded with vapours),
cut off anything like a corresponding portion of solar heat, and a second equal mass
would intercept till less.

- 80, Fifthly, and lastly, the maximum of intensity is s0oner attained above than
below. This arises, no doubt, mainly from the fact (amply confirmed by the hygro-
metric curves), that the sun shines with a disproportionate intensity during the
morning on the upper station, owing to the mass of vapours being then in the valleys.
The solar intensity will therefore attain an earlier maximum, since after ten or eleven
o'clock a quantity of vapour rises between the upper station and the limit of the at-
mosphere, and therefore throws the maximum rather before noon. In the plains, on
the contrary, where the whole atmosphere is all day between the observer and the
sun, the maximum will incline towards the period of maximum dryness of the day,
that is, it may be an hour or half an hour after noon. The curye of mean dampness
VII. with its point of contrary flexure in the afternoon, entirely confirms this view,
and the diurnal curve of temperature at Brientz, marked I., shows both inflections in
the clearest manner.
