(d) The oxygen content of oxygen-hydrogen mixtures

Test analysis: A mixture of the pure dry gases was made up containing 50-46%
oxygen. Results of three separate analyses of this mixture:

Volume of residual Oxygen content

Volume of gas after removal found

mixture taken of oxygen %
(1) 13-873 6-873 50-46
(2) 14-133 7-004 50-44
(3) 13-475 6-675 50-46

Duplicate analyses of six different oxygen-hydrogen mixtures:

(e) The oxygen content of oxygen-carbon monoxide mixtures

The determination of the exact composition of mixtures of these two gases presented
an unexpectedly difficult problem. The normal method of determining the oxygen content—by the removal of this
gas with alkaline hydrosulphite and the subsequent measurement of the ‘residual gas”
—was found to be inaccurate owing to the fact that carbon monoxide combines slowly,
even at ordinary temperatures and pressures, with caustic alkali solutions. Careful
experiments made with simple aqueous (dilute) caustic soda solutions showed that
carbon monoxide was absorbed at the rate of about 0-1 c.c./hr. under the conditions
obtaining in the absorption pipette; qualitative tests on the product showed the
presence of formate in the alkali solution.
