It should be noted, however, that as in § 15


NORMAL PRESSURES ON A PROLATE SPHEROID, 245

it was not possible to repeat accurately any particular speed : the speed quoted is, there-
fore, the mean of a number, each of which approximates very closely to the mean. The
actual speed has, of course, been used in calculating the coefficients. Further, in view of
the fact that the pressures have been divided by V* and not by v*, there area few points
where the pressure coefficient exceeds unity. 20. The method of procedure may be expressed symbolically as follows :

p is the pressure at a point P.

V and v the speeds through the air of the centre and of P respectively.

V, and v, the speeds over the ground of the centre and of P respectively.

V, = 2, the speed of the static pressure tube over the ground.

V, and vy, = RQ and R’Q respectively (Q the angular velocity).
