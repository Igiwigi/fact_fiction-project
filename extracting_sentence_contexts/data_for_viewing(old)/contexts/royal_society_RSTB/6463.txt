The generally accepted view of the distribution of the nervous elements in the
Asteroidea, as stated in modern textbooks, is that of CufNor. The nervous system
is described as consisting of three parts, of which the ectoneural system, of ectodermal
origin, is sensory, while Lange’s nerve (hyponeural) and the apical nerve, of
presumed mesodermal origin, are regarded as discrete parts of a motor system.
Cufnort’s account, however, requires confirmation in many respects. In the first
place, no morphological demonstration of the continuity of the sensory and motor
systems has been made, although a separation of the two parts is, of course, impossible.
Secondly, the histology and distribution of the nervous elements of Lange’s nerve
require further study. Thirdly, the apical motor system discovered by Cusénor in
Marthasterias glacialis, Asterias tenuispina, Echinaster sepositus, and Astropecten aurantiacus
has been shown by Meyer (1906) not to be present in Asterias rubens. In view of
this fact, the presence of a separate apical system in the asteroids would appear to
be a matter of doubt. Moreover, even if an apical system be present in some or all
of the Asteroidea, its connexions with other parts of the motor system or with the
sensory system require to be demonstrated. Finally, the histology of the ectoneural
system, although described in great detail in Mevyer’s excellent account, needs
verification in some particulars. The present work has been directed, in particular,
to the elucidation of the points in question.

The work, the results of which are embodied in the following account, was carried
out in the Departments of Zoology of the Universities of Manchester and Sheffield
and at the Laboratory of the Marine Biological Association, Plymouth.
