global oil industry, has had to establish reliable measures of risk. Crichton (2007)
1imself has designed the Risk Triangle, a framework for adaptation and
modelling, which takes into consideration the relative importance in any given
ype of naturally caused risk of the natural hazard, the vulnerability of people and
oroperty and their exposure to risk in their actual situation. For example, 93% of
1omeowners in the UK have private insurance cover including flood. The UK
insurers realize that they not only need to map flood exposure but also to manage
it. In fact, insurers have better flood maps and flood data than the government.
Crichton pointed out that the UK government has regulated neither planning nor
yuilding design to allow for the effects of climate change (though new regulations
are planned in the UK; DEFRA 2006; CABE/CIC 2007). Governments have
ailed to ensure resilience of communication systems. During Hurricane Katrina,
hree million phones were disabled (although in India cell phone warnings of
cyclones are provided to millions of people and in 14 languages). In Carlisle,
England during the 2005 floods (10000 homeless) all communications were
disabled except coastguard radios. However, in Scotland all cell phone
ransmitters must be in safe locations to ensure continued operation during a
flood. Sewage and drainage networks are also at risk with flooding. Crichton
stated that UK hazards are growing due to global warming with increases in
severe rainfall events, rising sea levels, higher storm surges, more droughts and
