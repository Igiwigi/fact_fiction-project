found for AMAR emerge as one moves from the present day to +2°C and +4°C
worlds, with 71 and 74 per cent of the basins showing an ensemble mean increase
in stress (decrease in WSI) at +2°C and +4°C, respectively. For river basins tha
show an increase in stress, the stressed areas generally grow in spatial extent anc
magnitude as one moves from +2°C to +4°C, with 71 per cent of basins becoming
more stressed.

A number of rivers show a different sign of change for WSI at +2°C anc
+4°C. The Godavari, Tapti and Yangtze basins show a decrease in WSI in a
+2°C world and an increase in WSI in a +4°C world; the opposite trend occurs
for Dniester, Garonne, Oder, Vistula, Rio Grande de Santiago, Sacramento anc
Chubut basins. The change in population and the directions of change in run-
off in these basins for both temperature regimes are in fact the same: it is the
magnitude of the changes in run-off and population that results in the opposite
signs of change in WSI for the two temperature regimes. For the first set o
yasins, the changes in run-off are small and close to natural variability in a +2°C
world. An increase in the population is observed for the 2060s, hence there is an
increase in stress. However, in the +4°C world, the increase in run-off is much
arger, thereby showing a decrease in stress. The reverse is observed for the seconc
set of basins.
