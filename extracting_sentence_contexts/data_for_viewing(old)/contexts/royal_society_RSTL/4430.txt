carbonate of ammonia was taken, the acidity of the urine, after food was taken, was
diminished to a greater degree than it was when the volatile alkali was taken.

The comparison between Plate XXI. Philosophical Transactions, 1849, which re-
presents the acidity of the urine when liquor potass was taken, and this Plate, which
shows the acidity when carbonate of ammonia was taken, is also very interesting, as
it establishes the important difference of the effect of volatile and fixed alkali on the
acidity of the urine.

That 138 grains of carbonate of ammonia, taken in three consecutive days, should
not diminish the acidity of the urine is very remarkable. It is still more worthy of
attention that it actually increases the acidity. It appeared very desirable to test these
facts by further experiments.

(47.) The experiment with large doses of carbonate of ammonia was therefore re-
peated. For comparison, the day previous to that on which the carbonate of ammo-
nia was taken, the yariations in the acidity of the urine were determined. Breakfast
