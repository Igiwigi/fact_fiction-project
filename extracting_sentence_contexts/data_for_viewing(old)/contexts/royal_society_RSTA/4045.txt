obtainable metallofullerenes such as M@Cg2 (M = metal atom), even today, detailed experimental
investigations on the formation mechanism have so far been very limited. One of the main
reasons of this is that the formation of metallofullerenes is basically occurring under plasma
conditions at very high temperatures like 4000-10 000 K either by laser-ablation or arc-discharge
synthesis. However, it has been known that there are two primary important routes for growth of
endohedral metallofullerenes: (i) top-down formation, i.e. a graphite fragment originating from
the target is directly involved; (ii) bottom-up growth, ie. formed initially from small carbon
clusters and atomic carbon. In the following, both mechanisms are discussed based on the recent
experimental studies.

One of the serious drawbacks of the top-down mechanisms is that the presence of giant
fullerenes has not been experimentally confirmed. The top-down mechanisms are based on
the fact that very large fullerenes, the so-called giant fullerenes, exist in carbon plasma. The
only experimental evidence they ascribed is mass spectral observation of row soot-containing
