The SLS strength
of these joints was, however, similar to joints obtained at 310 ms vibration time, which did show
fully welded overlaps (figure 6b). These results indicate that owing to a potential effect of the welding process parameters on
the uniformity of the weld quality, the SLS strength might lead to erroneous conclusions when
attempting to optimize the process. In fact, the non-uniform stress distribution at the weldline
during the SLS test makes its results insensitive to the presence of un-welded patches of a certain
size in the centre of the overlap as shown above. Consequently, one needs to consider that the
quality of the weld at the edges of the overlap has a higher weight on the results of the test
and thus the SLS strength might not provide an accurate picture of the overall weld quality. Finally, it is interesting to note that the SLS strength was not sensitive to the occurrence of fibre
distortion in the adherends either (figure 6c).
