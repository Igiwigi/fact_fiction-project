Apparently, then,
these animals have a definite breeding season in Simla. My own investigations show that the M. rhesus, which live on the plains about
Muttra, breed at a different time of the year, and yet that they also have a definite
breeding season. The fact that a very large proportion of the adult females supplied to me during
January, February, and March, bore advanced embryos in utero, and further, the fact
that of those supplied in March a very large proportion had already borne young,
points to the conclusion that March is the usual month when most of the young are
born at Muttra. Thus it is seen that the breeding season in Simla and in Muttra occurs at quite
different times, and it would seem highly probable that M. rhesus living in other
parts of India, may have different breeding seasons also. The geographical range of
this species is very great, it is found over an area bounded by Kashmir (latitude 34)
to the Godavari River (latitude 17), from Bombay (longitude 73) to Bengal (longi-
tude 90), from an altitude of nearly 10,000 feet down to near sea-level ;* and the
