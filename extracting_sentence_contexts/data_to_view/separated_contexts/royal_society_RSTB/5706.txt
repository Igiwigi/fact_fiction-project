II. In the second part of the book, in which these results are applied
to plants, Van Irerson investigated the positions in which the primordia arise when
the phyllotaxis is constant and when it is changing. He concluded that constant
phyllotaxis is maintained as a consequence of the following “ facts of observation,”
as he calls them :—

(1) The relative radius of the insertions of the new primordia (the factor 6) is the
same as that of the young primordia that are already present. (2) These primordia are in contact with at least two older members. (3) They are laid down in the larger gaps between the previous leaves.
