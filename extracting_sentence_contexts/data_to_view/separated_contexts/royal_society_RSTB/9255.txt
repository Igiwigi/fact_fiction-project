This study is corroborated by a human sleep depri-
vation study of CSF levels of amyloid protein, revealing that
sleep-deprived normal subjects have higher levels of amyloid
protein in their CSF [70]. These observations collectively
account for an inverse relationship between body mass and

ments that have been performed to slow down metabolism = &
appear to provide some supportive evidence for a role of
metabolism in tumorigenesis. In fact, processes that curb
metabolism appear to prolong the lifespan of experimental
animals and diminish cancer incidence [72]. Caloric restric-
tion from yeast to mice has been clearly linked to
prolongation of lifespan and decreased tumorigenesis in cer-
tain cancer models [73]. Although the basis for the effects of
caloric restriction in cancer is complex, an effect on cellular
metabolism has been implicated.
