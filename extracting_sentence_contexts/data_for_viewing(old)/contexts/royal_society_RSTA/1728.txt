Theorem 2.6. Let n> 2, 1 <p <oo and assume that 2 C R" is a standard domain of class C3. Then
the Stokes operator defined by

Apt:=PAu, D(Ap):= W??(2) 0 Wa? (2) NLE (2), (2.6)

generates a bounded analytic Cy-semigroup Tp on LE (@) and

(a) o(Ap) = (—00, 0] if 2 is R", RY or an exterior domain,
(b) o(Ap) C (—00, —«] for some k =K(@2) > 0 provided 2 is bounded,

The above Theorem 2.6 goes back to several authors, who proved various assertions of the
above theorem by different methods. In fact, maximal L?-regularity estimates for the Stokes
equation (1.1) due to Solonnikov, see [33,36], imply, in particular, the existence and analyticity
of the Stokes semigroup Tp on L5.(@). A very different proof for the case of bounded domains
with smooth boundaries was given by Giga [37]. His approach is based on Seeley’s theory on
pseudo-differential operators rather than on localization methods. For other approaches, we refer
to the work of Grubb & Solonnikov [38], Farwig & Sohr [39], Maremonti & Solonnikov [40] and
Geissert et al. [41]. Borchers & Sohr [42] and Borchers & Varnhorn [43] were the first to prove
that the Stokes semigroup on exterior domains is uniformly bounded. The fact that the Stokes
semigroup on exterior domains is a bounded analytic semigroup is due to Giga & Sohr [44]. The
case n = 2 goes back to Abels [45], who was in particular able to treat the case of small resolvent
parameters. For the case of domains with non compact boundaries, we refer to §2e.

There are very many more results in the literature concerning the Stokes operator related, e.g.
