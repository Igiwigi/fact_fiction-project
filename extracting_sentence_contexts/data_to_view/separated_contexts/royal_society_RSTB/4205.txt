Other Lepidostrobi in the same collection, similar to certain specimens also
described by Hooker,} were derived from the Whitestone in the same locality. The
Gubbin ironstone of Claycroft has also yielded specimens. The explanation of the lack of variety among these petrifactions is no doubt to be
sought for in the fact that the shale beds, which now contain the ironstones, were

laid down in a region bordered by forests, which consisted of an almost pure associa-

tion of ainda. as also appears to have been the case at Pouk Hill, near Walsall. T have, unfortunately, not discovered any examples of the other type of petrifaction
which is only known, as far as South Staffordshire is concerned, in the case of
Cordaites Brandlingi (With.){ This no doubt was a petrifaction of the isolated
log type, and was derived from Rowléy Regis ; but the exact locality and horizon are
unfortunately not recorded. Impressions in Clay-ironstone Nodules.—Speaking generally, plant remains are not
well distributed in the ironstones of South Staffordshire.
