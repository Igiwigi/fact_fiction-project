Nothing tors in the A site precludes the quality control machinery

aa-tRNAs become more available. In these examples, the In TnaC, SecM and other known stalling peptides, proline
mRNA sequence has evolved to encode more information poses a challenge to the ribosome; Pro is both a poor peptidyl

The concentration of aa-tRNAs is not the only factor that acceptor (i.e. Pro-tRNA in the A site reacting with the nascent

tide itself also plays a role.
