the star c may continue to oscillate between c and d, in a straight
line, passing from c, through the centre o, to d, and back again
to c.

In order to see the possibility and permanency of this con-
nection the better, let o be the centre of gravity of the three
bodies, when the oscillating body is at c; then, supposing the
bodies a and b to be at that moment in the plane þ 1, and ad-
mitting m to represent a body equal in mass to the two bodies
a b, 0 will be the common centre of gravity of m and c. Then,
by the force of attraction, the body c and the fictitious body m
will meet in 0; that is to say, the plane þ /, of the bodies a 6,
will now be at p' /. The fictitious body m may then be con-
ceived to move on till it comes to x, while the body c goes to
d; or, which is the same, the plane of the bodies a b will now
be in the position p” /”, as much beyond the centre of gravity o,
as it was on the opposite side m. ' By this time, both the ficti-
tious body m, now at 7, and the real body c, now at d, have lost

their common centre of gravity o, in which they will meet a
second time. It is evident that the orbit of the two-large stars
