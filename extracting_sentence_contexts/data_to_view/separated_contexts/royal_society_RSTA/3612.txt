Ultimately, the result of hydrogen isotope measurements (made by the Rosetta
Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA); see [6]) was something of a
surprise. This suggested that the D/H ratio of 67P was a factor of approximately three times that
of the terrestrial value, which seemed to confound a previously emerging view that Jupiter-family
comets (like 67P) should have the Earth-like values. In fact, for a number of reasons, it is beginning
to look like there is no obvious difference between the D/H values of water in Jupiter-family
comets and other Oort cloud comets. Rather, comets, in general, appear to have D/H values that
span a range of one to three times the terrestrial value, with the exact value being a reflection
of the distance from the Sun that the comet condensed [7]. The relevance for studies of the
origins of the inner planets is that, as things stand, the elevated D/H ratios in comets mean that
they could constitute only a relatively minor proportion of the water on these bodies, including
the Earth [8-10].
