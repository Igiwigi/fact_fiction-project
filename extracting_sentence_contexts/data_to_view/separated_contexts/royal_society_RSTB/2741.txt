and 121p, 180A, 221A, 241, 2424, 252, &e.) it was found that unfavourable conditions,
especially low temperature, acting during growth did reduce the Spharechinus
characters toa marked extent, and that where the contrary seemed to be the case,
the cause was almost certainly to be found in selective mortality. This showed that
the facts observed might certainly be due, at least partially, to the second hypothesis,
and this view is supported by other considerations. For if there is any reduction of
dominance caused by the treatment of the eggs, not only should there be a decrease
of the Spherechinus characters but also an increase in those of Strongylocentrotus,
viz. : in the clubs or the body-skeleton and in body-length.
