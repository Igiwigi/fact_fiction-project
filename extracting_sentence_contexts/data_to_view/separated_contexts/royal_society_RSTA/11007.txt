Bismuth (fig. 25, Plate 11) gave us most interesting results, as it possesses some
lines, such as y, which are curved so little that the velocities of the molecules giving
these lines is found to be larger than that observed in any other case except aluminium,
On the other hand, the line at 3793 (Â¢) indicates the smallest velocity measured. There are some special difficulties standing in the way of the measurement of the
bismuth lines, which made us hesitate some time before definitely asserting the
different curvature of the lines, but we think that our best photographs, one of which
is reproduced in fig. 25, leave no doubt on the question. One of the difficulties lies in
the fact that bismuth and mercury are the only metals in which the lines are repeated,
owing to the oscillatory discharges. When six jars are in circuit, the appearance is
that of fig. 26, and the lines become mixed and difficult to measure. Another difficulty
lies in the great difference in the sharpness of the lines even on the stationary film,
the lines which show a small curvature being much sharper.
