cellulose (BC), is secreted as NC directly. The biosynthesis of BC was described by Brown already
in 1886 [10].

While both cellulosic biomass-derived CNF and BC possess similar fibril diameters (less than
100 nm), the two types of NC differ in terms of purity and crystal structure. BC is pure cellulose
while CNF is usually a composite consisting of cellulose and hemicellulose [11] and residual
lignin. Crystallographically, CNF is cellulose-Ig dominant and BC is cellulose-I~ dominant [12].
Single NC fibrils were shown to possess tensile moduli of between 100 and 160 GPa based on
Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction experiments [13-16]. The tensile strength (c) of single
NC fibril was estimated to be 2-6GPa [17] based on the critical length of single NC fibrils
fragmented using high-intensity ultrasound. Thus, NC is often explored as reinforcement for
polymers [1,18-20]. The application of NC as reinforcement for polymers often requires the NC
to be used in the form of single nanofibrils. In fact, it has been shown that the reinforcement
efficiency can be explored effectively when NC is impregnated at a single fibre level [1]. However,
it is difficult to exploit the properties of single CNFs fully in composites. Thus, in order to
produce NC composites with promising and predictable mechanical properties, high-loading
fractions have to be realized [1]. This can effectively be achieved following a paper-based
laminated composite route [21-24]. Besides using nanopapers for two-dimensional reinforcement
in composites [25,26], NC in the form of dense fibre networks, e.g. cellulose nanopapers
[27], is also an important material for various advanced applications, including filtration
membranes [28-30], packaging [31] and substrates for flexible, printed electronics [32]. Thereby,
the ability to design [33], tailor and engineer the physical properties of nanopapers is of upmost
importance.

The mechanical properties of nanopapers can be controlled by controlling the porosity of
