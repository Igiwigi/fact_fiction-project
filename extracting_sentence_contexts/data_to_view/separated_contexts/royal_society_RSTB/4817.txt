HCl in 95 per cent. alcohol, and afterwards stained with aqueous methylene blue, which

sheath substance in A. rwmicis, as PETRI says they do in the case of Phylloxera quoted
above (p. 44). With Dreyfusia niisslini I also employed the methylene blue stain as used by
Davinson, and obtained good staining of the sheath, but I am unable to deduce from
this fact the presence of pectic substances, for the following reasons :â€”

(a) As a confirmatory test for Pectin and its compounds, I used Ruthenium red,
which is recommended by Motiscn* as one of the best tests for this purpose. My results showed that although I got good staining of the middle lamelle of
the cell walls, in no case did I detect any sign of staining in the numerous stylet-
sheaths present in the abnormal tissue.

(b) Methylene blue cannot be regarded as a distinctive stain for pectic compounds,
and its action on the sheath may be due either to the presence of some animal
product, perhaps of the nature of mucin, derived from the saliva, or, on the
other hand, to certain plant substances extracted from the cells,

(c) The dissolution of the stylet-sheaths as a result of the action of pancreatin,
indicates that pectic substances are either absent or only present in small
proportion. The penetration of the cell walls along the middle lamella by the stylet is probably
due to or aided by the action of a ferment contained in the saliva, while the
presence of a second ferment is assumed, its function being to attack the proteid cell
contents and by bringing them into solution to render them available as food for the
insect.
