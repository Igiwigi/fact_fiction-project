In most instances « and Þ were made of about 100 ohms' resistance, and though 8uch
large resistances were, it is true, out of proportion to those of the other branches of the
bridge, yet, as has been already observed, the arrangement proved of amply suthcient
delicacy, and moreover rendered it impossiþle that any slight variations of the resistances
of X and Y, which were each 042 ohm, and of the wire N N, arising from changes of
temperature, should cause any appreciable error ; indeed, one great advantage of this
method is that the galvanometer and the resistance-coils may be a hundred yards or
more from the rest of the © bridge ” without any chance of fluctuations of temperature
materially influencing the result, even when the most minute variations of electrical
conductivity are to be measured. The deflections of the galvanometer were read in the usual manner by means of the
image of a fine wire fixed vertically across one end of a small blackened tube, into the
other end of which was fitted a lens for focussing the image of the wire on to the mirror
of the galvanometer; and the end of the tube at which the wire was situated was
illuminated by a paraffin lamp, placed 80 that the edge of the flame was in front of the
wire, the reflected circle of light with the fine dark line across the centre being very

clearly defined on the scale, though the latter was at a distance of 6 feet from the
galvanometer.
