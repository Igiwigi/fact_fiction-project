The fact of the coincidence, whether
causal or fortuitous, does, however, emphasise the importance of eliminating slow changes
in the study of annual figures ; if slow changes had been ignored in carrying through
the correlational work, we should no doubt have arrived at greatly exaggerated estimates
of the harmful effect of rain. Higher correlations would have been obtained and the
results would have exhibited one more case of high but essentially unreliable correlations
in meteorological agriculture. Against the view that the depression in yields is an
indirect effect of a rainy period must be set the fact that in our diagrams the yield appears

have a similar effect in both series. Effect of Fallow.
