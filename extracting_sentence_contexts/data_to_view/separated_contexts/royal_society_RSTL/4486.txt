and, according to. the experiments in the preceding Table, it, appears, that the, resist-

law to that of oak, the resistance of the former being directly as the depth and-of the
latter as the square of the depth. Reasoning from these facts, it may be! interesting to

ternal pressure increases in the ratio of the squares of its thickness ; and, where great,
strength is required, it will be necessary, in the construction of vessels, to consider
the nature of the service and the required thickness of the planks. The same remarks will apply to vessels constructed of iron, computed from the
formula deduced from the experiments. In a table of experimental results by Mr.
