Prof. WEBSTER states that the constants from which (iii.) was derived were tested by measuring in the
open air the sound from a standard “phone” or sound generator at pitch 256, Agreements were
obtained to within less than one per cent. There are difficulties in the way of applying (iv.), as determined for small intensities, to convert the
larger readings (greater than 5 mm.) to pressure amplitudes, owing to the fact that in the latter case
noticeable eddies are set up in the neighbourhood of the resonator aperture. For this reason it would be
necessary to carry out a special series of experiments to determine the limits of error (if any) involved in
measuring very powerful fog-signal waves by means of the phonometer. As the pressure amplitudes in
