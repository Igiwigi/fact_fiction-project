Tube-feet white. ‘

E. esculentus 3 x E. acutus ¢ (Cf Plate 24, figs. 100 and 104, and Plate 25,
figs. 123—126)—

A number of these hybrids have survived and have attained considerable size by
the end of the first year. One example two years old measures more than 8 cm.
across the spines.

The one from which the following description has been taken is one of the smaller
individuals from last year’s crosses. It has been selected on account of its size, which
approaches more that of the other hybrids. This cross has always grown more
rapidly than any of the others, despite the fact that laboratory conditions must be
unfavourable to it on account of the deep-water habitat of both parent forms.

With regard to this individual urchin the following are the data pertaining to the

culture from which it was derived :—
