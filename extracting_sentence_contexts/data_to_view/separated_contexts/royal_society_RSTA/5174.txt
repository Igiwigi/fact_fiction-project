'= (G- 2c +2 (fg, h). In a steady motion the right-hand side of this equation would vanish; and the
conditions of steady motion are thus determined by the solution of the ordinary
potential equation for a uniaxial medium. The constants involved in the values of
J, g, h so determined are connected by the fact that at a boundary of the elastic
medium the rotation (f, g, 2) must be directed along the normal. It follows at onee
for example that for a spherical nucleus * the rotation is everywhere radial.
