Mr. GRovE appears to think that it arises from some vibration
in the metal of the contact breaker, which produces a fluctuation in the inducing
current ; he finds that it is not always visible in the light caused by a single discharge,
and that it is influenced by the nature of the metals between which the interruption
park occurs.” Dr. RoBIN80N, in a previous communication to the Royal Irisgh Aca-
demyf, considered that the fact of their being produced by a single discharge, shows
that they do not depend on the discontinuity of the current; and in a note to his paper
of December 1856, he adds, * as the rarefaction proceeds, the intensity of the spark at
the contact breaker decreases, and also we should suppose the vibration there, yet the
stratification becomes more decided; this seems against Mr. GRove's hypothesis.” When
the discharge from the terminals of RUnMKoRPy's coil is taken in the air or in vacuo from
thin platinum wires, the negative terminal becomes heated, and if the discharges are
continued it is fused; in the voltaic battery it is the positive terminal that is heated
by the discharge. Tn vacuo Dr.
