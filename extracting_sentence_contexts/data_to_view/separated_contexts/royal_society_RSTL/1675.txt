By directing a telescope to that part of the head where with
the naked eye I saw a luminous appearance not unlike a star;
I found that this spot, which perhaps some astronomers may
call a nucleus, was only the head of the comet ; but that within

its densest light there was an extremely small bright point,
entirely distinct from the surrounding glare. I examined this
point with my 90 feet, large 10 feet, common 10 feet, and
also with a 7 feet telescope ; and with every one of these in-
struments I ascertained the reality of its existence. At the very first sight of it, I judged it to be much smaller
than the little planetary disk in the head of the comet of the
year 1807; but as we are well assured that if any solidity
resembling that of the planets be contained in the comet, it
must be looked for in this bright point; I have called it the
planetary body ; in order to distinguish it from what to the
naked eye or in small telescopes appeared to be a nucleus,
but which in fact was this little body with its surrounding light
or head een together as one object,

With a new 10 feet mirror of extraordinary distinctness, I
examined the bright point every fine evening, and found that
although its contour was certainly not otherwise than round,
I could but very seldom perceive it definedly to be 0. As hitherto I had only used moderate magnifiers from 100
to 160, because they gave a considerable brightness to the
point, it occurred to me that higher powers might be required
to increase its apparent magnitude ; accordingly the 19th of
October, having prepared magnifiers of 169, 240, goo, 400,
and 600, I viewed the bright point successively with these
powers. With 169 it appeared to be about the size of a globule which
in the morning I had seen in the same telescope and with the
same magnifier, and which by geometrical calculation sub-
tended an angle of 1,99.
