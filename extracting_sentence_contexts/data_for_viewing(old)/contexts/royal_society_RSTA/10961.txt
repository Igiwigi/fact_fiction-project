Both of these writers rely on a Fourier analysis of the vibration

Their results have not been accepted generally ; as has been pointed out in the
course of the present paper, their procedure will have no physical meaning for the
single train of waves with which they deal.

But we have also seen that a vast aggregate of independent emissions of this form
will really give the result which Lommen suggests.

§ 55. The trains of waves emitted by the molecules of a gas cannot strictly be
represented by (x.). As a matter of fact, such a motion as (x.) will never be allowed
to go on indefinitely ; it will always be checked at a certain stage by a new collision.
Nevertheless, if the radiation is so rapid that the vibration of a molecule has generally
become insignificant before the next collision occurs, we shall not be making a
serious error by allowing (x.) to represent the train of waves. We will proceed to
investigate the effect on the assumption that the damping is so rapid as to allow this
procedure.

§ 56. Both Lommen and JaumANN make an erroneous application of Fourter’s
theorem. The analysis should be as follows :—
