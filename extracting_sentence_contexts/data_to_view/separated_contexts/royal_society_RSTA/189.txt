independent random buy/sell choices). Rather, the volatility has a cusp minimum
at a critical value of the ratio of the information dimension to the number
of agents a= D/N =2"/N, suggesting a phase transition at a. Furthermore,
1e system is ergodic for w >, non-ergodic for w <a,.'+ Another interesting
observation is that the behaviour is almost identical if the true history of the
ast m time steps is replaced by a purely fictitious ‘random’ history, provided
1at each agent acts as though that fictitious history were true and additionally
1at it spans the same information space. Collective behaviour is determined by
universal belief rather than truth! The MG can be studied by methods developed in the theory of spin glasses,
although it should be hastened to add that there are differences.
