STRUCTURE, FROM THE BASE OF THE WAVERLEY SHALE OF KENTUCKY. 347

which are only in slight contact with the wood have precisely the same mesarch
structure as the strands imbedded in the pith; those, however, which are partly
imbedded in the wood, may appear to be exarch, because the obvious primary xylem
is only present on the side towards the pith, while on the outer side the protoxylem
appears to abut directly on the radial series of the secondary wood (Plate 38, fig. 17,
outer bundle), Intermediate states also occur, and sometimes the primary nature of
the elements immediately outside the protoxylem is only indicated by their shutting
off the inner end of a medullary ray. The fact that the outer part of the mesarch
xylem-strand assumes in these cases the radial arrangement proper to the secondary
wood is of some general interest. It shows once more how, when cambial growth is
once established, primary centrifugal wood tends to become merged in the secondary,

_ so that it is here impossible to draw any sharp distinction between the two. We
may say with equal justice, either that the centrifugal primary xylem of the strand
is in this part replaced by secondary, or simply that it assumes a radial arrangement
of the elements.

The pith, in which the xylem-strands are imbedded, consists of rather large cells,
from 80 to 160 » in transverse diameter. They are usually quite short, shorter than
they are broad (Plate 31, Phot. 81). Occasionally longer cells may be found near the
