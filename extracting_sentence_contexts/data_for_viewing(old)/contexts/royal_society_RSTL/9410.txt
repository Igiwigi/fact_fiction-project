change in the length of year since the initial condition to which we traced back the
moon would probably be very small indeed, but it is impossible to make this assertion
poitively, because, as obgerved above, the solar effects must have again become gensible,
after passing through a period of insensibility.


AND ON THE REMOTE HISTORY OF THE KARTH. 5183

$20. Terms of the second order in the fide-generating potential.

The whole of the previous investigation has been conducted on the hypothesis that
the tide-generating potential, estimated per unit volume of the earth's mass, is
wr (cos? PM—Z),* but in fact this expression is only the first term of an infinite
Series. I ghall now show what kind of quantities have been neglected by this treat-
ment. According to the ordinary theory, the next term of the tide-generating
potential is

m{r\3
Ve=ul(7) & cos PM—Z3 cos PM)
Although for my own satisfaction I have completely developed the influence of this
term in a similar way to that exhibited at the beginning of this paper, yet it does not
Seem worth while to give 80 long a piece of algebra ; and I shall here confine myself to
the consideration of the terms which will arise in the tidal friction from this term in
the potential, when the obliquity is neglected. A comparison of the result with the
value of the tidal friction, as already obtained, will afford the requisite information as
