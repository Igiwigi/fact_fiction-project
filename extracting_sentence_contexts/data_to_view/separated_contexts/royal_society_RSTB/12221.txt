Changes in performance seen during the acquisition of such skills
are known to be incremental, implicit in nature, long lasting and dependent
upon anatomical and functional plasticity within motor-related brain struc-
tures, including the striatum, cerebellum, motor-related cortical regions, as
well as the hippocampus (e.g. [5-8]). Yet, following the initial acquisition
phase, the newly learned information is then thought to be processed and reac-
tivated offline, such that initially labile memory traces become fixed into the
physical structure of the brain through a cascade of events occurring at both
the synaptic/cellular and the brain systems levels; a process called ‘memory
consolidation’ [9,10]. In fact, studies using MSL paradigms have repeatedly
shown that the procedural memory consolidation process of motor skill rep-
resentations is primarily observed hours or days after the first training
session, although Cohen ef al. [11] have recently reported that the same offline
