Now a magnet displaced ib as a whole without
splaying out (Plate 28, fig. 23). This, then, pointed to a variation in the relative strengt
of the interfering stream and the stream interfered with, and such variation mus |
occurred during the period that they were encountering one another, and were m0
in the ordinary way of such streams, for it showed itself in a variation in the extent
which the streams from the negative terminal were diverted. We may hence conelu
that the time requisite for the molecules to move the length of the tube was decide
less than that occupied by the discharge, but was sufficiently comparable with it to
the diminution of intensity of the streams from the side of the tube to make it
visible before the streams from the negative terminal experienced a similar dimin ti

Thus far we have only been dealing with positive relief But the phenomens
negative-special are equally important in the demonstration of the truth of this theor
In that case we know that the impulses that cause discharge arrive at the negaW
terminal of the tube and at the tinfoil synchronously, for the difference (if any) in
time required to pass from the machine along the wires to the two Places is ineo
parably smaller than any of the quantities with which we have to deal.* And yet

the most splendid virtual shadows. Now the discharge from beneath the
infoil will certainly not lasb longer than that from the effective negative terminal of
the tube, and yeb we find that the negative discharge from beneath the tinfoil and its
accompanying molecular streams are still in full vigour when the molecular streams
the negative terminal arrive at that part of the tube where they are situated, for
