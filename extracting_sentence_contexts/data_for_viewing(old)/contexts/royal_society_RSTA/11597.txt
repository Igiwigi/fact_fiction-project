This disturbing want of symmetry entirely disappears, however, when we employ a
rough sphere, as in Series VIII. and LX, (Plate 8). In Series VIII. the impinging
sphere was of marble 1°5 centims. in diameter, and the height of fall was 15 centims.
The sphere was on each occasion dried and then well rubbed with emery paper.
When dipped into the liquid it was at once “ wetted” in the usual sense of the
term. Yet the liquid on impact. seems to do anything but wet it. The first flow is
evidently very much along the surface away from the place of impact, and the
subsequent behaviour of the crater, as far as Photograph No. 14, is very similar to
that of Series I., which was due to the impact of a liquid sphere. Indeed,
figs. 8 to 10 of this series hardly differ from Nos. 17-20 of Series I. In the column
that afterwards emerges there is, however, a very wide difference. In each case it
rises. from the bottom of a hollow, but in the present: series it is a far finer jet and
moving with much greater velocity. This jet was, in fact, observed with® the naked
eye, in continuous daylight, to rise even to a greater height than that from which
the sphere had fallen.

Comparing the crater of this. series with that of Series I., we observe that while
the outside dimensions are not very different, the crater of the present series is
distinctly thinner in the wall, also that the number of lobes or arms is larger. The
number seems always to be decided at a very early stage, and to be due, as was
suggested (WorTHINGTON, ‘ Proc. Roy. Soc.,’ 1882, loc. cit.), to the instability of the
annular rim. Thus, in Series I., fourteen appears to be a frequently recurring number
in the earlier stages, and in Series VILL, twenty-six or twenty-eight, and in both
