Then to leading order we have Vzz ~ 0 so that V is a constant: V ~ vg. Then to leading order, U
satisfies U ~ w/vo where w is the ground state satisfying

Wz -w+w*=0. (2.4)

with a well-known explicit solution given by w(z) = 3 sech?(z/2). It remains to determine vg. To
do so, we integrate the second equation in (2.1) which yields

where we used the fact that io w?(z) dz =6. In conclusion, we obtained

3. Stability: large eigenvalues
We linearize the stripe using
u(x, y, t) = u(x) + e* eb (x)
and v(x, y, t) = v(x) +e! el” h(x),
which results in the following one-dimensional eigenvalue problem,
