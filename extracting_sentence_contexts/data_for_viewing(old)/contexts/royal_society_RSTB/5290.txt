‘fine’ vessels and arteries were compared. In an arterial injection the skeletal muscles
were strongly tinged by the colouring matter in the finer branches and capillaries,
but not at all by injection introduced into the “ fine *’ vessels. Conversely the mucous
membranes of the mouth and pharynx and the skin were but little coloured by an
arterial injection, though deeply tinted by the injection mass within the “ fine vessels.’

Cleared specimens show even more definitely that whereas the blood vessels form rich
capillary plexuses within the skeletal muscles, the “ fine ’’ vessels do not, but only pass
through them here and there, as relatively large trunks, to form capillary plexuses else-
where, particularly in the connective tissues underlying exposed surfaces such as the
skin and the mucous membranes of the mouth and pharynx.

The interest of this difference in distribution lies in the fact that a want of penetration
into the skeletal muscles is one of the characteristics of the lymphatic system of verte-
brates in general.* This suggests a relationship between the “ fine ” vessels and the
lymphatics, which is borne out (as detailed below) by other and more cogent considera-

tions. |

A similar peculiarity in distribution was observed in Lophius, but in this Fish, although
the system did not extend to the skeletal muscles or viscera, its distribution in the con-
nective tissues other than those underlying the skin and mucous membranes was far
more elaborate than in the Cod. In Lophius wherever the system extended the connec-
tive tissues around its trunks and larger branches were filled with an intricate network
of minor branches ; many of these were no doubt direct feeders of the surface capillary
