in addition to the one just discussed, is the concentric nature of the foliar strands.
There are now recorded a number of striking examples of conservatism in the foliar
strands of vascular plants, and it seems reasonable, especially in view of the facts

described in the foregoing paragraphs, to regard the concentric structure of the leaf-
traces of the Osmundaceve as an ancestral feature which has been lost in the cauline
fibro-vascular system. This view is further supported by the mesarch structure of the
tracheary bundles of the stem.

If the interpretation of the facts described in the foregoing paragraphs is correct,
the view of Zenerrr that the type of cauline central cylinder in O. regalis is
primitive and leads (Zeverri, â€˜Leitungs-System von O. regalis, p. 75) on one hand
to the so-called polystelic central cylinder so prevalent among the Filicales, and on
the other hand to that of the Lepidodendrids and Sigillarians, cannot be entertained.
That the Lycopodineous series has no near relationship to the Osmundacez seems
apparent on various grounds, which can be more conveniently discussed at a later
phase. The consideration of the anatomy of the whole group seems to establish that
instead of being more primitive than, and antecedent to, the fern-type with the
so-called polystelic central cylinder, they are merely a specialised condition of the
latter. The resemblance to the condition which Zener finds in the young axis of
the polystelic ferns is only an apparent one and arises from the degeneracy and
specialisation of the stelar system of the Osmundacez.
