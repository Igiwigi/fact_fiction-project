The lithistid sponges are princi-
pally represented by spicules belonging to the megamorina family. These are very
numerous and very generally distributed. The skeletal spicules of the other families
of lithistids are less common, and their generally minute dimensions may partly
account for this fact. There is, however, a great number of the dermal spicules of
lithistid sponges, which most probably belong to the tetracladina family. These
dermal spicules are but seldom preserved on the surface of the entire lithistid
sponges which have been discovered in the greensand, but they are present, quite
detached from each other, in the sponge-beds, in a great variety of forms.
