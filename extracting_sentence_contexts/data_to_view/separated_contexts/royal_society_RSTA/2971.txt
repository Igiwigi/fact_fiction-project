The two relevant configurations
for superfluid He are shown in figure 8a. Suppression of the transverse component Az-(z) =
A(z) at a pair-breaking surface can be mapped onto a domain wall in infinite space where this
component changes sign A) (z = +00) Aog- This domain wall configuration, which we may
call type-z, should be compared with another configuration, type-x, when the Az, component of
the OP changes along the plane of a (very thick, we can imagine) film. This latter configuration
costs less in terms of the free energy, see figure 8b and is, in fact, the lowest energy domain
wall configuration [63]. Although such states are not topologically stable in the bulk [63,64], the
confinement creates an environment where such configurations can appear to minimize the total
energy ina finite volume. The spectrum of the bound states reflects this interplay, and for the two
shown domain wall configurations is presented in figure 2.
