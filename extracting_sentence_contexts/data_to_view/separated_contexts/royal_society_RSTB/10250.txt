In addition to
the Chinese crested, the Xolo and Peruvian Hairless Dog
carry the same mutation [35]. The lack of homozygotes in
either breed suggests that the mutation is embryonic lethal,
perhaps due to other functions of the gene. The fact that these hairless breeds all share the exact
mutation is not surprising despite their reportedly diverse
origins. As a dominant trait the novel hairless phenotype
would have been easy to perpetuate in any breed in which
it was crossed. There is little verified history of the breeds
independently, as both the Chinese and the South American
dogs have been reported to be in the Americas prior to Euro-
pean colonization [36].
