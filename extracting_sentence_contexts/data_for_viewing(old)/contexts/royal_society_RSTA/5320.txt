0.3 wm, with all other mass and dimensional measurements perfectly accurate.

4. Formal analysis framework

(a) The pendulum’s equation of motion

Define @ and 6 to be, respectively, the angular position and velocity of the pendulum relative to its
equilibrium position. Torques that act on our pendulum as it rotates, in addition to that produced
by our source mass, have several origins.

1. Nonlinear elastic torques associated with the fibre, which we may approximate with a
Taylor series expansion: t = —(k10 + kz? + k305). Symmetry suggests that ky should be
zero, but in fact we have found significant non-zero values for this term in our tests.
Fortunately, ky proves to have negligible effect on our results. k3 however does have a
marginally significant effect.

2. Dissipative fibre torques. As discussed in §1, these clearly seem to have two distinct
contributions, one from the linear model discussed by Kuroda [1] and Quinn et al. [2],
which has a very significant effect on the G measurement, and also a contribution from
a stick-slip mechanism of unknown origin which produces a torque term —kss[(A? —
62)6 — 2A0].

3. Dissipative torques owing to magnetically induced eddy currents and residual gas
damping. These are negligible compared with internal fibre dissipative torque, as the
pendulum is non-conductive fused silica while the cryogenic environment together with
