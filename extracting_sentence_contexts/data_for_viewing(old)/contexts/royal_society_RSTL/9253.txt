(B) Nervous connexions between the Tentacles of Sarsia, —When one of the four ten-
tacles of Sarsia is very gently irritated, it alone contracts. Tf the irritation be Slightly
stronger, all the four tentacles, and likewise the polypite, contract. Tf one of the four
tentacles be irritated still more strongly, the bell responds with one or more locomotor
contractions. Tf in the latter case the stimulus be not too strong, or, better still, if the
Specimen operated on be in a non-yigorous or in a partly anzsthesiated state, it may be
observed that a short interval elapses between the response of the tentacles and that of
the bell. Lastly, the polypite is much more sensitive to a stimulus applied to a tentacle,
or to one of the marginal bodies, than it is to a stimulus applied at any other part of
the nectocalyx*.

These facts clearly point to the inference that nervous connexions unite the tentacles
with one another and also with the polypite—or, perhaps more precisely, that each
marginal body acts as a coordinating centre between nerves proceeding from it in four
directions, viz. to the attached tentacle, to the margin on either side, and to the poly-
pite. This, it will be observyed, is the distribution which TArcktL describes as occurring
in Geryonia, and SCHULTZ as occurring in Sarsiaf. It is further the distribution to
which my explorations by stimulus of last year would certainly point. But, in order to
tes the matter still more thoroughly, I tried the effects of section in destroying the

direction, which is to be immediately considered in the text (B). And as it seems probable that in snch a 8imple
case as this the same nerves would serve to convey impressions in both directions, perhaps the most judicious
view to take of the difference between the degree of sensitiveness displayed by the polypite when a tentacle is
injured, and that displayed by the tentacles when the polypite is injured, is to suppose that in the former case a
