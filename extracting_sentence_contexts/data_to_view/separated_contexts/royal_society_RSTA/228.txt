The trouble with making use of the concept of Kolmogorov complexity in
any application is that it is not a computable quantity; given a set of data, one
cannot, in general, obtain its Kolmogorov complexity. One cannot compute the
information content of a given sequence because it is not possible, in general, to
go backwards from the sequence to the algorithm that produced it. The nature
of the problem, which is a version of the Berry paradox, and is linked to Gédel’s
incompleteness theorem [73,74], becomes clear when one reasons that a sequence
of 100 digits may appear totally random—and so possess maximum Kolmogorov
complexity—but in fact be 100 consecutive digits taken from, say, 7, and so
possess considerably less complexity. Phil. Trans.
