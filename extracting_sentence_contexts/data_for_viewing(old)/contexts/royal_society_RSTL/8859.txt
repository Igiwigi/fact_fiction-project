guishing the connective-tissue cells from the nerve-rudiment. I believe that in this
embryo the origin of the nerves from the neural canal was a continuous one, though
naturally the peripheral ends of the nerve-rudiments were separate from each other.

The most interesting feature of the stage is the commencing formation of the anterior
roots. Each of these arises (Plate 16. fig. Da, ar) as a small but distinet outgrowth from
the epiblast of the spinal cord, near the ventral corner of which it appears as a conical

& projection. Even from the very first it has an indistinct form of termination and a
S fibrous appearance, while the protoplasm of which it is composed becomes very
© attenuated towards its termination.
E The points of origin of the anterior roots from the spinal cords are separated from
S each other by considerable intervals. In this fact, and also in the nerves of the two
© sides never being united with each other in the ventral median line, the anterior roots
2 exhibit a marked contrast to the posterior.
S "There exists, then, in Torpedo-embryos by the end of this stage distinct rudiments of
= both the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves. 'These rudiments are at first
2 quite independent of and disconnected with each other, and both take their rise as
Soutgrowths of the epiblast of the neural canal.

S rudiments are elongated, pear-shaped bodies of considerable size, and, growing in a
S\entral direction, have reached a point nearly opposite the base of the neural canal.
