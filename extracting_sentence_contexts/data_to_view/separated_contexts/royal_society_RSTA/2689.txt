that Reanautr’s temperature scale over this range did
not differ materially from that given by formula (1). It is certain, however, that
ReGNAvuLT was ignorant of the phenomenon of the temporary depression of zero of a
mercury thermometer when heated, and that he was unable to detect any systematic

difference between the mercury and gas scales of temperature over the range 0° C. to
100° C., both of which facts would appreciably affect the reduction of the readings of
the thermometers employed for observing the rise of temperature in the calorimeter. The correction for these two sources of error combined might reduce Reenaut’s
values by 5 or 6 parts in 1,000 if the thermometers he employed were of French
“eristal” glass. In any case the reduction could hardly be less than 2 or 3 parts in
1,000.
