These facts may be taken as representative stages in a morphological series,
and the similarity of development in the four genera would support that idea. Moreover, as we shall see, the fossils provide other examples which amplify the
series. As in other morphological series, however, the facts may be taken as illus-
trating either of two views; in this case either a progression from a coherent toa
separate condition of the sporangia, or a progressive fusion of them. This question
will be considered again later, when the fossils have also been brought into the
comparison. The existence of a specialised mechanism for dehiscence of the individual
sporangium appears to run parallel with the separate projection of the individual
sporangia.
