among various non-migrant solitaria or congregans populations of the same species observed
by the writer (1939), appeared to decrease after the insects had come down to the ground in
the morning, increased again as the morning basking period progressed, and then decreased
still further when ‘basking-places’ became so hot that the insects retired to the shade. On
cloudy, winter days when the screen maximum did not reach 30° C the period of basking
and wandering freely continued right through the day. On cloudless, spring days when the
maximum exceeded 30° C such activity gave way to almost complete inactivity during the
hot midday hours—except for occasional individuals which emerged on to open ground and
became at once violently active until they regained the shade. Similarly, the activity of
a number of species of non-swarming Acrididae on a sand-dune in Palestine (Bodenheimer
1935) decreased steadily after reaching a maximum when the soil surface temperature was
about 35° C. In consequence, diurnal activity showed a single, midday maximum in spring
and autumn, but two maxima separated by a midday lull in summer. This fact is familiar
to collectors, and was justly emphasized by Rao (1942) in connexion with the estimation of
locust populations in the field.

The difference between migrant and non-migrant locusts, therefore, is not that migrants
are provoked into mass movement by excessive temperatures which non-migrants somehow
escape. Both are most active over a period (that is ‘spontaneously’ active, apart from
immediate reactions to more or less sudden temperature changes) at temperatures that are
