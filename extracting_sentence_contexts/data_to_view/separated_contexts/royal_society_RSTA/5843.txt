A detailed
discussion is deferred to the subsequent section. As stated above, they are slightly stronger
than hypothesis 2.3 required in the proof, but may be more convenient to verify numerically or in
experiment. In fact, there has already been direct evidence of the behaviour (1.10) with a ~ 0.03


from experiment [38-40] (see extended discussion in remark 2.5). In practice, (1.10) and (1.11)
need only be checked over the finite range of scales in the inertial range ¢, < ¢ « L. We prove
