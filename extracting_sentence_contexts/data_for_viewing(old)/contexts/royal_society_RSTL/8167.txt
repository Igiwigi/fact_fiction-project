Let I be a sphero-conic on a sphere Q, U a point on the surface of Q; from U draw
an arc UT perpendicular to any great circle tangential to F, and take two points, P, P',
such that

cos UT: cos 'TP=cos UT: cos 'TP'=k,
where + is a constant.

The locus of the points P, P' is a sphero-quartic.

Cor. Tf k=1 the point P coincides with U, and the point will in this case be a double
point in the sphero-quartic, and the sphero-quartic itself will be the inverse of a plane
conic from a point outside the plane of the conic. In fact if the sphere Q be inverted
into a plane from the point U, it is easy to see that the point P' will be inverted into a
point whose locus is a conic,

Lemma. If S$=2"+j*+2*+u*=0, A=ar+by+cz+dw=0, then the result of the
operation n+p 3+, £45 £ performed on the quadric $i—A is
wal (a +d+o0+d4)S'—(iwpy+z+o),

which is evidently connected with S'—A by the invariant relation (13) of art 9. Hence
we have the following theorem :—
