In particular, the impact of specific growth models upon
spontaneous oscillations is explored by setting the same initial length &9 = ¢g and overall linear
growth rate 1/tg, such that at any time the rods are equally long. We notice that for the linear
growth profile (example 3), spontaneous oscillations are delayed with respect to the other models
such that their amplitude is smaller. We argue that this derives from the fact that, for the linear
profile, the highest growth rate is at the rod’s tip, and hence the growth zone is effectively less
responsive than in the other cases, see equations (4.5). On the contrary, the other three models
(examples 1, 2, and 4) give rise to similar results, see figure 2a,b,d and electronic supplementary
material, videos 1, 2 and 4. We extend our analysis by comparing the periods of the spontaneous oscillations that we
observe numerically at different stages of growth.
