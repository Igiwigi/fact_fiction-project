the loss of function the probable paths of transmission of afferent or efferent
impulses, yet such a mode of experimentation is always open to very grave
disadvantages and sources of fallacy. Such, for example, is the always recurring
possibility of functional changes proceeding beyond the desired lesion, &c.

The accomplishment of this further purpose, viz., the localisation of both paths and
centres by ascertaining the excitatory electrical effects in relation with them, was one
of the main objects we had in view.

In carrying it out we found it was unnecessary to employ the electrometer, and,
in fact, that it was advantageous to use the galvanometer, the record of which could
be more easily and more accurately noted, since its graduation admits of far higher
magnification. Moreover, with this instrument it was possible, by employing a series
of stimuli, of known number and duration, to obtain quantitative results of definite
comparative value, as will be shown further on; and thus to compare the electrical
effects evoked (1) in different central paths by direct stimulation of these, and (2) in
any one path by excitation of different regions.

The plan upon which the present paper is framed is, first, to give a historical
retrospect of the work of authors who have opened up the study of electrical
changes in the central and peripheral nervous system ; second, to describe at length
our mode of experimentation, with special reference to the modifications which
we have introduced, then to compare roughly the results we have obtained by our
