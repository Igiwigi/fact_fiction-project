andit of course becomes of the negative variety ; but it is speedily rendered positive,
or the lights and shades corrected, by the hyposulphite of soda. We have it thus in
our power to produce upon the same sheet two very marked varieties of photographic
drawings.

PosTSCRIPT.

(a.) I find the invisible photographic image, on the papers prepared by sulphura-
tion, becomes evident without the aid of mercurial vapour, by simply soaking for
some time in a s0lution of corrosive sublimate. The picture thus formed is extremely
faint, but the fact is worthy of notice, as it may ultimately lead to the discovery of a
process, by which the disengagement of the light-created picture may be effected by
more simple means than at present.

(b.) If papers saturated with starch prior to being washed with the salt of silyer
and exposure to the sulphuretted hydrogen gas, the silyer being applied on one side
only, be, when completed, placed between the leaves of a printed book and subjected
to 8ome little pressure, the printing is faithfully copied off on the wnsilvered 8ide. It
is with difficulty the letters can be made out when the paper is taken from the yo-
lame, but by immersing it in a solution of iodine they become a deep blue, verging
on a black, whilst the ground remains of a yellow colour, which by the continued
action of the fluid changes to a light violet. On drying, the ground becomes con-
siderably darker, and the printing, though evident, indistinet, appearing in s0me posi-
