Luminous 8timulation of the covered-eyed Meduse.—Tn my previous papers
T have detailed the results of various experiments on the laminous stimulation of the
naked-eyed Mednsz. Since the publication of these papers T have tried whether the
covered-eyed Medusex are likewise susceptible to this mode of stimulation, and T have
found that, although the results are not of 80 marked a character as they are in the
case of the naked-eyed Meduse, nevertheless, by a little care, it does admit of being
proved that the lithoeysts of the covered-eyed Medusz resemble the marginal bodies
of the naked-eyed Medusz in being rudimentary organs of vision. The best way that I have found of proving this fact is to divide an Aurelia into
segments, leaving one or more lithocysts in each segment. On then choosing a
segment, which is nob very active, and leaving it for some time in the dark, it may be
observed, on approaching it with a candle, that its activity is much legs pronounced
than it was in the daylight. But after the candle has been allowed to shine upon it
for a few seconds, the segment begins to become gradually aroused into a state of
greater activity.
