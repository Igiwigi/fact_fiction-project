Pres. R.S.

Read June 19, 1825. Is these papers I endeavour, to the utmost of my power, to
distinguish between the facts which I am able to substantiate, *
and the hypothesis by which I have: been. directed in my
inquiries. I hope that the importance of the facts may give
some bias in favour of that mode of reasoning by which they
have been discovered, and an additional interest to anatomical
studies.
