This would be in general agreement with the facts
derived from the microscopic appearances of the cell-walls of wood after failure in
compression, in tension and in shearing in a longitudinal direction respectively. It
has already been pointed out, however, that the conception of crystalline micelle as
the ultimate particles of cell-wall substance is not in accord with many modern views
regarding the structure of colloid gels (p. 71). Neither is the micellar conception
necessary to explain the facts described above for wood. It seems to me that a
mechanical hypothesis of the structure and properties of the colloidal cell-wall
explains all the known facts. The salient points of the alternative hypothesis of cell-wall structure, which I have
been led to propose from this study of the minute mechanical properties of the
cell-walls of wood, will now be outlined.
