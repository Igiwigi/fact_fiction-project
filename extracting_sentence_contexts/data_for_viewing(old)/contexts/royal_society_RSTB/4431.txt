such cones, and, though several suggestions have been made that B. Gibsonianus,
the famous type, may have been bisporangiate when young, they are based on
theoretic deductions, for, in the ovulate cones, which are all we have of the species,
no trace of male organs remains. The bisporangiate cones just described are not only
the first found in this country, but they are younger, and in an earlier stage of
development than any others described. They are of peculiar interest, therefore, as
revealing something of the developmental stages of the most intriguing of all fossil
fructifications.

B. maximus and B. Gibsonianus being from the same restricted locality and
geological horizon, being known only from a single specimen each, and being in such
different stages of development, it might be concluded by someone not working on
them that they are really the same species. I must emphasise, therefore, the fact
that CARRUTHERS undoubtedly was correctly inspired when he, without any
examination of the internal parts, diagnosed B. maximus as different from
B. Gibsonianus. The vegetative characters, particularly the absence of gum canals
and the presence of the peculiar “ transfusion” cells, isolates B. maaimus vegetatively
further from B, Gibsonianus than any of the other species of the genus, in all of
which gum canals are common.

A detailed comparison of the fruits of these two Lower Greensand species would be
very interesting, but, unfortunately, they are too different in age for this to be
possible. One can compare with advantage, however, the general proportions of the
parts of the cones in these different phases of their development, and to do that
T have attempted to give a restoration of the new cone-structures.
