A few experiments were also carried out with films on both the top and bottom
surfaces. In general the results showed that for a given number of films on the lower
surface the friction and wear throughout the experiment were independent of the
thickness of film on the upper surface. In fact the results were the same as those
obtained with no films at all on the upper slider. Since the film at the point of contact
on the upper surface is always worn away rapidly during the very first run, this
result is to be expected. Cholesterol films

The experiments were repeated with cholesterol films, and the results obtained are
shown in figures 15 (plate 5), 16 and 17 (plate 5).
