These were associated with high tensile reaction forces in the gallery posts of 223.5 and 250.7 KN,
respectively, large enough to damage bolts at the base of the helideck and the encastrated bars. Finally, strain associated with these tensile stresses, although showing a significant increase from :3
2017 to 2067 conditions, is still only 12% of the assumed plastic strain capacity. : =
Trinity House depends on these lighthouse helidecks for the same reason they were :R

from the structural modelling is important as it will inform Trinity Houseâ€™s visual inspection
surveys. This will provide operational confidence for the lighthouse authorities into the future.
