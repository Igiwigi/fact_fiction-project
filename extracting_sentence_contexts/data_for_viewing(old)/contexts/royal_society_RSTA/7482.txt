Note. For the Hg alloys the compositions in brackets are the nominal ones; the second figure gives the com-
position as determined by chemical analysis. For the indium alloys only the nominal concentration (probably
close to the truth) is given. The values of R/R, in brackets were not determined directly, but obtained by
interpolation of the relation between R/R, and concentration. The values of a have been adjusted to give
amplitudes (as defined in table 4) at 1-5°K; most of them were in fact measured close to this temperature,
but Sn9 was measured at 1-78°K and Sn 18 at 1-15°K.

For the other metals for which x was determined (gallium, mercury, antimony and
graphite) the determination was made only for the pure metals, and for gallium and
mercury as well as tin it is fairly clear that x is too large to be accounted for by collision
broadening alone. Thus the values of x for pure tin, gallium and mercury are all about 1° K,
which according to equation (6) would imply a collision time of about 2 « 10~!2s, while
the resistivities at low temperatures* indicate collision times of order 107!°s if equation
(24) is used and one electron of normal mass per atom is assumed. This assumption may well
