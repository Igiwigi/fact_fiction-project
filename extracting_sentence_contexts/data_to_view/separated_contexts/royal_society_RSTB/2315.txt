The absorption by the 2 normal solution is nearly the same as that of normal,
but any further increase in concentration results in a diminution in the absorption. There is also a marked falling off in the absorbing capacities of solution of } and 4
normal,

The apparatus we have just described is well adapted to show how the coeflicient
of absorption of a caustic soda solution varies directly with the tension of the carbon
dioxide in the moving air current. It may in fact be used for actually determining
the amount of CO, in the air without any necessity for measuring the volume passing
through the apparatus. All that it is necessary to do is, with fixed conditions of
concentration of the solution and temperature, to ensure a very rapid stream of air

the duration of the experiment. The increase in the amount of CO, in the liquid:
