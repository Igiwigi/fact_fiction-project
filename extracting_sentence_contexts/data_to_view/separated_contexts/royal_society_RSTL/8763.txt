There is thus in this particular a direct contradiction between the results of Dr.
Enr's experiments and those of my own. I should therefore like to state that my
experiments with reference to this subject were not made till near the end of the
season, and $0 at a time when the only specimens I could procure were small and not
very active. In view of this fact I intended to defer publishing any account of the
experiments now detailed until I had an opportunity of confirming them on vigorous
Specimens; but a perusal of Dr. Erun's statements appears to render it desirable for
me to give an opinion now upon the point under consideration, although I confess
that, for the reason just mentioned, I do 80 with some diffidence. I fully agree with Dr. Een in his view that the contractions of Aurelia aurita are
« uxnally involuntary,” but that they are nevertheless to a certain extent subject to
the control of volition. As stated in the beginning of this paper, I believe that
different species of Medusz are endowed in different degrees with the power of
volition ; and in this respect I should place Aurelia aurita at the head of all the covered-
eyed species T have observed : its contractions are not of s0 purely 7hythmical a nature
as are those of Cyancea capillata, &c.
