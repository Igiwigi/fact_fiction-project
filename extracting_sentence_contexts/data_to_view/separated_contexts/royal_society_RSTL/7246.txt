The reason of this he seeks in the same cireumstances, which
in his view prevent a closer agreement in the atomic weights of the elements (com-
pare & 92). Differences of this kind, and even still more considerable, occur in the atomic heats
of compounds for which greater agreement in these numbers might be expected—of
8uch compounds,”that is, as contain elements of the same, or almost the same atomic heat
combined with the same other element in the same atomic proportion. To this belongs
the fact that the atomic heat has been fonnd s0 different ($ 85) for the isxomorphous com-
pounds, magnetic iron ore (37-7), chrome iron ore (31:2), and spinelle (27-7), and for
alumina (21-3) and for sesquioxide of iron (26:8). In the atomic heats of 8uch analogous
compounds there are differences for which, or rather for the magnitude of which, as
furnished by our present. observations, I know at present no adequate explanation.
