226 SIR ROBERT HADFIELD: A RESEARCH ON

it seems that the analysis of Wootz may have been undertaken with a view to obtaining
data for its imitation, and certainly one of the earliest successes reported in the paper
presented to the Royal Institution in 1820 is the preparation of a specimen which
“had all the appreciable characters of the best Bombay Wootz.”

Whether Wootz was the means of attracting Farapay to the field of steel alloys,
or whether he drew his inspiration from the interesting minute adopted by the Managers
of the Royal Institution in 1812 to the effect that it was desirable that experiments
should be undertaken with the alloys of metals, the fact remains that he was definitely
interested in the preparation of this material by alloying, and he repeatedly compared
his other steel alloys with Wootz, thus taking the latter as, in some measure, a
standard of reference.

As to the manner in which Farapay conducted his metallurgical work, including the
preparation of his alloys, much information can be obtained from his famous and most
valuable book, “ Chemical Manipulation,” a model of its kind, in which there are given
clear and detailed descriptions of the construction and use of the “ blast furnace,” as
Farapay termed it, in which the steel was melted, and the crucibles he employed.
This furnace is fully described in paragraph No. 184 of the book mentioned, and is
shown in fig. 3. The laboratory in which the furnace was placed, situated in the
