This lower limit of temperature is
the same with all mixtures.”

From his latest experiments (nob yet published) HorsTMANN concludes that the
values of the coefficient, which by the earlier experiments fell between 4 and 7, may
be much lower at low temperatures: for the lowest temperatures even less than 1. This shows that, contrary to what is found ab high temperatures, the affinity of
oxygen for carbonic oxide at Jow temperatures is greater than for hydrogen ; a resulb
which confirms the statement of E. von Meyer that in the slow combustion effected
by platinum at ordinary temperatures more carbonic oxide is burnt than hydrogen. I shall show later that the proportionality discovered by HoRsTMANYN between the
ratios of the unburnt gases and the products of combustion is a fact independent of
the percentage of combustible gases burnt, and dependent only on the conditions (1)
that a sufficiently high temperature should be reached in the explosion, (2) that none
of the reacting molecules should be withdrawn from the sphere of action during the
chemical change, and (3) that no indifferent gas should be present. Experiments with dry gases above the critical pressUure. To test the accuracy of HoRsTMANN's conclusions, the following experiments were
made with dry gases exploded at high pressures.
