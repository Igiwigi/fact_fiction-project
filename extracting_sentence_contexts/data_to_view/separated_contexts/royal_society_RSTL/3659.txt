The conclusion, as regards the iron, is undoubtedly correct; but I believe experi
ment proves that the mutual action of diamagnetic molecules, when caused to
approach each other, increases their repulsive action. I have had massive iron
moulds made and coated with copper by the voltaic current; into these fine bismuth
powder has been introduced and submitted to powerful hydraulic pressure. No sen-
Sible fact can, I think, be more certain, than that the particles of this dust are brought
into closer proximity along the line in which the pressure is exerted, and this is the
line of strongest diamagnetization. If a portion of the compressed mass be placed upon
the end of a torsion beam and the amount of repulsion measured, it will be found
that the repulsion is a maximum when the line of magnetization coincides with the
line of compression ; or, in other words, with that line in which the particles are
packed most closely together: if the bismuth were fixed, and the magnet moveable,
the former would repel the latter with a maximum force with the line of compression
parallel to the direction of magnetization: it is a stronger diamagnet in this direction

than in any other. Cubes of bismuth, which, in virtue of their crystallization, pos-
sessed a line of minimum magnetization, have been placed in those moulds and
pressed closely together in the direction of the said line: the approximation of the
particles thus effected has converted the direction spoken of from one of minimum
into one of maximum magnetization, It would be difficult for me to say how many
diamagnetic bodies I have submitted to compression, some massive, some in a state
of powder, but in no single instance haye I discovered an exception to the law that
the line of compression of purely diamagnetic bodies is the line of strongest diamag-
netization.
