of more extensive 8ystems. Much ingenuity has been expended on the discovery of
systems, the addition of which to the particular system under consideration may assist
in its investigation. It is to this that the existence of such units as substitutions,
quarternions, quadrates, &c. (as to 8ome of which I shall have to speak presently), is
due. We shall see that we can always, by the addition of a proper system to any
given system, completely define the latter by merely indicating the mode of distri-
bution of certain pairs (secs. 81, 82).

34. Notwithstanding the great assistance derived from the use of added systems,
much reluctance is exhibited in employing them unless they can be shown to have
their representatives in nature, 2.e., unless © accidental” clothing can be found to fit
them. The objections raised to symbolical methods which cannot be © interpreted”
are strong evidence of the fact that the accidental nature of much that comes under
our consideration is not really appreciated.

25. Tt is by no means unnecessary to state that the form of a system is independent
of the particular method of defining it which we adopt ; and that, because it is easier to
define a s8ystem by adding fresh units, it does not owe its form to the existence of
those units,

36. The system which is the actual subject of investigation in an inquiry may be
termed the base system ; those systems which are added for the purpose of assisting
in the investigation being termed auziliary systems.
