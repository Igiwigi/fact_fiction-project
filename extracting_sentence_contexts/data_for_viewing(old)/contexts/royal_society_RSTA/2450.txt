Finally, it is also worth noting that successful delivery of fusion power will be dependent
on a supply of highly trained capable scientists and engineers. UKAEA has a strong training
programme at all levels, from apprentices, to graduates, to post-graduate students and post-
doctoral researchers.

4. Conclusion and future perspectives

Since 16 MW of fusion power was achieved in JET in 1997, the headline progress in fusion has
appeared to the outside world to slow down. This belies substantial technical progress and greatly
improved understanding of the science and technology in the field. However, it is representative


of the fact that fusion requires a burning plasma, where the fusion reaction provides products
which sustain the reaction, before fusion on a commercial basis can be considered possible. ITER
will provide that demonstration, and as such is critical to the success or failure of commercial
fusion power. UKAEA will continue to contribute significantly to ensure ITER reaches its goals,
in many technical and scientific areas and in providing expert advice to industry—many of ITER’s
needs can be satisfied by existing industrial capabilities.

However, while ITER will show fusion is possible, it will not provide net fusion electricity.
UKAEA’s evolving portfolio of facilities will help to address some of the challenges in the
transition to DEMO and power plants, but a concerted, multinational endeavour will be needed in
parallel with ITER to address them all appropriately. For instance, the MRF is an important facility
for testing and validating numerical models of small material samples irradiated by low-energy
(usually fission-spectrum) sources. However, only with samples exposed to a fusion-relevant
