It is from the misconception on this point that the error has arisen, that the
respiration is not absolutely suspended in hybernation. This function has been
80 readily excited, through the medium of an unimpaired sensibility, that the
event has been considered as appertaining to the state of hybernation. In fact, the sensibility is in nearly the same condition in hybernation as in
ordinary sleep. It must appear extraordinary that with an unimpaired sensibility there can
co-exist a suspended respiration. Why is not this snspension of respiration
painful in the hybernating, as in other animals?
