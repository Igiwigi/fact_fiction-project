ing the abstraction of the atmospheric air. This sleep probably passes into
true hybernation, as the blood which circulates through the brain becomes
more and more venous, from the diminution of the respiration, and as the mus-
cular fibre of the heart acquires increased irritability.

It is absolutely necessary, in comparing the powers of hybernating and
other animals, of eyolving heat, accurately to obserye whether there be any
degree of sleep. Mr. HunTer's and M. Epwarvs's experiments are extremely
deficient, for want of this attention. Mr. HuxTer, comparing the common
mouse and the dormouse exposed to a very low temperature, observes, that
the heat of the former © was diminished 16* at the diaphragm, and 18* in the
pelvis, while in the dormouse it gained five degrees, but lost upon a repetition.”
The explanation of these facts is afforded by noticing that when the dormonse
increased in temperature, it was © very lively,” but on the © repetition” it had
become * less lively*.” M. Epwarps omits to mention whether the hyber-
nating animals in his experiments were disposed to be lively or dormant, or
whether they had recently recovered from a dormant state. Without a pecu-
liar attention to this point, no correct result can be obtained. The hyber-
nating animal in a state of vigour and activity, is a totally different being
from the same animal disposed to become dormant.
