- This arrangement consists of a frog prepared after the usnal manner of Garyaxt, and:
then cut in half at the symphysis of the pelvis. If a continuous current is passed from
one limb to another for fifteen, twenty, or thirty seconds, according to the force of the
current, it is known that the opening of the circuit is accompanied by violent contractions
of the limb traversed by the inverse current. - These contractions depend, as IT showed
many years ago*, on a particular state of the nerve; and in fact the contractions are
obtained and continue when the circuit is interrupted by cutting the nerye near the spine,
but they are no longer produced if the nerye is cut near its insertion in the muscles of
the leg. | v My object in this memoir has.been to prove that the particular state of the nerve aboye
described consists of Secondary electromotor power, that is, in a well-known physical
phenomenon.
