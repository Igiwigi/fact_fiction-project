All the purifying arrangements were
placed close to the testing bulb and between it and the rest of the apparatus so
as to be as efficient as possible. After the nitrogen had been prepared, the copper in
the hot tube was always found to be quite bright except at the front end. The positive ionisation in nitrogen is small compared with that in oxygen, especially
at low pressures As we have seen, a small quantity of oxygen has a very big effect
on the positive leak, and it might therefore be supposed that the leaks observed in
nitrogen were due to traces of oxygen which had not been removed by the purifying
processes. â€˜This, however, is rendered improbable by the fact that the ionisation in
nitrogen differs in character in certain important respects from that in oxygen. The
current requires a greater electromotive force to saturate it under similar conditions,
and it also showed time changes, after altering the applied E.M.F., similar to those
observed in a new wire. These changes were never observed in a wire which had
been heated in oxygen for a long time.
