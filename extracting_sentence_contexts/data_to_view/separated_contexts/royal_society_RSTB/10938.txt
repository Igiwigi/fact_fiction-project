The size effect
refers to the fact that the discriminability of given numerical
difference depends on the size of the two discriminanda. Thus, for example, a difference of 2 is easily recognized
when the discriminanda are 4 and 2, but the same difference
is unrecognizable by the non-verbal system for representing
numerosity when the discriminanda are 52 and 50. The distance

effect refers to the fact that the discriminability of two numeros-
ities depends on how widely separated they are. We—and all
other vertebrate species tested—more readily discriminate 10
from five than we discriminate six from five. Both the size
effect and the distance effect are implied by Weber's Law.
