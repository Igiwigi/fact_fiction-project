Thus,
for instance, in the case of Aurelia, if the paralyzed umbrella be immersed in a solu-
tion of glycerine (10 to 20 per cent.) a few rhythmic pulsations of normal rate are
usually given, but shortly after these pulsations occur the tissne begins to go into a
tetanus, which progressively and rapidly becomes more and more pronounced until it
ends in violent tonic spasm. So that the history of events really regembles that of
Sarsia under similar cireumstances, except that the stage of artificial rhythm which
inaugurates the spasm is of a character comparatively less pronounced.

(m.) Thus far, then, I have detailed all the facts which I have been able to collect
with reference to the phenomena of artificial rhythm as produced by different kinds of
constant, stimulation. Tb will nob be forgotten that the interest attaching to these
facts arises from the bearing which they have on the theory of natural rhythm. My
