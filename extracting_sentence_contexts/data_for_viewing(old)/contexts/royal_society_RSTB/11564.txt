while preserving other types. Yet, when translating these find-
ings to develop treatments for psychological disorders,
relatively little attention has been paid to specifying what
type of memory (i) can be modified and (ii) should be modified.
We argue that rather than the traditional declarative versus non-
declarative memory system distinction, the clinical focus should
be on the intrusive nature of an aversive memory [68], which
could, in principle, stem from both systems. A clinical interven-
tion should thus seek to target the involuntary expressions of
the memory (both declarative and non-declarative), without


it intrusive memories of fragments knowledge of facts or trauma! 1
