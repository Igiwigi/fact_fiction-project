In photographs of the partial phases, therefore, the length of the wires
Aepicted corresponds with the extent of the crescent unobscured, and is shorter the nearer
Hhe picture is to the totality. A wire which is visible in some cases is afterwards covered
Sby the moon, 80 that the correct apposition of the picture could not be effected, in every
Einstance, by means of the same wire. In the totality-pictures the whole four wires are
Srixible, from the fact of one or other of them having intercepted either the light of the
Eprominenoes or that of the corona, the latter even having depicted itself sufficiently to
render the shadow of the wires quite perceptible. In the other phases, either wire IV. Eor wire II. was used for rectifying the picture; if wire II. were used, the circle was
Acdlamped to read 134" 54' 10”, because this had been found, by measurement, to be the
position which corresponded to 315® for wire TV.
