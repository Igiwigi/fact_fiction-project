more than one-and-a-half time as much was taken up; and the increase, which
amounted to an average of nearly 80 lbs. per acre per annum, was more than two-and-
a-half times as much as is accounted for by the increased amount of soda taken up,
due to the nitrate of soda uged. Tt is remarkable, too, that whilst the decline in the
amount of mineral matter taken up over the second period compared with the first was
13:5 per cent, without manure, and 35:3 per cent. with the ammonia-salts, it was only
9:1 per cent. with the nitrate of soda. Of individual mineral constituents, not
supplied in either manure, more lime, more magnesia, and considerably more of potass,
phosphoric acid, and silica, were removed in the produce by the nitrate than in that by
the ammonia-salts.

To attempt to explain these results, even as fully as the data at command will
allow, would be to go beyond the facts more special to this section, and to trench upon
those specially belonging to the botanical and chemical sections, and would, indeed,
involve a long discussion. It must suffice in this place briefly to indicate the main
points. Under the influence of the nitrate of soda a greater total number of species
maintained a place than under that of the ammonia-salts. Among the grasses a
greater variety contributed to the bulk of the herbage, and they showed a greater

tendeney to form stem and seed. There was also somewhat more leguminous herbage,
and considerably more referable to miscellaneous species, of which, moreover, a greater
number were fairly prominent.

Tt will be readily conceived that, under the "7 here described, there would
be a greater variety, and better development, and consequently a wider and deeper
