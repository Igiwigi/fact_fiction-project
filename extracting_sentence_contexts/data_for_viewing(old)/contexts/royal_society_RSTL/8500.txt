&, (3, y about the same screws I, M, N can neutralize each other; in other words, that
the last twist shall restore the body to the same poxsition which it occupied before the
first. The total quantity of energy expended in the three twists against a wrench F on
any screw $,, must be zero; hence the algebraical swm of the three quantities, «FA,,,
BZFB,,, yFC,,, must be zero, or

«A, +83B,+y0,=0.
We thus see that the quantities a, 3, s must be proportional to X, Y, Z, and that the
conditions to be fulfilled by L, M, N are precisely the same in both cases.

4. On the component wrenches about 8x 8crews of reference into which any wrench may
be resolved.—The properties of the virtual coefficient enable us to calculate with faci-
lity the magnitudes of seyen wrenches about seyen screws which equilibrate, or, in fact,
to resolve a wrench into six wrenches about six given screws* [art. 46].

Let A, &c., A, be the given screws, and X, &c., X, the required wrenches. Let S
be any screw and R,, be the virtual coefficient of'S and A,,, If the body receive a twist
about S, the quantity of energy expended must be zero, and therefore

R,X,+ &c. +R;X,=0;
8x of these equations would determine the ratios of X, &c., X;. By judicious selection
of $ the process is greatly simplified. If S be reciprocal to X, &e., X, (art. 5), then
R, &c., R, vanish, and the equation
RX, +R,X,
determines the ratio of X, and X..
