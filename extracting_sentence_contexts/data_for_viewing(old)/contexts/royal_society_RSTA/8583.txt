The limit of proportionality occurs now at about 3 tons and there is no definite
yield point. The loop areas and their rates of increase are about equal in the two
plates.

The explanation of the difference in quality shown by comparing the two diagrams
may be found in the fact that the test piece of fig. 8 was cut from a bar delivered
before the war. The test piece of fig. 9 was cut from a bar delivered towards
the end of the war. There has clearly been some change in the manufacturing
process.

bar 1 inch diameter is 54 tons per sq. inch, with an extension of 14 per cent. on
8 inches and 55 per cent. reduction of area. The limit of proportionality is at a load
of 10 tons on the standard test piece 0°625 inch diameter, corresponding to 32°5 tons
per sq. inch. Yield sets in at 11 tons, that is, 36 tons per sq. inch.
