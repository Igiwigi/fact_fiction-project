the sense of smell when the coincident carbonic acid, due to respiratory impurity,
reaches 2 vols. per 10,000, or a total of about 6 vols.

In almost all the houses and schools visited we took a note of the odour perceived
on entering the room; and, although as a general rule the odour was some indication
of the condition of the air in the room, yet this was by no means invariably so. In
some cases an extremely close and almost overpowering odour was detected when the
carbonic acid amounted to only 7 or 8 volumes per 10,000, while in other cases
the smell was only slight with as much as 17 volumes, and in one case as much as 20
volumes. In these latter instances the organic matter was only slightly above the
limit we have allowed.

The smell is, in fact, greatly influenced by the temperature, and also by the
humidity of the air, as Dz Cuaumont himself points out. The state of cleanliness
of the persons in the room, and of the room itself, has a most important influence on
the smell, quite independently of the amount of carbonic acid. There may also be
other strongly smelling substances in a room which do not appreciably affect the
chemical composition of the air. Our observations in the Infirmary wards (page 84)
were very instructive in this respect. Thus, in one ward, where the excess carbonic
acid was 2°9 volumes, there was a very perceptible odour. A few hours later the
excess in the same ward was 3°4 volumes, but the ward felt much fresher, and the
odour was barely perceptible.

For similar reasons the feeling of closeness is not a safe guide as to the amount of
organic matter in a room. The combustion of gas in a room will produce a high
