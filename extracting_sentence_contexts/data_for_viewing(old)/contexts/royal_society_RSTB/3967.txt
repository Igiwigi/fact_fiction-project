fusion with members of the cireum-medullary system. In other words, while in Pitys
the evidence appeared to show that the medullary strands are themselves the leaf-
traces, in Archaopitys they seem to be merely medullary branches of true leaf-traces
which remain at the inner border of the wood.

It is impossible to suppose that the few strands found in contact with the wood in
Pitys antiqua* represent the cireum-medullary system of Archeopitys. It is almost
certain that the former are really medullary leaf traces, which have just reached the
wood on their outward course. The other leaf-traces, which had not begun to pass
out, must be represented by some, at least, of the medullary strands, perhaps by all
except the most deeply seated. No rezular fusions, comparable to those between the
medullary and circum-medullary strands of Archwopitys, have been observed in Pitys.
We cannot in fact, trace anything like a complete homology between the primary
xylem-strands of the two genera, for in Archawopitys there appears to be a sharp
distinction between circum-medullary leaf-traces and accessory strands imbedded in
the pith, while in Pitys no differentiation is evident. The difficulty is probably due
to the imperfection of our knowledge in each case ; the presence and similar structure
of the primary strands in the pith of the two genera is sufficient, as it seems, to
establish a relationship between them.

The secondary wood does not afford much material for close comparison. In both
genera it is of the Araucarioxylon type, but the rays form a more important
constituent of the whole in Pitys than in Archaopitys, in which the wooed is altogether
of a denser structure. The dilatation of the inner ends of the rays may be mentioned
as a point common to both.
