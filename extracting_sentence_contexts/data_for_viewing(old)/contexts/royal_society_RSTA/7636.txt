pressures from about 1 atm. downwards, do not confirm Posejpal’s suggestion, for the
value found for / is within the range of values determined from work at higher pressures

DISPERSION OF AIR FOR THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM Ff

Berthelot (1907) has made an investigation, based partly on theoretical and partly

on empirical grounds, of the characteristic behaviour of gases at low pressures. Using
as theoretical basis the Van der Waals’ equation of state as modified by Clausius, and
then introducing a further modification, derived from the experimental facts, con-
cerning the departures of gases from Boyle’s law at low pressures, he obtains a general
expression for the relation between 3 (which is, in effect, a measure of the departure of
gases from Avogadro's law) and temperature. It will be seen in a later section of this
paper that the value of # determined for air at pressures from 1 atm. downwards is
also found to vary with temperature, both the magnitude and the sense of the variation
agreeing reasonably well with the expectations from Berthelot’s theory. Even better
agreement is found with the experimental results of work on the compressibility of air
as obtained by Rayleigh (1905), Berthelot and Sacerdote (see Berthelot 1907), and
Holborn and Schultze (1915). This result was obtained by applying what we believe
to be a new method of reducing the observations of refractivity at various temperatures
and pressures, based on the relation between density, temperature and pressure derived
from Berthelot’s representation of the characteristic behaviour of gases at low pressures.
