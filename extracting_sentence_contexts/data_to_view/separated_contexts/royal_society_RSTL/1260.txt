Having determined that it was a shell, I applied to Mr.
MaksDEx, as the person best acquainted with the natural


Mr. HoMz on the Teredo Gigantea, &c. 277

history of Sumatra, for further particulars respecting it. He
introduced me to his friend Mr. Gzirritns, who favoured Sir
Joszey Banks with the account, which has already been laid
before this learned Society, and also put into my possession a
variety of specimens of the shell, to assist me in prosecuting
the subject. There were no facts, by which the genus of the worm, to
which this shell belongs, could be ascertained. Sir JoszPH
Banks, however, had no doubt of its being a teredo. This
opinion rendered the subject still more interesting, since it
does not, like other teredines, live in wood.
