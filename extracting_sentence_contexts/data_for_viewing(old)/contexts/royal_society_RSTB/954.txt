eristic of the Parasuchia by Professor Huxtry, who, at the same time,
out (18, p. 41) how the “ Parasuchia, in those respects in which they
orn the Mesosuchia, approach the Ornithoscelida and the Lacertilia ” (especially
don). The many points of resemblance between the Parasuchia and certain of
ms usually included among the Dinosauria, have also been noticed by other
Bs; and the difficulty of separating the two groups is increased by a study of this
in reptile, which holds, as I think, a more intermediate position between the
es, than any form hitherto described, for although the characters of its skull
Meth find their nearest counterpart among the Dinosaurs, and the pelvis and
ight belong to either a Theropodous Dinosaur, or a Parasuchian ; the form
free astragalus is more Crocodilian than Dinosaurian. While acknowledging
ficulty of assigning this new reptile to either of these groups, it seems most
ssordance with the facts to place it provisionally with the Dinosaurs.

Aatever doubt there may be as to the precise affinities of this most interesting
me from the Elgin Sandstone, there will be none as to its being generically
Act from any known form, and I propose therefore to name it Ornithosuchus

Jwardi.
