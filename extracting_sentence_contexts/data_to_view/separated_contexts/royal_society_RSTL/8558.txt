The pressure continuing, the epithelial cells become flattened,
and finally either separate at once (figs. 13, 6 & 14,6) or first become reduced to a thin
membrane, which then gives way (fig. 12,5). In either case the result is the sxame, The
parenchymatous cell is placed in direct communication with the contents of the vesicle,
and can escape into the cavity of the 8ame. And that it does 80 is shown by the fact
that these cups or hollows formed by flattened epithelial cells are frequently seen in an
empty condition, having lost their parenchymatous cells. To swm up this process : it appears that the cells forming the parenchyma of the
thyroid gland of the dog originate in the intervesicular tissue external to the walls of the
vesicles ; from ome eause (inherent movement, or growth of cells behind them) they exert
pressure on the wall of an adjoining vesicle ; the cells of this become flattened out or
absorbed, and finally give way, allowing the parenchymatous cells to escape into the cavity,
and to form a constituent of the contents, of the vesicte; but what part these cells take
in the formation of the contents of the vesicles T am unable to state. The distribution of parenchyma through the gland appears tolerably uniform, though
probably its cells are more numerous between the small than between the large vesicles.
