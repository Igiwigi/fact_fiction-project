There has been some difference of opinion as to the elements which take part
in the formation of this epitympanic cavity. According to Hyrrt it is formed by a
divergence of the wings of the sphenoid, and the squamosal takes no part in it. Van
Kampen, on the other hand, considers it to be bounded by the squamosal, and the cavity
to lie “ as usual between the squamosal and the periotic.”” That Van Kamprn, in spite
of the fact that he had only dried adult skulls to examine, was the more correct is shown
clearly enough by the sections (text-figs. 2 and 3) of this embryo. The greater part of
the roof of the epitympanic cavity, however, is formed not so much by the squamosal,
as VAN Kampen states, as by a wing which runs upwards from the vestibular end of the
petrosal and curves round the head of the malleus, following its outline pretty closely. This part of the roof, after passing over the head, joins the squamosal, which bounds the
lateral parts of the malleus and extends backwards over the larger part of the ear region
(diagram, text-fig. 1).
