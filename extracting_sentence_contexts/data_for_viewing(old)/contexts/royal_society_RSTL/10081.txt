Some doubt mnst of course exist as to whether the substances contained in the
coprolite represent the ordinary food of the amphibia or only that to which they had
access while imprisoned in the erect trees. The facts 80 far as they go would indicate

that the larger amphibian species preyed upon the smaller, and the latter on Insects,
Millipedes and Pup.
14. Land Snails.

The additional facts obtained in relation to these I have detailed in a paper com-
municated to the American Journal of Science.* Pupa vetusta proves to be by
far the most abundant species. A very few crushed specimens of Zonites priscus
were detected. The only new species found is a minute Pups of different type from
* P. vetustd, and which T have named P. Bigsbii. These three species, with two
je. described by BraDLey from the coal formation of Tllinois (Pupa Vermilionensis and

'S Dawsonella Meeki) and a third from Ohio, recently described by Professor WrrrpreLD
> (Anthracopups Ohioensis) are 80 far the only known carboniferous pulmonates. The

'S hell which I have named Strophites grandaca,t from the Devonian of New Bruns-
SZ wick, is probably a till older representative of this group. Details with respect to
'& them will be found in the paper in the American Journal of Science above referred
