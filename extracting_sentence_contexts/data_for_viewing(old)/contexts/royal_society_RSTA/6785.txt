pressibility of the liquid is taken into account, a finite time elapses between the initiation of
4 disturbance and its appearance at a finite distance from the origin. Similarly, in the case
of the bar, the anomaly would disappear if it were possible to use the accurate equations
of § 11.

The method of stationary phase and figure 15 show that the solution derived from equation
(12:3) will differ in other respects from the solution which would be given by the accurate
theory. The (7;/T,, ¢'/37)) curves deduced by the method of stationary phase are shown in
figure 15, where the curves for the accurate and approximate theories (1st mode) are marked —
(1) and (1a) respectively. It is clear from the curves that they give different values of 7,/T,
for the same value of ¢’/}7). Again, considering a point at a finite distance from the origin, ;
as has been mentioned in § 11 (4), the disturbance represented by curve (1) is of finite dura-
tion, due to the fact that the (¢,/¢,a/A) curve shows a minimum at which c,/cy differs from —
zero. In the case of curve (1a), however, the disturbance is of infinite duration, due to the
circumstance that, in this case, ¢,/¢) tends to zero as a/A becomes infinite.

These considerations indicate that the solutions derived from equation (12-3) will not '
be correct in all respects; nevertheless, the error in the main features of the results will
probably be small if the important terms in the solution involve only values of a/A which
lie in the region where the difference between the curves (1) and (1a) in figures 13, 14 and
15 is small.
