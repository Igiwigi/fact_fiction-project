Exp. iii. Oct. 2.—I counted the respirations of a dragon-fly when it was tran-
quil, and found them 108 in the minute. I removed the head, and found them forty.
Ten minutes afterwards they were fourteen : they were quite equable, and continued
at this rate for some time longer.

Exp. iv.—The respiratory moyements of another insect were 8ixty. On the head
being removed they were twenty-five, and most regular, Ten minutes passed, and
they were fifteen. Half an hour later they were seventeen, and feebler. In another
instance they were reduced, on decapitation, from sixty-six to twenty-nine.

The foregoing experiments show that the effect of decapitation is always to dimi-
nish the frequency of the respiratory movements of the insect. They are confirmed
by those which follow ; but these prove other facts also ; and first, that the irregula-
rities in the mode and rate of breathing, which are noted in the natural respiration
of the insect, are equally observed after decapitation, and are therefore not to be
assigned to the will, or any mental state.

Exp. v.—On a day when the temperature was 59? Faur., I counted the respirations
of a cricket, in seyeral minutes, with intervals of a quarter of a minute between each
two. They were 84, 106, 79, 64, 59, 90. On the head being removed, they were 19,
27, 28, 20, 19, 14; and were less vigorous.

Exp. vi.—In a temperature of 52 Faur., the respirations of another were counted
like those of the last, and were 90, 70, 73, 72, 50, 62, and unequal in force as well as
