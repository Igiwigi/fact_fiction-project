throughout the greater part of the height of the bone. Thus it is double for 17 mm.
out of 37 mm., or not much less than one-half of its length.

At its anterior end (fig. 7) the vomer consists of two thin vertical plates of bone
applied to the sides of the median vertical ridge of the premaxilla. As we pass
backwards these two plates soon meet each other above the premaxilla, and fuse for
a short distance (fig. 6); above the level of this union the two lamin are again free,
or, to express the same fact otherwise, the dorsal border of the medial bone formed by
the union of the pair of laminz√© is grooved. At the same time the laming also extend
farther downwards, projecting into the substance of the premaxilla, and being very
closely gripped by it. From the base of the dorsal groove a delicate low median
lamina of bone projects upwards. As we pass still farther backwards (fig. 5) the free
edges of the groove thicken and then expand horizontally and are themselves grooved,
so that the dorsal surface of the vomer now presents a pair of shallow grooves and a
median deeper groove. Extensions of the palatine bones rest on the upper surface
of the lateral grooves. Passing still farther backwards, the lateral expansions of the
vomer become stouter and the cross-section changes to the form shown in fig. 4.
The median groove ceases. The ventral edge of the vomer again presents a groove,
and finally we reach the bifid posterior end, each limb of which becomes connected
with the pterygoid of its side.
