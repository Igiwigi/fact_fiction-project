possible that the terminal excess in this case may have arisen
from currents of air excited within the box by the rays of
the sun : or probably electricity is excited in the glass needle
on exposure to the rays of the sun, and the box becoming
electric by induction, a drag between the needle and the box
causes a diminution in the arc of vibration. The latter sup-
position would accord with the recent highly interesting ex-
periments of Mr. BapBaGe. I am not aware that such effects
as these have ever before been observed during vibration,
and there certainly appears great difficulty in assigning any
cause for them : however, until further observations may
have thrown greater light on the subject, we must be satis-
fied with having ascertained the facts.

I have not as yet made any observations to ascertain what
may be the effects when a needle vibrates exposed to the


influence in the $olar rays. 239

Separated rays, but having an apparatus for the purpose, I
propose doing s0 when the season becomes more favourable
for such experiments than it is at present.
