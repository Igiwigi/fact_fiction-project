Valley at 1,600 feet.

Dr. R. CnamBrs|| noted an ice-abraded rock at the top of Glen Glaster with the
smoothed side to the N.W. He refers also to many glaciated surfaces at from 1,700 to
2,000 feet, but nob at greater heights.

Mr. JamizsoN examined in particular Glen Treig and Glen Arkaig for evidence of
glacial action at heights. At the entrance of the former he found ice-strice as high as

1,280 feet above the level of the loch, or more than 2,000 feet above the sea, but is of
opinion that ice action extended even higher. In Glen Spean he © was sbruck with
glaciation, then there would be no objection to place the © roads ” at the end of the 8econd period. In
fact, it would be necessary, as the second glaciation must then have obliterated any *roads” of the first.
