to be* 7z* 10; this, when compared with many, and very
accurate observations made by Mr. Cavexpisn, with several
needles in the yearf 1773, who found it to be 72* go', makes
the decrease in this period of 35 years on a mean, 2'.9 per
annum. And from a comparison of my own observations of
the dip in 180, which was 70* 21', with the above of Mr.
Cavenpisn in 1775, its annual decrease, on a mean, appears
to have been 4/,g; and its progressive annual decrease on a
mean in the above mentioned period of go years 1,4. I cannot conclude this Paper without expressing my regret,
that 80 little avail should have been made of the numerous
opportunities which have been afforded to travellers and
others in the last century for making accurate observations
with proper instruments, at land, on the variation in different
parts of the world: such observations would probably have
afforded some curious and useful facts which would have ma-
terially assisted in forming a theory much more certain than
what we at present possess ; the present received opinion of
the cause of the diurnal alteration of variation would be con-
firmed or invalidated ; its quantity of effect in different places,
a most desirable acquisition, would be ascertained ; and we
Should be put in possession of more valuable and correct
information on the variation than can be derived from obser-
vations made with the common azimuth compass, even at
land, owing to its imperfect construction. The variation thus
accurately obtained at any one period, compared with the
variation correctly ascertained at a subsequent period, would
