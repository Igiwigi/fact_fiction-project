Since &
the crack runs again close to the SD the failure type is again an intercrystalline one. Despite :
this, the fracture toughness is higher compared with Orientation A. The reason for this can be
found in the fact that the crack-bifurcation reduces the local driving force for crack propagation. For a short-kinked crack, the local driving force is only about 50% of the global one [33]. Therefore, without considering any further plastification, the fracture toughness in Orientation
B should be about twice as large as for Orientation A, which has to be regarded as a lower
bound value since for a pure Mode-I propagation higher driving forces, i.e. fracture toughness
would be needed.
