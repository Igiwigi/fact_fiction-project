to be considered.

The name Nematothallus has been given to the flat, leaf-like or thalloid fragments,
probably derived from a number of species, that occur in great abundance in all
the Downtonian deposits. Their construction of associated tubes, often of two
distinct orders of width, corresponds so closely with that characteristic of Prototaxites
that the assumption of a systematic relationship between the two fossils appears
fully justified. It seems, indeed, quite possible that flat expansions with the
organization of Nematothallus may have been borne on stems with the structure of
Prototaxites, but no proof of this has been obtained. To the general type of
associated-tube construction in which the two agree, the study of Nematothallus has
added several interesting and significant histological features. There is first the
fact of the wide tubes, in some types at least, having had a distinct annular thickening
of their walls, which were thin, as compared with those of Prototaxites. The impression
given by these elements is that they were in some ways analogous to, or homoplastic
with, the water-conducting elements of vascular plants. So far as the complete
structure can be ascertained from the compressed and decayed specimens, the
wide tubes appear to have been present especially in the internal tissues and may
perhaps have been associated to form conducting tracts. The more peripheral
tissues consisted of an increasingly fine and close network of the slender tubes,
which are also present in the deeper layers. Secondly, there is the presence of
a definite cuticular covering to the expansions thus composed of associated tubes.
The cuticle has a characteristic pseudo-cellular pattern, and was readily detached
by maceration. Thirdly, there is the presence among the tubes below the cuticle
of firm-walled, presumably cuticularized, spores of various sizes. In some cases
