(b) Isolated leaf primordia

A notable feature of these experiments—which are of a preliminary and exploratory
nature—has been the very limited growth undergone by partially isolated leaf primordia.
This is in marked contrast to the normal development. The incisions, which were made as
close to the young primordium as possible, had the effect of curtailing the transverse area
across which nutrients could move to the developing organ. Nevertheless, reduction in
the size of the leaf-base seems scarcely adequate to account for the very restricted growth
of the isolated primordium. It has been seen that under comparable conditions an isolated
meristem may make considerable growth. The hypothesis that activating substances pro-
ceeding from the apical meristem are necessary for the growth of the leaf primordia—as
distinct from their inception—would appear to be ruled out by the fact that leaf primordia
isolated on the same panel as the apical meristem also undergo little enlargement. Snow
& Snow (1937) have shown that if heteroauxin in lanoline is applied to a part of the stem
apex in certain flowering plants, the growth of the existing leaf primordium and bud, or
of those which subsequently arise, is promoted. When a leaf primordium is isolated from
the apical meristem in D. aristata it may be that the restricted development is due to the
absence of auxin proceeding from the meristem. In the case of a primordium isolated on
the same plug of tissue as the apical meristem, the temporary cessation of apical growth
due to the incision of the shoot may perhaps account for the restricted development of the
primordium. An alternative hypothesis, that activating substances proceeding from older
