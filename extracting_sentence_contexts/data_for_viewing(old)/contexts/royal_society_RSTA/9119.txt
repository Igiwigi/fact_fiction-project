wholly get rid of the phenomenon, but the evidence in its favour does not appear
conclusive. Our final results for the length of the interval from, the two lowest grades
of disturbed days ought, if the phenomenon were true, to be decidedly longer than the
length derived from the selected Q days ; but the reverse is the case. There ought
also to be a decided difference between the lengths of the intervals derived from, the
positive previous pulses for all D days and for the D days of characters not less than 1-5,

The difference is insignificant and is in the wrong direction. The fact that so big a
difference exists in the case of the most highly disturbed group of days between the
lengths of the intervals, as derived from the subsequent and previous pulses, raises a
doubt as to the complete success of the method we have adopted for eliminating the
effect of skewness when the skewness is large. If we took as the length of the interval
half the interval between the crests of the first secondary pulses subsequent and
previous, which closely resemble one another, we should find 27-20 from the days of
character « 1-5, as compared with 27-04 from, the 5 selected D days, and 27-01 from the
selected Q days. The intervals derived from, the second, third and fourth subsequent
pulses appear all slightly longer for the days of character « 1-5 than for the 5 selected
D days, but the difference between the two 108-day intervals comes out less than 0-3
day. The days of character « 1-5, it should be remembered, are comparatively few,
and accident plays a more than usually large part in the results derived from them.
