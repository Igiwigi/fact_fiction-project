In an unchanging series of independent values, i.e., one in which the frequency of
occurrence of any value is independent of the time, all the quantities 2’, except z,', will
be distributed in symmetrical curves about the mean value zero. If the values of x
are normally distributed about the mean m, with standard deviation co, then all the
values of x will be normally distributed with standard deviation oc, z,/, about a mean
m/ n, and the remainder about zero. This follows at once from the fact that the distri-
bution of the points representing the sample will be a globular normal cluster, and conse-
quently the distribution of their projections on a line drawn in any direction will be
invariable. Even when the values of x are not normally distributed, those of 2’ will
in general be much more nearly so, owing to the properties of compound distributions
which have often been discussed. The simplest type of changing series is one in which the several values are distributed
independently and in similar distributions, but about a changing mean.
