commonly made for the analysis of wind turbines, the structure is modelled with beam elements
that behave in a linearly elastic manner.

The main forces acting on this system are wave and wind loads. It is these irregular loads
and their fluctuations during a lifetime of 20 or more years that the wind turbine has to be
designed for and against [2]. Nonlinearities only arise in this loading, and the structure reacts
linearly to it. This can be used to advantage, e.g. using the impulse-response formalism to
significantly speed up the analysis [3]. In fact, the structural model of the support structure
can be understood as a system of coupled damped oscillators that are driven by external
forces. The simplification this allows is a major motivation for decoupling the rotor from the
support structure.

Rotor load models is the generic name for a class of models that provide time series of forces,
or moments, at an interface node (typically the tower top), in approximation of the true rotor :
loads that one would obtain from a more comprehensive rotor simulation. These models serve =

approach to this requires a linear state-space representation of the rotor dynamics. th
