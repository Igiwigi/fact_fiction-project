In order to test this, an infusion was given to one cat, B (Experiment XXI.), and an
infusion containing a quantity of powder to another. The latter, however, contrary to
expectation, recovered, whereas the former died. The experiment, however, was vitiated
by the fact that the infusion was made from the finely pulverized bark, the only kind
we had at our disposal at the time, and consequently contained a quantity of it in
suspension, which would not have been the case if the infusion had been made from a
coarsely pounded bark. In order to ascertain whether the vomiting and purging were due to the local action
of the drug on the stomach and intestines, or to its action on the nervous system after
its absorption into the blood, a comparison was made between the effects of the poison
when introduced into the stomach and when injected under the skin. Our experiments
show that whereas vomiting was invariably produced by the casca, in whatever manner
introduced into the system, purging only occurred when the poison was given by the
