METSCHNIKOFF came to the same conclusion in the case of the bipinnaria of Spezia (63, p. 46), a larva
which apparently undergoes metamorphosis without fixation (see also p. 255).

MorTeENSEN (71, p. 5) standardised the nomenclature for bipinnarie in general, and figured and
described the bipinnaria and brachiolaria of our species. The notices of larves by METSCHNIKOFF (63, 64),
Bury (8, 9), Gorrre (31), SEMON (86), and Freip (23) are chiefly of importance from the point of view
of internal structure, but certain features of external form, particularly in regard to the development of

' the ciliated tracts, are emphasised by the two authors cited last. The papers of DELAGE (17, 18) on

rearing parthenogenetic larye of 4. glacialis should also be referred to here. Although not primarily
dealing with form and structure, they provide some useful data regarding the appearance and habits of
the larva at different stages, and mention the shrinkage and absorption of the preoral lobe, and the fact
of fixation at metamorphosis.

Processes.—The growth of the bipinnaria, and its change to the brachiolaria, as
well as the gradual development and final proportions of the ciliated processes,
brachia and sucker will be followed from the illustrations on Plates 18-20, par-
ticularly from figs. 5-11. Using Morrensen’s (71, pp. 6-7) terminology, we
distinguish at such a stage as is shown in fig. 10, (1) belonging to the preoral
band, the preoral process (paired), and the three brachia; (2) belonging to the
postoral Land, the postoral process (paired), the posterior lateral process (paired),
the posterior dorsal process (paired), the anterior dorsal process (paired), and the
median dorsal process (single), It will be convenient also to apply the term
“ cireumoral field” (pp. 229 and 240) to the area which lies between the preoral and
