4. The melting points do not differ much from each other, in fact those of Cugl,.2Agl,
CugTz.3Agl, Cugl,.4Agl, and Cuylz.12AgT, are practically the same; but they are
considerably lower than those of their constituents : 7.e., more than 100? C. lower
than that of iodide of copper, and more than 30? C. lower than that of iodide of
gilver.
