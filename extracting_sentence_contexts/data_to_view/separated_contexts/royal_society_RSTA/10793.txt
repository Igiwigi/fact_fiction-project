The data I have given seem entirely opposed to Mr. Sepe¢wick’s view, but I very
fully realise that they are far from exhaustive. They indicate, however, what
I hold to be the only valid method of approaching any problem in variation or
heredity, 7.¢., laborious statistical collection of actual facts. My statistics may be
insufficient, I would heartily welcome additions to them; or they may be dealt with
fallaciously. Here is the material; let others add to and, if need be, modify the
conclusions.
