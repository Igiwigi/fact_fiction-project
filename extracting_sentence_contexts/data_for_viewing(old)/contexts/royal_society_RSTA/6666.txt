The modes of ternary fission discussed in the previous sections involve the emission of
a light nucleus in addition to the two heavy fragments. This process is roughly analogous to
the emission of secondary neutrons, assuming that these neutrons are emitted instantaneously.
It is possible that fission of the compound nucleus may also give rise to three fragments of
comparable mass, as has been suggested by Present & Knipp (1940).

Ifsuch a mode of ternary fission occurs, the triple tracks produced in photographic plates
are in many cases entirely similar to those caused by heavy nuclear recoils, and the two types
of track are not always distinguishable by the application of rules based on the principle of
conservation of momentum. The plates used in the experimental investigation of recoil
tracks (ยง3) were fully sensitive to light recoils, and would therefore have recorded tracks of
heavy fragments produced in ternary fission. In this investigation, such tracks would have
been included in the count of heavy recoils; the fact that the observed abundance of heavy
recoils was fairly low (1 in 29 fission events) proves that fission into three heavy fragments
is not of frequent occurrence.

An independent investigation of a large number of fission tracks was undertaken in a
search for triple tracks which could be ascribed definitely to ternary fission as distinct from
heavy recoils. No such track was found in 5000 fission events examined in a plate which
was fully sensitive to heavy ions but insensitive to a-particles. The abundance of these tracks
must therefore be very low. Since this experiment was completed, Tsien, Ho, Vigneron &
Chastel (1947) have reported a single case of ternary fission into heavy fragments, but these
authors have not determined the abundance of such events.
