Even if the selection were not catastrophic
but spread over centuries and centuries, we must recognise what a large consumption
of life there must be—individuals destroyed without progeny*—if we are to suppose
any highly civilized race like the French produced by selection from an apparently
primitive type like the Aino, Indeed, the return journey in this case seems much
easier than the upward ascent. Beyond all this we have only made French and
Aino alike for two organs, and only for one character of each of them! Allowing for
our conventional limit to the population, allowing for the fact that our Aino data are
drawn from a very limited population of remarkably small variability, it seems very
improbable that the French have ever been produced by selection from a primitive
race at all resembling the Aino. The fact that the Aino could be so much more
easily obtained by selection from the French seems to indicate that they are rather

* Of course, with a secular selection spread over many generations, it is largely the potentiality and not
the actuality of life which is destroyed, Still, while the gross number killed among a small primitive
community may not be large, the death-rate must still be immense. I hope to return to these points
when dealing with secular selection as distinguished from catastrophic selection.
