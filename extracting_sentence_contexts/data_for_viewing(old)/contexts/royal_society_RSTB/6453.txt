unknown, to the disappearance of the primordial reproductive system that is not
being stimulated. Observations on free-martins, as well as the results of experimental
parabiosis in Amphibia, show that male hormone is more dominant than female
hormone, and that when a zygotic female embryo is exposed to the influence of male
hormone, its Wolffian system develops at the expense of its Miillerian system, which
ceases to differentiate.

The precise nature of the ‘‘male” and ‘“‘female’’ hormones concerned in sexual
differentiation has not, to our knowledge, been demonstrated. Such male hormones
as were used on the animals we studied were apparently without effect on the hydatids
of Morgagni, whereas they caused profound changes in organs derived from the
Wolffian duct. This result is in keeping with present knowledge of embryonic develop-
ment, and with the fact that none of the male hormones we used has any marked
oestrogenic activity. Furthermore, the refractoriness of the hydatids to male hormone
suggests that such differentiation as some of these appendages display in post-uterine
life (e.g. O.M. 18) must have been effected, independently of endocrine influence,
during the sexually indifferent phase of embryonic life. For, as is widely believed, male
hormone is normally produced relatively earlier by genotypic male embryos than
female hormone is by genotypic female embryos, and once the endocrine environment
has become masculine in character the Miillerian ducts begin to retrogress, and no
further differentiation is possible.

WIESNER (1935) has suggested an alternative theory of sexual differentiation
which is at variance with the one expounded by Wirscur. According to him, the
Miillerian system differentiates completely in virtue of its genic constitution alone, and
