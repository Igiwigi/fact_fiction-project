In these experiments, the low
noise regime was revealed to occur on the effectively red-detuned side of the cavity resonance. Access to the soliton state in steady state was compounded however by thermal effect [76], as
red-detuned operation is not thermally stable. To nevertheless stably access the DKS state an
optimized laser tuning scheme [24], and later ‘power kicking’ [18] was developed that allowed
overcoming the rapid temperature changes, associated with the discontinuous steps, and with
the fact that the strong pump laser is detuned from the unstable, red-detuned side of the cavity
resonance. Fortuitously, if this laser ramp is applied the soliton can be stably accessed: indeed, in
the presence of a DKS the stability can be restored, as the soliton is a solution of the upper branch,
being effectively blue detuned (and thus thermally stable [76]), while the CW pump laser is in the
unstable red-detuned region, but far detuned from cavity resonance. Applying this novel laser
detuning technique allowed to stabilize soliton states and to prove unequivocally the observation
of combs that are associated with soliton femtosecond pulses [23,24].
