The big problem for any version of mentalism is that only
finitely many brain states have actually been (or could be)
realized; hence, there are only finitely many mental represen-
tations or intellectual constructions. So the idea that numbers
are mental entities conflicts with the fact that for any finite
number, there is a yet greater number. Here is one way
in which we can know this fact: any cardinal number n is the
number of preceding numbers, as we start with zero; so
the number of numbers up to and including n is greater than n
by one.

(d) The set-size view

This is the view that cardinal numbers are sizes of sets. Set size
is a discrete magnitude; in other respects, it is much like length,
duration and weight (which we tend to think of as dense
and continuous magnitudes). The set-size view takes our pre-
theoretical thought and talk literally: ‘class size’ in normal
parlance refers to the number of pupils in a class, and ‘family
size’ refers to the number of family members.
