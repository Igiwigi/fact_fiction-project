Although vegetation is likely to change, its effect :
on the C budget is unclear as increased soil C losses from priming effects (changes in microbial =
activity and decomposition rates due to increased inputs to the soil) may counteract increased C [=
inputs [51]. a

A key aspect of the PInc-PanTher decomposition trajectories, which can be seen in figure 3, :
are the divergent results between surface soils, where decomposition increases are moderate aa)
and more geographically uniform, versus deeper soils, where fractional decomposition losses are tw
highest at the retreating permafrost margins and zero in the areas that remain permafrost. Overall, iY
such a pattern leads to losses that are primarily from shallower soils. A crucial question is whether :3
this is a realistic signature of permafrost C losses, i.e. whether C losses are in fact faster in thawed [8
soil layers (taliks) that do not seasonally refreeze than in surface soils that still freeze seasonally :
even with warming, and whether a large contribution comes from lengthed thaw periods in
shallow soils. Experimental and field observations of the C dynamics of retreating permafrost
are needed to address this. On longer time scales, we may expect the contribution from deeper
soils and initially permafrost layers to overtake shallower soils in importance, as suggested by
the increasing role of deep soils beyond 2100 in Koven ef al. [52].
