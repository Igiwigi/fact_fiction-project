carburetted hydrogen, the redundant oxygen, and a very
minute quantity of nitrogen introduced bythe latter: gas.
Hitherto, I have prepared: this gas only in a-small- quantity,
but it would be easy to, extend: the scale of the operation,
and to remove the excess of oxygen by obvious methods.

SECTION III.

APPLICATION OF THE FACTS TO THE ANALYSIS OF MIXTURES OF
THE COMBUSTIBLE GASES IN UNKNOWN PROPORTIONS.

At an early period of the investigation described in the
first 'section; I proceeded to apply the facts of which I was
then possessed, to the analysis of a mixture of gases in un-
known proportions. For this purpose, I caused a quantity of
gas to be collected from coal, by continuing the application of
heat to the retorts two hours beyond the usual period, and
receiving the gas iinto-a separate vessel. Gas of this quality
was purposely'' chosen, because, from former. experience, I
expected it to. contain free hydrogen, carbonic oxide, and
carburetted hydrogen, but no olefiant gas, the production of
which is. confined to the early stages of the progress. After
washing it, therefore, with liquid -potash to remove a little
carbonic acid, and ascertaining its specific gravity when thus
