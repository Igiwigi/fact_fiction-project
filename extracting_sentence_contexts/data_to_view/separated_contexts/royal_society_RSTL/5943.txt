Rexvv will always be honourably associated with the theory of glacier motion. He
first drew attention to the power of the glacier to move through a sinuous valley, to narrow and widen and
behave like lava or like © a 8oft paste.” He conjectured also that the centre would moye more quickly than
the sides. In fact he appears to have had a correct conception of almost all that the 8ubsequent observa-
tions of Professor Foupss established. IT regret to 8ay that T have not been able to obtain M. Renvu's
original memoir.
