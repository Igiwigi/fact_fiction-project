(28) This intimate connexion of the sensory division of the fifth nerye with the vagus

- and glossopharyngeal nerves in the grey tubercle, as well as the connexion, just shown. | of its motor nucleus with the glossopharyngeal nucleus, with the returning fibres of i
t glossopharyngeal nerve, and with the © fasciculus teres,” are facts of uncommon interest. | 1-(29) The longitudinal fibres (V V', fig. 8, Plate VIIL.) immediately in front, and on
\ the outer side, of the hypoglossal nucleus (2') have the same kind of anatomical con-
| nexion with that nucleus as the antero-lateral white columns of the spinal cord have
with its anterior horn.
