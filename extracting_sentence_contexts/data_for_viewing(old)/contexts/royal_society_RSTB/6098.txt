ventral nerve-roots were to be explained by the disappearance of protometameric
segments, which had formerly existed in the auditory region. It must be emphasized
that there is no evidence of phylogenetic changes of such a nature. ‘‘ On the contrary
there is good reason to believe that for the most part myotomes once laid down persist,
and that the chief change that takes place in the course of ontogeny is the crushing
of the anterior myotomes owing to the growth backwards of the auditory sac and
capsule, of the vagus, and of the gill sacs” (GoopricH, 1918). The only case so far
known of a myotome laid down and subsequently disappearing is that of the transient
occipital myotome which arises from the second metotic somite, as already described.
With regard to its dissolution, the findings reported here agree with those of JacEr
(1924), except that the process is slightly retarded in the duck. This seems to be a
general characteristic of the latter as compared with the chick, and is illustrated also
in the time-relations of the first metotic somite and in the fact that the anterior head
cavity is still present in the duck when the eye-muscles begin to form, while it has
already disappeared at the corresponding stage in the chick (ADELMANN, 1927). In
the gull, the second metotic somite appears to disintegrate somewhat earlier, for even
as early as the 12-somite stage, Rex (1905) describes this somite as represented only
by a condensation of radiating cells at its posterior border. Burcuer (1929) notes
the similarity of this to the conditions in the rat. However, it is certain that in all
of these forms, the muscle-fibres of the second metotic somite have lost their individual
existence by the 30-somite stage, and this accounts for the frequent assertions in the
literature to the effect that only four myotomes arise in the head in birds.

Cutarvat (1890) described the development of only three occipital ventral nerve-
roots in the chick, but Jager (1924) has described four, which agrees with the conditions
