This length scale was first noted experimentally by Sanchez et al. [21] and investigated
numerically by Thampi et al. [14,16]. Its nature, however, remains elusive (see §5 for further
discussion on this matter). The growth of the flow field generated by a defect at large distances can also be cut off by
a frictional force f, =—¢,v as may arise from the fact that the nematic film is confined at an
oil/ water interface [51]. Such a frictional interaction with the subphase removes energy from the
flow at the length scale ¢, = ./7/¢s, thus controlling the decay of the velocity field. Finally, the limit
where the friction dominates viscous forces corresponding to a no-slip Hele-Shaw geometry has
been discussed in detail by Pismen [34].
