Taking the
Zatomic heat of 8, in accordance with the above discussion, at 54, that of B would be
$27; the numbers obtained directly for the atomic heat of boron (4 82) from the expe-
Sriments on the specific heat of this element agree with sufficient accuracy. In the sequel
Al take the atomic heat of B at 27. A smaller number is obtained in other compari-
80ns; for instance, of the atomic heats of B, O, and of the oxides R, O,, or of the salts
RBO, and the oxides R, Â©, ; but in such indirect determinations of the atomic heat,
where such small numbers are to be determined, as is here the case with the atomic heat
of boron, the results are very uncertain, owing to the fact that the entire uncertainty in
the atomic heats of the compounds, and in the assumption that the elements correspond-
ing to boron in compounds of analogous ink. peta have really the atomic heat = 6-4,
is thrown on the final result. Lastly, carbon also, from the direct determinations of its specific heat ($ 82), has a
much smaller atomic heat than 6:4.
