as to deserve minute and laborious research ; and notwithstanding the partial essays
of Vox Bucn and others, the whole subject remains in a state of confusion, and is
involved in incongruities and contradictions . The chief point to which the ob-
servations about to be described were directed, is the temperature of thermal springs ;
and, referring to this point alone, we might prove the almost total absence of exact
data on the subject. Every traveller, to be sure, has measured the temperature of
springs, but few have been aware of the difficulties which even this apparently simple
inquiry involves.

We should have considered the accurate determination of the temperatures of
thermal springs the first step towards a theory of their production F. The constancy
of that temperature from day to day, from year to year, from century to century,
would appear one of the most essential facts to determine ; yet I am aware of scarcely
a single published obseryation capable of being satisfactorily employed in such an
inquiry. Not only are the errors of the instruments unknown, but the circumstances

+ I have for a number of years been making collections respecting springs of all kinds, of which the present
can be considered but as one division. Feeling, however, the doubtfulness of my ever completing this investi-
gation, and the importance of stating completely all that relates to minute topographical details soon after the
observations are made, I have lost no time in proceeding to the reduction of these Pyrenean experiments,
