These
multiple factors reciprocally interact inducing a vicious cycle of toxicity that
causes altered synaptic plasticity, morphological changes and finally cell death. The current therapeutic approaches only alleviate the clinical symptoms, but
they cannot cure the disease by changing the natural course of this disorder. In
fact, until now, no therapy has been developed to stop or at least slow down the
neurodegeneration occurring in dopaminergic neurons in PD patients. Levodopa (3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine, L-DOPA) is a precursor of DA and
it represents the first and most successful breakthrough in the symptomatic treat-
ment of PD. In fact, DA replacement therapy with L-DOPA is still the gold
standard for symptomatic treatment of PD.
