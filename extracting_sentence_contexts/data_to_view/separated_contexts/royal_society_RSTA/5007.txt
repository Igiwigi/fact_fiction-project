2 Hence as d* diminishes from j4a* to 0, the time of revolution increases from
HAan/3Z to o.

= The fact, that when d*= 0, the time is infinitely great, may be verified by finding
Sthe time along the axis of the vortex sphere from end to end, and the time along a
=neridian from one end of the axis to the other. 2h These are

$Shoth of which are infinitely great. £ This result does not constitute a difficulty, for if a particle anywhere on the axis of
éthe sphere could reach the extremity then it would not be clear along which meridian
of the sphere it should subsequently move.
