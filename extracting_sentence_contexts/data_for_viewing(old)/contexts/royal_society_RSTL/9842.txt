have been in any case, nor how much it may have closed in on the sun in course of
concentration, we have no means of computing the primitive angular momentum of a
planet. A rigorous method of comparison of the primitive rotations of the several
planets is thus wanting.

If however the planets were formed under similar conditions, then, according to
the present theory, we should expect to find the exterior planets now rotating more
rapidly than the interior ones. It has been shown above (se Table IV., note to \ 8)
that, on making allowance for the different degrees of concentration of the planets,
this is the cage.

That the interior satellite of Mars revolves with a period of less than a third of its
planet's rotation is perhaps the most remarkable fact in the solar system. The theory
of tidal friction explains this perfectly,* and we find that this will be the ultimate

* It is proper to remark that the rapid revolution of this satellite might perhaps be referred to another
canse, although the explanation appears very inadequate.

Tt has been pointed ont above that the formation of a satellite out of a chain or ring of matter must be
accompanied by a diminution of periodic time and of distance. Thus a satellite might after formation
have a shorter periodic time than its planet.

Tf this, howeyer, were the explanation, we should expect to find other instances elsewhere, but the case
of the Martian satellite stands quite alone.
