Another animal, E75, was pregnant for the first time when
killed, and in this case the second molar tooth had come into use, so that the age at first
pregnancy must vary considerably between individuals. In general, however, it is evident
from the cases described that the wild African elephant may begin to breed at about
9 years of age, and that puberty is usually reached when the animal is not much more than
10 years old.

(1) Puberty, first pregnancy and lactation

In the above account, two animals have been described as being pregnant for the first
time. That E147 was in fact pregnant for the first time seems certain from the size of the
animal compared with others which were nulliparous, but the condition of the mammary
glands appears to afford convincing evidence on the point. The mammary glands were
accessible and were examined in twenty-four of the pregnant animals, and milk could
easily be expressed from nineteen of them. There were two doubtful cases, but in three
animals, all of which were small, the mammary glands were definitely inactive.
