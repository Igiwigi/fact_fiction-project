Such, however, is certainly not the cage. The sharply
defined outlines and exquisite preseryation of their innermost cells demonstrate that no
such decay has affected these specimens. In its very young tate the pith was olid and
unbrokenâ€”a fact demonstrated by the specimen represented in Table 3, fig. 7 of Mr.
Bixxey's Monograph already referred to. But the small size and exceeding rarity of all
8uch specimens demonstrates that the rapid growth of the woody axis caused the Pith to
become ruptured and fistular at a very early period.
