sion sweat warrants not only a fine-tuned sensory analysis, but
in addition an immediate response selection. This is especially
important for women, as globally, about one-third of ever-
partnered women have experienced physical and/or sexual
intimate partner violence [45].

Men, however, respond to a lesser extent to all sweat
samples, but still do show a differential brain response to
aggression as contrasted to control sweat. This response
occurs at a relatively late processing stage (P3-2) and is more
prominent in response to female sweat. However, as male par-
ticipants show almost no response to female control sweat, the
significant difference is due to the fact that they still show a
slight response to female aggression signals. A heightened sen-
sitivity to same-sex aggression in males, as proposed by some
authors [22], could not be statistically confirmed by the present
data. However, a weak differentiation of male aggression
signals from male control signals in male participants is
suggested by visual inspection of the grand averages (figure 1)
and direct effect testing (P3-2 amplitude: EMO within male
sweat within men Fj 4,=4.14, p=0.048). Whereas brain
responses to male aggression sweat in females could be partly

due to the fact that male aggression sweat was slightly odorous
but male control sweat was not, the brain responses to female
