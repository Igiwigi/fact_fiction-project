which is the first approximation to the coeflicient of viscosity of a simple gas
composed entirely of molecules of the first kind. Some idea of the accuracy of
(17°02) as a first approximation may be gained from the fact that for a simple gas
the error (7.c., of (17°03)) amounts to only 1°6 per cent. for rigid elastic spherical
molecules, and less for n“ power centres of force (¢f. my second memoir, loc. cit., § 11),
the first approximation being too small.
