111. It is obvious from this theory that the united points of functions of this
system compose definite tetrads, so that one point of a tetrad being given the
remaining three are generally determinate.

In fact (434) is a quartic transformation connecting united points q with the
auxiliary points p, so that one point p corresponds to one point g, while four points ¢
correspond to one point p. For a given point p, these four points are by (434) the
intersections of the quartic surfaces, for arbitrary quaternions J,

But these surfaces have a common curve (435); and three surfaces having a
common curve intersect in
