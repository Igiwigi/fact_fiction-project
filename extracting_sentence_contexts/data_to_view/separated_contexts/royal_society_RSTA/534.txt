is accounted for by the fact that the largest number of points with the largest values of electron
density falls in that range of time. Taking into account the averaging of the electron density over
the cross section of the microwave beam (focused spot), the calculated value n?"™ agrees well with
the measured data and lies in the interval of absolute electron density values of (2-6) x 10!2 cm-3. Data on the gas temperature during the initial combustion stage are taken from our
experiments [6], in which a gas temperature in conditions close to isobaric was determined
using a holographic interferometer.
