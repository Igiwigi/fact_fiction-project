(c) Interpretation
This diversity of the Rhynie dispersed spore assemblage is
lower than all of the other sequences, despite the fact that
the Rhynie sequence was one of the most exhaustively
sampled with 70 productive samples logged. This suggests
that the Rhynie flora was somewhat depauperate compared
to the others. The most likely explanation is that the Rhynie
flora represents one existing in an inland intermontane
basin where the environment was more stressed than that
in the lowland floodplain deposits represented by the depos-
its from southwest Wales and Gasp√©. The very high taxon
diversity reported from the Ardennes-Rhenish region probably
reflects the fact that these assemblages are from nearshore
marine deposits into which numerous rivers drained bringing
elements of the floras from throughout the entire drainage
basin (i.e. representing the inland intermontane basin and
floodplain deposits). Further evidence that the Rhynie spore
assemblage represents an inland intermontane basin flora is
the presence of taxa unique to Rhynie, such as Dictyotriletes
kerpii, Brochotriletes sp. CW-A and Camptozonotriletes? sp.
CW-A, that may represent taxa endemic to the inland uplands
(electronic supplementary material, table S1).

The spore assemblages from the different sequences may
be compared in terms of similarity by analysing the number
