characteristic lengths associated to these distributions are also consistently similar (200 < A < 300),
thus suggesting that the common biological mechanisms involved in CG methylation are reflected
in the similar DNA structure at the scale of dinucleotide inter-distance.

The remaining organisms (figure 3) span a larger range of organismal complexity, thus the
overall picture appears more heterogeneous from a biological point of view, and this is reflected in
our analysis. For example, E. coli, a bacterium that does not possess similar epigenetic mechanisms
and probably does not exploit DNA methylation processes for the same purposes as pluricellular
organisms, does not present significant differences between dinucleotide distributions. The same
is true for Adenovirus. This different behaviour might be justified by a different role of DNA


methylation in bacteria, or by the fact that only a small portion of bacterial DNA is affected
by this process [45]. Thus, our statistical approach might not be sensitive enough to highlight
possible differences. The case of fruit fly looks similar, since the difference between dinucleotide
distributions is not as marked, as shown in the double-logarithmic plot of figure 5. This is
consistent with what is known about the very low levels of DNA methylation in fruit fly, and
the absence of DNMT family hortologues [39].

This approach has been exploited to classify organisms in phylogenetic trees [19], but our
analysis shows that it might also help infer the presence of DNA epigenetic mechanisms in poorly
characterized organisms, even if a clear association of these observations with specific biological
mechanisms is yet to come.
