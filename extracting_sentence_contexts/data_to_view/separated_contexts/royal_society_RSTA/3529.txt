Comparisons
between the numerical and asymptotic predictions of the spatial distributions of 61, /00 at selected
values of Dif are included in figure 6d. Reasonable agreement is observed for Dit < 1, although
the asymptotic analysis overpredicts the concentrations near the front that demarcates the regions
where 67 = 1 and 67 = 0. Again, consistent with the fact that the hydrogen is present only behind
this front, the J versus Dif curve in figure 6a shows a sharp increase when this front reaches x = 1,
ie. at DLf ~ 1/6. We note in passing that numerical predictions for regime Ila are not included as
