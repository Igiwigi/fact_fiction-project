accumulate at an angle of 40?, or even more, for I have seen scoriz settle on a slope of
£42* before my eyes in the recent cone built up in October and November 1857, within
Sthe crater of Vesuvius ; but in this instance the lava was in a state of semi-fusion when
Mt fell, and the separate fragments may have been soldered together.

» I will now briefly sum up some of the leading conclusions to which we have been led
Sby the facts described in the foregoing pages, or first part of this memoir.
E lst. Lavas which consolidate on steep slopes at angles varying from 15® to 40?, do not
Sconsist of a confused mass of scorize or of fragmentary matter, but of distinct parts,
Znamely, an upper and lower mass of scoriz, with an intermediate stony layer,
6 2ndly. The core or central portion forms a tabular and continuous sheet of compact
Eztone parallel to the overlying and underlying scoriaceous formations, and usually pass-
Sing somewhat abruptly into them.
S 3rdly. The lower mass of scoriz, where the slope is very steep, is more commonly
Sdivided into distinct strata than the upper crust.
Z 4thly. There is usually a greater evenness and parallelism of the beds where lavas have
Recongealed at high angles, than where they have consolidated on more gently sloping
ground.
5thly. When successive streams of lava have flowed one over the other down steep
