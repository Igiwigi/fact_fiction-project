earth produces its effect on the luminous discharge by permitting the electric forces
caused by or arising from the discharge within the tube to produce electric displace-
ment within it and the system connected with it, And as it is immaterial how the
actual displacement is produced, we may, without affecting the result, suppose that
there is a snitable charge of electricity sent into the tinfoil from g8ome source without,
the tube. This charge will, of course, be the game in quantity, but opposite in 8ign, to
that which passes out of the tinfoil to the earth. We may thus discard all thoughts
of relief or non-relief, and consider both states as being due to charges sent into the
tinfoil from external sources at the proper times. And in the case of the relief-effect
it is evident that these charges will be co-periodic with the electrical changes in the
tube since they are caused by them.

In considering this subject we are at once sbruck with the fact that the non-relief-
effect has been, up to this stage of the inquiry, produced only by connecting the
tinfoil electrically with the air-spark terminal. It is evident that the peculiarity
possessed by this source of electricity does not arise from its high or low potential, for
we have seen that the potential does not affect the power of the conducting system to
influence the luminous discharge ; nor, as we have also 8een, would mere fluctuations
of potential in the wire produce any other than the relief-effect, or interfere with or
destroy it, unless they were of like period with the pulsations in the tube. Hence the
special effect in question must be due to the fact that connexion with the air-spark
terminal interferes in a special manner with the electrical state of the tinfoil, and the
peculiarity must consist in the fact that the period of the charges (and consequent
variations of potential) is such that they keep time with the pulsations in the tube.
