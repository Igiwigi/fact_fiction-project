For example, aggregation of unicellular organisms is not
a major transition, but the constitution of liquid tissues, which
affords the possibility of evolving multilayered and hollow
embryos, is. Alteration of the physical state of tissues by
secretion and deposition of ECMs qualitatively extends even
further morphological variation and the capacity to construct
novel two- and three-layered body plans and organ forms,
with exo- and endoskeletons. Finally, in a major transition in
the jawed vertebrates, the skeletal nodules, rods and plates of
fins engendered the stereotypical proximodistally increasing
array of elements of tetrapod limbs only when the earlier-
evolved skeletogenic activators came under the control of one
or another biogeneric reaction—diffusion mechanism.

2. ‘Liquid tissues’ and the first animals

Animal embryos attain multicellularity when cells that are
clonally derived from a zygote—a fertilized egg—remain
attached to one another by one or more members of the cad-
herin family of integral membrane proteins. (The name
‘cadherin’ reflects the fact that these proteins require sufficient
levels of extracellular calcium ions for them to serve as cell
adhesion molecules (CAMs) [12]). The cell-adhesive factors
that mediate cell aggregation in non-metazoan holozoans,
however, differ from those used by animal embryos. Monosiga brevicollis and Salpingoeca rosetta, members of Choa-
noflagellata (the non-metazoan holozoans most closely
related to the animals), contain several genes that specify pro-
teins called protocadherins [13].
