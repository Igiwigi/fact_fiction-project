Primary cultures of neurons, astrocytes and microglia isolated from rodents
have also been used but these primary cells have issues of their own, as they
are often difficult to maintain and expand in culture, particularly when isolated
from an aged animal. The problems associated with these approaches highlight
a need for human cells, which can be grown in vitro while behaving as they do
in vivo. An alternative route to disease modelling has used model organisms.
Rodents are the traditional model organism of choice for CNS research, where
the animals are genetically modified in order to induce the disease of interest;
for example, the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) over
expresses amyloid precursor protein, resulting in the characteristic amyloid path-
ology and cognitive impairment associated with AD [3]. The mouse is the most
prevalent animal model used in research today, despite the fact that there are
many differences between mice and humans both genetically and phenotypically,
e.g. heart size and resting heart rate [1]. In terms of evolution the rat is 4—5 million
years closer to humans compared to mice [4] and is commonly used as the main
model organism in Parkinson’s disease (PD) research. Although these model
organisms have contributed to elucidating key pathological mechanisms, the
use of non-human models of a human disease is inherently flawed given that
rodents do not naturally develop many disorders of the CNS [5]. This has resulted
in difficulties translating therapies developed in rodent models into feasible thera-
pies as therapeutics viable in one species may be detrimental in the other [6,7].
