be exceeded in a preparation from a recent Fern, The small celled, thin-walled tissue
constituting the phloém is absolutely perfect and completely surrounds the V-shaped
xylem. The maximum thickness of the phloém-zone is found on the convex or
morphologically lower side of the bundle ; it thins out somewhat at the lateral angles, |
and again attains a considerable thickness on the concave upper face. The larger
thin-walled cells bordering on the cortex are best regarded as pericycle. Neither
here nor in any other specimen, do we find any differentiated bundle-sheath or
epidermis ; considering the perfection of the preservation we are probably justified in
concluding that in Lyginodendron, as in the Marattiaces of the present day, a
specialized endodermis was not developed. Secretory sacs are scattered among the
phloém-elements.

Every well-preserved transverse section of a petiole shows the same fact, that the
bundle was concentric Where two bundles are present, as usually happens in main
petioles, and sometimes in their secondary branches, each bundle is surrounded by its
own zone of phloém, except where the two are on the point of fusing (ef. Memoir —
XVIL, Plate 13, fig. 2). Longitudinal sections confirm these conclusions.t |

The position of the spiral tracheides or protoxylem in the petiolar bundle is not
always easy to determine in the transverse sections, but with the help of the longi-
tudinal sections this can be done. There were always several such groups. Thus,
in the specimen shown in photograph 5, there were certainly three, one near the
