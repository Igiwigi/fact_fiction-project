The three fixation points appear to lie at the corners of an imaginary
right-angled triangle with the right angle forming the apex. The green fixation point
corresponds to the apex, the red one corresponds to the left-hand end of the base, while the
blue one corresponds to its right-hand end. Leaving out of account the fact that the green
fixation point lies above the other two, the order of the points, travelling in a horizontal
line in a nasal direction are: red, green and blue, in the case of the left eye. In the case of
the right eye they are in the reverse order, namely, blue, green and red. This reversal
makes it impossible for the order in both eyes to be due either to the decentred lens which
was used in these experiments, or to uncorrected chromatic difference of magnification.
