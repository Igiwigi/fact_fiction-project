The maximum and minimum quantities of
carbonic acid were 6:52 grs. and 7:44 grs. ; of air inspired, 399 cubic inches and 341
cubic inches; rate of respiration 12 and 10-2, and rate of pulsation 71 and 58 per minute
—quantities which contrast in a remarkable manner with those previously shown to
occur with food. In Plate XXXII1. fig. 1, the variations with and without food are con-
trasted. Hence there is great uniformity in the respiratory phenomena during a long fast ; but
it was noticeable that on the occasions when the carbonic acid would have increased with
food, there was a slight decrease without food—a fact corresponding with that which T
recorded in the Transactions of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society for 1856, in
the rate of the functions on five persons of different sexes and ages. A low and uniform
state of system is therefore the characteristic condition in a prolonged fast; and it is
very like that which occurs with food at the end of the interval between the meals. It
has also been shown that in a fast of this duration the quantity of carbonic acid does
not progressively diminish, but is the same at the end of twenty-seven hours as it was
at the end of 44 hours.
