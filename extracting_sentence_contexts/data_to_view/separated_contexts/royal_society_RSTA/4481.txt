An understanding of the history of those contrarian activities


is valuable to understand—and ultimately counteract—similar efforts currently underway with
respect to climate change. Beyond their ability to forestall regulatory actions, uncertainty-based campaigns can have
further psychological, cognitive and political implications that have largely escaped notice to
date. In fact, we suggest that those largely overlooked consequences of uncertainty may be at
least as harmful as the more overt political consequences analysed by Oreskes in this issue and
others (e.g. [40,41]). At a cognitive level, recent research has shown that people’s perception of probabilistic
information is determined in part by their motivations. Specifically, when people are motivated
to arrive at a particular outcome, they detect more variance in probabilistic information.
