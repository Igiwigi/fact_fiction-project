in accordance with the theorem.

I had at first some difficulty to perceive the reason why some of the arcs were to
be considered negative rather than the others. This question was one of a novel
nature, which had not hitherto occurred to analysts, and therefore no solution of it
was to be met with in books. On the other hand, to leave 80 essential a point with-
out any demonstration was unsatisfactory. But the following considerations appeared
to afford an explanation of this fact.

In the first example, since x + y + 2 = 0,-and both - and y are positive quantities,
z must be negative. Therefore y is positive, but » 2 and y z are negative.

Now we have
92 __ M1 +a*—1
Sn. 4 Za
which therefore must be negative: .*. also \/1 +2*—1 must be negative. But this
quantity would necessarily be positive if the radical had a positive sign. Therefore

the radical must have a negative sign.
