Proceeding in the same way, we eventually get a countable subset {x1,x2,x3,..-}
of X. This ‘proof’ is short and crystal clear. This is why colleagues in Analysis used to overreact
when challenged by the simple fact that in this form, without additional assumptions, the proof is
completely wrong—as are most other naive arguments using ’...’ in similar sloppy fashion. What this argument does indeed prove is that X contains an arbitrarily large finite subset
{x1,...,Xn}, which is called mathematical induction. Using some form of the axiom of choice, one
can within another quarter of a page derive that X contains a countable subset.
