She cannot wait until all fluctuations die. Therefore the approximation for sufficiently large T is
used: pwiw Â© pwiw(T). Such T is determined from the condition of diminishing fluctuations of the matrix elements (in
fact, fluctuations of the probability pwiw(t). We remark that figures 3-6 represent only the rough
picture of the behaviour of matrix elements. By using a finer time scale, we would see a variety of
small spikes on the basic curves of these figures).
