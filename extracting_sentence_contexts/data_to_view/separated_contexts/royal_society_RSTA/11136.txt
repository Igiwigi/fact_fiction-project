Trans.,’ vol. 160, p. 333, 1870), showed that when
the more refrangible rays from an are lamp, such as were able to traverse blue glass but
not red glass, were concentrated within a tube containing air mixed with amyl-nitrite
or certain other vapours, dense clouds were produced. He was unable to obtain any
such effect with pure air and water only. The experiments to be described differ in
no essential respect from his, except in the fact that the rays from the are lamp were
allowed to traverse no material such as glass, which is opaque to the ultra-violet rays,
before entering the tube containing the moist air. Under these conditions, air con-
taining water vapour only, shows the phenomena that were observed by ‘TyNDALL
with other vapours. I have found the apparatus shown in fig. 5 convenient for experiments on this
