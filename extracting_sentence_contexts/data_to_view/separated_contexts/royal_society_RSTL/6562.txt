About this point the rate of diminution is reduced, and the transpiration-time
ven becomes stationary for a short portion of the range of hydration. The retardation
served appears to coincide with the formation of a 12-hydrate of hydrochloric acid. e existence of such a compound is further supported by the fact that solutions of
yarochloric acid tend to the same composition by evaporation at the atmospheric tem-
FJerature, The degree of hydration of most stability at high temperatures, and having
Jhe highest boiling-point, is known to be at or near the proportion of the 16-hydrate. e existence, however, of the latter hydrate, at the ordinary temperature, is not sup-
orted by the transpiration experiments now recorded, conducted as these were at a low
