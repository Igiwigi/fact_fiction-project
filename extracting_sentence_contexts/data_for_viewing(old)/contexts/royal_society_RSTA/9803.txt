D, and D, lines (more accurately determined) do not agree with the observed D,
satellites. It would therefore appear that the second and third members of. the
triplets may also be subject to special displacements. Here, for instance, the lines of
order 3 are brought into line if the observed VD,, (3) is VD,, (3) (—d,). The value of
D,;(4), calculated from K.R.’s D,,(4), cannot be the normal one, even when his
extreme possible error is allowed. ‘This shows again that VD,, (4) must be displaced
from VD,,;(4), in this case by 104,.

The denominator for m = 6 shows the sudden large rise after a slow change which
Zn also exhibits, but it cannot be explained, as in that case, by treating it as a
collateral due to a modification of D() alone. The closest collateral of this type
would be due to 6, and this changes D() by 5°66 producing in the denominator
a change too far in the opposite direction. In fact it becomes 6°912000, 3471 below

that of m= 5 in place of 5060 above. But the observation error in this line ig so
large that as it stands it may correspond really to a denominator equal to that of
m= 5. If further the series of differences 750,, 310,, 120,, be continued diminishing
further as looks probable, it would come more nearly in line. For instance, as each
term is about “4 the previous, suppose the next is 50, = 569. The value of D, (6) as
thus calculated differs from the observed by —'19 while the possible error is ‘30.
This would make the constancy of the denominator begin at an order one higher than
in Zn. The case of Hg will be seen to support this tendency.
