Therefore, to differentiate between the
‘objective’ and ‘subjective’ mode of application of LI, we will refer to the plausibility as ‘inference-
probability’ or ‘i-prob’ for short. A more extensive discussion and arguments for distinguishing
between plausibility, inference probability and Kolmogorov probability can be found in [22]. For
the purpose of the present review, it is sufficient if the reader does not think of the i-prob as a
frequency or probability in the traditional mathematical sense but merely as a numerical measure
for the fact that proposition A is true, given that proposition B is true. In real experiments, there is always uncertainty about some factors which may or may
not influence the outcome of the measurements: it is presumptuous to assume that we know
‘everything’ about these factors. In particular, if experiment shows that (a) there is uncertainty
about each individual event and (b) the conditions under which the experiment is carried out are
also subject to uncertainties, then the data collected in such an experiment cannot be described
by the traditional theories of classical physics, the reason being that the theoretical description of
‘classical physics’ assumes that there is absolute certainty about the outcome of each individual
experiment on each individual object.
