possible. For the result may be extended in the same way to a law compounded of
three, when further measurements are made. It is not thought necessary to reproduce
the calculations to this effect. The conclusion, therefore, appears inevitable that the
details of the shape, and even the general form, of the curve H.,, are not compatible
with the view that H, contains only one component broadened, perhaps by various
agencies, simultaneously by any physically possible exponential laws, the total
argument of the exponential being additive in the complete law. We are compelled
to seek an explanation of the curve in terms of several components whose individual
curves are superposed, and are led directly to the Stark effect as the foundation of the
whole phenomenon. Several qualitative reasons have already been advanced in favour
of this hypothesis, and it now appears further that a quantitative study of the curves
necessitates the same hypothesis. For if several components are to be admitted, only
the Stark effect seems capable of providing them, and the fact that they must be
symmetrical in H, enhances this conclusion. ‘The components are conspicuous in H8

and some other cases, but in H, a closer scrutiny is required to reveal them. In order
to cover such cases the theoretical discussion has been made somewhat complete.

If H, has close components, the law of attenuation of each component from its
