Principle 2.1. The physically realizable states of a system have the same construction in both
time and space. Any differences between space and time, such as dynamics and conservation
laws, emerge phenomenologically.

The important point here is that it allows a physical system to be represented as being localized
in both space and time. The kinds of systems being considered could be any system describable
in conventional quantum mechanics. Allowing localization in time rules out the possibility of
incorporating equations of motion and conservations laws at a fundamental level of the theory.

Next, we note that the generators of translations in time and space are given by the
Hamiltonian H and the momentum operators P, respectively. They are distinguished by the
discrete symmetries of charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P) and time reversal (T) in
the sense that only the temporal generator expresses violations of the symmetries. In fact, the
violations are only seen in the time evolution of various particle decays and thus in translations
over time. This suggests that the discrete symmetry violations may provide a phenomenological
basis for the kind of time-space asymmetry needed for dynamics to emerge in accord with
principle 2.1. In particular, if H represents the Hamiltonian for evolving into the future, then the
Hamiltonian for the time-reversed evolution into the past is 7-!'HT where T is Wigner’s time
reversal operator [15]. For brevity, we use a special symbol for each version of the Hamiltonian,
namely

Ap=A and Ag=7~'AT, (2.1)

where the subscripts ‘F’ and ‘B’ represent the ‘forwards’ (or positive t) and ‘backwards’ (negative
t) directions of time evolution, respectively. T violation is represented by
