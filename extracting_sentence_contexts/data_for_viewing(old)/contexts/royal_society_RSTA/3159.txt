the stability of the pinned pulse solutions can be computed explicitly and the computations are
drastically simpler than the technical Evans function computations for slow-fast RDEs ([24],
e.g.). So, (1.3) could, for instance, easily be used as a starting point—and organizing centre—for
understanding complex, or maybe even chaotic, pulse dynamics ([25,26], e.g.).

Remark 1.1. The present work distinguishes itself in two ways from the existing literature on
the impact of strongly localized impurities on the dynamics of evolutionary PDEs ([5,10,12,14,18],
e.g.). Firstly, our approach is developed in the setting of a general class of RDEs, while all the
literature we are aware of is focused on specific models (see also the discussion in §4). Secondly,
the present analysis is valid for ¢ > 0 (but sufficiently small), i.e. for (more) realistic impurities
of the type (1.1) that only become of Dirac delta-functions in the singular limit ¢ > 0. In other
words, the current analysis extends the singular limit approach—with Dirac delta-function-
type impurities—of the large majority of the literature (see, however, also [17,18]). In fact, our
approach may serve as a (geometric) framework by which results presented in the literature may
be rigorously validated and extended beyond the Dirac delta-function limit to impurities of the
type (1.1).

(a) Results and outlook

The strong localization of the nonlinearities in (1.3) allows us to develop a general geometrical
singular perturbation framework to study the existence, stability and bifurcations of these pinned
pulse solutions supported by (1.3). More specifically, (1.3) is to leading order linear away from
the impurities and it can thus be solved—to leading order—explicitly in these slow regions. The
nonlinearities G; of the strongly localized impurities are then used to construct pinned pulse
solutions by appropriately concatenating the different slow parts over the fast regions. Also, by
