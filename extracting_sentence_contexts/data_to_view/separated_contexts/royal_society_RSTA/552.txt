apart by lines of alternate dots and dashes. The small black
circles on all these lines indicate the computed values. The regularity of R, is due to the fact that the values, except for R,,, have been calculated
from the values of D,, and therefore approximately represent the values that would be
obtained with all possible block boundaries. In blocks of 16, for example, the mean squares
vary from 890 to 1310 according to the choice of block boundary, the mean being 1080,
compared with the value of 1110 from D,. Various points are apparent from the figure.
