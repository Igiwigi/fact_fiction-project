Here we highlight recent advances in RL methods ‘parametric’ nature—e.g. the value of initial growth rate r in a

spaces, imperfect models and lack of accurate simulators— for a structurally flexible enough model to represent both families
that have prevented adaptive management from moving of curves in terms of the choice of some additional parameters. In

fact, the deep neural networks underlying most of modern machine
learning including RL-based methods owe their success to being pre-
cisely such highly flexible function approximators. The key
