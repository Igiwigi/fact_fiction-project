Naively, a quantum field theory is described by
a path integral over a space of classical fields. However, many phenomena such
as duality symmetries are not readily explained within that framework. In fact,
it is well known in physics that a single theory can have various weakly coupled
descriptions in terms of very different sets of fields. Even fundamental properties
such as the gauge group are not invariant. Other ‘quantum results’ involve seeing structure in algebraic topology by
packaging cohomology groups of related spaces together.
