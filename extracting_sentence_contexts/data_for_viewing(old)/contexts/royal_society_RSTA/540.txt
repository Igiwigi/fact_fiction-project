For the first term Ix, we have that

Using estimate (2.1), we deduce that the first term on the right-hand side goes to 0 as k > +00.
From the local strong convergence of W, towards Woo, the second term on the right-hand side
converges to 0 too. We conclude that limy_, +50 1; = 0. Moreover, it has been proved in lemma 2.2,
see equation (2.10), that limy_, 4.0 I, =0. For the last term, we have, using the fact that W is
bounded in L®, that, for some non-negative constant C,

Ik < Cf yrzpa 2 = Up. >o}) + 1 = Upp pn /2))1p.>0}) a.

We have shown in the fourth step above that Uppy>py/2) converges weakly towards 1p.>0}- Then
passing to the limit k > +00 in the latter inequality, we deduce that limy_, +55 I, =0. We conclude
from (2.27) that, for any open bounded subset U,

By uniqueness of the weak limit, we deduce that poo = H(Woo)1p,,>0) a.
Sixth step. Derivation of (2.12). From definition (2.18), this limit is now a consequence of
