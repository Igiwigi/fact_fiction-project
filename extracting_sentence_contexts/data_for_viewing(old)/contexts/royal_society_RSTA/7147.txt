the commutativity relations are again not listed, but only the additional defining relations.
The intersections three at a time and the intersection of all four constituent groups are all
the same group, namely, {a}.

The canonic group
P' ={a',b',c',d',u’v’s Be! =a'w’,c'd’"' =u", d'b') = 0'-}
can be generated also by a’, b', c’, d’; they are permutable in pairs, as each pair belongs to
at least one constituent group, hence P’ is Abelian, and can serve also as the group we
denoted by P*. Now in P’
1=8'c'.¢d'.d'b'! =a'u' uy’ vl =a.

Thus the canonic mapping # maps the element a+1 of the amalgam on to aJ =a’ = 1;
hence @ is not one-to-one and the amalgam is not embeddable in a group. In fact @ acts as
a proper homomorphism on each constituent group, that is, it lacks the isomorphism pro-

perty. On the other hand, one easily verifies that P’ is the free Abelian group generated by
b,c’, d’; and the groups which correspond to the G, are

Gi ={',c}, Gl={e',d}, Gy={d',b'},
; . ee ey MU Meee Hc

They intersect in pairs in

70 G = {c'}, 719 Gs = {b},
