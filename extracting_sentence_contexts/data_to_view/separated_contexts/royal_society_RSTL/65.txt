Aſcent of the Water in them) is greater and greater,
and is, moſt demonſtrable by the Experiments of rhs
Plancs ; for their inward Ares being always the lame,
{q char as they are placed nearer and nearer to each other,
the Cavity or Space- between them becomes leſs and
le6, and conſequently the Diſproportions are increaſed,
whereby the Power of their Attraction is augmented. EXPERIMEN T Iv. This Experiment T take to be very Analogous to thoſe
lately made on_ the ſeeming ſpontaneous Aſcent of
Water between Glaſs, Marble, and Braſs Planes, as al-
{o with thoſe madein Capillary*Tubes ; ſince it ſeems to
proceed from the fame Principle, and ſubject to the ſame
Laws, as appears by matter of Fact ; which take as fol-
lows. I tooka Glaſs Tube about 32 Inches long, the
Diameter of its Cavity near three quarters of an Inch:
This, when T had'ty*d a Piece of Linnen Cloth at one
end, (to prevent the Aſhes from falling out) I proceed-
* ed to fill with Aſhes at the others the Aſhes were ſifted
chro' a pretty fine Searſe, Atevery {mall Portion I put
in, I ramm'd them ſtrongly down with' a Rammer,
whoſe Baſis was very little leſs than the Bore of the
Tube; by which means, T laid, or rather crouded them
as cloſe together as poſſible.
