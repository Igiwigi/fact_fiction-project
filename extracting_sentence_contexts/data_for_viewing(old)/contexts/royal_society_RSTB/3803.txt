forming above and below the pit a ‘‘bogenférmige Linie.” The primordial pit may
enclose two adult pits in stem wood and even more in root wood (p. 79).

This is all the information on the character of the bars of Sanio in the different
regions of the individual plant that I have been able to find. Miss Grrry’s article
(1910) referred to in Section 4b deals with the occurrence of the bars of Sanio in the
different groups of the Conifers, but does not attempt a regional study of an individual
to gain the phylogenetic evidence from this source. 1 have. examined the cone axis,
root and stem wood of the adult and seedling of various forms of the Abietinee, etc.,
and find that the thickening of the primary wall described by Santo is always found
in the primitive regions of the plant in intimate association with the pit. It is very
small in these regions as compared with its condition in later root and stem wood.
In fact, where the pits are multi-seriate, as in young root wood, there may not be a
trace of the bar of Sanio (fig. 36a, Plate 4). Ina stage toward the adult condition
these bars connect horizontally, extending beyond the pits themselves and connecting
between the series of pits by mere traces at first (fig. 36¢, Plate 4), which later become
as thick or even thicker than the original parts. Finally, the bars may become quite
separated from the pits, as is the typical condition for the adult wood. It is thus seen
that the bar of Sanio is a very much smaller structure in the early formed wood, and that
in addition it is closely related to the pits. In Pityoxylon of the Cretaceous the bar of
Sanio occurs in contact with the pits also and scarcely extends beyond them (fig. 42,
Plate 4). It is quite comparable in this respect to that occurring in the cone and the
young root and stem of the Abietineze of to-day. ‘That the bar of Sanio was relatively
small and closely associated with the pits in its primary form is thus sufficiently
evident.
