Meso-scale approximations have also been shown to be effective in modelling the response
of elastic solids with rigid and free clouds of impurities [48,49], low frequency acoustic
problems involving rigid defect clusters [50] and steady-state heat conduction in densely
packed composites [51]. The approximations have also proven to be useful in modelling flows
involving fluids interacting with many small obstacles within narrow spaces [52], important for

understanding CO2-sequestration processes. : =

More recently, meso-scale approximations have been produced to model vibration in both : =
finite or infinite membranes containing clusters of rigid movable masses distributed along :B
a contour [53]. There, the scheme developed uses functions acting as solutions to suitable : =
model problems of the Helmholtz operator, moving away from the low-frequency boundary ZR
layers previously applied in [29,30,50]. In fact, this provides a way to address modes at higher : oS
frequencies, which we demonstrate here in modifying the approach of [53] to develop asymptotic :8
models for in-plane elastodynamic problems for densely perforated media. :8

In §2, we describe the problem for in-plane vibration modes of a finite elastic medium : S
containing many inclusions. Sections 3 and 4 are dedicated to developing an approximation 1S

for eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the elastic body and serve to introduce the model
problems used and to develop the associated asymptotic algorithm, respectively. Numerical
simulations demonstrating the efficiency of the asymptotic approach of §4 are then given in
§5 for elastic solids containing a range of configurations of perforations. These illustrations
use Green’s tensor for the interior of the disc, presented in electronic supplementary material,
appendix A. Further examples of the effectiveness of the approach are also given in electronic
