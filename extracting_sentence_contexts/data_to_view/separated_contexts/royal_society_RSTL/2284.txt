Now it is well known that during deve-
lopment there is a tendency in nerves to approach and unite with each other, the
lateral cords and ganglia are more closely approximated, and the ganglia in the ante-
rior part of the body approach and coalesce into one mass. But instead of all the
transyerse nerves uniting with the neryes from the ganglia, which, had they been
simple nerves of motion, we should expect they would have done, we find them in
the abdomen, carried forwards in the segments, and distributed separately to the
same muscles as those from the ganglia. Another striking fact indicative of their separate function is their being distributed
largely, even in the larya, to the double rooted nerves for the future wings,.and but
Slightly, s0 far as can be discovered, to the primary organs of locomotion, the legs. The nerves to the legs come directly from the gangliated cords, and communicate

both the motor and sensitive influence ; the legs themselves are but little concerned
in the function of respiration, and consequently are but tightly supplied with neryes
from the superadded series.
