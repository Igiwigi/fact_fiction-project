52 SIR B. C. BRODIE ON THE CALCULUS OF -CHEMICAL OPERATIONS.

system of combinations constructed upon hypothesis « does not include those pretended
compounds of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, chlorine (recognized as possible compounds of
these elements in the other system) in the case of which the &wm of the units of
hydrogen, chlorine. . . (and generally the sum of the units of the dyad elements) formed
by the decomposition of two units of the compound is other than an even number.
Hypothesis « affords no means of manufacturing these compounds; 80 that we are led
to the conclusion that 8nch things are to be regarded as mere © non-entities” or © mon-
strosities,” combinations of incompatible ingredients, which cannot be made up, by any
known chemical operations, of the Mftter of those actual chemical elements out. of
which all known chemical existences are constructed*. Tt is hardly necessary to
observe that such things cannot, as a matter of fact, be made—the limitation intro-
duced by hypothesis « being the celebrated law of Eyen Numbers, discovered as an
empirical truth by LaurExvT and GERHARDT, which is here referred to its origin, and
deductively established, as a consequence of this hypothesis.

Were we to proceed to enumerate the combinations of hydrogen, chlorine, nitrogen,
and the other dyad elements, as indicated by the two hypotheses respectively, and com-
pare the systems thus indicated with the systems actually existing, we should find that
the combinations indicated in the case of hypothesis a* were twice as numerous as in the
case of hypothesis « ; and we should, in fact, on this hypothesis (a?) make a blunder in
every alternate statement, knowing neither more nor less about the result than we do in
tossing a halfpenny whether it will fall head or tail—a position very different to that of
one who, having obtained information that the coin is weighted, never makes any 8uch
