commenced the shedding of the skin,—or without our being able to gain the least idea
how © the members, from being natatory and cleft (as shall shortly be shown), be-
come simple and adapted to crawling only.” But Mr. Taomeson has omitted to
fulfill this promise, which, if it mean anything, must be understood as an assertion
that the two pairs of natatory and cleft legs are transformed into five pairs of simple
crawling legs.

2. The appearance of these limbs (represented as perfectly disengaged in Mr.
TromesoN's Plate IT. fig. 11.) previous to the shedding of the cephalothoracic shield
and anterior parts of the body, is totally at variance with the principles of ecdysis
observable throughout the Annulosa, in which the locomotive organs, at least the
legs, are the last which are disengaged, and the thoracic shield of the inclosed animal
the first portion exposed to view. It would, in fact, be impossible for the Zoe to
disengage the thoracic limbs without the thorax itself being previously withdrawn
from its covering.

3. But we will look more precisely at the nature of this supposed disengagement
of the five pairs of legs. This, in the absence of any precise explanation given by
Mr. Taomrsox, may be presumed to be effected in three different ways.

Firstly,—as indeed Mr. TxomesoNn appears to suppose by his statement that the large
natatory limbs © become” simple ones,—this may be effected by the two pairs of large
natatory limbs entirely throwing away their outer covering, whereby the five pairs of
small simple legs, which had been previously inclosed within them, are disengaged.
This I take to be the true nature of the disengagement of the organs of motion in
