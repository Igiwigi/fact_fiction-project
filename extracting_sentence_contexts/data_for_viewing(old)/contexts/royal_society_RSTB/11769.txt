In the light of these findings, the fact that dIPFC acti-
vation disappeared in Frassle et al.’s passive viewing
condition [111] does not necessarily mean that the content
of the subjects’ experiences were not cognitively accessed,
as relevant information maintenance—and in the light of
the Barbey et al. study [90], even monitoring—could have
occurred without dIPFC activity.

(c) Diminished P3b signal and cognitive access
Although in the access versus no-access literature, the P3b
signal is linked to fronto-parietal activity [55], its neural
generators are, in fact, debated. Some localize the source
of the P3b signal to parietal-temporal regions [136],
others suggest that it is generated by activity in the
superior parietal lobule and the posterior part of the cingu-
late gyrus [137]. Wronka et al. [137] argue that the P3b
signal is related to activation of a posterior network reflect-
ing a comparison of the neuronal model of perceived
stimulation with the attentional trace. Given this interpret-
ation, Pitts et al.’s findings [107,108] imply that diverting
attention disrupts such monitoring functions. Nevertheless,
these findings might still be compatible with cognitive access
via simple information maintenance not requiring monitoring
or manipulation.
