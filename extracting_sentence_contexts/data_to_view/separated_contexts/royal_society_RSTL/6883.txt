profeſſion, to be attended with confiderable danger
to the patient ; and with the greateſt reaſon, ſince
they have been convinced from much experience,
that theſe maladies are too often the conſequences of
depraved habits of body, ariſing from ſcrophulous,
ſcorbutic, or ſome other general cauſe. But tho'
we are ſufficiently apprized of theſe facts, and that
they too often baffle the greateſt {kill in phyſic and
ſurgery, we are nevertheleſs not to infer from hence,
that cvery..diſorder of this kind is attended with the
like bad circumſtances ; fince it is well enough
known to the experienced, that diſcaſes of the joints,
particularly thoſe of the knee, are ſometimes merely
local complaints, which may not only be affiſted by
ſurgery, but perfe&ly cured. Theſe ſpecies of tu-
mors I now hint at, are thoſe, which are diftin-
guiſhed by the name of hydrops articuli, or the
dropſy of the joint ; of which there are, as I have
often obſerved, two different kinds. The one, wherein
the diſeaſe is ſituated in the membrana adipoſa, and
neighbouring parts on this fide the capſular liga-
ment. 'The other is that ſpecies of diſeaſe, wherein the
fluid is contained within the capſular ligament, be-
twixt the extremities of | the thigh-bone, and the
largeſt bone of the leg.
