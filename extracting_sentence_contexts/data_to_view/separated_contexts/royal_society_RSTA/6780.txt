To these values we fit a curve in even harmonics
of the form of the first V terms of the expansion (10). Knowing all the values at one time,
we proceed to the next step in time, using in our equations the particular values of [8R/60]
obtained from the curve fitting to R. We have not, in fact, so far attempted a two-fluid problem, but we have carried through
the process described above for the case of a single fluid in vacuo. The number of simultaneous

equations to be solved in each step is 2N for the case of a single fluid, and we have used
N= 4and N= 5 inspecial examples.
