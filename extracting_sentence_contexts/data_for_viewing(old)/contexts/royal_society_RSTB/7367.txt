When Granit investigated the retinae of such animals as frogs and snakes, he found two
types of receptor in the light-adapted eye: receptors with a narrow spectral response, which
he called ‘modulators’, and receptors with a broad response, which he called ‘dominators’.
He observed that the shape of the dominator curve is extremely like, if it is not identical
with, the luminosity curve of the human light-adapted eye. Since dominators were not
found to be present in the eyes of rats or guinea-pigs, which are stated to be devoid of cones,
he concluded that cones are essential elements for the existence of dominators. When, later,
he investigated the retinae of cats, these ideas were confirmed ; he found, moreover, in these
animals that the photopic dominators gave a response with a hump at about 6000A, very
alike in shape to that found by Wright when a small foveal patch, of 20 min. of arc, is
investigated in the human eye.

Granit found several other facts concerning dominators. First, that by selected adapta-
tion a dominator can apparently be split into the individual modulators which compose
it. Further, that it was possible to synthesize the human photopic luminosity curve, on the
basis of three fundamental sensation curves: blue, green and red, the latter being made up
of two modulators, MY and MR. With regard to the number of dominators present, Granit
stated that about 36 % of the fibres which were isolated by his method in the light-adapted
cat’s eye, gave the dominator response. Presumably the remaining fibres gave a response
of the modulator type, that is, there was evidence that they were connected to receptors
with a narrow spectral response.

This idea that the dominator is composite, being built up of several modulators, all
connected with the same nerve fibre, agrees with the work of Polyak, who described both
rods and cones converging on the same optic nerve fibre. It is not, however, in agreement
