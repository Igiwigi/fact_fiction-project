MR. HORNER ON THE ALLUVIAL LAND OF EGYPT. 89

HEKEKYAN BÃžy, in his anxiety to fulfil my instructions that every variety of the allu-
vial 80il passed through in the pits should be noticed, carefully distinguished minute
differences in composition and colour, and sent specimens of all the varieties he de-
scribed. Although there are in fact only two classes, what may be termed loams and
sands, T have thought it advisable to preserve in the s8ections HEKEKYAN Bey's minute
distinctions. I have added to the above Table the local names which he has supplied. as they may prove useful, should future geologists, directing their attention, as I trust
they will do, to the same subject, chance to see this memoir.
