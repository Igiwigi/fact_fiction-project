The comparison between A. and C. in the upper of the above Tables confirms the
results of the previous blinding experiments, showing that no sense-organ in the head
can possess the property of being influenced by light in such a manner as to direct the
formation of colour in the pupa. Conversely, the results strongly favour the view,
and, in fact, confirmed as they are by other experiments, render the conclusion certain,
that such a power is possessed by some terminal organ in the skin or by some one
of its elements without the intervention of the nervous system. The former is the
more probable hypothesis, for, if otherwise, we should expect to find diversely coloured
pupe corresponding to the different colours in the immediate surroundings, but I do
not regard this argument as convincing ; and the investigation of the structural basis,
and the nature of the physiological processes which take place, afford a subject for
research which promises results as interesting as the work itself will be difficult. The

upper and more trustworthy analysis, although depending on insufficient data, further
supports the conclusion that the influence acts upon the skin by showing preponde-
rating effects from the colour to which the larger area of skin has been exposed ; and
the differences are small, both between the effects wrought in the pups and between
the two areas of skin affected by opposite stimuli.
