On the application of an increment of load this stress concentration will increase
By a small amount, causing a tendency for the Liiders lines to penetrate further into the
Gastic core of the beam until equilibrium is again attained. If all the Liiders lines were of
@ual size, it might be supposed that there was an equal probability of each one completing
i further penetration in any given interval of time, and in this case the relation between
the overall change of curvature and time would be of exponential form. In actual fact the
Geep observations cannot be fitted exactly by curves of exponential form, and the dis-
@epancy may be ascribed to the fact that the Liiders lines vary widely in size.

"2 The test-pieces used in this be ema work were nominally of }in. diameter cross-
tion, faired at their ends by radii into $in. diameter ends on which 1 in. of B.S.F. thread

2 The steel was drawn from the same stock as used for the test-pieces of rectangular cross-
Rection, described in ยง 7, and the test-pieces were subjected to a similar heat treatment after
machining and final grinding.
