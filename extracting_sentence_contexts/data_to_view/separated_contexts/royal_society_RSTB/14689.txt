Goedert and prepared by R.W.B. from cal-
careous siltstone nodules at CCNHM using 10% acetic acid. Xenorophidst and other fossil odontocetes from the Oligocene
Ashley and Chandler Bridge formations of South Carolina
(USA) were studied in CCNHM and ChM collections, and
discovered by a number of different individuals.

(c) Sampling

We focused on species represented by multiple individuals and a
range of ontogenetic stages, including fetuses and neonates. This
seemed particularly important given the substantial intraspecific


variation in the interparietal within some mammalian species
[23-26] and the fact that its presence can be more readily recog-
nized in younger individuals that have unfused sutures [15]. Unfortunately, only a few extant cetacean species meet these
criteria, and they are all within a single clade, Delphinoidea. Somewhat surprisingly, one of the oldest and most archaic
fossil odontocetes, Olympicetus avitust, met these criteria.
