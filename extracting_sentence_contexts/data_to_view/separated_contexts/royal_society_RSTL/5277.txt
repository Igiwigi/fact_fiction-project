These theorems will suffice. There would be little difficulty in extending the list. In fact nearly all the projective properties of right lines and conic sections on a plane
may be transformed into analogous properties of great circles and spherical conic
sections on the surface of a sphere, and of parabolic arcs and logarithmic sections on
the surface of a paraboloid. SecrIoN XII.â€”On the Rectification of the Lemniscates. LXXXIX.
