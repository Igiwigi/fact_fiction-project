Since Weap (5-11) is polyconvex, the
corresponding energy is weakly lower semicontinuous. Hence Ecap(, €) = infy,y)cA, Ecap(p, 9). The absolute continuity of p() is an immediate consequence of the fact that peH ¢*,% Es
Reversing the change of variables (5.9) the result applies to the energy in the form (5.7). The
conclusions can be immediately applied to the problem in Af. Indeed, by the properties of the
minimizing sequences, formulated in vector form, for convenience, we have that V - nV: nf
and nj- V x nj > f- V x ni, asj > ov, hold. a

Let us now turn to the energy minimization problem under the constraints (2.3).
