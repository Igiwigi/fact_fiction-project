Although Iversen (1946) has drawn attention to the possibility of separating the pollen
of Potamogeton into the two types of the wind-pollinated and water-pollinated species, we
were unable confidently to make this separation. Substantial amounts of pollen referable
to the genus were identified in the zone II muds along with fruit stones. It is likely that the
percentages of Potamogeton pollen in the Hawks Tor series are underestimated, as the
delicate pollen is often too damaged to be certainly identified.

Ranunculus

Ranunculus pollen occurs in the lower muds at Stannon Marsh, at the base of the Parsons
Park series, throughout zones II and III of the Hawks Tor series, and on into the post-
Glacial zones. Although it is unlikely that one can in fact recognize the pollen of different
species of Ranunculus, it is interesting to note that much of this Cornish pollen appeared to
correspond with R. lingua L. Ranunculus fruits, of which one was R. flammula, were also present.
It may be noted that Iversen (1946) records late-Glacial pollen as Ranunculus cf. lingua from
Bromme, and that Jessen records R. lingua fruits from zone IT in Ireland.

Rumex

Rumex pollen has been recorded elsewhere in substantial frequencies in the late-Glacial,
so that records from zones II and III of the Hawks Tor series are not remarkable. For
macroscopic remains, see ยง 4a, p. 423.
