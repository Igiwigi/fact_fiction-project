Tus paper furnishes descriptions of certain stages in the development of the chondro-
cranium of the Common Eel (Anguilla vulgaris, Turton), and, in addition, provides a
comparative account of the chondrocranial development in Bony Fishes, and particu-
larly in the Teleosts. Since the publication of Herrwia’s* treatise on comparative
vertebrate embryology in 1906, in which the section dealing with the cranial skeleton
was written by the late Prof. Gaurr, no adequate comparative study of the fish chondro-
cranium has been undertaken ; in view of the fact that our knowledge of the subject
has been considerably augmented in recent years, an endeavour to supply this deficiency
