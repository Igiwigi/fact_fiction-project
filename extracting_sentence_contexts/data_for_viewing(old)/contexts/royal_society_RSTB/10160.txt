object generates different magnitudes of horizontal disparity response of the eyes and extra-retinal signals used to measure
depending on viewing distance. Because of this, the metric it. By vertical disparity, we mean the horizontal and vertical
structure of the environment cannot be estimated from hori- gradients of vertical disparity, which tend towards zero with

zontal disparity alone. We examined the combined effects increasing distance. By accommodation, we mean _ the


accommodative response of the eyes and extra-retinal signals
used to measure that response.

Some previous studies of stereoscopic depth constancy
have manipulated vergence and vertical-disparity signals and
most showed that both signals are in fact used [21,22,24â€”26].
To the best of our knowledge, only one has presented appropri-
ate accommodation signals and it showed that there was
indeed an effect of the accommodative stimulus [23]. None
examined the effect of the spatial frequency of depth varia-
tion on depth constancy in combination with the effect of
viewing distance.

We wanted to manipulate vergence, vertical disparity and
accommodation together, so that we could determine whether
the visual system achieves depth constancy when those signals
all specify the same distance and vary appropriately for stimuli
at different distances. To accomplish this, we used a stereo-
