For example, liquid mercury and caesium approaching their triple points are considered as
normal liquid metals with electronic properties typical of the condensed state. The remarkably
small changes of basic properties of almost all metals, such as the electrical conductivity or
magnetic susceptibility on melting [22], show that the electronic structure of the liquid metal
is indeed quite similar to that of the crystalline solid, and both liquid and solid can be reasonably
well described by the nearly free-electron approximation. This behaviour is usually rationalized
by the fact that the short-range atomic correlations and the atomic density in the liquid near
melting are closely similar to those of the crystals. Consequently, the liquid metallic phase is
usually treated as a monatomic state, which reflects the solid structure being regarded as single
screened metal ions each diffusively uncoupled from every other. In contrast to melting, however, there are substantial, qualitative changes in the very nature
of chemical bonding upon evaporation of a liquid metal.
