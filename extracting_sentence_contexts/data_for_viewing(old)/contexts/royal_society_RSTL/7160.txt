When RUnMKoRvy's large coil was discharged between two electrodes made from man-
ganese (we surrounded them with an atmosphere of hydrogen), a pure spectrum of the
8econd order, free from any traces whatever of the former spectrum, was obtained.

EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES.

In determining the different spectra both of the firs; and the second order, the
dispersing prisms occupied inyariably the same position, corresponding to the minimum
deviation of the green hydrogen-line HP, 4. e. of FRauxNHopgR's F. All spectra repre-
8ented in the Plates are referred to the three hydrogen-lines He, HB, Hy, and the
double sodium-line Na. Generally two prisms of about 60? and 45* were employed,

* This fact has been noticed by M. A. Mrrscurrrcn with regard to the chloride and the iodide, and attri-
buted by him to the undecomposed salt (Pog@zxDorey's © Annalen,” 1862, yol. ii. p. 299).

giving the distances of He and Na on one side and of Hy on the other side from HP,
by the following numbers of divisions of an arbitrary scale :

139-6, 100-5-101, 88:5,

In the first Plate portions of all the coloured spectra are represented as they appear
by making use of two additional prisms of 450.
