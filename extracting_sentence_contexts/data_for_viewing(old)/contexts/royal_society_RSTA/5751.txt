4. Conclusion 12

A theory of magnetic response of uniaxial antiferromagnetic nanoparticles at arbitrary a
temperatures is presented. It suggests that external and effective anisotropy fields are much a)
weaker than the exchange one that is typical for most measurements. Also, it is supposed that Dy
a characteristic time of the applied field changes is much larger than the decay time of the [8
precession of the sublattices magnetization vectors. In fact, this means that the theory is applicable Da
up to frequencies of several tens of kilohertz.

Within the developed framework, a special axisymmetric case, where external field is applied
strictly along the anisotropy axis of a particle, is considered in detail. Certainly, this configuration
is in a sense ideal and requires special efforts to be realized in experiment. However, the
lack of mathematical bulkiness makes it possible to bring many calculations to final formulae
which clearly reveal the influence of the spontaneous magnetic moment on the response of
AFM nanoparticles. Namely, the expressions for static and dynamic longitudinal susceptibilities
are obtained, and quasi-static magnetization curves in the low-temperature limit are described
analytically. Description of the nonlinear remagnetization of particles at finite temperatures
require numerical calculations even in this case; the obtained numerical results are in qualitative
agreement with the experimental data available in the literature. The way to extend the developed
