Vieillardi may be directly com-
pared with the central cauline xylem in the stele of Asteroxylon and Lycopodium.

6. In Tm. Vieillardi most of the scale-leaves on the transitional region of the axis
are supplied with leaf-traces, and these resemble the leaf-traces of Asteroxylon in the
fact that they stop short at the leaf-base, never entering the free portion, of the leaf.

7. In the aerial shoot of T'â€™mesipteris the phloem is not confined to a layer outside the
xylem ring, as commonly described, but more or less completely surrounds each
individual bundle of the ring. In longitudinal sections, not only in 7m.
