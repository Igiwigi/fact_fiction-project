(lymphocytes plus pyronin cells) gave a value just under the 5 % significance level
(tog = 2-034, where the 5 % P level is ¢=2-086), thus showing the slight masking effect of
including the pyronin cells.

The 8- to 12-day lymphocyte increments of the ranked graft series did not exhibit
a significant regression. However, if the three series 304h, 183h and 308h were omitted,
thus giving a ranking roughly in the order of amount of destruction undergone between
8 and 12 days, then the probability value obtained was about 1 in 19, the slope being
negative.

Again omitting these three series, the pyronin-cell counts for 8 and 12 days still showed
no sign of regression, and, what is particularly interesting, the 8- to 12-day increments
in pyronin cells showed none either. This last fact, taken in conjunction with the possible
negative regression of the lymphocyte increments, throws light on the previously noted
association between the increment in percentage of pyronin cells and the amount of graft
destruction. This association now appears likely to have been more the result of a rela-
tively smaller lymphocyte increment in the grafts undergoing most destruction rather
than a greater increase in pyronin cells. The’cell counts showed that lymphocytes actually
decreased in the grafts undergoing most destruction but increased in those undergoing
least.

t tests. No significant difference between the 8-day and the 12-day grafts in their
average count of lymphocytes, pyronin cells, or total cells, was found when ¢ tests were
applied.
