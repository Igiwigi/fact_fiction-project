These feathers yield
up a part of their colouring-matter to pure water, a beautiful rose-coloured solution
being thus obtained. Mr. TE6ETMEIER'S attention had been drawn to this fact, and he
at once perceived that it was worthy of fuller investigation than it had already received. On further inquiry, I find that Mr. Warp of Wigmore Street had noticed the evan-
escence and solubility of the red tint in question many years ago, and that other ob-
servers, within the last few years, have even sncceeded in staining pieces of paper with
the red s0lution which these feathers yield.
