vitiated to an unknown degree by differences of temperature along the muscle’s
length, and conclusions from it are of doubtful value. Most of the more reliable
work on the subject was performed on muscles excited isometrically. In the future,
however, it will be necessary, as soon as the simpler problem of the isometric contrac-
tion has been properly explored, to consider the case of muscles fulfilling their
natural, though more complicated, function of shortening ; and in that consideration
it will be necessary for the investigator to be alive to the difficulties and complications
provided by the purely physical thermal effects consequent on the shortening of an
extended elastic body.

(b) Mechanics.

In considering the mechanics of muscular contraction, the fact that all the potential
energy put into a stretched elastic body can be recovered as work only if the shorten-
ing be infinitely slow is very important. Consider first the case of a muscle passively
stretched. If the muscle be stretched from a length 7, to a length /,, and if the
tension P be required to stretch it to any length, /, then P is greater the
more rapidly the stretching is carried out. Consequently, for a given amount of
stretching (7.¢., for a given final amount of potential energy) the faster the stretching
the greater will be the work required and the more wasteful will be the process.
Similarly, if the muscle be allowed to shorten from /, to /,, doing as much work as
possible, the tension P exerted at length, /, is Jess the more rapidly the muscle is
allowed to shorten ; consequently, for a given amount of potential energy available,
the more rapidly the muscle shortens the smaller is the amount of external work
done and the more wasteful the process. What is true of the elastic properties of
