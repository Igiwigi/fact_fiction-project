10. Making use of the second of (28), we may write equation (24) in the form

* {must in fact vanish with , and {, since it must be continuous at all points in the fluid, will also vanish
at points on the line (8 = 0) which are outside the range (x. <<a <«,); but within this range { will be

34 R. V. SOUTHWELL AND H. B. SQUIRE ON A MODIFICATION

If (to fix ideas) we now give to v the value 4, so that (22)—from which the governing
equation (23) was deduced—can be written in the form

[a+5+22|c=0. (33)

we have in place of (29) the expression
