Comparing the difference between Agents’ actual trust-
worthiness (computed as percentage returned) and the
gossip describing this trustworthiness reveals that, on aver-
age, these lies were large. Just under half (47%) of lies were
positive, claiming that M = 6.39 ECU had been sent and M=
11.12 returned, when in fact M=3.73 ECU had been sent
and M=2.51 returned. A very similar proportion (49%) of
lies were negative, claiming that M=6.39 ECU had been
sent and M=2.60 returned, when in fact M=5.54 ECU had
been sent and M=7.57 returned. The remainder (4%) were
ambiguous and omitted from the lie typology.”

Figure 2. Trust decisions and payoffs as a function of gossip honesty.
(a) Marginal means of trust in Agent as a function of reported trustworthi-
ness; (b) marginal means of payoffs as a function of gossip content and
Agent type, where payoffs = 10 — tokens sent + tokens returned; Agent
trustworthiness is that observed in the previous round and described by
the gossiper; error bars denote 95% Cls.
