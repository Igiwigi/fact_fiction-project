for the height increases from the normal value at a rate (h/—h)/d, very closely for a

unit increase in #, when « is positive. It decreases at the same rate when « is

negative, or to the left, so that both sides of the distorted curve are included. As

stated above, the correction is, in fact, not very important in the subsequent

calculations, its inclusion affecting only the third significant figure in the final

Bu is naturally the more significant.

S Discharge.

© No direct proof of the validity of the usual law obtained for the intensity

Bistribution around the maximum in a line broadened by the ordinary discharge—the

Shlaw of probability I = I, exp (—/d*)—has been given hitherto, although the work of

cer tain well understood limitations in the conditions of excitement. It forms the

Sbasis of the calculations of atomic weights and emission temperatures of sources, made

-g from the results of such experiments as those of: Buisson and Fasryt, and on this

A ground it is desirable that it should be confirmed experimentally in at least one

Fdefinite case, for it is not possible to foretell readily whether the theoretical conditions

are satisfied in any practical case.
