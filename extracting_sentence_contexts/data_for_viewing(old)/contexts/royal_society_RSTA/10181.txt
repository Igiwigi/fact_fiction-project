on the process; otherwise it is difficult to account for the fact that in several of the
experiments with an excess of oxygen a surface proved more than normally active,
and that surface E, before it had been subjected to the treatment with hydrogen at
red heat, could be stimulated by previous exposure to oxygen at 450°. Another
significant circumstance is that, whilst excess of hydrogen always produced a
continuous acceleration throughout a given experiment, any acceleration due to an

excess of oxygen was only manifested during the initial stages. These facts suggest
the following view of the catalytic process. Porous porcelain occludes, or condenses,
both hydrogen and oxygen at rates which depend to some extent upon the physical
condition and past history of the surface. In general, however, whereas in the case
of oxygen the process is extremely rapid and the surface layer is soon saturated, the
occlusion of hydrogen is slower and the limit of saturation much higher. Combination
between the occluded gases occurs at a rate either comparable with, or somewhat
faster than, the rate at which the film of occluded oxygen is renewed, but considerably
faster than the rate of occlusion of hydrogen.
