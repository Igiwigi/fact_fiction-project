STENSIO compares the Macropetalichthid and Elasmobranch neural crania in the
following words: ‘‘(1) The general shape of the primordial neuro-cranium, especially
the tendency to broadening of the ventral surface, partly at the expense of the lateral
surfaces. (This is especially the case in the labyrinth region in which the sacculus and
perhaps the canalis semicircularis externus had about the same relation to the ventral
surface as in Chlamydoselachus and most other Selachians.) (2) The position and
relations of the olfactory capsule. (3) The presence of a nasal fontanelle on the lower
side of the nasal capsule as in Chlamydoselachus and certain other Selachians. (4) The
presence of the cavum precerebrale. (5) The general shape of the labyrinth, especially.
with regard to the position of certain of its main parts, as, for instance, the utriculus.
(6) The presence of the ductus endolymphaticus and the fact that there probably was
a distinct fossa endolymphatica on the dorsal surface of the primordial neuro-cranium
beneath the dermal bones. (7) The fact that the ductus endolymphaticus perforated

the dermal cranial roof and had an external opening situated as in certain primitive
Selachians (Chlamydoselachus). (8) The general shape of the brain as far as this can be
restored from the exit of the nerve canals and the shape of the cavum cerebrale. (9) To
a certain extent the course and arrangement of the blood vessels and the presence of
certain important trunks, as, for instance, the vena hyoidea. (10) The fact that the
palato-quadrates as far as can be judged did not articulate with the ethmoid region but
must have been suspended below this by ligaments. (11) The probable course of the
anterior part of the supraorbital sensory canal. (It should also be mentioned that the
