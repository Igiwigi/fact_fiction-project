The position may be summarised as follows :-—

Any theory of the Leslie pressure must account for four curious facts :—

(1) The distance h at which the cylinder floats above the plate is independent of the
nature of the lubricant and of the solids, provided the surfaces are clean.

(2) The distance is the same in clean air as it is when the air is displaced by a liquid
and remains the same until the pressure of the air is reduced to 2 mm. of mereury. STR WILLIAM HARDY ON PROBLEMS OF THE BOUNDARY STATE. 25

(3) The distance in clean air was decreased by contaminating the solid faces.
(4) The difficulty with which a cylinder can be forced down on to a plate and the
relative ease with which it can be wrung down. Of these the two first are perhaps accounted for by the fact that on either hypothesis
the pressure P is the difference between two quantities, both of which may be functions
of the nature of the lubricant and of the solids. P may then be a pure function of the
geometry of the system over an extremely wide range of conditions. The effect of the contaminant seems to point to the conclusion that the attraction
of the solid is not a shadowless force as Laplace assumed, but a force which, like chemical
affinity, can be saturated.
