The L/W ratios were again determined in the adolescent instar (February 16 for
the controls, February 14 for the others). These are given in the third vertical
column. A slight complication arises here, owing to the fact that in normal animals
the L/W ratio does not remain constant throughout life, but gradually increases,
Hence in order to make comparisons between measurements of the same animal in
different instars, it is necessary to allow for this natural increase. This is most
easily done by reducing the later ratios by a factor which represents the mean
increase for normal specimens for the number of instars which have intervened
between the two measurements. Thus it was found necessary to multiply the
adolescent (third instar) ratios by 0Â°807 to make them comparable with the first
instar measurements.
