Figure 2b illustrates that the trap trajectory oscillates from the initial position and then returns to
the desired position at xp = d. The corresponding time-evolution |Wsra (x, t)|? is shownin figure 2c.
To check the performance of the STA trajectories, we define the fidelity at the final time ty as

F=|(Wsraltp)|®)/?, (3.11)

where wsra(tp) is obtained from the direct numerical simulation (split-operator method) of
equation (2.1) using the STA trajectory of xo(t). The desired ground state @ is obtained by the
imaginary time-evolution technique. ®g ¢ denotes the initial and final ground states, respectively.
Noting that we take the ground state p as an initial state when we do the time-evolution to get
the final state sra (ty). The fidelity of the example in figure 2c at the final time is F > 0.999. The
high performance of fidelity in short time with both attractive and repulsive interactions is plotted
in figure 3. The oscillations are due to the fact that the Gaussian ansatz (2.3) is not the solution of
BECs with atomic interactions. It is reported that fidelity is improved by using a soliton ansatz in
the attractive nonlinear system [17]. Thus in this case, the strong attractive interaction will lead
to the period oscillations (see dotted-green line g = —2) due to the Gaussian ansatz we applied in
variational approach. For the case of repulsive interaction, the period is greater than the attractive
one.

(b) Quartic anharmonicity

In this section, we shall concentrate on the fast transport of BEC in quartic anharmonicity.
The potential reads
