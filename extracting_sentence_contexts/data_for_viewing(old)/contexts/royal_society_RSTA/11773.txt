attribute them to some extent to the thermoid effect described above in Section 6.

Another point which might lead to discrepancies between different observers is one
necessarily incidental to electric calorimetry, and which has been already discussed in
Section 6, ze. the difficulty of exactly defining where the leads to the heating
resistance end and the heating resistance begins. Owing to the large scale of our
apparatus, it was possible to reduce the debatable portion to an amount of not more
than 1/10,000 of the heating resistance. We do not find sufficient data to enable us
to say how this matter was dealt with by former observers.

It is obvious that both the above matters might affect not only the absolute values,
but also the relative values obtained at different parts of the temperature scale.
Whether these causes in fact account for the differences in the values obtained for
the 15° calorie, and in the still larger differences beyond 35° C., it is impossible to say
with certainty.

It is particularly unfortunate that such differences should exist with reference to
so widely accepted a standard as the 15° calorie. But it is clear that, apart from the
points above mentioned, there is a general consensus of observers that the value of J
for 15° C. comes on a very sloping portion of the curve and may therefore be affected
by small temperature differences. It is curious that the result of all observers who
have given a range of absolute values of J (i.e., RowLAND, GrirrirHs, BARNES, and
ourselves) is to give the value of the 30° calorie as 4°174 within +0°001. This may
be seen by reference to fig. 11, and may be connected with the fact that at 30° C.
