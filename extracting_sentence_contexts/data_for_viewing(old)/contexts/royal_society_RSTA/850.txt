from a human perspective, forever. This despite the fact that the amount of atmospheric


CO» that launched the melting was ‘corrected’ later by negative emissions. Can we count on
nothing like this hypothetical scenario happening? That is the gamble taken by less ambitious
mitigation.

In the current context, what is particularly striking about this scenario is the following. Prior
to any awareness of the apparent possibility of ‘recovery’ from emissions ‘overshoot’ through
negative emissions, certain generations might have decided to be less ambitious about mitigation
simply out of preoccupation with themselves and a simple desire to avoid expense and disruption
and to continue to enjoy convenience. We saw in the first section that this would have amounted
in fact to those generations taking a gamble in which they themselves can only gain and future
generations can only lose. But those generations certainly might not have conceived of their
actions in this way or been conscious that they were imposing such a bad gamble on future

generations. a
