Hp/sin (¢ — J) = H/sin (x/2 + v).

whence we get
H sin (¢ — ¥)/I sin ¥ cos b= N,

But this experimental evidence refers only to high fields—+.e., saturation states.
(ii) In his thesis Dz Waarp also remarks: “. . . . volgens WrIss is

Hsin (¢ — ¥)/L sin ¥ cos &

tennaasteloijy konstant. De afwijkingen blijken groter naarmate men met zwakkere
velden te doen heeft” (p. 35). Thus, according to Dm Waarp the result does not
represent facts when weak fields are employed.

(ili) Thirdly, Kunz also observes that “in large fields the agreement is good ; in
weak fields deviations from the straight lines occur which are not yet explained ”
(p. 171).

Neither De Waarp, nor Kunz, give the exact nature of the deviations. We can
conclude that the deviations are due possibly to temperature-eflects, or if not to tem-
perature-effects, we must at least reject this sort of grouping of the magnetic elements.
In the next article we consider the second sort.
