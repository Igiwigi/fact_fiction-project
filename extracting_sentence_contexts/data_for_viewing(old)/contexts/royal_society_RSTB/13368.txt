respiration slows and electrons accumulate along the ETC
instead of being passed to oxygen, which combines with two
protons to form water [15]. The expected interrelations between
ATP and ROS production are not completely understood [16],
but dissipation of the proton motive force, as a result of high
ATP synthesis, would result in an inverse relationship between
ATP and ROS production because electrons can move freely
through the ETC to be accepted by oxygen, producing ATP.
On the other hand, a positive relationship between ROS and
ATP might also be expected; uncoupling proteins and passive
proton leak can change the electrochemical potential, resulting
in inefficient ATP production. The relationship between ATP
and ROS is further complicated by the fact that they also
depend on sperm energy balance and activity and substrate
availability (e.g. ADP [15,16]). Balancing these factors is
expected to play a pivotal role during SC because ‘speed’
may come at a cost to longevity [17]. Genetic and environ-
mental variation should mediate these trade-offs given
that the efficiency of OXPHOS in mitochondria, and there-
fore ROS and ATP production, is known to depend on both
cytonuclear genetic variation and the specific environment
that mitochondria experience [13,18-20].

Non-neutral mitochondrial (mt) DNA variants that affect
mitochondrial function are likely to have strong effects on
