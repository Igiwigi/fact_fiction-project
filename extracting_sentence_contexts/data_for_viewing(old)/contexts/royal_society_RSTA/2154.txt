be exponentially suppressed, in the same way that soliton-antisoliton production is suppressed : ~
[26]. However, the production rate may be enhanced if a strong magnetic field is present, in a : 3
region comparable to the sphaleron size. And the production rate is almost certainly enhanced at :S
high temperatures [27,28]. oâ„¢

Whether production of a sphaleron in particle collisions is at all likely may become clearer
when experiments at LHC, or at somewhat higher energy, find evidence for simultaneous
production of two or more Higgs particles together with a few W or Z bosons. The signal for
this would be the production of several high-energy leptons (electrons, muons or neutrinos).

Remarkably, sphaleron production and decay is associated with a net change in baryon
number B and lepton number L [29,30]. This is the result of an anomaly in baryon and lepton
number conservation laws, and related to the fact that a sphaleron has Chern-Simons number }
Sphaleron production is therefore potentially extremely important, as it may help us understand
the baryon asymmetry of the universe. The universe is dominated by matter (protons) rather
than antimatter (antiprotons) but the source of the asymmetry remains unknown (although there
are many ideas). Certainly, any observation of baryon or lepton number violation would be
revolutionary, as no experiment so far has ever detected such a violation. However, measuring
a net change in baryon number in a high-energy collision may be hard, as many mesons and
baryons, and also antibaryons, are produced. It may be easier to keep track of charged leptons,
but the neutrinos carry lepton number too, and are generally undetected.

The Skyrme model is a field theory of mesons, an effective theory of the strong interactions at
