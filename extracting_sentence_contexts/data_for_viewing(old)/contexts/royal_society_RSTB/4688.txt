throughout, while there is little. if any, complexity in the ambulacral plating.


AMBULACRUM IN THE ECHINOIDEA HOLECTYPOIDA. 447

There is thus no indication of any special adaptation for respiratory purposes (podia
cannot avoid performing that function to some degree), and the small size of the
pores would suggest that the slender podia that passed through them could not
have possessed any great power of adhesion. Perhaps the crowded ornament
of Macropygus and Anorthopygus (indicative of abundant and fairly massive radioles)
may be associated with ambulacral failure in this respect.

As far as can be ascertained from the facts of geological distribution, the
Pygasteridze appear to have been exclusively inhabitants of shallow water, and
probably to have been restricted to the littoral zone. Their remains are found in
the limestones and sandstones only in the Lower Oolites, and although Pygaster
macrocyphus occurs in the Kimmeridgian, it is not found in the Kimmeridge Clay.
On the whole, the clays of the Oolitic period represent the deposits of more open
water than the sands or oolitic and coralline limestones, many of which are of almost
inter-tidal origin. The distribution of the Cretaceous members of the family gives
similar evidence. Both Macropygus and Anorthopygus are to be collected only
in the “Greensand” facies of the Cretaceous deposits. The latter genus is, so
far as present experience goes, restricted in Britain to the Haldon Hill drift and
the Hibernian Greensand, never haying been found in the chalk proper. It is thus
reasonable to claim for the Pygasteridee as a whole a general habitat not very
