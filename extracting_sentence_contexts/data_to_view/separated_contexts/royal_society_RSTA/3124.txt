Even here the contradiction may be more apparent than
real, as the influence of sunshine may depend on the hour of the day. An intensifica-
tion for instance of the afternoon minimum may be accompanied by a compensating
increase of potential during the night. Considerations of this kind must in fact be
borne in mind in other cases besides that of sunshine. § 25. In 1896 I paid special attention to aqueous vapour, as ExNer’s theory, which
associated potential gradient and aqueous vapour in a definite formula, was then
rather in the ascendant.
