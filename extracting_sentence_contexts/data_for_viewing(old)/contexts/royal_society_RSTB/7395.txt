Selaginella selaginoides (L.) Link

A microspore of this most characteristic late-Glacial plant was found in the pollen slides
of the Hawks Tor 36 series at the top of zone IT.

Jessen records the species from Ireland in zones II and III as well as later.

Sparganium

Pollen of Sparganium occurs throughout the lower muds (zone II) at the two Hawks Tor
sites, sometimes in considerable abundance, a fact which accords with the identification
of Sparganium fruits. Iversen (1946) records Sparganium pollen from the Danish late-Glacial,
and Jessen (1949) gives Irish records for fruits of S. minimum and_S. simplex in zone II and
S. ramosum in zone III.

Thalictrum
Pollen of this genus was identified fairly frequently in zones II and III of the series at
Hawks Tor in the lowest of the Parsons Park samples, and in all samples of the lower muds
