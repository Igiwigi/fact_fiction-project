The former
may imply relationship, the latter must be regarded as “stage features’? (CHALK 1935),
representing stages of development passed through by members of totally unrelated
groups. The great difficulty in this part of the work has been that the anatomist must
use the genera, as established by the taxonomists, to find out what are reliable generic
characters, while, as will be shown in § XII, the taxonomists are not unanimous as to
the constitution of the different genera. In handling the material assembled for this investigation two alternative methods of
presenting the facts were considered. The first, that of treating each genus separately
and then reviewing the anatomical characteristics of the family as a whole, was dis-
carded; it would involve much repetition, because the genera are very much alike in
several of the features examined. The second method, which is the one adopted, is to
consider each anatomical feature separately, establishing so far as possible the position
of each genus in regard to that feature, and finally to give an abbreviated description
of the genera, picking out the particular features by which each can be distinguished
from the rest.
