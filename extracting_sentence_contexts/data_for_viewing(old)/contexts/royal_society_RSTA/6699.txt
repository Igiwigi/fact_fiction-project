It should, perhaps, be pointed out that the method by which we have proved theorems 13
and 14 offers no hope of giving an explicit value for the ‘absolute’ constant 3,. The difficulty
lies with lemma 9. It may be conjectured that theorem 13 would remain valid as long as

since — 31 is the next discriminant of a complex cubic field after — 23. At present, no method
is known which offers hope of proving this; but possibly the fact that theorem 13 indicates
the existence of a second minimum for this problem may lead to further work on the question.

The conjecture just referred to has a bearing on the important unsolved problem of
simultaneous Diophantine approximation to two irrational numbers @, ®. If ¢ denotes
the lower bound of the numbers c’ such that the inequalities
