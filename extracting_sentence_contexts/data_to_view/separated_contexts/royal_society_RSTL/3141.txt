ELECTRICAL ATTRACTION DEPENDENT ON PARALLEL FORCES. 241

ticle of the opposite electricity = b on the opposed body B, instead of snpposing the
force to be confined to the near particle immediately opposed to it, we cannot take
all the forces as equal, and the whole force to be as a b; it must still be only as some
function of it, and we have to sum the forces under this condition. But in this case
even, all the oblique actions may at last be indefinitely small in respect of the force
exerted upon the opposite and nearest particle, which would still admit of the whole
action being reduced to a system of parallel forces, such as represented in fig. 18,
more especially when we take into consideration the fact that the force between two
particles, a, b, fig. 23, is greatly diminished, and may become very small by placing a
similar third particle, d, nearer either of them, supposing it charged with the opposite
electricity; and this result will be again augmented by placing another particle, e,
nearer the other in a similar way. In this case the action between the original par-
ticles a, b almost vanishes.

45, In concluding this communication it may not be improper to state, that the
experiments were conducted in a good insulating atmosphere, generally in a room
dried by an air stove : the late contrivance of Dr. Arxorr is quite invaluable to the
practical electrician for this purpose.
