Thus, alternative methods of extraction
are occasionally implemented; for example, ultrasound-assisted extraction with methanol (after
micropulverization of the specimen) [50,51]. To remove matrix interferences (especially after
digestion), subsequent clean-up by solid-phase extraction (SPE) is necessary [48]. In fact, such
extensive preparation of hair and nail specimens is laborious, time-consuming and may introduce =
errors to the final result [52]. Less extensive specimen preparation is required for imaging MSâ€”in : 3
which case, longitudinally sectioned hair specimens are often used [28]. Hair and nail specimens
are very stable.
