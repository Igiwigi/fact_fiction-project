It will be seen that there is a
strong resemblance between the two photographs, in particular with regard to the
repetition of pattern parallel to the fibre axis. For silk the period in this direction is
about 7 A.,* while for B-keratin it is rather less, something between 6-7 and 6-8 A.t
(for the detailed description of the two keratin photographs, see I). It is not at all
probable—for keratin at least (see above)—that lengths such as these represent the true
period along a polypeptide chain-system, but are rather an expression of the fact that
in the simplest formulation of the fully-extended general chain :—

the side-chains project alternately on opposite sides of the main-chain. (This poimt
will be clearer from the models discussed below.)
