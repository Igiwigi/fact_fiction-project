It is true that analogy may induce us to conclude, that since
stars appear to be suns, and suns, according to the common
opinion, are bodies that serve to enlighten, warm, and sustain
a 'system of planets, we may have an idea of numberless globes
that serve for the habitation of living-creatures. - But if these
suns, themselves are primary planets, we may see some-thou-
sands, of: them with. our own. eyes ;. and millions by the help
of, telescopes ; 'when at the:same time, the same analogicat

reasoning till remains in full force, with regard to the planets
which these suns may support.' | -

In this place I may, however, take notice 'that, from other
considerations, the idea of suns or stars being merely:the 8up-
porters of systems of planets, is not. absolutely to be admitted
as a general one. Among the great-number of very compressed
clusters of stars, I have given in my» catalogues,-there are some
which open a different, view-of the heavens to us. The stars
in them /are-.80 very! close- together,” that; |notwithstanding
the great distance at which! we may-suppose :the cluster itself
to be, it will-hardly be possible to assign any 8ufficient mutual
distance to the» stars composing|the.cluster,-to leave room for
crowding in those planets, for-whose support these-stars-haye
been;-or might (be, supposed to! exist. ; It Should scemy there-
fore, highly probable; that they; exist for themselves ;\.and are,
in fact, only very capital, lucid, primary planets, connected to-
gether-in one great systein-of mutual gupport:://

As ih this argument I do not proceed upon conjectures, but
have actual observations in view, I shall wention an instance in

"the clusters, No. 26, 28, and 35» VI: class, of my catalogue of

nebulz, and clusters of stars.” (See Phil; Trans. Vol. LXXIX.
