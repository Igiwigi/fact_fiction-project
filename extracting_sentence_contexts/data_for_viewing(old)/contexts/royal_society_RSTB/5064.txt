The attachments of the other groups of cupules are not shown, but the orientation of
the several cupules is in most instances such that the cupule segments point towards
the centre of a sphere on the surface of which the cupules lie. This centre of arrangement
coincides very nearly with the small structure in the angle of the fork. There is, therefore,
on the one hand, a clear suggestion of some relation between the ring of cupules and the
forking of the rachis of the frond, and, on the other hand, it appears less likely that the
cupules were related to the pinne attached to the sides of the main rachis or to the arms
of the frond,

The similarity between the frond of Telangium bifidum and Sphenopteris Teiliana is
most striking; one has merely to glance at figs. 17 and 24, Plate 17, to see that the
arrangement of the pinne in relation to the forking rachis of the frond is identical. The
definite fact of attachment of a Telangium-like rachis in the fork of the frond of
Sphenopteris Teiliana, and the presence of fructifications in significant relation to the
fork of the rachis in Telangium bifidum, give grounds for believing that in the former

the naked rachis was the fructification-bearing part of the frond, and that in the latter
the fructification was connected to the frond in the angle of the fork.

That the equal forking in at least one other Lower Carboniferous frond type was not
