In some —
stems this medullary meristem gave rise merely to secondary parenchyma, with some- L
what thickened walls; in other cases, however, it acted as a regular cambium, :
producing medullary wood and bast with inverted orientation. In the latter case, we
have precisely the same anomaly as in Tecoma, odes, or Acantholimon among recent
plants. It is a most remarkable fact, that this peculiarity should have already
appeared as an occasional variation ina carboniferous plant, so absolutely remote from
the Dicotyledons as is Lyginodendron. A more striking warning against the indis-
criminate use of, even conspicuous anatomical characters cannot be imagined. Such —
a warning, it is true, is not needed by those who have experience in anatomy.
