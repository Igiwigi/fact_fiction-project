The microbes that can
process these oligosaccharides contribute to infant health by

elping to preventing invasion of the intestinal lining by
pathogenic microbes [69]. Most of our antibiotics have been
derived from microbial products that evolved to kill other
microbes [66]. Together, these facts suggest that multicellular
organisms may be using the innovations of benign microbes
to protect us from pathogenic microbes. Future innovations in human medicine may be based on
harnessing microbial innovation. Stable microbial communities

have evolved mechanisms to exclude invaders [70].
