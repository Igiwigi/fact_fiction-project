and b € B, the element (I”[A, B])qy is 1 if (a,b) is an edge in G and 0 otherwise.

Definition 2.7 (cut-rank). Let us assume that A is a subset of the vertices V of some graph G
with adjacency matrix I”. The cut-rank cutrk,(G) of G with respect to A, is then defined as

cutrk,(G) = rankg, ('[A, V\A]), (2.27)

where rankg, is the rank over the finite field of order two. oO
Note that the cut-rank is symmetric in the sense that

cutrk,(G) = rankp, (’[A, V\A]) =rankg, ([V\A, A]')= cutrky\,4(G). (2.28)

Interestingly, the cut-rank with respect to A of a graph G is in fact equal to the Schmidt-rank of

the state |G) with respect to the bipartition (A, V\A).4
Next we define what is called a rank-decomposition of a graph.

Definition 2.8 (rank-decomposition). A rank-decomposition of a graph G is a pair R =(T, 4),
where T is a subcubic tree and yp is a bijection w: V(G) > {1:1 is a leaf of T}. A subcubic tree is
a tree with at least two vertices and each vertex has degree less or equal to 3. Any edge e in T
splits the tree into two connected components upon deletion and therefore induces a partition
(Ae, Be) of the leaves. The width of an edge e of the subcubic tree is defined as the cut-rank of
the corresponding partition. Furthermore, the width of the rank-decomposition is defined as the
maximum width over all edges, i.e.
