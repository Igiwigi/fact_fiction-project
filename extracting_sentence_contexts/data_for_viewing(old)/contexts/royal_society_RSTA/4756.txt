2. Optics 1p

Before addressing successful experiments, let us start by discussing fundamental aspects/ 2S
limitations specific for electromagnetism, especially for (visible) optics. First, when discussing 78
figure 1, we have seen that the azimuthal component of the velocity vector near the inner Dy
circle needs to be larger than in the surrounding to obtain an omnidirectional ‘free-space’ cloak. [5
This aspect is obvious even without knowing anything about coordinate transformations: the 1
wave must somehow make a detour around the object to be hidden, yet we request the same .
propagation time as without the object, so the velocity must be larger. For electromagnetic
waves in vacuum or air as surrounding, this simple fact imposes serious restrictions: the local
phase velocity of light can exceed the vacuum speed of light at a given frequency (refractive
index n(w) < 1). However, if we aim for broadband operation, e.g. for the entire visible spectral
range, dispersion must be negligible and the group and the energy velocity would be equal to
the phase velocity. According to the theory of relativity, mass and energy are equivalent and
cannot propagate faster than the vacuum speed of light. Thus, free-space macroscopic (many
wavelengths in size) omnidirectional broadband cloaking for light waves is not compatible with
the laws of physics, i.e. it is ‘impossible’. Unfortunately, such an ideal cloak is what is expected
when reading about invisibility cloaking in the media.

Even for monochromatic operation, causality (the fact that we cannot change the past) imposes
serious constraints for passive materials. To bring the phase velocity above the vacuum speed of
light (< Re(1) < 1), one needs resonances. Even far away from the resonance, the real part of the
