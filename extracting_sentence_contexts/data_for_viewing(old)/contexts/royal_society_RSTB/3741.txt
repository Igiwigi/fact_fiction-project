B. The Theory of the Serial Homology of the Pineal Organs with the Lateral Eyes.

If we once admit that the pineal sense-organs are to be regarded as dislocated members
of a pair, there seems no valid reason why we should not push our conclusions a little
further and follow Locy (1894, a, 6) in regarding them as serially homologous with
the lateral eyes. Locy’s conclusions were, as is well known, originally based upon
his observation of the occurrence, on the yet unclosed neural plate of Acanthias,
of two pairs of symmetrically developed “ accessory optic vesicles” behind those which
give rise to the lateral eyes, the pineal organ being derived from the middle pair
of the three. These results undoubtedly require confirmation, but I think some of
the facts which I have brought forward in the present memoir tend to strengthen his
position. I have pointed out, in discussing the question of the neuromery of the fore-
and mid-brain that we can recognise ‘no fewer than six pairs of hollow out-
growths from these parts of the brain in Sphenodon, viz., the cerebral hemispheres,
the optic vesicles of the lateral eyes, the recessus thalami prenucleares, the pineal
outgrowths, the recessus geniculorum, and the optic lobes, and that each pair may
perhaps be taken to indicate an originally distinct neuromere, while all six may be
serially homologous.

Von Kuprrer (1906, p. 161) objects to the view that the pineal outgrowths
(and also the more posterior of Locy’s accessory optic vesicles) are serially homo-
logous with the optic vesicles of the lateral eyes, on the ground that the former
arise dorsally and the latter ventrally, but I cannot see that there is much force in
