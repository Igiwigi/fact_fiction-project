In the first place
one notices that in the downward continuation of each of the phloem groups a strand of
xylem (2, «*) appears along the middle of it so as to leave, in either case, a few sieve-tubes
both to the right and to the left of the xylem. In the second place, the downward
continuation of the pith is occupied by a number of cells exactly similar to those just
described as sieve-tubes. These are, in fact, the sieve-tubes of the internal phloem (iph)
seen in tangential view: the section in its oblique course has transgressed from the
periphery of the pith to the phloem which immediately surrounds it and abuts on the
inner faces of the xylem strands. Passing towards the bottom of the figure, we see
even a third xylem strand (2°) traversed tangentially by the same oblique plane ; and
between the three xylem groups are wedged in two narrow phloem rays (rph indicated
by arrows), which are clearly in continuity above with the internal phloem. *

The figures reproduced in Plates 5 and 6 are also from untouched photomicrographs.
