The expression for the refraction image SNR in equation (3.6) is very similar to the SNR for a
single El image given by equation (3.4). In particular, if we consider in the latter case a detector
edge positioned at the centre of the beam, so that C} =0.5, the only difference between the two
formulae is a factor V2, ie. SNRangle peak =v2. SNR¢I peak: This is explained by the fact that
two images, instead of one, are used in the calculation of the refraction angle map, thus doubling
the photon statistics and accordingly reducing the noise.

We now turn our attention to the analysis of the edge positions optimizing the SNR of a
single EI image (see equation (3.4)). We consider, to this end, the set-up available at the ID17
beamline of the ESRF [18,19]. The vertical size of the virtual source is about 244m and the
distance between the source and the pre-sample slit is 145 m; besides, we consider the following
acquisition parameters (which partially match the experimental conditions used in [18,19]): pre-
sample aperture = 20 1m, sample placed just downstream of the pre-sample slit, 294 = 10m and
X-ray energy = 85 keV.
