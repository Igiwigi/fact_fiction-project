how it varies according to live oyster density, based on exper-
imental and natural oyster assemblages from North Carolina.
Assessment of the relationship between carbon flux (CE Mg

Based on the single site available for sampling, Pleisto-
cene oysters in the Chesapeake region reached significantly
higher population densities than their modern counterparts
(figure 2; 15,302 = 11.13, p < 0.0001), growing under the same
temperature and salinity conditions. Although it is imposs-
ible to quantify nutrient levels at the Pleistocene sites,
density (number of oysters m™*) is almost an order of magni-
tude higher in these fossil reefs, despite the fact that nutrient
Inorganic carbon (IC, Mg C ha yr™) and organic carbon (OC, Mg levels are almost certainly higher in the modern bay. This
