OF FORMATION OF FOOD VACUOLES IN INFUSORIA. 377

ss of motility, indeed, the act of ingestion has been described in some detail ; but
e is, I think, no published account of the process of aggregation. I would urge,
ever, that there is formation of a viscous substance, which unites scattered ingesta
ng their stay within Ameba, and that its presence, hidden by the fact that the
here is often massive, is indicated by the following experimental results : (#) In
hing the process of digestion in Ameba, I have often seen the enclosure of such
ve infusoria as monads. And in the notes on these observations (made some years
) I find frequent mention of the fact that a monad continued to move in the
quole of ingestion for 5, 7, or 10 minutes, and thus was suddenly and finally
siaced to quiescence ; the statement seems to afford. a parallel to the sequence of
igression, quiescence, and aggregation in Carchesium (2). (b) Again I was struck,
at that time, by the cohesion of ingesta during solution. I may perhaps
strate this by reference to an experiment in which a monad and a green

oO
ococcus were received into one vacuole of ingestion. The complex mass was
