5d°6s*F and *F increase rapidly with the atomic number, although the spread of the
configuration shows only a small and irregular change. The parallelism of many of the
connecting lines in fig. 3 is striking, and it has been used as evidence in identifying
levels. Obvious exceptions are the two levels corresponding to ‘*P., and *D,,. They have
been pushed far down and up by the presence of 2F,, between them, which in turn is
due to the rapid increase of the term separations with atomic number. The selection
of 20093-0 as 65°F, and 24475-7 as 6s°G,, is based partly on the comparison with
Nimand Pd rand partly on the fact that that choice is more consistent with the observed
intensities.

The relative positions of the structures nd? and nd°(n-+1)s are very different in the
three long periods. It might be expected that their difference would decrease as the
value of n increases. This is not the case, the difference being in fact about 8000 in Nin,
25,000 in Pdi and 5000 in Pt. The 4d and 5s electrons in the second long period
thus show much greater differences in binding energy than do the 3d and 4s of the first
period or the 5d and 6s of the third period. No theoretical explanation of this fact has
been given.

In Ptu the structure d’s? appears. Its position in Nim can be estimated from Zn
and Cu to be about 35,000—40,000 wave numbers above d®s. In Pdu it should be
about 6000 wave numbers higher still.
