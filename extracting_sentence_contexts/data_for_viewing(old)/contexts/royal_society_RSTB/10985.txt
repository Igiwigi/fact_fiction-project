for excess absorbed light energy vanished under this
photon flux density.

(b) Light shift changes the pattern of gene expression
Metabolic reactions and gene regulation are two primary pro-
cesses of cells leading carbon allocation to different pathways.
In response to environmental changes, cells adjust the regulat-
ory programmes and shift the metabolic states as reflected in
their physiology [55]. To study the crosstalk between light
acclimation and gene regulation, we exposed the cells under
sudden light stress after acclimation to ML. A schematic of
the central carbon metabolism is presented in the electronic
supplementary material, Data SD6. Despite the fact that
mRNA abundance is not always correlated with protein
levels and enzyme activities [55], it is frequently used as a
good indicator of metabolic modifications [56]. Based on the
measurements, the expression pattern of genes/isogenes
encoding different enzymes in carbon metabolism pathways
was variable according to light intensity and acclimation
period after light shift (expression pattern of the genes is
shown in figure 2 and logÂ» values of the expression ratios are
displayed in electronic supplementary material, Data SD7).
