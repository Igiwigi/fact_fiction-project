of silver, whether it be found isolated, as is the case on the photogenic paper, or it
be found in the presence of metallic silver, as happens upon the Daguerreotype plate ;
but they produce quite an opposite effect upon the silyer plate, whatever may be the
colour previously given to the surface by these two radiations, endowing it with a
property, the one of attracting, the other of repelling the mercurial vapours. We
must take care not to confound these two results ; we can conceive two different
actions giving the same colour to the iodide of silver, and we can also conceive that
these two actions may be endowed with contrary properties as regards the fixation
of mercurial vapour.

The facts pointed out by M. Gavpin are the results of an action which does not
belong to the Daguerreotype, since they are manifested without the aid of mercury ;
for we mnst not lose sight of the fact, that the production of the Daguerreotype
image is due only to the affinity for mercury of the parts previously affected by the
photogenic rays. It does not then follow from the production of an image without
mercury, by crystallization or some peculiar arrangement of the molecules, that the
red, orange, and yellow rays exert a continuing action analogous to that which deter-
mines the fixation of mercurial vapour.

The experiments of Sir J. Herscner, of Dr. Drayer, of M. LEreBours, and of
Messrs. Fovcaurr and F1zeav, to prove the protective and destructive action of
the red rays, were made with the prism.

These philosophers have thus operated with the isolated rays in all their natural
purity, and after them it would have been useless to seek to confirm or to contradict
