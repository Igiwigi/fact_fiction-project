998), concerning the binary pulsar PSR 1913+16. But the real reason for expecting
hat quantum theory, no less than general relativity, must bend its very rules is that
hese rules lead one essentially into paradox, when they are employed too far from
he situations to which quantum theory has been successfully applied. The problem I refer to is what is called the measurement problem, which has to
do with the fact that the procedure that one adopts in order to treat ‘quantum sys-
ems’ does not appear to apply to large objects. This procedure is the evolution of a
quantum state according to Schrédinger’s equation (or equivalent), whereby super-
ositions of different alternative happenings must be treated as co-existing simulta-
neously, and this equation states that such superpositions should persist indefinitely. However, in a quantum measurement, one alternative or another must be the result
(quantum state reduction), and this cannot be achieved simply by the Schrédinger-
evolution of the state alone.
