T have recently verified the existence of the identical equation just
referred to, and have obtained the expression for the factor M; and with the assistance
of this identical equation I have obtained the expression for the cubinvariant of the form

(1, 0, C, D, ELy, 1).

98 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON TSCHIRNHAUSEN'S TRANSFORMATION. The expression for the quadrinvariant was, as already mentioned, given in the former
memoir: I find that the two invariants are in fact the invariants of a certain linear
function of U, H; viz. the linear function is =VU'U+ZO'H; so that, denoting by I*,
J*, the quadrinvariant and the cubinyariant respectively of the form

I*=T(U'U +4@'H),
1*=J(U'U+40'H),

we have

where T, J signity the functional operations of forming the two invariants respectively. The function (1, 0, C, D, E'Ly, 1)', obtained by the application of TscnmNnavsrx's
transformation to the equation

(a, 6, e, d, 6X, 1)'=0,
has thus the same invariants with the function
U'U+40'H=U'(a, 6, c, d, eXz, 1)*+4&(ac—t?, ad—be, ae+2bd— 3, be—erd, ce da,

and it is consequently a linear transformation of the last-mentioned function ; 80 that
the application of 'TscnIRNHAusEN's transformation to the equation U=0 gives an
equation linearly transformable into, and thus virtually equivalent to, the equation
U'U+49'H=0,
!
which is an equation involving the single parameter =; this appears to me a result of
considerable interest.
