This being the N
component of F, the force itself is given by (122), as is necessary. It is V curl h,. B that expresses the translational force on intrinsically magnetised
matter, and this harmonises with the fact that the flux B due to any impressed
force hy depends solely upon curl hy. Also, it is —VT, that explains the forcive on elastically magnetised matter, e.g.,
Farapay’s motion of matter to or away from the places of greatest intensity of the
field, independent of its direction. 454 MR. 0.
