throughout the whole vertical extent of the Downtonian strata. With minor
differences their mode of occurrence is the same in every exposure ; there are
surfaces closely covered with mingled, more or less decayed plant-debris and isolated
specimens or fragments distributed through the rock. In practically every exposure
Pachytheca, Prototaxites (Nematophyton), Nematothallus, Cooksonia and numerous isolated
spores were found. Parka is certainly not common, but more information as to its
occurrence is required ; it would seem to have been mostly met with in upper beds
of the series. Zosterophyllum is as yet only known from one relatively high horizon (1.8)
at Caldy Island. The peculiar organism, here provisionally described under the
name WNematothallus (?) radiata, but suggesting comparison with Spongarium, is only
known from one exposure in the Temeside Shales. Actinophyllum has only been
found in the Downton Sandstone of Perton quarry. Interesting as these fossils of
occasional occurrence are, the striking fact is the uniformity of the general assemblage
(Pachytheca, Cooksonia, Prototaxites, Nematothallus, walled spores) which always
accompanies them.

This assemblage of plants occurs in numerous localities at the horizon of the
Bone-bed and the Downton Sandstone immediately above it. The plant-remains
have been collected and studied from the Saltwells inlier ; from Ludford Lane and
Downton Castle Bridge ; from Hagley Park; and from Perton, Tarrington, and
other exposures in the Woolhope inlier. The special abundance of Pachytheca
immediately above the bone-bed is striking. The same plants were found in the
Temeside Shales at Tin Mill Race as fairly abundant, but more isolated specimens,
and at Rhuddwr Quarry, where the abundance of slender branch-systems (cf,
Cooksonia pertoni) is interesting. The localities mentioned above, and the list could
