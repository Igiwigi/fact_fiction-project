The error arose in this way. The
stars were inserted in common, not Indian ink, and, the drawings during their transmis-
8ion by post becoming slightly damp, the ink made its way into the paper, the dots in
8ome cases becoming small blots. In a few instances it was necessary to set this right
to prevent misconception, and some alteration was in consequence made in the Plates;
but as to the remainder, we thought it sufficient to state the fact generally, that many
of the principal stars were somewhat too large. This remark applies especially to
figures 1 and 3, Plate XXV., and to figures 24, 28, 29, 30, 34, Plate XXVIIL. Phil.
