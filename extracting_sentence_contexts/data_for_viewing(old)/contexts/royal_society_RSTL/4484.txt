production of heat and light during the processes of decay. During animal life there
is a continual restoration to the inorganic world of carbonic acid, water, and ammo-
nia; and the amount thus given up by the animal organism bears an exact propor-
tion, on the one hand, to the amount of heat and motion which are generated by it,
and on the other to the amount of organic compounds consumed as food. So that,
on the whole there is strong reason to believe that the entire amount of force of all
kinds (as of materials) received by an animal during a given period, is given back by it
during that period, his condition at the end of the term being the same as at the be-
ginning. And all that has been expended in the building up of the organism, is given
back by its decay after death.

relations between those already known. He has preferred, in fact, rather to build
upon the foundation afforded by the generally admitted facts of Physiological
science*, than to go in search of phenomena, his account of which might be questioned
by those indisposed to admit his leading ideas. If those ideas be correct, they will
be found, he believes, to afford a precision to Physiological doctrines which they have
never before possessed ; and to open out, a vast number of new lines of inquiry, which
promise an ample harvest of results, not only valuable in a scientific view, but likely
to be fertile in applications to various departments of the therapentic art. At any
