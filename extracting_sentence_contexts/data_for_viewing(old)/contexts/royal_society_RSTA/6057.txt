The system’s total energy is the value of E= J d°xH for solutions to the field equations, as
discussed above in §2(c). From the Coulomb-gauge analysis there, one has h = constant, so from
(2.38), one also has zg = 0. Moreover, the field aj has no conjugate momentum and its variation
yields the constraint 0;77; = 0 just as in standard d = 4 Maxwell theory. Consequently, for solutions
to the effective-theory field equations arising from the action (2.18), one has the conserved total
energy

B= | ax (Sam + vii), Ql)


which is simply equal to the standard, positive semidefinite, energy of Maxwell theory alone.
Although allowed by the field equations, the g field does not contribute to the total energy. Clearly,
the fact that g may be removed by the residual harmonic symmetry is the reason for its non-
appearance in the total energy (2.41). At least in the source-free theory we have considered so far,
the g field may be considered redundant.

3. Covert symmetry breaking

(a) Scalar electrodynamics

In §2, we have seen that the unambiguous leading-order dynamics of the D =5 system (2.4) is just
d=4 Maxwell theory. The non-standard Dirichlet/Robin boundary conditions on the interval I
do give rise to the h and g fields in the leading-order effective action (2.18), but the analysis of §2
shows that has no dynamics while g may be considered redundant, giving no contribution to
the total energy. Following [15], we now extend the model by U(1) gauge-covariantly coupling
