The transformed equa-
tion is
N(A—AV,+U7)+Qzw=0,

where the term Q may be calculated without difficulty : the first term of this is

={y*+4(2+90)z}*  4/w+f,g—fi(dz+1)] .. [a+fg—fi(tz+90))],
the developed expressions of (A*%%— AV, +U}) and of 7 into the product of the linear
factors being in fact each
