The plates were measured by examining them pressed together with a glass-rule
under a microscope, and reading on the scale the positions of the lines, perpendicular
to the jet, touching the drop-like free ends of the jet-pieces. ‘Thereupon the mean of
the results found for the two ends of each cut was calculated, and the difference
between the means from two succeeding cuts, divided by the magnification of the plate,
was equated to the distance which the jet had moved while the rotation-apparatus
had made a revolution. The conditions of the correctness of this were partly that
the cuts moved independently of each other, partly that the ends of the jet contracted
themselves equally into the respective jet-pieces during the time which a cut took to
move from the one place where it was photographed to the other. That these
conditions were satisfied appears, first, from the fact that the part of the jet-pieces
placed midway between the cuts was completely undisturbed by the cutting of the
jet (see the photographs), and, secondly, from the symmetrical forms of the ends of
the jet facing each other. The magnification of the plate was found by taking a photograph of a glass-rule
placed directly under the jet. The interval of time between the cuts was determined as a mean from the number
of revolutions per second during the time of exposure; the photographic plate also
giving a sort of mean of the single exposures, very great accuracy might be obtained
in this way.
