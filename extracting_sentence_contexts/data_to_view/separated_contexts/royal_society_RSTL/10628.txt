The following experiment furnishes an additional proof. Just as the impact of a vibrating air-jet, playing in air against an orifice, may excite
ound, 80 the impact of a water jet playing against electrodes immersed in water, may
excite electrical undulations. In fact if both jet tube and electrodes of a polarizing
transmitter be immersed in_a vessel containing the same fluid with which the jet is
supplied, the transmitter will not cease to operate, provided that the electrodes are
brought much eloser to the orifice : for the continuous portion of the jet now becomes
much shortened, owing to friction against the surrounding fluid. The diagram
(fig. 10) represents the most striking form of the experiment. The jet plays against the exposed end of a fine platinum wire, P, firmly embedded
in the centre of a small ebonite rod, R, which passes through the bottom of the trough
T. A side tube, L, carries off the overflow from the trough.
