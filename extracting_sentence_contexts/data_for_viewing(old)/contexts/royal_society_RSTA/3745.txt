and V2 + €2 equals the -CH3 dissociation energy of structure D (see figure 2) at large r. A relaxed
scan along the C-C reaction coordinate for the final parametrized diamond EVB model is shown
in figure 4b. The fact that the neopentane fits in figure 4a can produce reasonable dissociation
curves at the diamond surface (figure 4b) indicates that the fitted EVB parameters have some
degree of transferability.

4. Molecular dynamics simulations of —CH3 dissociation at the diamond surface

(a) NVE simulations

Having obtained an accurate and efficient -CH3 dissociation potential at the diamond surface,
we investigated the relative rates of processes (R2a) and (R2b) using non-equilibrium NVE MD
simulations. Here, ‘non-equilibrium’ refers to the fact that the initial conditions of each NVE
trajectory were modified from coordinates and velocities selected from an NVT ensemble (details
below), in order to emulate the nascent vibrationally excited SCH3* species that we expect would
be formed upon hydrogen atom addition to SCH)p. (In the canonical (NVT) ensemble, amount of
substance (N), volume (V) and temperature (T) are conserved.) MD trajectories were propagated
in order to observe the fraction of trajectories in which prompt methyl formation was observed
prior to the establishment of thermal equilibrium.

The procedure we used to carry out these MD simulations was as follows: A 1.6 us (1 fs
time step) NVT simulation of SCH3 was carried out using a Langevin thermostat with a
friction coefficient of 10ps! and heat bath of 1300K (a typical temperature at which carbon
etching is observed experimentally under [8] CVD growth conditions). Temperature equilibration
was achieved within a few picoseconds, after which time coordinates and velocities from this
