The minute study of the exact relation between magnitude of stimulus and of
response will require detailed investigation. At the present stage I shall confine my
remarks to one or two principal points. The statement of evident fact that increasing strength of exciting current evokes
increasing strength of blaze can be at once made more precise by the statement that
the latter increases more rapidly than the former, at least within the considerable
range of what may be termed excitation of medium strength, so that a curve of
blaze effects plotted as ordinates with strength of excitation along the abscissa, is
concave towards the base, and appears to rise convex towards an asymptote, the
position of which one is tempted to determine on the assumption that the curve is
logarithmic. 202
