S insects. When the semen is expelled by the Triton at the time of conjugation, it is
5 composed almost entirely of white cord-like, flocculent masses of spermatozoa, which,
= at that moment, exhibit only the faint undulatory motion noticed in them while still
Awithin the deferential vessels. Yet, immediately after these masses are ejected from
© the vessels, and are in contact with water, at the moment of being received into the
S cloaca of the female, as I shall hereafter have occasion to show,—the motions of the
© spermatozoa are not only greatly increased, but that peculiar vibratory ciliary action
S of the tail, which, while the spermatozoa are still within the seminal ducts is very in-
& distinet, and perhaps can scarcely be said to occur—is immediately set up, and the
<= motion of the body of the spermatozoon is changed from the undulatory action before
S observed, to the jerking or watch-spring movement pointed out by observers, and
z thought to be the motion peculiar to the spermatozoon of this class of animals.
S Thus then, the fact of only a slight wavy motion of the spermatozoon being per-
= ceived in some cases, ceases to be of importance, as an argument against the view
5 that motion is closely connected with the function, since it is evident that the true
- Spermatic force is not set up until the spermatozoa have become more or less separated
from each other, through their residence in some fluid vehicle. The movements of
the spermatozoon in insects are very similar to those of the spermatozoon of the
Triton, and the cirenmstances which affect both are in full accordance with the
fact of the existence of, and the necessity for, a distinct liquor seminis, as part of
the normal composition of the seminal fluid, in the Mammalia ; while this portion of
the fluid is not needed, and consequently is almost entirely absent in the Amphibia,
Fishes and most Invertebrata. A comparison of the facts in the two divisions of
animals seems to point to the true nature and use of the liquor seminis, as being that
