parts of magnesium in 100,000 volumes of solution. The mineral, therefore, was
considered to contain 1 per cent. of magnesium. The comparison of the photographs
was made by three independent observers who each gave the same figures* from two
different series of photographs. By simple inspection of the first photograph the
calcium was 8een to be present to the extent of something between 30 and 40 per
cent. of the mineral. The more precise estimation of this mineral pregented some
difficulties, both on account of the mineral containing this element as its chief con-
stituent, and by reason of the fact that dust floating in the air is apt to contaminate
the electrodes with calcium, but not with magnesiam. The hydrochloric acid used
likewise always shows this substance to be present.
