Encoded Genes (PhAPGs) and cotyledon greening [34,54,55]. Data obtained during the last two decades indicate that both
PEP and NEP polymerases are active in all green and non-
green tissues, but with different degrees of activity according
to the developmental stages and physiological conditions
(figure 1). As a matter of fact, Arabidopsis dry seeds already
contain several transcripts of the plastid transcription machin-
ery, such as the NEP RPOT2 and RPOT3, the PEP core rpoA,
rpoB, rpoC1, rpoC2, and the nuclear-encoded PEP-associated
sigma factors SIG2 and SIG5 [48,49]. These PEP core
transcripts derive from chloroplasts present in photosyntheti-
cally active Arabidopsis embryos, before dedifferentiation to
small non-green plastids, termed eoplasts, occurs during late
embryo and seed maturation. In addition, during stratification
(72 hat 4Â°C in the dark) several plastid house keeping genes,
including rpoA, rpoB, rpoC1 and rpoC2, and many nuclear
genes encoding SIG1-6 factors and the RpoTp, RpoTmp


NUCLEAR CONTROL OF PEP ACTIVITY (NCP), a dual-tar- of plastid SIG factors is not conserved among bacteria and chlor-
