recently divided, but as the series of chambers is followed toward the centre the nue
assume an irregular shape, and the red-stained strands appear in the protoplasm abou
them ; gradually the nuclei become more and more irregular, until in the innermost
chambers no nucleus of the rounded form is seen, but in their stead there are the
irregular deeply stained strands. In one large specimen, with forty-seven chambei
no rounded nuclei are visible, and the whole of the stained matter appears to consis
of the irregular strands.
It has been stated that the rounded nuclei have not been observed in the termins
chambers, but this is not the case with the strands. Though in the majority of cases
these are most abundant in the chambers in which the rounded nuclei lie, in other
they are found in the terminal chambers, and in one specimen they are seen to be
closely massed in the terminal chamber.
To repeat, the facts which the preparations show are these :â€”
1, The irregular strands may be seen continuous with the rounded nuclei.
2. In a single specimen all transitions are found between the rounded nuclei a
the irregular strands.
3. While in some specimens, and especially young ones, only rounded nuclei a
present and no strands, in others the reverse is the case, only strands being prese
and no nuclei.
It appears probable that while in young specimens the nuclear material is in tb
form of rounded bodies multiplying by simple division, it is gradually dispersed throug
the protoplasm in the form of these irregular strands.
[Since this was written I have examined specimens of the microspheric form in the
reproductive stage which is briefly described in Postscript 2, at the end of this Paper.
At the beginning of the process there described, before the protoplasm |
