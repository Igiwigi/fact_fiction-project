Similarly to Panchanathan & Boyd [47], we consider
ephemeral groups of agents that interact repeatedly during
each time period and are then reshuffled. We find that while reputation alone mildly increases
cooperation, and punishment alone does not, the two mech-
anisms synergistically interact, leading to high cooperation. Our findings stem from the fact that reputation emerges as
a partial substitute for punishment, thus making all types
of punishment less necessary. Our results indicate a way
through which social groups can sustain cooperation despite
the presence of anti-social punishment.

2. The model

A fully-mixed population of N agents play the OPGG in ran-
domly chosen groups of n > 4 as in Hauert [11].
