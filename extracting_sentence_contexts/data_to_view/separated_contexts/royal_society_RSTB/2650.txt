W. J. RUSSELL ON THE ACTION OF WOOD ON

in producing pictures on a photographic plate in the dark, consequently it seems
probable that the resin in the wood is indirectly the cause of the picture. That it is
not a case of radio-activity appears to be proved, for a glass or mica screen of one-
thousandth of an inch in thickness entirely protects the plate from being acted on. This great difference between the action of the spring and autumn rings in the Scotch
and other pines seems at first difficult to explain, but the following facts throw some light
on the matter and may help to an explanation. It is difficult to imagine that in the
soft porous white wood there should be sufficient resinous mattgr to make it active,
and at the same time resin should be entirely absent from the dark rings, yet that is
what the photographs indicate. It is, however, not difficult to show that resin is
contained in the dark rings, for if the material forming these rings be carefully cut
out so as to separate them entirely from the white wood, and then treated with
hot alcohol, the filtered solution on evaporation leaves a residue of resinous matter,
which acts strongly on a photographic plate.
