In the column region these granules
alter the tone due to the overlying ectodermal brown to a dusky hue. In the capitu-
lum and tentacles, the relative absence of brown and the intensity of melanic de-
position gives the grey and black appearance. This variety corresponds in fact to the
superposition of two varieties, a simple brown and a simple grey described next. Ficure 3. Transverse section of wall of brown with grey Metridium showing base of a mesentery
