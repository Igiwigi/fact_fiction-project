Tf we take into consideration the amount of growth in several of the cases on April 28,
It will be seen how great must have been the subsequent decomposition s0 entirely to
# rid of the organic matter. It is worthy of remark, that, in a few instances, the sulphuric acid in the bottle D,
fig. 8, Plate I., became coloured slightly brown, indicating the passage into it, through
the oxalic acid, of 80me carbon-compound more complicated than carbonic acid. In the
course of other parts of our investigation, we have observed phenomena indicative of a
8milar result ; but as we have not followed up the subject, we leave it with only this

_ Femark as to the fact of what we have observed.
