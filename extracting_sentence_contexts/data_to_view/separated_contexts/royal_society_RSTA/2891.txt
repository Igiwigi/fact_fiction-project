The agreement between the numbers in columns (5) and (6) seems good enough to
warrant the conclusion that the assumption of double* molecules ionised into 10 ions
is not incompatible with the facts. On the other hand, it may be pointed out that
the deviation from the theoretical Boy.x’s law osmotic pressure may be considerable,
for it is apparent in cane-sugar solutions even down to some 7 atmospheres pressure ;
in view of the uncertainty of the value of the conductivities at infinite dilution,
together with the weakness of the theory which connects them with the conduc-
tivities of the solutions themselves, it was considered useless to attempt to correct for
these deviations. Reviewing the evidence recorded in this communication, it may be concluded that
the calcium and strontium salts are proved to be associated when in solution, and it is
possible that they exist as the double molecules of the formula given on p. 335.
