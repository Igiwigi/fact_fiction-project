Is a paper by Professor W. TnowsoN © On the Theory of the Electric Telegraph,” com-
municated to the Royal Society in 1855, the peculiar cireumstances affecting submarine
wires were especially analysed, and it is probable that all the laws regulating the trans-
mission of ignals could, by further development, be deduced from the mathematical
theory there stated, if the necessary constants were known.

It is hoped that some account of an experimental research into the same subject may
be found interesting, especially as the experiments not only confirmed the conclusions
arrived at by Professor W. THoMs0Nn, but led also to the discovery of several facts of
considerable practical importance.

With the view of elucidating the present subject, many experiments have been made
on the charge and discharge observable at the near end of a cable; but although this
charge is intimately connected with the retardation of signals, the connexion is compli-
cated, and many false deductions have been drawn from the facts observed.

The author preferred to make his experiments on the signal or current actually
received at the far end of the wire, the object being to establish a direct relation between
the causes operating at one end and the effects observed at the other. Some experi-
ments of this kind have also been made, but the instruments used have been such as
could only indicate some one point of the complete phenomenon, such as the presence
