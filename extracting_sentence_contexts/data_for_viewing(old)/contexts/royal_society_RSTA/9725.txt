actual proportionality factor is two. This suggests that the effect of the metal ions
must also be taken into account, but here again we can understand why the freezing
point depression is so small in the system silver-gold where the ions have the same
charge.
If the above general idea is accepted, there will be two extremes in this kind of
equilibrium. Where the atomic size factors are markedly unfavourable, the atomic
factor is predominant, and the classical methods may be applied as in the work of
Jererery. At the other extreme, when the atomic size factors are favourable, and the
solvent and solute are in the same period, the equilibrium is essentially electronic and
ionic, and the classical equations require modification* to allow for the fact that the
electrons form a degenerate system. In between these extremes are systems such as
copper-tin and silver-gallium, where the size factors are near the critical limit,
and the whole position becomes more confused. The fact that in these and
other systems the experimental work leads to the conception of liquidus and solidus
factors which are whole numbers suggests clearly that there is some kind of electronic
quantum equilibrium. It is this fact which makes us consider a purely ionic explanation
to be improbable. An assumption that the depression of the freezing point was pro-
portional to the repulsion between an ion of the solvent and one of the solute, and the
depression of the melting point proportional to the repulsion between two solute ions
would account for the relations in the periods, but would give no reason for the whole
number factors in other relations. An electronic explanation, on the other hand, does
not suffer from this disadvantage, since the electrons in different atoms are in different
energy states.
