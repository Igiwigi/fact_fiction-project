J during the few last years, still presents to its cultivators several |
Z interesting objects, both of analytic and synthetic inquiry.

Z by the influence which the discovery would have on the general |

3 individual facts. The theory of the formation of acids, for ex-

EZ ample, one of the most important parts of the new system of

E chemistry, must be regarded as incomplete, and liable to sub-

V version, till the individual acids now alluded to have been

S resolyed into their constituent principles. To the best of my

E knowledge, however, we are not in possession of a single fact

a that gives the smallest insight into the constitution of the
