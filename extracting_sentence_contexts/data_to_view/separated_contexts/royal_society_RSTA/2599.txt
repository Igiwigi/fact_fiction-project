(iii) The boat method of the present paper is a very direct one. and it is hard to
see where it can have gone astray, unless conditions at the gas/liquid interface are
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable results of the
boat method are approximately confirmed by the rougher, but all-fluid, photo-electric
method. Results by the latter are from 10-20 per cent. higher instead of lower than
those by the boat method.
