Except for the fact that the cells of Euglena are capable of free movement, the
aggregation of the particles of a precipitate appears to be similar to the aggregation of
living Euglene.

Figs. 15 and 16 show the aggregations formed when dead cells of Euglena are
treated as precipitates; in fig. 15 the Euglenz are aggregating from a rather loose
surface film, in fig. 16 from a firmer and more coherent film. These figures, and
figs. 17 (manganese dioxide) and 30 (osmic dioxide), resemble very closely the
aggregation of living Euglene in fig. 10. In fig. 44 is shown the aggregation of
Chlamydomonas killed in a solution of osmic acid.

The aggregation of these various sediments appears to depend upon the fact that
a thin film of particles, together with the surface layer of water in which they are
contained, acts as a liquid heavier than water. The aggregation is brought about
therefore not by the action of gravity upon the separate particles but upon the
mixture of particles and water as a whole, just as would be the case if we were
dealing with a homogeneous liquid heavier than water. Thus if we fill a shallow
vessel with water and then drop into it a small quantity of ink the ink sinks in the
water and spreads out to form a layer over the bottom of the vessel. If this is now
carefully closed with a glass plate so that no air bubbles are left in the water and
then turned gently upside down, the layer of ink will at once begin to sink and
a network like aggregation will be produced resembling very closely that shown in
figs. 16, 17, 30, and 32, or if a circular vessel be used those shown in figs. 34, 38, and
40. Instead of ink a mixture of one of the sediments.mentioned above and water
