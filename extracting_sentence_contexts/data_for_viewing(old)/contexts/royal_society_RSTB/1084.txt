gis case a careful examination of a number of sections taken through this region

that the cells of Drrrers’ nucleus on the side of the lesion were either entirely
br were greatly reduced in number ; and the whole appearance of the tegmentum

$ point indicated some traumatic lesion connected with the removal of the

be. (Plate 66, fig. 3.)

Svould again call attention to the fact that in the case of complete cerebellar

ation no such tract of degeneration was discoverable in the spinal cord, and the

‘Derrers’ nucleus were normal ; and a similar healthy appearance was observ-

in another case of extirpation of the lateral lobe (Exp. 5). (Plate 66, fig. 2.)

svidence, therefore, is in favour of the tract in question being dependent upon

tion of the cells of Derrers’ nucleus. It is, however, our intention to further

ite our researches on this point.
