This consideration suggests that a finer subdivision of the year is necessary ; that
months or even weeks should be treated separately. From the agricultural and meteoro-
logical point of view there is everything to be said for such subdivision ; it raises, how-
ever, new mathematical difficulties ; for whereas the evaluation of determinants of 6 rows
and columns, or the solution of simultaneous linear equations in 6 unknowns is sufficiently
rapid, disproportionate labour is involved in increasing the 6 to 12, and if 52 unknowns
were attempted the labour involved would become fantastic.

A consideration which has been still more influential in framing our method is that
even if we were to calculate the 52 partial regression coefficients showing the average
effect in bushels per acre of an extra inch of rainfall, for each week of the year, such a
calculation would leave out of consideration the all-important fact that this effect
may be expected to change continuously during the year. The true partial regression
coefficients for neighbouring periods must be relatively alike. The method of partial
correlation as hitherto developed, takes no account of the serial character of our weather
variates ; after calculating the partial regression coefficients, we should still be far from
the facts, if we did not smooth the series so obtained by a continuous curve, which
should average out the independent errors in the values obtained for the successive
weeks.

Disregarding, then, both the arithmetical and the statistical difficulties, which a direct
attack on the problem would encounter, we may recognise that whereas with q subdi-
visions of the year, the linear regression equations of the wheat crop upon the rainfall
would be of the form
