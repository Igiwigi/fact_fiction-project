K. B.'P.R.S.-

Read February 25, 1808. Tis facts and rexilts intended to be communicated in this
Paper, are founded upon observations made, during the pre-
sent winter, at the cotton manufactory of Messrs. PuiLies and
Ltzr at'Manchester, where the light obtained by the combus-
tion of the gas from coal is used upon a very large scale; the
apparatus for its production and application having been pre-
pared by me at the works of Messrs. BouLTox, Warr, and Co.
at Soho.
