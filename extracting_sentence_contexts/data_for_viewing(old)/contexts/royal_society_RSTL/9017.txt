"The parallelism of these actions with the progress of infectious disease may be traced
$till further. The *© Times,” for example, of January 17 conteined a letter on typhoid
fever, 8igned * M.D.,” in which occurs the following remarkable statement :—* In one
part of it [Edinburgh], congregated together and inhabited by the lowest of the popu-
lation, there are, according to the Corporation return for 1874, no less than 14,319
houses or dwellings—many under one roof, on the *flat' system—in which there are
no house connexions whatever with the street-sewers, and, consequently, no water-
closets. To this day, therefore, all the excrementitious and other refuse of the inhabi-
tants is collected in pails or pans, and remains in their midst, generally in a partitioned-
off corner of the living-room, until the next day, when it is taken down to the streets
and emptied into the Corporation carts. Drunken and vicious though the population
be, herded together like sheep, and with the filth collected and kept for 24 hours in
their very midst, it is a remarkable fact that typhoid fever and diphtheria are simply
unknown in these wretched hovels.”

'The analogy of this result with the behaviour of our infusions is perfect. On the
30th of November, for example, a quantity of animal refuse, embracing beef, fish,
rabbit, hare, was placed in two large test-tubes opening into a protecting-chamber con-

extract —* Uebrigens kann man sich die in der Atmosphiire schwimmenden Thierchen wie Wolken denken,
mit denen ganz leere Luftmassen, ja ganze Tage yollig reinen Luftverhiiltnisse wechseln.” (EnzexBens, ©Infu-
8ionsthierchen,” 1838, p. 525.) The coincidence of phraseology is surprising, for I knew nothing of Enzex-
BERG's conception. My * clouds,” however, are but s8mall miniatures of his.
