The approximate positions of the three sections are
indicated in the diagram (text-fig. 1). THE PALAOZOIC SEED, LAGENOSTOMA LOMAXI. 199

The lowest section (fig. 3) is across the chalazal region just below the plane in
which the main vascular bundle breaks into its nine radiating strands. The eccentric
position of the fibrous cushion which surrounds the vascular bundle arises from the
fact that the section is not truly at right angles to the axis of the seed, an explanation
holding good in the other two members of the series as well. The section across the
canopy (fig. 1) shows the nine loculiâ€”the radial septa becoming incomplete on that
side of the section which dips to a slightly lower level. Within the canopy, with
cusps corresponding to its folds, lies the wall of the pollen-chamber, and inside this,
like a little circular island, is the transversely cut central cone.
