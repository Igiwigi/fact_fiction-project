The evidence of this
experiment suggests that the latter nucleus is not concerned with the reception of any
fillet fibres. THALAMIC CONNECTIONS IN THE RAT. 9

Summarising, Marchi degeneration in the thalamus is confined on the left side to
the medial medullary lamina and the posterior extremity of the ventral nucleus
(probably fibres of tectal origin), and on the right side to the medial medullary lamina,
caudal extremity of the dorso-medial nucleus, ventral nucleus, and habenular nucleus. No evidence of degeneration extending into the neopallium was anywhere to be found,
in spite of the fact that the caudal pole of the medial geniculate body and the pretectal
nucleus of the left side were injured. All the degenerated fibres which result from
the lesion involving the Whole of the medial lemniscus at the caudo-ventral margin
of the thalamus appear to terminate in the ventral nucleus. Rat Th. 2, fig. 9.â€”In this experiment, the needle was passed through the left
frontal cortex in a direction passing caudally and to the right, and with a slight ventral
inclination.
