This is true even
if this better information leads to no mitigative action, and hence to no reduction in the final
level of climate change damages. Better information allows us to improve our preparation for the
eventual outcome, whether that be good or bad, and Freeman et al. [26] assess the value that this
provides to society.

3. The dragons of uncertainty: human behaviour and the effects of uncertainty

The articles discussed thus far converge on the fairly compelling conclusion that scientific and
policy uncertainty need not be a barrier to actionâ€”on the contrary, the articles underscore the fact
that when the implications of uncertainty are formally analysed, they provide an added impetus
for concern and hence for climate mitigation. We noted at the outset that appeals to uncertainty are often cited as reasons to delay
action in political discourse and public debate. The article by Oreskes [39] contributes another
historical case study of how uncertainty might lead to inaction.
