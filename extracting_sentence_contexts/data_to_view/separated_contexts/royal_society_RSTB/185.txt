134 and
& 144), and their appearances have been rendered familiar by KÃ©ttrKer,} Uskow, and
g others. Taken alone, they suggest that the heart lies in a separate and distinct
g chamber of its own; but such an idea is shown to be erroneous, both by earlier
= embryos and by the other sections through the iter. The appearance seems due to
% the fact that in the cardiac region the halves of the ccelom have already coalesced,
2 whilst behind they are still apart ; so that, in consequence, the splanchnopleure which
ES spreads outwards from one to the other envelops the venous end of the heart
EB (fig. 144), and thus seems to form a closed chamber for it.

2 Soon after the heart has become an unpaired organ the ventral wall of the cardiac

chamber alters so much that the share the splanchnopleure has in its formation is
less obvious. It seems reasonable to infer that, inasmuch as its ventral boundary wall
is covered with hypoblast, therefore it is of splanchnic origin, and this is borne
out by the younger embryos (figs.
