First, observe that both oj, > 0 and o9 > 0—the first relation comes from the Euler-Lagrange
equation while the second can be derived either by direct computation or through the Euler-
Lagrange equation. Next, we observe that Wea > 0a.e., which follows from the convexity of Wye!
and can also be explicitly computed. Hence, using that oj, > 0,00 > 0, W/.,, = 0 we see that all the
terms on the l.h.s. of (4.3) are non-negative, in particular Io° 2ash~ wer dr Ss Is? wpr dr, which by
Hélder’s inequality implies [j° #rdr < a5 24, which in turn shows that the rhs. in (4.3) is at
most of order h?.

As the r.h.s. in (4.2) is bounded by the l.h.s. in (4.3), we see that

F1,(G0,0) — Fy,(in,@n) — DF y(n, ®n) « (80 — Tp, Dy) S HP.

Using that DF),(0;,,©),) =0, we get that F),(v9,0) — Fy (tp, @p) S i?. The trivial fact that F),(v,0) >
F),(¥p, ®,) (which holds as F),(vj,, Wp) is the minimum over a larger class of test functions) permits
us to conclude (3.8).

The rh.s. in (4.3) being < h? also implies {5° wy? rdr <1, which by an interpolation inequality
