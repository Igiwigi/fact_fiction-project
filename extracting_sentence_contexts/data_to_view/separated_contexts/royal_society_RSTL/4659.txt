Received November 14, 1850, â€”Read January 16, 1851. IN these communications, Sir Joun HEeRsCHEL shows, that if the component members
of a double star occupy a certain position with reference to the pole of the ecliptic,
and one of them be supposed to be situated within a given distance from the earth,
a change will be periodically produced in the angle of position, and in the distance of
the two stars forming the double star, consequent on the motion of the earth in her
orbit; that the maximum of the change in the angle of position will occur at two
periods of the year distant from each other about six months; and he gives formulz
by which the epochs at which that maximum occurs may be computed, and by which
the amount of parallax due to a given change in the angle of position may be also
found for each star ; also lists of stars favourably situated for the investigation of that
element, with the times of the year at which they should be observed, and the amount

- of parallax, which an observed change of 30' in the angle of position would indicate
in the case of each star. On the erection of my observatory in the autumn of 1842, comprising among its
instruments an equatoreal of very considerable power, I determined to employ it in
the obseryations of the double stars contained in these lists, with the view of ascer-
taining whether they exhibited such decided differences in their positions, when ob-
Served at the proper periods, as to give good grounds of hope that some definite
conclusion might be arrived at, as to the existence of a parallax in the objects ob-
served, capable of being measured, or at the least, confidently announced as subsist-
ing in fact.

334 LORD WROTTESLEY ON THE PERIODICAL OBSERVATION OF STARS

In conducting the observations, however, difficulties arose that had not been anti-
cipated : Sir Joun Herscners lists contain sixty-nine stars; many of these, at the
periods announced in the lists as proper for observation, if observed at all, must be
observed at distances from the meridian too great, when the delicate nature of the
inquiry is considered ; many of them, having south or small northern declinations,
are near the horizon when the proper period for their observation arrives.
