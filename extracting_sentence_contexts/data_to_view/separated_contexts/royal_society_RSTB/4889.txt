These methods are designated on Table XXV as B, M and T respec-
tively. In method B the basis of the method is oxygen. The method, which is in
principle, very similar to one previously described by Frepertcra, gives satisfactory
results during rest and on most persons; its principal drawback lies in the fact that
during exercise the subject is likely to have his power of carrying out the details of
the experimental procedure impaired. While the test appears to give a correct
answer, and while all the corrections have been carefully worked out, there yet seems
to be some doubt as to whether the equilibrium set up in the lung is not a somewhat
artificial one. The method of Mraxtys and Davtss is based on the CO, estimations.
