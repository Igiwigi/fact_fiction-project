These corrections vary between each satellite mission, aes)
must be independently evaluated and led to the requirement that the altimetry missions must ,
overlap [68]. An important final check that errors in the corrections do not introduce errors into
the altimetric long-term trend is to compare the altimeter time series with those from a selection of
tide gauges distributed throughout the world [69]. In fact, the frequently reported uncertainty of
0.4mm per year on the global trend is primarily associated with this check on altimeter drift [70]. This check is not perfect, in that not all of the tide gauges have GNSS measurements of vertical
land (crustal) motion. This motion could introduce a systematic error into the analysis, though a
recent study suggested that this globally averaged error should be less than 0.6 mm per year [71],
which is also an independently estimated altimetric trend error [72].
