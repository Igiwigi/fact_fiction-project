(Leyden, 1867), and deduced therefrom the resulting identities. The only formuli 0
obtained which appeared of interest were, in fact, those which are given in the present
paper, viz. (18) to (23); but at the time I was not aware of their connexion with the
theory of Elliptic Functions. It was only recently, after obtaining the values of
8n am  &c. in (10) to (17), that I remarked that the resulting identities were the same
as those which I had previously deduced by the aid of Sir W. Tnowsox's principle.
