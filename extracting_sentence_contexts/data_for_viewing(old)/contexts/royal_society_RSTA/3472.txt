More recently, Smith & Stassun [36] have examined the implications of revised distances to
some Galactic LBVs as listed in the Gaia DR1. A surprising result was that the canonical LBV star
AG Carinae is actually at a much closer distance than previously thought, which lowers its true
luminosity by about a factor of 10. This would move it way off the S Doradus instability strip on
the HR diagram (figure 1). This is potentially a big problem for the traditional view of LBVs as
massive single stars in transition to the WR phase. While the Gaia DR1 distances to these LBVs
are still considered tentative [36], one may anticipate that the second data release from Gaia might
shake things up even more.


(c) An alternative evolutionary view ls |

The fact that LBVs are more isolated than WR stars, plus the fact that some stars appear to

remain in an LBV phase until death as SNe IIn, suggests an entirely different picture. Instead 3
of the monotonic evolutionary scheme for single stars, the spatial distributions of LBVs suggest 1s

that massive star populations and especially LBVs are dominated by bifurcated evolutionary
trajectories:

WN WC-=SN Ibc_ (donor)
LBV/B[e] > SN IIn (gainer).
