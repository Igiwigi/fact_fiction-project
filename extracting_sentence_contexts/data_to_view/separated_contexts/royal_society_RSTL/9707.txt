We conjecture that it signifies extension of katelectrotonic
influence in the previously anelectrotonic region (physiological) with increasing strength
of the galvanic current. The increased excitability is in the polar region, the excita-
tion is in the peripolar region in which excitability is diminished. But apart from its
theoretical import, we lay stress on the fact as showing augmentation of excitability
in the presence of opposed electromotive forces. We may observe further that with
strong induction currents it does not appear, that with subminimal induction currents
the increase is alone seen and only with greater strength of the galvanic current, and
that exceptionally with induction currents of moderate strength the increase brought
about by the galvanic current appears without previous decrease. In seeking confirmation of the hypothesis applied to the fact expressed in the
preceding statement, we were led to look for an analogous effect with the combined
induction kathode and galvanic anode, and found ourselves entitled to qualify
statement, 4 by the following statement :â€”
