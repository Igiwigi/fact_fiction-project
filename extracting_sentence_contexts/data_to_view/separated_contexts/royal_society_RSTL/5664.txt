But the pro-
Bquction of an acid containing CÂ® merely rendered it probable that the rue oil did not
Zcontain less than 20 equivalents of carbon ; it was no proof that it did not contain more. S In fact, the action of nitric acid varies with its concentration. 5 Guided by ideas which need not now be detailed, 1 made in 1853 some experiments,
E with the intention of obtaining from oil of rue certain bodies of the capric series, but
they only served to convince me that the views then entertained regarding the consti-
= tution of the oil were erroneous. Some curious reactions were observed, but the expe-
& riments diverging into other channels have not, as yet, been renewed.
