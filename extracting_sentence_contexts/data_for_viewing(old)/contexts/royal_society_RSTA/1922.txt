Figure 8. The horizontal and vertical Stokes drift velocities for a porous layer with linearly-varying permeability, as in
equation (4.1).

interface which is a constant «*. Likewise, all of the other constants of equation (3.3) remain the
same. Furthermore, inspecting the form of the Stokes drift velocity expressions in both layers,
the drift velocities at a fixed value of z in the lower porous layer are unchanged by modifying
the thickness of the upper porous layer, a fact shown in figure 4.

(ii) Varying permeability of the upper porous layer

If we instead fix d* = 0.10 m, and vary the permeability of the upper porous layer, we obtain effects
throughout the profile, because the dispersion relation will change. Letting «* — 0, we recover the


classical results for a fluid of depth d, as derived by Stokes [1], because the upper layer becomes
an impermeable boundary. The vertical drift is therefore zero in this case because the waves are
not damped. Vertical drift effects increase with the increasing permeability of this layer, because
more and more flow can be exchanged between the two flow regimes, as shown in figure 5.
