that the Egyptian embalmers ' were acquainted with 'an
important physiological truth, namely, that in order to pro-
mote the absorption of liquid substances, particularly of the
tanning liquor and saline solution, applied "to the external
surface of the body, the cuticle must first be removed.

The' presence of saline -substances in mummies has‚Äù been
noticed by more than one modern writer, especially by Mons:
Rover, already mentioned in the course of this essay ; but
the conjecture as to the origin of the salts themselves, has not
been hinted at before.

A fourth fact, deserving of our attention, is the presence of
a resino-bituminous substance between some of the folds of
the remaining portions of the peritoneal membrane. On col-
lecting this substance, and instituting some experiments upon
it, I ascertained that the bitumen was mixed with a greater
proportion of wax, 80 as to have rendered the mixture per-

lodged between closely adhering membraneous folds, this mix-
ture must either have been injected/quite warm into the cavity
of the abdomen, or the- body itself must have' been plunged
intoa vessel containing aliquefied mixture of wax and bitumen,
and there kept for some hours or days, over a gentle fire.
The latter operation, not noticed by. the: older historians, has
