of these; one more is seen in the valley, and one in the above-mentioned falls,
These vary in width, across their outcrops, from 20 feet to 700 feet,

The principal band No. 3 (see fig. 8), along which the most important mines are
situated, is some 300 feet in width and, as far as it can be traced out, extends in a
sinuous line from Dattau through the end of Letnytaung spur, on the edge of Mogok
valley, onwards in a westerly direction through Bobadaung. There it curves in a
south-westerly direction past Pyanbin to Pingu hill, where its course is altered to
the north-westward as far as Bolong. From thence it passes through Welloo and
Kyaukmyo to Kabein.

Beyond this westwards there was no attempt made to fully investigate the lime-
stone band further; in fact, had time allowed, the work would have been almost
rendered impossible, owing to the trackless nature of the great forest-covered
mountains of this portion of the district. In places, however, where some of the
bands crossed the roadway onwards, they were noted; and I found that (as before-
mentioned) one band, after curving to the northward in the neighbourhood of
Wapudoung, became almost horizontal, forming, with but one exception, the surface
rock along the road nearly to Thebayetkin (see map, fig. 11).

Although these bands are somewhat parallel to each other in parts, they are not
so in others, and it would be impossible to expect much regularity in their relations
to each other, or much conformity in the width of each for any distance, associated
as they are with a class of rock which must have been subjected to considerable
disturbance and displacement. In all cases their dips are conformable to the
