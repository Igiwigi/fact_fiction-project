Corollary 2.22. (Corollary 1 of the claim) The above claim is also true if the linearly independent (1 x n)
vectors {(v')',...,(vâ„¢)'} in R" serve as common left eigenvectors of the matrix operators A and B.

Corollary 2.23. (Corollary 2 of the claim) If each of the matrices A and B has n linearly independent 8
eigenvectors (i.e.m =n) and if all these n eigenvectors are shared by A and B, then the matrix operators A :y
and B commute (i.e. AB = BA). 2

Remark 2.24. The following two observations are made from the above analysis: 3S

(i) From corollaries 2.21 and 2.23, it follows that, for a sequence of measure-preserving and
weak-mixing PFSA, the state transition probability matrices tend to commute. Therefore,
the norms of commutators of the state transition matrices are expected to be relatively
small. In view of the fact that ergodicity is a mild relaxation of weak mixing [32], it
is conjectured that the commutator norm of the evolving state transition probability
matrices would be relatively small for ergodic and measure-preserving PFSA.

(ii) While the state space of a dynamical system can be partitioned to make the constructed
symbolic system be ergodic in the nominal phase, one may encounter cases where the
symbolic system is only recurrent (but not necessarily ergodic) in the nominal phase; in
those cases, there will be a subset of symbols B, where B C A, that are persistently visited
in the nominal phase. However, if the subset A\B of symbols is never visited during the
nominal phase, the symbolic system restricted to B could still be ergodic in the nominal
phase. In either case, whether the nominal-phase of the symbolic system is ergodic on
its own or after restriction, choosing a reference state transition matrix for computing the
commutator norm from the nominal phase would make the commutator norm expected
