bergia,” that is, “the species with solitary sporangia are older than those in which
the sporangia appear gathered in irregular groups.” I do not think that this can be
accepted as a general statement of a morphological progression. It appears to be
based upon observation of two genera only, important and early though they certainly
are. Before it can be considered as established on paleontological grounds alone, the
absence of ferns with clearly defined sori of prior date and of reasonably close affinity
would need to be demonstrated ; but it is to be remarked that various genera with
definite sori (¢.g., Oligocarpia, Succopteris) are recorded by Srur himself from the
same strata as Hapalopteris, and even Danqites, which has a most compact and
circumscribed type of sorus, is accepted by him as simultaneous with that genus.
The question of time and mode of origin of the definite sorus would thus appear to be
still an open one; the paleontological facts are not sufficient to justify a general
statement on the point, in view specially of the fact that there is evidence of ferns
with considerable variety of structure having existed at the time of the Culm and in
the Devonian period.

The form of the sorus in the Marattiacere when it is circumscribed, varies consider-
ably, though, as above noted, its plan of construction is remarkably uniform, being
of the radiate uniseriate type. It may be almost perfectly circular (Asterotheca,
Scolecopteris), or more or less elongated (Kaulfussia, Marattia, Angiopteris), or
elongated to a very considerable extent (Danwa, Danqites). It would appear that
very much the same extreme variations of form of the sorus are found among the
early fossil Marattiaceze as in those of the present day: but there is not sufficient
evidence to show on paleontological grounds how far the two types are related by
descent, and if they be so, which type, the circular or the elongated, was the prior,
