when the yelk-contractions were vigorous, the heart was beating regularly, and the
trunk frequently moving; a few circulating corpuscles were seen. After 64 hours the
heart was still, the trunk was not seen to struggle, nor could I by using the micrometer
thread detect any yelk-contractions.

Experiment 7 was similar to the aboye, using two healthy eggs 174 hours after im-
pregnation, when the heart was acting vigorously, the stream of blood was seen entering
the auricular opening, the trunk often moved, and the yelk contractions were well Seen.
After 74 hours the movement had ceased in one egg, in the heart, trunk, and yelk. Tn the
other the heart was moving slowly, and feeble trunk-movements were seen, but n0 yelk-
contractions. In this egg the heart was irregularly and slowly acting after twelve Hours.
After eighteen hours all was still. "The discrepancy which this result shows as com-
pared with experiment g, is explained by the fact that there were several deaths in the
dishes from which the eggs were taken, and some parasitic growth on the yelk-sacs,

which I neglected to wash off in the case of experiment 9, but carefully attended to Å¿in
experiment 7, in which instance I also selected the eggs under a lens.

i ment $8 was similar to the above, using two free embryos hatched twenty-four
10urs-previously. The beating of the heart was regular, 112 per minute, the blood was
lating vigorously, no yelk-contractions being seen, and as yet no movement of the
I-covers. After three hours the heart's action was reduced to ninety per minute, the
