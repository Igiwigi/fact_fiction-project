well-specified computational architecture, the unified theory
of mind and brain suggests several targets of opportunity
for intervention and treatment.

First, depression may be relieved by directly affecting the
descending allostatic predictions that originate in agranular
limbic cortices. For example, deep brain stimulation in the
region of the subcallosal (agranular) anterior cingulate may
achieve its antidepressant effects [222-224] via its ability to
alter allostatic predictions to the body and brain. Indeed, the
effectiveness of Maybergâ€™s intracranial stimulation for untrea-
table depression could be due to the fact that it affects three
white matter tracts (the cingulum bundle, the forceps minor
and the uncinate fasciculus [225]), thereby modifying the con-
nectivity within and between the default mode and salience
networks.

Second, according to the unified theory, depression can
arise from the effects of chronic, aberrant allostatic predictions
leading to or resulting from HPA-axis dysregulation and
inflammation. This suggests that interventions to address
these systemic affects should help to slow the onset and inten-
sity of depression. Indeed, recent efforts have explored the
antidepressant effects of cortisol synthesis inhibitors [226,227]
