The overall diamicton texture and the absence of silt or sand DNS
lags indicated slow basal water flow, even during the episodic lake filling and draining events a
documented [36,60]. Porosity and water content were notably higher in the upper 40cm than [3S
in the more consolidated till below [59]. Fossil diatoms and other microfossils and particulates .
derived from older marine sediment were rare and fragmented in all SLW sediments, despite the

fact that the source rocks that make up the till include a significant marine component. When
compared with tills collected further upstream from beneath the WIS [61,62], the relative lack of

diatoms in the SLW sediments was interpreted largely as a result of mechanical degradation, from

both subglacial shear strain in deforming till and long-distance transport from their upstream

source rocks [63,64]. In the SLW sediments, many of the fossil siliceous sponge spicules are of the class
Hexactinellida.
