of the heart is considered, it will be found to derive its nervous
influence'from every part of the neryous system, and not very

ments.

From the same facts we explain, why the heart is stimulated
through the nervous system after the power of this svstem
is 80 far weakened as no longer to convey the effect'of the
stimulus to the muscles of voluntary motion. As these obey
stimuli applied to only one part of the nervous system, if the
change in this part is not strong enough to produce the effect,
it cannot be assisted by any other. Thus I have found by
experiment, that a blow which affects the brain generally,
without materially injuring it, produces comparatively little
effect on the muscles of yoluntary motion, because no one
part suffers greatly, but it produces a great effect 'on the
heart, because it feels the sum of all the impressions. The
nervous system, therefore, may be so far exhausted as not to
