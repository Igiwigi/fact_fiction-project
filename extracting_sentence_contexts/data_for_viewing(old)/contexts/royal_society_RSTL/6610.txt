ciable difference has in any instance been found in the deflection. The direction remains
the same; and the value unaltered. So that the currents, as far as the polarizing of the
plates is concerned, may be regarded as true and proper earth-currents.

The alterations in direction of the currents and the yarying yalues in either direction
indicate that they are in nowise due to the mere electromotive force of the earth-plates
employed.

I have mentioned in my former communication (pp. 94, 95) that the connexion with
the earth is very frequently made by means of the fish-jointed rails. Some misgivings
might arise on a first glance as to the influence of this arrangement oyer the results.
The current collected under such circumstances, however, would be true in direction, but
reduced in value. We need not enter into the discussion of this question from the fact
that no such carth-connexion has been required for our present purposes.

To prevent misapprehension, I haye thought it better to give a list of the earth-con-
nexion employed at all the stations concerned in this investigation,

London. . . . . . . Gas-pipes; and a lightning conductor terminating in a wet
pit of coke.

Tonbridge. . . . . . Gas and water-pipes.

Hastings . . - - -Â» Gas: and water-pipes.
