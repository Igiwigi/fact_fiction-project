The usual way is
to call the probability in the initial collective the a priori, and that in the derived collective
the a posteriori probability. This usage exactly parallels von Neumannâ€™s. To continue:

The fact that these expressions suggest a connexion with a well-known philosophical
terminology is their first deficiency in my eyes. Another one is that these same expressions,
a priori and a posteriori, are used in the classical theory of probability in a different sense as
well, namely, to distinguish between probabilities derived from empirical data and those
assumed on the basis of some hypothesis; such a distinction is not pertinent in our theory. I prefer, therefore, to give to the two probabilities less pretentious names, which have less
far-reaching and general associations.
