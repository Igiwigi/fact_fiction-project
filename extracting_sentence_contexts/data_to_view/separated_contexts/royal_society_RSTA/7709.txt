At a point on the group-ray between J and D in fig. 11(a) the direction of motion of
individual wave-crests across the wave-packet is more inclined to the vertical than the
direction of motion of the wave-packet as a whole. When the wave-packet has reached
the point D, individual wave-crests are travelling across it horizontally although the
wave-packet as a whole is still moving upwards. Along the portion DA of the group-ray
the direction of motion of the wave-packet as a whole continues to slope upwards in
spite of the fact that the direction of motion of individual wave-crests across it is now
sloping downwards. After the wave-packet has passed its highest point A, both the
direction of motion of the wave-packet as a whole and the direction of motion of
individual wave-crests across it have downward slopes, which tend to identity as the
wave-packet approaches the point R where it leaves the ionosphere. There is a corre-
sponding interpretation of fig. 11(b): when the wave-packet is between B and E its
direction of motion as a whole has a downward slope whereas the direction of motion
of individual wave-crests across it has an upward slope.

4, LATERAL DEVIATION

The group of waves represented by the integral (10) does not represent a wave-packet
which is limited in all directions.
