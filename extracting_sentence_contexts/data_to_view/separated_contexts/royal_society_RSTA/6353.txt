I conclude with a discussion of how the OSNAP float
program results aid our understanding of AMOC variability.

(a) Sorting out the linkage between convective activity and Atlantic meridional
overturning circulation variability

At the initiation of OSNAP, a question loomed as to whether or not boundary current variability
reflected AMOC variability in the subpolar North Atlantic. We can now state with confidence
that a measure of variability at any one subpolar boundary is insufficient to yield the total AMOC
variability [39], nor can any one boundary in OSNAP East or OSNAP West capture a significant
fraction of MOC variability across their respective sections. In large part, this insufficiency can
be attributed to the fact that the swift cyclonic boundary current rimming the sub-basins of the
subpolar North Atlantic is advecting anomalies formed in one part of the basin to other parts of
the basin or from one basin to the next, as demonstrated in a recent modelling study [70]. In this
regard, the subpolar gyre is remarkably different from the subtropical gyre in that there is strong
variability at a number of boundaries that contribute to the total variability. There was also at the start of the OSNAP a general expectation that convective activity in the
central Labrador basin drove downstream AMOC variability.
