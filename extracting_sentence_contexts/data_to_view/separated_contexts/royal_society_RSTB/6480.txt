INTRODUCTION

The Acanthodian fishes form one of the most sharply demarcated and recognizable
groups of vertebrate fossils. Their characteristic squamation of square, exceedingly
minute ganoid scales, and the fact that all the fins except the caudal fin are supported
by large anterior spines, distinguish them sharply from all other fishes, and enable even
fragmentary specimens to be recognized without doubt. They are worldwide in
distribution, and their range in time is thus known with considerable certainty. The first fragments, attributed on very good evidence to the group, are isolated fin
spines, found in Upper Silurian rocks perhaps not earlier than the Downtonian, which
seem to be identical with those found in complete fishes of Lower Devonian age.
