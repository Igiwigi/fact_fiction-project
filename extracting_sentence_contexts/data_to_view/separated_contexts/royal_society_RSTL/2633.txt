Two springs in
South America, at a distance from any active volcano, have increased in temperature
by 4Â® centigrade since the period of his observations, as determined by M. BovussN-
GAULT. It is a 8ingular fact that we are not only unacquainted with the progressive varia-
tions of temperature in springs during long periods of time, but even with the dinrnal
or monthly changes to which many thermal waters are probably subject. The nsual
Statement of the constaney of the heat of such springs at all seasons is abundantly
general, but perfectly vague. I have reason to believe that, except in the case of
particularly abundant springs, it does not hold true; but I am unacquainted with
any systematic experiments on the snbject, although I have made many inquiries
on the subject in almost every place I have visited where the medicinal importance
of the springs had rendered them objects of attention to physicians or intelligent
persons generally.
