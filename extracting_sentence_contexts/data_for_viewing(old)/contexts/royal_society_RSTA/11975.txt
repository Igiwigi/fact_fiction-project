do not wish at present to anticipate results, which I hope when my investigations
are complete to publish as a whole. The above may suffice to indicate the range of
problems to which a resolution of asymmetrical frequency-curves into normal

(2.) With regard to the method adopted in the memoir itself, I am very conscious

of the defects under which it suffers—the laborious character of the arithmetic
involved, and the question of what may be the probable error of the solution obtained
by the method of higher moments. But I had to deal with the fact that the problem
is one which urgently needed a solution in the case of both economic and biological
statistics. Better solutions than mine may be ultimately found, but although more
than one mathematically trained statistician has for some time recognized the impor-
tance of the problem, no solution, so far as I am aware, has hitherto been forthcoming.

With regard to the amount of error introduced by the use of higher moments, a
word may be said. I have not been able to work out the general problem suggested
to me by Professor Grorce Darwin: “Given the probable error of every ordinate
of a frequency-curve, what are the probable errors of the elements of the two normal
curves into which it may be dissected ?”

I can, however, indicate the sort of differences which are likely to occur in results
