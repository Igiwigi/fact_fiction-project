for different relative values of h,, s,, k and s. Scnuster, however, took no account
of the radiation lost by absorption, whilst (60) with the temperature distribution
given by (50) pays due attention to the radiative equilibrium.

The equation we ultimately make use of is (57). We shall, however, pause to make
a curious deduction from (60) which is of some mathematical interest. Assume that
there is no selective absorption or selective scattering, i.e. m, = 1, », = const. Then
the total emergent radiation is given by

as it should be; the point to notice is that it is constant and independent of ». For
any given 4, however, I, (0) +0 as »>0; it is found in fact from (60) to be of the

order of magnitude of w!. Now as o> 0, s/k > ©. Consequently the result implies
that as the scattering increases relatively to the absorption, any given small portion of
the spectral energy curve tends to approach coincidence with the axis of 2. But the
area included between the whole curve and the axis of 2 remains constant, being equal
to F. What becomes, then, of the characteristic form of the energy curve ? We have
seen that for small amounts of scattering the peak tends to move towards the blue
