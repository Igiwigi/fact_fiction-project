might be interpreted as a precursor to those employed in
stone-knapping [24-27]. This has led to considerable specu-
lation with respect to similarities and differences in the
cognitive and manual abilities implied in the two different
tasks. Several controversial claims have emerged. Wynn &
McGrew [28] for example, wrote ‘all the behaviour that can
be inferred from Oldowan tools falls within the range of the
ape adaptive grade. There is nothing exclusively human-like
about this oldest known archaeological evidence’ (p. 383).
Quite similar statements can be found in the studies of
Davidson & McGrew [25], Joulian [29], Marchant & McGrew
[26] and Wynn [30]. However, other work, relying on the
fact that no great apes appear to have knapped stone as
early hominins did, question such similarities [31-36].

The question is then: does the production of cutting tools
require different skills, and different levels of functional under-
standing than the use of stone hammers to fracture casings of
hard food objects? To the best of our knowledge, no systematic
comparisons of stone-knapping and nut-cracking have been
undertaken. Such a comparison is the purpose of this paper.

Whereas much prior interest has been placed on the
mental operations necessary in these tasks (coordination,
symbolic representation, planning and comprehension of
