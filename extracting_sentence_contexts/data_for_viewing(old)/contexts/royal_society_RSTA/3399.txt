energy eigenstates |v) > |a).

The eigenstates |y¥(I")) of the Hamiltonian H(I’) can be chosen to depend continuously on the
parameter J”, and will converge to the eigenstates of Ho in the limit / — 0. Consequently, if we
write the wavefunctions of the states |y(I”)) in the unpertubed energy eigenbasis

WX) = (xlW(P)),

we expect that these will converge to Kronecker delta functions as |(I")) changes into the
corresponding unperturbed eigenstate |a); this means that the state |y(I")) will be localized for
small I”. In the previous section, we saw that, in the large I" limit, these states are delocalized, so
we expect that there will be a value I, where transition between these two behaviours occurs. In
fact, if we write the Hamiltonian in the eigenbasis of Ho, we get

This is related to the Anderson model that describes a particle hopping on a lattice while under
the effect of a disordered potential. This model is known to enter a localized phase when the
disordered term dominates the hopping term. In equation (4.1), the unperturbed energies {E,} are
the equivalent of a disordered potential, while the values I (a|V|a’) are the hopping coefficients
for the particle. Note that here the underlying geometry of the hopping is defined by the matrix
elements (a|V|a’): sites a,a’ are adjacent (i.e. the particle can hop directly from one to the other) if
and only if (a|V\a’) #0. As r — 0, the hopping is suppressed and the system is likely to enter
a disorder-induced localized phase. In the transverse-field Ising spin glass Hamiltonian (2.1),
