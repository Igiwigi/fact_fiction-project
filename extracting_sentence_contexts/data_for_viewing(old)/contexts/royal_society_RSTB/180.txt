no effect, so far as we could determine, upon the sensibility of the opposite side of the
body, such as we had been led to expect from the experiments of Ferrier would
have been the case. On communicating this result to Professor FrrrrEr, he suggested
that the difference probably arose from the smaller extent of the lesiou, especially
of the uncinate gyrus, as compared with the cases published by him; and we
accordingly in further experiments endeavoured to effect a more complete removal
of that convolution as well as of the hippocampus itself. The result of this was that
in many cases there was produced, as Ferrter has described, a unilateral diminution
of sensibility affecting the whole of the opposite side of the body. This condition of
hemianzsthesia, although fairly well marked, was in our experiments never complete,
nor was it permanent ; and, indeed, in most instances it was found to have disappeared
within a week of the operation. Since even with a tolerably extensive lesion in this
region we were not always able to substantiate the fact that there was a diminution
of sensibility produced, at least on testing the animals some hours after the operation,
and since also, when a distinct effect was obtained, it was comparatively transient, it
was difficult to be certain that the result yielded by the operation was really due to
the removal of a part of the cortex connected with the consciousness of sensations,
and might not be otherwise explained, as we have previously pointed out, by a
disturbance of the function of other parts, which must always be produced by any
extensive cerebral lesion ; and this explanation seems at all events as reasonable as one
which assumes that it is exclusively the region in question which is concerned with
the appreciation of tactile and painful sensibility. Another explanation is, however,
possible, and would equally well fit in with the facts which we have to record. For,
as we shall immediately show, the gyrus fornicatus is certainly connected with the
sensibility of the opposite side of the body. Now the gyrus fornicatus is anatomically
