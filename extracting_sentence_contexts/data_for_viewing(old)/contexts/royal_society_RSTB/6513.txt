The increased length of the cells which undergo auxospore formation becomes clear
from a comparison between the average length of the “double cells”, representing the
maximum length during the cycle of growth and division, and the combined length of
the two arms of cells in the early stage of auxospore formation (fig. 16a, Plate 3).
To give an example: subculture 8’ (line A) showed on 20 March an average diameter
of 19-24, and an average length of the double cells of 139-64”. The average diameter
of cells forming auxospores in the same culture was 19-3, the combined length of the
arms 161-54.

This increase in length is most probably not due to actual growth, an elongation
of the membrane by the formation of new intercalary bands—although such a process
may occur occasionally (see p. 28)—but to the fact that the two halves of the shell
separate farther apart than in cell division. As described on p. 4 cell division and for-
mation of the new valves takes place while the parental membrane remains intact, the
hypotheca being overlapped by the epitheca. In auxospore formation the growth of
the protoplast continues and the thecae are gradually pushed apart.

At the moment of actual separation the bending takes place and the two halves of
the shell become set at an angle one to the other. One might assume that the safne
tension which is present during cell division, and which is there responsible for the
contraction of the daughter protoplasts and the formation of the wide gap between
them (p. 5), also exists during the growth of the cell preceding auxospore formation.
The tension may even become greater, since the growth continues beyond that at cell
division. This increased tension would be responsible for the bending at the moment
