independently of any endocrine influence. On the other hand, male differentiation
is controlled by secretions of the testes. When “‘male hormone”? acts on a developing
female organism, it suppresses the further development of the Miillerian ducts, and
promotes that of the Wolffian system. “Female hormone”’, having no action on the
undifferentiated reproductive organs of a developing female organism, has no power
to alter the course of development of the male accessory organs.

Such differentiation of the Miillerian ducts as the male monkey may show is as
readily understandable on the basis of this hypothesis as it is on the basis of that
advanced by Wirscut. A corollary of WresNER’s theory, which at the same time is one
of its central supports, is the belief that oestrin cannot act on imperfectly differentiated
structures derived from the Miillerian ducts. This belief is, however, contrary to the
facts presented in this paper,* unless one assumes that the hydatids of Morgagni are
fully differentiated structures.

Oestrone stimulates both fibro-muscular and epithelial growth in the hydatids.
The response of the fibro-muscular tissue can be regarded as part of a general sensi-
tivity to oestrogenic substances of mesodermal structures derived from the urogenital
ridge and genital cord. Such a view makes it possible to relate the fact that the fibro-
muscular tissue of apparently the entire genital tract is responsive to oestrone (ZUCKER-
MAN 1936c). Similarly, the proliferation of the epithelium of the hydatid can be
related to the growth which occurs under similar conditions in the uterus masculinus.
This response was first demonstrated in monkeys (PARKES and ZUCKERMAN 1935;
Courrier and Gros 1935; VAN WAGENEN 1935), but,it has since been shown to occur in
the dog (pE Joncu and Kok 1935), and in the guinea-pig (VAN DER WOERD 1936;
