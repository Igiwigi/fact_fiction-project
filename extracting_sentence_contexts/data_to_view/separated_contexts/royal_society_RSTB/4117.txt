bilis, and, in fact, in all the species described by Narnorst, the middle line of the
sporophylls is somewhat thickened, and the synangia arise from this enlarged portion. In the present genus, however, this enlargement seems to have assumed gigantic
proportions, and the sporophylls are thereby converted from tangentially flattened
almost to radially flattened structures. The different types of synangia, as seen in cross-section, are shown in text-fig.
