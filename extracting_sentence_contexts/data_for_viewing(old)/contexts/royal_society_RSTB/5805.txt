the river bed that alterations of river level are transmitted to it very rapidly (see Sept.-
Oct., 1923, -24, and -26 in figs. 15, 16, and 18, pp. 351-353, etc.) yet it does not behave
as a true free-water-table should do, in a“ sakia ” forexample. Frrrar and AUDEBEAU
have shown that the wave coming from the river bed through the sakia gravels cuts the
steadily falling curve from last year’s wave quite suddenly, and that although the
pressure changes can be transmitted rapidly, the movement of the bulk of water occurs

later than one might expect, so that the rise of a sakia pit on the Pyramids Road at
4 km. from the river is shown by Ferrar to take place fully two months after the river
rise. This figure has to be reconciled with the fact that the wave affects similar pits
in the lower Delta equally soon, at distances much greater ; this can be done by remem-
bering that the water leaving the river flows down the valley (which slopes 1 m. in
13 km.) as well as falling outward, so that the water reaching a well situated 4 km. from
the river may have traversed 40 km. underground from upstream. The water-paths
would look like feathers if mapped.

Contrary to our original impression, however, there is little sign of this in Pit ITT.
The river levels at Giza are within the “ pond ” of water held up by the Delta Barrage,
and indicated by the readings of Roda Gauge, opposite Giza village. The pond extends
about 40 km. further upstream, above which the true river levels are recorded on El
Leisi gauge, and we are unable to find any movements of Pit III which conform to the
latter rather than the former with certainty; the nearest indication is in January,
