The lower nut F which rests on the carriage
is split and threaded with a deep thread so that by screwing the two parts L and F hard
together a great pressure can be brought to act on the flanged upper portion of the
specimen. The large distortions so produced in the material of the conical flange harden
copper, iron and aluminium to such an extent that when the tube is afterwards stretched

no observable plastic flow takes place in the material of the flange. The stretching in
fact, begins at the corner D where the flange connects with the parallel part of the tube. The ring R is merely used for holding the two portions of the split nut F in place. Tt will be noticed that in this description the sleeve C plays no part, it might, in fact,
be part of F, when the apparatus is used in the manner described.
