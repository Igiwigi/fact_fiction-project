It has already been stated that the stones of the © Head” are generally angular or
subangular ; occasionally, however, some occur that are much rounded. They yary in
8ize, from blocks upwards of a foot in mean diameter to pieces not larger than hazel-
nuts. On Bovey Heathfield they are fragments of granite, metamorphic rock, car-
bonaceous grit, and trap, with a very few of flint and chert. The two last increase in
number eastward—that is, with increased proximity to the Cretaceous district—and in
some localities are even more abundant than other detritus.

In no instance have I found or heard of limestone-fragments on the Boyey Heath-
field. A transporting current from the north or north-north-east seems to be required to
meet the facts of the case. Were it not for the samples of flint and chert, a moyement
from the west or north-west, or eyen south-west, might have supplied the materials.
No agent progressing from any part of the compass between the north-east and 80uth-
west, through south, could haye furnished the granite-blocks or failed to transport large
quantities of limestone-debris. On the whole I incline to a transportation from a
