the notochord in the region of the dise occurs at the onset of ossification (commencement
of the definitiver Zustand), and this he does not attempt to explain. Merely must I
emphasize, in parenthesis, the enormous difference met with in the mouse, where at
the onset of ossification the intervertebral diameter of the notochordal mass has increased
from 0-05 mm. to at least 0-40 mm., while at the same time the centrum mass has long
been devoid of notochordal tissue, excepting the sheath. The persistence of the noto-
chord in the posterior occipital region, where it forms the basis of the lig. apicis dentis,
is an important fact which I have not encountered in the literature. Nucleus Pulposus.â€”The early work bearing upon the origin of the nucleus pulposus
is considerable, but also confusing. The evidence brought to light was most unsatis-
