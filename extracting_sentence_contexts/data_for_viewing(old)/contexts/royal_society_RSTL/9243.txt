Physiologists are undecided as to the extent in which many apparently automatic actions
may not really be actions of a reflex nature. Given, for instance, any ganglio-muscular
tisxue which is rhythmically contracting, and how are we to know whether the action

X of the ganglia is truly automatic, or sustained from time to time by stimuli proceeding
a from other parts of the organism ? In most cases experiments cannot be conducted with
S reference to this question, but in the case of the Meduse they may be 80; and it was
with the view of throwing light on this question that the experiments just described
= were made. Noy in these experiments the fact is sufficiently obvious that mutilations
= of any part of the organism modify the rhythm of the marginal ganglia most profoundly.
S That this modification does not proceed from shock, would seem to be indicated
g by the facts that the first effect of the mutilation is to quicken the rhythm, that
s there is a sort of general proportion to be observed between the amount of tissue
2 abstracted and the degree of slowing of the rhythm produced, and that the slowing effects
= continue for 80 long a time. All these facts seem to show that we haye here something
'3 other than mere shock to deal with. A strong suspicion, therefore, arises that the cause
<4 of the slowing of the rhythm which results from removing the polypite, or a part of the
> general contractile tissue of the bell, consists in the destruction of some influence of an
= afferent character which had preyiously emanated from the parts of the organizm which
& have been removed; and that the normal rhythm before the operation was partly due
<= to a continuous reception, on the part of the ganglia, of this afferent or stimulating
S influence. In support of this view are the facts that the first effect of 8uch an operation
â€” as we are considering is greatly to accelerate the rhythm, and that this acceleration then
V gradually declines through a period of about a quarter of an hour, 'These facts tend to
