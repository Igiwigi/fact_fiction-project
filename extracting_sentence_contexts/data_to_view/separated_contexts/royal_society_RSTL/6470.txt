The outer part of the jar-

composition, though in this case the green light is 8ensibly instantageous,—July 1862,

of the spark, which, though necessary to start it, was formed at its expense; and as in
the arc discharge the jar was idle, the increase of resistance in a circuit already com-
prising the secondary coil was unimportant. The fact that the blue negative light which appears when the arc discharge is formed
shows air-lines, points to the air as the seat of the intense action which there takes
place; and the very high refrangibility of some of the rays emitted, and the copiousness
of those rays, indicate how intense that action is. The heating of the negative electrode
s8eems to be a secondary effect, not due to the direct passage of the electricity through
the metal (for the section through which it passes is not by any means small), but to
the heat communicated from the film of air investing it. Small as is the mass of the
film compared with that of the portion of the electrode adjacent to it, the rate at which
heat is communicated is enormous.
