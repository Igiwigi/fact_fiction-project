One may, for example,


take y = ya Tj yj, where each y; is an arc from some base point b to z;. These (time-dependent)
arcs can be chosen so that they, under a small time interval under consideration, do not intersect
the homology basis {az, Bx}. Using y the periods of «dG® can be exhibited more clearly as

f *dG® =| dua, (8.3)
OK Y

and
} *dG® = | dUug,- (8.4)
Br y

Relations (8.3) and (8.4) generalize the corresponding vortex pair equations (3.14) and (3.15), in
fact they can be obtained by taking linear combinations of relations of the latter form. The differentials dUy, and dUg, are fixed (independent of z1,...,Zn), so all dependence on
vortex locations now lies in the 1-chain y:

¥ =Y(1,-+-/2n)-

Further on, we may use (8.2) to express (8.3) and (8.4) in terms of the integrals dUg,, dUg, as in
(3.10) and (3.11):

n
} *dG? =| Ua, = >> HU ay (2,0) (8.5)
OK Y j=l
and
n
} *dG? =| dUg, = >> Up, (eb). (8.6)
Bx y i
j=l

Here b may be taken to be the base point mentioned above (after (8.2)), but actually the right
members in (8.5) and (8.6) do not depend on b. The functions Ug,, Ug, have unlimited harmonic
continuations all over M, then become additively multivalued, but the assumption )> j=0
guarantees that whatever branch one chooses on supp y, the final result in the right members
above will always be the same.
