governing the kinetic friction. Many complications can arise during motion on account
of the complex and varying nature of the surfaces in contact. The local pressure will
be continually changing as the surface asperities approach and recede from one
another. If the pressure becomes too great the oil film may be broken down, followed
by seizure between the surfaces. An important factor which has been overlooked in
the past is the surface temperature of the sliding solids. Using the thermoelectric
method Bowden and Ridler (1936) showed that even in the presence of lubricants
the surface temperature may be very high (500° C or more). This will cause volatiliza-
tion and decomposition of most lubricants and is an important cause of the breakdown
of the lubricant film. If either the load or the speed is too great, a welding together of
the “hot spots” on a large scale may occur with consequent damage or seizure of the
surfaces. The fact that an electromotive force is developed shows that some metal to
metal contact is occurring through the lubricant film. This is in harmony with some
earlier work (Beare and Bowden 1935) which showed that the boundary film of
lubricant was unable to afford complete protection to the sliding surfaces. Some wear
and abrasion of the surfaces always occurred. Corrosion and wear through a lubricant
film has also been reported recently by Tomlinson, Thorpe and Gough (1939).

The experiments described in this paper have an important bearing on the theory
of boundary lubrication. The earlier theories all assumed that the sliding between
two lubricated bodies was always continuous. It is clear, however, that this is not the
case; with many lubricants sliding is discontinuous and motion proceeds by a process
of stick and slip. The earlier theories, and in particular that put forward by Hardy,
also suggested that the surfaces were completely separated by the unimolecular films
