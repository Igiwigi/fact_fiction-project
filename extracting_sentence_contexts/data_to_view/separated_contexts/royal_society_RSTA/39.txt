When the magnetic stress reaches
1°800 the friction increases in greater proportion than the stress, until the latter ex-
ceeds 12°935, when the ratio B: A begins to decline. * This is what might be expected
from the behaviour of the magnetic permeability as the stress is gradually increased :
in fact, with this particular specimen of iron, the permeability was found to increase
very rapidly as the magnetic stress rose from 3 to 5 C.G.S. units, and again fell very
rapidly when the stress rose from 12 upwards. The damping effect of magnetic stress, when applied as above, is noteworthy for its
magnitude ; for the logarithmic decrement when the wire is subjected to reversals of
a magnetic stress of 28°540 is actually between twenty and thirty times as great as
when the wire is free from stress or under the influence of a sustained magnetising
stress.t

Experiment X.

In this experiment the effects of reversals and of applying and removing the mag-
netic stress always in the same direction were compared together, the magnetic stress
being in each case 42°775 C.G.S. units, and the vibration-period of the wire 4°725
seconds. In both cases the circuit was broken instantly after it was closed, and the
reversals or closings were made to synchronise with the vibrations of the wire.
