occurs during the period of diminished excitability consequent on previous make,
and that ascending series, indicate that each make excitation occurs during increased
excitability consequent on previous make,


OF THE GALVANIC CURRENT ON THE MOTOR NERVES OF MAN. 975

We also observe that at the termination of an ascending &eries a weaker current,
than the original current will cause a greater contraction than at first ; that at the

termination of a descending series a stronger current than the original current will

cause a smaller contraction than at first. These facts indicate in the former case
diminution of increased excitability, in the latter case a snmmation of diminished
excitability which however very rapidly gives way to increase.

We notice that, eateris paribus, ascending series are most frequently observed at
the beginning of experiments (independently of any increase of current strength), that
descending are mosb frequently observed after the nerve has been for ome time 8ub-
