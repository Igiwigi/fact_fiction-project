On the
other hand, the phenomenon of animal development is generally known to be a highly robust
system. For example, hydra and planaria can regenerate a whole body from a small part, and
partial regeneration is universally observed in other higher organisms. This fact suggests that
an autonomous system, such as Turing’s mechanism, must intervene. The most direct way to
prove the existence of Turing’s principle is to apply perturbations to a spatial pattern of living
things and observe their dynamic reproduction process. The skin patterns of animals, as well as
those of fish and amphibians, are most suitable for this purpose.
