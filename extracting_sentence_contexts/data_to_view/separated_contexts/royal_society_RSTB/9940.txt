Figure 3. (a—d) Estimates of mean annual temperature (°C) over time in the Turkana Basin using two different levels of aggregation (right—left) and two different
models based on the dental ecometrics HYP and LOP (up—down). 95% CI for the fit are shown in orange; please note that a narrow interval does not imply
confidence in the estimated value itself, only in the consistent performance of the model.
