Fortunately, the mechanical part of the problem admitted extreme mass scaling of
using 10000-fold density (even 100 000-fold with a minor error), which increased the critical time
step to 100-fold allowing practically convenient solution times. It is the relatively low loading rate
nature of the thermal loading that renders the mechanical part amenable to mass scaling. The 3D simulations of the thermal jet drilling corroborated the already experimentally
established fact that this method is a viable one with granite rock. Rock heterogeneity has a
significant effect in facilitating the underlying thermal spallation phenomenon. More precisely, a
test simulation using a heat flux, modelling a thermal jet with 10 mm of radius, with an intensity
of 3 MWm~ and a duration of 0.1s, followed by 0.1s natural cooling phase, showed that
the significant rate of penetration, approximately 300mm min~!, can be theoretically achieved.
