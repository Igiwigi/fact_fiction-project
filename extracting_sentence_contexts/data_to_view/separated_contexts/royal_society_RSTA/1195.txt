However, there is significant variation between the
different studies (figure 2) and a consensus on tropospheric abundance has not yet been achieved. The least controversial aspect of Neptune’s CO profile is that there is a significant amount,
approximately 1-2 ppm, in the stratosphere at millibar pressures. The fact that the stratospheric
abundance is greater than the tropospheric abundance implies that Neptune’s stratospheric CO
must have an external origin [79]. Neptune’s stratospheric H2O abundance of approximately
1.5-3.5 ppb (parts per billion) [81] must also have an external origin as water condenses deep
in Neptune’s interior at approximately 100-1000 bar, depending on the deep temperature profile.
