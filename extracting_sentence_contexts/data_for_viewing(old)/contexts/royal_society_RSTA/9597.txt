plate. When we have fixed this length, we have settled the Rreynotps’ number of
the motion investigated ; and although (for convenience) we have adopted a definite
value for v, it is known from the theory of dynamical similarity that our solution will
apply to any values of U, Land y which satisfy the relation (34). The occurrence of
U? in (32) is a matter of no consequence, since the absolute magnitude of 4, is deter-
mined solely by the boundary condition (31), and the absolute magnitude of is not
restricted by (33).

11. The procedure indicated in the last paragraph is in fact equivalent to a change
of variables, from «, 8 to «/2v, 8/2v. It permits the introduction of a standard solution
of equation (33), which solution is also the basis of Lams’s treatment of the OsEEN
equation.* This may be written in the form

1 =e" Ky (7),

where r stands for »/a? + 8%, and K, (r) is the Bussnx’s function of imaginary argument,
of the “ second kind,” which has been tabulated.t It represents the solution of (33)
appropriate to a point source of vorticity situated at the point (« = 0, @ = 0), which
point (so far as the solution (35) is concerned) may be anywhere on the « - 8 net.

We use this solution to deduce a second solution t,, appropriate to a “ doublet of
