ON THE EARLY STAGES OF INFLAMMATION. I thus became for the first time aware that the pigment is capable of variations, and
my attention having been directed to the s8nbject, I 800n found that similar <<
occur spontaneously, and give rise to alterations in the colour of the skin, which is paler
in proportion as the colouring matter is more completely collected into round spots. For some weeks I supposed myself to have been the first discoverer of this curious fact,
till I was referred by Dr. SHARPEY to the recent labours of the Germans on the 81hject, They, however, as I afterwards found, had taken an entirely erroneous view of the
phenomenon, attributing the round form of the masses of pigment to contraction of the
branching offsets of stellate cells ; whereas it turned out that the chromatophorous cells
do not alter in form, but that the colourless fluid and dark molecules which constitute
their contents are capable of remarkable variations in relative distribution, the mole-
cules being sometimes all congregated in the central parts of the cells, the offiets con-
taining merely invisible fluid, while at other times the colouring particles are diffuged
throughout their complicated and delicate branches; and between these extremes any
intermediate condition may be assumed. It further appeared that concentration of Pig-
ment takes place in obedience to neryous influence, while diffusion, though also an
active vital process, tends to occur when the pigment-cells are liberated from the action
of the nerves.
