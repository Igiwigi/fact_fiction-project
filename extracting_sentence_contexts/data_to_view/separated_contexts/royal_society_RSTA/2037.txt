before the first
indications of the outermost band appear. In the development of the region lying
between the minimum of ionisation (at 4°8 cm.) and the embryonic ring two distinct
shells may be detected. These facts of observation show that the uranium halo develops very much as if
the inverse square law did not operate at all or acted but partially, and it‘is evident
that the final state of a halo according to fig. 1 is quite in accordance with the
photographs referred to above. In a word, the development of the halo, as observed,
indicates that for some reason the divergence of the rays which should lead to the
obliteration of the features of the ionisation curve of fig.
