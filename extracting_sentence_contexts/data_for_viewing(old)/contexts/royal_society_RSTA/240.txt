the unstable solutions look like the unstable solutions in figure 4d but upside-
down, and now the maxima increase as h* approaches h~. On the other hand,
one may find that the stable stop-and-go solution for h~ < h* < h* almost does
not change in state space compared with figure 4e,f, but the lengths of low- and
high-velocity plateaux change compared with figure 4d according to

(Here Tjam is measured at vp = VUmax/3.) In other words, h* and h7 are
independent of the equilibrium density h*, and, in fact, the fold bifurcations
happen in figure 4b when the low- and high-velocity plateaux disappear at h* ~ h*
and h* * h-, respectively.

Introduction. Traffic jams 4473

To approximate the flow along the oscillatory branch, we averaged the
Lagrangian flux q, = PnUn for one period and plotted the average (q) as a function
of equilibrium density p* in figure 4c. For equilibria, (q) = q*, while, for the
stop-and-go oscillations, one may use equation (6.7) and obtain
