and the height is
H+H+Pcse+Qsine+S8T Seay Sa io SEE GTA: One part of M, N, P, Q arises from a true change in the tide when the longitude
of the moon’s node changes, and the remainder (nearly equally large) merely depends
on the reference to true instead of fictitious transit. The quantities t and } depend
partly on a portion of the equation of time and partly on the annual tide. We must now explain the computation of 2 dJ/dT and of 2 dh/dT.

Tf vy Uys +++ Ugg are cyclical values of a function, the symmetrical interpolation
formula in the neighbourhood of 1, is

In the present case the first term will usually suffice, but the second term may be
easily computed.
