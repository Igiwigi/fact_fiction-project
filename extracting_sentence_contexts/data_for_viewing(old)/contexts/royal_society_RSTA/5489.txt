n 2005, 50% of the world’s population lived in cities consuming over 75% of the
world’s energy use; as human development (as measured by the UN index)
energy use will increase faster than the increase in population. By 2030, it is
oredicted that over 60% of the world’s population will live in cities with this
ercentage continuing to rise to the end of the century. Urban areas are
yarticularly vulnerable to the effects of global warming, particularly extreme
weather events such as floods, storm surges, drought and heat waves (Stern et al.
2006; IPCC 2007). For example, it is estimated that the 2003 heat wave in
Europe killed as many as 35 000 people. With modern urban lifestyles cities are
consuming ever more power, which is still largely generated by fossil fue
combustion; the main uses are heating or air conditioning homes and buildings
and powering vehicles, with industry in cities now taking a relatively smal
oroportion. In fact cities discharge an amount of heat comparable to tha
received from solar radiation. Inevitably they contribute to greenhouse gas
emissions from fossil fuel combustion and also from waste disposal managemen
oractices. As rapidly growing cities are clearing forests and vegetated areas, they
are reducing the surface absorption of greenhouse gases and thereby further
increasing their concentration in the atmosphere.

Therefore, cities have special responsibilities both to their own citizens anc
o everyone else to mitigate future climate change, at the same time helping
heir communities to adapt to the growing seriousness of the consequences for
oeople’s health and welfare. Since the planning of such policies is complex as
well as politically difficult, decision makers responsible for the future of cities
require the best expert knowledge available. Hence, the importance and
