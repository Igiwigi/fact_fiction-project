4. But though the general course of the curves has this resemblance, the amount
of flexure is not the same at different places. This result had already been obtained
by the comparison of previous obseryations, especially those made at Brest, Ply-
mouth, and London; it is confirmed s0 clearly by the observations here referred to,
that I think it may now be assumed to be a general fact. The inferences from this Å¿act are very important ; for in the first place it puts an
end to all attempts to deduce the mass of the moon from the phenomena of tides, or
to correct the tables of the tides by means of the mass of the moon. The approximate
agreement of the mass of the moon deduced by LarLace from the tides of Brest, with
the mass obtained from other phenomena, cannot be considered as otherwise than
accidental.
