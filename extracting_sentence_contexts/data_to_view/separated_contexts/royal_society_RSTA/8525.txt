As a matter of fact the sound was louder in the A than in the B
experiment. It may also be noted that in both cases the sound was louder than in
the Wheatstone’s Bridge experiment. To sum it up, it may be said that the available evidence points to the fact that, when
the microphone is employed with an amplifier‘and vibration galvanometer and only very
faint sounds are observed, the deflection shown by the galvanometer is approximately
proportional to the amplitude of the sound.

§8. The Effect of Tilting the Microphone. It has already been mentioned that, when taking sound measurements with a Hot-
Wire Microphone, it is necessary to keep the axis of the microphone inclined at some
fixed angle to the horizontal.
