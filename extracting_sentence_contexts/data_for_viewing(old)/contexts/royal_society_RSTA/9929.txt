It follows at once extremely closely that the laws (D), (F) hold, viz.,
D()=S8() = VP(1),

also (G) is nearly so. We note that Li agrees with the other elements in making
P(o#)# VS(1), and it differs also in the same direction.

The form of VD recalls at once the formula for the F sequences found in Cs and Rb.
In fact, a RypBERG form would well serve it. To test this we can find the differences
in successive wave-numbers. They are entered in the table above with the other
elements, and an inspection leaves no doubt but that here we have the F type. VP is
clearly a D type, although we should have expected the p to be somewhat smaller,
The third series is thus VD(1)—VF(m), and the first VS(1)—VD(m). The usual
D series, however, gives n = VP(1)—VD(m), and we ought to expect to find it.
Now, certain additional lines have been observed by K.H. and §., viz., 6240°3 S.,
46363 S., 41482 8., 3924 K.H. If they are the series in question their wave-
numbers ought to differ by the same amount from those of the corresponding lines in
the old P. The differences are 14904'73+2°8, 14903°93+2, 1491410410, 14905415,
In finding these the means of K.H. and 8. were used, except for the last, which 8.
has not observed, but Exner and HasneK have. The permissible errors have been
taken twice the difference of the readings of each two observers. The difference is
