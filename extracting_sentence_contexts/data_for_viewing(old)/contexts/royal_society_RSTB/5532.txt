in front of the leg. Both these muscles, the transverse and longitudinal, arise from
mesoderm which lies next to that which passes into the leg itself. The remaining
part of the subsomitic mesoderm though originally dorsal to that which gives rise to
the extrinsic muscles of the leg becomes enclosed by the transverse leg muscle and
develops into the ventral longitudinal muscle of the body wall (fig. 19).

The most dorsal and lateral part of the mesoderm, viz., the somite, occupies, as we have
already seen, the hollow formed by the inturning of the body wall. Though the cells
forming its walls are arranged radially when seen in transverse section there is not
always a sharp line of demarcation between its ventral components and the subsomitic
mesoderm already mentioned. As development proceeds it becomes more difficult to
determine where somitic and subsomitic mesoderm meet. This difficulty arises chiefly
from the fact that the ventral wall of the somite forms a flowing mass of irregularly
shaped cells which soon lose to a certain extent their power to take up stain. These
cells are the primordia of the fat body and spread in a ventro-median direction over
the developing leg muscles whose development we have just considered (fig. 20). The
fat cells soon become vacuolated and separated into two masses, one of which lies against
the nerve cord, the other remaining in closer contact to the somitic mesoderm, so
forming the primordia of the ventral and dorsal fat-bodies respectively (fig. 17).

With the formation of the fat body from the ventral wall of the somite the cavity of
the latter disappears or becomes continuous with the epineural sinus. The inner dorsal
and outer walls of the somite are now left intact forming a kind of inverted blunt wedge
(fig. 17). The outer layer of the somite becomes differentiated into dorso-lateral and
dorso-longitudinal muscles of the body wall (fig. 21). â€˜Their development is similar to
