‘Ad. 43, have also carbon balance sheets of different types, since, while Ad. 43 gives a
very large figure for “ carbon unaccounted for,” Ad, 41 produces only negligible amounts
of products of this type. In other respects the two carbon balance sheets are not very
dissimilar.

The three species included in subsection IIb, P. rugulosum, Ad. 27, P. purpuro-
genum, Ad. 36, and P. luteum, Ad. 30, also have different types of carbon balance
sheets. Thus, while Ad. 27 and Ad. 30 produce practically no “volatile neutral
compounds” and have respiration coefficients approaching unity, Ad. 36 gives a large .
yield of this type of product and has a very high respiration coefficient.

The carbon balance sheet for P. luteum (non-ascosporic form), Ad. 30, has several
interesting characteristics. Of outstanding interest is the fact that while the titratable
acidity is only 0-6 c.c., the “carbon in non-volatile acids” gives the relatively high
figure of 0-477 gm., corresponding to about 11 per cent. of some compound precipitated
as a calcium salt in 80 per cent. alcohol. The explanation for this will be found in
Part XIII, in which are described the preparation and properties of a mucilaginous
material which is a complex built up of units of a malonyl polyglucose. It titrates
as an acid having a combining weight of between 400 and 500, and is precipitable as
a calcium salt from 80 per cent. alcohol. The same types of figures are also given by
P. rugulosum, Ad. 27, in which the titratable acidity is 1-4 ¢.c. and the “ carbon in
non-volatile acids” 0+359 gm, and by P. tardum, Ad. 45 (see Table XII), in which the
figures are 0-6 c.c. and 0-392 gm. respectively. The nature of the products responsible
for these figures in the case of Ad. 27 and Ad. 45 has not yet been investigated.
