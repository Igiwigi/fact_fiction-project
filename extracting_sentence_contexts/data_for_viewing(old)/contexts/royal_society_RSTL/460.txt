$ubstances, the name of thunderbolt, or thunderstone, has igno-
rantly attached itself to them ; and, because a variety of sub-
stances accidentally present, near buildings and trees struck
with lightning, have, with the same ignorance, been collected as
thunderbolts, the thunderbolt and the fallen metalline substance

- have been ranked in the same class of absurdity. Certainly,

since the phenomena of lightning and electricity have been s0
well identified, the idea of a thunderbolt is ridiculous. But the
existence of peculiar substances fallen on the earth, I cannot
hesitate to assert; and, on the concordance of remote and
authenticated facts, I shall rest the assertion.

Mr. K1nG, the learned author of Remarks concerning Stones said
to have fallen from the Clouds, in these Days, and in ancient Times,
has adduced quotations of the greatest antiquity, descriptive of
the descent of fallen stones ; and, could it be thought necessary
to add antique testimonies to those instanced by s0 profound an
antiquarian, the quotations of Mons. FALcoNErT, in his papers
upon Beetilia, inserted in the Histoire des Inscriptions et Belles-
Lettres;* the quotations in ZauN's Specula Physico-mathematica
Historiana ;+ the Fisica Sotterranea of GiacinTo GEMMa; the
works of PLixy, and others, might be referred to.
