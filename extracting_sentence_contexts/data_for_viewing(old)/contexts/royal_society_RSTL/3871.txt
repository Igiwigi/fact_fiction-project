thirty-eighth (37, 38.) is itself a double ganglion that supplies nerves to the apodal
antepenultimate, penultimate, and anal 8egments.

The brain (b) in this family affords some interesting considerations. The two lobes
are very small, pear-shaped, and developed on their under surface into very long and
slender crura, which join beneath the cesophagus with the great aggregation of gan-
glia. Each of these lobes is rounded on the external side; and the optic nerves and
ganglia are entirely absent, there being externally no organ of vision. On the front
of each lobe there is a small elongated ganglion for the antennal nerve, which passes
directly into each of those organs (a), This is a remarkable condition of the brain
in these Myriapodes, and a similar one has been described by Tzeviranus* in Geo-
philus, although in that genus, as I shall presently show, the optic nerves are not en-
tirely absent, as in the Polydesmide. This fact is especially interesting in reference
to the analogy that is believed to exist between these lobes of the brain and optic
ganglia, and the corpora quadrigemina of Vertebrata, and seems to show that their
office is more important than that of simple ganglia of any individual organ ; and that
the ganglia of the optic nerves themselves are those by which impressions are received
from the retina and transmitted to the middle supra-cesophageal ganglia, the brain,
the common sensorium of the whole nervous system.

The distribution of the ganglia and nerves of the cord deserve particular attention.
On entering the fourth segment the cord is somewhat elongated and passes between
the donble outlets of the female organs, immediately behind which it gives off the
nerves to those organs from the atrophied ganglion. These nerves are exceedingly
large, and ramify extensively over the muscles and distal portions of those retractile
