that the main body of the occipital arch is morphologically posterior to the hypoglossal
root, which becomes enclosed in a foramen by development of cartilage in an anterior
direction.

Median to the occipital arches, and participating in the medio-ventral border of
the above-mentioned foramina, are a pair of plates of thin young cartilage: the paired
posterior rudiments of the parachordals. Their paired nature is of importance, as is
also the fact that they are visibly less well chondrified than the occipital arches, and that
although in contact with the occipital arches in front of and behind the hypoglossal
foramen, they appear to be distinct from those structures. The importance of this
lies in the tendency which is shown by those who advocate an unpaired origin for the
parachordal to regard these paired posterior parachordal rudiments as part and parcel
of the occipital arches.

Stage 3. 15} days, 13-5 mm. g.l.; 7mm. hl. (Figs. 4 and 5.)

There is little differerice as regards the occipital arches and the posterior parachordal
rudiments between this stage and the last. Faint staining, however, now reveals the
presence of rudiments of two fresh structures. A pair of rudiments which occupy the
position of the anterior region of the parachordal has appeared, separate from one another
