In this way, it
is possible to quantify the diversity of the ordering symbols (patterns) derived from a scalar
time series. Note that the appropriate symbol sequence arises naturally from the time series
and no model-based assumptions are needed. In fact, the necessary ‘partitions’ are devised by
comparing the order of neighbouring relative values rather than by apportioning amplitudes
according to different levels. This technique, as opposed to most of those in current practice,
takes into account the temporal structure of the time series generated by the physical process
under study. This feature allows us to uncover important details concerning the ordinal
structure of the time series [26,39,40] and can also yield information about temporal correlation
[16,17].
