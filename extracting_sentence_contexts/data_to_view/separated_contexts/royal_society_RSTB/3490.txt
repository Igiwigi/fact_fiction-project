In other words, so long as the
individual Euglenz are in such a position that they can be acted upon by light, no
streaming takes place. But as soon as they become so congested that a certain
number of them are obscured or placed in the shade by the others, they are no
longer attracted or held up by the light, and a downward streaming at once begins. It appears to be, in fact, a manifestation of precisely the same phenomenon as occurs
in the process of aggregation in closed tubes and cells in the dark. The following experiment illustrates this clearly : A small number of motile cells
in a white saucer is placed in a window. In a short time they will all be attracted
to the light side, and in the form of a distinct green layer at the edge of the water.
