tractable. It is also worth mentioning that a useful computation strategy for the case where
Q=0 is to add a diffusion to the drift equation, which has the effect of allowing the smoother
to downweight distant measurements, and so deconcentrate the likelihood function, perhaps
reducing the number of local maxima. But this paper is not about computational strategies, but
about the fundamental challenges. On this basis, a stochastic model has to be more challenging
than a deterministic model, although, at the same time, some computational approximations will
perform less badly with a stochastic model than with a deterministic one.

4. Uncertain static parameters

We fully expect 0 to be uncertain; worse, it is often ill-defined, except as an instrumental quantity
that we introduce in order to construct a prior distribution over X. This makes it hard to specify
a prior distribution 7 (@), but in fact this is not our main difficulty.
