A very
definite residual retardation is observed, which gradually disappears completely, if
enough time is allowed, at any rate for the range of loading employed which was well
inside the yield point.

(3) This optical creep is comparatively large and may easily amount to 10 per cent.
of the initial value in a few minutes. This percentage, however, diminishes as the load
is decreased. These facts have an important bearing on stress determinations from
observations of artificial double refractions in celluloid.

(4) The stretch of the celluloid follows laws closely similar to those of the optical
retardation, the initial stretch being also approximately proportional to the applied load.

(5) The retardation r and stretch § are connected in each case by a linear relation

r = aT-+ 8,

T being the applied load in each case. The constants a, 6 are found to vary within fairly narrow limits for any given specimen
at a given time. During recovery after unloading,

r = BS
gives a fair fit.
(6) The above linear relation is satisfactorily explained by assuming for the celluloid
a heterogeneous structure, each constituent separately obeying a stress-optical law in
which the retardation is rigorously proportional to the stress.
(7) The strain 8 on loading is connected with the time ¢ by a formula

S = §)-bat's+-bt
and the stress-optical retardation 7 by a similar formula
r = To+pt'*+-¢t.
