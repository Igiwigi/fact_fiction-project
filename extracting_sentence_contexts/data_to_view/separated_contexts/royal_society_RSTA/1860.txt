As would be expected, the amplitudes as determined in this rapid
sweep were generally less than before, and could only be determined roughly. Other experiments which cannot be described here have shown that all responses,
however small or irregular, which occur in an analysis can always be accounted for. In fact, analysis has sometimes indicated the presence in the source of quite unsus-
pected vibrations which have been afterwards shown to exist by other means. Replacing the galvanometer by a telephone, a weak sound of machine-like quality
was heard, the frequency D = 261 being most pronounced, and also a marked throbbing
which was probably associated with the heating of B and C (89 and 100). (4) Analysis as affected by a General Background of Sound—The object of these
experiments was to determine to what extent a definite vibration could be masked by
the presence of a general “ background” of sound.
