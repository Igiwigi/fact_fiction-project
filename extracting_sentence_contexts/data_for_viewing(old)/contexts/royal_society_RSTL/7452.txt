Z extent of tissne trayersed by it is greater, and since the relative common sensitiveness of
Za surface varies with the number of distinct sentient elements it contains, it follows
S that the greater length of the cones and rods, and their greater slenderness, which allows
Va larger number of them to the superficial unit, are in harmony with the greater sensi-
zÂ»tiveness of the retina at the macula lutea. Inasmuch, however, as the foveal cones are
== 8touter than the rods, a superficial unit at the centre of the foyea contains fewer sentient
AG e. percipient) elements than the same unit near the periphery of the macula lutea ; and
on this ground the sensitiveness of the retina at the fovea should be less than that of the
-2 retina near the periphery of the macula. On the other hand, the extreme thinness of
3 the inner layers of the retina at the centre of the foyea, places the bacillary layer here
Smost favourably for receiving incident light.
S 2. The division of the rods and cones into an outer and an inner segment is natural.
&The facts in support of this are, the presence of the division in perfectly fresh specimens ;
=its sharpness and constant occurrence at a definite place; the constantly rectilinear
& figure of the outer, and the curvilinear figure of the inner segment ; the different refrac-
= tive powers of the segments; and their different behaviour towards staining and chemical
Z s0lutions.
E 3. From these structural differences it is a fair inference that the segments have dif-
S ferent physiological meanings.

The higher refractive power, straight sides, and slender cylindrical or prismatic figure
of the outer segment may be adaptations for confining within the segment light incident
upon its end, and for preventing the lateral escape of light through the sides of the
segment into neighbouring cones and rods. 'These considerations incline me to adopt
the opinion that this segment has an optical function, an opinion which derives further
