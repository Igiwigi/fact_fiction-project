Soufriére Hills and South Soufriére Hill as made up of several little-trenched volcanic
cones of similar nature; they consist of two very considerably trenched volcanoes of
different ages and of different structure. This difference of structure accounts for the
steep south-easterly slopes of South Soufriére Hill (p. 15); Davis regarded the steep
slope as due to a great landslip. He correctly deduced the relative ages of Silver Hill,
the Centre Hills and the Soufriére Hills, from differences in the maturity of their
erosion. With regard to the Soufriére Hills he appears to have been lucky, for it is
clear from his account, and from the titles of his illustrations, that he took Chance’s
Mountain, and the spur to the north of it, to be distinct and little-trenched volcanic
cones; they aré parts of the same volcano separated by a deep gorge (p. 28). It is
beyond the scope of the present paper to discuss Davis’s ingenious explanation of the
truncated spurs of the islands of the Lesser Antilles in terms of coral reefs and glacial
control. As regards Montserrat, the facts can be explained more simply (p. 19).

Mr F. A. Perret, the well-known American volcanologist, visited the island several
times during the earthquake period of 1934—5, and submitted to the Governor of the
Leeward Islands a number of valuable reports on the earthquake and soufriére
activity; these were published by the Colonial Office. Mr Perretis at present engaged
in preparing for publication a scientific account of his work in Montserrat.

Mr C. A. Gomez, until lately Curator of the Botanical Station in Montserrat,
placed at my disposal a detailed and up-to-date history of the local earthquake and
soufriére activity, which he had prepared officially for the Government. This account
was of the greatest value to the expedition.
