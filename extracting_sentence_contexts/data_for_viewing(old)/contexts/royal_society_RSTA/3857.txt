In general, one major concern for an FSO system is its link reliability and robustness stemming
from harsh time-varying channel conditions, such as fog, rain and atmospheric turbulence [27,28].
In addition to power loss, these channel conditions may distort the transmitted beam, resulting in
significant system performance degradations and even link outage. Moreover, these effects may
fluctuate over time with wide dynamic ranges in magnitude [29].

Among these conditions, atmospheric turbulence is generally considered a major factor that
limits the system performance [29,30]. It is known that inhomogeneity in the temperature
and pressure of the atmosphere lead to random variations in the refractive index along the
transmission path, and can easily distort the phase front of a light beam [28]. For FSO links
using phase-front-sensitive OAM beams, the effects of atmospheric turbulence become more
challenging due to the fact that the proper demultiplexing of the received OAM beams depends
on their helical phase-front structures [31,32]. Atmospheric turbulence may lead to fluctuations in
the power of received OAM channels and inter-modal crosstalk between channels with different
OAM values [33]. Under a dynamic turbulent atmosphere, these degradations are slowly time-
varying processes with a time scale of the order of milliseconds (generally much longer than the
signalling period) [28,34].

(b) Orbital angular momentum-multiplexed radio-frequency communications

LOS RF communications with fixed transmitter and receiver locations is of increasing importance
due to its potential in many applications [35,36]. Conventional LOS RF links can use the
well-established multiple-input multiple-output technique with multiple spatially separated
