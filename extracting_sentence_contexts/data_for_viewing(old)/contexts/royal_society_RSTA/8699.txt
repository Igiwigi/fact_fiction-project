complex, the equation

will not usually give a real value for @: and so there is usually no direction in which
the scattered wave is zero* (or of order («a)").

It may be of interest to note here that experimental work on the scattering
of light by fine particles has been carried out with silver particles suspended in
water.} The corresponding values of ca seem to vary from } to 2, and the value of
/K is taken as 0'2—: (3°6); thus the approximations in (ii.) are not sufficient to
calculate either 8, (xv) or S,(c@) with any accuracy.t In actual fact it proved
necessary to use Lord Rayiercu’s exact formule, equivalent to (4°7) above, and to
go as far as n = 4 in the series.§

§6. Case or Larce Perrecriy Conpuctine SPHERES.

Before proceeding to the final formule, it will be convenient to state certain results
given by Macponaxp|| for the values of the functions §, (z), E,(z), when both » and
z are large.

* For the case in which K —1 is small this conclusion is given by G. W. WALKER, ‘Quarterly Journal
of Mathematics,’ vol. 30, 1899, p. 217. The formule given on that page agree with (5-6), when K — 1 is
small; but the more general formule on the preceding page do not agree with (5-6) completely. I have
