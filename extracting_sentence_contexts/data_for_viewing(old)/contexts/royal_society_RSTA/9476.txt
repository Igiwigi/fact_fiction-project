The basis on which the curves were treated was largely determined by the fact
that the D, H and V curves had to be considered at different times. If a careful
consideration of the curves from all three elements had preceded all measurements,
a common selection of ordinary days would probably have been made. As it is,
a little more disturbance enters into the ordinary day H inequality than into that
for V, and a little more into the D inequality than into that for H. This is most to be
regretted perhaps in relation to the derived inequalities. The north component (N)
and west component (W) inequalities depend on both D and H, while the total force
(T) and inclination (I) inequalities depend on H and V. ‘These inequalities, not
