There is very obviously a struggle for the available material. As in the Perophoridae, the constituent zooids of a colony are united together by
the blood vessels of the test and have a circulation in common. In fact, the colony

Pizon (1893), in later years of pz Srtys-LonccHamps, and the recent series by
Brien (1930).
