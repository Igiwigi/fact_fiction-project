Among the water-worn masses of bone 80 abundantly strewn along those parts of the southern shores of
the Isle of Wight, which are bounded by cliffs of the Wealden strata, I had often met with specimens in
which the body of a very large vertebra is anchylosed to one 0 disproportionately small, that I could not ex-
plain their origin, until Professor Owux's description of the structure of the sacrum suggested their true nature. These foxsils are in fact one of the large vertebrz either of the anterior or posterior end of the sacrum united to
one of the slender middle vertebrae. A specimen of this kind in the highly interesting collection of Mr. Bans,
is of enormous size ; the anterior face of the largest vertebra being 74 inches by 64 in diameter. This fossil is
also interesting on another account, for on one side of the body of the largest vertebra there is an abnormal
enlargement (or exostosis) : I have observed similar bony tumours on the sides of the bodies of other vertebre.
