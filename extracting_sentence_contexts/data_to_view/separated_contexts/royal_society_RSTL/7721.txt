The equation is
4AXZW(3Y +X+Z+W)+Y0X*+Z22 + W?--2XZ—2XW —2ZW)=0. 'The complete intersection with the cubic surface is made up of the lines (Y=0, X=0),
(Y=0, Z=0), (Y=0, W=0) (the axes) each twice, and of a sextic curye which is the
spinode curve; o'=6. The spinode curye is a complete intersection 2X 3; the equations may in fact be

written
Y*+Y? (X+Z+W)+4aXZW =0,
3Y?+4Y(X+2+W)+4(XZ+XW+Z2W)=0;
the nodes D, C, A are nodes (double points) of the curye, the tangents at each node
being the nodal rays. Each of the transversals is a single tangent of the spinode curve; in fact for the
transversal YZ +X=0, W=0, these equations of course satisfy the equation of the
cubic surface ; and substituting in the equation of the Hessian, we have Y(X—ZY=0.
