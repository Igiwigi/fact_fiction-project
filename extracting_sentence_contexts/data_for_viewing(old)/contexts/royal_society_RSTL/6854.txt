found the above observation confirmed (the conducting-power of cadmium being at 0*
23-725). Thallium, therefore, appears to belong to that class of metals* which, when
alloyed with lead, tin, cadmium, or zinc, or with one another, do not conduct electricity
in the ratio of their relative volumes, but always in a lower degree than the mean of their
volumes, and not to that class of metals to which lead belongs, namely, those which when
alloyed with one another conduct electricity in the ratio of their relative volumes.
Respecting the conducting-power of the alloys of thallium, we shall discuss them in
our paper © On the Influence of Temperature on the Electric Conducting-Power of

=y Alloys,” which will shortly be ready for publication.

We are greatly indebted to the kindness of Professor PpRcy, who placed at our disposal
the specimens of iron used for the following experiments; in fact, with the exception of |
the two last, they are all from his collection. As several of them have been analysed by |
Mr. Tookzy in his laboratory, the results we have obtained will be the more interesting, |
as they show how traces of foreign matter influence the conducting-power of iron,

We will first give the numerical results, and then make some remarks on them,

1. Flectrotype Iron, deposited from a solution of pure sulphate of iron. The strips
were very thin and porous; we could not, therefore, obtain concordant values for the con-
ducting-power, but were able to determine the percentage decrement in the conducting-
power between 0 and 100%, We have, therefore taken the firs observed conducting-

Power equal 100.
