Before 1 conclude, it may not be improper to
obſerve, that ſome time ago I was fortunate enough to
cure a boy who had long had the St. Vitus's dance
(though in a much leſs degree) by electricity. A violent
convulſive diſeaſe, omewhat fimilarto the above, though,
if I recollect right, not attended with the aphonza, was
ſucceſsfully treated in the ſarge way by Dr: WATSON, and
is recorded in the Philoſophical Tranſactions. May we
not then conclude, that theſe faCts alone, and more might
perhaps be produced, are ſufficient to intitle eledricity
to a diſtinguiſhed place in the claſs of antiſpaſmodics?
