age at last birth

women (same sample as in figure 2): (a) Kaplan-Meier survival curves for
age at last birth (dashed line) and age at menopause (solid line), (b) histo-
gram of number of years between last birth and menopause (mean: 11.2,
median: 11, range: 0-33, s.d.: 6.05) and (c) boxplots of age at last birth
on the x-axis according to age at menopause (divided into five 3-year age
groupings) on the y-axis. (See figure 2 legend for explanation of boxplot fea-

Both number of live births and number of stillbirths are quite heterogeneous, with more fecund women reproducing
