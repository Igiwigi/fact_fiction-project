In a similar way, Escherichia coli pro-
gresses by an alternation between rapid propulsion to a new position, followed
by a pause during which it decides to set off in a new direction, creating paths
that are remarkably similar to those traced about by the human eye in visual
scanning (figure 1): both are foraging—E. coli for nourishment, our eyes for
information. And like our eyes, our hands perpetually alternate between
reaching and grasping [3]. The fact that the motor system is as much concerned with not moving as
with moving has always been something of an elephant in the room. As
Sherrington wrote in 1915: ‘The role of muscle as an executant of movements
is so striking that its office in preventing movement and displacement is
somewhat overlooked’ [4]. Furthermore, we shall see that the maintenance of
stillness is not simply a matter of doing nothing: it requires as much if not
more active and accurate control as creating the movements themselves.
