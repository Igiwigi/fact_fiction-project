There is also growing interest in exploring VR dynamics in FFNs. For example, Qin ef al.
investigated the VR phenomenon in multi-layer FFN constituted with FHN neurons [83]. Considering the fact that all neurons in a population cannot receive exactly the same HF input,
they applied HF driving to the neurons with different amplitudes and phases. It was found
that heterogeneous HF stimuli may be a more useful driving strategy in weak signal detection
and transmission through layers. More precisely, distributed amplitudes of HF signal within the
population result in energetically efficient successful communication between neuronal layers
due to enabling correlated firing activity of interacting neurons.
