As always in MFQM, a system has a state, even if we do not know what that state is. And, as
always in MFQM, statistics means ensembles of identically prepared systems:

If, for many systems Si,. . Su (replicas of S), these measurements give the results
mentioned, then this ensemble [S/,. : Sl coincides in all its statistical properties with
the mixture that corresponds to the results of the measurements.

Changes in statistical properties mean the creation of new ensembles with different population
demographics:

That the results of the measurements are the same for all Si, Si can be attributed,
by M., to the fact that originally a large ensemble [S1,...,SN] was given in which the


measurements were carried out, and then those elements for which the desired results
occurred were collected into a new ensemble. This is then [S4,..., Siy].

Here, M. refers to the measurement postulate, ‘If the physical quantity % is measured twice in
succession in a system S, then we get the same value each time’ (p. 335).

So, we have something like the updating of probabilities by the Bayes rule. However, von
Neumann phrases the scenario in completely kollectivist language. Merely invoking Bayes’
theorem does not make one a Bayesian. For example, von Mises makes use of Bayes’ theorem,
calling it ‘a proposition applying to an infinite number of experiments’, or, in other words, to
