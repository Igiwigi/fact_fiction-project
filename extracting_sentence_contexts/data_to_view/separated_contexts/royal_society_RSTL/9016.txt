In this instance the polypite continued to respond to stimuli applied at the tentacle
marked A after the line of junction-tissue marked ab had been reduced to the thick-
ness of one fortieth of an inch.

(F) Stimulation of the Convex Surface of the Nectocalyz of Sarsia.â€”I have this year

tried the effects of stimulating the conyex, or external, surface of Sarsia, in consequence
of its having been suggested to me that, as this is the surface which is naturally the
most liable to come in contact with foreign bodies during the natural swimming-
motions of the animal, it is to be expected that this part of the animal should receive
a nerve-supply from the marginal ganglia. But although this is what we might
reasonably expect to be the case, as a matter of fact it is not 80. Even strong
faradaic stimulation applied to any part of the external surface of the nectocalyx fails
to produce the slightest response, provided the current employed is not s0 strong as to
cause escape into the internal surface. That the responses are due to snch an escape
of the current when over-strong currents are used, may be proved by using weaker
currents and progressively pushing the needle-point terminals further and further into
the gelatinous substance of the nectocalyx.
