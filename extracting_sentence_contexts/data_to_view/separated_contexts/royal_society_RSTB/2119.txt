In 1886 the fine paper of FrenzExt appeared (“ Mikrographie der Mitteldarmdriise
(Leber) der Mollusken ”), followed in 1893 by a second part, in which FRENZEL extends
his observations. In these papers he limits himself mostly to the “ glandular
epithelium,” which is figured in very elaborate coloured plates, but he confesses his
difficulties in obtaining sections of the gland itself. In fact the usual hardening
agents employed by FrRENzEL made the preparation so hard and brittle that he could
not cut useful sections of the gland. While accepting Barrurrn’s conclusion that the “ferment cell” of that author
prepares a ferment, FRENzEL changed the name to “club cells,” or “ club-shaped
ferment cells” (Keulen-zellen, or keulenformige Ferment-zellen), and to the liver
cells of Barrurtu he gave the name of “ granular” cells (Kérnerzellen). I think it is due to myself that I should here call attention to the way in which
FRENzEL has misrepresented a statement of mine.
