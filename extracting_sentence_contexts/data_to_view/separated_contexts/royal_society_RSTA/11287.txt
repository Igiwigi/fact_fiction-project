Let the departure from the original
reading be called the deficiency, and let D, represent the deficiency when ¢ minutes
have elapsed after return to the original pressure. ‘Thus D,—which we may call
the original deficiency—is the difference between the descending and ascending
readings, answering to the pressure of 30 inches.

- According to the first 24 experiments, Dy is, at least approximately, proportional
to the pressure range. The evidence for this conclusion is summarised in Table XV. ;
‘the figures are deduced from the mean values calculated from the several experiments
‘pver the same range.

£& The abnormal entry 29 for aneroid No. 3 is really due to the occurrence of
"appreciable permanent changes of zero in the course of 2 experiments over the
grange 30-21 inches. On one of these occasions, after a full day’s rest, the aneroid
Bead no less than ‘08 inch lower than before the experiment.
s The irregularity in the other results is due partly to the comparative fewness of
‘Ethe experiments, and partly to the fact that the pressure at the end of the experi-
Ament was in reality to some extent different from that at the start. It was usual, in
fact, to treat the atmospheric pressure at the time being as 30 inches, unless it
exceeded this value by several tenths of an inch.
§ 21. In the 24 experiments the aneroids were read at intervals of 5, 10, 15, 20,
60, 120, and 1440 minutes after the return to atmospheric pressure.
