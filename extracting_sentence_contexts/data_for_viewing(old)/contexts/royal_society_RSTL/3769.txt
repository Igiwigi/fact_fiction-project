jected kidneys, in many of which he has been able to detect the tube passing from the Malpighian body,
since his attention was directed to this arrangement. He also showed me a very beautiful injection of the Mal-
pighian bodies in the Horze, sent over to the Microscopical Society of London by Prof. Hysrt, of Prague. In
one corner of this we found a similar extravasation, though the disposition in question seems to have eluded the
attention of that excellent anatomist. I am indebted to Mr. Quzxevr for some finely injected specimens of a
boa's kidney, from one of which fig. 14, is taken,

laries by innumerable ayenues. But towards the Malpighian bodies, there is no
opening from this capillary network at all corresponding in magnitude or freedom to
that on the side of the veins. In fact, the only points by which it can discharge
itself are the efferent vessels of the Malpighian bodies, which are comparatively few
in number, only capillary in size, and quite disconnected with one another, except
through the plexus itself. Add to this, that the Malpighian tuft to which they lead
is a great obstacle to the passage of fluid, from the tortuosity of its minute vessels,
and by their all having but one point to discharge themselves of the blood they
already contain, viz. their afferent vessel. Thus to fluid driven through the kidney
in a retrograde course, there is not only the general impediment offered by the
aggregate capacity of the arteries being greatly inferior to that of the veins, but a
yascular arrangement equivalent to a double valve. The capillaries of the tubes form
a first great cul-de-sac, those of the Malpighian tufts a second, for these may both
be described as great reservoirs, easily entered from the side of the arteries, but dis-
charging themselves with great difficulty back again, or towards the arterial tree.
