Their reactions to ammonia
and caustic soda are the same as described by the above authors, but after treatment
with hydrochloric acid no separation of uric acid crystals occurs after the initial
rapid solution, as takes place in Rhodnius, Reptiles, and Birds. STUDIES ON THE ONYCHOPHORA 459

The difference between Peripatopsis and other Arthropoda in the size and pro-
perties of their uric acid crystals, and in the methods of formation and removal of
these crystals, indicate an independent acquisition of this type of metabolism by the
ancestral Onychophora. Nephridia or Segmental Excretory Organs

The presence of a long series of well-developed nephridia, structurally resembling
the segmental excretory organs of other Arthropoda, may seem remarkable in view
of the fact that they are unimportant in removing nitrogenous waste, the intestine
having taken on this function. The only nitrogenous matter which could be detected
in the nephridial fluid is ammonia, and it is noteworthy that this is also the chief
excretory product of annelid nephridia (DELAuNAy, 1931). Nephridia, however,
also regulate both salt and water content of the body. “‘ The observation that the
urine of Peripatopsis is hypotonic to the blood is at first sight surprising since Peri-
patopsis is a terrestrial animal and might be expected to conserve water rather than
salt.
