Doe. cit., 8ame page. 224 CAPTAIN NOBLE AND MR. F. A. ABEL ON FIRED GUNPOWDER,

In fact, one of the principal objects of our experiments was tb determine this very
point, and we therefore considered it necessary, at all events in the first instance, to
determine the heat generated when gunpowder is fired in considerable quantities and
under high tensions. To do this, vessels of great strength, consequently of great weight, and therefore
not well snited for calorimetric observations, were necessary. It will presently be seen, however, that the difference betyween the determinations
made by us and those of the other experimenters alluded to by General Morix and
M. BerTHELOT are due, not to error in our determinations, but to essential and striking
differences in the decomposition of different descriptions of powder.
