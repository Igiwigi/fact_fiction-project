(U, H, Q)=0, and hence if one of the two Jacobians, Jac. (U, H, Qg),

Jac. (U, H, Qx) vanish, the other will also vanish, Now, using the canonical form

=a"+* ++ 6layz,
we have
$2=(A;> > 02

=(y2—Pa*, zx—Pp, ay—P2, Pyz—la*, Pzax—ly*, Pay —#Y

X —3Pa, —8Py, —3Pz, (1+27)s, (1+2P)y, (1+2P): ),
the development of which in fact gives the Jast-mentioned result. But applying this
formula to the calculation of Jac. (U, H, Qz), then disregarding numerical factors, we
have

d,Qg=(y2—Pa?, ., .
