In addition to these fibres there are also a few cells
scattered throughout the layer ; they rezemble the largest sized cells of the fourth
layer, but are on an average of Slightly larger dimensions ; sometimes they have three
processes, one of which can be traced for some distance into the complex of fibres
forming the exit of the nerve. The sixth layer is formed of finely granular material
resembling that of the third layer ; i occupies the anterior end of the tuberculum,
and forms a sort of kernel round which the other layers are placed. We have now described those parts of the brain of Mormyrus which differ from, and
