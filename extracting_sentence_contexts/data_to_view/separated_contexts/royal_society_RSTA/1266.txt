Different degrees of secondary bending during the SLS test for
different size meshes, as suggested by the experimental data in figure 2b, were believed to result in
different peel stresses at the weldline and consequently to cause the strength evolution observed
in figure 2a. Second, the welding process may affect the adherends resulting in. e.g. deformed adherends
(induction weld in figure 1c) versus non-deformed adherends (ultrasonic and resistance welds in
figure 1a,b). In fact, there are welding processes such as susceptorless induction welding of carbon

fibre-reinforced composites in which the adherends experience through-the-thickness heating in
the overlap region [25]. Application of the welding pressure may hence result in matrix squeeze
out and consequently in tapered adherends (figure 1c).
