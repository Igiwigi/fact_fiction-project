and I have seen them in both transverse and longitudinal sections.* In the above-
mentioned stage, the mesoderm forming the two coelomic cavities is not joined
medially, nor is it connected with the mesoderm surrounding the stomodaeum.
Before the development of the labral coelomic cavities, the labral and stomodaeal
mesoderm are seen to be connected together by means of loose strands of mesoderm
(fig. 125). The labral coelomic cavities are pre-oral in position. By the
72-hours stage they have disappeared, leaving in their place a rather loose
mass of mesoderm which still exhibits a paired arrangement. Shortly after-
wards the labral mesoderm again becomes connected with the mesoderm
investing the stomodaeum, and eventually gives rise to the labral musculature.
The only other insect, besides Locusta migratoria, in which labral coelomic
cavities have so far been recorded is Carausius morosus (W1ESMANN, 1926),
where also they are evanescent. A difference, however, lies in the fact that
whereas in Carausius the walls of the labral coelomic cavities are connected medially,
in Locusta they are not. Although in no other insects have labral coeloms been
recorded, the existence in the labrum of paired mesodermal masses, which no doubt
represent the vestiges of coelomic cavities, have been shown in some insects. â€˜Thus
Heymons (1895, a) found them in Forficula and Carriere and Burcer (1897) and
STRINDBERG (1915, a) in some Hymenoptera. EastHam (1930, 6) describes two
pairs of mesodermal masses in front of the antennae. These are the labral and the
epipharyngeal, the latter being secondarily separated from the former and having no
segmental significance. Irregular cavities may appear in both of these mesodermal
masses, but are quite unlike true coelomic cavities, and are not regarded as such
by this author. Manton (1928, pp. 454-455) is inclined to question the validity of
regarding the labral coelom sacs of Carausius morosus (W1ESMANN, 1926) as being
