dominance and emergent function, is of central consequence for NPF-BI (table 2).

(ii) Feedbacks and interactions

Feedbacks across ecological processes set trajectories of change that need to be either disrupted or facilitated to maintain net positive
biodiversity and ecosystem outcomes. The dominance of negative feedbacks from intraspecific interactions (density dependence), for
example, drive and maintain species rich communities, whereas positive feedbacks (such as facilitation, biotic-abiotic interactions) can
drive the composition of communities towards single species dominants [61]. Invasion-driven meltdown may occur when introduced
species alter the local biotic or abiotic environment in ways that start to exclude native community members. However, in both plant
and animal communities, species richness can mediate the likelihood of directional invasion resulting from invader impacts on abiotic
conditions (such as plant-soil feedbacks) [62]. For example in a sessile epibenthic fouling community, space availability and species
richness (regardless of species origin) drove introduced species abundance, showing that trajectories to invasion meltdown are not | ~.

In some cases, novel interactions contribute to net positive outcomes for biodiversity and ecosystems [14,67,68]. For example, with e-)
