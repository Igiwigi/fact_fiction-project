Later discoveries revealed that it is a
prevomer, the true vomer lying above it. The vomer-like bone which supports the
secondary palate in the Cynodonts was also regarded as a true vomer. Later facts
revealed good reasons for considering this also as the prevomer. The study of many skulls of Therocephalians and Gorgonopsians showed beyond doubt
that the apparently single median bone in the front of the palate, lying between the
internal nares, is really a pair of prevomers. In most Therocephalians the bones are
fused, but in some smaller forms (e.g., Ictidognathus hemburyi) the two bones remain
distinct apparently throughout life.
