7. Conclusion

LES in the near future will be a real alternative to RANS. There is little doubt
about this, and a lot of effort has been expended making LES, DES and other
hybrid methods more robust for industrial use. Indeed, most CFD packages
FLUENT, STARCCM, etc.) now include by default LES options (even sometimes
DNS). However, careful attention needs to be paid to knowledge transfer, and we
should learn from some of the mistakes encountered when RANS was introduced
into industry, and an awareness of the limitations of LES is needed. For this
purpose Hutton (2009) rightly advocates the development of best practices
guidelines. However, these should not detract from the fact that the safe use o:
LES needs a level of fundamental understanding.

Again, LES should be seen as a complementary tool to experiments, and wil
not, in the foreseeable future, replace testing, and industrial practitioners should
ye aware of those limits. Indeed, a closer collaboration between experimentalists
and numericists is required both for developing accurate tools and for using them
o their full potential.

The need for more careful characterization of experimental/numerica.
soundary and initial conditions was illustrated in many of the meeting papers.

There was the feeling that for LES to make most speedy industrial impact,
