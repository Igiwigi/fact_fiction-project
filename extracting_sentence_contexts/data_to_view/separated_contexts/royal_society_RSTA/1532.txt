And the name was easy to choose; a Mesonema
type jellyfish found in Victoria harbour... Mesonema victoria... . but the genus was moved back
to Aequorea a few years later and so we now celebrate Aequorea victoria... the Victory of the Sea,
catchy isn’t it! While luminescence in medusae was a known fact for nearly two millennia when Pliny in
the first century described a luminous slime from the bell of ‘Pulmo marinus’ (probably Pelagia
Noctiluca) that could be spread on surfaces making them glow, later studies by the renowned
anatomist Spallan (1798) showed that this phenomenon continues after the death of the animal. The understanding of luminescence in invertebrates came to light when the French physiologist
Raphael Dubois (1887) decided to ‘juice out’ a bunch of Pholas dactylus clams, or common piddock,
that graced him with light! (see below). The juice idea was not lost as nearly a century later Osamu
Shimomura [6] collected bucket loads of Aequorea victoria and purified their light-emitting organs
through a gauze to obtain what they called the ‘squeezate’ [6].
