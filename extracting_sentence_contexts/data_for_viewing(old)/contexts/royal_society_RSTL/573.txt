-nature of their surrounding strata, on the vestiges of animal
and vegetable bodies which accompany them, and on various
other local facts; all of which tend considerably to elucidate the
history of their formation, and to throw light upon this interest-
ing part of geology.

Some instances have already been mentioned, which show
that fossil animal substances form a series, commencing with
Such as are scarcely different from those which are recent, and
terminating in productions which have totally lost all traces of
organization.

Similar instances are afforded by the vegetable kingdom; but,
without entering into a minute detail of every gradation, I shall
only cite three examples in this island, namely,
