We must
therefore either look for cases in which two wind systems are in some way opposed, or else
assume the possible reflexion of wave energy from a steep coast. Bernard suggested that favourable conditions for wave interference would be found at the
centre of a cyclonic depression, where waves originating on all sides of the depression might
be received. It is known that in a circular depression the winds, though mainly along the
isobars, have also a component inwards towards the centre, and in fact observation of sea
conditions in the ‘eye’ of a cyclone tend to confirm this expectation. It is well known that in
such regions relatively low wind velocities may be combined with high and chaotic seas such
as would be characteristic of wave interference. Suppose then that in the centre of a circular depression in the Atlantic wave energy is
being received equally from all directions with a range of periods between 10 and 16sec.
