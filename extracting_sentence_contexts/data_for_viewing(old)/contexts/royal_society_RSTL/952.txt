give them the curyature required, has a considerable share in
weakening the general fabric. That they occasion a great
consumption of materials, is obvious, as the ends of the two
rib-pieces must first be cut away, and then be replaced by the
chock.

This mode of putting together the frame, is also peculiar
to the English ship-builder ; and I find, from an old work in
my possession, dedicated to GroRGe the First, that the prac-
tice was introduced in the construction of English ships about
the year 1714; and having heard that so unfriendly to it was
the builder (Mr. Nais1) of the Royal William, that he re-
fused to adopt it; and being desirous of ascertaining the fact,
when that ship was taken to pieces at Portsmouth, in 1818, I
found that she was built without the wedge pieces or chocks,
to which, in a certain degree, I ascribe her strength and dura-
bility ; her ribs being by her structure less grain-cut, and
for want of chocks, less liable to decay in those parts where
they are inserted.

The introduction of chocks, was no doubt to procure that
curvature which is 50 necessary in the formation of a ship,
when crooked or compass timber became scarce; as may be
seen by Pl, VIII. Fig. 2. which describes the shape of a piece
of timber in the converted form ; and by which it will also be
