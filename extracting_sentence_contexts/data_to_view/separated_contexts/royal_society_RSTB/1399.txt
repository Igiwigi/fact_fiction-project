The limit between phloém and internal periderm is not always
In favourable cases, however, where the delicate phloém happens to be
jarly well preserved, or where, perhaps, it was developed in unusual amount,
s structure is clear. This is the case, for example, in the largest specimen,

Adjoining the wood we see evident remains of the tabular cambial cells.
these we find a group of thin-walled tissue, in which the arrangement of the
