5 Review of Results.

2 It is important to compare the results obtained with the foregoing CH,+0,+«CO
emixtures, not only amongst themselves, but also with the results of the corresponding
experiments with the CH,+O,+«H, mixtures.

= In the first place, it is evident that the affinities of either hydrogen or carbon

g monoxide are greatly inferior to that of methane for oxygen in explosion flames ;

thus it may be inferred from the experiments with CH,+0,+2H, that the ratio

Bof the affinities CH,/H, is of the order 20 or 30 to 1 at least, and probably

Shigher, if the influence of the walls of the containing vessel could be entirely

¥ eliminated. Q& Owing to the uncertainty of our knowledge as to the precise mechanism of the
combustion of carbon monoxide in explosions, that is to say, as to the extent and
character of the intermediary action of steam, itis perhaps difficult to assign, even
approximately, any numerical relation between the affinities of methane and carbon
monoxide for oxygen in flames. Nevertheless, it may be pointed out, without laying
undue stress on the fact, that when the mixtures, initially containing methane, hydrogen
or carbon monoxide, and oxygen in stochiochemical proportions (7.e., CH,+O,+2H, and
CH,+0,+2CO), were exploded under similar conditions in bomb B, the carbon
monoxide was apparently more effective than hydrogen in pulling away oxygen from
the predominating affinity of the hydrocarbon. From the theoretical standpoint it
