In this
organ we think, reason, desire, and will. In short, the brain is the instrument by
which all the operations called intellectual are carried on. It is proved by facts and
observations that animals partake of feelings, sensations, and intellectual faculties in
a higher degree, and approach more nearly to mankind in proportion as their brain
resem√æles more the human brain. An intimate connexion between the structure of
the brain and the intellectual faculties in the animal kingdom cannot be doubted. As the facts which we have advanced plainly prove that there are no well-marked
and essential differences between the brain of the Negro and European, we must con-
clude that no innate difference in the intellectual faculties can be admitted to exist
between them.
