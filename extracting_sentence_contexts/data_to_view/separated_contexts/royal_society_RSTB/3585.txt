A small amount of fat is usually associated with these

. yellow granules which, consequently, stain red with Sudan or Scharlach ; but fat is
possibly not an essential constituent of the yellow granules; under certain conditions
it appears to be almost wanting, and, when present, may form merely an enveloping film. The substance and pigment of the yellow granules present in the giant and ganglion
cells are closely similar to, if not identical with, those of the chlorogogen granules, a
fact which indicates that the granules in the nerve cells are probably insoluble
products of metabolism (pp. 454-462). 3.8 2
