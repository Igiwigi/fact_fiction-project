In appropriate cases it fixes the mixed-path curve at
sufficiently great distances beyond the boundary, and together with the further reasonable
assumption that, to a first order, the curve for points up to the boundary coincides with the
corresponding curve appropriate to a homogeneous earth, gives some indication of the field-
strength variation. The point we wish to make here, however, is that use of equation (38) is
only justifiable in special circumstances. The present analysis suggests a criterion for its
validity, namely, that the transmitter and receiver should be large numerical distances from
the boundary relative to medium 1 and medium 2 respectively, speaking in terms of the
model of figure 1; in fact, that this condition is both necessary and sufficient is established
more rigorously in part IT. The limitations of equation (38) are perhaps most vividly brought out by noticing that
(37) is equivalent to an application of ray theory using an effective reflexion coefficient of

1; for, from (26), this gives the field

but since (32) must be presumed to hold, we have
k(S—d) =2kh?/d<1, (40)
and hence (39) approximates to (37); furthermore, p(siny) +—1 if sinyy<|sing,|, an
inequality which is implicit in (35) and (40). In the problem which we are about to consider,
one of the media is a perfect conductor and therefore has a constant reflexion coeflicient of
1; in this case it appears most forcibly that no argument can be suggested by which the
field can be quickly estimated when the transmitter and receiver are on opposite sides of the
boundary in positions which are sufliciently near the earth’s surface to be of interest, and it
seems that convincing results can only be obtained by a thorough analytical investigation,

To this we now proceed.
