In this section, we give a brief overview of the work of Hafedh Herichi and the author on
the aspects of quantized number theory. This work is presented in a series of research and
survey articles [9-12], and described in detail in [8]. More specifically, in [8-12], the main object
of investigation is the spectral operator, sending the geometry onto the spectrum of a fractal
string. Originally seen as acting on the space of (generalized) fractal strings, it is now viewed
mathematically (and physically) as a suitable quantization of the Riemann zeta function: a = ¢(d),
where @ is a suitable version of the differentiation operator d/df, called the infinitesimal shift of
the real line and acting on the Hilbert space H, = L?(R, e~*"' dé), a weighted L?-space; see §4b.
Accordingly, the spectral operator a= ac depends on a parameter c which can be thought of


heuristically as providing an upper bound for the Minkowski dimensions of the fractal strings on
which the operator a acts. In fact, as we shall see in §4a, it is more convenient to replace the fractal
strings themselves by their associated (geometric and spectral) counting functions. As it turns
out, the spectral operator, a = ¢(0), which was originally introduced at the semi-heuristic level in
[7, §6.3.1 and §6.3.2] (see also [7, §6.3.1 and §6.3.2]) satisfies (at the operator theoretic level) most of
the properties of the classic Riemann zeta function ¢ = ¢(s), including a quantized Dirichlet series,
a quantized Euler product and an operator-valued ‘analytic continuation’. (See §4c, along with
([8, ch. 7], [12]).) One of the key motivations of the work in [8-12] is to obtain a rigorous functional
analytic version of the work of the author and H. Maier in [4] on inverse spectral problems for
fractal strings and the RH briefly described in §3b. This goal is achieved (see §4d) by studying the
quasi-invertibility of the spectral operator as a function of the parameter c in the critical interval
(0,1), which is the natural range of possible dimensions of fractal strings, leaving aside the least
and most fractal cases. In this light, the RH is true if and only if the midfractal case c= 3 is the
only exception to the quasi-invertibility of a; see §4d.
