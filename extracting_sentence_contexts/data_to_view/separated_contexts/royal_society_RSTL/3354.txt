From some appearances
frequently presented by the fasciculi of insects at their margins, and of which an ex-
ample is given in fig, 70. a, it would appear that this adhesion takes place to the most
prominent parts of the fibrillze, or, in other words, to the rims of the transverse dises
which result from their union. The outer scolloped line in similar cases has no doubt
been often mistaken for the outer margin of the fibrille. It is, in fact, indicative of
the bulging sarcolemma, which is bound down to the prominent extremities of the

light striz, between which the real margin of the fibrille recedes from it, with an
intervening fluid. Now in this specimen the interior of the fasciculus is in focus ; a
central row of corpuscles is there een, and the view of the margin thus represented
is, in fact, such as would be obtained by a horizontal section. This fasciculus is thus
proved to present on its surface a series of transverse grooves, to which the sheath
does not adhere, and in which a fluid is collected.
