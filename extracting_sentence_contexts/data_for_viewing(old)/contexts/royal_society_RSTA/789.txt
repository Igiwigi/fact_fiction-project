Therefore,

efcommute <> N, and Ny have the same parity.

Similarly, :2
f,gcommute <=> Ny and Ng have the same parity, 5

egcommute <> N, and Ng have the same parity, (2
and the result follows. a : oo

Note that this new definition can be used to derive an alternative proof of the fact that any [8
AVN triple for n-partite states can be reduced to an AvN triple that involves only three qubits, in :s
accordance with theorem 4.5. Indeed, given an AvN triple (e,f,g) in Pn, as Ng, Ne, Ny are odd, we :&
can always choose three indices 1 < i, i2, 13 < n such that

Cir =f Fir Cn Fly =8n and Ci, =8i, Afis-

Clearly, the elements of the triple restricted to these indices constitute an AvN triple in P3 and
therefore an AVN argument.

The rationale for introducing definition 5.1 is that it allows us to better understand AvN triples
from a computational perspective. We show a first example by providing a closed formula for the
number of AvN triples in Py.
