Accepted: 5 September 2021 We explicitly perform phase space volume integrals
over shells of constant energy and enstrophy.
Two applications are considered. In the first part,

‘Mathematical problems in physical fluid highly condensed flow configurations and show that
dynamics (part 2)’. the result is consistent with Kraichnan’s canonical

ensemble description, despite the fact that no

applied mathematics, mathematical physics, part, we compute the probability density for the
fluid mechanics, statistical physics largest-scale mode of a free-slip flow in a square,

which displays reversals. We test the results against
numerical simulations of a minimal model and find
excellent agreement with the microcanonical theory,

unlike the canonical theory, which fails to describe the
flow, truncated Euler equations, turbulence, bimodal statistics.
