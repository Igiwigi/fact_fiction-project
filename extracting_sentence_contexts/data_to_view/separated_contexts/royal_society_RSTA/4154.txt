Therefore, the
physically relevant, non-trivial solution with minimum Fisher information corresponds to K = 1. Furthermore, as E(@) is a function of a: M=cos 6 only, we must have ¢ = 0, 2. Therefore, for the
SG experiment, the solution of the robust optimization problem reads

ltixa-M

P(x|a-M,Z)=P(x|4,Z)=—>

(2.6)

The + sign in equation (2.6) reflects the fact that the mapping between x=+1 and the two
different directions is only determined up to a sign. Mn the course of deriving equation (2.5), our criterion of robustness enforces the intuitively obvious assignment P(x | 6,Z) =
n,/N, establishing the relationship between the epistemological concept (i-prob) and the physically measurable quantity
(frequency of outcomes). It is at this point that the possibility to view the i-prob as a ‘subjective’ assignment is eliminated [22].
