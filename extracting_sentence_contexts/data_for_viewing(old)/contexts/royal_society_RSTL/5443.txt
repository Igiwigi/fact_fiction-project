But N=0 makes » vanish, and therefore, upon this supposition, f and © would appear
to have a common algebraical factor þ, that is to say, N vanishing, would appear to
imply that the resnltant of f and © mast vanish, 80 that N would appear to be con-
tained as a factor in this general resultant, which latter is, however, clearly inde-
composable into factors—a seeming paradox—the solution of which must be sought
for in the fact, that the equation N=0 is incompatible with the existence of the usual
equations (7.) connecting f, ©, 4 and @: but this failure of the existence of the
equations (7.) (bearing in mind that N has been shown to be a function only of the
s8et of coefficients &, 3, &c;), can only happen by reason” of « vanishing whenever N
vanishes ; « must therefore be a root of N, or which is the same thing, N a power of

The same result may be obtained & posteriors by actually performing the successive
divisions; if the coefficients of any dividend be a, b, c, d, &c., and of 'the divisor
