To mimic such physiological actions in
the modelled network, we explored variable changes in the dis-

output of pyramidal cell activity was represented by a stochastic glu- networked BCs. In the present context, our principal aim was
tamatergic synaptic currents (V;.t = 0 mV, see ยง2b for the kinetics) to understand the implications of the fact that individual astro-

stochastic excitatory synaptic input to individual interneurons was variable-size clusters of neighbouring BCs and compared the
set at the average synaptic discharge frequency of fy = 300 Hz, in outcome with that under a quantitatively identical action dis-

line with earlier estimates, giving a sustained network oscillation
frequency of 18-22 Hz (close to the gamma-frequency range for
CA1 or CA3 interneuronal networks).
