Some of the
& boundaries in this case appear irregular, but a rather higher magnification shows that
e these apparently irregular boundaries are made up of numerous short straight lines.
g This photograph is also interesting as the etching had not been carried so far as in
> most of the other cases and the etched pits are not contiguous. It hence gives some
© idea as to the manner in which they are formed. Be Such straight boundaries are a strong indication that the portions on either side
= are connected by a twin relation, and the fact is further brought out when we
examine the geometrical relation of the pits on either side. It has been said above
2 that these pits, which are portions of a cubo-octahedron, are placed in a correct
§ direction to the crystalline axes, and are in fact representations in miniature of what
S the external form of the crystal would probably be if allowed to assume its proper
& shape. Take the case shown in fig. 14: we have two main orientations in the picture,
€. one having pits with a large hexagonal face nearly parallel ‘to, and the other having
pits with a cubic face parallel to, the surface.
