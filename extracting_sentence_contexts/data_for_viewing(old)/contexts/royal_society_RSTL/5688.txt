maintained this medium width as long as I continued to examine the animal, namely,
three hours.

From this and other similar observations, IT infer that full dilatation of the arteries is
a merely passive phenomenon as respects the parietes of the vessels. Contraction is
effected by the muscular fibre-cells of their circular coat, on the relaxation of which
the elasticity of the arteries tends to make them expand to a certain degree, beyond
which they do not dilate, except in s0 far as they are distended by the blood.

It was observed by Wnarrox JoxesÂ®, that section of the sciatic nerve in the thigh of
a frog was followed after a time by edema of the limb and exfoliation of the epidermis.
If this were dependent on the dilatation of the arteries produced by the division of the
nerve, the fact would have a very important bearing upon the cause of inflammatory
effusion. 1 find, however, that neither edema nor exfoliation results from permanent
full dilatation produced by operations upon the cord or the roots of the spinal nerves;
while, on the contrary, both took place in the case of division of the sciatic, given in
the early part of this paper, in which it will be remembered that the arteries reco-
vered their contractility completely within half an hour, and presented, during the next
twenty-four hours, precisely similar appearances with those in the other foot. Hence
it is evident that the phenomena in question are not due to vascular relaxation, but t9
some other cireumstances attending the operation performed upon the thigh.

It remains to be added, that, in a healthy state of the web, no change in the proper
ties of the blood was ever observed to accompany the constriction of the arteries 0
irritation of the cord, or the dilatation which followed the destruction of the nervous
