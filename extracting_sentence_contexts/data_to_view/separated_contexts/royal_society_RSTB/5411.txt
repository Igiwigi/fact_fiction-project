Introduction. The justification of the following paper is found in the fact that notwithstanding the
investigations of DuaEs (1834), GEGENBAUR (1861, 1862, 1876), Hassr (1892), ZyKoFF
(1893), GorPPERT (1895), Perer (1895), Gapow (1896), KaPELKIN (1900), SCHAUINS-
LAND (1906) and EMELIANOFF (1925), which deal with the development of the vertebral
column in Urodela, there still remains a great deal of uncertainty as to the relationship
which exists, first, between the arches, the intervertebral and the vertebral bodies ;
secondly, as to the exact constituent parts of the neural and the hemal arches ; thirdly,
as to whether any change takes place in the developing vertebra as it passes from its
cartilaginous condition to its ossified stage, for none of the above-mentioned workers
has traced the full development to the adult condition ; fourthly, as to the development
of the first (atlas) vertebra and its relation to the occipital region ; lastly, as to how the
Urodelan skull has developed two condyles for articulation with the first vertebra. The writer desires to acknowledge his indebtedness to Prof. E. W. MacBripr, who,
with valuable advice and criticism, has greatly facilitated these researches. He has
also to acknowledge his obligations to Mr. H. R. Hewer, Mr. N. Murti, Mr. P. Gray,
and Mr. C. Joun for their kind assistance, which has led to the improvement of this
paper.
