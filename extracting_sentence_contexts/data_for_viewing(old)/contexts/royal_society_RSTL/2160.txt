permanent? Would a mixed atmosphere, which in fact as a
whole, consisted of equal weights of carbonic acid and hydro-
gen, continue to exhibit at the surface of the earth equal
volumes only in mixture ? - Or, on the other hand, would not
the whole be wrought up in due time into one uniform com-
position in all its extent, of 20 volumes of hydrogen with one
of carbonic acid, as many suppose to be the nature of the
earth's atmosphere with regard to its component parts ?

Before these questions are discussed we shall put the case
in a different form : suppose a mixture of 20 volumes of
hydrogen and one volume of carbonic acid (that is equal
weights of each), were put into a large reseryoir under the
