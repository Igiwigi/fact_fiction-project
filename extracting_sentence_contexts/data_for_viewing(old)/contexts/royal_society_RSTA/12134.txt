in the case of a few heavy metals, particularly lead and manganese. Metallic lead
and its compounds were found to yield the same band spectrum in the oxy-hydrogen
flame, and manganese exhibited a curious spectrum of the Ist Order, most similar
to that of carbon, but with the lines composing the bands differently distributed.
The well-known spark spectra of these elements are spectra of the 2nd Order.

Lecog bE BoisBaupRAN has’ observed a beautiful spectrum of aluminium of the

Ist Order, obtained by means of an uncondensed spark. That this metal at so high
a temperature yields such a spectrum is undoubtedly due to the fact that it is
almost, if not absolutely, impossible to vaporize it with the oxy-hydrogen flame.

Livernc and Dewar have recently obtained a band spectrum by the combustian
of nickel tetracarbonyl which is also accompanied by lines (‘ Roy. Soc, Proc., vol. 52,
p. 117). This spectrum, I expect, will be found to be due to metallic nickel and not
to the compound substance. ,

Yttrium and scandium, in solutions of their chlorides, each yield a line spectrum,
with a group of bands in the red and orange region, when submitted to the action of
a condensed spark. From the foregoing facts, and from the descriptions of spectra
which here follow, it will be seen that several metallic elements emit banded spectra.
