that in the distinctly cumulate placenta like that of fig. 5, Rodentia (Mouse), The
“bordure verte” and the ‘ poches choriales” are more comparable to the lacune of the
sheep than of the mouse.

Just as the sheep is at the extreme end of the series of plicate placentas nearest
the cumulata, so the carnivore is on the border line near the plicata; for, in the
ferret, according to Roprnson’s (82) account of the development of that animal, the
plasmoditrophoblast is reduced to a minimum, and Straut’s account of the placenta of
the Carnivora, which differs very much from Duvat’s, still more suggests the plicate
character.

Perhaps the most striking difference between the carnivore and sheep’s placenta is
the fact that in the sheep there are special trophospongial areas which cause
the polycotyledonary form. But these are strictly maternal structures, and the
effect which a strictly maternal character has upon the forms of placenta does not
seem to me to be of so fundamental a nature as characters of the trophoblast itself
—the organ par eacellence of placentation.

Close here the placenta of the Chiroptera must be placed. It is clearly cumulate,
and by a breaking down eventually of the maternal tissue in the angioplasmode the
maternal blood is left extravasated in the plasmoditrophoblast, a feature characteristic
of the more perfectly cumulate types as in

Fig. 5, which is the placenta of a rodent such as mouse. (This figure is drawn
from the placenta of Acomys cahirinus.)
