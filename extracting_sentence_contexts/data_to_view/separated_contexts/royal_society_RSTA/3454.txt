However, large uncertainties : =
for future projections of ocean deoxygenation remain for the subsurface tropical oceans where : S
the major oxygen minimum zones are located. Here, Bopp and co-authors combine global : 2
warming projections, model-based estimates of natural short-term variability, as well as data : &
and model estimates of the Last Glacial Maximum ocean oxygenation to gain some insights _
into the major mechanisms of oxygenation changes across these different time scales. They show : Ss
that the primary uncertainty on future ocean deoxygenation in the subsurface tropical oceans Dh
is in fact controlled by a robust compensation between decreasing oxygen saturation due to 13
warming and decreasing apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) due to increased ventilation of : eS

the corresponding water masses. Modelled short-term natural variability in subsurface oxygen
levels also reveals a compensation between oxygen saturation and AOU, controlled by the
latter. Finally, using a model simulation of the Last Glacial Maximum, reproducing data-based
reconstructions of past ocean (de)oxygenation, they show that the deoxygenation trend of the
subsurface ocean during the deglaciation was controlled by a combination of warming-induced
decreasing oxygen saturation and increasing AOU driven by a reduced ventilation of tropical
subsurface waters.
