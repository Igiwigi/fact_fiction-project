Tn describing the movements of each of these segments we shall give (i.) the total
or absolute representation in each instance, (ii.) the primary representation, (iii.) the
character of the movements comprising (a) the total or absolute representation of
the part, and (b) the primary representation.

By the expression total or absolute representation of any segment, we mean that
we have extracted from our records every single movement of each given segment at

& every one of our centres where that segment happened to be represented. The

summation of these facts gives correctly the actual total amount of representation of
each joint at each centre, and consequently tells us to what extent, as determined by
electrical stimulation, that joint or segment is represented in the cerebral cortex.

The second heading under which we have classified our observations, viz., that
of primary representation, requires little explanation, since, unlike the first heading
just described, it defines the region in which any particular joint begins the general
movement of the limb, excluding, of course, secondary, tertiary, or even quaternary
representations of the segment of the limb, all these being included under the first
heading.

The determination of the representation of the primary movement is of the greatest
importance, since upon this rests the exact localisation of the starting point of
