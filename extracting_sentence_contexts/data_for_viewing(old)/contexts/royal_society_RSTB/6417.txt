The highest proportion of infection is obtained after 2 to 5 minutes’ feeding on the
infected plant. This might be explained in two ways. (a) More virus may be
available to the aphid in those areas of the leaf which the stylets reach after two
minutes’ feeding ; (6) the drop in percentage infection with longer feeding periods
may be caused by some effect on the virus produced within the insect.

a. Availability of Virus in the Leaf—-BENNETT (1934) found that the virus of curly
top of sugar-beet is confined to the phloem, and cannot be obtained from other
tissues of the plant, and therefore it can only be carried by an insect which feeds
upon the phloem. Similarly a connexion between other viruses, for example, that
of potato leaf-roll, and the phloem tissues, have led to a general suggestion that the
success of many vectors may be attributed to the fact of their being phloem feeders.

The rates of penetration of the stylets of Myzus persicae into tobacco leaves, similar
to those used for the aphid infections, are being investigated and the results so far
indicate that more than 5 minutes is required for the stylets to reach the phloem.*
Since the percentage infection obtained after 2 minutes on the infected plant is so
high it seems probable that Hy. III can be obtained from tissues other than the
phloem, and that either the concentration of virus is higher in the superficial tissues
than in the phloem or the subsequent fall in percentage infection is due to an
independent action of the aphid on the virus.

b. Effect on the Virus of Conditions Within the Aphid—The aphids are starved for a few
hours before feeding on the infected plant (p. 459) and this treatment may have had
