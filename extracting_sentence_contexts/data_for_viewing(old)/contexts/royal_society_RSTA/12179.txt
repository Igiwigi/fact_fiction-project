divided by 87; and this must be 4pv*, where p is its density and v its velocity,
Now from Professor Loper’s result the velocity corresponding to the c.g.s. unit of
netic force is less than ‘2 centimetre per second; hence the inertia of the wther
aust exceed twice that of water. The elasticity must of course be taken large in
proportion to the density, in order to preserve the proper velocity of radiation. In
ew of the very great intensity of the chemical and electrical forces acting between
the atoms in the molecule, values even much greater than these would not appear
xcessive. But on the other hand such a value of the density requires us to make
he «ther absolutely stationary except in a magnetic field, in order to avoid
hydrodynamical forcives between moving bodies. The residual forcive between
odies at rest in a field of sthereal motion, due to very slight defect of permeability,
s already been shown, after Lord Krtvin’s illustration, to simulate diamagnetism ;
nd the fact that there exist no powerfully diamagnetic substances is so far a
onfirmation of the present hypothesis. The view that the magnetic field of a
rrent involves only slight circulation of the fluid ether is also in keeping with the
account which has been given (§ 46) of the genesis of such a field.

On Magneto-Optic Rotation.

_ 83. The rotation of the plane of polarization of light in a uniform magnetic field
depends on the interaction of the uniform velocity of the wether, which constitutes
that field, with the vibrational velocity which belongs to the light-disturbance, The
niform flow in the medium we may consider to be connected with a partial orien-
tation of the vortex-molecules; the chemical or hydrodynamic vibrations, in other
