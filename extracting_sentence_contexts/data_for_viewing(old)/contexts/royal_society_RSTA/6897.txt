From two such equations (2) we may eliminate either x or y or z very readily. For
assuming C, and C, to be non-singular we have

Cy!A,x+CyByy = —z = Cy'Aox+Cz Boy:
whence Ly = Mx, (4)
where L=CB,—CyB,, M=Cy'A,—Cy"A). (5)

Equation (4), which involves certain k= & matrices L and M explicitly, gives the
collineation between points of A and points of B determined by the transversal lines of
he medials 4, B, C. When A, B, C are mutually skew these lines generate the scroll 7.
If L is non-singular we have y — Qx, where Q — L~'M; and similarly z — Rx, say, by
eliminating y from (1). The points on A, B, C of a generating line of the scroll are given
by Ax, BQx, CRx. In fact the scroll is now

loc {ps Ix, oCRx}, (6)

with p:o and x as parameters of stratum and generating line respectively. This reverts
to the previous form §1 (10) when 4 — {7,0}, CR = {0,1}.

The parametric form of the scroll, referred to the basis A — {7,0}, C {0,7} and
containing {B,, B,} as another stratum, is therefore

loc {pB, x, 7B, x}, (7)

and the points {B,x, 0} of A, {0, B,x} of C are in line with (Bx, Bx}, that is with Bx
