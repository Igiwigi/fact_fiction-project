defines a strongly continuous semigroup {Tn(t),t > 0} in H, generated by the bounded operator
An given by

An (= ta) =n ge
i=1

i=n+1

Clearly, limn—-oo Tn(f)x =x, x € H, ie. the semigroups converge to the semigroup generated by
the zero operator (and the limit is even uniform in t>0). However, the operators A,,n>1
cannot converge strongly, since ||A,|| =1, and in particular do not converge to the zero operator.
On the other hand, for any x €H, defining x, = eT &e;,n>1, we have limy-.0%, =x and
limn—oo AnXn = 0. This confirms the fact that the extended limit, and not the ‘normal’ limit, of
Ans is the limit semigroup generator.


4. Aversion with the limit semigroup defined on a subspace

In this section, for simplicity of notations and exposition, we assume that the semigroups
generated by A,,s are equibounded: ||T;,(¢)|| <M for some M > 1. The general case may be easily
reconstructed by standard techniques.

As often as not, the range condition (c) of the Trotter-Never-Kato Theorem (or its Sova—Kurtz
version) fails to be satisfied. What happens in this case is clearly seen from the perspective
of the operator A of (3.1): the entire Kisyrski’s analysis works except for the argument that
