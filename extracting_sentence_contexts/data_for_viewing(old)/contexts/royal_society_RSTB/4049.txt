Colorado Springs, namely, 110 per cent. Simultaneously there was a distinct decrease
in the total oxygen capacity, but this decrease was not nearly so marked nor did it
develop so rapidly as the decrease in the haemoglobin percentage in the case of
Hapane and Scunerer. The blood volume in these two cases was therefore as
high as, if not higher than, the maximum value obtained on the summit. A deter-
mination made on HENDERSON on the fourth day after the descent showed that the
fall in the total oxygen capacity was about proportional to the fall in the percentage
of hemoglobin, and that his blood volume was but little above his normal. We are
inclined to discard the values obtained for the total oxygen capacity and for the blood
volume at Colorado Springs on the return in the case of Douenas, as in comparison
with the subsequent observations they appear to be abnormally low and do not agree
at all with the observations made on the other members of the expedition: the values
found are, in fact, compatible with the assumption that there was a gross error of
25 cc. in the initial reading of the measuring cylinder containing the carbon
monoxide.* Perhaps the real state of affairs would be indicated by the dotted lines,
and if this were so the blood volume would have been markedly increased. Unfortu-
nately we did not have the opportunity of making another observation on Doueas
at Colorado Springs. The remaining observations on Dovanas, Haupanr, and
HENDERSON were made at New Haven, at sea-level, the last determinations there

* The old cylinder had been broken on the journey down, and the graduation of the new one was
somewhat confusing.
