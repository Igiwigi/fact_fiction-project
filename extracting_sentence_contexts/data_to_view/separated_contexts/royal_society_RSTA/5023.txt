An important first approximation had already

been made by the correction of the observed values of the angles for the geometrical
5 errors of the triangles and polygonal figures to which they respectively appertained ;
& thus, each polygonal triangulation might be converted into a chain of single triangles
3 hy employing the triangles on one flank of the polygons only and discarding those on
3 the other flank, and, as the angles had already been made consistent, it did not

matter which flank was employed. After the final values of the angles on the
adopted flank had been obtained by the simultaneous solution, those for the discarded
angles could be readily obtained, figure by figure, and thus the whole triangulation
would be finally adjusted. It is here desirable to observe that the numerous astronomical determinations of
azimuth, latitude, and differential longitude which have been made at various stations
of the Survey, furnish a number of external and independent facts of observation with
which the triangulation might have been brought into accordance. The azimuths
more particularly seemed to have a claim for introduction, as they were measured

of this Survey cannot be forced into accordance with any astronomically determinec
facts of observation without a liability to introduce errors, arising from deflections of
the plumb-line in astronomical observations, which far exceed the errors ordinarily _
generated in the triangulation.
