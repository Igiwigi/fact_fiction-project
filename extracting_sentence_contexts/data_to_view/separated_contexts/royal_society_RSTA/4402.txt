All studies of water budgeting however agree that in order to reproduce the
observed filling rates, the known subglacial lakes require water from a substantial portion of
their catchments. Therefore, the filling of active lakes appears to confirm that water is transported
from regions of net production to areas where either water is collected in subglacial lakes
downstream of the catchment or basal thermal conditions favour removal of water by basal
freeze-on. Despite the fact that the filling rates of lakes in the downstream portions of major ice streams
confirm the delivery of water from upstream as predicted in [45], many active lakes are located
in places where velocity differencing [46] and/or GPS measurements [47-49] indicate long-term
slowdown, as can be seen in figure 3. Understanding this apparent paradox, i.e. that the presence
of subglacial water does not necessarily mean that glaciers slide faster across their bed, especially
given observations of temporary acceleration during lake drainage events [11], requires a model
for the process by which they drain. The classic model for the drainage of ice dammed lakes in temperate environments favours
drainage via a tunnel thermally eroded into an R-channel [14].
