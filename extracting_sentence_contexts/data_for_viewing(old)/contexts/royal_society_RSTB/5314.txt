the lymphatic system.

A recognisable lymphatic system is first to be found in the more primitive orders of
Fishes. In them (e.g., Cyclostomes, Elasmobranchs) its specialisation, is, however, still
very imperfect, for its constituent vessels carry, from the periphery to the veins, blood
in variable quantity, or sometimes lymph and sometimes blood ; it is thus difficult in
these lower Fishes to draw any hard and fast line between lymphatics and veins. In
Ganoids the distinction is somewhat more pronounced, and in Teleosteans a separate
lymph system is definitely established, with vessels corresponding topographically with
the main pseudolymphatic trunks of Elasmobranchs, but typically lymphatic in structure
and contents.

The facts of comparative anatomy, as may be seen from the work of ALLEN (‘Anat.
Record,’ vol. 2, 1908, p. 65, etc.), Favaro, Couz and others, suggest strongly that the
lymphatic system took its origin in lower Fishes by modification of vessels that at
first appearance formed a part of the blood-vascular system, and only later in more
highly organised forms became definitely set aside for the carriage of lymph alone.
This conclusion is, in fact, that come to by most who have studied the vascular system
in the adult.

An assumed close relationship between the lymphatic system in the early stages of its
evolution and the blood-vascular system rests, however, not only on the findings of
comparative anatomists, but is to some extent suggested by the facts of embryology.
It is, of course, notorious that embryologists differ profoundly in their interpretation. of
the appearances presented by the lymphatic vessels at their first differentiation, and
