of remark, that as the fibres continue to increase in length, and the remaining nuclei
are till further separated, they are extended longitudinally and the granules become
more scattered. It sometimes happens that an irregularity may be observed in the
separation of the nuclei. Here and there two or more occasionally remain in con-
tact, as if adherent.

This lengthening of the fibre, and consequent separation of the nuclei, is due to an
increase of material, and not to a stretching of the fibreÂ®, for the lateral bands,
although they grow firmer, do not decrease in width as they approach each other;
they preserve their 8ize. Occasionally, indeed, they appear a little narrower, as if
stretched, but this is rare, and is no doubt due to manipulation.

The fact is, as these lateral bands fall in and coalesce, their breadth undergoes no
apparent alteration, They remain separated for a time at those parts of the fibre where
the nuclei are, but they ultimately join, and the nuclei lie imbedded between them.

The changes described above are generally most obviously marked, and are there-
fore more readily traced in those fibres which are formed at the earliest period. In
those of later growth, the lengthening of the fibres does not commence $0 early, or
proceed $80 rapidly, and is therefore not s0 obvious, for the nuclei usually decay be-
fore they are separated to any extent. Indeed, in some of the fibres this separation
of the majority of the nuclei seems scarcely to occur at all ; while but a small inter-
val exists between them, and while their oval form is still preserved, most of them
perish in their places, with their long axis still lying transversely; and the position
they occupied is marked for a time by clusters of granules extended transversely at
