This organ does not appear
to be endowed with any selective power over the principles or elements of which the
fluid is composed. It conveys externally the entire body of the nutritive fluid, leaving
behind only the corpuseles. This is a fact which is capable of being brought in a direct
manner before the mind and under the eye of the physiologiat. Around it there crowd
many suggestions. It proves that in this comparatively exalted clags of animale, the
process of secretion, in one case at least, is accomplished by a mechanism comparatively
rude, viz. by the direct, unchanged siphonic discharge (outwardly) of the body of the
nutritional fluid. 7

The segmental organs in Nais cannot convey externally either the normal corpuscles
of the chylaqueous fluid, or the spermatic products; these bodies are by many times too
large to traverse the bores of the tubes. [But in this genus neither the ova nor the SPer-
matozoa are at any time found in the general cavity.] They cannot convey a current of
water from without to within, from the exterior into the perigastric chamber.
