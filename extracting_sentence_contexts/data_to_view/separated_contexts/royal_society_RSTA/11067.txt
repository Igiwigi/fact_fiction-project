The upper sore over the whole segment is however unity, and the lower
integral is zero. The alternative definition of upper (lower) integration, given in §11, shows that
when the two component sets consist of parts of 8 obtained by means of segments,
the sum of the upper (lower) integrals over the two components is the upper (lower)
integral over the whole fundamental set. Theorem 16.—More generally, the sum of the upper (lower) integrals over any
Jinite or countably infinite nwmber of non-overlapping components of 8 obtained by
means of segments (e, e’), is the same as the upper (lower) integral over the whole
fundamental set, provided only the content of the components is equal to that of the
fundamental set. ,

An upper (lower) semi-continuous function stands here again in an exceptional
position, We have, in fact, the following theorem :—

Theorem 17.—The upper (lower) integral of an upper (lower) semi-continuous
function over any fundamental set 8 is equal to the sum of its integrals over every
Jinite or countably infinite number of sets into which 8 may be divided. DR. W.
