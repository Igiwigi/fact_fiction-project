Michelle C. Langley The human ability to think about possible futures, or even entirely fictional
scenarios, has been argued to have played a critical role in human evolution
[1,2]; but when, where, and how did these abilities evolve? The archaeological
record provides the means by which to determine when these capacities first
appeared. While there has been extensive debate surrounding how to interpret
individual artefacts, assemblages and landscape-wide patterns, it nevertheless
remains clear that archaeological remnants are the most direct way to establish
facts about the evolution of the human mind [3-7]. Here we examine the current
archaeological evidence for the emergence of these capacities in pre- and early
Homo sapiens.

2. Thinking about possibilities: in the deep past

The future matters to all animals and many have evolved behavioural mechan-
isms that increase the likelihood of future survival and reproduction (such as
instincts for caching food, building nests, preparing for regular changes such
as the day-night cycle, etc.). Furthermore, through conditioning, animals can
learn about the regularities of their local environments and so form predictions
