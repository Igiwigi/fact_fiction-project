Little difficulty is to be found in tracing the homologies of the sensory
(ectoneural) system. The circumoral ring and radial nerves are found in all
echinoderms except the crinoids, where the nerve ring may be poorly developed or
entirely lacking, in which latter case the fibrillae of the radial cord innervate the
oesophagus directly. In the crinoids the apical system provides the functional
sensory system, the radial ectoneural cord being purely subsidiary, as witness the
fact that its removal does not in any way interfere with the normal functioning of the
animal. The apical system of the crinoid is not, therefore, directly comparable to
that of the asteroid where the nerve is entirely motor in function. The apical nerve
of the asteroid, which has been regarded by many authors as constituting one of the
fundamental divisions of the motor nervous system has, consequently, no homologue
among the rest of the Echinodermata.
