coexisted with the Echidna-pterygoid and the Siugerpterygoid, this view would fall
to the ground. I¢ is also interesting to note that in Echidna, secondary cartilage is
absent not only from the pterygoid but also from the dentary. It would seem, therefore,
that Echidna lacks one of the factors necessary for the formation of secondary cartilage
altogether, and the fact that in Echidna the Echidna-pterygoid is not performed in
secondary cartilage is no evidence against the view that the Echnida-pterygoid is
homologous with the pterygoid cartilage of those forms which possess it. As to the pterygoid cartilage itself, although the nature of the secondary cartilage
of which it is composed is problematical, its distribution is so universal among the
higher mammals that it cannot be dismissed as a structure of transitory importance,
I mention this because, although its preformation in secondary cartilage is surely a
mammalian innovation, I regard the element which it represents as the reptilian
pterygoid. The following table gives the forms in which the pterygoid cartilage has

been found :—
