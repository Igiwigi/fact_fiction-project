On the other hand,
archaeological evidence suggested a long protracted arrival
of domesticated forms of cereal crops, with a hitherto unap-
preciated long period of pre-domestication cultivation that
stretched thousands of years back into the Pleistocene
[33,34], and a slow subsequent fixation of traits over a period
of thousands of years [35]. Increasingly, computational models are being applied to
phylogeographic data to assess alternative domestication history
hypotheses. Modelling has revealed that the genetic inferences
were based on analysis of data with low discriminatory power,
and in fact, genetic data diversity is compatible with the notion
of a protracted origin [30]. More precise estimates of the strength
of domestication syndrome traits directly from the archaeologi-
cal record have led to the further unexpected conclusion that
the selection coefficients involved are low (in the order of
0.008) for traits as divergent as shattering, largely under mono-
genic control and increased seed size, under polygenic control
[36]. This level of selection is more akin to natural selection


than the popular perception of artificial selection.
