It will be observed that the numbers in column 16, representing the work eyolyed
ont of each unit of heat, increase with the temperature and pressure of the air in the
receiver. In every example given, with the exception of the first, the economical
value of the air-engine in question is greater than that of the steam-engine calculated
by Mr. RaxkixE in his paper on the Mechanical Action of Heat. In considering
the relative merits of the engines, we must not, however, lose 8ight of a most im-
portant fact discovered by RaxkxixNg and CLavus1vs, viz. that a portion of the heat
