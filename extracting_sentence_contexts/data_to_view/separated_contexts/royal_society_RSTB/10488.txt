Evidence for the sliding
modification threshold was eventually obtained in multiple brain regions beyond
the visual system [7-13]. Learning and plasticity theories incorporated the BCM model and sliding
modification threshold partly to provide a mechanism for stabilization of
synaptic strength. In fact, biologists have long reflected upon the stability
issue and studied it in biological systems beyond the nervous system, because
