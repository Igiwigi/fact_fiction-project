These changes in gravity occur within distances which are certainly not greater than
100 km. and probably considerably less. Their cause must therefore be near the upper
surface of the crust. Assuming that the inhomogeneity arises from a complex structure in
which rocks of different density are present, an idea of the order of magnitude can be
obtained from the fact that two semi-infinite horizontal layers of rock 3 km. thick separated
by a vertical interface and differing in density by 0-2, would give a gravitational field at a
level 5 km. above their upper surface, having a maximum gradient of 1 mgal/km. directly
over the interface and an overall difference of 25 mgals. A structure in which blocks of _
granite a few kilometres thick were embedded in a matrix of basalt would therefore account |
for the observed scatter in the gravity anomalies. Alternatively, large variations in thickness
of the deep-sea sediments as suggested in §§ 4-1 and 4-33 would produce a similar effect.
