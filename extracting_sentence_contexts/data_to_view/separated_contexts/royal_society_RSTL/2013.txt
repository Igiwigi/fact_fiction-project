In order to determine the general conrse of
the tide-wave, it would be proper to make observations at points similarly
Situated ; for instance, at all the principal promontories, or in the parts of the
bays nearest the open sea. It would also be proper to attend to the course of the flood and ebb m"â€” |
$0 as to determine from what quarter the tide comes according to the common
notions on the subject. It is to be recollected, that this is not necessarily the
quarter from which the tide-wave comes ; but a knowledge of one fact may be
of service in determining the other. In channels where the stream of flood
and ebb run alternately in opposite directions, it is highly important that the
time of slack water, as well as of high and low water, should be noted. The publication of tide observations, as originally made, may be of the same
use as the same proceeding in other departments of astronomy.
