different quarter. The inquiry will therefore commence with relating the last of the
unsuccessful experiments,

Experiment 1.â€”Rabbit, six weeks old. (a). One electrode inserted into the vena
porta, the other into the vena cava, at the entrance of the hepatic veins ; no effect.
(b). Caput coli, and a yein coming from the same part ; a slight effect appeared: the
electrodes were cleaned and reinserted, but the same effect did not occur. (c). Stomach
and liver. (d). Stomach and vena porta. (e). Stomach and gall-bladder ; no effect.

In these and the following experiments the electrodes were cleaned after the for-
mation of a previous circuit, whenever the substances adhering to them might
influence the result, Repeating the experiments of Mavrevcer and of Doxxs, only
once did the effect occur, and that but slight, in the guinea-pig. The following fact
may perhaps account for it.

Instead of the plates dipping into the mercury, the points were used for this pur-

pose, and the surface of the plates served to form the free extremities of the electrodes.

'The stomach was laid open, one of the plates pressed on the mucous membrane, the
other upon the surface of the liver; a decided effect was now produced upon the
needle, and by making and breaking contact s0 as to catch the vibrations of the
