Part I. (i) consists of general considerations upon the nature of the problem and
the method of procedure. Part I. (ii) contains a short explanation of the symbols
used, Part II. is devoted to the consideration of three concepts, which embody the
ordinary prevailing ideas upon the subject and slight variants from them. The
present investigation has, as a matter of fact, grown out of the Theory of Interpoints,
which is presented in Part III. (ii), and of the Theory of Dimensions of Part IV. (i). These contain two separate answers to the question: How can a point be defined in
terms of lines? The well-known definition* of the projective point, as a bundle of
lines, assumes the descriptive point.
