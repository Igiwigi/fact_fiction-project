oil-pyroxelene and paraffin, and cut cranio-caudally by H. Barker into a complete
and really very fine series of sections at 8 », the sectional plane being almost exactly
transverse to the long axis of the embryo. The state of preservation of the latter proved
to be by no means perfect cytologically, but is sufficiently good to justify us in giving
a fairly detailed account of its structural condition. The most obvious fixation-defect
is the partial disintegration of the most cranial portion of the shield-ectoderm, the

granular detritus resulting therefrom lying partly in the amniotic cavity and partly
below the ectoderm, in a space enclosed between the latter and the detached basement
membrane. The fact that the cranial region of the early embryo is the first part to
undergo dissolution seems to be well recognised. Inspection of fig. 3, Plate 29, will
show that the embryo no longer occupies its normal position in relation to the chorion,
but has been displaced in the ventral direction. Fortunately the deformation accom-
panying this displacement has affected only the most caudal part of the embryo and
the connecting stalk, and is not of a serious character.

The following measurements were made whilst the embryo was still in oil of cedar-
wood, but must be regarded as approximate only. The lettering refers to text-fig. 2 :—
