observed.
S On the whole, therefore, we have seen that the cross-fertilisations made in the
Sspring were fairly successful. Those made in November were more or less a failure,
Band those made in December absolutely so. No data were obtained during the

ia Crosses with Echinocardium.

S In the Gulf of Naples two forms of Echinocardium are commonly met with, viz.,
E. cordatum and E. mediterraneum. These two forms are considered by A. AGassizt
Ato be distinct species, but other observers seem inclined to regard them merely as

varieties. The present experiments, so far as they go, appear to favour the view of
specific difference.

Even the pure Echinocardium larve were as a, rule obtained in but small
