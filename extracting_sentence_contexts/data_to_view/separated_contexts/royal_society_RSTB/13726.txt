With recom-
bination, however, TEs can infect new lineages without risk
of immediately killing the host, irrespective of the level of
genome streamlining. Although subsequent transposition
may still render the host inviable, the host cannot prevent a
TE from infecting its genome, thus allowing the TE to repli-
cate at least once. The fact that genome streamlining does
not occur in these sexual populations suggests that streamlin-
ing in asexual populations evolves to prevent transposition
between genomes, and not transposition within genomes.

3. Discussion

Here, we have presented an in silico coevolutionary model of
TEs and host genomes. The model reveals an interesting
interplay between genome streamlining (the amount of
