RESIN CANALS IN THE CANADIAN SPRUCE (PICEA CANADENSIS). 91

to the left. Ata higher level (Photo. 37) the resin canals are seen to be more definitely
arranged and associated with the ring, which begins to appear double, these features
increasing farther wp, as may be seen by the succeeding Photos. 38 and 39. Photo. 37
comes from just below No. 11, and shows the branch that comes off at this level,
while Photo. 39 is from the region just above No. 11. These photographs indicate that
the resin canals also become gradually grouped into two series, and that these are associated
with the two rings. In fact, the two series become so distinct, both in tangential and
radial position (Photo. 38), that one suspects that they have different causes. The inner
one is more traumatic in appearance and the reason is apparent a few sections farther on.
Photo. 39 shows a branch (No. 1) just above the region where the series was most dense
in Photo. 38. The pith of this branch does not extend any farther than is shown in Photo.
40, which is at a higher magnification to illustrate the details, i.Â¢., just to the level of the
inner series of canals, as the extent of its black pith indicates. It was broken off here,
and has been so completely covered by filling-in tissue that there is scarcely any evidence
of a disturbance of the tissues beyond this year. In fact, the filling-in tissue becomes
fairly normal in appearance in the later-formed wood of its own year. The condition
here may be contrasted with that in the normal branch shown in Photo. 37. Here, in
following the series of sections, which are in upward sequence, the pith of the branch
gets larger as it progresses farther and farther from that of the main stem, the figure
