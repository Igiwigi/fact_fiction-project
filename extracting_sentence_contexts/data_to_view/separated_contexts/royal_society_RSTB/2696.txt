the evening of one day and was found dead on the morning of the next. In such
cases the pancreas was only preserved, when it was clear that the animal was
only recently dead, rigor mortis not having set in, and the muscles still responding
to stimulation of the nerves. The facts that in such a case a small piece of liver
gave a normal histological picture, and that the changes in the pancreas were precisely
similar to those found in other specimens from toads similarly treated, but killed
by pithing immediately before preparation, should suffice to exclude the suspicion
of post-mortem change. Eleven toads were thus injected, and the effect was of the same kind in all cases,
though it varied somewhat in degree. This might be expected from the varying
effect of different preparations of secretin and the varying response of different
animals as seen in experiments on mammals.
