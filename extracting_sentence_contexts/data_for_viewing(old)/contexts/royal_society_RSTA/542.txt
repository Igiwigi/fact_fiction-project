From (3.1) and (3.2), we derive the expression for the electron density:

Given the a values measured with the scheme shown in figures 1 and 2, knowledge of the
collision frequency ven, as follows from (3.3), is needed to determine the electron density ne. In the
experiments on investigating combustible gas mixtures, this poses great difficulties resulting
from the fact that the chemical reactions (including branching chain reactions) continuously
