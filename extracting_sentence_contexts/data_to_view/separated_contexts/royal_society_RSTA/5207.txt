When @ exceeds the critical
value corresponding to curve 3 (ar = 0.54), the soliton decays under the action of heavy losses
(figure 1g). The drift and swing of solitons arise as a consequence of the gradient force induced by the
spatially inhomogeneous loss. In fact, the inhomogeneity of the loss breaks the gain—loss balance
of the dissipative soliton, causing the soliton to drift to an appropriate position in order to
maintain its stability. In the course of drifting, the profile of the dissipative soliton keeps changing
owing to the combined effects of the gain and loss, and of the diffraction and self-focusing

Figure 1. (a) The inhomogeneous loss-modulation profile, L(x) = d sin(x/5). (b) Soliton dynamics described by the relation of
the linear-loss coefficient, a, to the amplitude, d, of the inhomogeneous loss structure.The so represented dynamical regimes
include spreading out under the action of the excess gain (below curve 1), leftward drift (between curves 1 and 2), persistent
swing (on curve 2), damped oscillations (between curves 2 and 3), and decay (above curve 3). Examples of the simulated
evolution of the solitons: (c) spreading out under the excess gain at « = 0.1 and d = 0.2; (d) the leftward drift at = 0.36
and d = 0.2; (e) persistent swing at w = 0.385 and d = 0.1; (f) damped oscillations at « = 0.45 and d = 0.2; (g) decay at
a = 0.56 and d = 0.2.
