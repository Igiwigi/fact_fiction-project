This choice was based on the fact that the hyperbolic functions ensure (2.6) at the boundaries
a = Py and 6 = Q,. The parameter values were calculated to be as in table 1 and shown, along
with the estimations of data points, gand yy, in figure 2. It should be noted that since Mg = 1 then
the conditions of (2.4) are satisfied while the fact that Jy, <0 ensures (2.5).
