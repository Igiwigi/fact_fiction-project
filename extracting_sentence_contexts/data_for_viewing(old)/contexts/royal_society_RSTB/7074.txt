Europe.

Many British resident birds never visit the big communal roosts, the founding of which is
such a common feature of the starling’s life, and for almost the whole year they roost each
night, often in pairs, in the nesting holes in which they rear their young season after season.
Throughout summer and into autumn it is therefore possible to distinguish many undoubted
British birds. In January the habit of nest-hole roosting becomes almost universal among

those birds which will breed in this country in the coming spring, a fact which was first
reported by Morley (1939). Without exception all of the very many birds which were
observed to occupy nesting holes in this way were of the type described as British.

As a further check on the identification of British birds, fifteen starlings were trapped in
the winter 1939-40 and separated into the two types. The birds were ringed on one leg
with an aluminium ring bearing a serial number and the inscription ‘British Museum Nat.
Hist. London’, and on the other with different coloured celluloid rings so that the individuals
could easily be recognized through field glasses. At the time of ringing six birds were
considered to be British,* and of these four were located in the following breeding season
occupying nests within about 200 yd. of the place where they were ringed. Of the remaining
nine birds which were considered to be Continental* none was seen again. During
December 1940 the four British birds were traced again. They were still found within
