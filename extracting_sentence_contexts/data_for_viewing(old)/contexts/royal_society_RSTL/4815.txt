Considering Toronto in the first instance, it is obvious from this Table that the
westerly retrogression, which is found to take place from 10 y.. to2 a.m. in the diurnal
march of the magnetic declination when the whole of the observations are retained,
is certainly chiefly, and probably entirely, occasioned by a return of the magnet from
the disturbed position to which it had been carried by the great excess of easterly
disturbances between the hours of 7 and 10 e.v.; which easterly excess rapidly dimi-
nishes after 10 y.v. When the disturbed observations are omitted, the movement of
the north end of the needle towards the east after 6 p.m. is seen to be slower, and
never reaches 80 great an easterly extreme as takes place when the disturbed obser-
vations (which it must be remembered are only of occasional occurrence) are retained
and allowed to influence the daily mean. By the separation of the disturbances of
principal magnitude in the manner described in this paper, the westerly retrogression
at the hours referred to is in fact almost eliminated, and we can scarcely doubt that
it would be entirely s0, if we possessed the means of more completely separating the
whole of the disturbances which belong to the same class and cause as the larger
ones; and that by snch separation the character of the residual diurnal variation
would be entirely changed (as it is now almost entirely changed) from a double pro-
gression having two maxima and two minima, to a single progression with one
easterly extreme at 8 Aa.m., and one westerly extreme at 1y.m. The change in the
character of the diurnal variation at Hobarton, cansed by the omission of the dis-
turbed obseryations, is similar in kind to that at Toronto, though not quite 80
strongly marked.

The change of character which thus appears to be indicated (at both stations, but
particularly at Toronto) is a very important one, as will be readily admitted by those
