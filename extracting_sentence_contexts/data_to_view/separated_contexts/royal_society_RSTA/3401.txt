This description suggests very strongly a mathematical account expressed in terms of
surface harmonies of the third degree. If we neglect the rotation of the planet, and regard it as at rest under no external
forces, we can reach no other result than that reached by JEANS, viz., that, if the
modulus of compression was once so small that a spherically symmetrical state of
aggregation would have been unstable, the state of the planet would have been one
of lateral disturbance with a hemispherical distribution of density. We should not
be in a position to account at all for the geographical facts as presented by Sonnas.

46. The Earth is a rotating globe, and it is now generally believed to be the
larger of two fragments into which a single body has been broken up; the other
fragment is the Moon. In the early history of the Earth-Moon system the two
fragments rotated, nearly as a single rigid body; the period of revolution of the
Moon was nearly the same as the period of rotation of the Earth.
