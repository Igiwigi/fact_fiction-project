The successive sharp increments of
pressure correspond with successive impacts of the wave.

dangerously large and an abnormally high maximum is reached in one or two steps. This phenomenon seems to be the transition between an explosion and a detonation. That it is difficult, in fact almost impossible, to detonate cordite has long been
recognised as one of its principal advantages. Nevertheless, signs of abnormal
explosion were visible whenever the charge was crowded together in one part of the
enclosure. A fairly typical case is shown in fig. 4, Plate 21, a similar effect being
recorded in many other cases, notably F 68, F 69, and F 70 (Tables XI., XII., XIIT.).
