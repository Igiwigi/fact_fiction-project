Besides the superficial dentary bone (d.), with its splenial aud coronoid tract, there
is only one other os8eous centre shown in this figure ; that is the first rudiment of

modifications of growth in the individual, and also with specific, and even generic
differences ; these latter are not very great, and can easily be allowed for. This skull of an embryo, almost twice as advanced as the last, looks more embryonic
than it, for the face is shorter, and the cranium s8wells up above, giving ib an almost
Simian character (Plate 8, figs. 5 and 6). The lower view (Plate 8, fig. 5) is curiously like, and yet in several things unlike,
that of the earlier embryo of the Unau (Plate 8, fig. 1).
