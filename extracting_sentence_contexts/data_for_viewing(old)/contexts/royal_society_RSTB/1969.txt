of the bud, and one sporangium was inserted on the side of the narrow attachment of
the bud to the tip of the process, The last archegonium that could be recognised
with certainty was just behind the sporangia on the process. The most probable
explanation of this specimen, the structure of which in longitudinal section is shown
in fig. 24, would appear to be that within the tip of a cylindrical process tracheides
developed, and on the summit a group of sporangia and a bud. Some of the sporangia
remain on the process, while others have been carried up by the elongation of the
insertion of the bud. Such a case may be compared with the production of two buds
on the summit of a process referred to above.

In connection with the characters of subsporangial tissue, and of the cells near the
border line between sporophytic and prothallus tissue in the case of vegetative buds,
a fact of possible cytological interest may be recorded. In a number of these cells
two nuclei were found, although no indication of a recent division was apparent.
They were sometimes close together, sometimes farther apart. Cells in this state are
seen in figs. 21 and 23. In the absence of evidence as to the further behaviour of
these nuclei it would be premature to speculate on the possible significance of their
presence.

Nephrodium dilatatum, Drsv., var. cristatum gracile.

The original specimen of this variety of Nephrodiwm dilatatum was found. wild in
Carnarvon in 1870, The spores from which the cultures were made were obtained
from a plant in the collection of Mr. Â©. T. Drusry, F.L.S, They were sown in
November, 1895, and the prothalli have been cultivated for more than two years.
