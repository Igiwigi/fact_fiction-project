Using the Euler equations, and
the continuity equation, together with the equation of state for the gas, assumed perfect,

and the adiabatic condition, we can easily find the equation which must be satisfied by the
velocity potential from which (u, v, w) can be derived. In fact, for steady motion we have

velocity disturbance is found from the expression
