resembling a Moustierian “ racloir.”

(2) Hammer-stones, of which the most remarkable is the four-sided pyramid,
drawn in figs. 25 and 26.

(3) Heavy one-sided picks, two of which, showing a most remarkable agreement in
shape, are drawn in text-figs. 27 to 34. This type can be derived from the “ eagle’s
beaks” by greatly increasing the “stern” or hinder part (grip) of the implement,
giving added weight and hand-hold, whilst at the same time the short “beak” or
pointed portion of the implement has been so fashioned as to turn its whole length
sharply to the left (assuming that the implement was held in the right hand), These
two implements are certainly the most remarkable and novel amongst Mr, Morr’s
discoveries, their importance being greatly emphasised by the fact that there are two
of them, one from Sutton and the other from Ipswich (as yet only two have been
found), showing a most extraordinary identity in, not merely general shape, but in
details of “flaking.” I shall call this type “the massive left-sided picks” or
“ sinistro-rostrate ” implements. One (deeply stained of a café-au-lait brown) is
