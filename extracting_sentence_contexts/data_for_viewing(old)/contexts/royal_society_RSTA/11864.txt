e Marsn’s test for arsenic was applied. In no case was arsenic discovered. We
und by direct experiment that the minimum amount of arsenious oxide we could
etect by our appliances was ‘02 milligram, and that by the smell of the gas only.
£he test, however, as made by the nose is just as certain as that made by the eye
‘Shen a mirror is produced ; the latter, however, is less delicate. With respect to
Precautions, we will only say that the instructions of Fresentus were carefully

lowed, and that this was not the first occasion on which we had made the test.*

2 We may conclude that if arsenic is present in the sulphur, it is only so to an extent
Be about one part i ina million, The selenium test will be observed to be more delicate
Shan the arsenic test—a fact not generally recognized—and this when the test is
rade by noting the smell of the evolved hydrogen. If a recognizable mirror be

fequired, the arsenic test is a good deal less delicate.
= A test for tellurium and selenium was made for one of us in 1888 by Dr. Hetms,
Qua sample of sulphur recovered from thiosulphate. These results were negative.
= As regards arsenic and selenium, we wish to go further, and to show that it is very
aipbobable that they could have been present even in quantities much less than we

uld have detected. The results of the enquiry will apply alike to sulphur recovered

y the Chance process and to sulphw: recovered in the laboratory from commercial
sodium thiosulphate (assuming the latter to have come from soda waste). For this
