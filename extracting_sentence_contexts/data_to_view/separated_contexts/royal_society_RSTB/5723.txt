Fig. 40, above, is the same diagram, repeated twice in skeleton. During the “ well
maximum ” we have the additional source of water in the basins, whereof the Shabra-
mant level is shown (inset). The river is falling, but the natural water-table, shown by
the small dots and based on Ferrar’s diagram, is sufficiently near the levels observed
in our pits to require but little additional seepage from the canals to account for their
height, and especially for the fact that in 1913 our wells rose above the river level. During the “ well minimum ” we seem to require much more water from the canals,
but it is evident from previous figures that such is actually available. The rise of water-
table near the canals obstructs the leakage from them, and, conversely, the lower the
underlying natural water-table the steeper the gradient from the canals, and the more
they will lose.
