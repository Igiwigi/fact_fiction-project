than in the NGOL simulation. Leenaarts et al. [143] found no mechanism to prevent extremely
low temperatures from occurring in expanding bubbles within the standard, single-fluid MHD
formulation. The Joule heating contribution coming from ambipolar diffusion provides such a
mechanism. Observations can help determine the amount and temperature of such cold plasma
in the solar chromosphere [144,145]. The details of the physical processes in the chromospheric
cold bubbles will be described in a follow-up paper.

The upper chromosphere also shows considerable differences between the three simulations.
One can appreciate that in the GOL simulations there are a greater number (compared with
NGOL) of grid points concentrated around the temperature where hydrogen ionizes in the
simulations (white circle D in figure 3b). Moreover, the number of grid points around the
temperature where helium ionizes (T ~ 10*K) is greater for GOL-OS compared with the other
simulations (circle C). In fact, GOL-OS shows several grid points with rather dense material in
the transition region (circle A) while the transition region is the least dense in NGOL (circle
B). GOL-F has the narrowest range of densities in the transition region. These discrepancies in
the GOL simulations are due to the differences in the distribution of ambipolar diffusion as a
