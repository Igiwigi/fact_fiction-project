To put it in another way—
the reactive hole in the valence 4d shell of silver gets easily shared with the valence and core states
of neighbouring elements and it also gets transferred to the core states of Ag.

4. Free (and) radical: a contagious disease

Since Ag(II) cation is a spin-1/2 species, it exhibits a free radical character just like the isoelectronic
Cu(II) or Ni(1) siblings. Thus, the (substantial) hole transfer from Ag(II) to the chemically bound
atoms in its first coordination sphere (discussed in the previous section) is in fact equivalent to
the (substantial) decrease of the free radical character at Ag(II) and its concomitant increase at
the ligands. In other terms: Ag(II) serves as a powerful ‘spin polarizer’ towards the surrounding
matter. The transfer of spin may be appreciable, as indicated by the quantum mechanical DFT
calculations for a number of solid-state systems.
