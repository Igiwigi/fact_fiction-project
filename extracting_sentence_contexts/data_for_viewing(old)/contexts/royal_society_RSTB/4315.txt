Tt will be seen that this interpretation of the statistics implies that two sets of
epidemics, each having a three-yearly period, were running contemporaneously.
With a length of period so great as three years in a disease which chiefly attacks
young children, it is obvious that, at the date at which each new outburst of disease
was due, there would be a very large susceptible population : subsidiary epidemics
would, therefore, be easily produced. This explanation, in view of the sequence of
the figures, seems to me the most probable, though, as before remarked, with a
period of 18 months the amplitude is greater than 600. The facts just described
throw considerable light upon the interpretation which must be put upon the

statistics of London. It is quite obvious that no period found in London need be
rejected because of its duration. It is also proved by several undoubted instances
that no periodicity has any elements of absolute permanency. The changes observed
in London are therefore no more than might be expected from the evidence obtained
from other districts. Even the results of the investigation of the first epoch,
doubtful though they are, may contain a very large percentage of truth.
