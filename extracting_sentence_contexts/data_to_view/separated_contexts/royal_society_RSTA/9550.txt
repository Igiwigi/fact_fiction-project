They are given in the table above, where the agreement with the law is
evident. PASCHEN also suggests another set for m = 2, in which the separations are
still more out of order, viz. :

He supports this with a considerable list of combination terms, which, though
striking, do not prove that the lines in question belong to the direct P series. In
fact, there is evidence that some of these combinations are related to the D series. Further, I hope to show, in the next part, that his P, (2) here is a collateral of the
singlet P series discovered by him and published in the same paper, A comparative
list of the lines is given in Appendix IT. A similar rule is seen to hold (as was indeed known from the results of Part I.) in
the case of the alkalies, except that here the difference of the P, and P, is the same
for all orders.
