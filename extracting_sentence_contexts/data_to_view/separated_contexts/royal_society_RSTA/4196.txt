(3.) It is noteworthy that the isothermal curves for 50° C. and 100° C. give clear
indications that at these temperatures liquid (over-cooled) sodium hydroxide would
possess a very considerable conductivity. The power to conduct in the fused state is
necessary, in order to explain the form of the two isothermal curves referred to, and
the fact that this effect can already be detected in solutions containing less than 50 per
cent. NaOH affords very strong confirmatory evidence of the view arrived at from the
study of the intrinsic conductivity in Part VI. of the paper, that in concentrated
aqueous solutions the conductivity of sodium hydroxide is to a large extent indepen-
dent of the ionising power of the solvent, and depends on the self-ionising properties
of the liquid alkali.
