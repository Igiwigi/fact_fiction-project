Most authors
(BroxGvlanrt, ZeExKER, BRONN, and Hookes) consider them to be fruits, while UnGzs
(Sylloge, p. 18) declared recently that they must be seeds, referring to the seeds
of coniferous trees: as snch I considered them formerly, when I described them
(though granting the doubts concerning their character) as Pinus rhabdosperma. In all
those specimens which I had then seen, the peculiar constricted yolya was not distinct ;
but it is also wanting in all the seeds of conifers which I knoyy, as is also the prominent
edge and the sculpture. More probably they are comparable with the seeds of Samyda,
which have such a volya, and which agree besides pretty well in respect to their form ;
but then we must bear in mind that the organs in question are ligneous, that they are
dehiscent by a longitudinal fissure, and that such facts are much against an interpreta-
tion as seeds, though in favour of the hypothesis that they might haye had the organiza-
tion of a fruit. G

Hooker 8upposed them to be cryptogamic fruits, although he was not able to point
ont an analogy amongst the cryptogamic plants. He maintains this view by stating
that in the interior of the fruit a delicate ac is frequently found, which he considers
to be a sporangium.
