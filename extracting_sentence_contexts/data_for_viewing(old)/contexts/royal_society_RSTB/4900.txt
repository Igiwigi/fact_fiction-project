BASED ON THE CONCLUSIONS OF DR. J. ©. WILLIS, F.R.S. 25

as to their extreme rarity are correct I do not think we are at all likely in any near future
to obtain direct information as to their nature. The whole scheme has therefore, I
think justifiably, been simplified to the greatest possible extent to enable us to get a
first notion, in quantitative terms, of the possible consequences of the conceptions, and
to compare them as far as possible with the facts.

I will now endeavour to summarise the conclusions reached in general terms which
I hope may be comprehensible to the non-mathematical biologist. The conclusions
result, of course, from the assumptions, and simply exhibit their consequences. In
_ so far as the deductions do not agree with the known facts, the assumptions are probably
incorrect or incomplete. Ini so far as we find agreement, or the more nearly we find
agreement, the assumptions are probably correct. It is only by a full development of
the consequences that an effective test of the assumptions can be made.

In Section I the question is considered, what is the average law of increase of the
number of species within the genus. Within any single genus, starting at zero time
from one primordial species, the increase in the number of species will, of course, proceed
with complete irregularity, the occurrence of specific mutations being assumed a matter
of chance. But if we suppose some large number N of primordial species, each belonging
to a different genus but similar in so far that we can take-the chance of a specific mutation
occurring as the same for all (¢f. above, p. 23), to start together at zero time, we can
then ask what is the average law of increase. The answer obtained is that, on an average,
