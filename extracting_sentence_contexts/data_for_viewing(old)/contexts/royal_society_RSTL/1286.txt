and terminating at last in' forming the four recti museles
belonging to the eye, so that, upon the contraction of these

muscles, motion of the scales would be produced. This im- . *

bricated appearance of part of the sclerotica, and the detection
of th- tendinous fibres. spreading oyer scales terminating at
lasr in the four recti muscles, led me to consider the use of
this structure, what would be the effect of motion of the
scales upon the vision of birds, and how far this can be ap-
plied to other animals.

It is a fact 80: well known to persons acquainted with op-
tics that it is almost unnecessary to mention it, that the rays
of light, passing through a lens, will be refracted to a point or
focus beyond the lens, and this focus will be less distant in
proportion as the lens approaches to a sphere in shape. Now
this principle is very naturally applied to the explanation of the
use of this apparatus. These scales lying each partly over the
next, $0 as to allow of motion, will, on the contraction of
the recti muscles inserted into, and covering them, move over
each other, and thus the circle of the sclerotica will be dimi-
nished, and of course the cornea, which is immediately within
the circle made by these scales, will be pressed forwards, or in:
other words rendered more convex, and thus the focus of the
