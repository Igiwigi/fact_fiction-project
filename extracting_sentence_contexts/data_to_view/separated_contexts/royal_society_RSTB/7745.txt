In wild-type neuroblasts, Pins is necessary to localize DaPKC to the
apical cortex. Basally active Lgl functions to inhibit basal localization of DaPKC and, thus, restrict its function to the apical side
for neuroblast self-renewal. In pins /gl double mutants, DaPKC is delocalized and inherited by both daughter cells, and thus
neuroblasts undergo continuous symmetric self-renewing divisions (adapted from Lee er al. 2006a).
