The effect of elastic waves in the
surroundings of the shield is usually not explored due to the lack of simplified homogenized
models allowing the simulation of large meta-structures with reasonable computational costs. We show in this paper that, once such a model is established, suitable boundary value problems
can be set up allowing an eased simulation of both the inner and outer domain. In fact, even if
dynamic homogenization methods have provided important advancements in the modelling of
infinite-size metamaterials [32,33,35â€”40], little is known about handling scattering problems at the
boundaries of finite-size metamaterials. This lack of knowledge is mainly due to the difficulties
arising in establishing pertinent macroscopic boundary conditions formally upscaled from
microscopic ones. To overcome this problem, we propose here to study the scattering properties of
the considered shielding device via the relaxed micromorphic model, introduced by the authors
[41-43] and recently equipped with a set of well-posed, physically coherent boundary conditions
[7].
