In 1968 and 1970 he published two papers that effectively contained
descriptions of the TN display (Arora et al. 1968; Fergason et al. 1970). He
made no attempt then to patent the concept, and was surprised, and probably
irritated, when a colleague reported back after a visit to H-LR that Schadt and
Helfrich had invented a new form of LCD. In fact, it was as a result of this
inadvertent disclosure that H-LR had rapidly taken the patenting and publishing
actions. Fergason himself set about composing patents and, after an abortive
attempt in February, submitted in April a patent, which was granted in 1973
(Fergason 1971). No mention was made in this patent of his earlier publications.
