As Racah points out, the elements can
be factorized into a purely orbital and purely charge-spin component, and it is possible to
choose these components so that they depend only on the representation symbols of the

appropriate special unitary groups; they are further invariant with respect to a change to
the contragredient representation with the possible exception of a change of sign when one
starred state of a self-contragredient representation is involved. In going from corresponding
states of the p" configuration to those of the p!?-” configuration, which belong to contra-
gredient representations, there is, in fact, with the Jahn & van Wieringen standard
(amended) phases only one matrix element which changes sign; this is the element

(p*[211] (210) (10) 38P | X | p*[31] (101) (21) SP)
(p®[332] (012) (01) 3P| X | p§[431] (101) (42) SBP)
2. (47)

All other matrix elements are the same for corresponding states of the p” and /'*~" con-
figurations. The matrix elements of V were derived in the following manner (following Hope 1950). We may write the wave functions for the nuclear /" configuration in the form
