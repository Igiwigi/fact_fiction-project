oun, they give the oun as 362°01 and 361°80 in place of 361°94 of Table I., but the
multiples are too large to found any conclusions upon. It would rather seem that
there is some displacement from a typical multiple. Using A as given in Table L.,
viz., 37684, 22A = 829048. So that D,, = 22A—7455 and 7455 = 163-177. If it
is 22A — 160 exactly, A becomes 8°04 less and the oun 361°871w" in place of
361°947. The value of D,,+160 is therefore inserted. If the typical term were 16d
higher, the order ditferences would run 726, 62d, 50d, 50d, in place of 580, 620, &c.,
and hence more in line with others.

Tl Neither the observed nor the supposed collaterals are multiples of A. They
are expressed as multiples of 3. Although they are large multiples, their values are
quite definite provided we know @ priori that the denominators are multiples as
a fact. If the multiple be altered by unity, the resultant quotient cannot come
within the limiting values of the oun.

If the normal D,, (2) = 7A = 939078, the order difference over D,, (3) would be
939078—888643 (89) = 50435489, and 3343 = 134d, = 50495, so that the order
difference would come out as usual a close multiple of 6, All this group seem to
show the same kind of irregularity.

O. There are three separate series, see data for Table IL., differing by multiples of
A,, just as in the order differences. A, is too small to test the multiples of the
denominators themselves. i

S. The D(2), D(3) lines for S and Se are beyond observed regions. Sulphur
