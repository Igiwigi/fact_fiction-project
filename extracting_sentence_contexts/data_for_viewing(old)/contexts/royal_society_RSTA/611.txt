a non-trivial experimental challenge and only a few types of thermometers have been successfully
used in this range [1,2]. The lower end of the provisional low-temperature scale PLTS 2000 [3]
is set by the Néel temperature of solid 3He, Tx = 0.902 mK, which means that thermodynamic
temperatures below this point have to be established individually at each laboratory by the use of
suitable primary thermometers. Although many properties of solids and quantum liquids depend
on temperature below 1 mK there is a clear shortage of methods that allow the determination
of temperature in primary mode. Most widely used is pulsed !*°Pt nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR), in which the spin temperature of the platinum nuclei just before the first pulse is
determined and taken as the thermodynamic temperature assuming that the Pt nuclear spins
were in thermal equilibrium with the conduction electrons. Over more than three decades, this has
proved to be a reliable method to determine ultra-low temperatures. However, one disadvantage
of this technique is the fact that considerable heat is deposited during the pulse sequence. In
recent years, efforts have been increased to establish a second technique based on thermal noise : =
for measuring ultra-low temperatures in primary mode or at least in relative primary mode. One 3
of these techniques is based on the measurement of thermal current noise originating from a
temperature-independent resistor. nee)
