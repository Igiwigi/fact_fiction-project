germarium area is small and terminal. It contains oogonia in different stages of develop-
ment. No traces of ovarioles can be detected in this ovary which looks from the outside
like a sac filled with oval-shaped eggs (figure 14). The peritoneal coat shows cellular
structure in the young fly and loses this gradually with age.

In the young fly ovary the eggs are embedded in a follicular epithelium which surrounds
and encloses them in separate follicles. The follicular epithelium forms an epithelial plug
at the base of the ovary with extensive tapering anteriorly. It would appear that this
epithelium also does not merely play the part of secreting the egg chorion, but is important
as a nourishing factor. This conclusion is supported by the fact that histolysis takes place
among the follicular cells of the basal plug. Before passing into the histolytic stage these
cells show great activity having large nuclei and clearly displayed nucleoli. The bodies of
the histolytic cells later fuse together into one mass surrounded by a layer of follicular cells
which secrete a spherical membrane around it. In one case it was found that histolysis
had occurred in more than one place and consequently more than one mass had appeared.
The most outstanding feature of the histolysis is that the resultant bodies acquire a
resemblance to cellular structure appearing as giant cells with definite outer wall and
containing a nuclear-like body (see figure 18, which shows the condition in the pupa). In the
old fly ovary all giant and follicular cells disappear, except for traces of the latter which are
scattered in the small spaces among the ova, the ova having increased in size at the expense
of the digested follicular epithelium.
