fluorine was to be sought in the neighbourhood of the figure 200, and was by no
means so low as students of the refraction equivalents have surmised.

But the most interesting point observed was the presence, in the residuals, of a
larger proportion of oxygen than could be accounted for by the amount of air present.
This was observed to be the case in all the experiments shown in Tables IT. and IIL,
as well as in others specially designed to test the point ;} and it was ultimately
proved, beyond reasonable doubt, that the oxygen was produced by the intermittent
electrolysis of traces of water in the electrolytic tube, and not by subsequent reactions.
Our experience was that the proportions of oxygen and fluorine liberated were not
sensibly altered by prolonging the experiment for two or three hours.

Having established this fact, we were enabled to make dispositions for the series of

to accuracy.
