of these structures.

'The shell-grooye is perhaps the most important structure to which I have to draw
attention in this paper, and I may therefore now say a few more words about it. Is
this groove connected with the secretion of the shell ? or is it perhaps an invagination
to give rise to a block of tisxwe connected subsequently with the rectum and anus ?
That question occurred to me; and if the former supposition could not be supported,
the apparent analogy with the shell-groove of Pisidium would be a false one ; also
the possibility that this primitive groove in Mollusca generally may represent the
closed epidermal sac, in which the pen of Loligo is developed, would haye no basis.
I am able definitely and conclusiyely to show that the © shell-groove ” in Aptysia does
really belong to the shell, and in fact sometimes contains a plug of chitinous secretion,
an imbedded hell in fact, the possible homogen of the internal pen of Cephalopoda.
The specimens which gaye this interesting result, and which also throw light on the
connexion of the rectal portion of the alimentary canal with the early aboral thick-
ening of the epiblast and the cell marked pme, are artificially produced deformities.

I was in the habit of keeping egg-coils of Aplysia minor in a basin, through which
there ran a constant current of sea-water. From the same egg-coil I cut from day to
day a small piece of the coil, in order to examine the embryos contained in its capsules.
I noticed that in ome cases which had been left for several days untouched, the bit of
the coil near the cut edge had asxumed an opaque and curiously pink appearance.
The capsules at this part on examination proyed to contain most strange and irregular-
looking embryos, which were, however, in a high state of activity, moving about by
means of their cilia, as though their distorted conformation made little difference to
