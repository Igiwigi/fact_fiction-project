Asa rule the scales are slightly convex, and closely resemble the pilgrimâ€™s
scallop shell. Plate 2, fig. 15) shows a section mounted in glycerol made through the root of
one of the same scales. At this point many of the scales are almost mushroom
shaped, owing to the fact that the root, b, instead of being at the base of the scale,
is affixed some way towards the middle. The relation of the striation to the
colour has been discussed (p. 12), and reasons have been given for the belief that the
colour, though it may be associated with diffraction, is produced partly by inter-
ference.

from the wings and other portions of certain Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, Odonata, ete.
