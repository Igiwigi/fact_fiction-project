lost their independent vitality. It is, of course, open to any one to maintain that the
cells which lose all trace of their nucleus and become irregular, highly refracting
masses of indefinite outline are yet capable of resuming their original properties as
protoplasmic corpuscles, and that they are not really degenerated, but only temporarily
modified. Cells or corpuscles which subsequently appear and take part in the for-
mation of the tisses may then be ascribed to the retention of individuality and
protoplasmie properties by the cells proliferated from the inner capsular membrane. I
believe, however, that corpuscles which have undergone the changes above described
and indicated in the Plates (Plate 12. figs. 23 & 24) will be considered by most persons,
as by myself, to haye passed irretrievably from the living condition to that of a meta-
morphic product. Strangely enough, however, as though to prevent our feeling any
assurance that the suryival of such cells in an egg-mixture is rendered quite improbable
by the facts obseryed in Sepia and Zoligo, we find, both in the fully formed and the
immature ovarian eggs of Sepia, here and there scattered in the yelk, nucleated cells,

which are undoubtedly exceptional individuals of the migrated capsular cells which have
not become fully metamorphosed. TI have never obseryed more than fifteen of these in
one egg, and those widely scattered, and all of those did not possess nuclei (Plate 12.
fig. 25, also 24 & 26). They were observed only in Sepia, not in Loligo, and lying at
a depth in the yelk, apparently in a zone of less dense yelk than that of the surface.
