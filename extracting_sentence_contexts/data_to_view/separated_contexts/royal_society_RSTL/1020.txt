During a cruise which I made as a volunteer in the Victory,
with the British fleet, under the command of my late worthy
friend Sir CHARLEs HaRDy, in the year 1779, I had many op-
portunities of attending to the firing of heavy cannon : for
though we were not fortunate enough to come to a general
action with the enemy, as is well known, yet, as the men
were frequently exercised at the great guns, and in firing at
marks, and as some of my friends in the fleet, then captains,
(since made admirals) as the Honourable Keirn STEWART,
who commanded the Berwick of 74 guns—Sir CHARLES
DoveLas, who commanded the Duke of 98 guns—and Ad-
miral MacBR1DE, who was then captain of the Bienfaisant of
64, guns, were kind enough, at my request, to make a number
of experiments, and particularly by firing a greater number of
bullets at once from their heavy guns than ever had been
done before, and observing the distances at which they fell in
the sea; I had opportunities of making several very interest-
ing observations, which gave me much new light relative to
the action of fired gunpowder. And afterwards, when I went
out to America, to command a regiment of cavalry which I had
raised inthat country for the King's service, his Majesty having
been graciously pleased to permit me to take out with me
from England four pieces of light artillery, constructed under
the direction of the late Lieutenant General DesaGUL1ERs, with
a large proportion of ammunition, I made a great number of
interesting experiments with these guns, and also with the

236 Count RumrorD's Experiments to determine

Ship guns on board the ships of war in which I made my pas-
sage to and from America,

It would take up too much time, and draw out this paper
to too great a length, to give an account in detail of all these
experiments, and of the various observations I have had oppor-
tunities of making from time to time, relative to this subject. I shall, therefore, only observe at present, that the result of all
my inquiries tended to confirm me more and more in the
opinion, that the theory generally adopted relative to the ex-
plosion. of gunpowder was extremely erroneous, and that its
force is in fact much greater than is generally imagined. That
the position of Mr. Ropins, which supposes the inflammation
and combustion of gunpowder to be s0- instantaneous « that
« the whole of the charge of a piece of ordnance is actually
« inflamed and converted into an elastic vapour before the
* bullet is sensibly moved from its place,” is very far from
being true; and that the ratio of the elasticity of the generated
fluid, to its density, or to the space it occupies as it expands,
is very different from that as8umed by Mr.
