A. Geological Position.â€”In this most remarkable thermal site, reported to be the
most prolific in Europe, we are not disappointed in finding a complete confirmation
of the general principle that hot springs take their rise at the boundary of granite. Ax
is seated on the river Arriege, several leagues above Ussat. We pass from limestone
to slate, and from slate to granite, exactly at Ax. This granite immediately rises
into lofty mountain masses, forming a sort of nucleus or centre of elevation, com-
prehending the sterile country between Ax and Mont Louis. It is here that in all
the extent of the Pyrenees, reckoning from the Atlantic, the granite first constitutes
the ridge or geographical azis of the chain, though it invariably forms (where visible)
the geological axis. From this group of granitic mountains the country slopes in
three directions, to the east, north, and south. It may, in fact, be viewed as the true
termination of the ridge, which gradually descends by subdivided ramifications to
the Mediterranean, the chain being split by the valleys of the Tet and Tech running
east and west, which are not to be viewed as longitudinal valleys, but as valleys ra-
diating from this the most easterly centre of elevation, just as the transverse valley
of the Arridge radiates to the north, and that of the Segre to the south-west. It is
important to keep this in view in examining the magnificent circuit of hot springs
which surrounds this granitic nucleus. The system of the Canigou, though perhaps

* In the name Ax we trace the word Aqua, as we also do in the appellation of a multitude of points cele-
brated for hot springs in France and the Pyrenees; as Aix, Chaudesaigues, Caldegas, Escaldas,
