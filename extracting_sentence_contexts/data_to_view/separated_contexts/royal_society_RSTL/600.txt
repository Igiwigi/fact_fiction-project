From the result of the experiment of which an account has
Just been given, it is evident, that we should be just as much
affected by the calorific rays emitted by a cannon bullet at the
temperature of 160 degrees of FAYRENHE1T's scale, (=64, degrees
above that of the blood,) as by the frigorific rays of an equal
bullet, ice cold, placed at the same distance ; and that a bullet
at the temperature of freezing mercury, could not affect us much
more sensibly, by its frigorific rays, than an equal bullet at the
temperature of boiling water would do, by its calorific rays; but,
at these comparatively'small intervals of temperature, the radia-
tions of bodies are hardly sensible, and could never have been
perceived, much less compared and estimated, without the assis-
tance of instruments much more delicate than our organs. of
feeling. ' Hence we see how it happened, that the frigorific ra-
diations of cold bodies remained 80 long unknown. They were
suspected by Bacox; but their existence was first ascertained

124 Count RuMFoRD's Enquiry concerning the Nature of Heat,

by an experiment made at Florence, towards the end of the
seventeenth century. Andit is not a little curious, that the learned
academicians who made that experiment, and who made it with
a direct view to determine the fact in question, were 80 com-
pletely blinded by their prejudices respecting the nature of heat,
that they did not believe the report of their own eyes; but,
regarding the reflection and concentration of cold (which they
considered as a negative quality) as impossible, they concluded,
that the indication of such reflection and concentration, which
they observed, must necessarily have. arisen from some error
committed in making the experiment. Happily for the progress of science, the matter was. again
taken up, about twenty years ago, by Professor PicTET; and
the interesting fact, which the Florentine academicians would not
discover, was put beyond all doubt. But till, this ingenious and
enlightened philosopher did not consider the appearances of a
reflection of cold, which he observed in his experiments, as
being real ; nor was he led by them to admit the existence of
frigorific emanations from cold bodies, analogous to those calo-
rific emanations from hot bodies, which he calls radiant heat.
