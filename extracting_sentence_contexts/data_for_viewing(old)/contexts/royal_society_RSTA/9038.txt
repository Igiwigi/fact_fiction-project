The two equations (8.11) and (8.12) are sufficient to determine the precise form of
F as far as second-order derivatives, if the value of F, be substituted from equation
(5.15) in the term D/(F), on the left-hand side. On the left-hand side of these
equations there are still derivatives of the first order. If, however, we write

I(F) = 1(F,) + I(F;),

in accordance with equation (3.13), and use equation (4.10), we are able to reduce
equation (8.11) so that it contains second-order derivatives only. In fact, we find
