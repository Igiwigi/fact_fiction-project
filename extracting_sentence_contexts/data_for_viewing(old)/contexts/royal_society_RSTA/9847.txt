Firstly, with regard to the vertical distribution of temperature.

Mr. Goxn’s theory as to the reason of the decrease of temperature up to a certain
height, put briefly, is this (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ A, vol. 82, p. 43, 1908). Any layer of
air is dependent for its temperature on the four following sources of heat :—
radiation from the sun, radiation from the earth, radiation from the neighbouring layers,
and convection from below, this latter including the supply due to condensation. Its
temperature will be such that its loss of heat by out radiation will just balance these
sources of supply. Above, the isothermal convection ceases and absorption and
radiation are equal. The paper should be consulted. The numerical values are of
course somewhat doubtful, especially since the amount of aqueous vapour at different
heights is uncertain, but the whole theory seems eminently reasonable, and apart from
details explains the general fact of the isothermal region. If this theory be correct,
then air that is below the mean temperature for its own height and for the season

will be air that has recently risen and conversely, for the air changes its temperature
slowly under the influence of radiation, but instantly under the influence of change
of pressure. Also, the magnitude of the temperature departure from the mean
should be an index of the intensity of the ascending or descending motion.

For convection to occur it would seem necessary that the lower layer should be
potentially at least as warm as the air above it, that is to say, that if the lower layer
