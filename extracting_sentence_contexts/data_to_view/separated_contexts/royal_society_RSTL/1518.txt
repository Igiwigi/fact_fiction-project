These facts are generally, but in my opinion
erroneously, attributed to an immediate sympathy between
the pupils. For when the pupil of one eye becomes dilated
from the application of Belladonna, the pupil of the other, 50
far from dilating, becomes smaller. It follows, therefore, that
the size of the pupil is dependant, not only on the impression
of light on the retina of its own eye, but on that also which is
made on the retina” of the other, and that the moving of the
two together, which for the most part takes place, is only an
accidental consequence of the fact which I have mentioned. 2. As the action of the external muscles of the eye has been
ſrequently resorted to, for an explanation of its capacity to
see objects perfectly at different distances, I requested Dr.
CvurrixG toattend to this matter.
