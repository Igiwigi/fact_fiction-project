I have more than once, in previous memoirs,
suggested that the 2. aspera was the petiole of the leaf of the Lyginodendron ; and
my friend, the Count pg Sotms, of Gottenburg, who has obtained numerous examples
of these two plants from the Westphalian deposit at Pith Vollmond, has arrived
independently at the same conclusion. If we are correct in this supposition, we have
now, for the first time, in Lyginodendron Oldhamium, a Fern of which the stem or
rachis exhibits a highly developed form of exogenous growth. This fact in some
degree influences our interpretations of the two species of Heterangium, in both of
which we find in the outermost bark the remarkable horizontal bands of dense
sclerenchyma represented in Plate 22, fig. 11, of the present memoir, and in
Plate 29, fig. 32, h’, and Plate 31, figs. 45, 47, and 49 of the Memoir,
Part IV., in which Heterangium Grievii was first described. This remarkable
peculiarity in the structure of the outer cortex of these two plants has led to a
careful search for any fossil stems, with their foliage attached, in which a similar
structure seemed to exist. Some months ago Mr.
