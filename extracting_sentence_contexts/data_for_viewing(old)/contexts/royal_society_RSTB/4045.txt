practically the same size as the controls recorded in Colorado Springs before and after
our stay at the summit. In the case of Douauas the curves for July 13, 14, and 25
are noticeably smaller than his normals. The evidence obtained from the recoil curves

is thus seen to be in general agreement with that afforded by the pulse pressure method.

Both methods indicate a diminished systolic discharge in Douvauas, and no consider-
able alteration in any of the others.

Additional evidence that the systolic discharge is not considerably altered even by
prolonged residence at a high altitude is afforded by the three curves here reproduced
from Ropison, Russein, and Deviney, all three of whom live on the Peak for several
months each year. The curve from Deviney is, in fact, of somewhat less than
ordinary amplitude, which accords with the fact that the subject (a telegrapher) leads
a sedentary life and is of rather frail physique. Similar small curves were found by
YanpELL Henperson (Joc. cit.) in persons of similar constitution and habits at sea-level.

Thus this case supports the view that acclimatisation to low barometric pressures (at
least down to 450 mm.) does not per se alter the volume of the systolic discharge.

It was pointed out above that the pulse pressures obtained on FuLLER while he
was mountain-sick indicated a greatly diminished amplitude of heart beat in this
