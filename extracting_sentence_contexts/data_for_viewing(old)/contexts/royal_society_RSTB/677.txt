two phases of the variation the positive appears to be the more marked. Finally, i
the Mammalian salivary gland, there would appear to be a definite connection between
the nature of the nerve fibres stimulated and that of the electrical change.

In experiments upon excitation of the skin of the Eel it is unfortunately impossible —
to make use of indirect stimulation by cutaneous nerves. ‘This fact is occasioned by
the absence of a large subcutaneous lymph space, such as exists in the case of the
Frog and Toad, so that a ‘‘ nerve-skin preparation” is not feasible. It is, therefore,
necessary to resort to direct stimulation, which may be electrical, thermic, or
mechanical,

In the circuit represented in fig. 1, p. 338, it is evident that, by means of the switch C,
induction shocks can be applied to the skin through the leading-off electrodes, and the
current of the skin subsequently passed into the previously compensated galvano-
meter circuit.

With carefully made “non-polarisable” electrodes, and by reversals of the direction
of the stimulating current, it is possible to assure oneself of freedom from error due to
