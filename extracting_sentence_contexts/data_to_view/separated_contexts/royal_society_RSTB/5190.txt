No evidence has been obtained of a corresponding amount of pairing in
somatic divisions, where the evidence indicates that the closeness of pairing varies within
a plant and does not correspond to the paired arrangement found in diakinesis. _ The fact that the triple hybrid Oe. (biennis x rubricalyx) x ammophila has all its
chromosomes paired, makes it clear that complete pairing cannot be regarded as a sign
of the homozygous condition, as has been assumed by some previous writers. On the
other hand, it is not certain that the hybrid with seven free pairs of chromosomes
shows a greater amount of genetic segregation than the reciprocal with only three pairs
and the remainder combined into a ring. It may be held as a tentative hypothesis that
the linkage of chromosomes in Oenothera has arisen between non-homologous
chromosomes as a result of crossing.
