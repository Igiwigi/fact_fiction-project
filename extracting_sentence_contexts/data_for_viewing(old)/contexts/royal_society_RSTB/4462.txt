Curve I shows the rise of temperature on loading with a further 300 grm.
Curve II shows (a) the fall; () the rise; and (¢) the subsequent further fall of temperature on
removing the 300 grm., after it had hung on the muscle for an “ infinite” time.
Curve III shows the effect of loading with 300 grm., and then unloading again after 1 sec.
Curve IV shows the effect of loading and unloading again after 2 sees.
Curve V shows the effect of loading and unloading again after 4 secs.

By an analysis of the curves of fig. 5, taking the deflections of I and II at every 1 sec. and then
adding them together algebraically with an interval (‘‘ phase difference ”) of (@) 1 sec., (}) 2 secs., and
(c) 4 sees., it is found that as regards the initial shape of the curve—i.¢., wp to 5 or 6 secs.—there is
good agreement between the results so calculated and the observed Curves III, IV, and V respectively.
Afterwards, however, in all the later stages, much less heat is actually given out than would be
calculated from the addition of I and II with the appropriate “ phase difference”: in fact—as would
be expected—the irreversible processes leading to a loss of potential energy and the production of
heat, are much less in extent when the load is left on for a shorter time. The same thing is shown
by the fact that the total heat production in the complete cycle of loading and unloading, given very
nearly by the areas of the Curves III, IV, and V, obviously increases as the interval between loading
and unloading increases.

determined in the case of the experiments on muscles by means of a direct calibra-
tion, as described in another paper (3). It was about the same in the various
experiments on muscles and may be taken to be approximately (in the original
records)

1 mm. = 6X 10~* C, or 0:00006 calories per grm.
