A thin film of carbonaceous matter
entirely destroys the igniting power of platinum, and a slight
coating of sulphuret deprives palladium of this property,
which must principally depend upon their increasing the
power of the metals to radiate heat. Thin lamine of the metals, if their form admits of a free
circulation of air, answer as well as fine wires; and a large
surface of platinum may be made red hot in the vapour of
ether, or in a combustible mixture of coal gas and air. I need not dwell upon the connection of these facts res-
pecting slow combustion, with the other facts I have described
in the history of flame. Many theoretical views will arise
from this connection, and hints for new researches, which I

Hope to be able to pursue in another communication. I shall
now conclude by a practical application.
