The electrical resistances of the two troughs were now made equal by altering the
amount of solution in T, the depth of this solution being then taken as the value of hy. When the current passed from A to B h, was 1 -34 cm., while for C to D it was 1-14 em. The mean of these two numbers, 1-24 cm., was taken as probably corresponding most
nearly to the irregular arrangement of eggs under the hen.

hy was calculated from the fact that when the difference between the vapour pressures
inside and outside an egg is 1 mm. of mercury 2:4 = 10-* grms. of water passes on the
average through each square centimetre of shell surface per 24 hours; but the value
obtained for h, proved to be so small (0-08 cm.) that it does not seem worth while to
give the somewhat elaborate argument by which it was obtained. It thus appears that

h=h, +h, = 1-24 + 0-08 = 1°82 cm.

in a nest for which, when filled with eggs, the distance between the two surfaces is
4} cm. Distribution of Humidity in Nest.—To obtain the only other unknown quantity,
3, —8,, in equation (1) it was necessary to compare the mean
humidity round the edge of the nest with that at the centre.
