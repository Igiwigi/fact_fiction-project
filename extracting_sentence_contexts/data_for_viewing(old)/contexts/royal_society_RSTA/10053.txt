other. In the first series of measurements: Mean E.M.F. of English cells—Mean
E.M.F. of American cells =+0:000006 volt, and in the second series of measure-
ments the difference is +0°000009 volt. Two cells which Mr. Rayner of the
National Physical Laboratory kindly took from Teddington to the Reichsanstalt, in
September, show equally good agreement.

The German cells mentioned in Table IX. (the series are designated by P, O,
and M) were prepared in March, 1907, with three different samples of mercurous
sulphate made by the von Steinwehr precipitation method. During the first few
months after their preparation these cells showed on the average a decrease in E.M.F.
of about 1 part in 10,000, and the E.M.F. had not. attained a state of constancy at
the commencement of the measurements in question. Drs. JAnGER and LinpEcK
suggest that the cause of this alteration lies in the fact that the three samples of
mercurous sulphate were washed out with dilute sulphuric acid in course of prepara-
tion. The relative agreement in the individual groups is, however, very good. In
the P group there are eight cells and the difference between any one cell and the
mean has at no time exceeded 2 parts in 100,000; in the O group there are six cells,
and in the M group six cells, and the corresponding differences for these groups are
about 1 and 1'7 parts in 100,000, respectively. Intercomparisons were made with
the older cells (1899) of the Reichsanstalt, which were taken as constant during the
period June 20 to September 30, 1907.
