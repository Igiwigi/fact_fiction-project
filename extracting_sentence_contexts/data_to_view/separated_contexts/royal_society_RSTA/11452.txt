The actual differences between the classes are likely to be somewhat greater than
these numbers would imply, both as a result of the whole of the light of the lines not
being shown through under-exposure, and also of the fact that the small but constant
time during which the electrical discharge occurs and all the lines glow equally is
included in them. Tn connection with this evidence it must be observed that the greater duration
of lines is not combined with a greater intrinsic brightness at the beginning of the
discharge ; on the contrary, the intrinsic brightness of the are lines at the beginning
of the discharge is usually much less than that of the spark lines, although, since
their light dies away at a slower rate, they may exceed the latter in brilliancy in the
photograph of the stationary spark. The difference between the classes is in reality
one of the magnitude of the logarithmic decrement of the atomic vibrations corre-
sponding to the lines, the are lines having a small, and the condensed spark lines a
very great, decrement.
