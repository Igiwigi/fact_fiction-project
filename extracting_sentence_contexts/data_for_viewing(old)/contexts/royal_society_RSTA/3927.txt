Two helping hands are available. First analytics: as analytics becomes real time, 24/7 and [3

at a very large scale it may be possible in the future for companies, public institutions and
governments to receive much earlier warnings and intelligence about changes in the public’s
mood and attitudes (see discussion in [50]). Second there needs to be more research on the issues
of social norms within digital spaces which should yield a more subtle and useful taxonomy
of attitudes. This is computational sociology resting on analytics; and is the heart of modern
advances in social network analysis, community detection and much more, see [51], for example.
