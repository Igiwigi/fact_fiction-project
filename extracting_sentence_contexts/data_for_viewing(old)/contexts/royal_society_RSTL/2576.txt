the anatomy, together with the whole minute relations of the nerves, was a
dead letter, and led to no inference.

But now resuming the course I have hitherto followed, the anatomy of the
fifth nerve points. to curious results. We see that the motor division of this
nerve goes first to the muscles which close the jaw and give it the lateral or
grinding motions. Secondly, we see that it is distributed to the muscles of
the cheek, which place the morsel under the operation of the teeth; and thirdly,
we find it going to the muscles which open the jaws.

We proceed to the second method of proof, by experiment. - Does the fifth
nerve move the jaw? is it indeed the manducatory nerve as suggested by
the anatomy ? Let the following experiments determine the fact.

ExPERIMENT I.

The root of the fifth nerve being exposed in an ass and irritated, the jaws
closed with a snap.

ExPERIMENT IT.
The fifth pair being divided in an ass, the jaw fell relaxed and powerless.
If we consider the action of mastication, we shall see what the consequence
would be, were there no accordance between the motions of the lower jaw and
