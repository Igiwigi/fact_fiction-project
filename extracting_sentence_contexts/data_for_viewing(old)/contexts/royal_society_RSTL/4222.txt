of the superincumbent strata. Upon the correctness of this supposition the generic
identity of the Belemnoteuthis and the Belemnite entirely rests; for no specimen has
yet been met with, in which the guard of a Belemnite is in natural contact with
the muscular mantle, and other soft parts. If the phragmocone of the Belemnite,
and the chambered shell of the Belemnotenthis be not identical, then we know
nothing whatever, from actual observation, of the soft parts of the animal to which
the Belemnite belonged : to this point therefore I would first solicit particular atten-
tion.

Phragmocone of the Belemnoteuthis.â€”As the figures in the Philosophical Transac-
tions, 1844, Plate III., &c., and in the London Geological Journal, Plate XV. XVI.,
show the phragmocone in natural connection with the muscular tunic or mantle, &c.,
I need not adduce further examples of this undisputed fact, and will therefore only
remark, that snch specimens are of rare occurrence : in most instances, the detached
chambered $hell, more or less flattened, is found imbedded in the clay, with but few,
if any, vestiges of the soft parts, as in Plate XIII. figs. 1,2,3,5. In this state, these
fossils occurred by hundreds on the newly-exposed surface of the Oxford Clay near
Trowbridge. My son describes some areas when first laid bare by his labourers, as
being literally spangled over with the nacreous cones of Belemnoteuthes, and the
splendid iridescent shells of Ammonites ; while here and there Belemnites of large
size, with their phragmocones attached, were lying in relief. Upon drying, the thin
