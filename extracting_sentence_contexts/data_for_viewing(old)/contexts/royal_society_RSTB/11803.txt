the presence weight of member species m in cell i.

(vi) Conservation optimization

We used forward stepwise selection to identify future conserva-
tion priorities. We also tried backward stepwise elimination
and it yielded nearly identical results. Our algorithm begins

While most prior phylodiversity conservation studies have trea- scores shown in figure 2b), and calculates the hypothetical mar-
ted land conservation status as a binary variable, levels of ginal value of increasing each cell’s conservation status from its
