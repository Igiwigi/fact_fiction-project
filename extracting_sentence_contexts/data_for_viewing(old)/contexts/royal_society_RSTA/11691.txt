conduction through the gas, and yet each particle of the gas only strikes the wall of
the tube a comparatively small number of times during its passage through a length
of tube of 1 em. for example. It can be shown without very great difficulty that if &

is the average number of times which a particle of gas strikes the wall of the tube in
travelling through a distance of 1 cm. parallel to the axis, the effect on the heat loss
is to introduce a term which to the first order may be written —/*/k(n—4l) JSQ or
—h?/10kISQ, where n and / have the significance and values accorded to them on p. 212.
The correction thus tends in the opposite direction to that discussed on pp. 211-214.
Now, in view of the fact that there was only a small space between the wall of the
tube and the bundle of glass rods which contained the leads of the heating coil and
thermometers, and further, since the heating coil wire and the pieces of wire gauze,
&e., offered a large amount of obstruction to the flow of the gas, it is highly probable
that / was at least equal to 1. If we take & equal to unity, the correction for the
heat-loss term amounts to —h?/L0JSQ, and produces an effect amounting to about
5 parts in 10,000 on the value of the specific heat at 20° C. and 1 part per 1000 on
the value of the specific heat at 100° C. The effect tends in the opposite direction to
that discussed on pp. 211-214, but the conduction of heat to the walls of the tube
by the dises of copper gauze tends to make the value of the correction much smaller
than that above deduced, so that it is safe to assume that entire neglect of it does
not produce an error of more than 3 or 4 parts in 10,000 on the values of the specific
heats,
