87 In the remaining alloys the analyses indicated that a little zinc was lost in
melting, whilst the germanium and gallium contents by analysis were slightly greater
than those intended. This may be due to the fact that borax takes up a little of the
copper during the melting, or alternatively to segregation effects. In only one alloy
did the difference exceed 0+25%,, and in this the higher germanium content was
confirmed by the analysis of a further portion of the cooling curve ingot. which was
cut off and used for the solidus determination.
