The former gave the density of a slightly unsaturated solution, and the latter that of
a slightly supersaturated solution when referred to a solution saturated at its boiling-
point. The mean of these two observations was considered to be the density of the
solution saturated at the boiling-point—and similarly with the resulting solubilities.

The results obtained at the boiling-point were found not to be as concordant as

those at the other temperatures; doubtless the greater part of this is due to the
exceptional difficulties of the experiments. The following are some of the sources of
error. It was impossible to prevent the condensation of steam in the stem of the
pyknometer, and it was therefore necessary to estimate the length of each drop, and
add this length to the reading of the level in the stem. There was also an error
introduced by the fact that, for the purpose of reading its level, the solution had to
be sucked into the cold part of the stem which projected through the indiarubber
stopper; on reaching this colder part, salt immediately crystallises out; the total
volume thus changes, and the observed level is not that which the solution would
otherwise have attained. The maximum error possible from this cause was calculated
for the case of rubidium nitrate, and was found to be such as to give an error in the
density of 0°1 per cent.

Another and a much more important source of error was that the reduction of
pressure on the surface of the solution in the pyknometer, unavoidable when filling
by suction, very often caused steam bubbles to form. As it was essential to fill whilst
a large excess of undissolved salt was still being stirred by the steam, the solution
surrounding the pyknometer was often semi-opaque, and consequently it might
