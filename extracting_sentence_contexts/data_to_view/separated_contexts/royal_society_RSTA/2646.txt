Several obstacles are blocking increased nuclear power production. These include the fact that
there are few paths to the permanent safe storage of nuclear waste. In most of the world, spent
nuclear fuel is placed in dry casks after several years of cool down in water pools. The plutonium
in the spent nuclear fuel can be chemically separated.
