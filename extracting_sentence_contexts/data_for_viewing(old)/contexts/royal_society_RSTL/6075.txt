of glaciers, than the crushing of the three tributaries of the Mer de Glace through the
throat of the valley between Trelaporte and the base of the Aiguille du Moine. Not
wishing to trust the eyes in the estimation of distances here, each of the three confluent
branches was measured. 'The width of the Glacier du Geant, a short distance above the
Tacul, was found to be 5155 links, or 1134 yards. The width of the Glacier de Le&chaud,
just before its junction with the Talefre, was found to be 3725 links, or 825 yards. That
of the Talefre, before it is influenced by the pressure of the Lechaud, that is, across the
ice-cascade, was found, approximately, to be 2900 links, or 638 yards. Adding all
together, we find the sum of the widths of the three branch glaciers to be 2597 yards.
At Trelaporte these three branches are forced through a gorge 893 yards wide; and our
measurements show that it passes through with a velocity of nearly 20 inches a day !

Limiting our view to one of the glaciers thus compressed, the facts appear still more
astonishing. Previous to its junction with the Talefre, the Glacier de L6chaud has a
width of thirty-seven chains and a half. In passing through the jaws of the granite
vice at 'Trelaporte, this broad ice river is 8queezed to a driblet ess than four chains in
width! This fact illustrates the relation of the size and power of a glacier to the quan-
