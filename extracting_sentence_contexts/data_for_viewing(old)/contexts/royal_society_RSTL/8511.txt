306 MR, W. K. PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND

gives us the first intimation of the frontal ( F.) outside the orbito-sphenoid (0.8.). The
end of the middle turbinal is s8een from behind in the sphenoidal sinus ($.8.); at
this part the nidus of the vomer is most solid, and comes nearest, to hyaline cartilage
(fig. 145, v.), a state of things first pointed out to me by my friend Mr. Cas. Srewarr.

The proper territories of each investing bone in the Pig evidently only want, time
that they might all become true cartilage ; ossification sets in too s00n for the formation
of the intercellular substance, but each tract, before ossification, is a true morphological
clement or organ, as much $0 as the cartilaginous © operculars” and « branchiostegals”
of a Shark or the labial cartilages” of a Myxinoid. In illustration of these remarks
I have now to mention a fact new both to Professor HuxLey and myself, namely, that,
the substance which ossifies to become the dentary (figs. 14 & 14%, d,) becomes for the
most part very typical solid colourless cartilage, as much 80 as MECKEL's cartilage, which
it invests : I shall show this more fully in the next stage.

The fifteenth section (Plate XXXII. fig. 1) is through the fore edge of the optic
foramen ; and here we see the nasal wall (1.w.) closing in upon the presphenoid (p.s.),
and joining the end of the sphenoidal sinuses. Part of each optic nerve (2) is 8een in
this section, and for that reason the orbito-sphenoid appears distant from the median
cartilage below ; its continuity is seen in the vertical section (Plate XXXIIT. fig. 4).
Here the frontal (f.) is growing down towards the orbit, to which it will form a ceiling.

The sizteenth section (Plate XXXI1. fig. 2) is through the largest part of the hemi-
