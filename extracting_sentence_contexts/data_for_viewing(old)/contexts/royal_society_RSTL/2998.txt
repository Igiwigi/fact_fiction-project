stages, ante coitum, T have sought this membrane in yain as a distinct structure| ; but
I think it not improbable that the well-marked line generally regarded as representing
the internal surface of the thick chorion, may be partly due to the proper membrane
of the yelk, as is obviously the case in Plate V, fig. 17. e. and f.

50. It appears to me that the existence of a proper membrane of the yelk in the
ovary throughout the class Mammalia, may be inferred from what we know of the
effect observed to be produced on ova by maceration ; when the thick chorion, im-
bibing fluid into its interior, becomes distended beyond the size of the yelk-ball, but
the latter retains its form, which certainly would not be the case were not the yelk
circumscribed by a proper membrane (Plate VIII. fig. 72. f. and dF).

51. I have observyed a very interesting fact connected with the proper membrane
of the yelk post coitum not hitherto made known, which not only adds probability
to the supposition that this membrane has a previous existence, but also accords in
some degree with a change known to take place in Birds. I find that in the Rabbit,

+ ProfezxorR.Wacxzs in his examination of ova of the Frog, finding his *chorion” (ovisac) to disappear, makes
the following inquiry : © Ist sie nun mit der Dotterhaut yerschmolzen oder hat sie, was wahrscheinlicher ist,
sich an die gefissreiche Kelch-membran angelegt und bildet sie nur die innere Lamelle derselben ?” (Beitrige,
&e., 8, 76.) This inquiry, made by one of the most accurate of observers, bespeaks, I think, the perception,
in a single instance, of something that was very near the truth,
