to the side of the brain, 7.e., their position is Reptilian, and this is emphasised by the
foramina.

The foramen acusticum internum (fig. 1, for.at.) (internal auditory meatus) is
vertical and faces directly inwards. It is large and is not yet divided by a bar, i.e.,
the cochlear and vestibular branches of the auditory nerve have a common entrance,
The fenestra ovalis (fen.o.) faces directly outwards, and not outwards and down-
wards as is the rule in adults. The semicircular canals in this stage are well de-
veloped and normal. The aquaducius vestibuli (ag.v.) opens immediately behind
the internal meatus (fig. 1), and lies in the same position as in Sphenodon (27). The
internal meatus and the aqueductus vestibuli are confluent in the model, owing
to the fact that the extremely young procartilaginous division has not been
modelled.

The fenestra rotunda (fen.7.) faces outwards and backwards. It is hidden in the
lateral view by the overlapping tegmen tympani (t.ty.). This is very large, and hides
a considerable portion of the capsule, as well as most of the course of the facial nerve.

The aquaeductus Fallopii (fig. 1, ag. f.), or foramen faciale, which transmits the seventh
nerve from the cranium, is formed by the hooked-shaped upper part of the pars
cochlearis, termed by Mrap (31) “ the roof of the foramen faciale,” and by Vorr (45)
the commissura suprafacialis, In this stage the commissura is very slight, but with
development it increases in strength.
