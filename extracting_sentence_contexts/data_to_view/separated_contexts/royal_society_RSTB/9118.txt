These are important
findings for continued fruitful study of the health effects
of exposure to light-at-night, and thereby what interven-
tion and mitigation strategies might be most effective in
the future. Lucas ef al. [54] address the question of optimal lighting
for the modern life and circadian health. They describe the
physiology of the non-visual light detection pathway, the fact
that it is most sensitive to wavelength 480 nm, and they
advocate an additional light exposure metric based on this
biology. The standard illumination unit is ‘photopic lux’ or
usually shortened to ‘lux’. Meters to measure illumination,
used by photographers for example, are calibrated to weight
the wavelength of the incident light to yield a single number
reflecting the best colour (or daytime) vision in human
beings, the peak wavelength for which is 555 nm.
