Experiment No. 1 forms the only exceptional case, and the departure is not a wide one ;
80 that the result cannot be viewed as accidental, or due to any balancing of errors, but
as the expression in s0 far of a fact of nature. Nor is it due to relative differences of different experiments in the lengths of range,
in the quartz rock and in the slate respectively, as might be imagined ; for the experi-
ments Nos. 2, 5, and 6 had wave-paths of about 1400 feet in quartz only, and embrace
the lowest and the highest velocities, while Nos. 1, 3, and 4 had about double this
range or wave-path in quartz, with velocities not widely different from each other, or
from No. 2.
