The * Bellerophon * is divided into two parts by the transverse plane containing her
centre of gravity, such that the foremost or heavier part weighs 3825 tons, and has its
centre of gravity 54 feet before the plane of division. The maximum shearing-force for
support at the middle is therefore 3825 tons, a little greater than in the previous poxi-
tion, and we have

Maximum hogging-moment=3825 tons x 54 ft.
=206,500 foot-tons (in round numbers); or abont
=displacement x {5 of the length.

This moment is considerably under two thirds of the maximum sagging-moment pre-
viously found for this ship ; and we have in this fact an illustration of the statement
made above respecting the difference existing between the exceptional hogging- and
$agging-strains in ships with concentrated weights amidships as compared with other
ships. In the * Victoria and Albert * we should expect to find a more striking illustra-
tion, and we really do s0. Her after body is heavier than the fore body, and its weight,
1330 tons, constitutes the maximum shearing-force, while the centre of gravity is 46
feet abaft the centre of gravity of the whole ship. Hence we have

Maximum hogging-moment=1330 tons x 46 ft.
=61,200 foot-tons (in round numbers); or about
=displacement X 4x of the length.

The maximum sagging-moment in this ship is therefore not very much less than double
