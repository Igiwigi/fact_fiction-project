It concerns the behaviour of the nucleolus. The
separation of the egg from its follicle cells in Limulus is not the only event which
synchronises with the commencement of yolk formation, for this moment is also marked
by the total disappearance of the nucleolus. In considering the behaviour of the

_latter structure in Antedon, and in attempting to harmonise the absence of any trace
of correlation between its activity and the commencement of yolk formation with the
fact that this activity ceased entirely with the completion of the latter process,
T suggested that the activity of the nucleolus might be concerned with a much more
fundamental and wide-spread metabolic process of the cytoplasm than that which is
represented by yolk formation, and that it is the cessation of this more fundamental
process, at the completion of yolk formation, which -brings about the cessation of
nucleolar activity. I also pointed out that not only did such a suggestion remove
the difficulty that the nucleolar activity was characteristic of the whole of the growth
period of the egg preceding yolk formation, but that a large nucleolus is characteristic
of many cells which differ widely in the result of their metabolic activity (e.g., gland
cells and ganglion cells), A comparison between the behaviour of the nucleolus in
Antedon with that described for Limulus by Munson offers most striking confirmation
of this suggestion that the nucleolar activity is related to the metabolism of the
cytoplasm as a whole, rather than to the very small part of its activity which is
represented by the conversion of the accumulated metaplastic material into a form
sufficiently stable to survive the period of quiescence which succeeds the completion
of the eggâ€™s growth. In Antedon, since there is no sudden change in the relation of
the egg to its surroundings at the commencement of yolk formation, we may suppose
that nutrition, and the accompanying processes of respiration and excretion, still
continue, though doubtless in ever-diminishing intensity, and that they only finally
cease with the cessation of all cell-activity which accompanies the completion of yolk
formation.
