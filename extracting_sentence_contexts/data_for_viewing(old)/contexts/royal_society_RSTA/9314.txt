amount is twice as great as when Rb replaces K; for the average and maximum
changes of angles are directly proportional to the change of atomic weight when one
alkali metal is substituted for another. (K = 88°85 when H = 1, Rb= 849, and

Cs = 181°9, and Be = 85'4; also Rb—K = 46, and Cs—Rb= 47.) The

maximum change of angle observed for the replacement of K by Cs occurs in the
magnesium group, and is 2° 25’; the replacement of K by NH, in the same group
provokes a change of nearly the same amount, 2° 18’, while the change for the
replacement of K by Rb is exactly half the value for the Cs replacement, namely,
1° 12’. This direct proportionality of the average and maximum change of angle to
the change in atomic weight of the alkali metal is one of the most striking and
important of all the facts brought to light by this prolonged investigation, and is
rendered the more important by the large amounts of these changes. It is also
interesting to note that the change (strictly proportional to that in atomic weight)
in the most important of the angles, the axial angle 8, between the primary
orthopinakoid @ {100} and basal plane ¢ {001}, is so large as to be nearly equal to the
maximum, and in several groups this angle is actually itself the angle of maximum
change. These conclusions are, therefore, far away from any possible experimental
error, which at the highest estimate could not exceed 5’ and probably does not
exceed 3/,
