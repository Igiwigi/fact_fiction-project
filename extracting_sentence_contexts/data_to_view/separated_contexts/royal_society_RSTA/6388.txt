To try to clarify, I will give a brief
and selective recap of how thermodynamic ideas entered the social sciences, concentrating on
sociology, and then consider what possibilities there are for future thought.

2. The early days of social statistics

It is true that early social scientific thought was inspired by physics, but it is not true that such
thought was inspired by thermodynamics. In fact, the reverse is true: thermodynamics was
inspired by social thought and took its ideas not from the mathematics whereby they had first
been worked out in astronomy, but indirectly, via social science. The famous law of errors, the inverse square law, had already been developed when the young
Belgian scientist Adolphe Quetelet? went to Paris to learn astronomy. He made the creative
transfer of the mathematics he learned there, mathematics for the repeated observations of a
single unit subject to error, to the different case of single measurements for repeated units.
