hierarchy by exploiting taxonomic information linked to bar-
code records from known species. There will be a need for
sustained vigilance to ensure that specimens providing bar-
code records have reliable taxonomic assignments. While
major errors are easily recognized, misidentifications of closely
allied species require careful examination to recognize and cor-
rect [56,57]. The development of a barcode library for known
species is aided by ongoing efforts to create a registry of
valid species names [58], but ‘dark taxa’, those only known
from their DNA barcode sequences, will represent an increas-
ingly important challenge [32]. Although it is ultimately
desirable to have all specimens with a sequence, a name and
associated data, the fact that BINs provide a stable framework
for subsequent annotation and data enrichment is a major
breakthrough for tackling poorly known mega-diverse
groups [39]. Aside from the well-recognized challenges in (b) Plants
the storage and analysis of the data generated by HTS, studies
enabled by this technology will undoubtedly illuminate
massive numbers of dark taxa.

DNA barcoding confronts the challenge that many plant
species are exposed to hybridization and introgression, while
others have arisen via polyploidy in a near-instantaneous
fashion. Moreover, the evolutionary rates of their mitochon-
