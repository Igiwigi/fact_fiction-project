Therefore 8 = 57a, so that the rate of the change

AC+ BD = AB+CD
is fifty-seven times the rate of the change

AB + CD = AC + BD. The equation of the course of the change when r = 1 is

If in each of these cases the change is allowed to proceed until the value of y is
ithin 1 per cent. of the value p which it attains, after a theoretically infinite time,
hen equilibrium is established, and ¢,, ¢;, t; are in each case the intervals from the
commencement of the change to the instant when y has the value 99p, then
t,: ty : ts = 30: 7 : 2 nearly; so that if the change reaches this point in the third case
in two minutes, it will not reach it in the first case until the change has proceeded for
at least half an hour. This fact probably accounts for the difference between the
observed and calculated values of y in the earlier part of the following table; for it is
possible that the observations in the experiments in which a small quantity of
potassium sulphocyanide was taken, were made before the change had practically
reached its limit, in which case the observed values of p would be too small. In the
following table r is the number of units of potassium sulphocyanide (the amount of
ferric nitrate being unity), p’ the amount of red salt formed expressed in the arbitrary
units adopted by Dr. Guapsrone and p the number of units of change when equili-
brium is established.
