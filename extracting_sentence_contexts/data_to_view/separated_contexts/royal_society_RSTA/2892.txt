THE present memoir is the outcome of an attempt to obtain the conditions under
which a given symmetric and continuous function « (s,¢) is definite, in the sense of
Hivserr.* At an early stage, however, it was found that the class of definite
functions was too restricted to allow the determination of necessary and suflicient
conditions in terms of the determinants of §10. The discovery that this could be
done for functions of positive or negative type, and the fact that almost all the
theorems which are true of definite functions are, with slight modification, true of
these, led finally to the abandonment of the original plan in favour of a discussion of
the properties of functions belonging to the wider classes. The first part of the memoir is devoted to the definition of various terms employed,
and to the re-statement of the consequences which follow from Hiipert’s theorem. In the second part, keeping the theory of quadratic forms in view, the necessary
and sufficient conditions, already alluded to, are obtained.
