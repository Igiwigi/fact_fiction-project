It is probably by very
fine fibres alone and their nuclei, that the tissues are influenced. The ordinary nerve-
fibres are only the cords which connect this extensive peripheral system (which has been
traced in different tissues far beyond the point to which the dark-bordered nerve-fibres
can be followed) with the central organs of the nervous system.

11. The facts and conclusions aboye stated, with reference to the distribution of nerye-
fibres to the voluntary muscles of the frog, are in accordance with the arrangement of the
finest nerye-fibres demonstrated in many other tissues of the same animal, and agree with

many appearances obseryed by the author in connexion with the peripheral distribution
of the nerves, not only in certain tissues A man and the higher animals, but also in in-
vertebrate animals,

12. The distribution of the finest branches of the nerve-fibres can only be .demon-

strated in tissues which have been immersed in fluids which refract highly, as syrup' or
glycerine. EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES.
