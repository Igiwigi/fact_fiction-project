experiments made with some powerful voltaic batteries, for the purpose of determi-
ning the possibility of obtaining a spark before the completion of the voltaic circuit.
I was therein enabled to establish a few facts respecting polar tension, or rather
respecting the absence of any notable degree of it in the batteries I described* ; for
instance, I proved that, with 320 series of Professor DaN1ELL's constant battery, polar
tension was not evinced adequate to the striking distance of z7;5th of an inch ; nor
was I more snccessful in obtaining it with a water battery of 1024 seriesF, constructed
by the same gentleman. I also stated that, according to the present theoretical
views of the action of the voltaic battery, with the apparatus I then used, it ought to
have taken place ; and that, if by a still more powerful apparatus it could not be
obtained, the theory must, in some way or other, be incorrect.

2. The preceding negative facts are not without their value in a scientific point of
view; they show us, at least, a certain limit within which the anticipated effects
could not be obtained. At the same time I conld not fail to admit that they were
anything but conelusive, as to the actual question of the possibility of obtaining the
spark before the circuit was completed. That I am justified in calling the spark,
under such circumstances, an anticipated effect, may be fairly assumed, because
every electrician is aware that the terminals of a voltaic series invariably evince a
certain amount of tension$; and as spark is but a consequence of tension exalted
to a maximum, it is only fair to anticipate that, by increasing the tension, it would
be obtained.

munication reached me from my friend Mr. Crosss, of Broomfield, Somersetshire,
