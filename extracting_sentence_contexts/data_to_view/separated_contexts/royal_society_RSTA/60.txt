The choice of principles addresses our speech on a class of natural phenomena. The formal
expression in mathematical terms of the foundational principles adopted determines linguistic
structures. In fact, mathematics is a language with a singular peculiarity: it allows us to express
statements that are at the same time qualitative and quantitative without resorting to structures
of other languages. For example, when we affirm, e.g., that the readers of this article will be at
most five, we are using English and we qualify the persons involved in our statement—readers—
but to quantify them we resort to a concept—the number five—pertaining to mathematics. This
peculiar aspect furnishes some indications on the descriptive effectiveness of mathematics in
representing nature.
