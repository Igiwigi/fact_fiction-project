The evolution kernel is evaluated in Euclidean time because the expressions are
mathematically more rigorous and transparent than in Minkowski time. The Euclidean
(imaginary time) evolution kernel is given by

K(x,x;7) = (xje |x’). (B1)

Note [-, Vv) #0, and it is this non-commutativity that poses the main problem in quantum
mechanics. Ignoring the non-commutativity yields et! ~ e-*"/2") e—tV, and for this case

K(x,x'31) = (xje~(P°/2m) eV Ix’) _ eH TV) (y]q@-FP*/2) 1 x/) (B2)

and the evolution kernel K requires the kernel for the free particle Hamiltonian p?/2m.
Note the remarkable fact that for non-commuting operators A and B

as Bb = eATBH(1/2)[A B+ | (B 3)
For t =€¢, infinitesimal time, one has the following result:
eH =e P/2mHV) <p eP/2m eV Ole). (B4)

Hence for infinitesimal time ¢, from equation (B2) the transition amplitude K(x,x’;¢) can be
evaluated exactly to O(e?).


The path integral approach is employed fundamentally to build up the finite time transition
amplitude by composing the infinitesimal time transition amplitude by repeatedly using the
resolution of the identity operator.
