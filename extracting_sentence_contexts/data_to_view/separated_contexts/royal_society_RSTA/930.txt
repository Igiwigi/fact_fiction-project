Existence of asymptotic velocities is a fundamental result in classical scattering theory, whose :8
proof is quite involved (see also [2, ch. 12.6]). As the o* are constants of the motion, they :<
present a weak form of integrability. In fact, in the non-empty open set of xo leading to a trivial : a
cluster partition (all ;*(xo) being different), 5+ is smooth if (1.2) is valid for all multi-indices : 2
Be nv. However, in the presence of non-trivial clusters, one would need more constants of {2

the motion or other asymptotic information [3,4] to have the so-called asymptotic completeness,
see [1]. For the unbounded potentials considered here, the question of classical asymptotic
completeness is even more involved.
