Second, the morphology of the snowflakes becomes coarser in order to minimize
their surface area and, hence, surface energy. Third, snow undergoes changes because it usually
resides in a temperature gradient in a snowpack since the sun heats the surface during the
day while during the cold night air cools the surface. In fact, snow often experiences diurnal
alternating temperature gradients. In a temperature gradient, dry snow undergoes much more
rapid microstructural changes than under isothermal conditions [18]. A temperature gradient in
snow produces a water vapour pressure gradient.
