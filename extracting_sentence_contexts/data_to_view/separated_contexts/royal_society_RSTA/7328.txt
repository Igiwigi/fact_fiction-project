Example 1. Consider the ‘square frame’ S$ of points (x,y) in two-dimensional space
satisfying t 1<max (|x|, |y|) <2. If X is any point other than O of a lattice A satisfying

max (| «|, | y|)<2,

then it is clear that there is a point of A of the form mX, where m Pye... 3S; Us
using our definition, the determinant of S is the same as that of the set

max (|x|, |¥|)<2,
and so A(S) = 4.

a But the lattice of points with integral co-ordinates has no point in the interior of S, and

nd in fact it is easy to see that A,,(S) = 1).
‘o Example 2. Take S to be the set formed by adding to the set of all points X = (x,y)
