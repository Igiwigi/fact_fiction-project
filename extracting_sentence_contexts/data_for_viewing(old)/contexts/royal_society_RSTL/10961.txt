&Z meet, 80 that the end of the hard palate is bracket-shaped ; in front of each thickening
Ãž the oblique posterior palatine foramen (p.p.f.) is seen. These narrow curved
E palatines lie like scales under the maxillary plates, and their curved thin fore edge
= retreats, laterally, and then turns a little inwards, where it is pressed against the
& veolar wall of the two last teeth. The thick side wall of the open parb still gently
R curves inwards ; it is separated outside from the palatine portion by a large sharp
notch. The shell-like orbital or ascending part of the palatines meets the hinder part
of the main vomer (v.), almost reaching as far backwards as its four terminal prongs.
The small pterygoids ( pg.) also ascend, and below, where they are spliced obliquely Lo
the palatine wall of the great nasopalatine canal, they end, behind, in the hamular
process, which is small, flat, and turned outwards ; it is supported, outside, by
the equally small external pterygoid process (e.pg.). The pterygoid is very small, as
in the Marsupials, and this comes from the fact that what is generally, in the higher
mammals, the upper or basicranial flange, is here, as in the Marsupials, a long, tongue-
shaped mesopterygoid (ms.pg.). This flat bone is sharp in front, where it wedges in

sphenoid (b.s.) ; its front part hides the side of the presphenoid (p.s.); it is gently
arcuate, the convex side being towards the mid-line. To 8ee the rest of the splints
