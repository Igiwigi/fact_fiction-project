The effects of the linear dissipation on both linear
and nonlinear oscillators are well known [1-3]. In this
sense, the amplitude of the oscillations decays and
eventually goes to zero more or less rapidly depending
on the magnitude of the damping term. However,
when the dissipation competes with an external forcing,

oscillations may survive or decay, depending on the intensities of both terms. In fact, this
competition gives birth to different effects on the dynamics of an oscillator, as studied in [4],
where it has been analysed how the dissipation can introduce uncertainty in the topology of the
phase space of the system and how the forcing can counter it.

Here, we aim to extend the current knowledge on the effects of dissipation for time-delayed
oscillators. This kind of systems include a term that depends on a time interval [—1,0] of the
history of the system, where t is the time delay. This term may destroy stabilities [5] and induces
oscillations on the system depending on its parameters. In physical and biological systems, the
time delay accounts for the finite propagation time as information is not immediately propagated
in nature. This means that the future evolution of the system depends not only on its present
state, but on its previous states. This is why we talk about history functions instead of initial
conditions. History functions are sets of initial conditions in the continuous time interval [—r,0]
