visibility of Batmemr’s series of Hydrogen lines in the solar spectrum. It is note-
worthy, in this connection, that the Diffuse series of elements are those in which the
Rydberg phase constant is nearly unity, so they accord very closely, in quite general
terms, with the present principles underlying Bour’s theory. So far as the present
investigation is concerned, the quantitative examination of the alteration of the
spectrum of Helium produced by reduction of pressure lends a certain amount of
support to Bour’s theory, at, the same time, however, implying that the theory in
question, if in its general basis correct as regards Diffuse series, does not furnish any
interpretation of the origin of Principal series, in which the Rydberg phase is usually
widely different from unity. We do not, however, propose to discuss this question
further at the present time, as evidence in the other direction can be adduced also.
For example, we showed in a previous communication that the Balmer series of
Hydrogen lines does not in fact possess the characteristics of a Diffuse series, for the
separations of the doublets which compose it are not constant as regards wave number,
but are, on the other hand, appropriate to a Principal series. The question of the
relation of our results to Bonr’s theory must therefore be left unsolved at the present
time, and we prefer to summarise the selective effect of low pressure in individual
series in the Helium spectrum into the statement that while in the Diffuse and Sharp
series, there is an energy transfer to higher term numbers, the effect on the Principal
series is in the opposite sense.

We have not, of course, yet examined the effect of low pressure on the Diffuse and
Sharp series of Parhelium. This examination will be given briefly after the corre-
sponding tables have been exhibited, and will be found to correspond exactly to the
similar effects observed in Helium. Meanwhile, we may complete the discussion of
