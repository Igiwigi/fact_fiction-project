s It will be seen that practically no effect is produced by this large dose. The pulse
g& is firm and strong from first to last, and never deviates much from the original rate

the pressure is only 11 millims. below the original level, the breathing slightly
9 accelerated, the vagus in full function.

In view of the fact that the experiment had lasted considerably over three hours,
it may be assumed that a positive strengthening of the cardiac systole had resulted.

At this time it was resolved to test the action of aconitine, as previous experiments
had led to the opinion that aconine antagonised the more powerful alkaloid to some
extent. The record of the continuation of the experiments is as follows :—
