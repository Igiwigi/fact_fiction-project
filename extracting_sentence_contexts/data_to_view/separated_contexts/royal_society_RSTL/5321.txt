In article (5) T proceed to
determine by a direct method these simplified residnes in terms of the coefficients of
F and @. Beginning with the case where,F and 9 are of the same'dimensions'(1m) in x,
I obserye that we may deduce from f'and © m linearly independent frtinctions of
each of the degree (m—1) in a, all of them syzygetic functions of Fand'p (vanishing
when these two simultaneously vanish), and, with coefficients which.are made up of
terms, each of which is the product of one coefficient of F and one coefficient of 9. These, in fact, are the very same (m) functions as are employed in the method which
goes by the name of Bezovur's abridged method to obtain the resultant to (z. e. the
resnlt of the elimination of x performed upon) Fand'p. As these derived functions are
of frequent occurrence, I find it necessary to give them a name, and I term them the (m)
Bezoutics or Bezoutian Primaries ; from these (m) primaries m Bezoutian secondaries
may be deduced by eliminating linearly between them in the order in which they are
generated,—first, the highest power of x between two, then the two highest powers of
x between three, and finally, all the powers of x between them all: along with the
system thus formed it is necessary to include the first Bezoutian primary, and to con-
sider it accordingly as being also the first Bezoutian secondary ; the last Bezoutian
Secondary is a constant identical with the Resultant of Fand . When the m times m
coeflicients of the Bezoutian primaries are conceived as separated from the powers of z
and arranged in a square, I term such square the Bezoutic square.
