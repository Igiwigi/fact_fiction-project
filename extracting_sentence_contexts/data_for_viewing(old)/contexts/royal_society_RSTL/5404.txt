three-tenths of a degree ; but we shall see that its value is probably about 273-7,

agreeing with the value of Jat 0* found by the first method in Section ITI. From the

very close approximation to equality between Z and a+ which our experiments

have established, we may be sure that temperature from the freezing-point by the
new system must agree to a yery minute fraction of a degree with Centigrade tempe-
rature between the two prescribed points of agreement, 0* and 100*, and we may
consider it as highly probable that there will also be a very close agreement through
a wide range on each side of these limits. It becomes of course an object of the
greatest importance, when the new system is adopted, to compare it with the old
standard ; and this is in fact what is substituted for the problem, the evaluation of
Carxor's function, now that it is proposed to call the reciprocal of Carnor's function,
temperature. In the next Section we hall see by what kind of examination of the
physical properties of air this is to be done, and investigate an empirical formula
expressing them consistently with all the experimental data as yet to be had, s0 far
as we know. The following Table, showing the indications of the constant-volume
and constant-pressure air-thermometer in comparison for every twenty degrees of
the new scale, from the freezing-point to 300* above it, has been calculated from the
formulz (9), (10), and (39) of Section V. below.
