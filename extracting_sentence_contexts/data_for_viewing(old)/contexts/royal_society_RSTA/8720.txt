diamagnetic.

“Let us now examine a magnetic crystal of similar form. Sulphate of nickel is,
perhaps, as good an example as we can choose. Suspended in the magnetic field with
its axis horizontal, on exciting the magnet the axis will set itself from pole to pole,
and this position will be persisted in, even when the axial dimension is shortest.
Suspended from its end, the crystalline prism will take up an oblique position with
considerable energy. When the crystal thus suspended has come to rest, mark the
line along its end which stands awial. Let a knife edge be laid along this line and
pressed in a direction parallel to the axis of the prism. The crystal will yield before
the edge and discover a perfectly clean plane of cleavage.

“These facts are suggestive. The crystals here experimented with are of the same
outward form; each has but one cleavage, and the position of this cleavage with
regard to the form of the erystal, is the same in all. The magnetic force, however,
at once discovers a difference of action. The cleavages of the diamagnetic specimens
stand equatorial ; of the magnetic, awial.

“A cube cut from a prism of scapolite, the axis of the prism being perpendicular to
two of the parallel faces of the cube, suspended in the magnetic field, sets itself with
the axis of the prism from pole to pole.

“A cube of beryl of the same dimensions with the axis of the prism from which it is
taken also perpendicular to two of the faces, suspended as in the former case, sets itself
