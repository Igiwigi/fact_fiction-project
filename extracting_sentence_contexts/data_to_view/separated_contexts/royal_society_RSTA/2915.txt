The SST on which this ConceFT
representation is based is calculated using a Battle-Lemarié mother wavelet basis BL3 [30], and
20 realizations of the SST. A Morlet mother wavelet provides less clear results in this case. This
could be due to the fact that the ConceFT method is based on averaging semi-independent
SST outcomes; thus, orthogonality of the Battle-Lemarié mother wavelet helps reducing noise

Figure 7. LIGO signal H1 presented in figure 1 analysed using the ConceFT and the SST techniques. A total of 20 realizations [=
of the SST with a Battle—Lemarié mother wavelet basis BL3 [30] are used to run the ConceFT algorithm.
