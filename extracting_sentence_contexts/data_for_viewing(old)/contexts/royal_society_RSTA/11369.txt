be stable zz vacuo at a dull red heat. The substance formed during the absorption
of oxygen has a dark brown colour, has lost all the appearance of palladium sponge,
and is, without doubt, an oxide or mixture of oxides.

According to WruM (‘ Berichte,’ 1882, p. 2225), the sub-oxide of palladium, Pd,O,
may be prepared by heating the sponge in a current of air until it attains a constant
weight. If this is so, it is curious that we have not been able to observe any
discontinuity in the absorption of oxygen, and we are inclined to think that palladium
sponge, if heated for a sufficiently long time in a current of air, should yield not the
sub-oxide, but palladium oxide, PdO.

We have already seen that palladium black, prepared in the way described,
contains about 140 volumes, or 1°65 per cent. of oxygen, and the fact that the
substance was dried at 100° C. probably accounts for the presence of a certain
quantity of this oxygen. In connection with the calorimetric experiments to be
described later on, it was of interest to us to know how much oxygen palladium
black, rendered free from oxygen, would absorb directly at 0° or at the ordinary
temperature. We found it impossible to remove the oxygen without converting the
black into sponge, but the required information was obtained in the following way :—

The sample of palladium black was fully charged up with hydrogen, whereby all
the oxygen was removed as water. As will be seen presently, the bulk (over
90 per cent.) of the occluded hydrogen was next extracted by exhausting at 100° C.
To the palladium black containing only a comparatively small quantity of hydrogen,
oxygen was then admitted, in the first instance very slowly, whilst the experimental
