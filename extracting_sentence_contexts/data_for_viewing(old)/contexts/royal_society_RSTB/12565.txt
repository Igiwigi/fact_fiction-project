interpretation of noun phrases (e.g. [5]). For example, a noun
phrase like a run in a sentence Mary saw a run is interpreted as
“(A x) (run (x) & see (m, x)’ which explicitly contains the predicate
run as applied to the individual denoted by the variable name
‘x’ as in ‘run (x)’, being m the constant denoting Mary. However,
that this predicative structure is different from the predicative
link defining clausal structures can be easily proved by observ-
ing the following contrast:

(2)a * John says the run.
b John says they run.

In fact, the notion of clause structure has been captured in
formal linguistics by the simple formula describing any
sentence (S) as the link between a noun phrase (NP) and a
verb phrase (VP) ‘S— NP VP’ which underlies (1)b where
the notion of subject is unambiguously assigned to the NP
and that of predicate to the VP. Notably, ‘This idea of defining
functional notions in configurational terms has been a constant
within the developing of Chomsky’s theories and one of the
great contributions he has given to syntactic theory’ [6, p. 88].

In this paper I will propose that predication can be
derived from purely configurational factors as generated on
a simple binary combinatorial operation.
