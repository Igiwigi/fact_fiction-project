They may include very finely
dispersed clay (Sverdrup et al. 1942). On the other hand, Clarke & James (1939) showed that
very efficient filtration of sea water with a Berkfeld filter can reduce the scattering coefficient
almost to zero, the filtrate having in the green and red portions of the spectrum the same
extinction coefficients as distilled water; values of p exceeding about 2 (i.e. D/A ratios smaller
than 0-6) may therefore be uncommon.

(b) The ratio of the light scattered upwards to that travelling downwards within the
water is in fact small (Atkins & Poole 1940; Sverdrup et al. 1942), suggesting an indicatrix
of diffusion corresponding to a D/A ratio exceeding 0-5, that is, a p value of less than 2.

(c) It will be shown in part III of this paper that measurements of extinction coefficients
with narrow band filters in a modified Pulfrich photometer have given p values varying
between the limits 0-7 and 1-5.

(2) Extinction coefficients calculated from brightness profiles agree well with theoretical
coefficients based on a p of 1. It will therefore be assumed that in normal coastal water, the scattering coefficient #
varies inversely as about the first power of the wave-length over the red and green portions
of the spectrum. Because the effective wave-lengths of the filters used in this work are
numerically close, variations in the p value are not important.
