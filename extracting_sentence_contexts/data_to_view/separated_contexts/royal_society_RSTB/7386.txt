It appears probable that a similar method could be
used to measure the sections directly through the microscope; for this purpose the photo-
graphic reduction would need to be considerably greater, to a size suitable for an eyepiece
graticule; the circles might be printed on film and this mounted between cover-slips. When determining plastochrone ratios oblique sections should be avoided as far as
possible. Single determinations of r (e.g. derived from the distances from the centre of
primordia 1 and 2, or of 2 and 3) are subject to considerable error, owing largely to the
fact that the primordia compared are situated in very different azimuths; one region of an
apex may differ slightly from another in its growth and irregularities persist sufficiently long
to be reflected in the phyllotaxis pattern; obliquity of the sections would produce a similar
effect. Hence measurements in radial directions inclined to one another at only small
angles are preferable. In Fibonacci phyllotaxis this means that primordia differing in age
by 2, or better by 3, 5, 8, etc., plastochrones should be compared, according to the height
of the system.
