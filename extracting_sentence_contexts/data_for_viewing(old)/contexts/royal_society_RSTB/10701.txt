from differences in buffer conditions, this PRE subset of
their data is therefore comparable with the datasets analysed
by Agirrezabala et al. [52,57] and Julian et al. [58]. Fischer et al.
[40] found at least two intermediate states in this pool. The
cryo-EM study by Spahnâ€™s group [69] provided a similar
inventory of the PRE states for the eukaryotic ribosome.

As mentioned earlier, Agirrezabala et al. [52] compiled a
tabulation of all intermediate PRE states of the E. coli ribo-
some published at the time, coming from both X-ray and
cryo-EM studies, together with intersubunit rotation angles
and other parameters describing ribosomal domain and
tRNA positions. This tabulation of states in fact indicated
up to eight different observed intersubunit rotation angles
and concomitant domain and tRNA constellations, although
it is not clear to what extent inclusion of data from X-ray crys-
tallography in which two ribosomes contained in the
asymmetric unit happen to be in different states of rotation
and domain constellations [70-73] is relevant to a discussion
of authentic functional states.


A new approach to resolving heterogeneity, by employing head movement (Bla) and intersubunit rotation (B4, B7a,
manifold embedding of cryo-EM projection data, promises to B8), was found to accelerate the maximal rate of translocation.
tackle this issue more conclusively as the technique is capable
