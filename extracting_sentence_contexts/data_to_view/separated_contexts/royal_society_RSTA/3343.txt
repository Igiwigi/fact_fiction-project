The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of the Universe is increasing [15]. 5&8
In apparent contrast to the second law, matter and radiation appear have started out in .
thermodynamic equilibrium—a high entropy state [16,17]. In addition, the gravitational field at
the birth of the Universe was highly structured (low entropy yet also smooth and featureless) but
is becoming less ordered [18]. These two facts coupled to confusing use of the terms, ‘entropy’,
‘structure’, ‘order’, ‘uniformity’, etc. have led to a variety of at odds or unclear positions on what
it means to say that entropy is increasing. As I am by no means an expert on this topic, I, with
gratitude to Sean Carroll, refer the reader to Wallace [17], who nicely summarizes the conventional
thinking and space of positions. He offers a restatement in which he emphasizes that the early
Universe was not at global thermal equilibrium, only local thermal equilibrium, and gives the
reasons why.
