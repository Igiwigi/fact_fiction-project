Mention has already been made (vide section 8) of the increase in value of the
product pk at low pressures in the case of air, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide, and -
of the diminution in the case of vapours, e.g. ethyl chloride, when the pressures
approach the vapour pressure at the temperature under consideration. Such
deviations from the law pk = constant could be ascribed to variations in the size
of the cluster constituting the ion; however, they follow readily from the expression
(«) of the mobility if we take into account the deviation from the law of MaxwELi
which states that the coefficient of viscosity of a gas or vapour is independent of its
density. In the case of gases it is known that y diminishes as the pressure is reduced
beyond a certain value ;* such a diminution would, according to the theory here
given, produce an increase in the value of pk. In the case of vapours it has been
established that 7 increases rapidly as the saturated state is approached ; in fact, as a
result of WarpurG and von Bazo’s experiments on the viscosity of CO, at high
pressures, Meyer} came to the conclusion that the experimental values above certain
pressures could be explained only by supposing carbon dioxide to behave as a liquid,
the density of which is practically independent of pressure ; an increase in the value
of » would, according to the expression («), diminish the product pk, a result in
accordance with experimental observations.

10. Summary.

1. The velocities of the positive and negative ions produced by Réntgen rays in
4 gases and 15 vapours have been measured at normal temperatures over a wide
range of pressures and under different electric intensities. LANGEvIN’s null method
