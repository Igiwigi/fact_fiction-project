NEVIN ON ROTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE

The letters which appear in some cases after the intensity figure have the following
meanings: b, blend of two or more lines which appears comparatively sharp; d, diffuse
line; c, line confused with another line which,may affect both the wave-length and the
intensity; v, line shaded towards the violet. THE INITIAL 4) STATE

The combination differences for the initial state derived from equations 1 and 2
are as follows:

It is shown later that ¢ = 0:1487 cm.~! and y = —0-00033 cm.~!, so that, except for

the very lowest values of K, the sum of the third and fourth terms in these expressions
can be neglected. Inspection of Tables XIII—XV shows that the four values of A, F/ (J)
which correspond to the same value of K are in fact equal when K is greater than four. Accordingly we can write

A, F'(K) = 4Bi(K+}) +8D,(K+ 3)?. (6)

Taking as A, F’’ (K) the average of the four values of 4, F/(K) the graph of 4, F’(K)/K+-4
against (K +4)? is plotted. It is a straight line from the slope of which D/ is found.
