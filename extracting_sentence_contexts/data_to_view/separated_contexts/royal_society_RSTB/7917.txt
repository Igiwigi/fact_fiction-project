He endeavours to explain away this awkward observation


MICRASTER CORANGUINUM AND M. (ISOMICRASTER) SENONENSIS 421

by suggesting that Lambert was mistaken in attributing these specimens to M. senonensis. It is very unlikely that so acute an observer as Lambert would have made such a mistake;
and, anyhow, perfectly good examples of M. senonensis may well have a slight fascioleâ€”
for example, specimen E32536. Lambert (1895), in his original description of the species, comments on the fact that
M. senonensis may have a rudimentary fasciole, although this appears to have escaped
the attention of Mortensen. The fascioles in the Spatangoidea are of great adaptive
significance, and, in the evolution of a stock, a sub-anal fasciole may easily disappear
under the influence of natural selection. This has happened in the evolution of
M. senonensis.
