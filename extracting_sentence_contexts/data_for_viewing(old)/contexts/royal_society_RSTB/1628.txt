obvious value of the second alternative lies in the fact that, while it may prove to be
a method of adjustinent even more rapid than the first, it also possesses the con-
tingent economical advantage that as no gas has been lost by mechanical liberation,
there will be no demand on the activity of the walls of the air-bladder for the
seoretion of additional gas when the Fish returns to a deeper level and greater
-prasure. On this view the processes of pressure adjustunent will not consist in the
actual expulsion of gas and its subsequent slow replacement by secretion, but rather
a the volumetric changes of a fairly constant quantity of gas, which are affeeted by
Vie uction of the ‘elastic spring” apparatus, and are always of the opposite character
these which the external hydrostatic pressure tends to produce. Of the two
ternatives the second seems to us the more feasible, but experiment alone can
determine the accuracy of either, while it my prove the falsity of both,
