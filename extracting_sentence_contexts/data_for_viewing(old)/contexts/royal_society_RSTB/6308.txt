VIIâ€”Oestrous CycLe

a. Dioestrous Cycle

The histological changes in the reproductive organs during the oestrous cycle are
so similar to those of the white mouse and the rat that they do not require detailed
description. It will be sufficient for the purposes of this paper to refer to, and figure,
the more characteristic phases for comparison with those of the mouse. The
oestrous cycle does differ, however, from that of the white mouse in several ways,
probably all connected with the fact that Evotomys is a wild species with a restricted
breeding season, whereas the white mouse is semi-domesticated and has a continuous
breeding season.

The majority of females undergo, at th: beginning of the breeding season in
April and May, a number of sterile cycles, accompanied by ovulation, before they
become pregnant. They resemble in this respect the Hedgehog in which Dranesty

(1934) has recorded the occurrence of a number of sterile dioestrous cycles accom-
panied by ovulation. This is shown by the presence in the ovaries of several distinct
