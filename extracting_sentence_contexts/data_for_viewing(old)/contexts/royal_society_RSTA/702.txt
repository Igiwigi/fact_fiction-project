of hematite at around 294 and 408cmâ„¢!, the low signal to noise ratio makes the identification
challenging. The application of helium led to an increase of the signal to noise ratio and four
hematite bands are clearly observed at 230, 294, 408 and 606 cm.

Besides the fact that a helium jet protects the object from heating damage, the reduction of
the luminescence background on the Raman spectra is a very desirable side effect. No clear
explanation has yet been formulated to explain this reduction in luminescence background. Two
processes have been proposed. The first one is that helium creates an inert atmosphere, avoiding
sample combustion together with its associated light emission. The second one is that helium
cools the analysed surface, reducing the production of fluorescent species from combustion,
reductive and oxidative processes, laser-induced degradation or photochemical reactions [20].
Asphalt (Y4-10), cochineal (Y4-14), indigo (Y4-20) and carbon black (Y4-24) were other pigments
that suffered laser-induced damages.

An additional remark is needed regarding the raw materials used to prepare the reference
panel. Although all the pigments and dyes were acquired from well-known manufacturers and
distributors of artistic materials, we cannot be completely certain of their composition, as they
