It is here that we are reminded of Umberto Eco’s echoes of intertextuality. Hazard studies
need to be considered in fairly broad context, and include the author’s personal experiences
in the interpretation of the results. How can someone who has not walked on flooded lands,
compared the inundation between adjacent beaches, wondered why a single structure was left
standing while all others were flattened, debated whether a debris mark on a surviving tree was
from the tsunami or carried by the wind, and listened to sometimes widely different eyewitness
accounts for the same location, how can he interpret a historic report, or understand what real
difference a change in grid resolution can make, or ultimately put his flooding prediction in the
proper context.

In our view, all energy and engineering companies prefer realistic answers and realize that
public safety is to the organizations’ best interest. Most are cognizant of the fact that an ounce
of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Yet, sometimes, industry consultants, because of lack
of experience, imagine that their clients prefer the ‘good’ news of lower estimates, and do not
check and re-check and check again their analyses. Regulators are sometimes more comfortable
with people they know than people they don’t, ignoring the additional perspective that people
thinking outside their insular boxes can introduce. To wit, even post Fukushima, the current US
practice appears to reflect diminishing regard for anything not invented by consultants of utilities
and of regulators, to paraphrase the National Diet of Japan’s [40] finding.

What regulators and the industry need are guidelines for assessing the experience and training
of their engineers, their consultants and of the reviewers of their reports, just as they have long
realized they need guidelines for the training of plant operators.
