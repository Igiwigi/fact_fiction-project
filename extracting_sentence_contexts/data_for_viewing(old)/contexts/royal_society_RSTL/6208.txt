in Tables 74, 75, 76, and T7 of the present memoir. These four Tables embrace the
former results, and the new ones which relate to the covariants CU, DU ; and they are
what is most important in the present memoir. I have, however, excluded from the
Tables, and I do not in the memoir consider (otherwise than incidentally) the covariant
of the 8ixth order OU, or the contravariant (reciprocant) FU.

I have given in the memoir a comparison of my notation with that of M. AroxnoLy.
A $hort part of the memoir relates to the binary cubic and the binary quartic, viz. each
of these quantics has a covariant of its own order, forming with it an intermediate
zU+PW, the covariants whereof contain quantics in (&, 3), the coefficients of which are
invariants of the original quantic. The formulz which relate to these cases are in fact
given in my Fifth Memoir, but they are reproduced here in order to show the relations
between the quantics in (&, 3) contained in the formule. As regards the binary quartic,
these results are required for the discussion of the like question in regard to the ternary
cubic, viz. that of finding the relations between the different quantics in («, 8) contained
in the formule relating to the ternary cubic. Some of these relations have been
obtained by M. HermiTe in the memoir © Sur les formes cubiques & trois ind6terminGes,”
(Liouville, t. iii. pp. 37-40 (1858), and in that © Sur la Resolution des 6quations du qua-
trieme degr6,” Comptes Rendus, xlvi. p. 715 (1858), and by M. ARoNHoOLD in his memoir
already referred to; and in particular I reproduce and demonstrate some of the results
in the last-mentioned memoir of M. Herwire. But the relations in question are in the
present memoir exhibited in a more complete and systematic form.
