What significance should be attached to such resemblances? It should be noted
that they are similar to those already recorded for the Pteridosperm Conostoma and for
Bennettites, but here we have a closer similarity in the structure of the micropylar tube. Such facts seem to point rather to common ancestry and parallel evolution than to
close relationship. The cutinisation of the micropylar tube found in Caytonia,
Bennettites and Gnetum is probably the outcome of a similar physiological mechanism
in the three genera. The comparison of the antherophores of Ephedra may be a more
important point, and again suggests the possibility of the derivation of the Caytoniales
and Gnetales from a common Pteridospermous ancestor somewhat like Crossotheca.
