part, of the vagus function is to reduce the work done by the heart in the interest of
the heart itself.

We conclude, then that the vagus acts as a protecting nerve to the heart, reducing
the work thrown upon that organ when, from fatigue or other causes, such relief is
required by it. The fact, however, that there exist centripetal fibres which call the
vagus centre into activity, in such nerves as the sciatic and splanchnic, shows that
the vagus mechanism may be called upon to act in the interests of other parts of the
