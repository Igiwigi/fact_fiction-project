Figure 2. Model selection naturally guards against overfitting with small sample sizes since the lack of information content favours simple models. By contrast, the
SPDs suggest interesting population dynamics that in fact are merely the artefacts of small sample sizes and calibration wiggles. (a) The best model (red) selected
