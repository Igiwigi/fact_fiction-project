Placentation.—Only in one section is there any sign of the actual attachment of
the ovules. This is in slide 3 YA where, as seen in Phot. 60, Plate 9, two points of
attachment are clearly seen in each carpel, apparently at about the same horizontal
level, so that it appears that the ovules were in two rows along the axile
placentation.

Unfortunately of the ovules themselves no tissueremains, A brownish mass, like
a crumpled membrane, in some of the carpels may possibly be interpreted as the coat
of an ovule.

Foliar Structure presumably Perianth.—The attachment of the foliar structures to
the carpels in slide 1 YA establishes the fact that they belong to the carpels we have
just described, a fact which their relative position in slide 1 YA (seen in Phots. 58 and
59) would leave little room to doubt. In these two slides only are any such tissues
preserved,

Whether the foliar structure represents a single bract or part of the fused tube of
a perianth, it is impossible to determine absolutely from these specimens, but in its
anatomy, so far as it is preserved, there is no indication of compound origin,
