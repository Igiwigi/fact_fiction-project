of them to that'science, to have the kindness to join with me in
the investigation I had undertaken. The Royal Society will
* perceive, in the detail given by Mr. Cuexevix himself, of the
analyses which he has made, not only of the different varieties |
of corundum, but also of the substances which accompany this
stone in its matrix, how very satisfactory to science are the
results of those analyses; insomuch, that I can now offer to the
Society, as one of the best established truths, what, in the year
1798, I mentioned merely as a suspicion which had great pro-
bability in its favour; and can also, in consequence of the
particular study I have made of all the varieties of stones
that Ihave here joined together, under the general denomi-
nation of corundum, present to the Society a collection of facts,
for the most part unknown, which, altogether, may be considered
as forming a mineralogical history of this substance.

Although the epithet oriental has been for a long time used
by the lapidaries, to express, in gems. or precious stones, a
degree of hardness superior to that. of other stones, (the
diamond excepted,) which made; them capable of taking a
more brilliant polish ; and although, following the example of
the lapidaries, naturalists had employed the same term by
way of distinguishing them, there still remained a great uncer-
tainty, respecting the nature of the analogy which really existed
between the various stones to which the above epithet was
