This was also described by myself as a neryous
structure, although subsequent examinations led me to suspect it was vascular, a
snspicion which afterwards was found to be correct, by the discovery by Mr. Lorp}
that this structure in the Scolopendra has a direct communication with the anterior
part of the dorsal vessel, by means of two lateral vascular arches, the continuations
of the two lateral divisions of the dorsal vessel observed by STRavs in the head of Sco-
lopendra. These arches, descending one on each side of the ces0phagus, and meeting
in the middle line beneath it, form this single median vascular trunk, which is ex-
tended backwards above the abdominal nervous cord. The facts ascertained by
Mr. Lonp were immediately confirmed by my own observations, and the correspond-
ing structure in the Scorpion was also shown to belong to the vascular system \, and
to form in like manner a vascular collar around the anterior part of the alimentary
canal. In addition to this vessel lying above the nervous cord, I then first described
another system of vessels extended beneath it, the chief of which, placed immediately
beneath the cord, communicates with the upper vessel, both anterior and posterior
to each ganglion, by means of very short branches, while the inferior one is also con-
nected with a system of yessels that ramify in the inferior part of the abdominal seg-
ments, I also noticed the existence of a large vascular trunk that is extended along
the abdominal cord in perfect Lepidopterous insects, 80 that distinct vascular trunks
were thus shown to exist in Myriapoda, Arachnida, and Insecta, similar to those
already known in the Crustacea. Since that period I bave succeeded in tracing other
vessels in these classes, the distribution of which, and their connexion with the ner-
vous system, I will now attempt to describe.
