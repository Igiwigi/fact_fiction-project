Future observations
E must determine more satisfactorily the state of the pulmonary
- organs, according to the impregnation of the air with sooty
= vapours. If, hereafter, it be $<hewn, that the lungs of persons
E living remote from sources of such vapours, are $till greatly
E- impregnated with coaly matter, the just conclusion can only be,
Z that such matter is more extensively diffused through the atmo-
<2 sphere, than is apprehended. This being the fact, it would also
S afford a proof that it is only the invisibly small particles which
Z are absorbed, for the larger particles remain unabsorbed,
V entangled in the mucus lining the air vessels, and never get
= farther, but are rejected from time to time by expectoration,
[5 Accordingly, in a morning, healthy people, after the night's
E rest, very commonly hawk up mucous matter of a bluish colour
£ with black streaks, owing to charcoal; and persons in a diseased
3 state, especially by great exertions in coughing, frequently ex-
S pectorate matter spotted and streaked with black particles. The
5 quantity of coaly matter in the pulmonary organs is not entirely
[= according to the age, for I was disappointed, on finding the

lungs and glands in a woman of seventy-five years of age, in
London, not more deeply coloured, than is usual at the age of
fiſty. At present, I am unable to state any connection between
certain diseases, and the'presence of coaly matter.
