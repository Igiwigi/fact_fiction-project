allogrooming from nest-mates towards pathogen-exposed
individuals [24,38,40,47—50]. Such diversity in allogrooming
is expected owing to the diversity of host—pathogen systems
studied, as both the infectiousness of pathogens and the
expressed collective defences may reach a different balance
in each system. This can be due to species- or strain-derived
differences in pathogenicity [54,65,66], dosage dependence
of infection risk after exposure [21,40], or different expression
or efficiency of host sanitary actions [51,52,54,66]. Note that a
reduction in allogrooming from nest-mates to exposed indi-
viduals has not yet been reported in any previous study.
Assuming that this is not an effect of publication bias, it
might be due to the fact that ant societies either rarely face
highly infectious pathogens or that their social defences, par-
ticularly allogrooming, are extremely efficient in reducing
disease spread in the colony. The latter is supported by the
vast literature on social immunity (reviewed in [2,67,68])
and the fact that allogrooming is largely universal among
eusocial insects (ants [5,24,25,32,38,40,47-50]; bees [67-70];
wasps [71]; termites [21,51,52,54,72]) and in other complex
societies (e.g. primates and meerkats [10,19]).
