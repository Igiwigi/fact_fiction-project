Mouriate of potassa, (/potassane) is a perfectly neutral

body.z. and when. six proportions of oxygene are added to
it, jt still remains neutral. Muriatic acid ( chlorine and hydro-


on the salts usually called hyper-oxymuriates, &c. 219

gene) is a strong acid; and according to the relation above
stated, it ought not to lose its acid powers by the addition of
six proportions of oxygene, Till a pure combination of chlo-
rine and oxygene is obtained, possessed of acid properties,
we have. no right to. say that chlorine is capable of being
acidified by oxygene, and that an acid compound exists in the
hyper-oxymuriates. We: know that chlorine is capable of
being converted into an acid by hydrogene, and, as I men-
tioned in my last paper, where this principle exists its energies
ought not to be overlooked; and all the new facts confirm an
opinion which I have more than once before submitted to the
consideration of the Society, namely, that acidity does not
depend upon any pecutiar elementary substance, but upon

peculiar combinations of various substances. Rome, Feb, 15, 1815. Nors.
