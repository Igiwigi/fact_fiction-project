From this opinion, which I long held unquestioningly, and to which I have often
referred, observation alone inclines me in some measure to dissent. I have scrutinized
numerous specimens of the livers of our ordinary domestic animals with a view to
determine this point, and still cannot convince myself that bile is present in the
parenchymal cells as @ normal and necessary condition. If present, it, ought not to be
very difficult of detection, seeing that it is a coloured fluid, and that the cell which
contains it is in this class generally provided with a distinct envelope: it ought, in
fact, to be as apparent, or nearly 80, as it is in the cells of the follicular livers of Mol-
lusea. But this is not the case; according to my observation the cells commonly
appear as pale granulous nucleated particles, with a more or less distinct limiting
envelope, and presenting a few or perhaps numerous and large oil-drops amid the soft
albuminous mass. Not unfrequently a distinct yellow fluid is seen infiltrating the
granulous contents, or several yellow highly refracting drops are observed in the
same situation ; this indicates of course that bile is present in such particles, but they
are seldom seen except when the liver is in a state of s0-called biliary congestion.
