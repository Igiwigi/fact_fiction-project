However, for unimpaired speakers who have mastered a common language,
talking to each other is—most of the time—straightforward [1]. But the phe-
nomenological easiness of dialogue contrasts with the amount of control it
requires to run smoothly. In fact, shared control allows speakers to guide the
conversation toward mutual understanding. Speakers reach mutual understanding when their understanding is aligned—
that is, when they focus on the same aspects of the world and conceptualize them
in the same way. Interlocutors do not reach alignment in isolation, but through
interaction, by manipulating each other's contributions, in a collaborative fashion.
