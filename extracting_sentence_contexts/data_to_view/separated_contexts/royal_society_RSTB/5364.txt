nerve, but also to the thick, stumpy nature of both pterygoid cartilage (of Sorex) and
pterygoid bone (of Lacerta). I therefore come to the conclusion that the pterygoid
cartilage of the mammal and consequently the dermal bone which subsequently
ossifies in this secondary cartilage, is homologous with the pterygoid bone of reptiles. This view is borne out further by the fact, emphasised by Fucus (1910) that the
pterygoid muscles have similar relations to these structures in reptiles and mammals. This conclusion, which is now supported by tangible evidence, throws open the whole
question of the homology of the pterygoids of monotremes, reptiles, and mammals, which
has been thrown into utter confusion ever since GAupp (1908) described two “ pterygoid ””
bones on each side in Echidna. He observed that the more ventral of these bones in
Echidna—the “ Echidna-pterygoid ’’—bore the relations of the pterygoid of the
reptile (which, in order to avoid confusion, I will refer to as the “ rep. pterygoid”),
while the more dorsal bone of Echidna, the “ Siiugerpterygoid,” corresponded to the
