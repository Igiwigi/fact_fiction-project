The average of the means of these four series of experiments, 0-436, 0-432, 0-431,
0-425, gives 0431 as the specific heat of the coal-tar naphtha A between 14” and 52*;
this value is taken in calculating the experiments in the following section.

28. If it were only a question as to the determination of the specific heat of this
naphtha, the method described in the preceding might be advantageously replaced by
another. For by this method the specific heat of the liquid must be found somewhat
too great, owing to the fact that in the empty space in the glass under the stopper a dis-
tinct quantity of yapour is formed, which condenses when the glass is dipped in the
water of the calorimeter (compare ( 25). Direct experiments, in which this forma-
tion of vapour was almost entirely avoided, have shown that the method used for the
previous determinations, that is, the use of glasses for heating the liquid in which a

heat of liquid compounds) had a narrow neck, and was filled 80 that there was very little space in which
