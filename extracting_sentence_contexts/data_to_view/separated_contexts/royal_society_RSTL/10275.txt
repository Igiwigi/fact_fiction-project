The case of the genus Todea should be mentioned as exceptional, while Todea barbara has wings
consisting of about nine layers of cells, Todea superba has wings with only one or two layers, it thus

Cycadacee, and there is no apparent objection on other grounds to thinking that these
plants constitute a natural series ; in other words, that they indicate, at least roughly,
a line of natural descent. Tf this be 80 we are confronted by a remarkable fact. It

there is all the difference in the reproductive organs between the characteristic free
prothallus and antherozoid of the Vascular Cryptogams, and the endosperm and pollen-
tube of the Gymnosperms.
