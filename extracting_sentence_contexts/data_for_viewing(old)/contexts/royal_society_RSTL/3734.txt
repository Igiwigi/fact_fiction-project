reversion either of the current in the helix or of the polarity of the cores arrested the
motion ; approach was converted into recession and recession into approach.

The ends of the helix in these experiments were not far from the ends of the soft
iron cores; and it might therefore be snpposed that the action was due to some modi-
fication of the cores by the helix, or of the helix by the cores. It is manifest that the
magnets can have no permanent effect upon the helix ; the current through the latter,
measured by a tangent galvanometer, is just as strong when the cores are excited as
when they are unexcited. The helix may certainly have an effect upon the cores, and
this effect is either to enfeeble the magnetism of the cores or to strengthen it ; but if
the former, and the bar were the simple bismuth which it is when no current operates
on it, the action, though weakened, would still be repulsive, and if the latter, the increase
would simply augment the repulsion. The fact, however, of the ends of the bar being
attracted, proves that the bar has been thrown into a peculiar condition by the current,
circulating in the surrounding coil. Changing the direction of the current in the coil,
we find that the self-8ame magnetic forces which were formerly attractive are now
repulsive; to produce this effect the condition of the bar must have changed with
the change of the current; or, in other words, the bar is capable of accepting #0
different states of excitement, which depend upon the direction of the current.

In order, however, to reduce as far as possible the action of the helix upon the
cores, I repeated the experiments with the small helix referred to in fig. 6, page 25. It
will be remembered that this helix is but an inch in length, and that the bismuth bar
is 6} inches long. I removed the magnets further apart, so that the centres of the cores
were half an inch beyond the ends of the bisxmuth bar, while the helix encircled only
