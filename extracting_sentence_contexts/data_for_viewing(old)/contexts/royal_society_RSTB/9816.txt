Figure 4. Single gene mutations cause changes in mammalian gait. (a) When trotting, the legs on the same side move in opposite directions. (b) When pacing,
ipsilateral legs move in the same direction. Icelandic horses homozygous for a nonsense mutation in the DMRT3 gene naturally pace. (c) In typical fictive locomotion
from a neonatal mouse spinal cord, regular rhythmic activity occurs in the left (I) and right (r) lumber (L) roots from spinal ventral roots 2 and 5. (d) In mice lacking
Dmrt3 expression, the fictive motor pattern is irregular. (e) Neurons expressing the ephrin receptor A4 (EphA4, black) normally are repelled by the ephrin ligand B3
(EphrinB3, dark grey). In EphA4 knock-out mice, these neurons can cross the midline. (f) Schematic of the fictive motor pattern from a wild-type mouse shows
normal left-right alternation. (g) In EphA4 knockout mice, left and right flexors burst synchronously and out of phase with extensors, producing a hopping gait.
