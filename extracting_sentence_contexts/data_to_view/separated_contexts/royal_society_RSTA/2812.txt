Remark 3.5. Observe that it is extremely important that @ is strictly convex. In fact, Mather [25]
proved the non-existence of caustics if the curvature of the boundary vanishes at one point. An
alternative proof of this result has been provided by Gutkin & Katok [26], where the authors
also investigate how the shape of the domain determines the location of caustics, establishing the
existence of open regions which are free of caustics and estimating (from below) the size of these
regions. The next step consists then in asking in which cases these caustics foliate the whole billiard
table or an open dense subset of it, as it happens in the circular and elliptic cases.
