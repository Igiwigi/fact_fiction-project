The troughs were at 4300, 4850, 5800 and 6150A;; the crests were at 4550,
5300 and 6050A. The general level of acuity is higher in the yellow-green than it is else-
where. None of these facts is easy to account for on the three-colour theory. With three
crests and four troughs there must be five different receptors distributed throughout the
spectrum. But, as Granit has pointed out (1945), additional receptors would probably be

required in the green and in the yellow regions of the spectrum, in order to provide the
