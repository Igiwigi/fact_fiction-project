together morphologically give carbon balance sheets of entirely different types and are
obviously not very closely related biochemically. In these cases it is possible that
subsequent alteration in the morphological classification will bring our findings more
into line with THom’s classification since he himself admits that some species of
Penicillium are grouped together in his book on somewhat arbitrary lines. We have,
indeed, found that certain strains of Penicillium, admittedly of the same species, may
give rise to large amounts of aleohol, while other strains of the same species produce
none of this metabolic product. An example of this is given in Group X, where of
two strains of P. lilacinum Tuo, obtained from different parts of the world, one strain
gives 12 per cent. of alcohol and the other strain gives scarcely any. In other respects
their carbon balance sheets are very similar. Another instance is given in Part Il
for different strains of A. nidulans Epa. We have at present no explanation to offer for
what is undoubtedly a very definite biochemical fact, since it must be remembered that
in all of these experiments identical cultural conditions were followed. On the other
hand there are several instances in which different strains of the same species of
Penicillium, obtained from different parts of the world, give carbon balance sheets
which are almost indistinguishable from one another. Notable examples of
these are to be found in Table II for five different strains of P. (Citromyces)
glabrum Wexner, and in Table XID for three different strains of Scopulariopsis
brevicaulis (Sacc.) BAINTER.

Tt may be well to summarize the results given in this paper by dealing in turn with
the outstanding items in the carbon balance sheets.

I. Growth.—It may be said that in general the majority of the species of Penicillium
