is continuous. This point is also observed in the numerical simulations in §3. The velocity of the
propagating front of the tumour is given by the equation satisfied by the density (1.13). Because
the pressure is discontinuous, it has weaker regularity than in the inviscid case treated in [8,9],
and we need to develop a new strategy of proof to derive the incompressible limit. Our approach
is based on a kinetic formulation of the equation satisfied by the pressure.

This work also opens several additional questions. First, the case with general initial data is
not treated here because we assume that n° vanishes outside 2°. Then, it would be interesting
to consider the case with active motion as in [9]. In such a case, equation (1.2) is replaced by a
parabolic equation. Then, the structure of the problem is different but the limiting system should
be the same, except the equation for the density, which implies a faster propagation of the region
Q(t). Moreover, it is formally clear from (1.10) and (1.11) that, letting v > 0, we recover the Hele-
Shaw system. However, a rigorous proof of this fact requires compactness of the sequence which
was not directly available with the method developed here. Finally, uniqueness for the limit
problem is still open.
