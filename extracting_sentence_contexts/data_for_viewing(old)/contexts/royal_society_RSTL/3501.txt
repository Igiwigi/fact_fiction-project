table both the direction and the amount of the contact force.

1809. It is assumed by the supporters of the contact theory, that though the me-
tals exert strong electromotive forces at their points of contact with each other, yet
these are 80 balanced in a metallic circuit that no current is ever produced whatever
their arrangement may be. So in Plate III. fig. 1. if the contact force of copper and zinc
is 10 —>, and a third metal be introduced at m, the effect of its contacts, whatever
that metal may be, with the zinc and copper at b and c, will be an amount of force
in the opposite direction = 10. Thus, if it were potassium, its contact force at
b might be 5——, but then its contact force at c would be <— 15: or if it. were
gold, its contact force at b might be <—— 19, but then its contact force at c would be
9——=. This is a very large as8umption, and that the theory may agree with the
facts is necessary : $till it is, I believe, only an assumption, for I am not aware of any
data, independent of the theory in question, which prove its truth.

1810. On the other hand, it is assumed that fluid conductors, and such bodies as
contain water, or, in a word, those which I have called electrolytes (664. 823. 921.),
either exert no contact force at their place of contact with the metals, or if they do
exert such a power, then it is with this most important difference, that the forces are
not sbject to the same law of compensation or neutralization in the complete circuit,
as holds with the metals (1809.). But this, I think I am justified in saying, is an as-
