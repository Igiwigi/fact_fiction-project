The red lymphatics form capacious sinuses associated mainly with the skin and gills
with extensions to various parts of the head and to the mucous membrane of the
pharynx and cesophagus. This lacunar system is in direct continuity on the one hand
with the arterial system through branches of the carotid arteries and through curious
perforated papille distributed along the respiratory blood vessels, and on the other
hand with the venous system through valved openings. It contains blood in greater
or less quantity that enters it directly through its arterial tributaries. The white
lymphatics are apparently fully differentiated lymphatics without blood contents or
arterial connections. They contain lymph only and derive important factors from
the viscera.

Tf, as I am assuming from the facts observed in Teleosteans, the lymphatic system
took its origin in the specialization of a part of the blood-vascular system that included
both arteries and veins, the condition that one might expect to find at the commencement
of this specialization would be something similar to what Coxe describes in the red
lymphatics of Myxine.

Probably an important factor in calling forth the lymphatic system was the necessity
for an improved means for the conveyance of extraneous fluid from the periphery to
the centre, either fluid of the surrounding medium transfused through the skin and the
mucous membrane of the mouth and pharynx, or food material absorbed by the
alimentary canal. The vessels most readily adaptable for this purely centripetal
circulation would be the veins. One would thus expect to find in the earlier stages of this
evolutionary process signs of modification in some of the veins, such as those of the skin,
