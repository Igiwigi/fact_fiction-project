publiſhed on the 25th of February
1758, in page 185, is the following article : © We
« hear, that about two o'clock in the morning of
&© the 24th of laſt month” (which was the month
of January), © an Earthquake was felt in the pa-
* riſhes of Worthe, and Eaſt-Grinſted, in Suſſex ;
« Lingfield, in Surrey; and Edenbridge, in Kent;
« and other adjacent places: which alarmed ſeveral
of the inhabitants very much ; but no damage

« like a ſmall guſt of wind.” However, Mr, Burrow did not then judge it to be
either regular or proper to trouble the Society with
this account ; becauſe Mr. Goodricke only received
it from hearſay and report, he himſelf happening to
be abſent from Lingfield at that time. But Mr. Burrow having paſſed ſome days, during
the late receſs of the Society, at a place called Star-
borough-caſtle, which lies nearly b:#wwveen the two
churches of Lingfield and Edenbridge (ſcarce four
miles diſtant from each other), he has had an oppor-
tunity of being more particularly and circumſtan-
tially informed of the fact, as far as relates to thoſe
two pariſhes : and he is now aſſured, that it was cer-
tainly and undoubtedly felt and obſerved by ſome
perſons in each of thoſe two.
