nitrobenzol to distillation with carbonate of sodium. These two bodies differ likewise
most characteristically ; « nitrochlorobenzol crystallizes invariably in long, almost white
needles which fuse at 83? C., whilst Þ nitrochlorobenzol crystallizes from its ethereal
solution in thick columns which fuse at 469 C. The former is converted by sulphide of
ammonium into the ordinary («) chloraniline, the latter into a new base ( chloraniline),
which is distinguished by its remaining an oil at the common temperature. The plati-
num-salt presents itself in the form of yellow crystals, which differ likewise considerably
in form and solubility from the 8mall slender plates of the platinum-salt of « bromaniline.


714 MR. P. GRIESS ON A NEW SERIES OF BODIES IN

It may, I think, be safely deduced from these facts that two distinctly different series of
compounds are obtained by the substitution of two atoms of hydrogen in benzol by two
different elements, or groups of atoms, according as this substitution is accomplished,
and that these two series differ most distinctly in their physical properties, although their
chemical composition is the same. The great differences between the fusing-points
form one of the most important means of distinction between the members of the two
series. The fusing-points of series « lie considerably higher than those of the P series;
sometimes a difference of 70* C. is observable, as will be seen by the accompanying Table.
