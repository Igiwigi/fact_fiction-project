the fact that energetic particles, such as cosmic rays,
create H3t and that an enhanced abundance of H3~
causes dramatic changes on the overall gas chemical
composition, we can indirectly estimate the flux
of energetic particles. This contribution provides
an overview of the search for solar-like protostars
