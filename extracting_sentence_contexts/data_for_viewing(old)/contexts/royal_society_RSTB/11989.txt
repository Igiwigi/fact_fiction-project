ing precursors of the let-7 miRNA family. These miRNAs are
involved in cell differentiation and deregulated in cancer
development (reviewed in [154,155]). In non-differentiated
cells the LIN28a protein is expressed. It specifically binds


miRNA precursors and a TUTase, promoting processive oli-
gouridylation of the precursor miRNA, which ultimately
precludes its processing by DICER and leads to degradation
of the oligouridylated pre-let-7 [156-163]. In contrast to that,
in differentiated cells LIN28a is not expressed [42,164]. In its
absence, TUT4/7 add prevalently just a single uridine to the
3’ end of the pre-let-7 RNAs. In fact, miRNA precursors fall
into two families regarding their 3! end: it is either a 2-nucleo-
tide 3’ overhang (group I of prototypical pre-miRNA) or just a
single nucleotide 3’ overhang (group II). Since DICER requires
a 2-nucleotide 3’ overhang for processing of the pre-miRNA
into mature miRNA, group II pre-miRNA comprising a
majority of let-7 family RNAs cannot be processed [42]. How-
ever, once monouridylated, the group II pre-miRNAs are
conveyed to the later steps of their maturation [42,43]. Thus, a
single protein LIN28a provides a crucial discriminatory mech-
anism for either oligo- or monouridylation and _ their
respective effects in blocking or promoting microRNA matu-
ration. Small molecules inhibiting LIN28a-pre-let-7 interactions
