ther hand we have used films much thinner than those employed by him, or by Vax

ER MENSBRUGGHE in his confirmatory observations.

S We mnust admit, however, that we are unwilling to draw any such conclusion until
Sn explanation of the discontinnity in the thickness at the edge of the black is forth-
Poming, which is nob incompatible with it. The regular recurrence of that pheno-
Inonon suggests that it must in 8ome way be connected with the extreme tenuity of

:Fhe film on one side of it. We thought it well thab PLaTeav's method should be
Spushed (as we venture to think we have pushed it) beyond the point where he and

AN DER MENSBRUGGHE left ib, but the fact that it has led to a negative result does
-Hot diminish the significance of the sharp edge of the black.

3 As far as we are aware, no suggestion has yet been made as to the cause of the
Aiscontinuity. We have necessarily had our attention directed to it, and, though our
Wiews are at present little more than speculations, yeb it may perhaps conduce to a
Auxoful discussion if we suggest a cause which might, we think, furnish a satisfactory

lation of the difficulty.
