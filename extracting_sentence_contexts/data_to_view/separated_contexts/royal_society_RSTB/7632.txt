Damage to the parietal cortex in humans, in parti-
cular to the right parietal cortex, results in a neglect of the contralateral half of space. This neglect syndrome affects
all modalities and is therefore considered to be a spatial deficit rather than a sensory one. The fact that the neglected
region of space travels with the movements of the observer has suggested to many that the spatial framework
egocentric one with its origin on a receptor or body axis. Attempts to identify the framework with particular
receptor or body parts, such as the head or trunk, have met with mixed success. For example, when head and
trunk axes were dissociated by requiring the patient to turn the head to the right (see, for example, Bisiach ef al.
1985; Karnath et al. 1993) neglect for stimuli occurred on the left side in both frameworks.
