Ultrastructural
changes are slow, and we assume that the changes that we
observed are the net result of several NREM/REM cycles. It
is unlikely that a single episode of NREM sleep, or of REM
sleep, which in mice lasts only a few minutes, will have a
net effect on the ultrastructure, although it may be enough
to affect the expression of AMPA receptors on the surface
of the spine head. In fact, an important question for the
future will be to understand how sleep and waking affect
synapses and, as a consequence, memory, cumulatively,
over several days, and whether such cumulative effects may
be critical for the integration of new with old memories. Data accessibility. This article does not contain any additional data.
