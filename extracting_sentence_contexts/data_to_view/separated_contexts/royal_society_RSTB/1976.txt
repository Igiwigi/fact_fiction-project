The alcohol sections give
pronounced colorations with the Â«-naphthol and orcin tests, A drop of the naphthol
solution is put on the section, and then a couple of drops of sulphuric acid added,
when almost immediately a deep violet colour spreads all over it. With orcin the
coloration appears in a similar way as a deep orange-brown. After steeping the
sections in cold water, they no longer respond to the tests, and the precipitate has
disappeared from the cells; this agrees with the fact that the prepared inulin from
the bulb is soluble in cold water. Thus the evidence that the substance deposited in
the cells by the spirit is the inulin is fairly conclusive. The abundant mucilage of
the numerous raphide-cells may interfere with a clear view of the behaviour of the
inulin, since in water it does not at once dissolve, but swells up, and is apt to
obliterate the view of the parenchymatous cells.
