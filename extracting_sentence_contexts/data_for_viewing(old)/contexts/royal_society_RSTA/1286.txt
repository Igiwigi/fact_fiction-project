(c) Effective material approach to cell membranes

Living cells consist of cytoplasm surrounded by a membrane wall that comprises a double layer of
phospholipids, the underlying spectrin network and transmembrane proteins; the membranes are
commonly modelled as an incompressible effective material [21]. It is often argued that the RBC
membrane may be easily deformed keeping the constant area [45,46], hence, it was suggested
to model the membranes as a two-dimensional incompressible material. On the other hand, it
was stated that the RBC modelled as a nonlinear elastic membrane filled with an incompressible
fluid [46]. In fact, the internal space of the cell is not just fluid, but a kind of a fibrous composite
material containing some fibres specialized to withstand tension and the others specialized in
withstanding compression, i.e. it has a hierarchical molecular structure that is stabilized based on
tensegrity principles [47]. Very simple geometrical estimations show that the assumption of two-
dimensional incompressible material in application to all cell membranes is not correct. Indeed,
let the initial cell shape be spherical of diameter D (radius R = D/2) and the cell be fully filled by
the fluid. After complete aspiration of the cell by a micropipette of the internal diameter d (radius
r=d/2) the cell shape can be described as a cylinder of some length L and radius r having two
semi-spherical caps of radius r. If one denotes the ratios m = R/r and n = L/r then the ratios of the
initial volume V; of a cell and its surface area A; to the final values Vy and Ay of the volume and
surface are, respectively
