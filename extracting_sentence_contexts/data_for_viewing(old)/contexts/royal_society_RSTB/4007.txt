characters is never so complete asin the pure forms. In the cross 2. acutus
or E. esculentus? Xx HE. miliaris $, when the inheritance was maternal, as in the
years 1909-11, the presence of posterior epaulettes and posterior pedicellarize was
never so well marked as in the parent forms of H. aecutus and E. esculentus. In
addition, the appearance of these characters in the hybrids was to a certain extent
delayed, and their growth, after their first appearance, was slower than in the pure
species. This fact has also been noticed by Depatsteux (16). LANG (50) has
observed that in crossing snails, the rate of development of some of the characters
in the young hybrids is much slower than in the pure forms. In these experiments
Lane crossed Helix hortensis and H. nemoralis, where the parents are red and
yellow. In the F, generation he got a ratio of 3 yellow: 1 red, but as they grew
older this changed into a ratio of 3 red: 1 yellow. Moore (64) in a recent paper
has drawn attention to this fact with regard to the inheritance of skeleton characters
in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus % x S. franciscanus $. In all cases he found the
development of characters such as spinousness, length of arms, and body shape, was
much retarded in the hybrids. He suggests that, as only half the substance that
produces the characters in the pure forms is present in the hybrids, their development
will necessarily be much slower.

In 1912, the maternal inheritance which we had found in the previous three
seasons changed, in those crosses in which 2. miliaris was the female parent, to
paternal. (See Table on p. 308.) The effect of this was to give a dominance, in both
reciprocals of a cross alike, of the late larval characters of H. esculentus and HL. acutus
over those of E. miliaris. Whereas, however, in 1909-11 the larve in all cultures
showed the same inheritance, in 1912 the general rule just stated was occasionally
