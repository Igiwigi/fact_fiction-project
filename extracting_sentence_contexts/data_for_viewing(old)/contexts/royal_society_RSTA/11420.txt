This is probably the first determination of a coefticient of inheritance between a
Slatent character in one sex and a patent character in the other sex. We see that it
has almost exactly the value required (â€˜3) by the law of ancestral heredity, or we
conclude, mares inherit from their sires a fecundity governed closely by the law of
ancestral heredity.

If the reader asks why is not the intensity reduced in this case in the same
manner that we find it reduced in the case of the inheritance from the dam, the
reply is :

- (i) In the case of the dam and mare, both quantities to be correlated are liable to
fictitious values. In the case of sire and mare, we deal with only one.

* A fecundity unit is taken to be 1/15, for this is the unit of grouping.

(ii.) The influence of fictitious values has been shown on pp. 276-277 to chiefly
affect the coefficient of correlation and not the standard deviation.

Now the present result is based solely on the calculation of standard deviations,
or on the variability of fecundity as a whole and in arrays. It is accordingly not
influenced to nearly the same extent by the existence of fictitious values. Could we
