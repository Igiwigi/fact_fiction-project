Sub-sections Aâ€”C, PP- 484-497). \ The fact of the evolution of free Nitrogen during the decomposition of nitro-
mus organic matter has been confirmed by experiment ; but the circumstances of the
position in which the evolution of free Nitrogen was observed, when compared
those involved in an experiment on the question of assimilation, are not s8wch
to lead to the conclusion that there would be a loss of Nitrogen from this source in
xperiments of the latter kind, unless in certain exceptional cases, in which it might be
pposed (Section II. Sub-sectign D, pp. 497 -508).
