Major properties of the HPV E6 and E7 oncogenes.

oncogene property reference
E7 epigenetic reprogramming of cells by upregulation of KDM6A and KDM6B [25]
abrogation of pRb/E2F pathway by pRb degradation [47]
induction of DDR in differentiated cells to promote viral DNA amplification [48]
inhibition of innate immune response reviewed in [49]
E6 proteasome-mediated degradation of p53 [50]
induction of telomerase expression [51]
degradation of PDZ domain proteins involved in cell polarity reviewed in [52]
