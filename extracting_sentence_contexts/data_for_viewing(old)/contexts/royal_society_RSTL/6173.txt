vided chamber of the shell ; whilst in the case of Orbiculing each segment is subdivided
into sub-segments strung like the beads of a necklace on a continuous stolon of sarcode,
the chamber being correspondingly subdivided by transverse partitions having a con-
tinuous passage through all. The very close alliance of the two forms is shown by the
fact, that specimens are occasionally to be met with in collections of Orbiculine, which,
while presenting the general physiognomy of that genus, exhibit the deficiency of trans-
verse partitions which is the distinguishing character of Peneroplis; 80 as to render it
uncertain whether such specimens should be considered as Orbiculine in which (as
certainly happens occasionally in Orbitolites, | 61) the usual partitions are deficient, or
whether they truly belong to Peneroplis, their resemblance to Orbiculing being super-
ficial only, and their presence among specimens of that genus merely accidental. In
either case it is obvious that the affinity between these two types is very close; and in
fact young Orbicutine frequently present 8uch a strong external resemblance to Pene-
roplis, that their true nature cannot be determined without 8uch an examination of their
internal structure as will serve to disclose the transverse partitioning of their chambers.
It may be fairly inquired whether the peculiar striation of the surface of Peneroplis,
which 80 strongly suggests the idea of internal partitioning as to haye led MoNnTFORT to
assert its existence, is not really a rudiment of that structure.
