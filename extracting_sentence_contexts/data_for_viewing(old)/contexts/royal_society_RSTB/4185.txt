towards the reduction of the male sporophylls and the limitation of the area of
production of the megasporophylls.

These facts seem to further strengthen the solidity of the Bennettitalean group,
which is so remarkably uniform in the form and structure of its female reproductive
structures. ‘They are also of considerable theoretical interest, especially in connection
with the theories of the ‘‘ Bennettitalean ” ancestry of the Angiosperms. Arper and
Parxkin* and other exponents of this view postulated the gradual reduction of the
microsporophylls of their hypothetical Hemiangiosperm, and the observation of actual
reduction to microsporophylls, bearing as few as four synangia, in the parallel
Bennettitalean line may be considered as affording support to this view.

We must, however, remember that though in Williamsoniella a reduction in the
number of synangia has taken place, yet the pollen-grains are still produced in
synangia with very distinct septation, and that a sporophyll with two synangia
would still be very distinct from a- typical angiosperm stamen. It might, on the
