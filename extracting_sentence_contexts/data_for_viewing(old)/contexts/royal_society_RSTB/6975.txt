but of large specimens. It is not necessary to return here to the general question of
the possible terrestrial habitat of these plants, which was fully considered in relation
to the Downtonian flora (Lang 1937). It need only be pointed out that the presence
of Prototaxites in the Senni Beds affords strong additional support for regarding the
Nematophytales as land plants.

The desirability of further collecting and detailed work on all stages in the remarkable
and continuous succession of plant remains from the Silurian to the Senni Beds will
be evident. There is no advantage at present in entering upon the general questions
involved further than the remarks in the preceding paragraphs. What is needed is the
building up of our knowledge not only of the morphology and structure of the plants
but also of their modes of occurrence and probable habitats. The present paper is such
a contribution of fact regarding the plants of the Senni Beds.
