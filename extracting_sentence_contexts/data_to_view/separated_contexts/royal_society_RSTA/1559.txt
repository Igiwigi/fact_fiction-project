§13. A Reciprocal Theorem. We note that the harmonic (spheroidal) series for ¢/ is symmetrical in e/a and ¢,—
a fact not readily foreseen. ‘This gives us an interesting reciprocal property. On the
axis, where p= 1, 2=a%, or € =z/a. Consider two problems concerning the same
disc, one with a source at —c and the other with one at —c’.
