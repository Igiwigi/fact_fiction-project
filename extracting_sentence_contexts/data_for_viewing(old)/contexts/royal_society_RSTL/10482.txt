difficulties besetting this line of inquiry are many, but the greatest of them is the
difficulty of finding a reaction that is simple in kind, that takes place between bodies
which can be prepared in great purity, and that yields products which can be exactly
measured. Several methods of investigation have been pursued. The course of a gradual
change between two bodies has been followed step by step, either by measnring
the amount of residue till remaining undecomposed after successive equal inter-
vals of time, or by measuring the time required for the snccessive formation of equal
quantities of one of the products of the reaction. Such was the method employed by
BerTHELOT, who measured the rate of etherification of an alcohol by an acid, and
by Harcourr and E880N, who measured the rate of decomposition of hydric
peroxide by hydrie iodide. Unluckily but few of the reactions, which occur slowly
enough for such investigation, appear to be of a simple nature ; examination reveals
the fact that, in most cases, the change from the initial substances to the final product
does not take place in one stage, but is a complex reaction brought about by the
successive formation and decomposition of intermediate compounds ab rates which
severally vary with the conditions of the experiment.

Another method of investigation is that of comparing the rates of two opposite
changes taking place simultaneously in a homogeneous mixture. When two bodies
enter into double decompoxition to form two new bodies which are themselyes capable,
under the conditions of the experiment, of re-forming the original substances by a
reverse change, a mixture of the four bodies is produced, and an equilibrium is finally
established when the rate of decomposition of one pair of the reacting bodies is exactly
