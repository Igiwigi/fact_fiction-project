The bullets ſhould be made to fit the bore with very little
windage ; and it would be better if they were all caſt in the

' fame mould, and of the fame parcel of lead, as in that caſe
their weights and dimenſions would be more accurately the
ſame, and the experiments would of courſe be more concluſive. The ſtated charge of powder may be half an ounce, and it
ſhould always, be put up in a cartridge of very fine paper ; and
After the piece is loaded it ſhould be primed with other powder,
Firſt taking care to prick the cartridge by thruſting a priming
Avire down the vent. S As it appears, from ſeveral experiments made on purpoſe to
Sſcertain the faCt, that ramming the powder more or leſs has a
Sery ſenſible effe&t to increaſe or diminiſh the force of the
Eharge 3 ;.to prevent any inaccuracies that might ariſe from that
Saule, a tam-rod,. ſuch as is. repreſented fig. 15. may be made
Hſe of. It is to be made of a cylindric piece of wood m the
Jame manner as ram-rods in general are made,” but with the
Addition of a ring C, about one inch and a half, or two inches
&n diameter, which, being placed at a proper diſtance fron the”
Sud (a) of the ram-rod that goes up into the bore, will prevent. ;
Ms being thruſt up too far. This ring may be made-of wood,”
Hr of any, kind of metal as, ſhall. be found moſt convenient.
