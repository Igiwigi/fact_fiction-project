Duration of Vitality—The spermatozoa remain quiescent within the testes, but
are immediately stimulated to activity by sea-water, the activity being more intense
the greater the admixture of water. If so little water is used that the mixture looks
| white or milky, the spermatozoa will survive and be able to fertilise ova for two
days or longer. But if the dilution is very great the fertilising power becomes lost

in a few hours. Ova shredded out into sea-water have the best chance of developing
normally if fertilised within the first four hours. This chance is slightly diminished

' at six hours and much more so at eight and ten. Thereafter only very irregular
segmentations or cytolytic changes are induced by the addition of sperm. I am
indebted to one of my students, Mr. J. K. Rennie, for these facts, which may be
compared with the corresponding data worked out by me for Hchinus esculentus (26).


224 DR. J. F. GEMMILL ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND CERTAIN POINTS IN

Cross-fertilisation.—The following data from a set of cross-fertilisation experiments carried out by me
at the Millport Station in the spring of 1902 have reference to Asterias rubens :—

A. rubens, female A very large proportion of the ova segmented and went on to blastula and gastrula

A, glacialis, male formation. The converse crossing gave a similar result.
