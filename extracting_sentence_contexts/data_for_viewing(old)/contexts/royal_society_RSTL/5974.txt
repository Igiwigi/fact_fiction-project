be 8aid to exist in most, the generative products being merely developed from 80me part of
the walls of the perivisceral cavity into which they eventually freely float, making their
way out in a manner which is not quite understood at, present ; probably through some
temporary or permanent apertures at the bases of the parapodia.”

From. this passage it is obyious that by the most recent expounders of the science of
comparative anatomy, it is formally asserted that in the Annelida © special reproductive
organs can hardly be said to exist.” It will afterwards appear that the facts to be
related in this memoir conduct the anatomist to a widely different conclusion.

A brief and special historical introduction will be prefixed to each department of the
subject.

By this arrangement references to the researches of other observers will be much
facilitated.

The families of Annelids selected for examination will be placed in juxtaposition,
more on account of an affinity of type presented by the © segmental organ ” than in
deference to any other principle of classification.
