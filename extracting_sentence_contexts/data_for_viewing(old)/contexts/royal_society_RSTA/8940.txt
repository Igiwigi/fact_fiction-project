for », » Amongst Lewis’ lines a set was found with separations in the reverse
order, clearly pointing to a first set of —S(1) or +P (1) lines and corresponding sets
for other orders were then easily found. It would seem that there are always a
considerable number of separations governed by oun displacements in the limits of the
first order, and that of these, three seem to be of a more stable value and correspond
to normal triplets. For instance, in all these gases we find a very large number of
eases where a §, or D, line is followed by a line with a separation very close to $n.
They force themselves on attention on account of their value being so close to the
half of a number being sought for, and others may be present although they have
not been looked for. In the present case two alternative sets of lines for the
8; series, one with »,= 309 and the other with »= 341 appear. In the original
search the former was taken because it is reproduced in the D series as well. But
later certain difficulties in the determination of the oun, combined with the fact that
the corresponding oun multiple in A,, although quite definite, is out of step with the
march of their values in the other gases, led me to include the second. This gives
a multiple quite in step with the others, and also affords the means of obtaining
a good approximation to the oun,

The lines are given in the following table, which also embrace a few obtained by
sounding, both wave-lengths and wave-numbers are given :—
