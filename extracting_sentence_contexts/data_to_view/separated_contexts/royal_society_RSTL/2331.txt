This fact is sometimes illustrated in a magnificent manner during violent
irruptions of volcanic mountains. The air in the crater is highly rarified : and
during a thunder-storm, the lightning is observed to dart into the hollow
cone as if it were attracted by the flame, or by the mass of melted lava at the
bottom of the crater; whereas the true cause of the phaxnomenon. is found in the
ready passage which the partial vacuum affords to the electric fluid driven off
by its own repulsion from the charged cloud. It is a well-known fact that imperfect conductors become tolerably good
conductors when heated. Glass, for example, which is a very imperfect con-
ductor when cold, conducts the electric fluid very readily when heated red hot. This is indeed what we might naturally expect from what we have assigned
as the cause of conduction.
