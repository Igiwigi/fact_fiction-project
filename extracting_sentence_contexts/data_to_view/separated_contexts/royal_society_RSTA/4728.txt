Discussion

At non-zero mass, the above geometric descriptions develop an antisymmetric part of the
connection. In three dimensions, this antisymmetric part is standard torsion, whereas, in
higher dimensions, the interpretation becomes more involved. The fact that the longitudinal
degrees of freedom of the gauge bosons are encoded in non-symmetric components of the
connection remains. Standard Einstein-Hilbert gravity requires a symmetric connection and the metric is the
fundamental variable. These requirements are softened in Einstein—Cartan—-Sciama-Kibble theory
[22-27], where the metric and the torsion are independent degrees of freedom.
