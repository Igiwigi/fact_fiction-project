The common polymorph usually
encountered in everyday life is called hexagonal ice (ice I,). For some time, an alternative form
of ice, cubic ice (ice I), was thought to be a low-temperature modification coexisting with ice I,
at temperatures as high as 240 K [72]. However, recent studies [73] have concluded that in fact
previous observations are probably not this purely cubic form, but rather a mixture of cubic and
hexagonal stackings, called stacking-disordered ice, abbreviated (ice Iq) by Malkin et al. [74] and (ice
Icy) by Hansen et al. [75]. Whether or not this will be confirmed by additional studies, ice I, gives a
convenient boundary condition on the possible structures that could exist and we will proceed as
though ice I, is a possible metastable phase. Above 170K, ice I,q transforms irreversibly to ice I).
