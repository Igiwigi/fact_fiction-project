afford equally interesting and familiar examples of the permanent influence of
that function. Whilst the nervous connexion between the larynx and the me-
dulla oblongata is preserved entire, —in the rabbit (Lepus cuniculus), for exam-
ple,—the glottis is preserved open, being slightly dilated during each act of
inspiration; but if the snperior laryngeal nerves be divided, the aperture
immediately becomes 80 much diminished, that a state of excessive dyspncea
is induced. The sphincter ani, on the other hand, remains closed in the decapi-
tated turtle (Chelonia mydas), if the lower part of the medulla spinalis be left
in its canal ; but it becomes immediately relaxed and open, if this part of the
nervous system be withdrawn. The action of this muscle depends upon the
medulla spinalis, and not upon the brain only.

However plain these observations may have made the fact, that there is a func-
tion of the neryous and muscular system distinct from sensation, from the yo-
luntary and respiratory motions, and from irritability, it is right, in every such
inquiry as the present, that the statements and reasonings should be made with
the experiment, as it were, actually before us. It has already been remarked, that
the voluntary and respiratory motions are spontaneous acts, not necessarily re-
