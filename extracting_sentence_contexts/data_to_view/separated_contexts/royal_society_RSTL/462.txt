T44 Mr. Curngvix's Observations and "Experiments

country: frequently contains in solution, and .which is -precipi-
tated from it by water. Before we-assert a fact, we should-be
well assured of the pureness of- our chemical agents. 'Dhis
supposed conversion of muriatic.or hyperoxygenized muriatic
acid into nitrous gas, will not pass-for a- decomposition, or 2
transmutation, .of that refractory radical; and the idea of the
change of potash into lime, is as erroneous as some other late
-assertions respecting the decomposition of the alkalis. The proportions of this salt are, as:I before stated,

Hyperoxygenized muriatic acid = = 38,3
Potash - - - o > 5 39,2
Water - - = ig 25

i 100,0.

2d Species. \Hyperozygenized Muriate of Soda. This salt is prepared:in the same manner, and: with the same
phenomena, as the former.
