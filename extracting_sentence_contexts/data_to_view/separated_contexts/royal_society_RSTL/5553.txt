96 MR. LUBBOCK'S ACCOUNT OF THE TWO METHODS OF REPRODUCTION

Mr. P. J. Browx* has obseryed parthenogenesis in Sphinz populi and in Arctia eaja,
and states that M. WAGNER has observed the same in S. ocellata. M. H. Lenocgf has met with a similar instance in Arctia caja; Dr. Kiee in Sphinz
populif, quoted by StezBoLD; Mr. Jounsrox in Smerinthus ocellatush ; Mr. Curmis in
Bombyz polyphemus ||; and in Bombys mori various naturalists have convinced themselves
of the same facts. Mr. WesrwooD has favoured me with the following extract from his unpublished
notes:—* Mr. Davis (the publisher of the Entomological Magazine, and himself a good
entomologist) informs me of a singular circumstance connected with the Egger moth,
which has been observed by Mr. Tay, the Irish entomologist, after whom MWesites Tardis
has been named, this gentleman having reared three generations of this moth from a
single impregnation.” The Rev. P. H. NeEwNnax of Guildford, the Rev. HuGn A. STowELL and Mr. E. W.
Ropix80Nn have kindly informed me by letter that they have observed the same fact
respectively in Smerinthus populi, Arctia villica, and Arctia caja.
