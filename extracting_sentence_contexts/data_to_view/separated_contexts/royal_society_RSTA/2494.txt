236 DR. C. CHREE: DISCUSSION OF KEW MAGNETIC DATA

observing conditions are more or less favourable. Still in most months the mean
times of the vibration and deflection experiments fell so nearly at fixed hours that
one might have applied the same correction to each observation, basing it on a mean
time from all the observations. As a matter of fact, however, this simplification was
not adopted when dealing with the 11 years 1890 to 1900, After 1900, as already
explained, magnetic conditions were less favourable at Kew. Still electric tram
disturbances are, on the whole, of a nature calculated to impair the accuracy of
individual observations rather than that of the arithmetic mean of a number of
observations. It thus appeared worth while investigating the annual inequality
deducible from absolute observations made in years subsequent to 1900.
