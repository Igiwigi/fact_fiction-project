operate precisely inthe same manner; but I have since had abun-
dant proof, that in essential circumstances there is but little
variety in the effects produced by poisons of any description,
when employed on animals of the same, or even of different
species, beyond what may be referred to the difference in the
quantity, or mode of application of the poison, or of the age
and power of the animal. This will explain the reason of my
not detailing, in the present. communication, 80 many of the
individual experiments from which my conclusions are drawn,
as in the former; at the same time I haye not been less care-

number of facts. Should these conclusions prove fewer, and
of less importance than might be expected, such defects will,
I trust, be regarded with indulgence; at least by those, who are
aware of the difficulty of conducting a series of physiological
experiments ; of the time, which they necessarily occupy; of ,
the numerous sources of fallacy and failure which exist; and
of the laborious attention to the minutest circumstances, which
is in consequence necessary in order to ayoid being led into
