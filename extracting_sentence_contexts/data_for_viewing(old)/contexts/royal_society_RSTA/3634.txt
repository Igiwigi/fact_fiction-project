experienced very slow rates of economic growth. What was it that capitalism did differently? The
major innovation was that surplus work from humans and fossil fuels was concentrated in the
hands of a class of people—‘capitalists’, the owners of the means of production—who did not just
store this surplus, or ceremoniously waste it for prestige, as elites and Royal courts did before,
but put it back into production [13]. Capitalists invested in machines, which made it possible
to appropriate more work from humans and nature, creating ever-more surplus. A substantial
portion of surplus was directed to science, research and development that led to the invention
of new machines, and the appropriation of more work from nature, further fuelling this cycle
of growth.

Empirical facts confirm this theory. There is a strong correlation between the input of useful
energy—that is energy left after subtracting the energy lost in its production and conversion—
and economic output [14]. Economists accounting for growth attribute it mostly to ‘total factor :
productivity’—a name given to all factors other than capital and labour that affect growth—a [=
shorthand for ‘technological progress’. But as Ayres & Warr [9] show total factor productivity is :3
strongly associated with the amount of energy used and the efficiency of conversion of energy :
inputs into useful work. Technological progress is therefore progress in using more energy, more DB
efficiently. :

If energy is a ‘cause’ of economic growth, as these studies suggest that it is, and if fossil fuels 14
are a unique source of high EROI, then decoupling growth from fossil fuels is less likely than ae
conventionally believed. If the economic process is the application of energy and human work &
on the transformation of materials, then economic growth is also likely to be strongly coupled 18
