It has
frequently been reported in the case of the mouse that these hormones retard or inhibit
spermatogenesis (see review by Moore 1939), a result which appears to be comparable
with the inhibition of ovarian mitosis by injections of oestrogenic hormones. Much,
however, appears to depend on the dose given, for Selye & Friedman (1941) have shown
that although small amounts of androgenic substances inhibit testis growth, large amounts
do not. This they consider due to the fact that, while in both cases there is an inhibition
of pituitary function and so of natural androgen secretion, only with heavy dosage is
sufficient androgen introduced to maintain spermatogenesis. Further, Shay, Gershon-
Cohen, Paschkis & Fels (1941) report that large doses of androgens stimulate spermato-
genesis in immature rats, while Cutuly & Cutuly (1940), using testosterone propionate,
have induced and maintained spermatogenesis in hypophysectomized rats. The experi-
ments with mice and rats have usually been complicated by the existence in a functioning
state of the natural mechanism for testis stimulation, but in annually breeding mammals

experiment is easier.
