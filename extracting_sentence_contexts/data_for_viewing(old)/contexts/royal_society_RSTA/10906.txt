detect much, or any, difference between the appearance of the uniform B of Sn 16
at 700° and the uniform y of Sn 18 at the same temperature, provided both alloys
have been very slowly cooled.

In all the alloys of this group, when the temperature falls below C’XD’, the phase §
crystallises out in ribands at the borders of the erystal grains of the solid solution, as
well as in the form of fern-leaf or rosette scattered through the grains. This
crystallisation is well seen in the photographs of Sn 17, 18, and 19, that accompany
the paper (see Plates 4 and 5). The 8, as seen in the photographs, is white ; it contains
a larger proportion of tin than the mother-solid round it, and the 8 increases in amount
as the percentage of tin in the whole alloy increases. The 6 first appears in the
ribands which border the grains, these ribands being produced at higher temperatures
than the fern-leaf. We are disposed to think that this peculiarity is due to the fact


THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COPPER-TIN SERIES OF ALLOYS. 13

that, in spite of the approximate uniformity of the alloy above the line C’XD’, there
must be round each 8 grain an envelope, somewhat richer in tin than the grain itself,
produced by the collection between the grains of the last traces of mother-liquid.
These intergranular spaces would, therefore, as the temperature fell, be the first parts
to become saturated with tin, and the tin-rich 5, in consequence, began to crystallise
in these spaces. The substance between the crystals of 5 is uniform until the
temperature X is reached, when the residual solid solution breaks up into the
C’ eutectic complex of « and 6. A careful examination of this complex with a high
