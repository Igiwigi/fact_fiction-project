They found that as the structure of sidered, the same as when they are outside a flock, indicating

ging niches decreased, mainly for insectivores, so their within a flock. For example, Arremon flavirostris, which is con-
mixed species-flocks were at high altitudes of understory sidered a species preferentially from low strata [29] continued

and ground-foraging species. In our study, the variation in to use these strata while participating in a mixed flock,

the structure of the vegetation was more related to the fact and this had also been reported by Capllonch [83] for Tucu-

that the flocks of the north/centre of the Yungas were more man. Similar is what happens with Campephilus leucopogon or
associated with the structure of the more highly developed Picumnus cirratus, which continued to use the bark of trees,
canopy, and the flocks of the south to the understory and along with the rest of the woodpeckers, dendrocolaptids
mid-story strata. However, in general, our flocks were and some furnariids [29,83].
