A Berlin was the centre of the first German Association, as Gottingen was of the second.
In 1829 and 1830 the Berlin Asociation had correspondents in very distant parts of the
European continent, such, for example, as St. Petersburg, Kasan, and Nicolaieff, by
whom the direction of the declination magnet was observed with great care and pre-
cision at hourly intervals of absolute time for forty-four successive hours at eight con-
certed periods of the year; and to the continuance of these term-observations, as they
were called, there were added in March 1834 similar observations at Gottingen, but
made with greater frequency, viz. at intervals of ten minutes. The intercomparison of
the hourly observations revealed the general fact that very considerable fluctuations, $till
happening however on days that were apparently casual and irregular, were synchronous
at all the stations of observation ; whilst the ten-minutely observations at Gottingen,
which had no parallels elsewhere, showed numerous intermediate fluctuations of sI1milar
