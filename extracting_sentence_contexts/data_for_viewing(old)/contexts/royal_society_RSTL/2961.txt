be seen from Table IX. that the rate of pulsation is gradually diminished from the
earliest period of the larya state until the insect has changed into a pupa,â€”that while
the rate of pulsation within a few hours after the insect has left the egg varies from
seventy-five to ninety, and in its second skin, or at an average age of about two hun-
dred and forty hours, it is but very little lower, it becomes in its third reduced to an
average of seyenty-five, in its fourth to less than sixty, in the middle period of its
fifth to a maximum of fifty-five, and the latter period of the same to scarcely more
than thirty-two pulsations per minute. These are interesting facts as connected with
the power which the inseet possesses of generating heat. It is, as before stated, at
about the middle period of its fifth state or condition as a larva, when it is feeding
most voraciously, that the insect is able to generate the greatest amount of heat.

Although it will be seen from the additional facts about to be stated that both during
Sleeping and activity, when most vigorous as a larya, as also when passing into the
enfeebled condition of a pupa, there is a coincident and correspondent activity or
diminution in the rate of pulsation with the increase of motion, respiration, or diges-
tion; yet the primary source of the development of heat is not dependent upon the
velocity or rapidity of the circulation, since the period in which there is the greatest
rapidity of circulation is that in which the larya is least able to generate and maintain
its greatest amount of temperature. Another circumstance which tends greatly to
prove that the amount of heat does not necessarily depend upon the rapidity of the
circulation is the different rates of pulsation whenthe insect is placed in different tem-
peratures, or when in different states of health in the same temperature. In the first
case the rate of pulsation may be very considerably increased, while the amount of tem-
perature remains nearly, or perhaps exactly the same. In the latter instance the tempe-
