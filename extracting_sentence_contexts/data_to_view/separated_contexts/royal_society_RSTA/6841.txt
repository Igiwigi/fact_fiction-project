The data do not warrant a more precise value than k = 0-002.

11. THE TRANSMISSION OF THE SURGE THROUGH THE STRAITS OF DOVER

The possession of data for Dover, Newhaven and Dieppe has made it possible to trace
the transmission of a North Sea storm surge through the Straits of Dover for the first time
with any reliability, though it must be borne in mind throughout the following discussion
that no corrections have been possible to the residuals at Newhaven and Dieppe for wind
effects in the English Channel. It is not considered that this fact seriously invalidates the
conclusions drawn for an area which is relatively small and sheltered in respect to the
prevailing north to north-westerly winds. Co-disturbance charts have been drawn at six-hourly intervals for the period 12.00h
31 January to 00.00h 2 February covering both the northern and southern approaches to
the Straits, and are reproduced in figure 6. Harmony has been maintained between these
charts and those for the North Sea, and the fact that the charts are based on only two ports
in the English Channel has been partly compensated for by the assumption that the lines
of equal level will be densest at the narrowest cross-section.
