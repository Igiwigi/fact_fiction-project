However, in dry seasons, the herbage has

Beemed rather to die at the bottom than to ripen. Z As referred to elsewhere, the excessively dark green colour is indicative of a high
ercentage of nitrogen, an abundant formation of chlorophyll, but, deficient carbon-
similation, due to a deficiency of certain mineral constituents, relatively to the

Amount of nitrogen taken up. In fact, there is, s0 far as the nitrogen available, and

She chlorophyll formed, are concerned, 80 to speak potential, but not actual growth. S It is obvious, therefore, that the superphosphate used did nob suffice for the full

Sm of the nitrogen supplied.
