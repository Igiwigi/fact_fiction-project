It grasps round the odontoid process, and is perforated by the remnant of
the chorda. This ligamentum transversum is serially homologous with the “ inter-
vertebral pad” between the odontoid and the centrum of the epistropheus, It is
also homologous with the intervertebral pads which exist between any successive
vertebrae, in the shape of the so-called menisci or annuli fibrosi. These have been
well described by Jancer (Lit., No. 67), who in his carefully-written paper had
already drawn attention to the important fact that the atlas-ring does not articulate
with the Centrum II., but with a separate element interposed between the first two
centra. He had also shown the ligamentum transversum and the menisci to be
serially homologous structures. The centre of each meniscus is, of course, perforated
by the chorda dorsalis, the last trace of which remains as the ligamentum suspen-
sorium corporum vertebralium ; the first or foremost of these is the better known
ligamentum suspensorium dentis epistrophei.
