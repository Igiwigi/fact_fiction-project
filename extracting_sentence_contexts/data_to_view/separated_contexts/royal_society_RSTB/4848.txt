Perhaps
half to three-quarters of an hour is a fair average, but it may be longer. So far as the experiments with hens are concerned, they thus throw no light on any
possible direct effect of turning upon hatching. They do not even afford evidence that
such a direct effect exists, for the turning of the eggs is the result of their travelling
about, and for the travelling there is ample reason in the fact that the temperature under
a hen is not uniform, and unless the eggs are moved about some will have been incubated
at higher temperatures than others. Motion of Eggs in Incubators.—-While collecting information as to the change of weight
of eggs during incubation it was noticed that the weighed eggs frequently hatched
better than the rest. The weighings were made every two days, and, as every egg in
each incubator was turned twice and cooled once each day, the weighed eggs received
