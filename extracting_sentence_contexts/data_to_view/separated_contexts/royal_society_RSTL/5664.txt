Proceeding from the front of this nucleus are two or three considerable
bundles of fibres and several smaller ones, which run forwards and take nearly the same
course as the hypoglossal nerves towards the olivary body : near their origin the network
in the antero-lateral column, through which they pass, is crowded with cells, of all shapes
and sizes, which send out their processes in every direction between the longitudinal fasci-
culi, and probably establish a most intimate union of the parts amongst which they lie.
me of the fibres of these bundles, as well as separate fibres isswing from the white
Solumn, may be traced into this nucleus; but others turn inwards, and after running
ong the border of the white column and lower part of the nucleus, they decussate
Shrough the raphe with their opposite fellows. Along each side of the raphe runs a
Sonsiderable blood-vessel, which sends out lateral branches to follow the bundles of the
Plexus and anastomose with the vessels that accompany the antero-posterior bundles just
ribed.

 (57.) The glossopharyngeal nerve passes inwards and backwards, in two or three
Sundles, through the gelatinous substance and across the arciform fibres. On reaching
He group of longitudinal fasciculi, which lie at the extremity of the vagal nucleus and
-3ow adjoin the network of the posterior pyramid, its outer portion separates, in a
rush-like manner, into many smaller bundles, which subdivide the fasciculi into a cor-
Besponding number of parts, and interlace between and around them : many of its fibres
Ft this point appear to become longitudinal ; some turn into the auditory ganglion, along
Fhe lateral border of which they may be traced in part through the network of the
Foxterior pyramid (6); the middle fibres of the nerve proceed to the remaining cells
Sf the vagal nucleus, and many of them appear to extend as far as the group of cells
Yhat form the commencement of the fasciculus teres and the continuation of the hypo-
Slossal nucleus: as in the case of the vagus, the anterior portion of the nerve, forming a
Slistinet bundle, turns inwards round the summit of the antero-lateral column, and pass-
Ang through the most anterior and largest cells, sends forward a series of returning
loops, first through the antero-posterior bundles along the inner border of the caput
cornts posterioris, and then in succession through the network of the lateral column, as
it makes its way towards the raphe (see fig. 36, Plate XVIL.); but in this course its
fibres lie side by side with those which have been already described as proceeding from
the antero-lateral column in the same direction to decussate through the raphe with their
opposite fellows, 80 that it becomes almost impossible to identify them and ascertain if
they share in the decussation ; that, they do 80, however, is rendered extremely probable
by the fact that in Birds all the fibres of the eighth pair of nerves, of which the highest
correspond to the glos80pharyngeal, may be distinctly seen to decussate through the
