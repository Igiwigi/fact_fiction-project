Observations are incomplete and noisy and are obtained through
Yr = yx + €P, (2.8)

where x; is the true state in the reduced space, y, ¢ RN» and Hy ¢ RNv*N* are the observation
vector and operator respectively at t, while €? is the observation error, assumed to be
uncorrelated in time and normally distributed with mean 0 and a variance-covariance matrix
(6°) In,, where In, is the identity matrix of size Ny x Ny and o° is the standard deviation. For
simplicity, the observation error standard deviation is taken to be constant and the observation
operator linear. Both assumptions can be relaxed without major drawbacks even if it can induce
practical difficulties. The ideal, most favourable, situation in which the full system’s state is
observed in the reduced space with no error is referred to as the ‘perfect observation’ case: yx = xx.
For convenience, we further assume that observations are available regularly at multiples of the
model time step such that At = ty, — tk = N;ét, Nc € N*. This also accounts for the fact that, in
general, the observation sampling period is longer than the integration time step of the numerical
model.

3. Method

(a) Loss function approximation

Let us assume that an estimation of x, (k € {0,...,K}) is available at observation times, every At =
N,ét, so that

Xpp1 = IT o MN (24, 58), (3.1)
