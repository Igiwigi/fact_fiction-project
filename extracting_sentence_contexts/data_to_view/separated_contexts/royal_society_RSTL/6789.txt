only, five lines cutting II. only, and ten lines cutting neither I. nor IL [The theory of the 27 lines depends on the expression of the equation of the surface
in the form P=Q=0, where P and Q are real or imaginary cubics breaking up into
linear factors; in fact, if the equation be 80 expressed, it is at once seen that each of the
planes P=0 meets each of the planes Q=0 in a line on the surface, 80 that the form
gives at once 9 out of the 27 lines. The three planes represented by the equation P=0
(or Q=0) are termed a Trihedral of the surface.]
