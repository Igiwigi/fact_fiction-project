In fact, one might profitably consider that the urcaryote [the earli- prokaryotes. The former were first called ESPs by Hartman &
est eukaryote] in ways resembles the progenote more than do Fedorov [2,29], who claimed that there are 300-400 of them,
prokaryotes. I would like to suggest that the eukaryotic cell those with identifiable functions being (in the main) ‘com-

evolved from the progenote at a somewhat later time than did
its prokaryotic counterparts, and that this is in fact responsible
for the origin of the nucleus [8, p. 14].

later introduced the term CSS for eukaryote-specific structures
(nucleus, nucleoli, Golgi apparatus and so forth) in which
many ESPs play a role.

Three year earlier, one of us (W.F.D.) and James Darnell inde-
pendently advanced this same idea [23,24]. Stunned (as were
