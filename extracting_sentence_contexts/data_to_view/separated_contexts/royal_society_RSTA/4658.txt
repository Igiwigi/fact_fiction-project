In spherical mechanisms the relative lengths of the links may be represented by
the magnitude of the angles at the centre of the sphere which they subtend. This
suggests that a spherical movement may be represented and distinguished from -a
plane movement by inserting the value of the angles between the letters O and U,
which represent the motions.* Thus for examples :——

The spherical counterpart of OoOo is BOaoBOaof, expressing the fact that
opposite links are equal to one another. Of 0070U, the spherical counterpart is BO«O?a0BUB where B > a.

Of oO%ol it is $vOaO*aohwUha. a < 47; and so on for all the other plane
mechanisms previously enumerated, with one exception.
