of the cervical portion of the spinal cord, but they are extremely few, and ¢
scattered (see fig. 14). By the time the dorsal region of the cord is reached there i
scarcely a degenerated fibre to be seen, if one, occupying this antero-lateral region
of the cord, in which region Marcur figures so extensive a tract of degenerated
fibres as passing down even to the lumbar region of the spinal cord, where not
single degenerated fibre was found by me after ablation of one lateral lobe of the
cerebellum.

V. Extrepation oF THE Mippie Lose or THE CEREBELLUM,

In removing the middle lobe of the cerebellum, in order to study the degenerations
which follow such a lesion, I was always careful to avoid removing any of the latera
lobe on one or both sides. In fact, I preferred to leave a little of the middle lobe,
bordering on the lateral, rather than injure the lateral lobe in my operation. In orde
to be still more certain that the degenerations I found were consequent on destructio!
of the middle lobe, and not due to any injury of the lateral lobes, I removed sm
portions of the middle lobe, in some cases, in which procedure there could be né
possibility of the lateral lobes being injured. I therefore feel confident that th
degenerations I am about to describe are due to destruction of the middle lobe, ane
not to any implication of the lateral lobes in the lesion.

As after ablation of one lateral lobe of the cerebellum, so here degenerated nerv
fibres were found in the superior, middle, and inferior peduncles of the organ ; .
whereas, with the exception of the superior peduncle, degenerated fibres were ©
found in those of one side in the former case, they were found in all the peduncles ¢
