At the
back of the wall is a grape-vine, and when in leaf, it 80 shades the wall that its tem-
perature is not much affected by the sun's rays ; but, before the vine is in leaf, it may
raise the temperature a trifle ; yet from some casual obseryations scattered over my
Journal as tests, I do not find that the said thermometer is sensibly influenced by the
heat of the sun at 8 a.w., the time of reading the instrument. On the 13th of May,
1847, I moved the thermometer a few feet from its former position on the wall, with
the same aspect, but, at the back of this part of the wall, there is a sort of grotto
or summer-house, which is coyered by thatch and completely interrupts the sun's rays
from the wall ; hence its present situation may perhaps be considered more eligible
for a mean temperature than its former position, but I do not find any difference
worth notice.” The general fact, however, of a higher winter temperature, and of a lower summer
temperature at the Apartments of the Royal Society, is satisfactorily proved by both
sets of comparisons, and it is evident that the same cause has been in operation at
both times, and to the same amount. There can be no doubt that this cause is the
vicinity of the river Thames to the locality of the observations. 576 MR. GLAISHER ON THE THERMOMETRICAL OBSERVATIONS
