These changes and many more take place independently in a strictly parallel manner
in many distinct phyla of Labyrinthodonts. In the few cases where we know approxi-
mately true phyletic lines, short though they be, it is clear that the changes progress
regularly. An analysis of the whole fauna known from any one horizon shows that,
although different phyla differ in the degree of advance of any character, they do not
do so over a large range; and it is, in consequence, possible to make out the whole
story by a consideration of all forms, whatever their exact mutual relationships.

The majority of the Lower Permian Labyrinthodonts were terrestrial animals; all
those from the Upper Trias were aquatic—the majority of them, in all probability,
incapable of progression on land. Consideration of the whole of the evidence, especially
that which may be derived from the shoulder girdle, renders it certain that the Triassic
amphibia were the descendants of terrestrial forms—that, in fact, we have in them an
exact parallel to the living Perennibranchiate Urodela, now known to be only secondarily
aquatic.

For the last seventy years it has been known that animals identical in the structure
of the dermal roof of the skull and in their dentition with the Labyrinthodonts occurred
in the Coal measures, and even in the Lower Carboniferous coal-bearing rocks of Scotland.

Despite the remarkable work of the amateur anatomists Tuomas ArrHEy and ALBANY
Hancock carried out fifty years ago, these animals have remained practically unknown
and their structure has been completely misunderstood. Largely from the material
in the Newcastle Museum collected by Tuomas Arrury, I am now able to describe in
