ZI have only determined the maximum values of the bending-moments due to the lon-
dinal pressure in the preceding examples, because they are the only values having
ch practical interest, and because my chief aim has been to show that it is not proper
t& omit all consideration of the bending effect, of this pressure in all cases, as is usually
<ne. In long fine ships, such as the © Minotaur,” the error introduced by omitting it
Buld be comparatively small for still-water trains; but in ships of more moderate
xZoportions this is not the case. Were it at all desirable we might obviously determine
He amount, and the moment, about the neutral axis, of the pressure on any transverse
tion, in a manner sinilar to that employed above for the midship section, and might
x&present the results graphically by curves of moments constructed similarly to those for
the moments of vertical forces. In fact, by using the same scales of foot-tons, we might
cZmbine the curves of moments for longitudinal pressure and for vertical forces, and
«Htain a single curve which should represent their joint effect. This need not be done,
mwever; for, as I have before remarked, the still-water strains experienced by a ship
ae not those which regulate the provision of strength ; and we shall see hereafter that
iSis only for still water that the longitudinal has such an effect in proportion to the
vgrtical forces as to require quantitative consideration.
VThe preceding considerations respecting the still-water strains resulting from the action
: yertical and horizontal forces on a ship have been given at considerable length, be-
use they furnish many extensions and corrections of existing knowledge, and also be-
Ause methods similar to those here employed will hereafter be applied to the severer
strains experienced by ships when at sea or when ashore. Besides this they have a
special interest and importance themselves. They do not, it is true, exercise very much
