This, together with the definition of P, (5.43), forms the criterion for stability. The
expression (7.11) may be expected to hold for positive values of » from 0 to 1, but it
holds over a greater range than this. It holds in fact till the second term ceases to be a
small correction. In calculating numerical values for P it was found that this occurred,
in the cases considered, at about the value » = — 0-5. Evaluation of the Root of As = 0 when yu is Negative.
