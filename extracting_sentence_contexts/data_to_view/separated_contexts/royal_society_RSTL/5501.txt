pound which at that time did not coincide with this view was Lov16's 80-called ethosti-
bylic acid, the formula of which, Sb C,H,O,, I snggested would probably be found to be
erroneous #; and in fact, L6v1G has since announced this to be the case: he now assigns
to this compound the formula Sb(C,H,),O,, 2SbO,, which harmonizes perfectly with the
general view I ventured to propound. The recent researches of MgrcKF upon the com-
pounds of stibethyl, although they probably prove the existence of certain new com-
pounds of this radical, are by no means conclusive as to the non-existence of the bodies
originally described by L6vi6. With regard to those stanethyl compounds which have
been since discovyered, several of them correspond exactly with the known oxides of tin ;
the remainder are also by no means irreconcileable with my hypothesis, if we consider
the polymeric attributes of stannic acid.
