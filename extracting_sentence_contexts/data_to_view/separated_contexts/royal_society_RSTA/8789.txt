Diffuse series, \p—md.—Kayser and Runce traced the first three members of this
series, as shown in Table I. The first in their list was composed of three lines,
4.13569-95, 3548-16 and 3531-95 (Rowland scale), and it was remarked that the triplet
was possibly more complex. There are in fact six other lines close to these three which
must certainly be considered to form part of the diffuse triplet. The wave-lengths
given for these lines by different observers differ considerably, as will be seen from
Table II. A difficulty is caused by the fact that the lines are grouped together in sets
of three, and in each set the lines are very close together ; also the lines are very diffuse .
and with a strong tendency to reversal, so that their resolution is difficult.
