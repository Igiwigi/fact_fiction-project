It is as though the cortex of the frontal lobe had flowed down
over the lateral surface and become banked up along the orbital margin. The lower
end of the precentral region in Pithecanthropus is somewhat fuller and therefore it is
apparent that the changes leading to the expansion of the frontal lobe were in a slightly
more advanced stage in Pithecanthropus than in Sinanthropus. We have already
referred to the fact that the region behind the parietal eminence is also slightly fuller
in Pithecanthropus. The frontal expansions are probably the expression of the higher
motor responses to the development of the sensory areas in the parietal and post-
temporal regions. We should therefore find corresponding differences in the temporal
region.
