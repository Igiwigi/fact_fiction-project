anterior wall has much the same yale both in Arius and Platystome, aud in cach
nike is wholly or partially n portion of the tunica externa; and further, that the
transyerse membrane as a separable and distinct structure is entirely wanting in
Platystoma—w fact which may possibly be associated with the extensive insertion of
the great compressor museles’ into the walls of the bladder. We lave elsewhere, in
our description of Mecrores, given reasons for beheving that even the tmneverse
membraue is mevely a special portion of the superficial coat of the air-bladder, whieh,
for physiological purposes, has acquired certain fixed skeletal attachments, and with a
similar olject itis readily conceiyable that, in addition, even w stratum of fibres
belonging to the tunica externa of the anterior wall my <lso acquire a similar von-
nection with rigid portions of the axial skeleton, such, in fact, as we have shown to
be the case in Arius and in Platystoma, and other normal Pimelodine,

On the whole the Weberian ossicles in Arius pidaide ave very similar to those of
Platystoma, The anterior process of the tripis (fig. 49, ta.) is somewhat. shorter
and of greater width than in most other Silnroids. The eresceutic process (.c.) is
rather thicker than usual, apparently in accordance with the greater thickness of the
stratum of fibres attached to it, but on the ventral surface of its root the thickening
abruptly ceases, leaving at thab point a alight ridge, which, like the ventral ridge in
Maerones, veeesives the insertion of «. slip of fibres derived from the median portion of
the anterior wall of the bladder, The crescentie process has no heel-like projection
as in Macrones, nov is its posterior margin deeply grooved as in Platystomé, Claustra
are present in the form of elongated spicular ossicles, slizhtly curved at their interior
