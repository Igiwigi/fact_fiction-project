sociation between attention and consciousness. It was only in the refutation of
evidence against RPT (e.g. neural correlates of recurrent processing were
observed during inattentional blindness) that such a link was formed between
the theory itself and the double dissociation view [2]. This apparent counterevi-
dence, however, does not necessitate such a link, as it can be accommodated in
the updated formulation of RPT [3]. For example, some types of recurrent proces-
sing may occur during inattention, while the key types that are necessary for
conscious perception may not. Therefore, RPT does not in fact mandate a
mutual independence of (all types of) attention and consciousness.

Second, attention does not necessarily lead to cognitive access. We outlined
this point on page 3 of our original paper [1], and M&H have written extensively
in agreement [4]. The currently accepted broad definition of attention is a set of
mechanisms that bias (select) a subset of information for further processing. It should
be emphasized that further processing is not synonymous with cognitive access.
For example, attentional modulations have been repeatedly observed to occur
at 70-100 ms after stimulus onset in early visual areas V4 and MT in both
humans [5-7] and non-human primates [8-11]. These attention effects indicate
that low-level selection processes lead to further processing in these cortical
areas, but it is not clear that such early visual processing is necessarily involved
