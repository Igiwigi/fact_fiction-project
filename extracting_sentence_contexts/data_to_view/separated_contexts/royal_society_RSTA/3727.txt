Of these results, Mr. Frion and I have already published with a less general proof
(xxiii), (xxiv.), (xxvi.), (xxvii), (xlii.), and (xliii.). Instead of (xxv.) and (xxviii),
we found

Probable error of py = °67449 \/720%/,/n, and R,,,, = 1,

i.e., replacing \/96 = 9°8 by ,/72 = 8°5, and ‘866 by 1. This was due to the fact
that we considered the variations from normality to be given by a distribution of
Type III. (see p. 276). The differences, however, are not such as to invalidate argu-
ments based on the general order of the probable error of p4.
