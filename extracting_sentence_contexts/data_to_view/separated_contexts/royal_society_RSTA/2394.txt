There are, therefore,
two stages, a first in which the Leslie pressure is adjusted to the load by fluid flowing
in or out from between the faces, and a second in which the reaction to the load is adjusted
by the elastic forces between the atoms and molecules. In the first stage comparable mechanical states are states of equal Leslie pressure. The proof lies in the fact that comparisons so limited yield surprisingly simple
relations between the variables. * Actual measurements will be found on page 224 of XI. The following were obtained two years

later :â€”

Load + area.
