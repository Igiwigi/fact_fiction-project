Hg, CO, C.P., has 41 lines - CO, C.P., has 10

Hg, CO, R., has 18 lines CO, R., has 8

Of these last Nos. 2, 46, 59, and 78 are found in N only (that is with Hg electrodes,
for with other metals they occur in all the gases). Nos. 13 and 32 belong to CO, the
rest are common to the three gases. Tt deserves notice that many of the lines of Hg Hg
are wanting in the gases, the lowest number being 13 in CO, C.P., the highest (29) in
: CO,R. This may partly arise from mercury and its vapour having different sets of lines,
the latter of which are displaced by those of the gas, fewer in number Were this the
8ole cause, the same lines would be missing in each gas spectrum ; and the differ-
ence of the numbers shows that the presence of a gas actually prevents the deyelop-
anent of 80me mercurial lines. Corresponding facts occur in other spectra, those of H
especially,

The effect of a metal is most perceptible near the negative boundary of a spectrum,
where some lines are brilliant for a short distance and then continue with much less
brightness. The contrast is 0 great that, without measurement, one could scarcely
believe the line to be the sxame. That its existence in the faint state is due to that
meta] which causes its partial splendour, is disproved by its occurring with other metals.
In illustration I refer to the spectrum of bismuth (N) at the negative edge as compared
to that of the centre (Table XIL.), where it is seen that though lines (especially in the
green) which are scarcely visible in the latter are intensely bright in the former, and
faint single lines are seen as two, yet no decidedly new one appears. This is most
