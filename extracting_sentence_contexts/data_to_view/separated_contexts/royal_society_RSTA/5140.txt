In the context of geoengineering, the moral hazard is not so much an economic risk but
a social, ethical and political one. Geoengineering might be perceived as an insurance policy
against climate change, undermining support for existing climate policies. In fact, there are
multiple levels on which a geoengineering moral hazard might operate. First, the prospect of
geoengineering could cause individuals to curb voluntary efforts to reduce carbon emissions. The
concept of behavioural ‘rebound’ is well understood (the idea that adopting an energy-saving
technology can sometimes increase energy use, undermining the overall impact of the technology
itself [18]).
