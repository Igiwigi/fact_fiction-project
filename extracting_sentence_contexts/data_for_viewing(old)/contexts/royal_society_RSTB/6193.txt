or are inverted, while within 100 yards Lower Comley Sandstone dips normally towards
the south-east at 65°.

As to the existence of unconformities within the Cambrian rocks, the evidence in
this area is not clear. The fact that all the Lower Cambrian limestone horizons,
including the Lapworthella Limestone at the top, are present, as at Comley, together
with the fact that the Lapworthella Limestone is succeeded as at Comley by the
Paradoxides groomi Beds suggests that any unconformity between Lower and Middle
Cambrian must be slight or at any rate only developed in certain areas, but the
change in character of the deposits and of the faunas indicates a long time
interval.
