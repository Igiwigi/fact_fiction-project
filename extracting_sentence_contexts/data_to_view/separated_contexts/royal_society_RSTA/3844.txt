As illustrated in figure 11a, simulations in the lower dynamic range can increase the temporal
variation in the identification of the elastic stiffness parameter. This becomes more obvious when
the mean stiffness values with corresponding standard deviations are evaluated (table 4). This
appears to be due to the fact that a capacity of 255 grey levels is just not sufficient to provide
a stable identification of the material parameters as illustrated by the difference between the
