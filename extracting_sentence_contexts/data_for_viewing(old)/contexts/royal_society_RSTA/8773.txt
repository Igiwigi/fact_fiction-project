effect to a much greater extent, and even relatively to 4471.

Our conclusion must be that reduction of pressure in the tube can enhance the line
\4472 to a great degree, but at the same time leaves other members of the series with
nearly the same relative intensities. In the case of the Sharp series, the discussion is
made rather more difficult by virtue of the disappearance of \7065 and \4121 from our
plate at low pressure. But we can calculate the limiting intensities they can have. If
their “true” intensity was unity in this case, while 14713 had its true intensity 6°44,
they would be visible. On a scale of intensity 10 for 14713, they become visible if
their intensity exceeds the value 10/6'44 or 1°55. We may accordingly assume that
it is less.

Comparing this investigation with the fact of the existence of an intensity 2°4 on
this scale, for the line \4121 in the “ordinary” spectrum, as in the table, it is evident
that the phenomenon found in the Diffuse series is present here also, and to the same
degree. In the case of nebulz, the Sharp series of Helium is always very weak, but

the line \4713 is well-known. Its behaviour under low pressure is, in the light of
these experiments, strictly comparable with that of 4471, and these lines are
respectively the second members of the two series.

We may now take up the consideration of the effects produced by admixture of
