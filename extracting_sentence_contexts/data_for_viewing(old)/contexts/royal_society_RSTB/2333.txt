* Loscumip? expressed & in units, so that his values represent the number of cubic

metres of the gas at 0° C. and 760 millims, pressure which would pass per hour across a section of
1 square metre of area when the gradient of density varies by 1 atmosphere in a length of 1 metre. To
convert LoscuMipt’s values into ordinary C.G.S. units they must be multiplied by 2°77.

is nearly constant if the gases have no chemical action on each other. This law is in
harmony with the kinetic theory, from which in fact it is deducible.

k was also found by Loscumrpr to vary inversely as the pressure p of the inter-
diffusing gases, and directly as the square of the absolute temperature, so that

temperatures on the absolute scale.*

For the combination carbon dioxide + air, which is the important one for our
purpose, Loscumipr found k° = +1423,
