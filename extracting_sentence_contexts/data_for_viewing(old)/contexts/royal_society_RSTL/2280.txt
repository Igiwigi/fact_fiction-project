more or less affect the sensibility.

Certain circumstances essential to the study of the pathology of the brain are ex-
plained through this part of anatomy ; first, that motion and sensation should, in by
far the greater number of cases, be lost together, in disease of the brain ; because the
sensorial extremities of hoth columns are in the hemisphere of the cerebrum; secondly,
it is seen why it is that the sensibility, as well as the power of motion, is injured on
the opposite side of the body when the hemisphere of the cerebrum is hurt or dis-
eased, for both columns decussate ; in the third place, the anatomy of the origin or
root of the fifth nerye explains very satisfactorily why, in palsy, the privation of sen-
8ibility of the side of the face corresponds with that of the body.

My paper should perhaps have terminated here, with these demonstrable facts, but
I am tempted to reach a little further.

Further examination of the relation between the Brain and Spinal Marrow.

Other questions will be suggested in reference to the sxymptoms of disease in the
brain. When the side of the body is paralytic, how far are the nerves affected which
appear to have their origin above the decussations ? Does the ninth or lingual, or the
portio dura of the seventh nerve, correspond with the spinal nerves ? Do the third
nerve and the muscles of the eye partake of the condition of the body ?

As there is no decussation above the apparent origin of these nerves, and as the
commissures of the brain do not serve to explain this phenomenon, we are directed
