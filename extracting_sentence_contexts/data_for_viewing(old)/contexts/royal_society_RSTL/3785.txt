we cannot but be struck with the great uniformity in type in the earliest stages of
formation; however widely different the structures ultimately formed.

78. On'a late occasion4F, I showed the foundation of the new being, in what are
called the highest animals, to have the same structure as that of the simplest plant.
We now find this uniformity in type to be recognizable at later periods. For, not
only does every tissue seem to arise out of discs having all the same appearance, but
the primary arrangement and early metamorphoses of these discs seem to be the
same. We recognize the same combination of spiral threads in the mould of cheese,
as in the brain of Man. How wonderful the fact, that out of materials s0 similar,
structures should be formed endowed with properties s0 different !

79. I have had an opportunity of examining the spermatozoon from the epididymis
of a person who died suddenlyF. The large extremity appears to me to be a disc, the
pellucid depression in which, corresponding apparently to the © sugient orifice” of
some authors, is probably analogous to the source of new substance in other discs.
Each of the two sides of the peripheral portion of the disc is extended into a thread :
these two threads forming, by being twisted, the part usually designated as the tail ;
an appendage the office of which appears to be to © scull” along to its destination the
essential part or disc, and more particularly its pellucid centre. The formation of the
* tail,” as now described, out of two twisted threads, seems to explain the observation
of R. Wacnes, who, in rare instances, met with the caudal part double (as I sup-
