defined on a low-rank approximation (usually q = 2), enabling a graphical representation of the
markers. When q = p the biplot has the following properties:

— The cosine of the angle between any two vectors representing variables is the coefficient
of correlation between those variables; this is a direct result of the fact that the matrix
of inner products between those markers is HH’ = AL?A’ = (n — 1)S (2.4), so that inner
products between vectors are proportional to covariances (variances for a common
vector).

— Similarly, the cosine of the angle between any vector representing a variable and the axis
representing a given PC is the coefficient of correlation between those two variables.

— The inner product between the markers for individual i and variable j gives the (centred)
value of individual i on variable j. This is a direct result of the fact that GH’ = X*. The
practical implication of this result is that orthogonally projecting the point representing
individual i onto the vector representing variable j recovers the (centred) value xj; — X;-
