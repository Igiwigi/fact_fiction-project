I am inclined to refer the effect to carbonic oxide
present in the gas, but haye not had time to yerify the suspicion, The power of the
plates was not destroyed (640. 646.). 655, Such are the general facts of these remarkable interferences. Whether the
effect produced by such small quantities of certain gases depends upon any direct
action which they may exert upon the particles of oxygen and hydrogen, by which
the latter are rendered less inclined to combine, or whether it depends upon their
modifying the action of the plate temporarily (for they produce no real change on it),
by investing it through the agency of a stronger attraction than that of the hydrogen,
or otherwise, remains to be decided by more extended experiments,

656. The theory of action which I have giyen for the original phenomena appears
to me quite sufficient to account for all the effects by reference to known properties,
and dispenses with the assumption of any new power of matter.
