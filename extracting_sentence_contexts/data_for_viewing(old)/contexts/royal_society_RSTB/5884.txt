422 ARIENS KAPPERS ON SOME CORRELATIONS BETWEEN SKULL AND BRAIN.

and myself* and in the second brain of Plate 38 (P.P. = prelunate). This often coincides with a flattening
of the lunate crescent.

Tf a continuous midfrontal, connecting with the inferior precentral is less frequent
with Europeans we should realize the fact that such an exquisite dolichocephaly as with
Negro races is rare in Europe. Still we may consider it as a more primitive arrangement,
as the continuous midfrontal, including its connection with the precentral, seems to have
predominated in the Neanderthal race as it does in Pithecanthropus, and apes.

The survival of this more primitive arrangement in some races may, however, be due
to the fact that just as in primitive man the skull form is a rather long one, which
seems to favour this condition as it favours the simpler course of the Sylvian and
temporal sulci.

In meso- and brachy-hypsicephalic both conditions are less frequent, although the simpler midfrontal
also occurs with such races.+

But on the other hand the tendency of the midfrontal sulcus to split up into pieces,
and to lose its connection with the precentral in general, may have to do with the
evolution of the frontal lobe as appears from the fact that this sulcus and its homologue,
the horizontal branch of the arcuate, are so constant even in brachycephalic apes.

To explain from an evolutionary viewpoint the fragmentation of this sulcus in most
