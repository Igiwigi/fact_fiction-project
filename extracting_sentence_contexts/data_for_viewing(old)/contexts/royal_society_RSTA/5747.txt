non-monotonicity. Thus, the nature of the temperature dependence of xj allows one to check
whether an antifferromagnet possesses a spontaneous magnetic moment or not. The value of
latter can be estimated by comparison experimental data for the longitudinal static susceptibility
with (2.19).

3. Kinetic theory

(a) Kinetic equation

Let us now discuss the non-stationary magnetodynamics of an antiferromagnetic nanoparticle. If
the remagnetization process is not quasi-static, there is no universal expression for the distribution
function W. Actually, one has to solve a kinetic equation in order to construct this function. The
fact is that such an equation in general form has not been derived yet.
