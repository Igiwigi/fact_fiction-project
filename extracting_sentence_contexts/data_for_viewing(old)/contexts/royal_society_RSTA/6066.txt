Following the arguments proposed in the previous sections, we can show that the imaginary | |
axis is contained in the resolvent of the operator. Therefore, we can obtain again the existence of a

semigroup of contractions, and the existence and uniqueness of solutions is guaranteed whenever 3
the initial data belongs to the domain of the operator. 1S

It seems difficult to obtain estimates for the decay of the solutions. However, we can guarantee : gS
that the point spectrum is on the left-hand side of the imaginary axis whenever b + nn? #0 for 12

every 1 €N. This fact suggests the decay of the solutions. However, a careful proof would need a
further study.
If we follow an argument similar to the previous sections, we find that

My =Jp, Mz =Jp?E, Mg = Jo (kon! + bn? + €), My =J03E 1b + nn?

Ms = Jn p3E°(nn2 + b)2(kikon® + (ako + 8k, — n2)n? + (ng — 2b + a8)n + a& — b?).

Keeping in mind that = &* — té > 0, a8 > b*, dk, > n° and b + nn? £0 for every n € N we see that : a
Mj, > 0 for every i=1,...,5. Therefore, all the eigenvalues have negative real part and the decay :2
of the solutions is expected. : S
Now, we show that the decay is not controlled by any exponential. Taking solutions of the form : S
(3.14) such that }t(w) > —e for all positive € sufficiently small, we get that @ satisfies the equation 1
