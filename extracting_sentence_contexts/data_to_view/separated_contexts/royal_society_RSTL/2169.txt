That the current is not the force which moves the pebbles along the coast, will

appear from the following reasons :

Ist. If it were 80, the direction of the motion of the pebbles would be determined
by that of the currents; but while the direction of the currents will vary with the
changes of the tides, we find that the direction of the pebbles may remain unaltered;
and also that the motion of the pebbles is continued where no current exists.

2nd. Although the velocities of the currents may not have been ascertained with
precision, yet it is known that the velocities generally along this coast, which can
posibly act on the shingles, are not sufficient to give motion to pebbles of every
dimension, which are in fact carried forward. Pit. Trans MDCCCXXXIV.
