nitrogenous crop-residue be large, and contribute correspondingly large amounts of
nitric acid tor the crops of 1883. But the crops of 1883 were also large, and they, in
their turn, would leave correspondingly large nitrogenous crop-residues ; leaving a
large proportion of the amount of nitrogen removed in the crops to be otherwise
provided for than by previous residue.

Lastly in reference to these experiments, it is seen that at each of the 12 depths,
down to 108 inches, the Vicia plots where there had been growth, contained less nitric-
nitrogen than the Z'rifoliwm repens plot where there had been no growth. The
difference is much the greatest in the first 18 inches, within which the Vicia throws
out by far the larger amount of root; but it is very distinct below this point, and the
supposition is that, under the influence of the growth of the Vicia, water had been
brought up from below, and with it nitric acid. In fact, compared with the Trifolium
repens plot, the mean for the two Vicia plots showed less water in the soil down to

108 inches, corresponding to between 6 and 7 inches of rain, or to between 600 and
700 tons of water per acre.

After this summary of previously published results we may now turn to the con-
sideration of new results of the same kind.
