and X,, Y, are also 8mall. The necessary condition is, that when « has the value
given above, y-+x must be constant, say Wg+e, Then neglecting squares of E

The value of « is arbitrary, since with any given s8urface conditions the circulation
remains undetermined. We shall chooge it 80 as to make the circulation zero. It
would be impossible to determine X,, Y, in the general cage where both & and dþ/ox
are infinite series; but in the case required in the present paper A,/A,_; is of the
order k, k being small, and the terms in A, are neglected after A, This simplifies the
calculation, and it is easy to determine the terms X,, Y, in terms of M,, N,. But it is
further greatly simplified by the fact that in the case to which we have to apply it the
velocity along the surface is already uniform to the firs order—in other words

Hence the equation determining the X,, Y, is
