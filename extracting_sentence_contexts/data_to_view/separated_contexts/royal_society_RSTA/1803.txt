The transfer of energy towards the
higher term numbers is very evident, although in the later members, H,, &c., it is not
completely established. The effect on the lighter gas is therefore the same as that on
the heavier, when the quantities of each present in the mixture are comparable. In
fact in a comparable mixture of the two gases there is a tendency in both cases
towards relative diminution of the leading lines of series, and towards, in general, a
shift of the energy of emission towards the violet. :

It is now clear that the mechanism of this effect must be wholly different from that
operative when only a small quantity of Hydrogen is present. For in the latter case,
the effect of a trace of the lighter gas on the spectrum of the heavier one is to
transfer the energy emission of the latter towards the leading members of series,
while a trace of the heavier gas transfers the energy emission of the lighter gas away
from the leading members.
