inch are gradual, and that if the maximum went to 45° C the temperature was at
or near that figure long enough to kill all puparia. It is also assumed that if the
maximum lay between 40° and 45° C, the exposure may have been long enough to
kill some puparia though not all. The daily maxima have been tabulated under
three groups to show the number of days on which the maximum was below 40°,
between 40° and 45°, and over 45°C. The results are shown in Table XXVI, in
which the soil maxima recorded outside the laboratory at Gadau for the months
from March to July have been tabulated. The figures show that in the rainless
and nearly cloudless months of March and April, conditions were lethal on nine
days out of ten. May is intermediate, and June and July may be grouped together,
for the rainfall and cloudiness were considerable. During. these two months the
soil maximum only exceeded 45° C on one day in six, but that is sufficient to kill
the puparia whose life extends to many days. In the course of tabulating the facts,
it was also observed that in the dry season the soil maximum at one inch was
invariably above the shade maximum, frequently by many degrees, but during the
rainy season it was frequently below the shade maximum.
