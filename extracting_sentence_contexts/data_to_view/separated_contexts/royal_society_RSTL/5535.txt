be somewhat different, the whole amount of difference of refraction between 0* C. and
42% C. being for A, 00317, for D, 00360, and for H, 00397. This fact is exhibited,
though under another form, in the sueceeding column, where the refractive index for A
is subtracted from that for IH; and as these lines are at the two extremities of the
prismatic image, py—p, represents the measureable length of the spectrum. It evidently
decreases as the temperature rises. The last column gives the dispersive power at the different temperatures, that is, the
