addition to R. petiolata, GOrr., which has already been figured and described from that
locality by Krpston,* two types were found which exhibit distinctive characters and
cannot be assigned to any hitherto described species. At a lower horizon in the same
neighbourhood another type of frond was found, which is probably referable to
Rhacopteris.

A definite conclusion cannot be drawn for the present to what phylum of plants
Rhacopteris belongs. The evidence suggests a relationship with the ferns. The
fertile frond is not unlike the fertile lobe of Botrychium. The sterile fronds are very
similar to the sterile part of the frond of Botrychium lunaria,+ but these features of
resemblance appear in other families of ferns as well. There is also the possibility
that Rhacopteris may prove to be a Pteridosperm, but from our present knowledge of
the group and in consideration of some additional facts to be demonstrated below, it
would seem that the evidence is perhaps in favour of a Fern rather than a Pteridosperm
connection.

Rhacopteris inequilatera, GOprErt, sp.f

The specimen which is figured natural size on Plate 16, fig. 1, was found by Mr. Kirpatrick
in a large block of grey, sandy mudstone from the upper part of the strata exposed
in Hailes Quarry, Kingsknowe, Midlothian, belonging to the Wardie Shales, Oil-Shale
Group, Calciferous Sandstone Series. The fossil is seen to consist of two fronds and a
portion of a shoot. In the actual specimen, about one centimetre more of the tops of
