This formula merely assumes that the factor multiplying the product of length,
breadth, height remains the same, whether these quantities are measured on the head
or the skull. We now turn to the discovery of linear formule corresponding to (8) of pp. 234, 236.
«Here we are met by the very obvious difficulty that unlike formula (9) the constants
Spf formula (8) change much from local race to local race. If we take the formula for
asthe Germans as being nearest akin to the English, we are met by the obvious fact
that the constants change widely when we pass from a brachycephalie to a dolicho-
‘ephalic race; the English, indeed, have a cephalic index nearer to the Ainos than
fo the Germans. Accordingly, in default of more ample data for striking a mean
‘qormula, T have inserted in (A) of p, 250, the mean values of the German and Aino
‘pponstants. We thus have :—
