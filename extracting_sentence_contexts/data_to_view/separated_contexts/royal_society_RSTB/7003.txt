It represents
rather a functional boundary, for the constitution of the body wall differs in a functionally
critical manner on the two sides of the boundary. Also, according to Darwin (1851, p. 39)
the adductor muscle is included in the prosoma. This is most fortunate, as there is, in fact,
a very sharp division both functionally and structurally between the hinder margin of the
adductor muscle and the more posterior part of the prosoma (in Darwin’s sense). In my
description I shall use the term prosoma to exclude the adductor muscle, and I shall use
the non-committal term ‘trunk’ instead of thorax. The prosoma bears on its upper surface a helmet-shaped armature of rigid chitin
(figures 4 and 5) which I call the oral cone.
