EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS.

The variations in the resistance of the eggs must be due to the egg proper and not
merely to the fertilisation membrane, since the changes which follow fertilisation follow
the same course in those eggs which do not form such a membrane as it does in
those which do.

Eggs from which the ovarian membranes had been removed by treatment for
half a minute with faintly acid sea-water do not form fertilisation membranes,
although they do develop normally. The conductivity of such eggs always
resembles that of eggs which were fertilised in the ordinary way, that is, without
previous treatment with acid. This fact, together with others established by
Exper (8) and others, shows clearly that the protrusion of a fertilisation membrane
is of secondary importance among the phenomena of fertilisation.

The changes in conductivity cannot be due to the presence of free spermatozoa
between the eggs, since the addition of as much sperm as was used in any of the
experiments to a volume of sea-water equal to the bulk of the eggs does not change
the conduetivity of the sea-water.

Tn a recent paper, Guaser (13) has brought forward evidence to show that the

* When not actually in use, the electrodes were kept immersed in clean sea-water.
