The value of this current
can in general be neglected in comparison with the current value found by dividing
the E.M.F. applied by the calculable resistance of the electrolyte. It is therefore
considered that the potential fall within the liquid can be neglected in comparison
with the sum of the potential changes in the neighbourhood of the electrodes, and
that this sum is equal in value to the applied E.M.F. The system is, in fact,
considered equivalent to a pair of condensers (supposed existent at the surfaces of
separation between electrode and solution) connected in series by a resistance (repre-
sented by the resistance of the electrolyte). For electrodes of the same nature in the
same solution the respective capacities are taken to be proportional to the areas of the
surfaces in contact with the solution. In the capillary electrometer, therefore, the
capacity of one electrode would in general be indefinitely small compared with that of
the other.
