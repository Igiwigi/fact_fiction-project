Five hundred beats corresponded to 3-333 minutes. It will be observed that in each of the experiments (1), (2), &c. in each series 1., TE
&c., the temperatures of the radiating surface are approximately equal. These experi-
ments, (1), (2), &., are in fact repetitions of nearly the same experiment, made with the 2
view of obtaining the mean rexult of several experiments instead of relying on the result
of one. And here I may remark that this was necessary, not merely for the elimination
of errors of observation, but also for that of the actual irregularities in the rising of the
mereury in the thermometer of the calorimeter. Moreover no high temperature can be
maintained perfectly stationary, but is always in a state of oscillation about a mean value.
