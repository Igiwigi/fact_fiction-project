Further, this
metaphor becomes instrumental, since each layer presents bonds with adjacent layers, resulting
in overall strong mechanical cohesion. We note that those bonds—as well as their distribution—
are irregular. This is attributed to the fact that, as a coil forms, it crosses its own path, effectively
resulting in the formation of a bump. As a result of this effective roughness, only a fraction of
the thread contacts the neighbouring layers. This result contrasts with conventional prints, where
a single thread follows the exact path of the nozzle, and where each layer fully bonds with the
previous and following layers, strongly stiffening the resulting structure [23].
