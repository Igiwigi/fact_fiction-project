1. Introduction
Author for correspondence: In this paper, we make an attempt to provide
Reuven Segev a mathematical setting that is general enough to

encompass both stress theory in continuum mechanics
and classical field theories of physics. In fact, the
proposed setting generalizes both. In the continuum
mechanics context, we propose a weak formulation of
the fundamentals of continuum mechanics that does not
use the traditional notion of a material point. In the
context of field theories, we present a weak formulation
of p-form electrodynamics. Here, by ‘weak’ we mean
that we use the geometric counterpart of the theory of
