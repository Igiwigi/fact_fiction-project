polyoxyethylene polyphosphonate used in the cement industry. This molecule strongly adsorbs
on the calcium sites of the particles through the PO3~ phosphonate ionic groups of the molecule.
The polyoxyethylene tail is composed on average of 44 oxyethylene groups, CH2-CH2-O, which
has a quite good affinity with water; in the following, we shall call this molecule PPP44 [13]. We
see in figure 1 that even at a volume fraction as high as 57%, the yield stress ty is quite low (around
15 Pa) and that the dynamic viscosity is constant, so the whole rheogram is well represented by
the Bingham law: t = ty + nay. At 6 = 59%, the behaviour is already quite different, with a strong
increase in the viscosity above a shear rate of 60s~!, followed by a domain with small oscillations.
Then at = 61%, there is a strong jamming transition with a sudden decrease in the shear rate
followed by a regime of strong oscillations around a mean value of 35 sl. Finally, at 62%, there is
also a jamming transition but at a lower shear rate. If we increase the volume fraction still further,
at some given value close to 66% the system is completely jammed and there is no flow at all
when the stress is increased. In fact, the complete blockage of the system whatever the imposed
stress will depend a lot on the plasticity of the particles, the roughness of the walls of the cell and
the non-dilatancy of the gap under large applied shear stress.

The DST transition can be more or less abrupt. For instance, in figure 2 we have reported the
jamming transition for carbonyl iron particles (average diameter 1.2 1m), for calcium carbonate
particles (average diameter 41m) and for silica particles (average diameter 51m). The three
suspensions are in water, but the first two are stabilized by 0.2% by mass of the molecule PPP44,
whereas there is no surfactant with silica whose stabilization is due to its natural ionization
