Various optically thin hazes from disequilibrium species and photochemical products
reside above the CH, cloud. Below the water cloud, other equilibrium cloud layers are predicted
to form [29,30], depleting the atmosphere in refractory elements above their condensation regions. In fact, of all the equilibrium species predicted to be present in the atmospheres of Uranus and
Neptune, only Hz, He, CH4 and HS are directly detected spectroscopically, while everything else
that has been observed is believed to be produced from disequilibrium chemical processes. The atmospheric constituents observed during the Voyager 2 era and earlier are discussed in
several reviews [15-19]. Since that time, H2S has been definitively detected in the troposphere of
Uranus and tentatively on Neptune [26,27], several new disequilibrium products and exogenic
species have been detected throughout the atmosphere [31-42], and refinements to previous
abundance measurements have been reported [28,43-83].
