Once again, the loss depends only on the ratio 7a//p and
the FOM should be the same expression wp/y obtained above for the localized SPP. For the long-wavelength region where the Drude expression for the dielectric constant (1.1) is
valid, once again one can use the expression for the real ef, ~ —o /w? and imaginary e/, © oy /o
parts of the dielectric constant of the metal to obtain another expression for the FOM,

It is easy to see (table 1) that the noble metals have higher values of FOM than most if not all ‘new’
plasmonic materials all the way to the far IR range, just as numerical simulations in [15] have shown. To illustrate this fact, we perform full modelling of the dispersion and propagation length in
gap SPPs for gold and InGaAs waveguides with an SiO2 core. The results are shown in figure 5. The propagation constant (effective) index 8 of the gap SPP shown in figure 5a,c remains equal to


ka for as long as a > Ap/2z and then gradually increases as the field starts penetrating the metal
(semiconductor).
