the occurrence of anomalous megaspores is accounted for. The occasional examples
of arrested inflorescences bearing a single female cone§ may possibly be regarded as
supporting PEARSON’s view.

In working out his hypothesis he compares the various kinds of bracts borne by
the cones of both inflorescences. He compares the “acute” basal sterile bracts,
occurring at the base of each female cone and at the points of branching, with the
non-vascular bracts at the base of the separate axillary male flowers, while he regards
the rest of the bracts of the female cone, both sterile and fertile, as derived from the
tissues of the proliferated nucellus.

‘The mature structure of the cone bracts had not then been fully investigated ;
the facts now described|| lend no support whatever to such a theory. All the
adult bracts of both male and female cones resemble in essentials the sterile basal
bracts; it is therefore ditticult to regard any of them as morphologically distinct
from the others, and still more difficult to draw a particular comparison between
the non-vascular bracts of the male flower and the basal bracts of the female cone.

Moreover, if proliferation explains the dichasium in one case, there seems no reason
why it should not also explain it in the other. Anomalous megaspores would be
unlikely to occur in the axis of the male cone where the ovules are themselves abortive,1
