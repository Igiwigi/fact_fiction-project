fluorescent solution, which, upon cooling, set into a gelatinous mass. “ This,”
quote W6nLER, “ consists of acid ammonium urate, coloured by a new-formed bods
which, however, is to be obtained only in very small quantity.” Almost simu
taneously with the publication of these observations, Huastwerz* described experimen
made on lines which were in all essentials identical. The latter chemist, howeve
considered the yellow gelatinous substance which separated from the tubes to }
a chemical individual, and he identified it with the compound previously deseri
by Lizsic and W6uLeER under the name of mycomelic acid. This conclusion h
been generally accepted, and, in the text-books, heating uric acid with water will
found described as one of the methods of preparing mycomelic acid.

I think it is easy to show that Hiastwerz was mistaken in the inferences |
drew from his experiments, and that, as a matter of fact, the real yellow product
the reaction is formed in minute quantity only, merely pigmenting a residue
unaltered ammonium urate as stated by W6nter. I have many times care’
repeated the operation exactly as described by Huastwerz, and I have also ve
the conditions of the process in every conceivable way, but under no cireumstane
does it seem possible to obtain more than a minute yield of the yellow substan
In spite of the small yield, however, it is possible, as will be later seen, to adduct
evidence to show that this artificial derivative of uric acid is closely related
and, in all probability, identical with the natural yellow pigment described in tl
last section.

In perusal of the original paper by Hiasrwetz, one notes at the outset that
author entirely ignored the presence of ammonia in his tubes, though, at th
