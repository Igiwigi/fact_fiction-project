varies across species. First, we show here using individual-based theoretical
models that XX/XY (male-heterogametic) and ZZ/ZW (female-heterogametic)
Subject Areas: sex-determination systems can respond differentially to temperature-induced
ecology, evolution sex reversals. Interestingly, the impacts of climate warming on adult sex
ratio (ASR) depend on the effects of both genotypic and phenotypic sex on
survival and reproduction. Second, we analyse the temporal changes of ASR

and animal societies’.

Keywords: in natural amphibian populations using data from the literature, and find
adult sex ratio, amphibians, climate change, that ASR shifted towards males in ZZ/ZW species over the past 60 years,
masculinization, sex-determination systems, but did not change significantly in XX/XY species. Our results highlight the
temperature-induced sex reversal fact that we need a better understanding of the interactions between genetic

and environmental sex-determining mechanisms to predict the responses of
ectotherms to climate change and the associated extinction risks.
