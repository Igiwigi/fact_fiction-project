vz strikes normally with an initial velocity V, an elastic half-space of Young’s modulus E; and
Poisson’s ratio v1, the quasi-static theory of Hertz [1] is still applicable if the total contact time
between the sphere and the half-space is longer than the time taken by the dilatational waves to
travel through twice the diameter of the impacting sphere.

As shown below, although the successive wave reflections’ assumption of Hertz is fulfilled
for the impacting sphere, it is clearly not the case for the semi-infinite solid. However, from the
measurement of the time of collision between a 1.59 mm diameter steel sphere falling freely at a
speed of 3.41 ms™! onto a flat end of a steel cylinder 152 mm in diameter and 203 mm in height, it
has been shown by Goodier et al. [23] that the Hertz quasi-static theory correctly predicts the total
collision time. On the other hand, the measured maximum impact load was only approximately
82% of that predicted by the Hertz theory. This discrepancy between the measured maximum
impact load and the theoretically predicted load is not necessarily due to the fact that some of the
energy is dissipated in the elastic waves, as shown by Hunter [24]. A possible cause is the loss of
energy by viscous flow and any plasticity effects.

Ignoring the above discrepancy, according to Hertz [1] the maximum impact-generated load,

Pmax, is given by
