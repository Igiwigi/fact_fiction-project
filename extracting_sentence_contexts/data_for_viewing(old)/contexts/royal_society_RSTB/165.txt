An important fact must be taken into consideration in this connection, since
it is not inconsistent with so-called “irreciprocal” conduction, namely that the
(+) induction current is more efficacious than the (—) one in producing the
after-effect. How far this distinction is related to the difference of behaviour
of the nerve itself to ascending and descending exciting currents can only be decided
by experiments specially contrived to bear upon the subject. It is, however, more
satisfactory to approach the whole subject of irreciprocity from the point of view
of irreciprocal excitation than from that of irreciprocal conduction. Such experiments
will have to deal with the production of states of anelectrotonus and catelectrotonus
in the organ. They were not attempted in the present research,

There can, however, be little doubt that the organ is thrown, by the passage of an
induction shock through its substance, into a state of prolonged excitation which
