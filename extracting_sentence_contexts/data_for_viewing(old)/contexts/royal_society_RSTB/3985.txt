he says, in his paper, that out of the examination of several thousand plutei of this

species this type of skeleton ‘ was found noticeably in embryos from the eggs of two
individuals. In one case it was found in 1 per cent., and in the other in 3 per cent.
of the plutei examined. In other cultures it occurred as a variation of much less
than 1 per cent.

“The pure cultures made in 1909 as controls for the hybridization experiments
showed an occasional pluteus with this variation, but the number never was great
enough to exclude the advisability of considering the common appearance of more
than one rod, a Hipponoé character, as an indication of Hipponoé influence.”

The fact that the lattice type of skeleton can appear normally in the Zowopneustes
larva in a small percentage of cases appears to us to require that TENNEN’ should
make a much more extensive investigation of the conditions governing its appearance
than he seems to have done. Moreover, before basing any conclusions on skeletal
characters it should be shown that the hybrid plutei are as healthy as the pure-bred
plutei of the parent species ; a few of TeNNEN?’s figures show his larvae to be obviously
unhealthy.

In his second paper in the ‘ Reports of the Tortugas Laboratory’ Trennenr (0)
gives a fuller account of his work, with numerous figures. We are not told, however,
in this paper or the first, if the eggs and sperm from the same pair of individuals
