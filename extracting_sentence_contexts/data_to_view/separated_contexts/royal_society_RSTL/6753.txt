Allow, on‚Äù the other hand, the neutralizing power belonging to the circulation of the
stomach to remain the same, but increase beyond a certain point the strength of acidity
of the digestive liquid; theoretically, digestion of the stomach's parietes would be
looked for as the result ; practically, it can be shown that this is really what occurs, as
will be seen by an experiment to which I shall presently refer. With the living frog's legs introduced into the digesting dog's stomach, it may be
fairly taken that the amount of blood possessed by the frog would be totally inade-
quate to furnish the required means of resistance to the influence of the acidity of the
dog's gastric juice. With the rabbit's ear the vascularity is 80 much less than that
of the parietes of the dog's stomach, that there is nothing, to my own mind, incom-
prehensible in the fact of the one yielding to, and the other resisting attack. No com-

parison can be drawn between the position of the stomach, and that of the rabbit's
ear, The stomach is not only in itself exceedingly vascular, but is entirely swrrounded
by equally vascular parts.
