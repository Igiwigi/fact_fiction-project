5 to results which would not easily have been obtained in any other way. The possibility
£ of preparing this body in a state of perfect purity and in considerable quantity, by a
3 series of processes, which, if not quite simple, are at least definite and certain, its posi-
= tion in the system of organic compounds, its conveniently situated boiling-point, the
5 energy and precision of its reactions, and lastly, the simplicity which characterizes these
reactions, in consequence of the absence of unreplaced hydrogen in triethylphosphine,
—whereby the formation of a large number of compounds of subordinate theoretical
interest is excluded,—all these conditions tend strongly to invite us to the study of a
body, in whose chemical relations the leading questions of the day are not unfrequently
mirrored with surprising distinctness.

It was originally my intention to put together—in one frame, as it were—the various
facts which I have collected relating to the phosphorus-bases; but the material lies
scattered in 80 many directions, that I deem it more advisable to publish these observa-
tions in a number of- shorter memoirs, which, from the nature of the subject, must be
more or less fragmentary.
