It seemed, therefore, desirable to enter a little more
fully into the analysis of the cases in which the criterion was positive but v
imaginary, and discover what types of frequency curves had escaped my attention. * The key to the solution lies in the fact noted on p. 369 of the memoir, namely, that
even if the criterion be positive, there will still be a solution akin to Type I. and not
to Type IV. if « be negative. No frequency series satisfying these conditions had at
that time come under my notice, and later, when collecting data of floral variability,
my own remark as to ¢ had slipped from my memory.
