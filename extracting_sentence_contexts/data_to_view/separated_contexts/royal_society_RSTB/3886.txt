Witson and J. P. Hitt I have been enabled
to examine the condition of affairs in embryos of Ornithorhynchus, and so far as the
facts are concerned I feel compelled to agree with Gaupp’s observations. In
Ornithorhynchus as in Echidna there are two “ pterygoid” elements. On the other
hand I feel inclined to differ from GAurp’s conclusions as to the homologies of the
elements.
