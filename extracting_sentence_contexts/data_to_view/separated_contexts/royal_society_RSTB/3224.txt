A, Bidwillii.—The cone-scales of this species are distinguished by great breadth
and by the thickness of the prominent ligule (fig. 24,1). The two scales represented
in fig. 24, L and M, show the broad and massive seed-scale with the acuminate distal
end and the broad and stout ligule (/) resting on the surface of the scale. WorspELut
lays stress on the fact that in this species the bundles of the “ bract and seminiferous
scale arise quite independently from the central cylinder of the cone-axis, and at
a wide vertical distance apart.” The course of the two sets of bundles in the
cone-seale is similar to that in A. Cookii, but there is a marked tendency towards
a concentric disposition of the xylem and phleem. Worspreri notes that two
strands of phloem-like tissues were seen penetrating the chalazal part of the ovule ;
a statement agreeing with our observations in A. imbricata.
