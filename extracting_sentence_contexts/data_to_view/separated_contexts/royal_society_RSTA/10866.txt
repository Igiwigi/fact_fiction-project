A. MACMAHON ON COMBINATORIAL ANALYSIS.

since (d/dx)' a" = n!; but once we observe the way in which d/d# operates upon 2"
we require no previous knowledge of the result to aid us in the design. Conceive «*

written as a product

LLCENN . .

the operation of d/da consists in substituting unity for # in all possible ways, and
summing the results obtained.

—e=l.sre... t+olew... baovlaw 7 oS eee

We have, in fact, to perform n operations of substitution ; let us select one of these,
say—

and denote the minor operation, by which it has been obtained, by the scheme

the suffix @ denoting that the first operation of d/dx has resulted in the appearance
of the unit. :

To obtain S (wee . . .) we have » — 1 minor operations by which z is replaced
by unity in all possible ways. If one term obtained be

z
lolen'r %

the operations by which this has been reached may be denoted by the scheme

and by proceeding in this manner we finally reach a lattice, square and of n® compart-
ments, which is the diagrammatic representation of one of the x! combinations of
minor operations which results from the operation of (d/dx)" upon x". If we transfer
the 1,,1,, . . . to the top row we see that to each diagram corresponds a permutation
of the v different letters a, b,c, . . .
