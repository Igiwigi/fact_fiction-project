Changes in continental evaporation minus precipitation (figure 16c)
for the end of the twenty-first century are very similar in geographical distribution and magnitude
when compared with the change for the PETM (figure 6a). Changes over ocean regions are
dissimilar mainly due to the differences in SSTs related to the fact that the twenty-first century
SSTs are not in an equilibrium state. Differences over ocean regions are also due to the fact that
the PETM CAM simulations employ fixed SSTs, which implies more cooling due to an unlimited
supply of water to evaporate. Finally, changes in simulated upper level soil moisture content
at the end of the twenty-first century (figure 16d) differ over North America compared with
the PETM (figure 7a), while they are similar in Asia with a large-scale increase of soil moisture
over Asia. Changes in extreme daily precipitation for the equivalent regions used in the above palaeo-
analysis (figure 17) indicate increases of 10-20% for all regions except the Spanish Pyrenees, which
experiences a 30% decrease in 95th percentile daily precipitation by 2100.
