in which the phyllotaxis differs even in the different species of one genus.

In order fo demonstrate the final descent of the internode-curve in submerged
aquatic plants, measurements were made along the stems of Hlodea canadensis and
Myriophyllum. The statistics concerning three axes of the former are subjoined :—

Elodea XVIII.
Branch 1.—6, 5°5, 4°5, 5°25, 6, 5, 5°25, 5°5, 5°25,
Branch 1a.—8, 3°5, 8°75, 3°75, 3°5, 2°75, 4, 8°5, 3°25, 2
Branch z.—9, 10, 9°5, 10°25, 8, 10, 8°75, 8°75, 8°75, 9, 8°5, 9, 7, 6°75, 5°25, 5, 7°75, 65, 6,

The shallow internode-curve of Myriophyllum showed the final descent, despite of
the fact that growth for the season had concluded (in July).

Sympodial Axes.

I was desirous of testing the graphic method as a new method of morphological
investigation, quite apart from any question of leaf-displacement. I therefore made
measurements along reputedly sympodial axes, namely, the floriferous stems of
Myposotis sylvestris and Petunia hybrida, and the tendrilliferous axis of Ampelopsis
hederacea.

In regard to Petunia and Myosotis, the results were disappointing, in that the
curves showed that the graphic method is not competent to distinguish between a
monopodial and a sympodial axis. The statistics dealing with the matter are given
