changed into a nearly insoluble resin = C,, Hz, Og, that is

Cu He of 3 0:
In like manner mastic resin when s0 heated is in part changed into C,, H,, O., that is
C, Hy oY fro =
It is reasonable to suppose that the nature of the change which takes place is the
same in both; and though I do not consider, notwithstanding the precautions adopted,
that the number of atoms of hydrogen in any of the formulz I have given for the re-
sins can be considered absolutely certain, yet there being a reasonable probability
that mastic resin A, is represented by C,, H,, O,, there is reason from the present
analogy to infer that gamboge resin is C,, Hz, Os.

One interesting and important fact may be considered as established, whichever of
these formulz be adopted, that a small change in the number of atoms of hydrogen
only, may give birth to new resins possessed of very different properties. We have
for example,

Colophony = C,, Hy O, Liebig.
Mastic A. = C,, Hy O,
represented generally by
Cy Hy-, O,
the resin of which
C,, Hzz O, is the formula, being undetermined.

And we have also
