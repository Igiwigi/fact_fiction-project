In winter, especially after dry, clear weather, the amount of air in the wood of the
trees examined was greater. The highest percentage of water was found in trees at
the beginning of the unfolding of the bud in spring. The fact that gas bubbles do occur in the region of the wood which transmits

_ ascending current indicates an important function of root-pressure, i.e., to dissolve up
and clear out the gaseous contents of such conduits as are occupied with bubbles. the autumn time the gaseous contents of the tree increase in amount, and in
spring the young buds are provided with sap, and at the same time continuity in the
watery contents of many of the conduits is re-established, so that at the beginning
active transpiration there may be a water column of as large a section as possible
existing in the conducting wood. This view, namely, that the functioning conduits must necessarily have
lumina swamped with water, is supported by another observation of STRASBURGER
of a different kind.
