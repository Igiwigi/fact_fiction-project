and it is found, in the cases which have been included in the present examination,
that a displacement of the 0 point about fifteen minutes from A will best make the
theoretical and the observed curves agree with each other.

The ratio of DC to AC is, as has been said, 12 to 5; and this, according to the
theory, would be the ratio of the lunar to the solar tide, Tf this were the case, the
spring tide measured above mean water would he 17, and the total spring tide above
Spring tide low water would be 34. The neap tide in this case would be 7 above
mean water, and therefore 24 above spring tide low water. Hence the difference of
springs and neaps would be to the height of neaps above low water springs as 10 to
24, a ratio constant for all places.

But in fact, this ratio of the excess of springs to the total height of neaps above
low water springs is different at different places: and the observations now under
consideration show in some measure the law of this difference. The ratio is smaller
when the tide is smaller. 'This appears from the observations at different places, as
arranged by Mr. Ross in the annexed Table A. We have there the following results,
taking the means of groups of places according to the amount of tide.
