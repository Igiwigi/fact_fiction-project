C. WILLIAMSON ON THE ORGANIZATION

in Lepidodendron Harcourtii; but in both cases this cylinder, which he had
designated étui médullaire, or equivalent of the protoxylem or medullary sheaf of
recent exogenous stems, was surrounded by a secondary zone of wood, developed
exogenously through the instrumentality of a cambium layer. BroneNtIarT was
unfortunately biassed by the fact that no such secondary growth existed amongst living
Cryptogams—to which group he correctly determined the Lepidodendra to belong. The existence of a secondary, exogenously-developed, vascular zone was a clear proof
in his eyes that his new plants could not be Cryptogams ; hence he referred them to
the family of Gymnosperms. and connected them with the well-known Carboniferous
plants called Sigillarie. The conclusions thus arrived at by the great French paleontologist were almost
universally accepted at the «ime when I began my investigations into these subjects,
some thirty years ago ; I soon obtained clear proofs that many of the Carboniferous
Cryptogams, unlike their lying representatives, were provided with a secondary,
exogenously-developed, vascular zone. “That this is the case with most of Brone-
nrArt’s Lepidodendra is now an almost universally accepted fact.
