Tithonia
diversifolia (Composite), which was introduced in 1851, began to spread about
fifteen years later, and in 1900 was all over the island in damp enough spots,
though its seeds have no pappus, and it spread almost entirely by vegetative
reproduction. Mikania scandens, which only began to spread about ten years ago,
is already common over a large area near Peradeniya, reaches about 30 miles along
the railway to Colombo, and has reached Trincomali down the river, and established
itself near that place. There has been ample time for any of the endemic species,
had they been really well adapted to the local conditions, to have spread to the
stage of Very Common, and the fact that they have not done so goes to show that
they are no better adapted, on the average, than their forerunners. Natural selection, again, to be effective, requires that many forms shall modify
in the same direction, as Darwin himself admitted after the criticisms of
Fieemine JENKIN. Now, this is exactly what cannot be allowed in the case of
the numerous endemic species of Ceylon, which very commonly are confined to one
spot, where they cannot ever have been very numerous, and where yet, as I have
already pointed out, they must have been evolved.
