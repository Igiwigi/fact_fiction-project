the data are at least consistent with a process that is likely to be occurring in the deep Black
Sea. Landing & Lewis [65] also modelled the equilibrium speciation of Ni in the Black Sea water
column and, as for Zn, concluded that the dominant inorganic dissolved species in the sulfidic
zone is NiS(HS)~, again as opposed to a mixture of Ni2+ (major), NiCI* and NiCO3° (both minor)
in the upper oxic zone. Again as for Zn, Fujii et al. [62] used ab initio methods to calculate the
magnitude of Ni isotope fractionation between different dissolved species of Ni. Though the Ni
sulfide complex identified by Landing & Lewis [65] was not specifically modelled by Fujii et al.
[62], they do find A Ninj2+-Ni(HS)* = +0.66%0 at 25°C. Such a fractionation is at least consistent
with the data array beneath 300 m in the water column of the Black Sea, with the exception of a
single datapoint (figure 6b).

As noted by Little et al. [48], one initially puzzling aspect of Black Sea sediment data for Ni
is that euxinic sediments are significantly enriched despite the fact that deep Ni concentrations
are not significantly lower than at the surface. The solution to this conundrum suggested by
these authors is that there is significant addition of Ni to the deep Black Sea via a benthic Fe/Mn
redox shuttle. The transport of Fe and Mn from the shelf to the open basin may occur via nano-
particulate oxides [53], which will carry sorbed trace metals. This suggestion is supported by
the presence of a fine particle layer that forms on the shelf via reoxidation of sediment-derived
reduced dissolved Mn and Fe and spreads laterally throughout the Black Sea. This layer is rich
in Mn, Fe and other trace metals (including particulate Ni, Cu, and Zn; [57]). In this scenario, the
relative homogeneity of water column Ni concentrations would imply that removal to sediment
of sulfidized species, either by scavenging or incorporation into pyrite, keeps pace with supply
of Ni from the margins via delivery of Mn oxide particulates and their solubilization in the deep
water column. The isotope composition measured for the Danube here (+1.25 %o, table 3) and the
homogeneous isotope composition of the open ocean that is likely to feed the deep Black Sea via
