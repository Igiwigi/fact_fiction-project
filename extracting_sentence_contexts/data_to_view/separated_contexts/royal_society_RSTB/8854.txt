Consistent with the SILAC result, we
found a 34—65% decrease of anti-FaslII signal intensity in the
dorsal epidermal stripes of miR-8 null embryos (data not
shown). By contrast, RP3 motor axon expression of FaslII in
miR-8 nulls was indistinguishable from controls (figure 4a,b;

these miR-8-dependent candidate effectors are not involved
in initiation of de novo synaptogenesis and lack seed sequence
homology to be direct targets of miR-8 (see the electronic sup-
plementary material and §2d). The fact that their levels
decrease in the miR-8 null background (electronic supplemen-
tary material, table S2) is consistent with miR-8 playing a role
in stabilizing target recognition during synapse development. Among synaptic IgCAMs identified in our SILAC data- n = 10), thus confirming the normal cell fate and axon pathfind-

set, two of them had been previously implicated in ISNb ing of RP3 in these mutant embryos. The morphology and
