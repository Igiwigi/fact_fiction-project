one of the shortcomings of wet processing is that the drying of complex shapes and thick
mouldings presents difficulties in part drying and solvent removal. Melt processing methods,

such as extrusion and injection moulding, are usually more challenging to implement, but this is

a step towards a larger scale use of cellulose nanomaterials. The main issues to overcome for an

efficient melt processing of CNF/CNC-reinforced polymer nanocomposites are the irreversible
aggregation of the nanofiller upon drying prior to melt processing, its non-uniform dispersion

within the polymer melt, its thermal stability, its structural integrity and its orientation. Different
strategies have been proposed in the literature to overcome these issues, but the fact remains that

the final mechanical properties cannot compete with those obtained for nanocomposites prepared

by casting/evaporation. The solution might be to adapt the coating of cellulose nanomaterials in

order to retain some free OH groups for further nanoparticle interaction. Even more ideally, it

might be to hide surface OH groups during processing with a compound that could be eliminated

by a specific treatment (thermal, radiative, ...) after shaping the product.
