DBP aims at reconstructing the transmitted signal and is typically applied at the receiver.
However, DBP can also be applied at the transmitter or split between the two. In all cases,
however, complete reconstruction of the signal is not possible because of nonlinear mixing
between the signal and the ASE noise as well as other stochastic effects such as polarization
mode dispersion [28-30]. Applying DBP at the transmitter (sometimes termed as nonlinear
pre-distortion or transmitter-based pre-distortion) or at the receiver gives approximately the
same gains (determined by the accumulation of noise from the amplifier in the link) with one
fewer amplifier noise contribution in the transmitter-based DBP case [31,32]. In the case of long
transmission distances (greater than 10 spans), this difference is insignificant. In fact, it is clear
that to reduce the contribution of noise, DBP should be split in the ratio of 50% :50% between
the transmitter and receiver. However, the greatest increase in the effectiveness of DBP can be
achieved by reverse propagation of multiple channels, enabling the compensation of not only
SPM but also inter-channel nonlinearities (XPM) [33]. The gains offered by DBP are discussed in
detail in §§3, 4 and 5.

(b) Optical phase conjugation

It is possible, using nonlinear optical processes, to exactly reverse the phase of a beam of light.
The reversed beam is called a conjugate beam, and thus the technique is known as optical phase
conjugation (also called spectral inversion). The role of the optical phase conjugator (OPC),
typically positioned in the centre of a symmetrically amplified link, is played by a nonlinear
