D 2 on the Mer de Glace, was in 1842, from August 1 to August 9, 164 inches daily ;
from Angust 9 to September 16, 18 inches; now next year, 1843, one obseryation at
the same point in August gave 16 inches; and in 1844, one observation in September
gave 174 inches. But still further, (6) the very law of flexure of the ice is the same
from year to year : a series of stations across the ice at the Montanvert gave, in 1842,
the following (simultaneous) relative velocities} :—

1-000 1332 1356 1367.
The same points being recovered in 1844, the relative motions were (by a single ob-
servation of the space moved over in five days)—

1-000 1:339 1:362 1374,
ratios almost the same but slightly increasing, which corresponds with the fact men-
tioned above (3), that when the absolute velocities are greater, the relative velocities
are 80 too, which was here the case, for the velocity denoted by 1-000 was a little
greater in the second case than in the first.

Tensions and Thrusts —The occurrence of open creyasses plainly indicates the
existence of strains in the ice of glaciers producing disruption, at least partially.
Hence some writers have precipitately inferred that the whole glacier must be in a
State of tension ; an uncertain inference surely in a problem of singular complexity,
and one which is not warranted by a more accurate analysis. Yet for a time rival
theories seemed poised on the inappropriate question, © Are glaciers in a state of in-
ternal tension or compression ?” Eyen if the glacier moved as a mass of fragments,
therefore without tension, the cohesion must first have been broken before it could
