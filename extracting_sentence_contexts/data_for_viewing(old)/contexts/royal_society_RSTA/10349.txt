solution containing the ThX gives off a large quantity of emanation, showing that
the power of giving an émanation belongs to the product ThX. Now it is found
that the quantity of emanation given off by the separated ThX decreases according
to an exponential law with the time, falling to half value in four days. The rate of
production of emanation thus falls off according to the same law and at the same rate
as the activity of the ThX measured in the ordinary manner by the « rays. Now
this is exactly the result to be expected if the ThX is the parent of the emanation,
for the activity of ThX at any time is proportional to its rate of change, 7.e., to the
rate of production of the secondary type of matter by the emanation in consequence
of a change in it. Since the rate of change of the emanation (half transformed in
1 minute) is very rapid compared with the rate of change of ThX, the amount of
emanation present will be practically proportional to the activity of the ThX at any
instant, 7.e., to the amount of unchanged ThX present. The observed fact that the
hydroxide regains its power of emanating in the course of time ig due to the
production of fresh ThX by the thorium, which in turn produces the emanation.

In a similar way, excited activity is produced on bodies over which the emanation
is passed, and in amount proportional to the activity of the emanation, 7.e., to the
amount of the emanation present. This shows that the active deposit, which gives
rise to the phenomenon of excited activity, is itself a product of the emanation. The
evidence thus seems to be conclusive that ThX is the parent of the emanation and
that the emanation is the parent of the deposited matter.

physical properties which differentiates it from the preceding and succeeding products.
