Esyer considers that “ according to von Brunn’s observations we should expect to
find here, both outside and underneath, the remains of the epithelial sheath, as the
lengthening of the root is still in progress,’

(My own observations in man show distinctly that the epithelial sheath is secithi
in these positions, both outside and underlying the forming root, and it seems difficult
to understand why von Epyer’s preparation did not show it.)

C. S. Tomes (4) says : “ Several observers have laid stress upon the occurrence of
cells upon the surface of the cementum deep down in the sockets, which are unlike
osteoblasts, but are obviously epithelial cells. It is claimed by von Bruny that the
epithelial sheath of Hertwig, from the enamel organ, extends far below the region
where enamel is to be found, and that it is, in fact, co-extensive with the dentine,
thus necessarily interveriing between the dentine and the cement-forming tissue. He
describes the connective tissue bundles as growing through it to attach themselves to
the dentine, and thus cutting off the remains of the enamel or gan into small isolated
groups of cells, which are to be found here and there in the adult alvelevental
periosteum.”

These isolated groups of cells were considered by G. V. Buack (13) to be portions
of a lymphatic system, and not the remains of the Sheath of Hertwig.

C. Tomes further says (4a): “ Several writers, notably voy Brunn and Battowrrz
(15), hold that the primary function of the enamel organ is that of determining the
form of the future tooth, even going so far as to suggest that its calcification to form
