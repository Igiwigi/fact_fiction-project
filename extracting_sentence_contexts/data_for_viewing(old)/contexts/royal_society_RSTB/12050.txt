measurable fitness benefits (0.009 + 0.001 s.e. for pho84 and
0.003 + 0.001 s.e. for trk1). We found that the fitness of the
pho84/trk1 double mutant (0.015 + 0.001 s.e.) was higher
than the expectation based on the sum of fitnesses of single
mutants (0.013 + 0.001 s.e., figure 2), although the difference

Next, we compared the mutual information statistic MI;
for each gene pair (i,j) in the dataset to its respective null dis-
tribution (see Methods; electronic supplementary material,
figure $3). We identified a significant genetic interaction
between two genes if the p-value for their MI was less
than 0.003. At this cut-off, we expect to observe 18.8 interact-
ing gene pairs under our null model, but in fact we observe

Thirty-three significant gene pairs comprise 42 unique (c) Structure of genetic interaction networks

genes (electronic supplementary material, table S1).
Interactions between functional variants might be
expected to exhibit allele specificity. We examined the
identity of independently derived mutations in the top five
most significant putative interactions (electronic supplemen-
tary material, table S2). Three of the nine genes in the top
five pairs showed evidence of repeated loss of function as
