groups) replacing porphyritic pyroxene. These lie in a fine matrix rich in biotite like
that above described. This portion of the specimen seems to be a fragment of
andesite in the tuff. The rock is crossed by little veins filled with recrystallised
hypersthene. It presents many points of resemblance to the contact-altered andesites
of the Cheviots and of Lorne.

Quartz Andesites.

In the ash beds of the 1902 eruptions there are a limited number of andesitic rocks
which present some remarkable characters which seem to indicate that they have
undergone alteration of an unusual type. These rocks are milky white or pale grey,
often with dark patches which represent the ferro-magnesian minerals. Many of
them are brecciform; in fact, they look like whitened or bleached tuffs. It is
dificult to prepare microscopic sections of them, as they fall to pieces when being
mounted.

Under the microscope they prove to be full of quartz which occurs only in the
matrix and not as phenocrysts (Plate 26, fig. 5). The original basic felspars of the
andesites remain, though small grains of quartz may form along their margins. These
felspars often show intense zoning and have much the same characters as those of
the andesites and hypersthene basalts. The primary olivine, augite, hypersthene,
