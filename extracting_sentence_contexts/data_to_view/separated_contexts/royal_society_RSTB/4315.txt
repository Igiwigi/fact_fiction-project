The prejudicial
effect of a high water-table had already been demonstrated by AupgBEAU and
Grpson, when the present author pointed out that if a rising water-table was also
injurious, the two together would account for all the known features of the yield
deterioration which the Egyptian cotton crop was showing. It was, however, by no
means easy to carry conviction in this matter. The fact that fields could be found in
which the plants were loaded with ripe bolls, although the water-table had risen above
the soil-surface, so that these laden plants were standing in a lake, was considered
strong evidence that a rising water-table might be highly beneticial. The Terraces Experiment was planned by Mr. Huaues in order to obtain data on
this subject, but the plot yields were not conclusive, on account of soil-disturbance,
and our knowledge of daily flowering was not then sutlicient to enable the author to
interpret the data obtained in the observation rows.
