(a) Basic Measurement of First btalon—The method adopted in the present work
for comparing the wave-length of light with a material standard of length is based
largely on that used by Benoir, Fapry and Perot, loc. cit., with some modifications.

The initial step in the procedure is the optical determination of the number of waves
of some known radiation contained in the distance between the semi-reflecting surfaces
of a Fabry-Perot étalon. The Fabry-Perot étalon consists of a pair of mutually
parallel semi-silvered glass or quartz plates, held at a fixed distance apart, and inter-
ferential methods are well established whereby this distance may be measured in terms °
of waves of light. There is, however, a limit to the mirror separation which can be
standardised by these methods, imposed by the fact that complete disappearance of
interference phenomena takes place when the mirrors are separated by more than a
certain distance. This is brought about because, owing to the Doppler effect, if for
no other reason, ideally homogeneous radiation is unobtainable. Accordingly, the
initial measurement in the Benoir, Fapry and Prrot determination was applied to an
étalon of approximately 1/16-metre separation ; but in the present work the étalon
separation or length is increased to about 1/12-metre, thereby leading to a greater
relative accuracy in the basic measurement. It is considered that the slightly decreased
