He remarks that © the policy of changing the nomenclature may well be doubted, and ought not
to be entered upon without the clearest conviction that, by 80 doing, error of 80me Kind is being
eradicated.” No better illustration of 8uch an error could be found than his statement that Gaurocrinus
is primarily distinguished from Glyptocrinus by possessing five sub-radials.” This name was given by
DE KoxINCK to the 80-called parabasals of Mis, © afin de faire comprendre qu'ils alternent avec les
radiales;” and since * the presence or absence of sub-radial plates is regarded of special generic import-
ance” by Mr. MiLLER, we are led to conclude that the © basals ” of Glyptocrinus (MitLes), in which
sub-radials are absent, do not alternate with the radials. But this is exactly contrary to the fact! Sub-
radial plates, alternating wiih the radials, are invariably present; and it is the radially situated under-

- basals which may be *present or absent.” In the former case Mr. Mites calls them basals, which
name he also gives to the snb-radial plates when there are no under-baals.
