Sof water, this compound, when heated with fuming sulphuric acid, undergoes a per-

Ifectly analogous transformation.

3 From the comparative facility of its preparation, acetaimide offers peculiar adyan-

Stages for procuring the new substance in large quantity. The chief difficulty which

Apresents itself consists in operating with the right proportions of acid and amide.
Distillation of equal volumes of dry acetamide and ordinary Nordhausen acid, for
instance, gives scarcely a trace of anything but acetic acid and sulphate of ammonia.
The most efficient proportions we found to be two volumes of amide to three yolumes
of acid. The distillation should be pushed very far, in fact until the product of
distillation is accompanied by sulphurous acid. The solution of the solid residue
may at once be saturated with carbonate of barium ; it will be found, however, more
economical to treat the liquid with finely-powdered Carrara marble until the free
acid be neutralized, and to reserve the pure carbonate of barium, which is s0 diffi-
cult to wash thoroughly, merely for decomposing the sulphate of ammonium towards
the end of the process. "Lhe liquid must be boiled with excess of the carbonate until
