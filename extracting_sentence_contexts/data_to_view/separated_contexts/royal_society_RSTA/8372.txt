K. Hor in
1915-16, but owing to most of the notes of the observations having been lost during
the return of Dr. Hor to Switzerland, and to the fact that the measurements could not
at that time be made over the intermediate range of temperature between room
temperature and hydrogen temperatures, the work was entirely repeated by me. Where the notes are still available, I have added the results obtained by Dr. Hor to those
obtained later, so that a comparison may be made between the two.
