depend merely upon the potential difference at the small electrode, but also upon the

except that the anion in one is iodine, and in the other chlorine. Until the potential
difference reckoned from the solution to the electrode reaches a certain value the
effect of the anion upon the surface tension (7.¢., in determining the mode of transi-
tion from the solution to the mercury) is appreciable; but this effect gradually
diminishes and finally disappears, as is shown by the fact that the form of the curve
(beyond 4000) is independent of the nature of the anion.

From this point of view it is obviously futile to consider that the highest point of
the iodide curve corresponds of necessity to zero potential difference between the KI
solution and the mercury electrode, since it might equally well be argued that the
highest point of the curve obtained with KCl at the capillary corresponded to zero
potential difference between the mercury and the KCl. If there is no appreciable
potential difference between the KI and the KCl both results cannot be true. The
potential differences in the two cases (maximum surface tension) must differ by about
0:2 volt, or else the potential difference between 4n KI and 3n KCl must be about
0°2 volt.
