Notably, despite
the measured hysteresis, the glue did not show any visible
signs of plastic deformation. Throughout the entire return
to resting length, the sample appeared taut. In fact, when
the glue was manually stretched, then released, it snapped
back to its original shape almost instantly, as an elastic
band would. Note that these findings were for samples that
were not taken past the yield point at a strain of 5. The line-
arity during extension, the extent of hysteresis, and the shape
of the stress-strain curve were also the same in preliminary
trials at a strain rate that was roughly ten times greater
(0.5-1 s~?).
