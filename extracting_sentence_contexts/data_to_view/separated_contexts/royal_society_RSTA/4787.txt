In
standard space-time physics, both this symmetry and the breaking of it are obscured. Once it
comes into clear focus with twistor coordinates, one may hope to distinguish and inter-relate
the different aspects of conformal symmetry breaking. There is the breaking of symmetry due
to the fact that amplitudes are measured ‘at infinity’. Length scales associated with infrared and
ultraviolet regularization also require breaking conformal symmetry. Gravity breaks conformal
symmetry in a different way.
