Z The conduction of heat by alloys may be considered under three general heads :—
S1, Alloys which conduct heat in ratio with the relative equivalents of the metals
ZSmposing them.
52. Alloys in which there is an excess of equivalents of the worse conducting metal
er the number of equivalents of the better conductor, such as alloys composed of
and 2Sn; 1Cu and 3Sn; 1Cu and 4Sn, &c., and which present the curious and
Wexpected rule that they conduct heat as if they did not contain a particle of the
(iter conductor ; the conducting power of such alloys being the same as if the square
bl which we were examining was entirely composed of the worse conducting metal.
not less remarkable fact is that the alloys of a series such as those of 2 equivalents
bixmuth and 1 of lead, 3Bi and 1Pb, 4Bi and 1Pb, 5Bi and 1Pb, all conduct the
Same, viz. about 1:9, the various increasing quantities of lead exercising no influence on
the conductibility of the alloys. The results obtained with this class of alloys are most
important to engineers ; for it will be seen in the case of the alloys of brass and bronze,
that no increase is gained in the conductibility of an alloy by increasing the quantity of
* good conductor ; nay, in many cases it would be a decided loss, unless a sufficient
® od of the better conducting metal be employed to bring the alloy under the third
ead.
3, Alloys composed of the same metals as the last class, but in which the number of
equivalents of the better conducting metal is greater than the number of equivalents of

the worse conductor ; for example, alloys composed of 1Sn 2Cu; 1Sn 3Cu; 1Sn 4Gy
this case each alloy has its own arbitrary conducting power; the conductibility of
an alloy gradually increases and tends towards the conducting power of the better con-
ductor of the two metals composing the alloy.
