arm has taken place almost entirely from the proximal epiphysis, as the new bone
has been interposed between the proximal epiphysis and that portion of bone which
grew from the transplantation. All but a minute portion of the distal epiphyseal
cartilage was destroyed at the time of the osteomyelitis and, consequently, little
growth in length would be expected from this extremity.

The increase in length of the diaphysis, which has occurred from the proximal
epiphyseal cartilage, may be taken as an index of the amount of growth which
usually occurs from the proximal humeral epiphysis.

DATA BEARING ON THE INCREASE IN LENGTH AND BREADTH OF Bone.

These facts corroborate and supplement some of the deductions made by Joun
Hunter from experiments performed by him on the lower animals. He bored
two holes in the tibia of a pig, one near the upper end and the other near the
lower; the space between the holes was exactly 2 inches. A small leaden shot
was inserted into each hole. When the bone had ‘increased in length by the growth
of the animal the pig was killed, and the space between the shot was exactly
