But, as these
are cases never likely to occur in practice, and from the nature of the subject
must be perpetually varying, it is better to adopt a general and sure guide for
determining the moment of coincidence: and had I not pursued this plan, I
$hould in many instances have been led into considerable error,

The are of vibration has always been observed by means of a diagonal scale
affixed to the clock case; and the divisions can be easily read off to the hun-
dredth part of a degree. The scale is 7 inches distant from the pendulum,

* The experiments with the long cylindrical rod (No. 21) form an exception ; as, in this case,
only one side of the rod could be seen in the yacuum tube,

+ I have also adopted another suggestion of Professors Airy and WarweL, by removing the dia-
phragm from the inside of the telescope, and placing it between the pendulum of experiment and the
clock pendulum. It is, in fact, attached to the clock case ; and is not only capable of being moved
in every direction, for the purpose of adjustment, but also of being enlarged or contracted, to suit the
different pendulums employed.

and a proper correction has, in each case, been applied to the arc for the pro-
portion which this distance bears to the distance of the telescope from the pen-
dulam.
