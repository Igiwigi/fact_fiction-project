Quantum corrections in the theory of
gravity will change this picture at distances of the order of the Planck scale. Familiar fundamental properties such as locality only appear at much larger
scales. In fact, there is now much evidence within string theory—usually referred
o as ‘holography’—that in the end geometry itself is an emergent quantity. The
classical laws of gravity only appear in the limit where the number of degrees
of freedom of the underlying quantum theory is taken to infinity, very similar to
he emergence of the macroscopic laws of thermodynamics out of the microscopic
description of statistical mechanics. The definite mathematical formulation of
such a concept of ‘quantum geometry’ is however still far away.
