Tt will be seen that in both figs. 9 and 10 there is substantial agreement between
the observed seasonal variations of /;,° and f;,° and the theoretical curves strongly
supporting the view that the ionization at noon varies with the solar altitude as
expected according to an ultra-violet light theory ofits origin. It is noteworthy that,
at the season when the sun just failed to rise at Troms6, no Region E or Region F,
echoes were obtained, but that, at midwinter, echoes from about the height of
Region E reappeared, although there was no corresponding reappearance of
Region F, echoes. It will be noticed that the measurements of fp,° at Troms6 are
comparatively few, partly owing to the fact that its occurrence there is indicated by
a very ill-defined maximum on the (P’, f) curve and partly due to the possibility of
its being missed altogether in one of the 0-25 Mc./sec. steps in which the frequency
range of observations was covered. However, the little evidence we have supports
the view that this region behaves at Tromsé as could be predicted from its behaviour
at Slough according to the ultra-violet light theory. The corresponding results for Region F,, the main upper region, are shown in
figs. 11 and 12.
