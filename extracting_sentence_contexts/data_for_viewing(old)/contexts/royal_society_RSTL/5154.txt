the auricle by a single trunk ; there it is mixed with the imperfectly atrated blood
from the sKin, and propelled again by the ventricle along the arteries as before.

Thus then we find here a systemic circulation divided into two portions, one
general, the other partial ; the latter is combined with a portal circulation. It is from
this hepatic course, in which the blood is most completely deteriorated, that it is sent
to the branchiz, and being returned thence to the heart, joins the current of the
general portion of the circulation in the auricle. This part of the circulation Seems
not to have been hitherto noticed in the Nudibranchiata, and in 1845 we first pointed
out the fact of the blood being returned to the heart, both from the skin and the
branchiz in Doris.

From what has been here said, it will be observed that we have assnumed the skin
Qin Doris to be to some extent an agent in respiration. That it is 80, seems to be a
Â© fair inference from these facts following ; that a large quantity of blood traverses it
S on its way to the heart continually; that although in most species the skin is stiffened
S by spicula, it is nevertheless sufficiently delicate to admit of the necessary changes
S taking place through it; and that in some, as in D. pilosa, this membrane is very
=80ft, and clothed with numerous soft and delicate papillze, which, whilst they ma-
DSterially increase the extent of surface, are well adapted to the above purpose; that in
5 this last, as in the majority of the species, even the most spiculose, the whole of the
2 mantle, and even the foot itself is covered with vibratile cilia. Moreover, if the skin
