is exercised. The rapid rates of diffusion required for such action do actually exist
in the wood-parenchyma cells,

It appears that the terminal branches of trees at heights of from 22 to 44 feet
above ground exhibit little or no power of bleeding in spring. Possibly in such
trees the pumping action is only used or developed in the wood of the older stems, or
is only exercised when transpiration is active, and the water columns in the vessel
attain a definite size relatively to the wood-parenchyma cells. The importance of the
Jaminâ€™s chain in the vessels is that it renders a staircase pumping action possible,
and enables the water to be maintained in them in a labile condition, ready to flow
to any point where moderate suction is exercised. This pumping action being a
diffuse, and probably regulated action, need not produce any high pressure of exuda-
tion at the terminal branches of tall trees, which, in fact, appears always to be absent
at high levels.

kindness in reading and criticising this paper before printing.
