The defining condition of glm is expressed as follows. The small parameter € is regarded as a [3
fictitious time, and the perturbation map £ is constructed as the flow at ‘time’ € of a vector field, Dk
q say; that is, 2 (x, t,a,€) is the solution of : =

and t is treated as a fixed parameter. The glm condition is then
q=0. (4.6)

Although superficially similar to the GLM condition (4.1), (4.6) is fundamentally different in
that it is an intrinsic statement, applicable to any manifold and independent of any coordinate
choice.
