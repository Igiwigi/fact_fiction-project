hollow cylinder. Either the youngest, first formed tracheids were pushed asunder by
the centrifugal pressure of the growing and multiplying cells of the young medulla
developing in their midst (a schizogenetic process), or they were absorbed (lysigene-
tically) under the influence of the same pressure. In the first case, all the relations
of contact and propinquity between the primary vessels or tracheids composing the
bundle must have been subjected to a continued succession of changes; because not
only had the primary vessels, &c., to enclose a larger area than previously, but they
had to allow the intercalation of a succession of newer additional vessels supplied
from the investing meristemic cortex. This latter necessity is demonstrated by the
fuct. that, as the vascular ring increased in diameter, enclosing at the same time a
growing medulla, the actual number of its component vessels likewise increased.
My present conviction is that the schizogenetic hypothesis is most in harmony with
the known facts; but, should further investigations fail to support this conclusion,
which I scarcely conceive to be possible, we must then fall back upon the second
hypothesis. In doing this we must conclude that all the vessels or tracheids seen in
fig. 8 were doomed to undergo absorption, and thus make room for the young medulla
of fig. 9, and that, in like manner, the successive vascular rings of figs. 10-12 had but
a temporary existence ; the only permanent vessels being those of fig. 15, b, after the
formation of which the development of the exogenous zone, d, always appears to have
arrested the further expansion alike of the medulla and of its investing vascular
cylinder in these Lepidodendroid plants.* The objection, in the present case, to this
