To quote the words of
BunseEN and Roscor: “ It is perfestly useless to collect the electrolytic gas in a large
vessel, then mix it with the impurity, and afterwards to allow the mixture to pass
through the apparatus, for there is no possible means of collecting this pure mixture
of hydrogen and chlorine in large masses, and again forcing it out in a given

direction.” In fact, any operation with the gas mixture is sufficient to alter its
properties. The only method of procuring reliable results is to evolve the impurity
required from a second electrolytic vessel and to pass it continuously through the
apparatus together with the normal mixture for some days, using the same current
for producing the hydrogen and chlorine and the impurity. However, even under
