But a more serious difficulty arises here. If we examine
the solar diurnal seasonal harmonics it is found that they are in fair agreement with
the theoretical values from (73), except in regard to phase. The seasonal harmonics
in the lunar variation are, in fact, nearly thrice as great compared with the annual
harmonies as in the solar variation. This is immediately evident in the initial data
of this paper (cf Tables TIT.(a@) and ILI. (y) with VI.(e) and VI.(d)), and the
following ratios of the solar and lunar seasonal harmonics E,”" show the same thing :—
