Communicated by Professor Huxuey, F.R.S. Received February 28, —Read March 21, 1861. IF a paper read before the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh, in March 1859*, I
Shave drawn attention to the fact, not before noticed, that in Mammalia the lateral
vmasses of the ethmoid always lie edge to edge with the dilated part of the yomer, and
Suro usually united with it to form one bone. T have shown that in the human subject
Sthe sphenoidal spongy bones represent, in a disrupted and altered form, the plates by
Owhich in other mammals this union is effected; and these plates I haye ventured to
Seall the ethmovomerine lamine.

= A further inquiry into the variations of these bones and their deyelopment has not
only confirmed my former statements, but led to other conclusions of most important
Emorphological bearing.

> It will be convenient to consider, in the first place, the typical connexions of the
Byomer in the mammal. We shall then examine the peculiar modifications which the
—Zvomer, ethmoid, and intermaxillaries undergo in the human. suwbject.
