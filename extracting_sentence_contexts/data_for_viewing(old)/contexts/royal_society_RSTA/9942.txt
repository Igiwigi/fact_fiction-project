from § 8""'¢ = 8", and from the given difference equation simultaneously. On the
other hand if any of the first (n—1) differential coefficients are unknown at a the
summation from column to column across the table cannot be carried out, and so the
step method is impossible. The conditions for stepwise integration of partial equations
are not so simple and require investigation.

§2°2. As an example of stepwise integration, let us take the equation for diffusion
in a tube, o0d*h/dx* = dd/ot. In the first place, if ¢ =F (x,t) is a solution of
0'h/da*? = dd/ot, then ¢ = F (ax, a’ot) is a solution of the given equation. So we
need only concern ourselves with 0°¢/0.c* = d¢/dt, and the results will apply to bodies
of any linear dimensions and any uniform diffusivity. Let us suppose the boundary
conditions are: ¢ = 0 when « = +4 for all values of t; ¢ = 1 for all values of « when
t= 0; in fact the familiar case of a uniformly heated slab, the faces of which are
suddenly cooled. The method of this example is so simple that it can hardly be
novel. It is introduced to show how easy it sometimes is to obtain approximate
integrals by arithmetic of equations usually treated by complex analysis. We draw
up a table with a row for each 0-1 of # and a column at every 0°001 of ¢. (The reason
for making the time step small will appear later, §3'2"1.) The given boundary values
are next inserted.
