The conditions governing elastic breakdown in ductile materials have been the subject
of many elaborate investigations. Many theories have been based upon the results
of these investigations, and experimental results can be adduced in support of all of
them.* Unless the refinement of the experimental methods, or the legitimacy of caleula-
tions based upon the results, are called into question, the diversity of the theories
proposed is evidence that some factor has not been taken into account ; some factor,
that is, not directly related to the magnitude of stress and strain. The conditions are,
in fact, very imperfectly understood. The theories of failure in the ease of ductile materials which have been most widely
accepted in this country are the shear stress theory, usually known as Guxst’s law,
and the strain energy theory proposed by Haieu.f According to the former the
elastic limit is reached at a certain definite value of the maximum shear stress in the
material, That is to say, it is dependent upon the difference of the greatest and least
principal stress

s, and not upon their absolute magnitudes, or upon any elastic constant
of the material. The strain energy theory, on the other hand, regards the value of
