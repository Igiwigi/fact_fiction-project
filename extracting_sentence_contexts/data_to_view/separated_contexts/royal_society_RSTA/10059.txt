To compare the constants with KoHLRAuscH's figures, we note that

p= 3(1+n), or a= fp-1


THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS. 159

For p KoHirauscu gives the values

KCl, p = 3°280, NaCl, p = 2-649,
which gives for » the values
KCl, n = 1:187, NaCl, n = 0:766,

For the tangent of the inclination of the curve at and near the origin we have for KCl the value 0°39,
and for NaCl the value 0°25. These agree well with the diagram. The accurate empirical law deduced by KoHLRAUSCH is, in fact, not sensibly different in the part near
the origin « = 1 from the Van ’t Hoff law for which p = 3. That is, in the region where, from the
present point of view, ioni¢ size and viscosity may be regarded as constant, VAN ’r Horr’s law, there
equivalent practically to 1-a@ = const x m, is to be taken as the starting point for substances of the
class here considered.
