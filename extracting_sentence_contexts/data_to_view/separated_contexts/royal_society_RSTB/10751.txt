Nevertheless, it is worth emphasizing that the imper-
fect mimics in these experiments were non-rewarding, and it
is unclear whether imperfect Batesian (rewarding) mimics
would enjoy such survival advantages in this system over
the longer term (see §4). Sherratt et al. [19] extended their
design to include two-trait mimics and no-trait novel prey,
this time using humans as predators, with similar results. However, the fact that novel prey were frequently avoided in
these experiments indicates that predators do not simply
learn to associate bad outcomes with certain traits, but that
they also learn to associate good outcomes with certain
traits. The presence of alternative prey has long been recog-
nized as an important factor influencing model—mimic
dynamics [50], so the preference of predators for ‘safer’ foods
in an uncertain world may help imperfect Batesian mimics
to persist in the longer term. As with the above studies, Rubi & Stephens [48] found
that colour trumped pattern when both were equally reliable
indicators of profitability.
