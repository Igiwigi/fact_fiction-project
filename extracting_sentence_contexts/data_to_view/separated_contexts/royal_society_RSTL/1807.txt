This pile is only in action when the poles are not connected ;â€”
voltaic action does not exist unless the poles be connected. The experiment
of Dr. WoLLasToN in which he decomposed water by common electricity might
seem at variance with this reasoning. But this decomposition is totally unlike
that produced by yoltaic electricity; for, as Dr. WoLLasToxN remarks, a mixture
of oxygen and hydrogen rose from each of the fine metallic points, a fact which
shows that the decomposition was produced in a manner essentially different. The decompoxsition in this experiment seems to have been effected by the me-
chanical agency of the electric fluid. The fine electric dart shooting out from
the invisible gold points may have actually cleayed a molecule of water which
happened to be fayourably situated, and thus its oxygen and hydrogen were
disengaged at the point where the mechanical cleavage took place #,
