maximize the complexity measure, the statistical complexity grows nonlinearly as the Shannon :

entropy becomes higher. Moreover, the 20 different neuronal rhythmic activities are more much [4

Cracking the neural code involves finding synchronization patterns and meaning in the a

noisy activity of cell ensembles. Despite the fact that neuronal ensembles may show oscillatory .

cycles allowing one to establish a coding of temporal relationships between groups of neural

elements and between neural elements and the environment, this system is far away from being

stationary, as it is subject to dynamic changes of external stimuli and thus phase resetting. A

proper quantification of the dynamics of the neuronal activity is important for understanding the

essential mechanisms of brain encoding, and to gain knowledge of how information is processed

through the brain. As non-causal mutual information fails to distinguish information that is
