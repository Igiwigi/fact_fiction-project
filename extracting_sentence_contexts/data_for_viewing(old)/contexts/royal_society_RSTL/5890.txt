'= With regard to the affinities of the Brachiopods, it is impozsible not to be struck with
S the strong resemblance that exists between the organization of these animals and that
© of the Tunicata and Polyzon. In the first place, they are all three, with a few excep-
S tions, attached to foreign bodies; and in all, the respiratory organ is appended to the
mouth, serving at the same time the purpose of 8ustentation. The intestine has a
© neural flexure in the Brachiopoda and Polyzoa, and the arms of the former are con-
Z structed upon the same plan as those of a Hippocrepian Polyzoon, as is at once obyious
2 on the examination of the lophophore of Plumatella, for instance. It is interesting to
5 mark the gradual change of these organs from their simplest form to their full and
2 complete development in the Brachiopoda. Tn the lower forms of the Polyzoa the cirri
or tentacles are arranged in a simple circle around the mouth, but in Fredericella the
'Z base upon which they are supported is angulated a little at each side. In Plumatella
= the angles are produced 80 as to give to the base a horseshoe form; in fact, to provide
3 two rudimentary arms, along both sides of which the cirri are arranged in a single
= $geries. In the next step in the development of these organs the cirri of the two sides
Z are approximated, forming a close-set double series; the arms are much elongated and
E spirally coiled, and they are thus at once transformed into the brachial apparatus of the
= Brachiopod: the arms of Lingula and Rhynchonella are complete, only they are turned
© forward instead of backward.
S Therdlation of the two forms is als0 manifested by the muscul
Z retractors and the opercular muscles of Paludicella seem to be
A adjustor muscles, their position being very similar; and it is also interesting to find
that their function is not altogether different, for in addition to the retraction of the
polype, they have the power of depressing and moving from side to side the lophophore,
much in the same way as the adjustors move the shell in the Tt vrebratulide upon the
