(a) Rheological characterization of polymer solutions

We first studied the rheological properties of polymer solutions (figure 1). The steady state
analysis (figure 1a,b) demonstrated apparent yield stress and strong shear-thinning behaviour,
both phenomena more intense for solutions of alginate and chitosan (Alg+Chi sample) than
for solutions of alginate (Alg sample). Both the apparent yield stress and the strong shear-
thinning behaviour are manifestations of the entanglement of the polymer chains that constitute
the solution. In addition, SA has a pKa as low as 3 even in strong acidic media, and thus it can
be expected that it will be dissociated into Na* and the negative alginate ion in the Alg + Chi
sample, whereas chitosan has an ample number of amino groups (pKa around 6.5) that tend to
remain protonated at acidic and neutral pH [14]. As a result, in the mildly acidic conditions of the
Alg +Chi sample, electrostatic attraction between alginate and chitosan molecules is expected.
This fact justifies the one order of magnitude larger values of shear stress and viscosity for
Alg + Chi sample with respect to Alg sample despite the similar total concentration of polymers.
This electrostatic attraction between alginate and chitosan can be better induced from the analysis
of the viscoelasticity of the samples (figure 1c,4). As observed, the Alg sample demonstrated the
liquid-like behaviour typical of polymer solutions, characterized by values of the loss modulus
(G”) larger than those of the storage modulus (G’) and dependence of both moduli to increase
linearly with frequency in a double logarithmic plot (figure 1d) [15]. On the contrary, Alg + Chi
samples demonstrated a behaviour typical of weak gel, with G’ slightly larger than G” in the
LVR, and a less pronounced increase of both moduli with frequency—note that LVR is defined
from amplitude sweeps (figure 1c) as the region of low values of the shear stress amplitude, for
