These numbers are independent of the change of
Solume by reduced pressure. If equal yolumes of the same sample of coal-gas were
Econsumed in London and Mexico, the illuminating effects would be as 100 : 46-2, the
Hemperature being the same in both cases. E An inspection of the above three series of observations, reveals the fact that the rare-
faction of air, from atmospheric pressure downwards, produces a uniform diminution of
Slight until the pressure is reduced to about 14 inches of mercury, below which the dimi-
Snution of illuminating power proceeds at a less rapid rate, This uniformity of relation
between pressure and luminosity will be more clearly seen from Plate XIX. diagrams 1
d 2, in which the luminosity is represented by the ordinates, and the pressure by the
Aabscisse measured from the origin B. If therefore the laminosity were simply propor-
tional to the pressure, the curve of luminosity would coincide with the diagonal drawn
from A to B in diagram No 1.
