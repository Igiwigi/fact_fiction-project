As
the convolution layer number increases, the level of detail in a feature map decreases as the
number of convolution and pool layers increases, i.e. successive feature maps are blurred by
their predecessor convolution and pooling steps. The feature maps reveal aspects of the images
of interest, including the hole, and edge features. The fact that edge features have been learned
by the feature maps in this example raises a concern as to what the corresponding convolution
filters are learning. While the assumption is that labelled example images are presented to the
CNN in order for the model to learn the difference between signal and noise, there is a potential
disconnect as to what in the images is being used to learn that difference. It is important to check
that the model has learned to address the intended problem.
