which may fairly be compared with one another is traced in the Table (p. 82). It will
be seen that the organisms increase with increase of cubic space up to 250 cubic feet per
child, when there is no further increase, The marked diminution above 300 cubic feet,
shown in the Table, depends on the observations made in a private school which was
scrupulously clean. The results are therefore not comparable with those obtained in

Board schools. The diminution with cubic space below 200 cubic feet will recall the
similar diminution with increase of carbonic acid above a certain point. Possibly
filtration through the air-passages may be again the explanation here. This is a
point which we intend to investigate further.

In the case of dwelling-rooms, pp. 71-72, the micro-organisms decrease as the cubic
space increases, but this must be largely due to the fact that other sanitary conditions
improve as the cubic space increases, Above a thousand cubic feet there is a slight

increase, not very easy to explain. In mechanically ventilated schools the micro-
organisms decrease with increase of cubic space (p. 82), which is nevertheless quite
in accordance with the filtration hypothesis.
