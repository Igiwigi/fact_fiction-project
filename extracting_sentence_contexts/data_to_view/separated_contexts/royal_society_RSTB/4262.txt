In both glands, cortical and medullary regions of
apparently identical constitution are recognisable, in both Hassall’s corpuscles are
developed, and in connection with both accessory epithelial bodies may be present. *
It would appear then that we have here a remarkable case of parallelism in
histological differentiation between two glands, one with an epithelial basis largely
ectodermal in origin, the other with a purely entodermal basis, and the question arises
what significance are we to attach to this phenomenon? In this connection the
bearing of the facts above set forth on the much discussed question of the origin of
the “lymphoid” cells of the thymus (referred to elsewhere in this paper as
lymphocytes), which, after all, form the characteristic and essential elements of the
fully developed organ, is perhaps worthy of brief consideration. If, as certain
observers (amongst whom may be mentioned Brarp (2), Prenant (44), Svéur (59),
Bet (3)) hold, the “lymphoid” cells arise in situ by the transformation of certain of
the cells of the original epithelial basis, then the parallelism between the cervical and
thoracic thymus becomes still more remarkable, since in the former these cells would
be mainly (Trichosurus) or entirely (Pig and Mole) of ectodermal derivation, whilst in
the latter they would be purely entodermal and at the same time histologically
indistinguishable in the two glands. But if, as various other observers (HAMMAR (21),
Maxinow (35), and others) maintain, the thymus lymphocytes are to be regarded as
immigrant elements which arise in the surrounding mesenchyme and only secondarily
migrate into the epithelial basis of the gland, then the exact derivation of that basis
becomes a matter of secondary importance, since it is possible to conceive of it as
derived indifferently from either the ectoderm or the entoderm and to regard the
differentiation of the gland as primarily induced by and dependent on the immigrant
elements.
