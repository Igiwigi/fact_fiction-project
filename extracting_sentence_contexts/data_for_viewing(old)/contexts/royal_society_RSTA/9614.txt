The vibrations of greatest wave-length are put in evidence, both in the compressible
and incompressible mass, by the displacement of the surface. A vibration in which
the displacement is proportional to a zonal harmonic P, may be thought of as having
a wave-length approximately equal to za/n. In accordance with the principle that
vibrations of great wave-lengths are most effective towards instability, we should
expect the lowest values of n to give the vibrations which first become unstable, and
this is, in fact, found to be the case. But here a very real distinction enters between
the compressible and the incompressible mass. In the incompressible mass vibrations
of order Â» = 1 are non-existent, the displacement being purely a rigid body displace-
ment; in the compressible mass vibrations of order n = 1 can certainly occur, and so
might reasonably be expected to be the first to become unstable.

It is in point of fact known that the incompressible mass becomes unstable through
vibrations of orders 2, 3, ... in turn; it is found that the compressible mass also
becomes unstable through vibrations of orders 2, 3, ... in turn, the vibrations of
order 1 failing completely to produce instability. The reason for this apparent
anomaly can, I think, be traced in the following way. Ina displacement of order 1
any spherical layer of particles will after displacement be spread uniformly over
another sphere excentric to the first. The gravitational force produced by this
