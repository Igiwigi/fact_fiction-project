MOTT ON HEMISECTION OF

draw up the non-paralyzed leg, and oftentimes without looking remove the clip, is a
proof that in these cases the muscular sense was not lost in that limb; we should
therefore expect @ priori that it was impaired or lost in the other, but the paralysis
would prevent us finding out. I shall now consider the evidence afforded by experiments upon other animals, and
also the clinical and pathological evidence afforded by disease and injury of the spinal
cord in Man,

Before doing so I would point out that these experiments, which I have made upon
Monkeys, are more valuable than like experiments made upon other animals, for the
following reasons :—

(1.) The structure of the nervous system in the Monkey approaches much more
closely that of Man than Rabbits, Dogs, Cats, &c.

(2.) Monkeys have, by the tests I have applied, shown much more conscious mani-
festations of feeling, by the use of the hand in the removal of the cause of irritation,
than other animals of a lower type are able to do.

(3.) These experiments have been made with strict antiseptic precautions, and the
wound has always healed by first intention, The line of incision in the cord (if the
animal has been allowed to live a sufficiently long time) has been filled up by fibrous
tissue. I have not mentioned the fact previously, but I now take the opportunity of
stating that J have not found new nerve fibres at the seat of lesion, thus agreeing with
ScHIEFFERDECKER,* Gourzt and Frevspere, and Homén,{ and opposing the results of
Navyn and Ercuorst. The literature relating to experiments upon animals of a lower zoological type than
the Monkey is enormous. Dogs, Cats, Pigeons, Pigs, Guinea Pigs, Frogs, and Rabbits
have been used for experiments, and a variety of lesions have been produced with
a view of determining the paths of conduction.
