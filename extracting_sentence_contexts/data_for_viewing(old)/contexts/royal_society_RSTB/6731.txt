separated from it by any of the sheaths. The surface of the axon of the giant cell is
smooth and is enclosed in a tight sheath of the type already described in the peripheral
nerves of cephalopods (Young 1936; Bear, Schmitt and Young 1937), composed of
collagenous fibres with, presumably, an inner myelin-like layer and, certainly, a
“protoplasmic” sheath next to the axon. The sheath does not fit tightly on to the
cell body and dendrites, however, but is separated from the cell surface by a space
occupied by the closely packed end feet (fig. 4 and fig. 25, Plate 43). No sheath
elements intervene between the surfaces of synaptic contact, the boutons are closely
pressed against the cell surface. But there is no complete continuity between the two:
the substances of bouton and dendrite often stain very differently, so that it is quite
clear that they do not mingle. Moreover, in many preparations, a narrow space, a
few microns in width, appears between the end foot and the cell surface. This space
is probably an artefact, but the fact that the two members of the synapse can separate
in this way indicates the absence of mingling of their substances. The full implications
of this arrangements are discussed on p. 494. The most interesting feature is the presence
of a discontinuity such that an impulse passing over the bouton would not be expected
to have the same effect on the dendrite as it would have on a portion of neuroplasm
with which it was fully continuous.

A further interesting point is the occurrence of fuchsinophil granules at the synapses.
These are best seen after fixation in Flemming’s fluid and staining with Mallory’s
stain. Numerous red granules can then be seen in the region occupied by the end
feet (fig. 25, Plate 43). Many of the granules lie actually within the end feet, others
appear to lie in the fluid between them, but may have been extruded during post-
mortem changes. Similar granules have been seen in the end feet on the Mauthner’s
