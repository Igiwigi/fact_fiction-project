Those included in our series average from ‘04 to ‘05 per cent. of citric-acid-soluble
phosphoric acid—almost identically the averages found for the various corresponding
barley soils. That this is indicative of superabundance of phosphates is evident from
the fact that another plot (not analytically examined) receiving the same dressing of
mineral manures, but receiving half as much again ot nitrogen (600 lbs. ammonium
salts per acre) has consistently yielded considerably larger crops. We seem thus in a
position to say that the limit of phosphatic sufficiency, for cereal crops, is somewhere
below °04 per cent.
