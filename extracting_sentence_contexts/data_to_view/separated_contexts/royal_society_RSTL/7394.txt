A. GAMGEE ON THE ACTION OF NITRITES ON BLOOD. 625

same physical characters; in all the O free hzmoglobin has apparently linked itself
to a molecule of O, CO, and N, O, respectively, the stability of the compound being
least in the case of the O- and greatest in the case of the N, O,-compound. All these bodies, and preeminently the O-compound, appear to be examples of a class
of bodies which stand, as it were, on the boundary line which separates chemical from
physical combination—to be, in fact, examples of the class of 80-called molecular com-
pounds. Like other molecular compounds their composition varies greatly within certain
limits, and is influenced by cireumstances and conditions which have no action on che-
mical compounds proper”. That a body possessing such a very complicated molecular structure as hemoglobin

Should present numerous points of attachment, as it were, for the linking-on of snch
b-> A active, condensed bodies as the nitrites, is more than probable, and it is not remarkable
E that, as in the case of other combinations of a molecular kind, such as the union of salts
& with their water of crystallization, of bases with sugar, of albumen with metallic oxides,
S of iodine with the compound ammonias, the amount of the simpler body added to the
=Smore complex, should vary within wide limits.
