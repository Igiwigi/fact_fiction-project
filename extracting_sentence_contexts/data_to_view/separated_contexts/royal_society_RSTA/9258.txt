It fixes the slope of

the curve and is a pure function of the configuration of the molecule of the lubricant. For normal acids, alcohols and paraffins the expression aM can be written in the form
¢ (x — 2) where x is the number of carbon atoms in the chain. In this form, it shows
the remarkable fact that each such carbon atom produces the same effect up to a chain

used is :-—

Paraffins .. ‘sy .. CH,;—CH,— ..... .— CH, — CH.
