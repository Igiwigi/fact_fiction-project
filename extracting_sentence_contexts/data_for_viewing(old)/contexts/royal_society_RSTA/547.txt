Using (4.9), together with tre¥=y and tre(Vgz, —I1z,¥)=0, we infer the estimates
J2x10) #tre(V — ¥)=0 and Joxto) #tre(I1gz,¥ — Vz,) <0. We now express the last term on
the right-hand side of (4.23) as follows:

T=) | #(trelg,(V —¥)— tral —#) = > TK).

We next examine separately the cells K € Zg according to the value of ¥ — w in Sx, a discrete
neighbourghood of K. The issue at stake is that the interpolation operator /7.z, hinges on local
averages over a discrete neighbourhood Sr of T = K x I. This leads to the following three cases.
Case 1: ¥ — w > Oin Sx. In this situation, # =0 in Sx and thus Z(K) vanishes.
Case 2: ¥ — wy =0 in Sx. The fact that 7g, is max-norm stable locally yields

The case s < } follows immediately from (4.12). For s> we use that & = VY —W solves an
«-harmonic extension problem and then its conormal derivative 0¢& = — limy—o yh sayé is well
defined. We realize that dyé|y=0 vanishes in 2 because s > 3, which together with (4.12) allows
us to derive (4.24). This, combined with (4.11), implies the following bound:
Z(K) < |Z ll~agiire a, (% — Y)IIt~ay IKI S IK INF.

As hy = (#.Fy)-7/"* and y > 3/2s, we thus conclude Z(K) < |K|\(#.Fy)~2/ "+.


Case 3: tre ¥ — wy is not identically zero nor strictly positive in Sx. In view of (4.10), we have
