Again, take the alloys of the third class. Although amongst the gold-silver and the
gold-copper alloys we find no brittle ones, yet we know how hard gold, silver, and copper
become when we alloy them with 8mall quantities of other metals, and that they lose
more in proportion of their ductility, &c., by: the addition of sxmall than of large quan-
tities of strange metal. From these facts, we need not be surprised at the rapid decrement of the conducting
powers of the metals belonging to Class B, when alloyed with any other metal; for
when we find most of their other physical properties more or less greatly altered by
traces of foreign metals, might we not also have expected this result 2 For where we
ee no marked change in most of the other physical properties of alloys, as in the first
class and in the second, on the one side of the curye, there we have nearly their calcu-
lated conducting powers. It would be very interesting to determine quantitatively some of the other physical
properties of the alloys, to see whether in them these properties will deerease in the
same marked manner as the conducting powers, when a metal belonging to Class B. is
alloyed with any other metal. 1 intend therefore to commence, especially with this

view, with the conducting power for heat, in order to see if the classification of the
metals and alloys given in this paper will hold good for any of the other physical pro-
perties, as well as in the hope of finding out the cause of the behaviour of the metals of
Class B. when alloyed with traces of any other. On looking at the specific gravity of
alloys*, we find that they cannot be classified as above, but in all probability the above
classification will hold good for their tenacity, hardness, conducting power for heat, &c.
