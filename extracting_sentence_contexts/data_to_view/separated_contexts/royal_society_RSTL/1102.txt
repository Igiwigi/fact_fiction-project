The excess of eleven cubic inches, in this case, no doubt
arose from the person not having been in the habit of ex-
hausting his lungs, s0 that they contained more when he
began than when he left off; his lungs appeared to be of
greater capacity than those of the usual operator. :

100': 8.5 : : 9311 : 281.43. Consequently 281,43 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas were
given off in 55 minutes. In this experiment we meet with a remarkable fact, viz. that
as much carbonic acid gas was given off in 55 minutes, as in
the former experiment in eleven minutes ; $0 that it appears,
whenever atmospheric air is taken into the lungs, it returns
charged with about 8 per cent. carbonic acid. The faster re-
spiration is performed, the more carbonic acid is given off, and
consequently the more oxygen consumed : in this instance it
was given off at the rate of fifty-one cubic inches per minute. Thirteenth Experiment.
