The first HHG experiments used picosecond [3] or large-aperture
femtosecond lasers, where plasma and ionization depletion effects complicated the interaction,
making quantitative comparisons with theory inaccurate [88]. By contrast, the application of
intense few-cycle pulses for HHG not only generated dramatically higher harmonic orders and
higher conversion efficiency, this also immediately resulted in quantitative verification of the
Ip +3.17 Up cut-off relationship [89,90].

Figure 5. The attosecond dynamics of HHG was first clearly revealed through the effect of the cycle-by-cycle optical phase of
a few-cycle driving laser pulse on the spectrum of high-harmonic generation. (a) The effect of simple chirp on the spectrum. :s
The fact that the harmonic spectrum sharpens into narrow spectral peaks with a positive chirp on the driver is the result of the _
re-collision spectral phase, from [81]. (6) Through control of the driving pulse shape, the intensity of a single harmonic order is
can be enhanced, demonstrating a useful control over attosecond dynamics that directly confirms that the full spectrum of HHG a
is mutually coherent. This optimization is effected by applying a nonlinear chirp to the pulse that compensates for chirp of the : S)
HHG emission resulting from the re-collision process, from [82]. : tS

(b) Phase-matching

Importantly, the use of few-cycle pulses for HHG, combined with novel waveguide methods
to control phase-matching in the HHG process, also revealed how HHG is phase-matched. The
understanding of HHG as a discipline within nonlinear optics, including both propagation/phase-
matching and the (single-atom) nonlinear susceptibility, has proven to be a much tougher
problem than the basic mechanism of emission, and has progressed systematically over the
past 2 decades.
