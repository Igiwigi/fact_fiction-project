Similar manner ; it may, however, be due to a slight inclination of the muscle-rods
towards the axis of the fibre; in this manner they would appear to overlap one another,
and 80 produce the effect of radiating lines.

= V. Ground-substance of Muscle—Cause of the Cross Stric.

[5 The muscle-rods do not form by their agglomeration the muscular fibre, but are
Sdistinetly seen to be imbedded in a ground-$ubstance, the characters of which we must
Enow discuss.
S This 8ubstance appears, as a rule, in longitudinal view not homogeneous, but, as
Lbefore mentioned, to consist of alternating disks composed of two distinct materials, of
Swhich the one in which the heads of the muscle-rods lie is bright and clear, whereas
Sthat which contains their shafts is dim. 'The fact that the bright transverse bands are
= often seen to present a slight bulging opposite each of the rod-heads, and that when
the latter become of the same diameter as the shaft (8 as to be no longer seen as distinct
objects) the bright bands also entirely disappear, would seem to show that the bright,
appearance is an optical effect produced by the presence of the globular heads,
That such an explanation is a possible one is shown by the following experiment :—
A strong solution of gelatine is taken, and having been rendered fluid by heat, a few
drops of oil are added and the mixture is thoroughly shaken for a few minutes. By
