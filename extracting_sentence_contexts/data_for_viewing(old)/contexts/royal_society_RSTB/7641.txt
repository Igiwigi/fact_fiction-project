essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves
appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns
on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also con-
sidered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two
dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary
waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis.

The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote
may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any
new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account
for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathe-
matics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be
experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in
text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.

1. A MODEL OF THE EMBRYO. MORPHOGENS

In this section a mathematical model of the growing embryo will be described. This model
will be a simplification and an idealization, and consequently a falsification. It is to be
hoped that the features retained for discussion are those of greatest importance in the
present state of knowledge.

The model takes two slightly different forms. In one of them the cell theory is recognized
but the cells are idealized into geometrical points. In the other the matter of the organism
is imagined as continuously distributed. The cells are not, however, completely ignored,
