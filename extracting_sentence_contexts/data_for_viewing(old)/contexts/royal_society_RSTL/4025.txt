canos; namely, 176? Farr., that of Chandes Aigues in Auvergne. The temperature
of the hottest known thermal spring in the world, according to M. Araco, is that of
Las Trincheras in Venezuela, stated, on the authority of HumBoLpT and BoussIxoauu,
to have increased 11* since 1806 to February 1823, viz. from 195* to 206? Fanr.
Had M. Araco stated its elevation above the sea, a better comparison between its
temperature and that of Jumnotri might have been formed. It would be interesting
to observe whether any similar increment of heat takes place in the chain of thermal
springs that rise abundantly along the great line of dislocation at the southern
base of the Himalaya chain, or whether the temperature falls, as in some thermal
springs among the East Pyrenees. It is certain that the majority of the springs
strictly termed thermal, occur in India at or near lines of great faults occasioned by
the upheaving of plutonic rocks, a fact that speaks intelligibly as to the great depth
at which the earth's crust has been broken up.

Hot springs were found by Burxss in the salt districts of the Punjaub. In Tkibet,
M. Cso0ma pe Koros mentions the occurrence of hot springs between U and Ts'ang.
They are numerous in the mountains lying east from the Ma-p'-ham lake, especially
at one place, where there is a hole out of which yapour continually issnes, and at
certain intervals, as in Iceland, hot water is ejected with great noise to the height
of twelve feet. The water of the hot springs of As8am was found by Mr. J.
PrInsge to contain bitumen and sulphuretted hydrogen. One held in solution a
portion of muriate of soda. Many other warm springs are known to occur, besides
those mentioned in the register, regarding the temperature and chemical composi-
tion of which further information is desirable. For instance, those of Hummiam
