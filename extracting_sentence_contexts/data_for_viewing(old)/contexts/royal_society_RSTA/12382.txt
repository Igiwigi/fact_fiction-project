The tube was then cooled with the mercury at the same height as at the last
reading, and then, without drawing down the mercury, the tube was heated to 40°.
In this case there was no possibility of condensation of vapour on the lower part of
the tube, while previously, when readings were begun at the largest volume, con-
densation might have taken place on the lower part of the tube. If, therefore, the
high vapour-densities are due to adhesion and condensation, the value of this reading
at 40° should be lower than it was found in the first series. This is in fact the case,
as is shown by the following determinations :—

In the first series, at volume 71:1 cub, centims., the vapour density was 9°99, as
