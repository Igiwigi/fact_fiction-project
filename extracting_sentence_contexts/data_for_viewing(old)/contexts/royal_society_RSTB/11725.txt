involves how we should conceive of the relation between consciousness and
cognition. Classically, the debate is characterized by different positions: Block
himself has consistently argued that the two concepts can be empirically disso-
ciated [2-5], others argue that the two concepts, in fact, only refer to one
property [6], while others again seem to argue that they are conceptually
different but always empirically correlated [7].

This article focuses on the arguments for ‘overflow’—that phenomenal con-
sciousness (or P-consciousness) overflows access consciousness (A-consciousness).
Obviously, in order to understand the meaning of ‘overflow’, one needs to have
relatively precise definitions of both A- and P-consciousness. The definition
of P-consciousness has been heavily debated in the consciousness literature,
and most philosophers and empirical scientists seem to agree that subjective
experience, P-consciousness, refers to what it is like to be in a particular
mental state. Examples, such as the experience of the redness of red, the taste
of coffee, the sound of music, have often been used to explain the meaning
