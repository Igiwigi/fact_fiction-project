It can also be computationally demanding to provide accurate
estimates. Furthermore, once the population is partially or fully vaccinated defining population-
wide R may not suffice. There are also difficulties associated with the fact that the onset of
symptoms often happen a few days after the onset of infection, and hence, the current value
of R really represents the state of the pandemic at some point in the recent past; in the UK, the
consensus is that the current value of R is lagged by 2-3 weeks [4]. Other metrics such as the rate of daily hospital admissions have been suggested as alternative
metrics that can be used alongside R, especially in a very heterogeneous population with mixed
immunity from vaccination or from prior infection with a specific viral variant. In this article,
we develop and apply a statistical method to derive a different metric related to the daily cases,
hospitalizations, mechanical ventilation bed (MVB) admissions or deaths related to COVID-19
to track the national and regional epidemic status.
