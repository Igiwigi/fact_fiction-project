An example of such a pair, called the Schrédinger pair (pschr, 4schr), can be constructed in the
Hilbert space L?.(R) by defining the two families of operators

Py) =fy + V2x) and (eVS"A(x) =eVF(0),

having first verified that the families of unitary operators defined by these actions are indeed both
continuous unitary representations of the group (R, +), so that by Stone’s theorem they determine
unique self-adjoint operators pschr and qgchr, and that (2.2) holds.

In fact, by the Stone-von Neumann uniqueness theorem [4-6], the Schrédinger pair is
essentially unique. More precisely given an arbitrary canonical pair (p,q) acting in a Hilbert space
HH, there exists a Hilbert space K and a Hilbert space isomorphism (i.e. a unitary transformation) U
from L2(R) ® K to H, which intertwines each e#? with e*?s6 @ Ix. and each e? with ee @ I.

Another useful canonical pair is in the Hilbert space I2.(Z>9) of square-summable complex
sequences, which it is convenient to regard as the Fock space over the Hilbert space C, in the
sense of the following definition.

Definition 2.1. Given a complex Hilbert space 1, the Fock space '(H) over H is a Hilbert space
equipped with generating a family of exponential vectors (e(f))re7, satisfying

(e(f),e(g)) =exp(f,g) forall f,g eH.
