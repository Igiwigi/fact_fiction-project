Since the
concentration in the 12-day grafts was not significantly different, on the average, from
that in the 8-day grafts, this indicates that the concentration is approximately the same
in the 8- and 12-day grafts of any animal. This could be interpreted to mean either that
these cells remain physically undisturbed in the grafts during the period, i.e. a static
interpretation, or that a dynamic equilibrium is maintained over the period, the organism
keeping the level of these cells up by replacing ones which are removed or transformed. The first interpretation is made unlikely by the fact that a great increase in mature plasma
cells took place.

(d) There was a negative correlation between the concentration of lymphocytes at
8 days and the increase of total cells between 8 and 12 days (r,= â€”0-8051, P<0-02). This
could not be shown to be a mere mathematical effect. It is interesting that there were no
significant correlations between the lymphocytes at 8 days and any of the constituent
parts of the total cell increment, nor between total cells at 8 days and their increment.
