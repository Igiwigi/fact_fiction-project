than by a close examination of the Plates, in connection with the explanation just

I may here mention, that it is not my object in this memoir, to trace the tissues
investigated into a perfectly formed state ; but simply to present such of their earliest
stages, as $how them to be derived from objects having the same appearance as cor-

though met with incidentally, and recorded without remark, may not be considered
destitute of physiological interest.
