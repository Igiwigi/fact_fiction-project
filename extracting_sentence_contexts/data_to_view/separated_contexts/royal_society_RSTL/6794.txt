is an integral, but not, the general integral of the differential equation (T), it must be
the general integral of a differential equation involved in (T), but of a lower order, We
may in fact conclude that such reduced differential equation will be deducible from the
higher one by a process of integration. Let us apply this consideration to the foregoing
example. When m=—1, the equation (I) becomes

D(D—1).
