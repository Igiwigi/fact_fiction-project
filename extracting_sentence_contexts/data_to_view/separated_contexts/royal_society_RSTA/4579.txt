It should be noted that
in practice, most modelling groups will only use very few observational targets to tune their
sea-ice model, which is why tuning becomes a less relevant factor in studies that consider many
metrics simultaneously.

(e) Unclear link between past and future

The discussion of individual metrics has so far been based on the tacit assumption that we can : =
infer the quality of simulating the future evolution of a climate observable from the quality of 3
simulating its past evolution for which observational data might be available. However, the link 1B
between the model performance for a past evolution and the performance for the future evolution : a
of the system is often not clear. A trivial example for this fact is given in figure 3, where the 72
obviously ‘poor’ simulation with an increase in sea-ice cover over the period 1979-2012 becomes Dw
almost identical to the much more ‘realistic’ simulation shortly after this period. This change : Aes
in perceived quality is simply related to internal variability, but for the severe changes that the :2
climate system of the Earth currently undergoes, additionally the relevance of individual physical : e

processes is very likely to change with time. This implies that a model that did well in the past
does not necessarily do well in the future and vice versa.
