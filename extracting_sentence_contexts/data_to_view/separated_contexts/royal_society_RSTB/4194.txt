Hence it is impossible by-this method to determine the conductivity of normal eggs
(7.e., eggs developing at a normal rate) at any stated moment. As, however, the
development of the eggs in the conductivity tube is only abnormal in respect to time
(the cleavage divisions are quite normal but occur at a varying time after those in
the control), it may be concluded that the sequence of events in the two cases is
the same. The fact that the resistance can only be determined by concentration of the eggs
is an unsatisfactory feature of the method. We may assume that when the eggs are
concentrated at the bottom of the tube, their development very quickly becomes
