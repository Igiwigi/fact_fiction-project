Its length, as compared with that of the femur, is less in Man than in any other Pri-
-mate, though he is very closely approached by Troglodytes, Nycticebus, and Cynocephalus.

'The tubercle of the tibia is at its maximum of distinetness in Man, and is placed
A higher up than in other Anthropoidea.
a 'Thearticular surfaces for the condyles of the femur more completely occupy the upper
Et] surface of the tibia than in any other Primate ; and in Man the outer of the two articular
& tacets is generally more or less strongly concave antero-posteriorly.
& The exceeding sharpness of the crest is absolutely peculiar to Man.
SD "The ridge for the popliteus is more developed in him than in any other of the An-
& thropoidea, and in the fact that the posterior border of the articular surface of the

= from every other Primate.
E In the Fibulg the peroneal malleolus is not produced out into a strong process as in
