distinctly thinner in the wall, also that the number of lobes or arms is larger. The
number seems always to be decided at a very early stage, and to be due, as was
suggested (WorTHINGTON, ‘ Proc. Roy. Soc.,’ 1882, loc. cit.), to the instability of the
annular rim. Thus, in Series I., fourteen appears to be a frequently recurring number
in the earlier stages, and in Series VILL, twenty-six or twenty-eight, and in both

series the number afterwards diminishes, often by coalescence, as the annulus subsides
and thickens. This view of their origin appears to gain confirmation from the fact
that there is a larger number in the crater with the thinner walls. It is not, however,
easy, even from the photographs, to estimate the number very accurately. The
reader will best ascertain the nature of the difficulty by trying, Sometimes, on
account of the foreshortening of the front rays, these are more easily counted in
the image of the crater, that is, reflected by the smooth liquid surface in front of it.

In Series LX., we have the splash of a rough stone sphere, 1:25 centims. in diameter,
falling 60 centims., into milky water. Photograph No. 1 shows even better than
No. 1 of the previous series the way in which the liquid, from the very first, is
driven away from the sphere. The subsequent crater is very like that of Series IT.

does not seem to differ materially from the course followed in Series III. It is
