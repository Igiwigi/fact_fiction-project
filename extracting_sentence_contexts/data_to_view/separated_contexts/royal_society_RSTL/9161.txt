The above is a deseription of a Kerguelen skin in the ordinary brown plumage,
S hut whether this is the adult stage it is difficult to s2y. Many writers have drawn
© attention to the yariation in plumage in the © Nelly,” and the general opinion is
2 that the white plumage represents an albinism, but in the © Wreek of the Fayorite”
© (p. 187), the young bird is described as © grey, darker on the back,” while the adult
Z bird is said to be white. This view is borne out by the fact that the white-plumaged
2 birds haye generally some remains of brown feathers about their bodies. Dr. Kidder
E describes the nestlings as follows :—*© The down of the young bird is entirely grey
3 * in colour; the head is partly naked, and the hill, tarsi, and feet are coloured
Z © nearly as in the adult, but s0mewhat paler. The firs: fully-formed feathers are
& © similar to the adult plumage.”
