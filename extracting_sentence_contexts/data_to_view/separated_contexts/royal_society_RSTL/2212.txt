DAVY ON THE TORPEDO.

the case with the foetus of some of the Squali*, Neither have I found any fluid in
the uterine cavity at any period, excepting that already mentioned-f. The facts I have stated relative to the development of the foetus of the Tor-
pedo, though amply suflicient to demonstrate that this fish is not oviparous, are
not incompatible with its being ovoviviparous, as it is considered þy the naturalists
who have paid most attention to the subject ; yet I believe it is not strictly 80, and
that it is more correct to say that it is intermediate between ovoviviparons and
viviparous, the foetus, as I believe, deriving its support in part from the oyum, and
in part from the parent. The principal fact on which I found this belief is, that the
mature foetus is yery much heavier than the egg. In the three following Tables I
Shall give the statical results substantiating this fact. The first Table will relate to the oyum just after it has entered the uterine cavity,
or before the appearance of the embryo; the second, to the ovum after the fetal
development has commenced, but has made little progress ; and the third, to the
foetus when mature, or nearly mature, indicated by the total disappearance of the
external yolk, or its being reduced externally to a yery small bulk.
