At 8 o'clock the chimes and hour-bell of the Westminster clock were very loud. The
* acoustic fog ‚Äù had shifted its position or temporarily melted away.

An assistant placed at the end of the Serpentine sounded the whistle and pipe for
fifteen minutes without interruption. An observer at the bridge noticed the fluctuations
of the sound. Sometimes the whistle was heard alone, sometimes the organ-pipe.
Sometimes both whistle and pipe began strongly and ended by sinking almost to inaudi-
bility. Extraordinary fluctuations were also observed in the case of the bells to which
reference has been already made: in a few seconds they would sink from a loudly
ringing peal into utter silence, from which they would rapidly return to loud-tongued
audibility. The intermittent drifting of fog over the sun's disk (by which his light is at
times obscured, at times revealed) is, as already stated, the optical analogue of these
acoustical effects, In fact, as regards such changes, the acoustic deportment of the

atmosphere is a true transcript of its optical deportment.

At 9 p.x. three strokes only of the Westminster clock were heard; the others were
inaudible. The air had in part relapsed into its condition at 7 P.M., when all the strokes

were unheard. 'The quiet of the park this evening, as contrasted with the resonant roar
which filled the air on the two preceding days, was very remarkable, The sound, in
fact, was stifled in the optically clear but acoustically more flocculent atmosphere.
