The article by Taylor et al. [60] further explores the issue of effective uncertainty
communication, by examining the needs of organizations for effectively using climate forecasts. Climate forecasts are starting to outperform historical averages in predicting European winters
and are therefore becoming more widely used in organizational decision-making. However,
uncertainty arises from the probabilistic nature of the forecasts, and the fact that models do not
have perfect reliability. This uncertainty can make forecasts difficult to use, in particular, because
people exhibit ambiguity aversion (cf. [61]). Furthermore, there is a lack of empirically supported
recommendations for effectively communicating uncertainty.
