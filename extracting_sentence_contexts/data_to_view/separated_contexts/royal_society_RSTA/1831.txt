Nor does Pyykké favour a
32-column table but remains with the traditional 18-column representation (figure 7). Pyykk6’s
18-column periodic table [13], which has been featured in many articles, gives the appearance
of differing quite substantially from our current periodic table and indeed the author appears
to capitalize on this apparent difference. In fact, the only real novelty to emerge from Pyykké’s
relativistic calculations, and his proposed accompanying periodic table, occurs at elements 139
and 140, at which point the increasing atomic number sequence appears interrupted because the
j=1/2 component of the 8p shell (8p;/z) is occupied before the 6f levels. The small modification
that Pyykké proposes is the result of his prediction, and that of other authors [22].
