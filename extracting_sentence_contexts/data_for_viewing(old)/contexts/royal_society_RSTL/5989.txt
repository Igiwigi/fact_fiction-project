It will be seen how much the Deflections are reduced by this hypothesis, especially
in the case where the attenuation extends through only 100 miles. In fact, in this case
the upheaval of the mountains and the consequent attenuation below produce a slight
deviation the other way at the two further stations. The snccess of the hypothesis may
therefore, thus far, be considered to be establiched, although it remains an hypothesis
Still; and we must always be in uncertainty, not as to its answering this end, but as to
