intensities are proportional to the results thus calculated.

But in order to determine the relative energy-contents of the lines, as in (2), we
must use the formula, where n = $ or 1,

(breadth of line) (photo. intensity of line) (absolute intensity of arc)

(photo. intensity of are) (log of photo. intensity of line)"

which is the formula already deduced in this section, with the variable I, removed by
substitution of absolute intensity divided by photographic intensity in the are, to
which it is proportional. The dispersion ratio automatically cancels from the
formula in this second case, as in fact it should in the present method whenever two
magnitudes at the same wave-length, which involve a consideration of a range dd in
the neighbourhood of this wave-length, are to be compared.

(VIL) The Helium Spectrum under Different Conditions.

One of the most interesting applications of the preceding theory does not involve
the carbon are, and consists of the examination of the relative behaviour of Helium
lines under different conditions of excitation. In this case, we are not concerned with
the intensity of one line in a spectrum relatively to the others, but with the changes
of intensity of one line under different conditions relatively to those in other lines
under the same conditions. Some interesting results in this connection have been
obtained, and it is perhaps convenient to give some account of them before proceeding
