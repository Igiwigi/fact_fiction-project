No growth-change
takes places as the cones become functional, the scales remaining closely adpressed,
and there is no internodal extension in the axis. The protrusion of the “stylar
tube” does no more than lift the extreme edge of the subtending bract of each
flower, so that there is nothing that can be classed as mechanism in the cone-
structure. Hooker(1864) was so struck by this fact that he assumed that pollination
must take place when the cones were very small, no bigger than the staminate ones ;
the case of Pinus probably affording the suggestion.


118 DR. A. H. CHURCH ON THE FLORAL MECHANISM OF WELWITSCHIA MIRABILIS. From the analogy of other cone-mechanisms this retention of a closed condition in
the functional stage must be regarded as secondary, and due to the elimination of an
opening mechanism : since it is obvious that, as in other Gymnosperms, the pollen
grains once fell directly on the nucellus or in its immediate vicinity. That such
failure to open is the expression of xerophytic adaptation will be freely granted ; and
it may be noted that the essential parts of the ovule (embryo sac and nucellus apex)
now remain buried beneath about three overlapping scales, each with strongly
cuticularised epidermis and marked xerophytic structure, at a distance of 3-4 mm.
from the exterior, and thus probably beyond the reach of injurious intense light.
