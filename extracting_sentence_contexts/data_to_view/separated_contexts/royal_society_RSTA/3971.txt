From
this, a reduction in incoming solar radiation was estimated on the basis of overlapping circles. Some extrapolation of the apparent Moon position was also required during the times before and
after totality, though the impact of these is not large. The procedure as a whole is not perfect, and is further complicated by the fact that the
model uses a spherical Earth approximation, but differences between the calculated reduction in
incoming radiation and the eclipse magnitude published by NASA [17] are of the order of 1%. The
calculated ‘eclipse shadow factor’ (i.e. the proportional reduction in top of atmosphere incoming
radiation) at 0930 UTC (approximately the time of maximum eclipse over central England) is
shown in figure 1a, whereas the time series of the factor at Reading, UK, is plotted (at 5 min
intervals) in figure 1b. This has a peak of about 84%, compared with the accurate figure of 85%.
