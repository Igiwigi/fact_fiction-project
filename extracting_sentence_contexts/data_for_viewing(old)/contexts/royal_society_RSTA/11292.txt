abscissa. This is very easily done, since J is expressed in simple functions which are
tabulated. The curve is drawn for the first three undulations in fig. (2), Plate (1).
Now d determines completely the nature of the aggregate (except its volume and its
intensity). The point P on the J curve, corresponding to A, we will call the para-
metral point. Draw through P a parabola touching the axis at the origin, For all
points beyond the first few undulations a circle will suffice, or the curve drawn by a
thin lath bent to touch the axis at O and to pass through P. If x denote r/a, hx
will correspond to a point on the J curve between O and P, If P,, P, denote the
corresponding points on the J curve and the parabola, the value of y in the aggregate
at the point (r = xa, @) is given by P,P, sin*@ (note P,P, will be negative). The
velocity of propagation will depend on the angle at which the parabola and curve
intersect at P (see fig. 3,§ 20). If they touch, the angle is zero, and the translation
velocity zero. In fact the parameters of the points are the d, values. We will call

them the Q points. They are easily formed by fixing a lath at O and bending it to
touch successive loops of the J curve. It is easy to do this correct to two decimal
places, when numerical calculation will carry it to any degree of approximation desired.
The points where the J curve cuts the axis of « correspond to the ), parameters,
We will call them the R points.
Denote the points where the parabola through P cuts the J curve again by the
letters p. These points give the sizes of the shells into which the aggregate divides.
