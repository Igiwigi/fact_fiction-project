extent of the tree at the time of the wound, whereas in the course of its radial activity
the cambium passes through dormant winter periods. There are also greater facilities
for vertical distribution in connection with the currents in the tree.

When the young plant is examined for comparison with the older form it will be
seen how little evidence of response in succeeding years it shows, and how evanescent
here the wound stimulus apparently is. Any of the wound areas in fig. 4 or in the
photographs of Plates 10-13 will showt he lack of persistence of the stimulus in the
radial direction. Special attention may be directed to Nos. 5 and 7 of fig. 4, and to
Photo. 60 (Plate 13). In the latter there are only three canals in the year succeeding
the wound, and yet there is a double series of numerous canals in the wound year itself.
When the vertical extent is compared, the prevalence of local series in the young plant
will be recalled, and the further fact may be instanced that, though the wounding of
the young nursery plant (fig. 4) was very severe, none of the response to wounds was
carried into the innermost year to any great extent except in the case of the nodal
regions between Nos. 7-8, in and below which there were several severe wounds. Even
here, after the canals were established at the base of the year (No. 8), their number
rapidly decreased, as may be seen in Nos. 10 and 11. (Note the short distance on the
stem between these numbers.)

From the comparison of the responses of young and older forms, it is evident either
that the plant developes responsiveness to wounding, or that there is an accumulation
of the wound stimulus in the older parts. However the cause of greater accumulation
of resin canals in the older parts of the plant may ultimately be explained, the fact
has a distinct bearing on the phylogenetic interpretation that is sometimes put on the
