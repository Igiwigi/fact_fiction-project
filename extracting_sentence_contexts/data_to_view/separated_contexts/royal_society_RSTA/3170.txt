In
other words, one can consider that Lorentz invariance is broken spontaneously.® This possibility
opens new directions for antimatter—-matter interactions. In both cases, the couplings that I mentioned in the previous section will now modify the
kinematics of (anti)particles. In fact, one does not require a mediator to generate an effect, and one =
can take m, very large. For instance, if there is a field in the Universe such that (x,.) « 3e, then : 3S

(xp) Pyhh ody, 61)

which means that, in the point particle approximation, the action for the particle will have an 3
extra term 14

_ dx iS
+4] dtu = a at 62) 8

This term modifies the inertial mass of particles and antiparticles in opposite directions. As before, |
one can try to cancel the effects on matter fields, and it seems to me that most of the caveats of :
the previous section should be revisited.
