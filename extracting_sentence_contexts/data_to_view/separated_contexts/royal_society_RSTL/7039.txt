In the special case of
a body with two equal moments of inertia, were not the simplicity of the motion 8uch
as to render tabulation unnecessary, a distinct set of tables of double entry would of
course be employed. It is, IT think, conceivable that the supposed tables of treble
entry might be of some practical yalue in studying by arithmetical or graphical methods
the geological phenomenon of evagation of the pole of the earth regarded as a body of
irregular form, and in other dynamical problems of a gyroscopical character where an
exact determination of the effect of a given disturbing cause might be difficult or unat-
tainable. The fact that there are no essential differences in the motion of a rigid body of any
form and started under any initial cireumstances whatever, but such as depend upon
the particular values of the two positive proper fractions 9, gz, enables us at once to ee
what are the special cases which alone can arise, and whether or no there is any real
distinction to be made between the general cases of the theory. At first sight it would
seem that four essential parameters enter into the question, the ratios of the initial
values of the partial velocities w,, »z, @z, and the ratios of the constants A : B : C, the
principal moments of inertia; but one parameter is saved by the substitution of an
indefinitely flattened disk for a solid, and another by the introduction of an intrinsic
epoch from which the time is reckoned, and thus a table of treble instead of quintuple
entry is competent to represent every possible variety of conditions. The problem that has been treated of in the foregoing pages is one (and possibly
the simplest) instance of a well-defined class of dynamical questions subject to a
peculiar method of treatment, which consists in the postponement of the determination
of the absolute displacement of the moving system until after its displacement relative
to a fixed line has been preyiously determined.
