Residual Fluctuations of Zero.—These always make their appearance when the
single steady deflexion is above 1 micrometer division for 5 X 107"! ampére. We
have endeavoured to trace the cause of this fluctuation. We made a number of
experiments by heating the instrument unequally by means of gas furnaces placed in
different positions with respect to it, with the result that we discovered that the
temperature differences had a considerable effect, but not enough to account for the
fluctuations. We habitually use the instrument in a room of fairly constant
temperature, and the method of illumination cannot be charged with giving rise to
the variations ; for the lamp may be turned up so as to radiate, say, a hundredfold
as much energy without producing any increased effect. The only radiation reaching
the interior from the lamp is that which can pass through the fine scale divisions, and
this ull impinges on the surface of the mirror. The fact that the instrument is
practically air-tight, precludes the theory that external currents of air cause the
effect. Besides, there is the mill-board box coated with tin-foil, and outside that the
iron and mill-board box.

It remains to consider variations in external magnetic force, and it is to these
variations that we attribute the fluctuations observed. Our reasons are: (1) The
magnetic screen made the needle much steadier. (2) The residual unsteadiness varies
very much from day to day ; on some days it is impossible to use the instrument with
a period of more than 10 sec., and on others the zero is absolutely still and constant
during, say half-an-hour, when the period reaches 25 sec. or 30 sec., and, of course, it
always happens that these periods of magnetic peace only occur when we want to
measure comparatively low resistances. The fluctuations have, moreover, all the
