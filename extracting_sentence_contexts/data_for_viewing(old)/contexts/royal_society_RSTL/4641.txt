Tribromophenylamine {tribromaniline) is a compound differing in its nature in no
way from oxamide. Both these substances are ammonia, whose basic character has
been counterbalanced by the insertion of a powerfully electronegative radical in
the place of one of the hydrogen-equivalents. 'These two substances, when snbjected
to the influence of strong acids, comport themselves in exactly the same manner;
they both reproduce ammonia, the one with formation of tribromophenisic, the other
of oxalic acid,

The paragraphs now following are devoted to a brief account of the bases derived
from aniline by the insertion of methyl and amyl. I have not however followed out
the examination of these substances to the same extent, the principle having been in
fact sufficiently established by the formation of the ethyl bodies,

AcTI0N oF BROMIDE AND IopiDE of METHYL UPON ANILINE.
Methylaniline (Methylophenylamine).

The deportment of aniline with bromide of methyl resembles its behaviour with
the ethyl-compound. The mixture rapidly solidifies into a crystalline mass of
hydrobromate of methylaniline. Bromide of methyl being extremely volatile, I have
used also the iodide, which boils at a more convenient temperature. The action of
the latter compound upon aniline is very remarkable, the evolution of heat, on mixing
