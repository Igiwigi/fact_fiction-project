I attend in particular to the first of these, or rather to the reciprocal equation, which
will be
o=a—n+#z—2Y —3,—2C'—4B,,
which, writing therein a=n(2—1)—2þ—3e, and z=3n(n—2)—6b—8ec, becomes
o=4n(n—2)—-8b—1lle—Y—83;/—2C'—4B.
The singularity o' is not explicitly defined in SA1MON; &' is the reciprocal of &, and (as
such) it denotes the number of common tangent planes of the spinode torse and of the
torse generated by the tangent planes along a plane section of the surface; or, what is
the same thing, it is the number of the spinode planes which touch the plane section ;
that is, it is equal to the number of points of intersection of the spinode curye and the
plane section ; or, finally, o' is the order of the spinode curye. The spinode curve is in
fact for a surface of the order # without singularities the intersection of the surface by
the Hessian surface of the order 4(3—2), and is thus a curye of the order 4n(n—2),
which agrees with the formula.

S. But the formula shows that there is in the order a reduction 85+11z arising from
the nodal and cuspidal curyes of the surface, or, what is the same thing, that the
Hessian surface meets the surface in the nodal curve taken 8 times, and in the cuspidal
curye taken 11 times—a result which T had arrived at by other means, and also as appears
post, No. 44, The formula shows further that there is a reduction 2j'+3;/ +2C'+4B,
or say there are reductions =2, 3, 2, 4, for the reciprocals of a pinch-point, a close-point,
a cuicnode, and a binode respectively, Geometrically this must signify that the surface
and its Hessian partially intersect in certain curyes which are not regarded as belonging
to the spinode curve. It will at once suggest itself that for the reciprocal of a cnicnode
