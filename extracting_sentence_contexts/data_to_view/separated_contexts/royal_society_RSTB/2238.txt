That remnant of the normal tonus I refer to as spinal tonus, in
gontradistinction to the tonus described at p. 174 in this paper, ensuing on ablation of
Bho cerebral hemispheres, which I term decerebrate tonus, also in contradistinction to
hat tonus which I term decerebellate ensuing on removal of the cerebellum. The
te rigidity of paraplegia i in the Monkey is an expression of the upset of balance of
Bhe spinal tonus in antagonistic muscle-groups. I look upon its origin as of reflext
pature, and this is borne out by the fact that in my Monkeys it could, in its earlier
â€œStages, i.e., before structural changes in the muscles set in, be set aside by chemical
sinesthesia, and by applying an Esmarcu bandage to the limbs. The unequal degree
f spinal tonus, idem aliter of spinal reflex action is, in my view, of prime importance
Fn the production of late rigidity. This view appears to me consonant with, although widely removed from, that
advanced by H. Munk.
