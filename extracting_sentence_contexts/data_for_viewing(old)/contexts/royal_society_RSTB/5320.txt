(see fig. 6, column @).

A typical arbacioid triad consists of a median primary plate with, ab- and adorally,
a demiplate. In the early stages the first or orad plate is a primary (fig. 6, triad D of
each column, and fig. 9), which later becomes reduced to a demiplate. The third, or
apicad plate is, on the other hand, a demiplate from the beginning, since it never quite
reaches the perradial suture (fig. 9).

Figs. 6-8 represent three stages in the early development of ambulacrum III or V
Thus column a in this series corresponds to column 6 in the figures given in a previous
paper for Echinus (Gordon, 1926, a, p. 291, figs. 21-27). The pore-pairs are still
arranged uniserially in each column when the corona measures 2-5 mm. in diameter
(fig. 6). Pore 10 is still simple and is, moreover, incomplete owing to the fact that the
calcite on the peristomial margin has undergone resorption. The spheridium (s.) on
plate la is now situated in a depression or pit ; when first formed it is placed super-
ficially as in the imago of Echinus miliaris. Triads B and C in column a@ and C in
column b are of the arbacioid type, the others each possess two primaries and a demiplate.

Ere the test has increased to 5 mm. in diameter (fig. 7) pore 1 of column 6 has dis-
appeared completely and the second pore-pair is now incomplete. The grouping of
the pore-pairs into rows of three has commenced. Owing to growth pressure many of
the plates in the peristomial region have been reduced, e.g., plates 2a, 4a and 36 no
longer reach the adradial suture while the adradial border of plate 6b is very small.
The first tubercle in column a@ has almost disappeared although situated at some little
distance from the peristomial margin of the corona.
