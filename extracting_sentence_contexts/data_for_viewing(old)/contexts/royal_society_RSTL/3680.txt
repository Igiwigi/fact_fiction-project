It must be borne in mind, that when, in studying the mutual action of AB and
CD, we have determined the laws according to which A and D combine, we have
equally ascertained them in reference to C and B; that is to say, to take a particular
instance, if we find, on mixing ferric nitrate and sulphocyanide of potassium, that
ferric sulphocyanide is formed in certain proportions according to the relative force of
affinity and mass, we have determined this also in respect to the nitric acid and the
potash. We know indeed that for every portion of ferric sulphocyanide produced, an
exactly equivalent portion of nitrate of potash must be formed, s0 that in fact the long
curve in Plate VII. fig. 1 will express the amount of nitrate of potash in the experiment
equally well with that which it primarily represents. And not only this, but in any
such mixture, where we know the original amounts of the two salts, and the ainount
of any one of the four into which they are resolved, we have the data for determining
the amounts of the other three likewise. This may be illustrated from the reaction
Just alluded to. Suppose (which is about the truth) that one equivalent of ferric
nitrate mixed with three equivalents of sulphocyanide of potassium produce one-fifth
of an equiyalent of ferric sulphocyanide, the following is the only formula which can
represent the reaction. The amounts are multiplied by five to avoid decimals :

5(Fe, O,, 3NO,)+15KS, Cy=Fe,, 38, Cy+12KS, Cy+4(Fe, O,, 3NO,)+3(KO, NO.),
