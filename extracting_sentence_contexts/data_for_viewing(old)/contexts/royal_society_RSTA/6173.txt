being kth-order emergent implies that there is predictive ability related to interactions of order
k+1 or more. In this regard, it is to be noted that a kth-order emergent feature is emergent
for all orders j < k, and hence increasing the order makes finding emergent features increasingly
challenging. As no system of n parts can display causal emergence of nth order,> an interesting
question is to identify the maximum k at which emergence takes place—which establishes a
characteristic scale for that particular phenomenon.

A related potential misunderstanding is to believe that the ®ID framework for causal
emergence only concerns predictive ability at the microscale, without establishing a proper
comparison with a macroscale [8]. It is important to clarify that this approach to emergence is
established in terms of supervenient macroscopic variables, which may be considered emergent
depending on their dynamics and predictive power over the evolution of the system—not too
dissimilar from other approaches [5,8]. The fact that dynamical synergy enables the existence
of such emergent variables is not an assumption, but a consequence of the theory. Moreover,
this result enables a powerful method to characterize emergence: unlike other theories, the ID
approach to causal emergence can determine the overall capability of a system to host emergent
properties without the need to specify any particular macroscopic variable. Further, the ‘scale’ of
emergence is tuned by the emergence order k, which sets the measures to focus on high-order
interdependencies that do not play a role at scales smaller than k + 1 [27].

5. Applications

Despite its recent inception, the presented framework has already proven capable of providing
insights about a wide range of phenomena (see figure 2). In the following, we first present case
studies that demonstrate how the framework aligns with paradigmatic examples of putative
