instantaneous root mean square field at the muon site, y is the muon gyromagnetic
ratio and v’ is the relaxation rate of this local field. In terms of dimensional
analysis, we would say that v’ and A constitute two governing parameters, both
with the dimensions of [1/time]. The quantity of interest in transverse field wSR is
he characteristic rate of muon dephasing, A. The formal solution to the problem is

A=Af (5): (15.2)

where f is an undetermined function.

In the slow fluctuation limit v’/A— 0 and for A to be finite, we have f—>
constant. In the fast fluctuation limit, A/v’—+0 and we expect A—0. The
asymptotic form is in fact linear in the small parameter, f(1/e) ~~ «¢. The two
solutions thus become

Aslow ~ A (15.3)

formulae that are often used for the analysis of wSR data.

These formulae may be rationalized by the following heuristic argument. If
the field sensed by the muon is approximately static on the muon lifetime, then
the muons precess in phase at a Larmor frequency yB, where B, is the applied
