ROMANES ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF MEDUSZ.

to lay most stress upon the first one; for he merely mentions the 8econd method in a
short footnote towards the end of his paper, and there states that he only tried it, in
a few cases. Yet to me it seems that for the object in view the second method is much
more trustworthy than the first. I am well aware of the fact, pointed out, by Dr. Eres, that upon each contraction of a given segment of Aurelia aurita the two arms
of the 80-called © contractile zone” approximate each other, and that this gives rise
to the appearance of spontaneous action on their part. TI think, however, that this
appearance is deceptive, being caused only by the absence of resistance at the inter-
rupted part of the margin to the pressure exerted by the contraction of the immediately
surrounding tissues.
