HULL and Harpwant and by M. Rexarp þ with respect to the
phthanites in rocks of the same age in Belgium. Tt is a 8ignificant fact, however, in connexion with the chert-beds of the Irish
upper carboniferous strata that some bave been discovered filled with sponge-spicules
like the chert of the English greensand, and this indicates a similar origin for the
silica, and negatives the supposition of Professor HULL that it was deposited © from

< warm shallow water charged with silica in solution, in which chemical reactions would
Sbe at once set up, favoured and promoted by tidal and other currents.”

= TI.—Taz NATURE OF THE SPONGES PRESENT IN THE SPONGE-BEDS.
=

S As the skeletons of entire sponges, or even fragments of them, are nearly wholly
Wubsent i in the sponge-beds, a determination of the character of the sponges of which
eithey are formed must be based upon a study of the detached microscopic spicules
Swhich are indiscriminately mingled in the deposits. In the majority of cases these
Sepioules are combined with the mechanically-derived materials of the beds, and with
Zthe silica produced from their own diss0lution, into hard rock-masses, in which the
-Sform and proportion of the individual spicules are but very indistinetly and imper-
Sfectly shown on fractured or weathered surfaces or in thin microscopic sections. EUnder these conditions the knowledge to be obtained of the character of the spicules
Sis rey limited.
