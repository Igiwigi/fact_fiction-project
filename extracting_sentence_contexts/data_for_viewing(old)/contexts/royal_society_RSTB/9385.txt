activation in secondary visual cortex in the same way that
natural afferent input does [48]. It may then be that ICMS
of area 3b will only minimally interfere with ICMS of areas
1 and beyond. The power of this approach is that it exploits
the processing that takes place in upstream circuits and cul-
minates in explicit representations of behaviourally relevant
stimulus features. Of course, this feature-based tiling of arti-
ficial touch faces significant technological challenges, some
of which are discussed briefly below.

for example, by splitting one array five ways, witha relatively  &
small set of electrodes impinging upon each digit represen-
tation. In fact, interfacing with just the thumb and index
finger tips might go a long way towards improving the func-
tionality of prosthetic hands. Such a modest number of
electrodes will likely limit the spatial resolution of the artificial
touch, and eliminate any possibility of restoring a wide range
of tactile sensations. Regarding spatial resolution, a hard ceil-
ing is set by the spread of stimulating current, which radiates
out hundreds of micrometres to multiple millimetres away
from the electrode tip over the detectable and safe range of
amplitudes. In the experiments described above, we never
tested whether two adjacent electrodes evoked spatially dis-
tinct percepts. Therefore, it is unclear whether the bottleneck
on spatial resolution is current spread or electrode spacing.
