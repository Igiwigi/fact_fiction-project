by the total drainage area, i.e. by the number of holes and their cross sections. aes

The blockage of the VC, i.e. the obstruction of some of its holes and even of its interior : _
(lumen) by cells and macromolecules present in the CSF, is the most common cause of shunt a]
malfunction. This problem has, in turn, several potential factors, including a wrong placement : 2
of the catheter in the ventricle. In this work, we consider only obstruction factors related to the : S
CSF flow characteristics in VCs, thus amenable to the methods of computational fluid dynamics : 3S

(CFD). According to the literature, flow characteristics are one of the most important factors of VC
obstruction [6-9]. To illustrate this point, let us mention that, in standard VCs, between 50% and
75% of the CSF volume flows through proximal holes, i.e. holes located on the segment closest to
the valve (or furthest from the tip of the VC), therefore, downstream of the other segments. This
fact increases the shear stress at the proximal segment (hence, the likelihood of obstruction there
[10]) and, moreover, makes critical any obstruction at its interior.

Designing VCs less prone to obstruction (thus, with a longer expected lifetime) is crucial for
the treatment of hydrocephalus. A first step towards the numerical study of the CSF flow in VCs
was done in [6] using CFD in two dimensions. This work was generalized to three dimensions in
[11-15], where some of the authors of this paper examined how variations of the hole geometry
and configuration affect the flow rate distribution per segment and the shear stress at the holes.
To this end, the geometry of manifold VCs was modelled in minute detail and the steady solution
of the general Navier-Stokes equation was computed in a domain containing the VC under
stationary boundary conditions. Based on these results, we formulated a number of basic VC
design principles in [14].
