The height at which the gradient direction is attained is given by putting v = 0 in
(12). If H, be the height in question

A, sin BH, +A, cos BH, = 0
* Owing to the fact that ~/p depends on the wind force we should evidently expect more consistent

results when the observations are grouped according to wind velocity. VOL. CCXV.â€”A. D
