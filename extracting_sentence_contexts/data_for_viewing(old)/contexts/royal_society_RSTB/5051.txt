rotula remain problematical.”

On the assumption that the first cone is similar to the succeeding ones (7.e., of double
origin), DEVANESEN (1922, p. 479) writes, ““ The homologues of the urchin tooth are
to be looked for among the bristles carried by the mouth-angle plates in star-fishes.
If two such bristles get flattened, assume a cone-shape and are pushed between the

mouth-angle plates, thus becoming partially internal, we have the rudiments of an
urchin tooth.” Moreover, he puts forward the suggestion that the rotule may be
modified odontophores, but admits that the great impediment to this view is the fact
that, while the latter are interambulacral, the former are ambulacral. It is very
unlikely that five single inter-radial ossicles (odontophores) should have, in the course of
“evolution, assumed a radial position. Therefore Sonuas’ view—that the tooth is an
odontophore which has acquired a persistent root—is preferable.

At one stage in the development of the tooth of Echinocyamus (Tuten, 1892) the
first cone is furnished with thorny projections. This might suggest that the first cone
is distinctly larval. But it must always be borne in mind that it forms, as it were, the
foundation of the whole tooth. From the description of the tooth of a young specimen
of Goniocidaris given by Lovin (1892), it seems as if the lamellze were all simple in this
case, neither does SPENCER (1904) mention a double series of lamelle in the tooth of
Paleodiscus ferox. Thus the primitive form of the Echinoid tooth consisted apparently
