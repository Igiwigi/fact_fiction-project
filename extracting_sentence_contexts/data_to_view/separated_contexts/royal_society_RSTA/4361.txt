The quantity of unabsorbed hydrogen
was ascertained from the known capacity of the apparatus (6°30 cub. centims.), its
temperature, viz., 0° C., and the pressure indicated by the manometer. The deflection of the mercury meniscus in the capillary tube of the calorimeter was
corrected, when necessary, for the slight errors due to the fact that the bore of the
tube was not quite uniform. The results are given below in tabular form. Hear of Occlusion of Hydrogen by Palladium Black.
