Similarly, the same conditions apply for the stable manifolds inversely :3
in time. In fact, this stability can be used to calculate heteroclinic orbits in a much more a
stable way than by using Hamiltonâ€™s equations. It suffices to take advantage of this structural
stability and the fact that heteroclinic (or homoclinic) orbits lie on stable and unstable manifold
intersections [52]. An important consequence of this manifold stability follows from the association of phase
space areas to classical actions [53-55]. Given that the unstable manifold is accurately constructed,
then if the endpoints of a heteroclinic (homoclinic) orbit are known, as typically happens
in semiclassical methods, so is its classical action by measuring the area.
