mammal species were projected to incur a relative loss in
suitable habitat with respect to the counterfactual outcome.
The number of species with negative impacts increased
to 59.7% when considering threatened mammals only

By minimizing human population density within
additional PAs subject to the constraint of achieving
ecoregion and country targets, this PA expansion plan inci-

(ii) Targets for threatened species

The global PA network expanded to adequately protect
threatened species increased the ESH of terrestrial mammals
relative to the counterfactual of no additional protection for
61% of the species in this group; the average increase was
10% (figure 2b). PA impact was positive for 79.2% of threa-
tened mammals, and the average improvement relative to
