familiar taxonomic groups.

2. When you are both male and female

Here, we will mainly discuss simultaneous hermaphrodites
(hereafter simply referred to as hermaphrodites) in fungi
and mobile animals in which fertilization requires direct
contact between mating partners. While some aspects of her-
maphroditic fungi and mobile animals are also applicable to
sessile hermaphrodites, including angiosperms, we discuss
those in §§3—-5 as these groups have some unique properties
due to the fact they never interact directly. By definition, her-
maphrodites produce both small, more numerous gametes
(sperm), and large, less numerous gametes (ova). If we then
assume that ova, in general, are limiting while sperm are abun-
dant, it follows that a hermaphrodite might prefer to donate
sperm to a particular mating partner, while not necessarily
wanting to receive sperm from that same partner [5]. Such pre-
ference for the male role can explain why the marine flatworm
Macrostomum lignano appears to remove sperm by sucking their
female genital pore after mating [11]. While M. lignano only
lays one or two eggs per day, they mate, on average, 24 times
in 4h [11]. Such a high mating rate is clearly not necessary to
fertilize the small number of eggs, so their main goal appears
