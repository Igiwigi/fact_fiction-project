The determination of the carbon monoxide content by burning this gas, with a
measured excess of oxygen (in the combustion pipette), removing the carbon dioxide
by absorption, and measuring the volume of oxygen unused, was found to be unreliable
because of the impossibility of preventing traces of tap-grease from reaching the

platinum spiral. The determination of the carbon monoxide content—by removing it
with a liquid absorbent—was not possible because absorbents for carbon monoxide
also absorb oxygen. Attempts were made to remove oxygen by acid solutions of (a) chromous salts,
(6) vanadous salts, but these absorbents were useless owing to the fact that they
decompose slowly with the evolution of hydrogen. Acid solutions of titanous chloride
were found to be unsatisfactory because of their slowness in action. A satisfactory liquid absorbent for oxygen was finally obtained by substituting
trisodium phosphate (Na,PO,) for caustic soda in the normal oxygen absorbent.
