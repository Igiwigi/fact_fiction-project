Similarly, the peaks at 20 =44.2째 and 51.6째 for the Co/SiO2 sample are characteristic of metallic
cobalt, indicating that cobalt oxide was completely reduced [24,51]. Remarkably, the peaks of the
monometallics do not appear in the XRD pattern of the Pt-Co/SiO2 catalyst, but rather two new
peaks are observed at around 40.7째 and 47.2째, which are characteristic of an ordered, intermetallic
Pt3Co phase [49,52,53].

It must be noted that all the diffraction peaks of the bimetallic system, Pt-Co/SiOg, are shifted
slightly to the right (higher 26 values) relative to the position of the Pt/SiO2 monometallic sample
[54]. This peak shift is an indication of the Co incorporation into the Pt fcc structure, which causes
a decrease in the lattice constant of Pt-Co alloy (2.19 A) compared with the pure Pt (2.25 A).
Therefore, the substitution of Co into Pt lattice leads to the contraction of the unit cell [9,53,54]. It
is interesting to see that there are no peaks of Co in the Pt-Co/SiOz XRD patterns, which can be
attributed to the fact that most of the Co is located in the proximity of Pt, forming the alloy.
Additionally, it is probable that Co might be present in the amorphous form and thus is not
detected. These postulates are in agreement with the study done by Dohade ef al. [52] related
to the Pt-Co alloy formation.

The Pt and Co loadings in the samples were verified by the AAS analysis (see electronic
supplementary material, table S1). It was found that the experimental values are very close to the
nominal weight percentages that were determined in the whole samples. This is because Pt and
Co have fully reduced after the pretreatment conditions due to a lower metal-support interaction.
Figure 3 shows the H7 Temperature-Programmed Reaction (TPR) profiles of 2Co/SiO2, 2Pt/SiOz
and 2Pt-2Co/SiO2 samples.

The TPR profile of the 2Co/SiO2 sample shows evidence of two sequential reduction steps
