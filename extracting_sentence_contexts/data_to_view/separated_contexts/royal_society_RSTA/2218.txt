For them ‘dynamical’ connoted systems that could be analysed as matter in motion
in a continuous medium using Lagrangian methods with energy as the foundational concept. By
the 1860s and 70s energy was replacing force as the fundamental, conserved, basis of physics. In


1870 Clifford considered that for the majority of scientists, ‘Force is regarded as the great fact that
lies at the bottom of all things’, but that this view was being superseded [38, p. 121]. A few years
later Tait opined that, ‘in another century [force] will probably have lost all but a mere antiquarian
interest.’ [39, p. xiv]. As a major proponent of the new energy programme in physics, Tait further claimed that
‘[energy] has been shown to have as much claim to objective reality as matter has’, because it was
conserved [39, p. 4].
