& We are now brought to the final consideration of a very interesting question we
3 Braised on p. 206, viz., the possibility of the pressure effect being in part due to
ยง excitation at the point of the brain chiefly pressed upon. From the facts which we

have related on p. 209, there was no reason to believe that such an excitatory effect
Q existed. But we now wish to mention a direct experiment which we made in connexion
with this subject, and that of mass displacement. The experiment consisted of
division of the mesencephalon, after which it was found that pressure was just as
active as before in calling forth the changes in the circulation and respiration.

The effects observed are consequently not due to any local excitation at the point
chiefly compressed.
