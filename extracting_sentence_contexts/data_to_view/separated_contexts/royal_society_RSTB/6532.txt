However, the presence of this complication does not seem to invalidate
the general conclusions. Several striking points emerge from this series of experiments. With one significant
exception, namely the 4 day old females, all the ovipositing parasites showed the
differential reaction towards hosts containing various instars of the parasite, and
this type of response can therefore be regarded as an established fact. The ovi-
position of the 4 day old females, however, indicates that this behaviour may be
dependent upon the condition of the ovary, and the factors normally responsible for
the exercise of restraint were so completely suppressed that hosts were oviposited in
without any apparent reference to the nature of the parasite stage within them; hosts
parasitized with Ovencyrtus eggs or early larvae at the commencement of the experiment
were attacked to an equal or even greater extent than the unparasitized control. Surprisingly, when the inhibition of oviposition was extended beyond the first four
days of life, restraint again became evident so that the females which had been kept
ten days before being given hosts showed greater restraint that the younger females.
