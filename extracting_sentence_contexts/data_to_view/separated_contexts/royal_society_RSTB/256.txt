57 (which will be explained later), and is
from the posterior end. 5

Barrots (3) denies altogether the existence of any forward prolongation of
ccelom into this region of the body; but, since it seldom exists till a few hours be!
fixation, and is much obscured afterwards, this is not very surprising. Far
suprising is the fact that the anterior body-cavity and its pore seem also to ha:
escaped his notice. GorrÂ®, on the other hand, figures an enormously wide prolongation, into which
tapering cord of splanchnic mesoderm runs from the mesenteron. He gives
explanation of how this state of affairs arose, and I have no doubt that he has
confused together the anterior body-cavity and the forward prolongation of the righ
body-cavity.
