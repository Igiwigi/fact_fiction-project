The distances from the wound of the morphological centres of I,a and Ik, when
they were leaves, show that the centres of new leaves can only be determined in positions
that allow room for their stipules. They also indicate that in the Lupin the minimum
area in which a leaf can be determined subtends approximately 124Â°, or perhaps slightly
more. The relevant facts are recorded and discussed in sections 6, 11, 13 and 20, and
summarized in Part 5.

5. In six experiments I,a and I,k both developed as leaves: they were then always
united above the wound. 6.
