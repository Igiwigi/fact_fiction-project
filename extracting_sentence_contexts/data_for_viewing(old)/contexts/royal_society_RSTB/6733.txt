papers (Young 1936a, b). The interest of this remarkable structure is that in the adult
it consists not of a chiasma or crossing of two distinct fibres, but of a true protoplasmic
bridge, joining the whole substances of the two axons (figs. 5-8 and figs. 28-36,
Plates 43-45). The implication of this arrangement is that the two axons are united
into a continuous protoplasmic mass with a continuous surface, contrary to the strict
interpretation of the neuron theory. From what we know of the mechanism of nervous
conduction it is to be expected that impulses set up on one side of such a bridge will
be conducted across to the other side as regularly as from one part of a nerve fibre to
another. Such an arrangement is so strange that it requires careful description,
especially since Williams, in his very brief account, refers to the crossing of these two
fibres in a chiasma. However, his figure (16 D) shows clearly that what he took to
be the chiasma does not lie in the middle line. Probably it was really the synapse
between first- and second-order giant fibres in the stellate ganglion, in fact the
structure shown in fig. 37, Plate 45.

Fortunately the axons are so large that in addition to the usual neurological methods,
others less disruptive of the cytoplasm can be employed, and the arrangement of the
axons demonstrated with great clarity. The clearest preparations can be obtained from
material fixed in saturated picric acid or in picro-formol, sectioned in celloidin and
stained with Ehrlich’s haematoxylin and eosin, or by Mallory’s or Masson’s methods.

In such preparations the bridge between the two axons can be seen to consist of a
homogeneous substance, having no divisions or membranes across it, and perfectly
continuous with the axoplasm of the two main axons. The presence of membranes
