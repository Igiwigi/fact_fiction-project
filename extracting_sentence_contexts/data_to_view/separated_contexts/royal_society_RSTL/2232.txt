- It
dissolved likewise in muriatic acid. The solution was green-
coloured, sweet tasted, and precisely similar to common
muriate of chromium. '

These facts seemed to show decisively, that this supposed
brown oxide does not combine with acids ; and that when
treated either with acids or alkalies, it is resolved into com-
mon green oxide and chromic acid. To determine the quantity of chromic acid in brown oxide
of chromium, the following experiments were made : 681
grains of brown oxide, previously exposed to an incipient red
heat, were put into a green glass tube, through which a
current of dry hydrogen gas was made to pass, while the
oxide was kept at a red heat by means of a spirit lamp. No
combustion took place ; but a little water was formed, and


188 Dr. TromsoN on some of

the oxide assumed a fine green colour.
