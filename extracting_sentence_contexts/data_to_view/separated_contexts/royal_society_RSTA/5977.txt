We apply a point
source on the lateral interface (shown by a double arrow in figure 7a), characterized by a
frequency f =79.814 Hz (corresponding to 6 = 12.69 m~!), which is inside the mutual stop-
band of the topological and trivial regions. By plotting the displacement field in figure 7a,
we observe a wave that is localized at the interface, with little leakage into the surrounding
medium. The robustness of the system is evidenced by the fact that wave propagation is
not affected by the presence of geometrical defects, represented in this case by a corner in
the interface. In figure 7b, we show the displacement field when the frequency parameter of the point source
is 8 =12.63m7!, which is in the stop-band for the topological array, but in the pass-band for the
trivial one. We observe transmission into the latter section of the system, which highlights that
the operating range for the interfacial modes is restricted to the overlapping band-gap for the
constituent parts of the system.
