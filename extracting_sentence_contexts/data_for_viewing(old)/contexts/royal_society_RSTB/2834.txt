The materials for the general discussion are the facts as to form and structure of
this sporophyte generation in living plants, together with those relating to fossil
forms. It is easy to arrange these in apparent series, illustrating possible progressions
from the simpler to the more complex, or conversely, possible retrogressions from the
more complex to the simpler. But it is on broad lines of comparison and probability,
checked by such knowledge of stratigraphical sequence of the fossils as can be
obtained, that opinion must be based as to the true validity of such series as real
exponents of any evolution in the past; it is only thus that it can be decided whether
any particular series has actually been progressive or retrogressive.

I desire to repeat here with all emphasis, that the present is no mere attempt to
trace homologies, or to define the actual relationships of the families of Archegoniatze,
though the new facts acquired will undoubtedly have their bearings on such questions.
The first and main object has been to obtain a knowledge of the methods of
morphological change: that is, to elicit the steps by which modification of internal
structure and external form of the sporophyte actually has taken place. In such a
study ample allowance is to be made for parallel developments in lines of descent
which show no near relationship. In this connection I repeat with emphasis the view
that, â€œit is even an open question whether the rudimentary sporophyte of certain
Alge be truly comparable with that of the Bryophyta; but in any case it

* Excepting the Hydropteridew, these plants haye been so thoroughly investigated by others, that a
special revision of their sporangial details seemed unnecessary.
