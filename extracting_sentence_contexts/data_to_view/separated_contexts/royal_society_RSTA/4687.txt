In order to obtain the true value
of s) it will, perhaps, be advisable to take the mean of the two values given by the
above equations, for, although Jouy considered his second set of experiments the
more reliable, the first set applied more particularly to the lower pressures. Thus we obtain for s) the value 0°16538 cal. per gr. degree at 55° C. Correcting
this value for the fact that Jony used the value 536°7 cal./gr. for the latent heat of
steam, we obtain s) = 0°16645, on the assumption that L = 540°2 cal./gr. This value

is expressed in terms of the calorie at 20°C.
