48 PROFESSOR A. R. FORSYTH ON THE INTEGRATION OF

In the first section (§ 2), a generalisation of Ampére’s method was dealt with very
briefly, partly because that method and Darsovux’s method apply most effectively
to equations in which (with few exceptions) the derivatives of the highest order
occur linearly ; and, of the two, it is DarBoux’s method which can be more effectively
applied to other equations. The fact that the characteristic invariant was resoluble
proved of material importance in the general theory.

It is to be remarked, however, that some of the equations which occur most
frequently in mathematical physics, for example

Ov Ov Cv =

aa + ae + 38 = %
Ov ; Ov Ov = Ov
Or Op Ov 5 Ov
aa Ta ce es
