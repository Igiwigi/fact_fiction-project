of a stria towards the hollow surface of the next may well be supposed by its
inductive action to drive from the next stria a similar pulse, which in its turn drives
one from the next stria, and 80 on. Thus the processes in the naturally and artificially
striated columns are precisely similar, s8ave that in the case of the latter the
pulses from the several strize are excited by induction from without the tube,
while in the case of the former the induction is that of the discharge itself in its
passage from stria to stria, The passage of the discharge is due in both cages to an
action consisting of an independent discharge from one stria to the next ; and the
idea of this action can perhaps be best illustrated by that of a line of boys crossing a
brook on stepping stones, each boy stepping on to the stone which the boy in front of
him has left.

The truth of the foregoing theory is confirmed by the fact that it is not only by
means of the positive special effect that we obtain formations analogous to srize, but
we can also obtain them by means of the other special and relief-effects when the
electrical actions are of such a kind as would lead us to expect them according to
the theory here pub forward. Take, for example, the positive relief-effecb. When
the pulses passing through the tube are positive and a finger is placed on the tube,
the positive relief-effect 80 caused consists, under certain relations of quantity and
tension in the discharge (and notably when the discharge is due to the action of a
8mall coil, as described on page 210, the negative terminal of the tube being put to
earth), of a faint haze beneath the finger, and a large dark space extending right across
the tube, and stretching for ome distance from the spot on which the finger rests
along the tube towards the positive end (Plate 18, fig. 16).* The termination of the
positive luminous column at the place where it abuts on this dark space, is bright
