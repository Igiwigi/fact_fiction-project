intersections.

None of the curves meet the axis of Â© within the limits of the figure.

The curve n=3 meets the axis of y when y=2150, and that for n=3Z when y=1200,
but for values of n smaller than 3 the intersections with the axis of y do not fall within

the figure. The thickness, which it is necessary to give to the lines in drawing,
obviously prevents the possibility of showing these facts, except in a figure of very
large size.

On the side remote from the origin of the curve marked 0, 1 is negative, on the
nearer side positive.

Since M=50,

N,=20/x? and N,=20/y?

Hence the lines on the figure, for which N, is constant, are parallel to the axis of y,
and those for which N, is constant are parallel to the axis of o.
