If. as above, U is a quartic function (*#Lz, y, 2), and U,=4(a,0,+y,0,+2,d.)U, then
U, is a cubic function, and we have
(Ars Bis Gio Fiz 12 Hi On O,z DH =6*=28,. U,,

where it is to be noticed that S, denotes a quartic function in the coefficients of U,, and
consequently a quartic function in (z,, 9, 21), the coefficients being quartic functions of
the coefficients of U. On writing (@, y, 2) in the place of (z,, y1, 2;), S, becomes a quartic
function of (a, y, 2), which is in fact a quarticovariant quartic of U. If in the foregoing equation we write (w, y, 2) in the place of (ï¬†;, yi, 2,), then U,
becomes equal to 2U ; and consequently, if U=0, the right-hand side of the equation
vanishes. Moreover (a, 6,, G,, fi, 9: ky) (the 8econd differential coefficients of U,) become
equal to (a, b, &, f, 9, k), and consequently the coefficients (A,, B,, C,, F,, 6, H,) become
equal to (A, B, C, F, 6, H).
