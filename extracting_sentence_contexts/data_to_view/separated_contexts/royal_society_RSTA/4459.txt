Although we cannot draw any firm conclusions from our limited simulations, one could
hypothesize that the production of proteins crucial to cell function could be prioritized over that of
others using this mechanism. This would be consistent with the correlation between slow codon
arrangement and protein function reported in [14], as well as other recent studies which show
that many mRNA sequences have slow codons positioned close to the initiation site [38,39]. When considering a codon species whose tRNA delivers an amino acid which is not subject
to starvation, we find that the charging level of this species can in fact increase in response
to starvation. This agrees with previous studies which suggest that tRNA charging levels
depend on the balance between their supply and demand [20,3740], and the phenomenon
has also been observed experimentally [3]. Reduced protein production from some mRNAs
can free up resources, which can then be used by other mRNAs leading to increased
protein production.
