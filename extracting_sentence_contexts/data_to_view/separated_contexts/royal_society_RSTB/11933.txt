These findings suggest that similar
cross-modal connections are present in all, synaesthete and
non-synaesthete alike. Our results also raise the question of what is the nature of
the representations at the interface between imagery, synae-
sethesia and perception. Clearly, there are important
phenomenological differences between synaesthesia and ima-
gery, as well as the fact that imagery is more widely

experienced. Previous studies suggest that any differences
found between perception, imagery and synaesthesia may
reflect different stages of information processing along the
sensory pathways. For example, Arnold et al. [70] reported
that the variability in responses to synaesthetic colour match-
ing was similar to colour matching from memory, but larger
than to real colour matching, suggesting that synaesthetic col-
ours are akin to colour memory than perception and that
synaesthetic colours likely arise at a higher level of analysis
in the brain [71].
