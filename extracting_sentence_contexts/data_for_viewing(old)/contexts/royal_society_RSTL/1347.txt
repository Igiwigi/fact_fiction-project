owing to water in actual combination with it, like that in mu-
riatic acid gas, and which may be essential to its elastic state ;
but it is more probable, from the smallness of the quantity,
and from the difference of the quantity in different cases,
that the moisture is merely in that state of diffusion or solu-
tion in which it exists in gases in general, though from the
disposition of water to be deposited in this acid gas in the. .
form of an acid solution, it must be: either less in quantity, or
in a less free state, 80 as to require for its exhibition much
more delicate hygrometrical tests.

The facts advanced in this Lecture, afford no new argu-
ments in favour of an idea to which I referred in my last
communication to the Society, that of hydrogene being a
common principle in all inflammable bodies ; and except in
instances which are still under investigation, and concerning
which no precise conclusions can as yet be drawn, the gene-
ralization of Lavorster happily applies to the explanation of
all the new phenomena.

In proportion as progress is made towards the knowledge
of pure combustible bases, s0 in proportion is the number of
metallic substances increased ; and it is probable that sulphur
and phosphorus, could they be perfectly deprived of oxygene,
