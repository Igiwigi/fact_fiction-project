Axial ornament consisting of numerous, sharp, closely spaced riblets which are of the
same width as, or slightly narrower than, their intervals, and are noticeably retrocurrent;
there are five in ? mm. on the penultimate whorl. Body whorl with slightly to gently convex flanks, a gently excavated base, and a
moderately long and straight neck. The absence of any trace of a siphonal fasciole may be
due to the fact that the later whorls are missing. Indications of about ten spiral threads on
the neck. Aperture oval and, possibly due to breakage, apparently with a slightly oblique
anterior canal of about the same length as the height of the aperture.
