5. EvIDENCE OF ATTRIBUTION OF LEPTOSTROBUS TO CZEKANOWSKIA

The evidence of attribution is:

(1) association, repeated for several localities and different species of different ages,
(2) agreement in structure.

General position

It is curious that Heer never discussed the possibility that Leptostrobus might belong to
‘zekanowskia; he decided that Leptostrobus was a Voltzia-like conifer while Czekanowskia was
the foliage ofa Ginkgo ally, and this being so they could have nothing to do with one another.
The fact that Leptostrobus bears little leaves at its base, looking very like the foliage leaves
of many conifers, was part of Heer’s evidence. These scale leaves might, however, have been
taken as evidence that Leptostrobus does not belong to a plant with shoots bearing such
scale-like leaves, since no such conifer occurs with them.

In a later paper he regarded some narrow pine-like leaves as the foliage of Leptostrobus,
and in view of their resemblance to Solenites he may well have been right. Later authors
endorsed Heer’s view that Leptostrobus is allied to Voltzia, and as far as I know the first
expression of another view was my opinion (1935) that it belonged to Czekanowskia.
Czekanowskia and Leptostrobus are associated on many of Heer’s figured blocks, but he selected
some other fossils as fructifications.
