All he has said
reduces itself to a repetition of the. common adage © dry as
a mummy.” Like Dr. HapLey, BLuMExBacn, and many
subsequent writers, he came to the conclusion, that Egyptian
mummies are invariably found in a state of aridity, without
the least vestige of the soft parts or viscera, and are wholly
deprived: of humidity, in fact, that they are mere- skele-
tons enveloped in © cerecloth:”” It will be seen,-that such an
opinion requires considerable modification. The next information -of -importance we possess on the
subject of Egyptian mummies, is to be found inthe third
and fourth volume of the Transactions of the Royal Society
of Gottingen.
