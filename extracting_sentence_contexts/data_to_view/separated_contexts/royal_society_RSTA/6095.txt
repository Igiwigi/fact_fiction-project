By
poking the cylinder at different axial loads they were able to identify a ‘stability landscape’
which captures the stability of a system, with the transition from a positive force on the poker
to a negative force at buckling. It was then shown by Abramian ef al. [15] that by performing
a ‘ridge tracking’ procedure on these landscapes, one can estimate the buckling load of a
cylindrical shell with an introduced defect to within 5% error. Hutchinson & Thompson [16]
suggested that the work done by the poker is in fact the energy barrier to buckling through
lateral deformation; a zero ridge height coincides with a zero energy barrier to buckling, thus,
the ridge tracking method estimates the axial load where spontaneous buckling is initiated. The
stability landscape has recently been used by Royer & Pellegrino [17] to look at optimal design
for space-deployable structures and study the early transition into the post-buckled regime. A
similar approach was also recently explored by Marthelot et al. [18] and Abbasi ef al. [19] to
accurately predict the buckling of hemispherical shells.
