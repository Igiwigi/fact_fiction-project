and Decenber 1971 to Dr Lush), we asked all the interested directors of IC
establishments to let us have their views, and the MRC's answer was given in
Dr Nesle's letter of 22nd June to Mr Jolliffe. The second paragraph of that
letter sets out the position at that time in relation to the teams at King's
‘and ot tne Laboratory of Molecular Biology.

We have now discussed the matter again with Professor Wilkine and with

Dr Perutz and they do not feel that the new proposals in any vay run contrary
to their oarlier views. Profcosor Wilkins regards his contribution to the
Joint programe as a departmental activity end the MRC vill therefore be
involved only if he decides to submit grant applications to ue for support of
thie works T understand thet he is, in fact, intending insteed to approach the
SRC. Dr Perutz is still emphatic that Arndt's use of the facility ie in a
conzultant capacity (in relation to the Daresbury Latoretory) and that no
charge should be levied. It may well be that Professor Wilkins may also wish
to take up this stance.
