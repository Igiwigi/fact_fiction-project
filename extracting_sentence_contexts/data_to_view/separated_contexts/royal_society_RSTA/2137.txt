Let X be a finite connected undirected (q + 1)-regular graph. Then

where x(X) is the Euler characteristic of X and A = A(X) is the adjacency operator. Since x(X) < 0, Z(X; 1) is in fact the reciprocal of a polynomial in 1. Similar to the Riemann zeta
function, Z(X;u) is said to satisfy the Riemann hypothesis if its non-trivial poles, namely, those
arising from the non-trivial eigenvalues of X in det(I — Au + qu7J), all have the same absolute
value q~1/?. Hence one obtains another criterion for Ramanujan graphs in terms of zeta functions,
namely X is a Ramanujan graph if and only if Z(X, u) satisfies the Riemann hypothesis.
