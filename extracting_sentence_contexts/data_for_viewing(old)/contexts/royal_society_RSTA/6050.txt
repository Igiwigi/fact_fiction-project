Nz (termed first and second normal stress differences, respectively). These generate a force in
the direction of the streamline curvature for curvilinear flows, leading to well-known elastic
phenomena such as the Weissenberg effect (rod climbing) [22]. Such phenomena combined with
the richness of TC flow and the complexity and structural properties of viscoelastic fluids give
rise to a wealth of new flow states and instabilities leading to elastic or elasto-inertial turbulence
(EIT) [23,24].

In contrast to ET, which appears only in curvilinear flows due to hoop stresses (excluding
the numerical works of [25]), EIT also appears in unperturbed straight flows (e.g. pipe/channel
and jet flows) [26-29]. The onset and structure of EIT in pipes/straight channels have been
studied extensively, both experimentally and numerically, since its first observation by [27]
revealing coherent structures like near-wall extensional streaks/chevron-type patterns [26,30]
or arrowhead regimes [31,32]. The motivation for some of these studies is the fact that adding
polymers to a pipe flow has been long known to reduce drag [33]; this is a polymer concentration-
dependent phenomenon reaching a universal asymptote so-called maximum drag reduction
(MDR). It was not until later that polymer drag reduction and MDR were attributed to the
onset of EIT [20,21,26,27,30,34]. The latter coincides with a weakening of vortices aligned in the
streamwise direction (which are effective at transmitting momentum between the freestream
and the boundary layer) and a growing dominance of vortices aligned perpendicular to the
flow [21].

In TC flows, ET and EIT have not been fully characterized experimentally to allow qualitative
and quantitative comparisons of mechanisms and structures with pipe/channel flows. Samanta
et al. [27] found that the onset of EIT in the pipe flow was independent of the perturbation applied,
suggesting that it was associated with a supercritical transition (supported by later numerical and
