This would result, if the change
were in the direction of increase, in the earliest and hence smallest parents being
taken with the earliest and hence smallest offspring, the next smallest parents with
the next smallest offspring, and so on, and so a positive correlation between parent
and offspring would be produced. Table XIII shows, however, that the change from
week to week was not regularly progressive. Besides, it is possible to establish the
fact that the larger parents really do have larger offspring by a method which
practically excludes the influence of changing environment. For this purpose
the mean antennar length and frontal breadth were found for all the parents
preserved on the same day for each of the 22 days of the experiment on which
parents were preserved. All the parents below the mean for their day were placed
on one side (small parents).and all the parents above the mean on the other side (large
parents).
