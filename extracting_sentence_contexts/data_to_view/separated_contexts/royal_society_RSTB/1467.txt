Again, as the arm
engths are all percentages on the body lengths, and as the body lengths tend to
with increase of temperature, it might be possible that the arm lengths,
lot being affected by the temperature to the same degree, should apparently increase

length on rise of temperature. The fact that the larve developed at 20° to 22°,
thich have considerably greater arm lengths than those developed at 18° to 20°,
ve also a slightly greater body length, proves that this is not the case. This
fact proves that the relative maturity of the ova and spermatozoa can account
t in small part for this increased arm length at higher temperatures. Thus, the
body length may be taken as an approximate index of the maturity, and, though
