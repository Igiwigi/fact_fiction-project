The
reason for the narrowing of the deposits as they approach the centre of the plate would
appear to be due to the greater velocity of the currents where they meet over the
centre of the plates caused by the union of all the currents from the different sides.

The importance of the dustless film from the under side of the plate is evidenced by
the fact observed by Dr. Russetn that no figure is obtained unless the plate be
supported above the bottom of the receiver. When we examine by means of the
beam of light the surface of a plate laid on the bottom of the receiver, we still find
the dust-free film of air over the plate when the plate is pretty hot.
