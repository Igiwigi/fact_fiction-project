hoped, successful, it is understood that one of the principal uses to which it will be
devoted will be the examination and exact delineation of the numerous and wonderful
objects of this class which the southern hemisphere presents.

These circumstances, but more especially the last-mentioned, render it extremely
desirable to haye presented in one work, without the necessity of turning over many
volumes, a general catalogue of all the nebule and clusters of stars actually known, both
northern and southern, arranged in order of right ascension and reduced to a common
and sufficiently adyanced epoch which may serye as a general index to them, and enable
an obseryer at once to turn his instrument on any one of them, as well as to put it in
his power immediately to ascertain whether any object of this nature which he may
encounter in his obseryations is new, or should be set down as one previously observed.
For want of such a general catalogue, in fact, a great many nebulz haye been, from
time to time, in the *Astronomische Nachrichten‚Äù and elsewhere, introduced to the world
as new discoyerics, which haye since been identified with nebulz already described and
well known. Many a supposed comet, too, would have been recognized at once as a
nebula, had such a general catalogue been at hand, and much yaluable time been thus
8ayed to their observers in looking out for them again.

Besides these there are other considerations which have weighed with me in under-
taking the task of compiling such a general catalogue, Having, in the course of my
own observyations, received the greatest possble assistance from the possession of a Manu-
script Catalogue of all the nebulz and clusters discovered by my Father, brought to the
common epoch 1800-0, and arranged in zones of 1* in breadth in polar distance, by his
sister the late Miss CAROLINA L. HursCnEL, it seemed to me nothing less than a debt of
