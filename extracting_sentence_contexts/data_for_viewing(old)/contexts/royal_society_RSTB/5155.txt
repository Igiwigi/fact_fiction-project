opening situated in front of and slightly to the right of ocular III. Genital 1 lies to the
right of, and is partly concealed by, the madreporite. It is larger than in the less
advanced imagines, but is still very openly reticulate. Genitals 3 and 4 have not yet
appeared. MacBrrpr (1918) has found that the adult anus is already open in the imago
and is situated in the centre of the dorsal surface. The mouth, which is still covered
by the epineural veil, is in the centre of the peristome.

In many respects the imago resembles a regular urchin rather than a Spatangoid. In
shape it is almost spherical: the ambulacra are all similar (see fig. 2), apetaloid, and
already possess a number of plates in each column, The primary (terminal) tube-foot
is already a mere nodule, and can only be made out in sections. The inter-ambulacra,
too, are primitive and resemble those of a regular urchin in the arrangement of the
plates, and in the fact that each bears a well-developed spine (which has been termed a
primary spine, and probably corresponds to the primary spine in a regular urchin).
The position of the mouth in the circular peristome, and of the anus in the dorsal surface,
add to the resemblance.

But this resemblance is superficial, for already the bilateral symmetry of the adult is
apparent (compare figs. 2 and 5). â€˜The peristome, though circular, is situated somewhat
nearer the anterior than the posterior end of the body. Inter-ambulacra 1, 5 and 4
are more developed than the two anterior ones, while the three anterior ambulacra
(IL, If and IV) are smaller (i.e., possess fewer plates) than the two posterior ones. The
