FREEZING AND MELTING POINTS OF ALLOYS OF SILVER AND COPPER. 73

temperature were not analysed separately. But where the solidus specimens of any
one ingot had received different preliminary heat treatments, greater care was necessary,
and each specimen was analysed.

The temperature of the peritectic or eutectic horizontal was determined as lying
between 606° and 625°, by quenching alloys in the two-phase area. It will be seen
that the system is remarkable for the relatively steep fall in the solidus as compared
with the corresponding lines in the systems silver-indium, silver-aluminium, and copper-
gallium. Reference to the collected tables will show that the solidus depression is, in
fact, almost exactly equal to that of the normal 4-valent system silver-tin.

The Solubility Curve.

Table XXXIV gives the results of the experiments for the determination of the
solubility curve, and is self-explanatory except for the following points: Alloy 18-86.
