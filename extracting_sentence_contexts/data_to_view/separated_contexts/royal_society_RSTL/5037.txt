If the blue colour had previously been destroyed by an acid, it was restored
Sy the alkali. If the horse-chestnut had never been examined chemically, these
Sbservations alone would indicate that in all probability the principle to which the
Slue colour was due was capable of entering into firm combination with acids, but
Aid not combine with alkalies. It is, in fact, as we know, a vegetable base.
= 213. A solution of nitrate of uranium in ether is insensible, as if some of the
Flements of the ether entered into firm combination with the oxide of uranium. In
Fonnexion with this circumstance, it is rather remarkable, that although the ether

Fbas all the appearance of oxalate of uranium.
