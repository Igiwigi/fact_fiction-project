C. G. BARKLA ON X-RAYS AND THE THEORY OF RADIATION.

is the atomic weight and e the electronic charge. (This nucleus, together with the
number of electrons found from the scattering of X-rays, constitutes a neutral atom.)

Bonr* on certain assumptions has shown that such an atom is capable of forming
the basis of an explanation of the line spectra of hydrogen and helium, agreeing in a
most remarkable way with experimental fact. Mosetey,t too, has given further evidence in support of the conclusion as to the
number of electrons per atom. His “atomic numbers” are identical with the values
given above.
