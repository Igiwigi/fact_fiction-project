VOLTAIC EXCITEMENT AFFECTED BY DILUTION. 109

gradual diminution of effect from iron to copper, and from copper to silver, one would
not expect the reverse effects, or those on the other side of zero, to appear by a return
back to 8uch metals as lead and tin (1979. 1989.), but rather Jook for them in platinum
or gold, which, however, produce no results of the kind (1976. 1988.). To increase
$till further this complexity, it appears, from what has been before stated, that on
changing the acids the order must again be changed (1981.). Nay, more, that with
the same acid, and merely by changing the proportion of dilution, such alteration
of the order mnst take place (1986. 1988.).

1992. Thus it appears, as before remarked (1982.), that to apply the theory of con-
tact electromotive force to the facts, that theory must twist and bend about with
every variation of chemical action : and after all, with every variety of contact, active
and inactive, in no case presents phenomena independent of the active exertion of
chemical force.

1993. As the influence of dilution and concentration was 80 strong in affecting the
relation of different parts of the same metal to an acid, making 'one part either
positive or negative to another, T thought it probable that, by mere variation in the
strength of the interposed electrolyte, the order of metals when in acids: or other
solations of uniform strength, might be changed. I therefore proceeded to experi-
ment on that point, by combining together two metals, tin and lead, through the gal-
vanometer (1915.); arranging the electrolytic solution in tube No. 1, strong on one
side and weak on the other; immersing the wires simultaneously, tin into the strong,
