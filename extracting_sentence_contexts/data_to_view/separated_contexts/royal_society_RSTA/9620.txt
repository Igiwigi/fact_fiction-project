If the original and emergent origins are conjugate points, h = 0. We shall now consider the case of refraction of a general ray at a symmetrical
surface centred upon the a-axis and shall show that a scheme {g+dg, ...} may be
derived for it, which shall include the aberrations; these, represented by the
additional terms dg, ..., will, of course, vary from point to point with the squares and
products of the co-ordinates and angles of incidence upon the surface, whereas for the
pure linear scheme g, ... are the same for every ray of the beam. Taking rectangular axes Oayz, let the equation of the surface separating the-region
of index » fiom that of index x’ be

2a = Bi +2)+4C(yt+7yP. . . . ...=. . (5)

Let a ray

y = Bx+b, z= yxte,
in the original medium be transformed by refraction at the surface into
y = Ba’ +0, 2 =y2'+e',
where the axes are, in fact, the same but are accented to indicate the difference of
medium. The positive direction of the x-axis is that in which the light is travelling. MR.
