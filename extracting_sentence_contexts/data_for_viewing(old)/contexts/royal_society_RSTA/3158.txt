pluralism (the pitchfork bifurcation of fixed points occurs at p = 0.2). There is consensus for p < p;, and pluralism otherwise.

(ii) Two populations of zealots

We now suppose that each opinion has an equal number of zealots, p = q (the problem with p 4 q
is considered in [29]). This is also what will be assumed when we consider a two-city model in §4.
For p > 0, the continuation of the fixed point G, 4) is

1-2p —*)
bo) = | ———, ——— }.
(a0, bo) ( 3073

This follows from the fact that the fixed point equations (2.3) collapse to
m=a ~ 1-—2a—-2p=a ~ a=}(1—2p).

Clearly, the fixed point is only physical for 0<p< } The limit p=q= 3 corresponds to each
opinion having only zealots. Regarding the stability of this fixed point, we have the following
proposition.

Proposition 2.3. The fixed point (ag, bo) is a saddle point for 0 <p < i, and a stable node for 3 <ps }
There is a bifurcation of critical points at p = i.

Proof. The linearization of the vector field at the fixed point is
Az 1 —(1 + 4p) p-2
~3\ p-2  —-(1+4p)}’
