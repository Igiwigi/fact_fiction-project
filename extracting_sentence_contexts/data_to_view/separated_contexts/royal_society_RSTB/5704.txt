Firstly, the results
reported in Section (5) of Part 2, especially the results of the second group of isolations
of I,, show that the positions in which primordia arise depend on the positions of the
outlines of the previous primordia, and not on any hypothetical circles of inhibiting
influence spreading out from the centres of those primordia, such as ScHOUTE assumes. Secondly, Scuoure’s assumption that the central point of a primordium is always
determined first, independently of the rest of the primordium, is inconsistent with the

fact that, in the Lupin at least, the centres of primordia do not arise in positions which
would not allow room for their stipules on each side. Moreover, ScHouTr’s assumptions,
apart from being inconsistent with the facts, are in any case unnecessary. With regard to the above working hypothesis, it must be pointed out that the
necessary minimum width and minimum distance from the growing-point must both be
relative to the size of the stem apex.
