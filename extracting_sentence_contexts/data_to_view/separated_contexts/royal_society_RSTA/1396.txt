(4) Normal pressure varying as cos 0 over the internal circular boundary of an otherwise
infinite plate. As a first example, before embarking upon the general solution, we solve the problem
for a normal pressure varying as cos 0 applied to the boundary. This is of more practical
importance than the fact that the traction is of opposite sign upon the two halves of
the boundary would, at first sight, indicate. In conjunction with the known and
very simple distribution of stress due to a uniform pressure on the boundary, it will
give the stress distribution round a hole into which a rivet has been driven, when the
rivet is pulled sideways (7.e., by a force in the plane of the plate). Moreover, these
terms will be the important ones at a distance from the hole, in any case.
