304 J. NEYMAN AND E. 8. PEARSON ON THE PROBLEM OF

The test obtained by finding the best critical region is in fact the ordinary test for
the significance of a variation in the mean of a sample; but the method of approach
helps to bring out clearly the relation of the two critical regions % = @ and % = %.
Further, it has been established that starting from the same information, the test of
this hypothesis could not be improved by using any other form of criterion or critical
region.

Example (2).—The admissible hypotheses are as before given by (33), but in this
case the means are known to have a given common value a, while c is unspecified.
We may suppose the origin to be taken at the common mean, so that a= ad = 0.
H, is the hypothesis that « =o, and an alternative H, is that c =«,. In this case
it is easy to show that the best critical region with regard to H, is defined by the
inequality,
