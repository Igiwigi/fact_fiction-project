Ir is an opinion now very generally entertained by anatomists that in vertebrate and in
certain invertebrate animals, there are in connexion with the nervous system apolar,
unipolar, and multipolar, including bipolar cells.

It is easy to demonstrate the presence of multipolar cells, but it is another matter
altogether to prove that certain cells which seem to be apolar or unipolar are really
of this nature. An obseryer is justified in asserting very positively the existence of
that which he has himself distinctly seen and has shown to others; but it does not
follow that he is correct in concluding that, because a fibre or other structure has not
been seen by him in certain specimens, it therefore does not exist, for the actual exist-
ence of a structure and its demonstration are two very different questions in minute
anatomical inquiry. The one is a question of fact, no matter how it may be explained,
or how many different interpretations may be offered of it. The other is but an infer-
ence arrived at in the absence of evidence, and may result from imperfect means of
observation, or want of due care on the part of the observer in preparing the specimen.

A new fact, if capable of being demonstrated to others, will be received at once as
true, but negative asertions, although supported by the authority of the most expe-
rienced, ought in matters of obseryation to be received with the greatest caution.

It is one thing to assert that a cell has no fibre proceeding from it, or that a cell has
but one fibre, and another to state that no fibre or but one fibre has been demonstrated.
Although many general facts are opposed to the notion of the presence of apolar and
unipolar cells, the existence of such cells is generally admitted and taught. If apolar
