It will be shown that the rotatory motion may be calculated on the same principles
as rectilinear motion ; but that the oscillatory character of the motion introduces the
consideration of the inertia of the air in motion, which causes the middle portions of
the stratum to lag behind, as is shown in fig. 8, where the curves represent the sncces-
sive positions of a line of particles of air, which, if there were no motion, would be a
straight line perpendicular to the planes. The fact that the moving planes are bounded by a circular edge introduces another
difficulty, depending on the motion of the air near the edge being different from that of
the rest of the air. The lines of equal motion of the air are shown in fig. 9.
