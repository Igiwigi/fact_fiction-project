The outcome of my experiments is that certain individual instruments give readings
which do not vary through a great range of psychrometric conditions, but that,
generally speaking, an atmosphere approaching saturation affects the readings con-
siderably. In practice the fact is of no great importance, since I never make use of
the hygroscope for absolute, but for comparative or relative readings.

Wind.â€”It is important that observations of any accuracy should be made in a
place free from air-currents. In a wind, the air on the surface of the leaf is so rapidly
renewed that the index of the hygroscope cannot react fairly. If the stomata are
