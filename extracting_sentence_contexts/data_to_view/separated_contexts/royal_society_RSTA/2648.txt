These oscillations have very little effect
upon the barometer, the ordinary diurnal barometric variation being a thermal and
not a tidal effect; but a lunar barometric tide does exist, and has been evaluated
with a considerable degree of accuracy at some tropical stations (St. Helena,
Singapore, and Batavia). * The explanation gains weight from the fact that at
perigee the lunar magnetic variations are of distinctly greater amplitude than at
apogee,t and there is some evidence that the ratio of the amplitudes at the two
seasons is that which would be predicted by the tidal theory (1°23), though the
observational results do not suffice, as yet, to establish this definitely. §5. Dr. van BemMeten, at Batavia, has recently collected all the existing
determinations of the lunar magnetic variation for different stations, and has
examined this material, together with newly computed data for other stations, to see
whether the magnetic field which produces these effects has a potential, and whether
the latter has its source above or below the earth’s surface.{
