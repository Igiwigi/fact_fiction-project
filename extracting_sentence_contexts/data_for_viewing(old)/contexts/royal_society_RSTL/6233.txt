As every piece of iron not composing a part of, and hammered in the fabrication of
the hull, —such as the rudder, funnel, boilers and machinery, tanks, cooking galleys,
fastenings of deck houses, &c.,—are all of a magnetic character differing from the hull
of a ship, their proximity should be avoided, and, s0 far as possible, the compass should
be placed 80 that they may act as correctors of the general magnetism of the hull.

A compass placed out of the middle line of the deck is affected by the nearest top-
8ide, and its deviations must necessarily be much increased if that topside has the domi-
nant polarity, as in ships built East or West.

A Experience has proved that the practical value of mast or elevated compasses has in
Bme cases been overrated ; they are, in fact, affected by the ship's magnetisgm to an
Snount depending on their elevation and the direction of the ship's build : thus in ships
Euilt North or South, but especially the latter—the compass being on the mizen mast—
Sie deviations will be large comparatively. In ships built East or West the deviations
Kill be comparatively small, from the topside, which would affect a deck compass, being
Bore directly under the mast-compass ; they may therefore be useful in the latter cases,
Hil valueless in a ship built head to the South. The wear and tear on the pivots and
EM caps of mast-compasses, from the increased motion due to their elevation, require
nstant attention when they are employed.
