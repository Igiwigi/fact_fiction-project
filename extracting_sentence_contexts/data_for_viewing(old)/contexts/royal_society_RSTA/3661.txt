Although it was widely believed that water was a key component of comets, and was likely to
be instrumental in the production of comae, it was not until 1986 that water was actually detected

[2]. At this time, the working hypothesis of what a cometary nucleus would look like was based : =
on the pioneering study by Whipple [3], who made and interpreted ground-based observations of : a
comet Encke. He proposed that the nucleus was an ‘icy conglomerate’ composed of dust particles 3
embedded in ices. The dust itself was assumed to be similar to meteoritic (chondritic) material, : XS
while the ice component was considered to be dominated by water, with other volatiles such : _
as methane and ammonia. It was also envisaged that organics were present. Colloquially, the 4
overall idea became known as the ‘dirty snowball’ of cometary nuclei. In a sense the close-up 72
images of Halley obtained by Giotto [4] confirmed the ‘icy conglomerate’ model but there was a : a
fundamental surprise—the surface was very dark, with an albedo of less than 4% (in fact, history : &

records that this had been predicted just prior to the encounter with Halley; see [5]). The spacecraft
found hardly any evidence for bright patches of ice at the surface of Halley. This seemed to suggest
that water (ice) was perhaps not as prevalent in comets as once thought. As such, the idea that
cometary nuclei were like ‘dirty snowballs’ went a long way out of favour. Indeed, the thinking
switched to ‘icy dirtballs’ instead.

That comets include water as a major constituent is clearly established. But the relationships
between the water found in different comets (to each other), or between comets and other bodies
of the Solar System, require the extra dimension of isotopic measurements to understand the
genealogy. It was thus inevitable that an appropriate measurement from Rosetta was eagerly
anticipated. Ultimately, the result of hydrogen isotope measurements (made by the Rosetta
