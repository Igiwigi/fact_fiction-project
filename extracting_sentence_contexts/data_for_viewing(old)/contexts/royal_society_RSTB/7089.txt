is not so definite, but it appears probable that the extreme regression of their gonads releases
them to migrate farthest from the breeding areas. In the following spring the relative lack
of gonad growth in the first-year birds of many species results in the failure of these birds

to undertake the spring migration. Birds such as the purple sandpiper (Erolia m. maritima
Briinnich) often remain in their winter quarters until the spring of their second year of life
(Bullough 19426).

It is also possible on the theory of the determination of behaviour by the sex hormones
to suggest an explanation for several peculiar facts about the activities of young birds in
their first summer. As in juvenile starlings, it may be a common feature for these young
birds just off the nests to have relatively active gonads, and the secretion of sex hormones
by these gonads may account for the sexual behaviour of juvenile birds which has frequently
been described. Young swallows (Hirundo r. rustica L.) of the first brood may help to feed
the second brood (White 1941; Williamson 1941). Young noddy terns (Anous stolidus L.)
are recorded as collecting and carrying nesting material when only 16 days old (Watson
1908), and Craig (1909) describes how a young ring dove (Streptopelia risoria L.), 21 days
old, incubated its parentsâ€™ egg. It is also stated by Hudson (1892) that young oven birds
(Furnarius rufus Gmelin) sing when still in the nest. Similar, but more intense and varied,
effects were obtained experimentally by Noble & Wurm (1938) when they injected month-
old chicks of the black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax n. hoaetli Gmelin) with testosterone
propionate. The secretion of sex hormones by the active gonads of young birds just off the
