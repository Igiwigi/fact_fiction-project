Herein, we present the second part
of the contributions to this bicentenary celebration of Stokes’ achievements. As we have already
seen in Part 1, and we find once again here, these range over huge areas of physics and beyond. In fact, it was aspects of Stokes’ character beyond his scientific contributions that first caught
the attention of poets. Stokes was deeply interested in attempting to reconcile science and religion,
and nineteenth- and early twentieth-century poets singled out his religiosity for praise—Jebb and
Mason were both Cambridge classicists (boxes 1 and 2). A more recent poem by Michael Berry
highlights his contributions to the theory of asymptotics (box 3).
