rock has probably set up movements in certain parts of the mass, from one of which
this specimen has been derived.

Nos. 9 to 15 are from the Grenville series, of the Laurentian system, of Canada.
The first six are from the counties of Peterborough and Hastings, in the province of
Ontario, in the district to the north of the lake ot that name, and the last is from a
point about 40 miles west of Montreal, in the province of Quebec.

9. Marble. Lot 12, Range V., Township of Burleigh, Ontario.â€”This marble comes
from the same great limestone belt as Nos. 10 and 11, although several miles distant

from the locality from which the latter was obtained. The stratigraphical relations
point to great movements along this line, a fact which is borne out by the structure
of the limestones themselves. The limestone at this locality is coarsely crystalline, in
some cases becoming very coarse, the constituent grains being as much as an inch in
diameter. As in the case of the Carrara deposits, it is for the most part massive and
free from any foliation, but along certain lines or bands it presents a very marked
foliation, and cataclastic structure is distinctly seen in hand specimens, large and
more or less lenticular and much twisted calcite remnants lying with their longer axcs
parallel to one another in a fine-grained base derived from their partial destruction.
Under the microscope the evidence of this action is most striking. The large remnants
are twinned and curved, showing marked strain shadows, and can in many cases be
seen to be in the act of breaking down into smaller grains, especially about their
margins. A microphotograph of the rock is shown in Plate 25, fig. 3. It is taken
between crossed Nicols in polarised light, and is magnified 47 diameters. In the
