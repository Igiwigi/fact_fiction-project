Figure 2b shows that
HF nanoflares produce a very sharp emission peak around Tym, suggesting that this value of Ty
may be too small. On the other hand, a LF nanoflare model gives too broad a distribution with
slope a=2.17. In fact, the values of a found in [39-42] suggests that there are a range of AR properties
some with Ty > Teo and some with the opposite property. The EBTEL approach was used to
investigate many hundreds of possible heating models involving lengthy nanoflare ‘trains’ such
as shown in figure 1 with different nanoflare energy distributions [34]. It was concluded that
only nanoflare trains where (i) the time between each event was proportional to the energy of the
second event and (ii) the nanoflares had a power law distribution were satisfactory.
