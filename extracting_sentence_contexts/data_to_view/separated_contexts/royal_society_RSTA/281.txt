However, severe limitations to this strategy
arise when the signal can change abruptly, rather than smoothly: in fact, this is not a problem for
which classical linear DSP is suited. To illustrate why classical linear filtering is problematic in this situation, consider the
archetypal, step-like signal: the square wave—periodic with instantaneous transitions between two
different amplitudes—which is obscured by serially uncorrelated (white) noise. A fundamental
fact about linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems is the existence of a unique spectral description,
so it is instructive to describe the situation in the Fourier domain. The only Fourier coefficients
of the square wave that are non-zero are odd, integer multiples of the frequency of the wave,
and are proportional to 1/n, where n is the index of the Fourier component. Thus, the Fourier :
series has an infinite number of non-zero terms (infinite bandwidth), and truncating the series 7
introduces spurious oscillations (Gibbs phenomena) near the edges of the square wave, with the is
amplitude of these oscillations increasing as the truncation becomes more drastic.
