On the other hand, there are no septa discoverable in the hyphe ; nor can I detect
anything of the nature of a true spore like the resting-spores typical for the ordinary
Ustilaginese, unless the haustorium-like branches are to be regarded as aborted spores.
The “ yeast-like” minute corpuscles (gemmules) which are sprouted off from the short
branches in the cells, and which then go on budding until they fill up the space,
appear to be the only reproductive organs which exist.

But, in view of Breren’s recent discoveries as to the extensive “ yeast” formation
which goes on in the Ustilaginese,* it seems not at all improbable that this character
may be in favour of, rather than against, the alliance of this Fungus to the
Ustilaginese.

In fact, 1 regard the Fungus as one of the Ustilaginez, which has become so closely
adapted to its life as a parasite in the roots of the Leguminose that it has come to
stimulate and tax its host in an exquisitely well-balanced manner, and has lost its
needless true resting-spores because the more numerous and tiny sprouting yeast-
cells (gemmules) are kept in the cells of the tubercle through the dry summer
and autumn, and freed during the rotting in the soil in the winter and spring.
Their very minuteness and numbers enable these “germs” to become as ubiqui-
tous as “ Bacteria” or ordinary “ Yeast” forms, thus explaining the ubiquity of the
tubercles.

Breretp has shown that the ordinary resting-spores of the Ustilaginee, which
usually take a long time to germinate in pure water, will germinate much more rapidly
in nutritive solutions, and that several species can be made to develope their promycelia
