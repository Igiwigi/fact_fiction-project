by electrical excitation of the columns of the cord.

(1.) The Electrical Changes in the Posterior Roots when the Spinal Centres are Excited —
by Strychnia. i

The most remarkable illustrations of the fact that impulses emerge from a dis- —
charging spinal centre on its afferent as well as its efferent side, is that furnished by —
the following experiments. .

In a Cat (211) the cord was divided as usual in the lower dorsal region (11th
dorsal) and both sciatic nerves exposed and divided. The central end of each nerve ~
was connected when desired with the galvanometer. The cauda equina was then
exposed, and the posterior roots of the 5th, 6th and 7th lumbar nerves, and those of
the Ist and 2nd sacral, were divided on the right side, whilst the anterior roots of :
the same nerves were divided on the left side.

The right nerve was thus in connection with the cord by its anterior roots only,
the left by its posterior. Thirty minims of a 1 per cent. solution of acetate of
