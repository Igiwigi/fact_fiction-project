and the former salt passes entirely into subphosphate of soda, which crystallizes
in the usnal form, and contains not pyrophosphoric but phosphoric acid. This
change takes place equally well although both the carbonate and pyrophos-
phate be made anhydrous before being calcined ; and we can obtain conse-
quently an anhydrous subphosphate of soda. A solution of pyrophosphate of
soda, to which sufficient caustic soda or carbonate of soda has been added,
cannot be evaporated to dryness without becoming subphosphate. But pyro-
phosphate of soda may be boiled with caustic soda for hours without sensible
alteration, provided the solution is not evaporated to dryness ; and it crystal-
lizes afterwards in its original form, exhibiting no disposition whatever to form
a subpyrophosphate.

I may premise thus early, that the preceding facts, and many others to be
afterwards enumerated, appear to be most easily explained on the hypothesis
that phosphoric acid, in contradistinction to pyrophosphoric, is characterized
by a disposition to unite with three atoms of base ;â€”that common phos-
phate of s0da, for instance, is a phosphate of soda and of water, and that its
symbol is N@IHP. Now for this basic water an atom of any of the usual
bases may be substituted ; an atom of soda, for instance, as in our subphos-
phate, of which the symbol is N as P; an atom of oxide of silver, as in the
yellow subphosphate of silver; and $0 in the other subphosphates. We
have here a clue also to the disposition of phosphoric acid to form such sub-
sesquisalts ; for the common phosphate of soda which we use as a precipitant
