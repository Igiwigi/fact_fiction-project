The question of resolvability, therefore, I think, must remain to be taken up separately,
when the finest instrumental means are available, and when it may no longer be neces-
8ary to subject the specula to the wear and tear of constant work. As to the nebule which have nuclei, some are described as increasing in brightness
very gradually to the centre, others very rapidly, and some as having a stellar nucleus,
or perhaps a star in the centre. These descriptions, however accurately conveying the
impressions made upon the eye at the time, cannot be taken as in all cases representing
real physical facts. A star may have been mistaken for a condensed nucleus, or the
reverse ; and it is often impossible to 8ay which of the two suppositions is the more pro-
bable. The remarks as to the question of resolvability apply with equal force to the
questions relating to the structure of nuclei.
