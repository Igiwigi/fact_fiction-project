To repeat, representation of movement in the cortex is
found only on the summits of the gyri of the convoluted surface, and the approach of
a sulcus dimpling the cortex at all makes it at once inexcitable. This, true of the
Bonnet, is still more marked in the Orang, where, in addition, as will be seen, we have
slands of smooth cortex, even between foci, which are inexcitable. In the yet more highly divided human cortex this principle naturally must be held
to prevail with still more force, as seems, in fact, to be the case, see p. 152, et seq. MOTOR CORTEX AND INTERNAL CAPSULE IN AN ORANG-OUTANG. 133
Mernop oF INVESTIGATION. In accordance with our present mode of recording the results of excitation of the
cortex cerebri, we proceeded to expose and explore the surface of the so-called motor
region in the left hemisphere in the following manner :—

1, Anesthetisation.—The animal was thoroughly narcotised with ether.
