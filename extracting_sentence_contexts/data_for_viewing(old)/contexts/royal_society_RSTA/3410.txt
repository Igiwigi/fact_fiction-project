quantum fluctuations becomes increasingly important when reducing the dimensionality, these aes
phenomena are particularly relevant for one-dimensional systems. 22

QPS have been observed in different condensed-matter systems, such as superconducting : Ss
nanowires [7-11] and Josephson junction arrays [12]. In these systems, it is typically possible to DN
control the generation of QPS by changing the temperature or the current. Recently, QPS have : S
been proposed for applications such as topologically protected qubits [13,14] or as quantum : s

standard for the electrical current [12].

In 1967, Little introduced the notion of phase slip due to TAPS [1] to describe the
finite resistance below Tc in thin wires made of superconductive material. At any non-zero
temperature, in fact, each segment of a thin wire has a finite probability to become a normal
conductor, for a very short time, due to phase-slip events. Each of these fluctuations could disrupt
the persistent current and confer a non-zero resistance to the wire. This resistance, defined by an
Arrhenius-type equation, drops exponentially with cooling but remains finite at any non-zero
temperature as an effect of TAPS events. The height of the energy barrier 5F depends on several
parameters, like the cross-sectional area of the wire, and decreases when increasing the applied
current [1]. A more precise theory for TAPS was developed by Langer & Ambergaokar [4], and
later completed by McCumber & Halperin [5]. Any thermal activation over a barrier is dominated
by quantum tunnelling at sufficiently low temperatures and phase slips should be induced
by quantum fluctuation of the order parameter. The first observation of QPS was reported by
Giordano [2], in experiments with thin In and PbIn wires. By studying the resistance of the
wires as a function of the temperature, Giordano observed a crossover from thermally activated
behaviour near Tc to a more weakly temperature-dependent resistance tail at lower temperatures
