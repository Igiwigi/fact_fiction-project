body, rather looking at other targets, and engages in concur- poste rior

waiting for a response. A does not merely wait for B’s
response, but treats it as expectable; not only does she inter-
pret his conduct as an absence of response, but she displays
the fact that this response is consequential and therefore
normatively expected.

In summary, in the cases analysed so far, an individual
approaches another one, initiating a sequence in which they
perform a hindquarters’ presentation; the co-participant
addressed either responds by engaging in haptic contact or

An alternative configuration to the one previously discussed is
constituted by an individual A approaching another individual
B, who is statically positioned. Whereas in the previous cases A
was presenting their posterior, projecting B’s response, in these
cases, B presents theirs, projecting A’s haptic response. Thus,
