to be accurately measured by means of any ordinary form of ballistic galvanomel
joined in circuit with a second, or induction, coil surrounding the iron,

It occurred to me, somewhat more than a year ago, that the cause of the diffieul
in the ordinary method of measuring magnetic quality in large masses of iron mig
be made an advantage if the method of experiment were changed, that, in fact, th
desired information might be more easily obtained by recording, not the total yal
of the induction for each of several particular values of the magnetizing force, but th
curve showing the rise of current with time, immediately after the circuit is clos
Preliminary experiments showed that, for many of the cases most difficult by the
ordinary method, this could be done both accurately and easily. In these preliminary —
experiments the coils of a large electromagnet, having laminated cores and pole pieces
were joined in circuit with a storage battery and a non-inductive resistance, An aut
matic arrangement was devised, by means of which the circuit could be closed and
the instant of closing recorded by a chronograph. The ends of the non-inductiye |
resistance were at the same time connected to the quadrants of an electrometer,
any desired interval after the closing of the circuit the electrometer could be di
nected from the resistance, and the instant of disconnecting recorded by the cml
graph.
