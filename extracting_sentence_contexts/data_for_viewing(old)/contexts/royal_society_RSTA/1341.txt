(ii) Economic benefit contribution

To compute the economic benefit contributed by any single area, one needs to quantify the
cost reduction gained by the multi-area cooperating TSO group thanks to using the intra-area
grid flexibility resources in a mutually acceptable manner. In other words, the economic benefit
contributed by any single area is defined as the difference between the optimal objective of (3.2)
and the system-wide cost computed with the baseline decisions the respective TSO would take if
it was using its grid flexibility resources independently.

To find such what-if decisions, we model a fictitious situation wherein the TSO would be
deciding autonomously and without any consideration for the physical parameters and security
domains of all external areas in the interconnected system. We do so for any single area with grid
flexibility by solving a modified security management problem wherein the area of interest is
the only intra-area network modelled in full detail and all other intra-area networks are reduced
to simplified ideal mediums. As an example, figure 2 illustrates the reduction of the multi-area
system shown in the top part of figure 1 used to identify baseline grid flexibility decisions within
area A.

In the compact notation, we will employ symbol g" to denote the baseline intra-area grid
flexibility decisions that would be taken independently by control area (a) as well as function
f+a(m, x, g,14q) for the multi-area system alternative physical model, when area (a) is the only
area not represented by its controllable simplification (i.e. the only area modelled in full detail).
