þ IN BEAMS SUBJECTED TO TRANSVERSE STRAIN. 471
transverse strain, the beam being supposed to be supported at the centre F. and loaded
at its extremities.
- In this change of figure it will be observed that there are three effects ;—
- First, an extension of the fibres or particles, commencing at the neutral axis lm.
and increasing to the upper portion of the beam.
© Secondly, a compression of the fibres or particles from the neutral axis to the lower
portions of the beam ; and

Thirdly, the planes or surfaces alc and bmd are forced downwards to the distance ep,
wo and fg.

There are, in fact, two distinct changes of figure :—
