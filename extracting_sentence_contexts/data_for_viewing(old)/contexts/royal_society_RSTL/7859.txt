The floating motes resembled minute particles of liquid which had been carried me-

chanically into the experimental tube. Precautions were therefore taken to prevent” any::
such transfer. They produced little or no mitigation. I did not imagine at. the time
that the dust of the external air could find snch free passage through the caustic potash
and the sulphuric-acid tubes. But the motes really came from without. They also passed
with freedom through a variety of ethers and alcohols placed in the flask F. In fact, it
requires long-continued action on the part of an acid first to wet the motes and afterwards
to destroy them. By carefully passing the air through the flame of a spirit-lamp or
through a platinum tube heated to bright redness, the floating matter was sensibly
destroyed. It was therefore combustible, in other words, organic matter®. I tried to
intercept it by a large respirator of cotton-wool tied round the end of the tube tf.
Close pressure was necessary to render the wool effective. A. plug of the wool rammed
pretty tightly into the tube #?' was finally found competent to hold back the motes.
'They appeared from time to time afterwards and gaye me much trouble; but they were
invariably traced in the end to some defect in the purifying-apparatus,—to some crack
or flayy in the sealing-wax used to render the tubes air-tight, Without due care, more-
over, liquid particles may also be carried mechanically oyer. 'To prevent the entrance
