On the side
of longer wave-lengths, however, a limit to the reading of the spectra was ultimately
imposed by the crowding of the lines into an almost continuous spectrum as the disper-
sive power of the prism diminished. When dealing with crowded spectra the problem of recognising the lines and determin-
ing their wave-length correctly was of predominant importance, since much more trouble
was experienced in this process of identification than in locating the exact positions of
the extinctions. We were, however, helped very greatly by the fact that two photographie
enlargements of the are spectrum of iron had already been prepared for use in measure-
ments of absorption-spectra, and several hundred of the brighter lines had been identified
(with the help of a copper spectrum photographed alongside) and labelled. One of these
enlargements included the whole of the spectrum as transmitted through a dispersive
system composed of two glass prisms, from the green at wave-length 5383 to the early
ultra-violet wave-length 3491. The other spectrum, transmitted through a quartz-
calcite train and dispersed by two pairs of quartz prisms, covered the range from wave-
length 3542 to the point at wave-length 2327, at which the iron spectrum diminishes
suddenly in intensity and becomes unsuitable for polarimetric work.
