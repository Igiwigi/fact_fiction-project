(20) The position of a stagnation point for a flow without circulation was deter-
mined by re-plotting the traced part of the stream-line (~, = 0) on as large a scale
as was consistent with the experimental accuracy, and then producing this line to meet
the aerofoil surface at right angles. This method was adopted because a direct measure-
ment of the position could not be made. These results are given in Col. (c), Table V.

The position of the stagnation point for a flow with circulation was obtained in
the same way, that is, by drawing the zero stream-line (), -+- ¥, =0) through the
points estimated from the electrical-tank results. Representative stream-lines of this
type are given in fig. 14 (see later, § 22). The points on these lines represent actual
values estimated from the electrical tank. Reference to this figure shows that the
stream-lines were plotted in the tank to a distance of 0-015 chord from the nose. The
shape near the aerofoil was then determined from the fact that each line must meet the
surface at right angles. It was found by trial that there is very little latitude when
fixing the shape of a stream-line at the aerofoil surface, and that uncertainties in the
