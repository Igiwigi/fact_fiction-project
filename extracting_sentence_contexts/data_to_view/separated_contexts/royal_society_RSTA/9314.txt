Its relative magnitude increases with the percentage
2 of carbon, as fig. 1 shows, until the specimen containing 0'7 per cent. of carbon is

‘4 reached. After that, it is difficult to decide whether the ratio of the rapid fall

3 (below 740° C.) to the subsequent fall, before the magnetisation becomes too small to
be measurable, depends appreciably upon the percentage of carbon. The first important fact, then, is that the sudden loss of magnetism begins at the
= same temperature in all the steels. This accords with the view that the eutectoid
£& patches, detected by the microscope, have always the same composition. It might
; also suggest that this constant temperature is the true transition point between
eutectoid and homogeneous solid solution.
