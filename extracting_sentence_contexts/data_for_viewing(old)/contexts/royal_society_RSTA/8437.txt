At the same time the sum to infinity of the series in the bracket is given by putting
AD = 1 in §8.1 (1), (2). The question then is: how small must / be in order that

The convergence is faster if h?D*p (2) < p(x). Thatis to say if p (7) = e” the conver-
gence will be faster than that indicated in the table provided that ;

If 12D2p (x) = — p(x), we put hD = VY —1 in §8.1 (1), (2), (5), (6), thus changing
