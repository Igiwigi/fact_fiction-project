month, ‘21. Much to my regret I cannot support this conclusion by actual figures, as
Karasjok was so enclosed by low hills that it was impossible to obtain even a rough
arbitrary scale of the clearness of the air by the visibility of distant objects. But
there can be no doubt that the maximum of the transparency of the atmosphere
corresponded with the maximum of the ionization.

Potential Gradient.—The yearly course of the potential gradient in Karasjok
conforms to the general rule for the northern hemisphere formulated by Hann* in
the following words: ‘The maximum of the potential gradient occurs in December,
January or February ; it falls rapidly in the spring; remains nearly at the same level
during the summer and then rapidly rises again in October and November.”

The fact that the potential gradient runs so exactly opposite to the dissipation
makes it appear as though there were a constant charge of negative electricity being
continually given to the surface of the earth during the whole year, and that the
amount at any moment on the surface itself (measured, of course, by the potential
gradient) is determined by the rate at which the charge is being dissipated. How
this charge is supplied to the earth still remains, in spite of many theories, one of the
unsolved problems of atmospheric electricity.

Two types of daily variation of the potential gradient are known.f The first is a
double period, having a minimum between 3 and 5 A.M. and a second about midday,
the corresponding maxima falling at about 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Good examples ot
this are Batavia and Paris. The other type consists of a single maximum and
minimum, the former falling in the evening and the latter between 3 and 5 a.m. To
