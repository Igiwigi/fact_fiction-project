We further transform the localized system on H, [j as
V(X Xn) = (Wo MY, Xn) = UL Xn +HG(Xâ€™)), Xn) ERY. (2.5)

The resulting system for v then is an equation on R?.. Summarizing, by this procedure the Stokes
resolvent problem on a domain is reduced to finitely many equations on R'} or R". A fundamental problem arising here is the fact that div u = 0 is not preserved, neither under
multiplication with a cut-off function nor by transformation (2.5). This might be the reason why
proofs of the analyticity of the Stokes semigroup on domains rely on different methods and
different assumptions are being imposed, depending on the approaches being used. In order to start the above localization procedure various representation formulas for the
solution of the Stokes equation on the half space R'| have been developed by Solonnikov [33],
McCracken [34], Ukai [35] and Desch, Hieber & Priiss [15].
