The present, approximate, northern boundaries of the distribution areas of some of
the Angiosperm families and genera which are represented in the Greenland Cretaceous
flora are also indicated, and for these I am indebted to my friend Mr. Ronatp
Goop. The northern boundaries of the families and genera shown in Map II must be regarded
as only approximations to the facts of geographical distribution. Thus a member of the
Menispermaces, Cocculus pendulus Dieus, is recorded from localities in Egypt and
elsewhere farther north than the line drawn for the family. Map II.
