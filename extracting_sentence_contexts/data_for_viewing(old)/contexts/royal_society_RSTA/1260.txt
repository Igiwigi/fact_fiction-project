Proof. The main idea is that Theorem 5.3 provides the right estimate to generalize the proof of
BrzeZniak & Peszat’s [58, Theorem 1.2]. The proof will use some additional facts from stochastic
analysis which are all standard and can be found in [36,66].

Step 1. Let us first assume that g € L™®(2;L?(0,T; y(H, X))) is such that for every t €[0,T], we
have g; € D(A(t)) and tr A(t)g; belongs to 1°(0,T; y(H, X)) almost surely. Under this assumption,
we claim that u is a strong solution, i.e. almost surely we have

This means that the assumptions of Theorem 5.3 are satisfied with a; = A(t)u:. In order to prove
(5.8), we set uy = Sb S(t,s)gs Ws. Then
