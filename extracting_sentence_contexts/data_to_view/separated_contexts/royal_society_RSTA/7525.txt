SEARS ON THE REFRACTION AND

absorption lines in the infra-red, their influence in lowering the value of n in the visible
region is negligible. We may therefore write
XL Dmal Yn —¥?)] = Xml Dinh + (2%)? + (PP m)* + «3
= ZnLDintd + Amd)? + (Am/A)*+ +3]
= a, +b A*+6,A-*+...,
where a,, b, and c, are constants and A is the wave-length in vacuo of the incident radiation. For most gases, and in particular for air in the visible spectrum, three terms of the
expansion are sufficient to represent the observed facts with high accuracy, so that

(n2—1) = [ag-+b,A-2+-c,d-4] d. (6-2)

This equation and the corresponding equation for the Lorenz-Lorentz expression
(1:3), namely,

(n?—1)|(n2+2) = [a5 +bgl-2-+0,-4] d, (6-3)

are based on theoretical relations concerned with the propagation of light through a
transparent medium. With a gas under normal conditions the value of (n—1) is small, so that, if we put
(n—1) =r, then the equations (6-1), (6-2) and (6-3), respectively, may be written
in the following forms, since (n?—1) = 2r+r? = 2r(1+17/2) and (n?—1)/(n?+2) =
(2r+-7?)/(8+2r+7?) = 2r(1—7/6)/3:

re [a,-+b,A-2-+-¢,A-4] d, (6-4)
r = (1—1/2) [ay +b,d-2+-c,d-4] d/2, (6-5)
r= (1+1/6) [ay +-byd-2-+¢,A-4] 34/2. (6-6)

To a first approximation, since 7 is small, equations (6-5) and (6-6) reduce to the same
form as (6-4), in which, for a given radiation, the refractivity is proportional to density,
but it is also evident that if the measurements of refractivity of gases are of sufficiently
high accuracy it may be possible to distinguish between the three relations. Striking experimental confirmation of the Lorenz-Lorentz relation for gases was, in
fact, obtained by Magri (1905), who made determinations of the refractivity of air at
densities corresponding to pressures from about 1 to 200 atm., using a Jamin refracto-
meter with the green line of mercury (A = 5461 A).
