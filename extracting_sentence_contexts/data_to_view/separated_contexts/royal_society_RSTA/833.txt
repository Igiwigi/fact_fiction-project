It is to be noticed that since the functions ey, eb’, eGo and e*H,! are
all single-valued, the expressions ws, v3, #3 are in all cases the gradient of a single-
valued function. ‘This fact is of importance with reference to the calculation of
the lift in section 10.

8—Tue Conpirion ror No Tora Flow

The solutions of equations (3.1) and (3.2) obtained in §§ 4 and 7 are entirely
independent, except for one condition, namely, that there can be no total flow
across any large surface in the fluid. Consider now a large sphere 2, which is
everywhere at a great distance from the solid S, and whose radius r is ultimately
made infinite. Then the condition for no total flow is
