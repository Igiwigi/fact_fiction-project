Whether, therefore, we consider the facts of agriculture generally, or confine
attention to special cases under known experimental conditions, the evidence does not
favour the supposition that a balance is maintained by the restoration of nitrogen

from the large store of it existing in the free state in the atmosphere. Further, our
original soil-supplies of nitrogen are, as a rule, due to the accumulations by natural
vegetation, with little or no removal, over long periods of time; or, as in the case of
many deep subsoils, the nitrogen is largely due to vegetable and animal remains,
intermixed with the mineral deposits. The agricultural production of the present age
is, in fact, so far as its nitrogen is concerned, mainly dependent on previous accumula-
tions; and as in the case of the use of coal for fuel there is not coincident and cor-
responding restoration, so in that of the use or waste of the combined nitrogen of the

soil, there is not evidence of coincident and corresponding restoration of nitrogen from
the free to the combined state. In the case of agricultural production for sale, without restoration by manure from
external sources, a very important condition of the maintenance of the amount of
nitrogen in the surface soil, or of the diminished exhaustion of it, is the growth of
plants of various range and character of roots, and especially of leguminous crops. Such plants, by their crop-residue, enrich the surface soil in nitrogen.
