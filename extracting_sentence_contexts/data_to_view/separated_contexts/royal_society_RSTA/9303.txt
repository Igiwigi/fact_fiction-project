Tt is evident, from the above records, that the hydrogen-air mixture is by far the
“fastest burning” of the three mixtures investigated, the maximum pressure being
reached in approximately one-tenth of the time taken in the case of the slowest
burning carbon-monoxide mixtures (0°01 as compared with 0°10 seconds). The time required for the attainment of maximum pressure in the case of the
methane air mixtures (0°05 to 0°08 seconds) was at least five times as long as that
required in the case of the hydrogen-air mixtures, notwithstanding the fact that the
affinity of methane is something like twenty times as great as that of hydrogen for
oxygen in flames. Apparently, therefore, there is no direct relation between the
actual rate at which the potential energy of an explosive mixture is transferred on
