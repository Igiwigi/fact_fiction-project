(3.) Closely connected with the occurrence of incomplete septa is their variable
thickness, and this has been described in detail. From the usual septum, consisting
of sonie two or three layers of permanent tissue, with transitory layers of tapetum
on either side, all gradations of thinning off of the septum may be found in Danea,
to the condition of a simple tapetal layer (fig. 28), and even onwards to the mere
encroachment of tapetal cells into the simple sporogenous group.

(4.) The occasional development in Danwa of cells outside the definite sporogenous
group as fertile cells (fig. 21), and conversely of cells of the sporogenous group as
sterile cells (figs. 22, 23), shows that the fertile tissue is not so strictly defined in this
genus as it is usually found to be in other ferns.

Now it is possible to read these facts as consistent with either a view of progressive
coalescence of sporangia originally separate, or of a progressive septation of a less
completely septate sorus. If the former view be taken, then the sorus of Danaa,
which shows the features mentioned more commonly than other genera, would be
held to have been descended from a type with sori even more elongated than those of
the present day. But Danaea is the genus of Marattiacew which has the longest
sori known in the family. I am not aware that any genus of Eusporangiate ferns,
fossil or modern, has been described with sori longer than Danwa, and with separate
sporangia. In the absence of evidence that any such supposititious ancestor ever
existed, the view that the above phenomena in the sorus of Danwa imply coalescence
of sporangia previously distinct appears to me to be without proper foundation.

But if we contemplate the converse view, that the characters described are evidence
