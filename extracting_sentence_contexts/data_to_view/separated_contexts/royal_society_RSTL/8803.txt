It is interesting to compare the aboye work of gunpowder with the total theoretic
work of 1 gramme of coal, which is about 3,400,000 gramme-units. The work stored
up in one gramme of coal is therefore more than ten times as great as that stored up
in 1 gramme of powder. The powder, it is true, contains all the oxygen necessary for its own combustion, while
the coal draws nearly 3 grammes of oxygen from the air, Even allowing, however,
for this, there is a considerable inferiority in the work done by gunpowder, which is
doubtless in part due to the fact that the coal finds its oxygen already in the form of
gas, while a considerable amount of work is expended by the gunpowder in placing its
oxygen in a similar condition. In an economic point of view also the oxygen stored up in the gunpowder is of no im-
portance, as that consumed by coal costs nothing, while the oxygen in the powder is in a
most expensive form. The fact is perhaps worth noting as demonstrating the impracticabi-
lity of making economic engines deriving their motive power from the force of gunpowder.
