(6) The test increased in thickness.

(7) The periplastronal areas, originally smooth, became ornamented with small tuber-
cules. This ornamentation became progressively more pronounced.

(8) The petals became shallower and increased in length.

(9) The petals became more ornamented, passing through the stages called by Rowe
smooth, sutured, inflated, subdivided and divided.

It is clear from his paper that Rowe considered his Epzaster gibbus to be very closely
related to Micraster, and, in fact, to be derived from it. He intended, in a subsequent
paper, to deal with this species, along with the high zonal micrasters, but this paper was
unfortunately never written. :

The present paper will deal with four main topics:

(1) The relationship between M. senonensis and M. coranguinum.

(2) The relative growth rates of a number of characters in Micraster. A consideration
of these was found to be of value in elucidating the systematics of the genus.

(3) The relationships between a number of characters, considered in a population
from a single locality and a single zone. The results, when compared with the re-
