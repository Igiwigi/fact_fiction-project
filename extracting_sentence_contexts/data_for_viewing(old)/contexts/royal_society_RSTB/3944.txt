or not.

The number of individuals available for this investigation is less than for the
previous one, owing to the fact that of course all those pairs of which the two
members were of equal size, or of which one died, had to be rejected. The number
left, however, is quite large enough for our purposes. Altogether 135 such pairs
could be utilised for birth measurements and 100 for adult measurements. The
results are given in Table V.

In reading this table, the following points must be kept in mind :â€”

(1) The measurements here used are the actual not the corrected ones, Correction
was unnecessary owing to the fact that the two lines of a single clone naturally kept
nearly synchronous in their development from generation to generation, so that an
allowance for conditions changing between corresponding points in their life-history
was not so urgent ;

(2) The differences between the large and small parents gives an exaggerated idea
of the extent of intraclonal (environmental) variation, owing to the fact that all
those pairs of which the members were equal had to be omitted. If they were
included, the mean difference between the large and small members of pairs would be
much reduced ; 54 pairs had to be omitted from the birth measurements and 28 from
the adult measurements because the members were equal ;
