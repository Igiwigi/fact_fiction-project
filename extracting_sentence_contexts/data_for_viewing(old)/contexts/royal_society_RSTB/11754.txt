Using a new technique, my colleagues and I have found a way
to escape this dilemma and have shown that inattentional blind-
ness truly is a deficit of perception [24]. The usual account of
inattentional blindness is that it is due to a lack of any expec-
tations about the unexpected events. But what if instead of
having no expectations, participants formed a specific expec-
tation about what type of unexpected event was to occur?
If this were the case, participants could be given the instruction
to immediately report seeing anything unexpected, but if the
unexpected event did not match their specific expectation, they

would still experience inattentional blindness paradigm (if it
were in fact a perceptual deficit).

Using a sustained inattentional blindness (e.g. [23,33]), we
showed participants a display containing the letters L and T
which could be either black or white and which moved ran-
domly across the screen. Participants counted how many
times the white Ls crossed the midline of the display. There
were four trials of this sort, but on the fifth trial, an unexpected
object—a dark red cross—slowly traversed the midline (bottom
row, figure 1). Immediately after this trial, participants were
asked if they noticed anything about the last trial, and then
asked whether they noticed that a dark red cross had appeared
on screen. We found that a substantial portion of the
