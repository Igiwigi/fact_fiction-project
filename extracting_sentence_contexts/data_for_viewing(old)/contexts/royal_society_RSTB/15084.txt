(with shorter treatment courses) and novel diagnostic tools
has been prioritized and invested upon for the IDM NTDs,
this aspect of research and development is equally important
for the PC NTDs. For all the NTDs, the great strides that
have been made have unmasked underlying heterogeneities,
such as local hotspots of transmission, or populations not
accessing treatments, which will need to be addressed to
reach the ambitious goals for the global programme. Addres-
sing these heterogeneities requires a better understanding of
the underlying epidemiology and necessitates new tools to
address them.

In fact, an issue linked to sustaining the successes gained in
the fight against the PC NTDs is the need for better and more
sensitive point-of-care diagnostics to ensure that pockets of
low-intensity infections can be detected. Exciting opportunities
exist in research laboratories based on parasite secretions
detectable in blood, urine or faeces. However, the challenge
is to convert these technical advances into low-cost diagnostics
suitable for use in resource-constrained settings. The contri-
bution of Kabbas-Pifiango and co-authors discusses the

importance of reproducibility and intra- and inter-sample vari-
ation of the point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen (POC-
CCA) test in high and low Schistosoma mansoni endemic
