We see
that the cells occupying quadrants where either (or both) inputs are equal to 1 do not give off light
(equivalent to an output value of 0); the few cells in the top-right corner that are doing so have
actually been pushed into that quadrant by other cells. Importantly, we show how a simple change in the definition of a ‘high’ input value (1) can
switch the circuit's functionality from NOR to NAND. The key to this is the fact that the NOR
circuit uses a particular molecular concentration to represent 1; by significantly reducing the input
concentration, the circuit ‘flips’ (without modification into NAND mode (the specifics of how this
works are beyond the scope of this review paper, but full details are given in [52]). In figure 2
(top), we see the results of another simulation, this time for the NAND case, in which we can
clearly see that the only quadrant in which the cells are not ‘on’ is (correctly) the one in which
both inputs are equal to 1. Figure 4 (adapted from [53]) shows a similar multicellular simulation of a distributed XOR gate
(comparator).
