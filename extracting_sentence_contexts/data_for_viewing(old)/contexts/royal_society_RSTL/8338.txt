petit which T was already familiar with en grand, and the 8maller variations in the
phenomena enabled me to understand them better.

I found that in the gold-copper standards an increase of a 1000th part in the gold
brought the lines down, while a similar increase in the copper carried them up, 7. #.
increased the height of the vapour from the pole.

T found, on the other hand, that in the silver-copper standards an increase of a 1000th
part in the silyer carried the lines up, while a similar increase in the copper brought
them down in the field of view, 4. e. reduced the height of the vapour from the pole.

After registering these facts, I saw at once that all the phenomena might be explained
by assuming a change of volatility ; by assuming, in fact, that alloys differing a 1000th
part are different physical things, and that the spark acts upon the alloy as a whole as
well as upon each vapour separately.

Thus in the cases referred to, in which copper is common to both, we find the
melting-points to be as follows :—

Gold . . . 1200? (Povnuen).
Copper between 1200® and 10007, precise point not determined.
Silver . . . 1000* (PoviLLen).

And the intermediate position which copper occupies at once explains the different
