In the previous sections, we described the phase behaviour of MG and PC when mixed with
other components. It was shown that one can control the formation of a specific phase. We now
describe briefly how the use of a specific SAS can bring advantages for a given application. As
mentioned in the Introduction, SASs are largely used for sustained release of drugs, nutrients and
aromas [52-56]. For release of glucose and the antiseptic proflavine, it was found that kinetics of
release increases when changing from a reversed bicontinuous cubic phase to a lamellar liquid
crystalline phase, then to a reversed hexagonal phase (H2) and finally, the reversed micellar cubic
phase leads to the more sustained release [53]. This effect was attributed to the dimension of the
water domain.

The structure which is probably the least described among the SASs based on MG and
PL is the reversed microemulsion. However, owing to its low viscosity and the fact that food
systems contain not only surfactants but also oils, but this phase is also probably the most


promising in terms of food applications. It was used for solubilizing crystalline molecules such
as phytosterol [15]. Hoppel et al. [12] did in vitro experiment to study the permeation through the
skin of the anti-inflammatory molecule, diclofenac sodium. This drug was solubilized in particles
having various SASs. The maximum permeation through the skin was observed for the reverse
microemulsion, followed by the reversed micellar structure, the reversed hexagonal and finally,
the reversed bicontinuous cubic phase leads to the least permeation [12].

As we will see, the reverse microemulsion phase has also large applications for reactivity
control.
