are, therefore, unclear; we evidently provided a balanced argument that did not
simply restate assumptions but evaluated them against other pieces of pub-
lished work. It also does not ‘rely heavily on unpublished material’; the work
of Grant et al. [5] is a formally published document with an ISBN which is
freely available online or in print, and the study of Lee et al. [6] is published
in the Journal of Applied Ecology.

Ina second example, with reference to Brown et al. [4], Davies et al. [1, p. 9]
stated:

Brown et al. also point to government guidelines that ‘recommend against burning
into living moss layers’ but then comment that ‘this level of control is not always
achievable’. Notwithstanding the fact that the fuel moisture content of moss layers
during the legal burning period are often high enough to make deep combustion
physically impossible in all but the most severe droughts, there is good evidence
that moss consumption during prescribed burns is very limited and that exposure
of bare peat is rare.

Yet Davies et al. [1] have not suggested: that deep combustion is physically
impossible in all cases of prescribed burning; that moss consumption is zero
