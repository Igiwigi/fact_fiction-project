The iron spectrum ceases to be of real value beyond a wave-length of 2327 A.U. In
order to bridge the gap between this point and the ultimate limit of transmission of light
through the calcite polarising-prisms and lenses, a few photographs were taken with
electrodes of copper and of silver-cadmium alloy, The cadmium lines were regarded as
of special interest in view of their employment by Sorer and Sarasin in 1882, but in
the region beyond the international series of standard iron lines the wave-lengths of
the cadmium lines are still so uncertain that no value can be attached to a comparison

of the observed and calculated rotations ; in fact, if any use were to be made of the
readings in this distant region, it would be as a means of predicting wave-lengths rather
than rotatory powers. Only in the case of the silver lines have we found anything to
compare with the close agreement of the observed and calculated rotations which is so
marked a feature of all the calculations based on the new and accurate wave-lengths
for the principal iron lines.

In the earlier experiments the are was burnt between common iron bolts (} inch in
diameter and 3 inches long), with the heads sawed off. These were screwed into copper
cylinders and mounted in an apparatus (see fig. 1, Part I, p. 268), whereby the two elec-
trodes were made to rotate on their axes in opposite directions in order to keep the
position of the are steady. Dr. J.O. Currr has, however, since found that equally good
results can be obtained by allowing the arc to burn between a small vertical electrode,
