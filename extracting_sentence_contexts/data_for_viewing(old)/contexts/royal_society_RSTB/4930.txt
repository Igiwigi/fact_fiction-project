would thus have to be of a circular or rotatory type superposed on the driving couple
transmitted from the motor to the wooden pulleys, and might be due to the smallness
of the number of the motor’s commutator parts. Its frequency would in that case be
high, and a substance like soft rubber might be used to absorb it. The rod R was
therefore cut, and its cut ends joined by a block of soft rubber, two of the incubators
being on the motor side and three on the other side of the rubber. The eggs in the
three should thus be less affected by the hypothetical vibrations than those in the
two. The results are given in Table IV., 7 and 8, and also in Table V., where they have
been rendered comparable by altering the percentages hatched from motor-turned eggs
to what they would have been if 60 per cent. of the hand-turned eggs had hatched
in each case. Thus 42 = 34 x $8 and so on. In both hatches the motor-turned eggs
beyond the rubber have hatched much better than those that were not protected in
this way, and the conclusion seems to be justified that the rubber block did, in fact,
partly absorb some high-frequency vibration and prevent its reaching the eggs.
