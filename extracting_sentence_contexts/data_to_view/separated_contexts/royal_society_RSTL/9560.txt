When
then inverted and forced to use their mutilated pedicel-rows, the Zchins reared them-
elves upon their equators, and then, having no more pedicels wherewith to continue
the manceuvyre, came to rest, This res was permanent—the animal remaining, if
accidents were excluded, upon its equator till it died. The question, then, here seems
to resolve itself simply into this :—Is the mechanism of the pedicels 80 constructed as
to ensure that their serial action shall always take place in the 8ame direction ; for if
it can be shown that their serial action may take place indifferently in either direction,
it would follow that the persistency with which the partly-shaved ZEchini continue
reared upon their equators, is the expression of some stimulus (ﬆch as a sense of
gravity) continuously acting upon some central apparatus, and impelling the latter to
a continuous, though fruitless, endeavour to co-ordinate the absent pedicels. If the
pedicels are able to act serially in either direction, there is no more reason why a
partly-shaved Zchinus should remain permanently reared upon its equator, than that
it should remain permanently. inverted upon its pole ; and therefore the fact that in
the latter position the pedicels set about an immediate rotation of the animal, while in
the former and quite as unnatural position they hold the animal in persistent stagis—
this fact tends to show that the righting moyements of the pedicels are something
more than serial. Thus the whole question as between the two hypotheses amounts
to whether the pedicels are able to act serially from oral to ab-oral pole. Observation
has shown us that they are 80, for we have een Zchini spontaneously rear themselyes
from their normal position on the oral pole, to the position of resting upon their
equators.
