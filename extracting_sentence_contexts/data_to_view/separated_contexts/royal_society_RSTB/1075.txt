This explanation holds good as far as the unsteadi
irregular movements are concerned, but there are other symptoms included und
term inco-ordination which cannot be accounted for in this way. Rotation mo
and reeling in some particular direction, are, I take it, the results of subjectit
tions of Joss of balance, which however result in objective phenomena directl
over-action. It is a significant fact that rotation movements only occur in un
lesions of the cerebellum, and that they do not occur when both lateral lob
whole organ is removed. Possibly the reason why the animal rotates to t
side after section of one middle peduncle,t and to the opposite side after re
one lateral lobe of the cerebellum, as found by Lucranr and myself, is bee
excitation involved in section of the peduncle generates in excess the very imprel
which are lost when the lateral lobe is absent. -Or it may be that the auditoryie
was injured in those experiments in which the middle peduncle was divided
case, as we have seen, if rotation occurs, it is to the side of the lesion. Anesthesia and analgesia after destruction of parts of the cerebellum poir
organ as exercising sensory as well as motor functions, and it is interesting’
that the limbs paresed are those in which there is blunting of sensibility:
fact pointing to the resemblance of the cerebellum to the “sensori-motor” cor

the cerebrum.
