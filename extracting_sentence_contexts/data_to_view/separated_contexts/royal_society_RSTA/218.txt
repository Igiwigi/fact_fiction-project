(A closer starting estimate could have been based on curve D
if this had been available.) Again the convergence is oscillatory but rapid. The case
A = 3 was in fact treated last, though it might have preceded the case A — 4.

26. In figure 8 the broken-line curve (‘final A for given A’) is compared with ‘exact?
results, taken from (F. & S. 1941),* which are shown by open circles. The agreement
throughout the range (which more than covers all cases having practical reality) is as
close as could be desired.
