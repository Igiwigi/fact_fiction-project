the case of embryo Sphenodon. The progressive fusion subsequently undergone by
these primitive arteries also supports the suggestion advanced by Denpy (1909), that
the condition of the arteria basilaris of adult Sphenodon being reminiscent of an
ancestral paired condition is a primitive feature. In general, it may be remarked, the
results now recorded confirm, and to some extent supplement, those obtained by the
latter investigator. The persistence of the ductus caroticus and ductus arteriosus
now noted has already been recorded in adult Sphenodon by O’DonoGuus (1917), as
has also the presence of the arteria laryngealis, pulmonalis and cervict: muscularis
of either side. The progressive reduction and ultimate fate of the 1st and 2nd aortic
arches has already been noted, and it is now necessary only to recall the presence of
the newly-identified branches of the arteria stapedialis (the arteriw tympanica,
dentalis inferior, temporalis posterior and auricularis posterior), and to record the
fact that Sphenodon is similar to other Reptilia in respect of the persistence and
primitive nature of the arteria stapedialis, which has been shown to be derived from
a persistent dorsal vestige of the 2nd aortic arch.

As regards the venous trunks of the auditory region the work of earlier observers
has been generally confirmed and, in certain respects, considerably supplemented.
