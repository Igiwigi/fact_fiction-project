primary xylem round the pith. These strands resemble those of Pitys in every
particular, except in their position. While in Pitys the strands are usually
imbedded in the pith and separated from the wood, in Callixylon they are usually in
contact with the wood, though sometimes separated from it by a few small cells.
Further, the secondary wood in Dr, ZALEssKy’s plant is arranged in wedges corres-
ponding to the primary strands, which is not the case in Pitys, Callixylon is clearly
much nearer to Pitys than to any other known genus, though the narrower rays and
other differences may justify generic separation.

Callixylon approaches Archwopitys in the fact that most of the primary xylem-
strands, like the cireum-medullary strands of the Kentucky plant, are in contact with
the wood. The wedge-like arrangement of the wood noticed in Callixylon also
appears to a certain extent in Archeopitys. On the other hand, there are no
strictly medullary strands in Callixylon, all the bundles lying close to the edge
of the wood.

The three genera, Pitys, Callixylon, and Archeopitys, certainly form a group of

allied plants, but we are not yet in a position to determine the exact relation between
them. All may be provisionally included in the family Pityez, which, in the present
state of our knowledge, appears to form a part of the alliance Cordaitales.*
