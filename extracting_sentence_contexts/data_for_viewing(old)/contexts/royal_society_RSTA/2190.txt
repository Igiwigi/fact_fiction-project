It follows that exp(té) = exp(QfaQ') for all t. Since exp is locally invertible in a neighbourhood of
zero [23], the above calculation, applied to a small enough t, implies that = Q6Q', so — has the
normal form (2.4). The normal form is completely determined by the eigenvalues, which are tia;
and +iw . Thus, two unequal matrices @ and @’ are orthogonally similar if and only if they differ
by an exchange of diagonal blocks, i.e. @ = tat! for the orthogonal matrix t in (2.3).

(ii) The eigenvalues of ® are tiw), +i. If these are distinct, then each pair uniquely defines
an invariant plane. If w; =, then (2.3) gives a change of coordinates leaving the form of ®
unchanged, showing that there is an infinite family of invariant planes. a

Remark 2.1. The preceding two propositions concern single elements of SO(4) or so(4). There is
a related result for subgroups of SO(4): any compact abelian subgroup is conjugate to a subgroup
of SOxy x SOz. This is a consequence of the Torus theorem for Lie groups [23], and the fact that
SOxy x SOz is a maximal torus in SO(4) [24].

Because of the properties just stated, many questions about SO(4) symmetries can be reduced
to questions about symmetries with respect to SO(2)xy x SO(2)zw. With the exception of §4b,
throughout the paper we consider the symmetries associated with this group, which we call the
double planar rotation group. The principal planes are Oxy and Ozw. Note that whenever an element
Re€SO(2)xy x SO(2)zw has uniquely defined invariant planes, they equal the principal planes; this
is also true for any & € so(2)xy x $0(2)zw.

Any element & of the Lie algebra so(4) determines a unique one parameter group R(t) := exp té,
and the derivative of this path at t = 0 is €. Given a ‘base point’ q € R¢, it follows that € determines
a path in R* given by (exp fé)q, and the derivative of this path at f =0 is &q (matrix product),
