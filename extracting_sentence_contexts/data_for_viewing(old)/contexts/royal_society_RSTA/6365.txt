Datalog is a logic programming language consisting of Horn clauses in which there are no
functions except constants [6]. We use this notation to define a subset of first-order logic that
we also call Datalog. We choose Datalog because it is decidable under SL and ABC requires!
decidability in the detection of faults. We represent formulae in Datalog as clauses in Kowalski
normal form, shown in definition 2.1 below.

Definition 2.1 (Datalog formulae). Let the language of a Datalog theory T be a triple (P,C, V),
where P are the propositions, C are the constants and VY are the variables. We will adopt the

'This requirement can be relaxed providing one is willing to accept a heuristic ABC. That is, proof attempts can be terminated
with failure when some time or space threshold is exceeded. So, a difficult to prove theorem might be wrongly classified as
unprovable. In fact, a predecessor of ABC was originally developed for the semi-decidable FOL [7].


convention that variables are written in lower case, and constants and predicates start with a ls |
capital letter.”

A proposition is a formula of the form P(t,...,tn), where te CUY for 1 <j <n, ie. there are 3
no compound terms. Let R € P and Q; € P for 0 <i< min T. Datalog clauses are of the four types 1S

in definition 2.2, R is called the head of the clause and the conjunction of the Q;s forms the body.
