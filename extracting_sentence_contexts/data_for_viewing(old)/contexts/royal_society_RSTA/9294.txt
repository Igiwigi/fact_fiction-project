tests applied were :-â€”

(a) The tap water was heated before entering the helix and it was found that a
change in telescope readings occurred at first, but that when the temperature became
steady, though raised, the readings became normal.

(b) More and yet more wrappings were put over the helixes, so that weak places, if
any existed, would be covered up. It will be observed that the numbers in column 2,

Table IV., vary for spheres from 209 to 175. This is due to the fact that as more
wrappings are used, the masses, M, M, can be swung through less angle; hence the
range is reduced. Thus we have some eight degrees of wrapping indicated in the
above table.

(c) The outer layer of cotton wool was covered with tin-foil, and several experiments
were performed in which the parts of the helix coverings, near the hot spheres, M, M,
were sprayed with tap water every two minutes. The experiments on dates 18th
August, 1915, and 19th August, 1915, in Table IV., were conducted thus. Tn this
way the helix coverings remain cool always.

Seeing then that similar results are obtained under all these varying conditions as
to temperature and conduetibility of the surface of the central tube containing the
