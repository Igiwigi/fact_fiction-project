that was fixed over the past 60 years [75-77]. Mixture values below the atmosphere in the year
of sampling reflect older C, some which is old enough to reflect radioactive decay (figure 5).
Respiration values similar to the atmosphere in the year of sampling likely reflects the fastest
turnover C that was fixed the same, or the previous year, although it is not possible to rule out a
mixture of older and younger C that matches the atmosphere using the radiocarbon measurement
alone [78].

Steady-state ecosystem C dynamics serve as a null hypothesis against which we can evaluate
the ecosystem and soil respiration radiocarbon time series from our changing permafrost
ecosystem [24,79]. In steady state, ecosystem C storage is constant throughout time with
ecosystem respiration outputs balanced by plant production inputs. The atmospheric decline
of â€”4%o per year (figure 1) represents the theoretical upper limit of decline that should be
observed for ecosystem respiration over time in a steady-state ecosystem. And in fact, the
decline of ecosystem respiration through time should have a somewhat less negative slope,
since autotrophic respiration and fast-cycling C labelled by the current-year atmosphere could be


50-75% (but not 100%) of ecosystem respiration returned back to the atmosphere [22,29,50,80].
The remainder of the return C flux (25-50%) is derived from ecosystem pools with longer C
turnover times [22]. Slow turnover C pools have slower year-to-year changes in radiocarbon
values since new atmospheric C inputs are buffered by older C already contained in the pool
[73,79]. If the atmosphere returned to pre-bomb levels under steady-state conditions, ecosystem
respiration radiocarbon would eventually converge back closer to the atmospheric value given
enough time. In the actual world, where the atmospheric radiocarbon ratio is being continuously
diluted by fossil fuel emissions that is unlikely to happen anytime this century. The future
