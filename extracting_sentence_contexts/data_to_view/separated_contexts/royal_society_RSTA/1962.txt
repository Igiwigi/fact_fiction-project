First, it
was Plana who reacted in 1856 and claimed that Adams was correct and then that he was not,

3Berlin observers, looking for the planet almost two months later, used another chart made by Carl Bremiker in 1845. The
chart lay forgotten in the director’s office, waiting to be distributed together with another still unfinished chart. The fact that
the map was only present in Berlin gave rise to various speculations about the importance of this map for the discovery,
ranging from the idea that Galle and d’Arrest used it from the start of the search to the idea that Le Verrier knew about the
map in the first place. Its absence from Cambridge was often assumed as the crucial reason the planet was not discovered by
Challis [58]. The truth is that the Berlin observers proceeded with the then standard Harding's Sky Atlas and were looking for
a planet based on Le Verrier’s prediction that it would be seen as a disc.
