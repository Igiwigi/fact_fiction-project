duced in the vessels, which nevertheless became loaded with slowly-moving or stagnant
corpusecles; and on one occasion I observed the capillaries of an area which had been
pinched, still transmitting languid streams of blood containing great excess of cor-
puscles several days after the injury had been inflicted, while in the surrounding parts
the circulation continued perfectly healthy. Mechanical violence, like heat, chloroform
and mustard, had effected an alteration in the tissues on which it operated, in conse-
quence of which the blood in their vicinity assumed abnormal characters ; and many
other facts of similar nature might be added, if necessary, to show that this is the
course always followed when accumulation of corpuscles in the yessels is induced by the
action of irritants.

In discussions regarding the causes of the phenomena of inflammation seen in the
trog's web, the great difficulty has hitherto been to account for the puzzling fact, that
while the arteries still retain that state of enlarged calibre which is best adapted for easy
transmission of the blood, its accelerated movement comes to give place to unnatural

* The gradual supervention of the effects of irritation upon the blood may be watched very conveniently
by arranging a piece of lint s0aked in chloroform, 80 that the vapour may play upon the web while the eye
of the observer is over the microscope. If the chloroform be removed when the tendeney to accumulation
of corpuseles exists in a yery slight degree, restoration to health will occur within a few minutes.
