It is clear that the tendency of the short but usually quite regular inferior
temporal sulcus of anthropoids to break up in man in various pieces (either transverse
or longitudinal fissurets) must also be explained along the same lines. Woo.Larp (loc.
cit. IL) showed that the acoustic cortex, especially the relation between the depth of the
supra- and infra-granular layers is less developed in the Australian aboriginal brain, a fact
that fits in very well with the findings of van Noort (1917) in the Madurese and with the
fact that this cytotectonic field is late in phylogeny to acquire its typical characteristics
(BropMANN). As in the second temporal convolution, the temporo-pontine fibres arise ;
pragmatic functions may also act a part here as they do in field 9 of the frontal region. Exxior Sire (1927) has also pointed to the evolutionary importance of the temporal
region in connection with pragmatic functions.
