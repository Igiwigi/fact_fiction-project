without entering into any ſpeculative enquiries relative to their
emote cauſes; and in deſcribing the different appearances I
Ahall make uſe of the moſt familiar terms. Thus, in ſpeaking

Zprobable, that the green matter ads a very important part in
Zthe produQtion of this air in the one- caſe and in the other. But
F- ow it a&tsis not well aſcertained ; and I had in general much
Srather confine myſelf to a ſimple, and even 2a unlearned, de-
S\cription of faCts, than by endeayouring to give more preciſe
Sdefinitions, at firſt, to involve myſelf in all the difficulties
Z'which would attend accounting for phznomena, whoſe cauſes

take care that the facts ſhall be faithfully deſcribed, and I flat-
