By tracing the various operations which would take place-in
the cooling of the hot body, in this imaginary experiment, we
Shall become acquainted with the nature of those which actually
take place, when the cooling of a hot body is prolonged by
means of warm clothing.

From the results of several of the foregoing experiments we
may conclude, that, supposing the thin concentric hollow spheres
in which the hot body is confined to be made of metal, the
cooling will be slower, if the surfaces of these spheres are po-
lished, than if they are unpolished, or blackened : and hence we
might very naturally be led to suspect, (what is probably true
in fact,) that the warmth of any kind of substance used as

clothing, or its power of preventing our bodies from being
cooled by the influence (frigorific radiations) of surrounding
colder bodies, depends very much 01 the polzisb of its surface.

If, with the assistance of a microscope, we examine those
substances which supply us with the warmest coverings, such
for instance as furs, feathers, silk, &c. we shall find their sur-
faces not only smooth, but also very: highly polished ; we hall
