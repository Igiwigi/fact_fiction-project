of its closure, but not during its passage. I now gave the tissue another quarter of an
hour's resb, and then obtained responses to faradisation of a partly rhythmic nature.
Lastly, on waiting for another quarter of an hour—4.e., one hour from the time at
which the persistent stimulation for an hour and a half had ceased—the movements

in response to faradisation were strictly rhythmic, although for the same strength of

current the rate of their rhythm was now slower than before—viz. : 28 per minute.
(But on placing another pair of electrodes on another part of the tissue, the original
rate of 38 per minute could be obtained.) I now again persistently tetanised for an
hour, and throughout that time obtained perfectly regular and sustained rhythm of 28
per minute. Exhaustion had not again supervened when the observation terminated.
(e.) Such being the facts, the question arises as to their interpretation. At first I
was naturally inclined to suppose that the artificial rhythm was due to a periodic

rariation m the strengbh of the s8timulus, caused by some slight breach of contact

between the terminals and the tissue on each contraction of the latter. This snpposi-

tion, of course, would divest the phenomena in question of all physiological meaning,

and I therefore took pains in the first instance to exclude it, This I did in two ways :
first, by observing that in many cases (and especially in Cyanea capillata) the rate of
the rhythm is 80 slow that the contractions do not follow one another till a considerable
interval of total relaxation has intervened ; and second, by placing the terminals
