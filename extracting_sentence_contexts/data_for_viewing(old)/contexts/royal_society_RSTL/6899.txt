MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS AT THE KEW OBSERVATORY. 285

d 4. Diurnal Inequality and Solar-diurnal Variation. Tables IV. and V. p. 284.

The diurnal inequality (which is by no means identical with the slar-diurnal variation
as has been sometimes assumed) has in fact two principal constituents, viz. the solar-
diurnal variation itself, and the disturbance-diurnal variation. It is obtained for each
month by taking the differences between the mean positions of the magnet at each of
the twenty-four hours and the mean position in the month (the latter being the mean of
all the days and all the hours in the month). Tt is the first step in the process of
obtaining in a separate form the several periodical variations from the combination in
which they appear in the photographic records, and includes all the positions tabulated
from the records, without the exception of any. Table TV. (page 284) exhibits the
diurnal inequality in each month, on the average of the five years, from January 1858 to
December 1862 inclusive.

The $0lar-diurnal variation, shown in 'Table V. (page 284), is obtained by a similar
process from the hourly positions in the same period, exclusive of those which differed
