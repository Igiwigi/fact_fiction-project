The Thaliacea as a whole evidently have originated from a single stock, as
evidenced by their peculiar mode of budding from an epicardial outgrowth at the
base of the endostyle. In all three thaliacean families the branchial sac, atrium
and musculature are highly specialized, and are obviously related to the demands
of a free-swimming pelagic life. The gonads are single and lie close to the loop of the intestine, and this fact,
in the absence of positive evidence to the contrary, precludes relationship with the
Paragona (Stolidobranchia). ‘The presence of epicardia excludes close affinity with
the Acoela (Perophoridae), in spite of some resemblance in the methods of budding. At the same time, no structure in the Thaliacea suggests that the viscera have ever
descended a fixation stalk as in the Epicardiocoela (Diazonidae plus Aplouso-
branchia), and the position of the post-branchial gut and thé heart resembles that
in newly metamorphosed individuals of Ciona, Diazona, or Ascidia. ‘This relative
position of gut and heart to the rest of the body is, in fact, extremely primitive. In
young forms the epicardia retain their openings with the pharynx, although the
distal epicardial tissue is specialized for budding and does not form the lining of
the perivisceral cavity as in Ciona.
