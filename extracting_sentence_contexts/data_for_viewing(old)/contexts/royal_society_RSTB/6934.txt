(2) Lining of the micropylar canal, which is continuous above with the outer
cuticle of the integument and below with the inner cuticle of the integument.

(3) Inner cuticle of the integument, which is continuous with the cuticle of the
nucellus below.

(4) Cuticle of the nucellus (only present round the free part of the nucellus)..

(5) The megaspore membrane, a sac of cuticle extending from within the nucellus
to near the base of the seed.

It is a fact readily demonstrated in the seeds of recent gymnosperms that not only
is the outside of the integument cutinized but also the micropylar canal, the inside of
the integument and the outside of the free part of the nucellus. The nucellus cuticle,
however, only extends down to the level where the nucellus unites to the integument,
for there its cutinized epidermis bends outwards and becomes the inner lining of the
integument. In a fossil seed compression we can therefore determine the extent of the
free part of the nucellus by finding how far back its cuticle can be traced: in Beania
gracilis the cuticle and therefore the free part of the nucellus is confined to the top third
of the seed. These layers are now described in detail.

(1) The outer cuticle of the integument is a hard layer of very thick cuticle (total
thickness about 20-30,) which is brittle and usually breaks into fragments. The cells
are isodiametric, the cell walls project inwards to a remarkable extent, usually covering
