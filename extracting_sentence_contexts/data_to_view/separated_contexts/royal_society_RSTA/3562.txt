satisfies this differential equation, the coefficients a,,. and a, must be connected by
the relation

y(n — q)(n-+g+ I+ Gar(¢-o+2)(a+o4 2)=0,
as is seen by substitution. The first coefficient is determined by the fact that it is equal to the value of

a’P,/dy? when p= 1. This quantity is known to be equal to | ‘Bed UR The
