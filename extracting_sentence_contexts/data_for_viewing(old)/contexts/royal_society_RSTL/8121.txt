Elderly skulls. Gravitation changes —It is a well recognized fact that the skull con-
tinues to undergo change of form after adult life is reached. LJAvarER in the general
appearance of the head, and FRomIEP® in the skull, depict the retreat of the forehead
characteristic of old age, but the precise nature of the change and the causes on which
it depends have not been recognized. The changes referred to result entirely from the
operation of mechanical causes, and consist in a yielding of the skull in consequence of
its own weight. Precisely as the apparently solid glacier flows down its valley at a rate
too slow to be appreciated by direct observation, 80 the skull falls gradually down by its
own weight and that of the contained brain. The condyles of the skull are supported
on the vertebral column, and by the process of gradual yielding the basal part of the
$kull is driven in, from the occipital tuberosity behind, to the fronto-nasal suture before.
Thus the postforaminal angle is flattened out, while the angle of the tuberosity and the
orbito-frontal angle are made smaller. At the same time the skull is increased in breadth,
