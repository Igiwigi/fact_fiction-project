* W. K. Parxer (1881, p. 204, pl. 36, fig. 5) described a specimen of B. marinus (= B. agua Latr.) in
which the hyalia have lost their proximal and distal portions. This is probably abnormal, and may be
an effect of old age.

458 E. TREWAVAS ON THE HYOID AND LARYNX OF THE ANURA.

Previous Work on Bufo.

Dueis (1835) dissected Bufo vulgaris and B. calamita, but did not see a constrictor
eaternus (“ hyo-pré-glottique ”), and the fact that he described only one other con-
strictor muscle (“ hyo-post-glottique ”) loses its value since he missed the constrictor
posterior even in Rana esculenta. He knew that only two posterior petrohyoids are
present in Bufo.

HeENuE (1839) gave a good description of the hyoid and larynx of B. palmarum,
and referred also to B. cinereus. In B. palmarum he stated that one of the branches of
the bronchial process meets its fellow in the middle line, and that the bronchus is also
supported dorsally by a paired process from the dorsal part of the cricoid.

W. K. Parker (1881) figured the hyoids of several species of Bufo, which, with the
long rather narrow hyoid plate, the absence of anterior processes of the hyalia, the bent
postero-medial processes with large terminal cartilages, conform to the pattern shown
