slightly the larger, while the values of b/a for H and N also differ but slightly, and
in the same direction in the two cases.

Coming now to the results for Pare St. Maur, we see that the values for “a” are
all in excess of the corresponding values for Kew, but the values of b/a at the two
places are in general closely alike, the difference being sometimes in one direction,
sometimes in the other. The agreement in the values of b/a at the two places is
closest in H and N, and least close in I. The fact that at Pare St. Maur V shows a
slightly larger value of b/a than D is noteworthy.

On the whole, the similarity in the phenomena shown at Kew and Pare St. Maur
is exceedingly satisfactory. The resemblance appears decidedly closer than between
Kew and Wilhelmshaven. This is probably partly due to the fact that the decli-
nations at Pare St. Maur and Kew differ only about 2°.

§ 58. Table XLIV. gives a final set of results from the mean diurnal inequalities
for the year. They were obtained from the individual inequalities for 11 or 10 years
by least squares. The agreement with the results in Table XLIIL is good. This is
satisfactory, if only because it shows that it is possible to obtain by means of the
much simpler method of Table XLIJ, results giving a good approximation to those
found by least squares,
