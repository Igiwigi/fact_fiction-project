The F lines are far
to the violet end and come into the observed region only when weakened by high
order, The F lines are all linked to lines of higher frequency by the 1864 link, also for
m = 4, 6 to lines of lower frequency. The same tendency is shown in F to lower
frequency, any such to higher frequency lead to unobserved regions. This fact is
important as showing that at least here the 1864 separation enters in the link
relation, and not as a direct displacement on the limit. To the F,(%) limit corresponds a 1864 triplet series parallel to that originally
considered. I have been able to follow it up in the same way as the foregoing as far
as m = 26 at least.
