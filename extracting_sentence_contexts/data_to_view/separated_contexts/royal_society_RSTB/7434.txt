In a rounded condition they are
approximately 15 to 30 across. Amoeba glebae, according to Dobell (1914), has a size of
12 to 20. The small size of Dobellâ€™s organism is probably due to the fact that he used rich
nutrient liquid media and uncontrolled bacterial food supply. The species of amoebae
described in the family Schizopyrenidae have been found to be very active in young
culture and are readily able to produce the limax shape. Hartmannella glebae and other
species described in this genus are not very active and rarely produce the limax shape.
