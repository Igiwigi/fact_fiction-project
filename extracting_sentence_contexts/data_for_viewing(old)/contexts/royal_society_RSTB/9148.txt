but are unable to address the spatial and phylogenetic covariance
(see the electronic supplementary material, figures S2 and S3, and
below). The main problem in generating an output from the model
is that a fitted/predicted value is a point estimate and does not
account for the statistical uncertainty in our estimates. To incorpor-
ate uncertainty, after the analysis, we converted our predictions of
IUCN status into probabilities of threat. Previous analyses have
taken a similar approach in the analysis of threat status, but instead
converting the threat to a binary variable before the regression
analysis [17]. This has the disadvantage that information on the
ordinal nature of the IUCN scale is ignored. Our analysis, however,
retained the continuous information in the model fitting: for
example, we account for the fact that a species classified as cat-
egory 5 (Critically Endangered) is more at risk than a species in
category 3 (Vulnerable).

To produce these threat probabilities, we calculated the prob-
ability that each species was threatened or not from the
predictions of IUCN status. This was simply done by calculating
