Thus, even if averaging over some state variables to obtain a
2D force map can provide qualitative information, it can also
hide crucial effects and can even produce a completely mislead-
ing result owing to the strong correlations between the states
variables along the actual trajectories. For instance, averaging
the interaction between two fish (and neglecting the effect of
the wall) over their distance d, to only keep the dependence
on the two angular variables y (viewing angle) and ¢ (heading
difference) in a 2D representation, involves the unknown corre-
lation function Cd, y, ¢) between d, y and @ along the
experimental trajectories. Note that even if the true interactions
were in fact separable into a product of one-variable interaction
functions, 59 = f(d) g(w) h(g), the 2D projection would then be
3H, 6) = g(Wh() x [> Cr, , ) FO) dr. The integral term
(averaging over the distance between the two fish) leads to an
unknown and non-trivial function of y, and ¢, which is in gen-
eral not separable unless the correlation function is itself
separable. And it is not: if two fish are close, they are likely to
be aligned (¢ = 0), whereas if they are far apart, their headings
are much less correlated (¢ nearly uniformly distributed). This
simple example demonstrates that force map projections not
only do not recover the true interaction (g(y) h(@) in this case), but
can artificially produce a non-separable interaction, even if the
actual interaction takes a product form.
