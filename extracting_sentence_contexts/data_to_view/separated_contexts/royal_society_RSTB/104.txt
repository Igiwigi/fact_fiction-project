They were observed by Matrrcui, who seems to have looked on them as of the
nature of Galls,* and TrEvrraNnus regarded them as undeveloped buds, while A. P.
DeECANDOLLE considered them as diseased structures. Since that time very various
ideas have been published with respect to them, and as to their origin and relation to
the roots which bear them. One of the most curious facts about them is that,
although it is very difficult to find a specimen of our ordinary Leguminose (Clover,
Lucerne, Beans, Peas, Vetches, &c.) the roots of which are free from the swellings,
no one has succeeded in showing that they do any injury to the plant: this has been
repeatedly employed as an argument against their being due to the influence of any
parasite. The contrary opinion has gradually gained ground, however, and I am now
in a position to prove conclusively that it is the correct one.
