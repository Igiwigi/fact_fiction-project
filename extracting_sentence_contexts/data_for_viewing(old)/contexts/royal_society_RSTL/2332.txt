posing heat to be material, it is a non-conductor of electricity ; hecause the incor-
poration of a conducting with a non-conducting substance is found to impair the
insulating power of the latter, as in the case of air charged with free yapour ;


INSULATING PROPERTY OF HEAT, 231

whereas, in the intimate union of two non-conductors, the insulating power remains
perfect. Since, then, heat does not impair the insulating power of a given volume of
air, heat, if a 8ubstance, should necessarily have non-conducting properties.

51. The converse of this reasoning furnishes additional evidence in favour of the
above conclusion ; it is a well-known fact, that the excitation of heat in good con-
ductors, such as the metals, is inimical to their conducting power. This result always
ensues in mixing a conducting with a non-conducting substance, and is also evident
in amalgamating a good conducting metal with an inferior one *,

This curious effect of heat in impairing the conducting power of metals, has been
elearly and beautifully illustrated by Sir Humeary Davy 4+. I have also arrived at
similar results #, and find, as stated by him, that heat in any way excited in metallic
conductors, whilst transmitting an electrical current, tends to impair their conducting
power. Mr. Carisw1E, likewise, has observed the same fact, as appears in his last in-
teresting paper on the Laws of Magneto-electric Induction .
