work of extermination appears to have been accomplished ; and there is at present
not a single living example either in the Mauritius, in Rodriguez, or Reunion ;
a few isolated individuals are kept in a state of captivity in the Seychelles, imported
from the island of Aldabra, the only spot in the Indian Ocean where this Chelonian
