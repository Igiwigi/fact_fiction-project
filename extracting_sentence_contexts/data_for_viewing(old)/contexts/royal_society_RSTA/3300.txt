i.e. the process becomes non-Markovian as the transition probabilities at t do not depend only on
t but also on t — fo. This will imply that the transition rate W(C,,, Cy,, t) will become dependent also a
on the time interval fo, ie. W(Cy,Cy,, t, fo). If one considers not only a single time interval to but [=
a number of time intervals, f/ = nto, one should write the transition rate in more general terms. : 8
Formally, equation (2.6) should then be replaced by : —

In equations (3.3), we have taken the integration limits from 0 to t, because we assume that the :3
process begins at t = 0. An alternative extreme possibility which is also often adopted would have :$
been to assume that the process began at t = —oo. Since, in fact, the relaxation times are relatively :
short compared to macroscopic observation times, these different expressions are essentially
equivalent.
The corresponding transition kernels W(C),,Cy,t — t’) and W(Cy, Cy, t — t’) may have different
forms, depending on the various pathways for relaxation to local thermodynamic equilibrium [16,
20]. The simplest exponential form in t — t’,

W(Cni, Cn, t = #) = ty | Wo(Cnir Cn) EXP [-' ‘|,

leads from the master equation (3.3) to the second-order non-Markovian master equation
