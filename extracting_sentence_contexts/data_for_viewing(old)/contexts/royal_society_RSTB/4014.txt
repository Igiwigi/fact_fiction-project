true through four successive generations. When he crossed these with one another
he found that CG. biennis 2 x Gi. muricata $ [F, (BZ) x F, (M2)] gave
@. muricata, and C2. muricata 3 x C8. biennis 3 [F, (M?) x F, (B2)] all gave
2. biennis.

Gotpscumrpr (33) investigated the cytology of these crosses and found a certain
amount of evidence for the conclusion that in the cross G2. muricata 2 x G2. biennis o
the ovule nucleus of G2. muricata undergoes degeneration, its place being taken by
the pollen nucleus of G2. biennis. In the cross U2. biennis 2 x Gi. muricata ft, the
(2. biennis nucleus is said to be destroyed and its place taken by G2. muricata. Thus
the hybrids with G2. muricata cytoplasm have nothing but 2. biennzs chromatin,
while those with U2. biennis cytoplasm have nothing but 2. muricata chromatin.
If confirmed, these facts would fall in line with the elimination described above,
with the difference that in this case the whole of the female portion of the zygote
would be eliminated, instead of a few chromosomes.

We thus have a complete series from cases in which the male pronucleus degenerates
to a condition where the female substance is entirely eliminated :—

1. Echinus 3 x Mytilus ¢ —Kuretwirser (48). The male pronucleus degenerates
and development is carried on by the female pronucleus alone.

2. Arbacia & x Toxopneustes $ —TrENNENT (91). All paternal and some maternal
chromosomes eliminated.
