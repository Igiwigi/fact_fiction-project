pyramid in Egypt [3]. In fact, they had already been used in 1955 by E.P.George in Australia
to determine the ice burden over a tunnel [4]. Over time, it became routine in particle physics
experiments to use them for the commissioning of new particle detectors. Their high average
energy of 3GeV leads to straight tracks in the Earthâ€™s magnetic field and their low flux of about
100 Hzm~? at sea level is not challenging for any data acquisition system, but sufficient to take
some useful data.
