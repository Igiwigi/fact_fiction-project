process is 8een in the Rays, ho. goes on to 8ay, © The first spinal nerve which has the distribution of the hypo-
glozzal of the higher Vertebrata passes out of the spinal canal either between the firs and second yertebrw, or
through the foramen in the arch of the first, in the Amphibia, which have no proper suboccipital nerve, This
is a very curious circumstance, and requires elucidation by the study of development.”

1 cannot help thinking that both the intercalary vertebra, just described, and also the one through or behind
which the hypoglossal or 8uboccipital nerye passes, are both undifferentiated from the occipital arch in the

Tn the presence of such curious facts as the skulls of larval Caducibranchs discloge,
the mind naturally seeks to know what have been the factors in that marvellous modifi-
cation of the axis seen in the 8kull of a Vertebrate animal. I shall reconsider these

things in my © Summary.”
The auditory capsules of the larval Seironota (Plate 29. figs. 1, 2) are thoroughly

chondrified, and well show the form of the enclosed membranous labyrinth, with its
three canals above (fig. 1, 9.8.0., h.8.0., P-8.c.), and the crescentic slit, becoming the
ſenestra ovyalis (fig. 2, f.0.), below.

Mesiad of this oblique rent in the capsule the ragged and imperfect cartilage has
