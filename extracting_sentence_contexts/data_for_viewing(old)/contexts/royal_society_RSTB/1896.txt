She also writes : ‘‘ The whole tooth is formed under the basement membrane, and the entire growth is
from the side of the pulp. The calcification begins at the surface of the tooth, and there is no addition
made outside the part already calcified, no newly-formed layer of enamel appearing as a membrane on
the surface, the tooth receiving additions from the side of the pulp only.”

From the foregoing extracts it will be seen that Miss Nuny discovered the existence of the specialised
layer upon the surface of the dentine papilla of Plagiostomes, and quite correctly ascribed to it the
réle of being the matrix in which their enamel was formed. But, her bias being towards defending the
correctness of the late Professor Huxtky’s view that the enamel cells did not participate in any direct
manner in the formation of the enamel, she appears not to have appreciated that her discovery might
have quite other significance and importance, and she does not seem to have sufficiently recognised the
very essential fact that no corresponding tissue is developed in a Mammalian tooth germ, but argues
as though conclusions drawn from it were fully applicable to all enamels.

For the same reason, perhaps, she did not describe very completely nor adequately the peculiarities

Nor does Rést’s belief that the ameloblasts do nothing more than furnish a
“Schmelzoberhiiutchen ” commend itself as probable.

For were this the case, their development to so great a size, a size which bears a
