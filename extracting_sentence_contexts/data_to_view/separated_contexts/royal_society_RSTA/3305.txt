The wave profile decreases from crest to
trough. Moreover, n, u and P are symmetric with respect to the crest, while v is antisymmetric. In
the absence of stagnation points in the flow, the symmetry of the free surface (visible in all figures
presented in the paper) is guaranteed by the fact that the wave profile is monotonic between crests
and troughs. For irrotational waves the reader will find details in the book by Okamoto & Shoji
[36], while for rotational waves, details are in the article by Constantin et al. [37]. We take the undisturbed water level to be at y=0 in such a way that the mean-zero (wave
elevation) condition

a

is satisfied.
