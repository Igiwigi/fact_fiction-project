While the evaluation of the phenomenological RET structure
proceeds quite differently from the kinetic theory approach—where one has to integrate a
distribution function—it is also quite challenging, and for classical monatomic gases there is
no RET system above the 10 moment case that has the full structure as outlined above. Further
examples, including chemical reactions, radiation and viscoelasticity, can be found in [37]. All RET systems with 13, 14 and more moments discussed, e.g. in [9,38], are, in fact, : =
approximations and do not have the full RET structure. Rather, these approximations are similar, : =
if not identical, to Grad-type moment systems, with the same limitations as these, in particular 1B
only the linearized equations have an entropy, and hyperbolicity is lost for larger deviations from :2
equilibrium states. 8

The equivalence between RET for the ideal gas and maximum entropy closure was never fully : o
exploited to discuss feasibility of the macroscopic approach. For instance, a MaxEnt system with 5 99
13 variables is impossible due to blow up of the distribution function as discussed above.
