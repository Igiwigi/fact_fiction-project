This is readily
seen in the sections but does not show very obviously in the model, as the suture is
inconspicuous. However, in the latter stages the lamina merges imperceptibly into
the cartilage of the pars lateralis, lending support to the contention that the orbito-
sphenoidal cartilage assists in the formation of the superior portion of the occipital
ring. Specialattention might be drawn to the fact that in Perameles the coalescence
of these cartilages synchronises with the roofing over of the foramen magnum. In the presphenoidal region the ala orbitalis sends down towards the mid-ventral
line a thin cartilaginous flap, the processus orbitonasalis (proc.o.n., figs. 4 and 5),
In this foetus, head length 6 mm., the flap is very fragile and does not reach the
base of the skull. In Stage IV, head length 11-0 mm., however, it is much stronger
and joins the cranial keel (figs. 12 and 13); in this way it completes a foramen in
the wall of the skull.
