Salome
(v. 7.3.0) was mainly used to build the geometry of the different models, and ParaView (v. 4.1.0)
to display some of the images.

(b) Flow domain

The real flow domain is a catheter along with the lateral ventricle in which the catheter is
placed. However, our goal is just to compute the flow rate distribution and shear stress in a
neighbourhood of the VC walls, so the influence that the geometry and volume of the ventricle
might have on the results is negligible. In view of this fact, the lateral ventricle was modelled
as a cylinder (figure 1) to facilitate the task of meshing and thus improving the accuracy and
computational efficiency. The cylinder is 75mm long and its diameter is 16mm. The inner
diameter and outer diameter of the catheter are 1.5mm and 2.5mm, respectively, and the part
of the catheter inside the cylinder has a length of 60mm.
