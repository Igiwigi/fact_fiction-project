2. Iconicity impacts linguistic processes: metaphor and
anaphora

(a) Iconic constraints on metaphorical extensions

Taub [3] proposed the analogue-building model of linguistic iconicity to account
for how iconic forms are created in both signed and spoken languages (although
we will focus here on signed language iconicity). Taub [3] observed that the
resemblance between a form and its meaning is not an objective fact, but is a pro-
duct of the cognitive processes of the individual who makes the comparison.
Similarly, Wilcox [7] argued that ‘Iconicity is not a relation between the objective
properties of a situation and the objective properties of the articulators. Rather,
the iconic relation is between construals of real-world scenes and construals of
form’ (p. 123). Taub [3] proposed that the cognitive process of comparison is
key to understanding iconicity and that comparing two entities crucially involves
creating structured correspondences between them. Figure 1 provides a diagram
