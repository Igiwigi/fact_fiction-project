fish bones held together by mucus, was found in the cavity of
the gizzard.

In the cormorant, (Pelecanus Carbo), the situation of
the solvent glands is the same as in the -Soland goose, but
they only form two circular spots, one anterior, the, other
posterior,* *

In all these birds, the inner membrane. of the gizzard- is
soft and smooth, but that portion which, covers the solvent
glands, has a more spongy or villous appearance; and this
part is found to'secrete a mucus which the other parts do not.
This fact appears to be ascertained. by the following circum-
stances: on examining the gizzard of a cormorant that, died
in consequence of an inflammation in the cesophagus, which
had been communicated to. the internal membrane of the
gizzard, a viscid mucus was, found upon the surface covering
the solvent glands, and this was not met with in any other part,
80 that the mucus had been evidently secreted there, and was
afterwards coagulated by the liquor of the solvent glands
poured upon it, coagulation being the first process which takes
place in the act of digestion. This explains the circumstance
of ascarides being frequently found enveloped in mucus in
this part of the cormorant's gizzard, the. mucus on which
they feed being secreted in consequence of the irritation they
