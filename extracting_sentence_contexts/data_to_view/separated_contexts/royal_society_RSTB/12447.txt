In (b), incorporation is achieved through microinjection of cells into the blastocoel of early blastocysts, followed by implantation and analysis of
the conceptus, typically at embryonic day (E) 9.5. In this assay, contribution is based on expression of a fluorescent reporter in the placenta. These are difficult experiments, often
hindered by the fact that the placenta is highly autofluorescent, and often it is not straightforward to distinguish between placenta and the yolk sac, which is an ICM derivative. These analyses should be accompanied by a stringent analysis through sections and molecular analysis of markers from the trophoblastic derivatives of the placenta. scRNAseq,
single cell RNA sequencing, In (c), cell culture strategies are shown. In (c), as suggested by Baker and Pera [53], the ability of a single cell to give rise to stem cells from the three
lineages of the mature blastocyst is depicted.
