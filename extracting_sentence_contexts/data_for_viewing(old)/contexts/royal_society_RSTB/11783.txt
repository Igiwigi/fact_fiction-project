from more than 80 individuals working in over a dozen countries.

The computer code defining the model is spread across sub-projects that
each defines specific aspects of the organism, such as cellular ion channels or
motor behaviours. Each of these spatial and conceptual scales is typically mod-
elled independently, with multi-scale integration being a long-term goal of the
project. These scales vary in spatial extent (nanometre to millimetre) and in
level of abstraction (tracking of ion concentrations versus body wall dynamics).
Each sub-project is organized as a public repository on GitHub, a web-based
software development platform that serves as the de facto location for collabora-
tive, open-source software projects, including those defining biological models.
Each sub-project also has distinct success criteria, which all have in common a
goal of reproducing empirical stylized facts associated with a biological
subsystem using biologically inspired dynamical models.

In practice, formalizing these success criteria requires producing a checklist of
experimental observations and then assessing how well a single model can
reproduce them when simulated with the appropriate parameters and stimulus
conditions. Here we implicitly assume that the ability to reproduce experimen-
tal results is an indicator of model fitness, and that models which reproduce
more such results are, ceteris paribus, superior to those that reproduce fewer.
