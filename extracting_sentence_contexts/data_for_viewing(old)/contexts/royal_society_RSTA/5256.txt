(i) Multiplicative noise

Equations (1.6) and (1.7) represent only the mean-field behaviour flowing from the microscopic
model. The complete picture must include the noise sources induced in the coarse-grained
dynamics by the stochastic part of the microscopic dynamics, as discussed in [19,23]. The noise
in (1.6) is the divergence of a random current with covariance of order p(Q + 1/2), where | is the
unit tensor, while that in (1.7), rewritten as an equation for Q, is of order 1/p. Crucially, p and
Q in the foregoing refer to the local, instantaneous values of the fields in question. Such density-
dependent multiplicative noise is a generic consequence [31] of the central limit theorem together
with the fact that p and Q are, respectively, the density of an extensive quantity and the local
expression of an intensive quantity. Stochastic PDE treatments of dynamic critical phenomena
at equilibrium [32] implicitly ignore such field dependence, presumably because it is irrelevant


there. In active matter, where density fluctuations are large across an entire phase rather than just
at phase boundaries, it could well have more serious consequences [23], but we will not explore
this issue further in this paper. In §2, we will present results from a numerical solution of (1.6)
and (1.7), mainly without noise sources.

(ii) Proliferation of topological defects

Topological defects in active nematics pose puzzles that are still to be resolved—and that,
