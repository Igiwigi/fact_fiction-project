Waloff & Rainey (1951) found that
the calculated, instantaneous air speeds of a number of Desert Locusts flying at 3 to 12 m.
above the ground (see p. 205), varied little, despite wide variations of wind speed. This
leaves the question open, for it was only locusts flying closer to the ground which gave the
impression, to the writer, of adjusting their air speed in relation to short-term changes of
wind speed (p. 177). Further observations are needed both in the field and in the laboratory
to see how far locusts do in fact regulate their ground speed in the way suggested. The inverse relation between wind strength on the one hand and the height and frequency
of flight on the other (p. 178) has often been referred to in the literature: by Koeppen
(1870: Locusta), Kiinckel d’Herculais (quoted by de Lépiney, 1928, 1933: Schistocerca), Regnier
(1931: Schistocerca), Zimin (1934: Calliptamus) and Zolotarevsky (1929: Locusta), and the
present observations provide some quantitative evidence on the point. It is over the relation between flight directions and the wind that there has been the most
confusion in the literature.
