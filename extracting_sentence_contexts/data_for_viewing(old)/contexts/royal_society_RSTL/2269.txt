face, the effect diminishes rapidly with every remove of the
screen from the heated body.* This fact which he has
established both by experiment and reasoning, is an infallible
test for the opacity or transparency of all kinds of screens.
Hence in the preceding experiment, the effect was not pro-
duced by heat radiating from the posterior surface of the
screen, but by heat actually radiating through the screen in
the same manner as light radiates through water, or other

transparent fluids.
