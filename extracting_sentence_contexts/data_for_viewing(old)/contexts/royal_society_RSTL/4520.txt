odic and iodic acids decompose one another, and it is my opinion that in the change

whatever be that comhining relation which subsists between the oxygen and hydrogen,
that same relation muzt also be between the particles of the iodine itself. What is
commonly called the affinity of hydrogen for oxygen is not sufficient to account for
this change, for hydrogen alone will not decompose the iodic acid, unless it be in the
nascent condition, When hydrochloric acid is the decomposing body, chloride of
iodine is formed, when hydriodic acid, the iodine itself. Are we not to admit that
these two substances are formed according to the same law? To this synthesis of
the iodine, the division of the element which takes place at the formation of the
bydriodic and iodic acids, is the correlative fact, to explain which we must assume
the same polar difference between its particles (see page 765).

2. In the course of his researches on the hypophosphites, Wurz discovered a very
singular substance, the bydruret of copper*, This substance is formed by the action
of hypophosphorons acid upon copper salts. It readily decomposes, $0 that it is not
easy to determine its constitution, but his analyses very closely corresponded with
the formula Cu, IH. That this is truly the formula of the substance, may be inferred
with yet more certainty than from the analyses, from the following curious reaction.

* Bunzerivs attempted to throw gome doubt upon the existence of this body, but the correctness of the
facts, as stated by Wurz, is guaranteed, not only by the well-known 8kill and ability of this chemist, but also
