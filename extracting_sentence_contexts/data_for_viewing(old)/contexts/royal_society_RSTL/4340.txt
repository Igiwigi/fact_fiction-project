31. The tentacles of the fringe of Rhizostoma and Cephea have already been de-
scribed, fig. 13. The tentacles which beset the generative membrane closely resemble
them, and consist of a single membrane, containing many small thread-cells, Idoth
of an inch in diameter. Their cavity is filled with a homogeneous substance, some-
times containing nuclei, similar to those of the dise (15.); the inner membrane takes
no part in their formation, fig. 30.

32. The marginal tentacles of Thaumantias are very similar (fig. 3) to the buccal
tentacles of Mesonema ; they consist of an outer membrane, in which numbers of
thread-cells are imbedded, and an inner axis composed of clear cells arranged end to
end; they have a peculiarity, which has been already pointed out by Prof. E. Forses,
in being placed aboye the marginal vesicles instead of being alternate with them, as
in the nearly allied genus Geryonia; and from this fact, and from their totally differ-
ent structure, I believe that they have a totally different origin. In Geryonia the
tentacles belong to the second classâ€”are processes of the circular canal; in Thau-
mantias they are simple processes of the outer foundation membrane, 4. e. of the suh-
stance of the disc. Perhaps this difference in structure among the tentacles may
turn out to be a good means of generic distinction among other members of the
class.

33. As to the second class of tentacles. Such are the marginal tentacles of Me-
sonema, of Geryonia (Wir), of Oceania and of Medusa aurita (EnrenBeR6); the
tentacles of the under surface of Phacellophora, and the interbrachial tentacles of
Cephea.
