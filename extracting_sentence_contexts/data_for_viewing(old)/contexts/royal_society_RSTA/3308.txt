of Blanksby et al. [138] The authors used CCSD(T)/AVDZ//B3LYP/6-31G* to report a value of
108.1 kJ mo! ~1 for the isomerization barrier of C4 Xe ) into 1-C43Byg). Suffice to add that the
rhombic lA, structure is 11.7 kJ mol~! more stable than C4 xs) at their level of theory [138].

In contrast to the triplet ground-state surface, the isomerization between rhombic and linear
forms on the singlet PES occurs in a stepwise manner (figures 11 and 14). Starting from the
TAs global minimum, the system attains an intermediate C; monocyclic ring [d-C4C-A’)] via a
ring-opening (barrierless) process in which only a single peripheral bond is broken. Indeed, d-
C4(1A’) shows itself as a local minimum on the singlet ground-state PES and lies about 111.7 and
122.2kJ mol~! above the r-Ca(1Ag) structure at the CASDC/CBS-8 and ve-CASDC/CBS levels
of theory, respectively. As we shall see, the discrepancies between full-valence and truncated-
space correlation approaches are generally smaller for the singlet than the triplet states. This stems
from a higher multi-configurational character of the latter [141]. In fact, because the isomerization
process in the singlet PES occurs in a stepwise manner, reactants and products are somewhat
similar in nature, thus allowing for some error compensation in the ab initio calculations.

The ORC path for interconversion of r-C4(tAg) and d-C,(!A’) is depicted in figure 14a. The
salient feature relates to the appearance of a small barrier at « = 151.5° in the CAS(8,12)/AVTZ
optimized curve. Indeed, such a geometry corresponds to a C2, capped triangle (dd-C4(+A1) in
table 7) which was first identified by Whiteside et al. [129]. At the CAS(8,12)/ AVTZ level, this form
represents a transition state with an imaginary frequency of only 238.0icm7!. A close inspection
of figure 14a reveals that dd-C4(1A}) is responsible for the degenerate isomerization between
symmetrically equivalent d-C4(!A’) structures (one with a = 130.8°, the other a = 173.6°). The
isomerization barrier is only 3.2kJ mol”! at this level. However, as first noted by Mass6 et al.
