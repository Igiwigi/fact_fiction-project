Given that no well-defined crack tip exists, the
notional crack tip is assumed to coincide with the point ahead of the traction-free crack at which
the tensile stress normal to the crack plane is equal to the local tensile strength of. The FPZ lies
between the traction-free crack tip and the notional crack tip and this FPZ is often called a fictitious
crack. Within the fictitious crack, the cohesive stress ofp, and the opening of the crack faces w are
related by the Ofpz, — W curve (figure 2d). The response of material points lying outside of the FPZ is governed by the applicable o — «
behaviour of the bulk material. Only if the FPZ is very small with regard to the specimen size is
the one-parameter Griffith LEFM theory applicable.
