and since 0 >argn 7, these are located somewhat as in figure 7. It follows that, in

displacing C to S(7—y) (which cuts the real axis at an angle of 45°) no poles are captured.
On the other hand, a branch-point may be crossed, and certainly is in the case of interest
when 7 is small (or nearly equal to 7; unless otherwise stated we assume without loss of
generality that y< $7). Strictly, therefore, an integral round the corresponding branch-cut

should be included: however, we follow the standard practice and neglect this contribution,
a procedure which is justified either by the fact that 2 has an appreciable imaginary part, or,
when this is not the case, by the fact that || >1 (Ott 1942). Equation (12) may therefore

It is now permissible to put z — 0 in that part of the integrand which is ‘slowly varying’ in
the vicinity of the saddle-point. When +0, the only factor of p’{sin (y—2)} to which this
may not be applicable is that containing the pole at y +%,. Hence
