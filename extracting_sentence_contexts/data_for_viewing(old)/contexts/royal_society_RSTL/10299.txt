it is therefore perfectly possible that the appendage which is usually called the third
maxilliped of Lucifer may really be the first pereioped. I think the probability is in
favour of the accepted homology, but the use of the term © third maxilliped ” in the
present paper for the appendage in question must not be regarded as evidence that
the homology is accepted without question.

The pereiopods.

At the end of the Zo#a series four pairs of pereiopods, the first, second, third,
and fourth, are represented by buds (figs. 43 and 45), while the fifth is entirely absent,
as DANA pointed out in the © Report on the Crustacea collected by the United States
Exploring Expedition,” p. 634, WiLLEM6Es-SUBM (Proc. Roy. Soc., vol. 24, p. 134),
calls attention to the 8ame fact : the total absence of this somite ab all stages of
development. In the Schizopod stage each of these appendages is biramous (fig. 59),
and similar to the last maxilliped, although the first three pairs (fig. 59, Pr. 1, Pr. 2,
and Pr. 3) are longer.

At the end of the Schizopod series of stages the entire fourth pair and the exopo-
dites of the other three pairs disappear, and the endopodites lengthen to form the
long slender limbs of the adult (fig. 61, Pr. 1, Pr. 2, and Pr. 3). They are four-
Jointed, with a double row of short hairs along the anterior edge, and the first is only
half as long as the second and third, which are nearly equal, and almost as long
as the carapace and neck. The third ends in a short, curved hairy claw, too small
to be shown in the figure.
