In germination the hard seed-coat is opened by the separation of a little lid or cap at 1
point opposite the radicle, and from the orifice thus formed emerges the sprouting struc- 1
tures of the young plant. In the accounts generally given, it is stated that the cotyledons
remain in the seed, and the radicle and plumule emerge together, the latter elongating i
into a kind of stalk between the cotyledons and the first leaf. I cannot reconcile this
account with the facts which I have met with. The cotyledons certainly remain within |
the seed-coats, and, as it appeared to me, s800n undergo decompoxsition ; but IT believe
that, in addition to this, the first leaf of the plumule (the larger of the two lobes visible
in the embryo (fig. 21 F') previously to germination) also remains within the seed-coats.
