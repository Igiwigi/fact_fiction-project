What this law really is, I do not pretend to have determined
with that degree of precision which I wished ; but the experi-
ments of which I am about to give an account will, I think,
demonstrate in the most satisfactory manner, not only that the
force of fired gunpowder is in fact much greater than has been
imagined, but also that its. force consists principally in the
temporary action of a fluid not permanently elastic, and con-
sequently that all the theories hitherto proposed for the eluci-
dation of this subject, must be essentially erroneous. The first step towards acquiring knowledge is undoubtedly
that which leads us to a discovery of the falsehood of received
opinions. To a diligent inquirer every common operation,
performed in the usual course of practice, is an experiment,
from which he endeavours to discover some new fact, or to
confirm the result of former inquiries. Having been engaged many years: in the investigation of
the force of gunpowder, I occasionally found many oppor-
tunities of observing, under. a variety of circumstances, the
various effects produced by its explosion ; and as/a long habit
of meditating upon this subject rendered every thing relating

to it highly interesting to me; I seized these opportunities with
avidity, and examined all the various phenomena with steady
and indefatigable attention. During a cruise which I made as a volunteer in the Victory,
with the British fleet, under the command of my late worthy
friend Sir CHARLEs HaRDy, in the year 1779, I had many op-
portunities of attending to the firing of heavy cannon : for
though we were not fortunate enough to come to a general
action with the enemy, as is well known, yet, as the men
were frequently exercised at the great guns, and in firing at
marks, and as some of my friends in the fleet, then captains,
(since made admirals) as the Honourable Keirn STEWART,
who commanded the Berwick of 74 guns—Sir CHARLES
DoveLas, who commanded the Duke of 98 guns—and Ad-
miral MacBR1DE, who was then captain of the Bienfaisant of
64, guns, were kind enough, at my request, to make a number
of experiments, and particularly by firing a greater number of
bullets at once from their heavy guns than ever had been
done before, and observing the distances at which they fell in
the sea; I had opportunities of making several very interest-
ing observations, which gave me much new light relative to
the action of fired gunpowder.
