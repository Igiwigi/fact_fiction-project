It follows that the only solution which contributes to F is that corresponding to the
value

a
$ = a =—.

In this case we have
{{. (U'u, + m'v, + n'w,) d= = — {[. 2 as ie 8 ss ed)

It is now necessary to consider at some length the contribution of the special solutions
to F. This part of the work is complicated by the fact that the functions R,” (cos 6)
become infinite when 6 = 0.

Consider first the contribution of these solutions to i{, lu, d=. Corresponding to

the value
== CA ieee ae ne . . (8.50)
we have, making use of (6.43),
eae oC + us
= C," + us.

The integral of the harmonic term always vanishes, since the integral with respect
to w is zero. It also vanishes by reason of its order of magnitude ifn > 1.
