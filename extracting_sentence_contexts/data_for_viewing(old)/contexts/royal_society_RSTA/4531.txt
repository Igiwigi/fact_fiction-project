thinking may bias people towards anticipating outcomes that are less severe. As a consequence,
people may perceive the problem as less serious and show less support for mitigative action. On
the other hand, expressing the outcome as certain (albeit with an uncertain time of arrival) may
prevent this optimistic bias because it forces people to focus on a particular outcome, removing
the opportunity for wishful thinking.

This result is consistent with construal level theory [20], which states that the level at which
an idea is construed influences people’s evaluations and preferences. Specifically, projections
expressing an outcome as certain may be processed at a lower level of abstraction, decreasing the
psychological distance between the individual and the event, and leading individuals to respond
more strongly (compared to projections expressing an outcome as uncertain).

A potential limitation that should be addressed is the fact that the projections in the two
uncertainty conditions were imbalanced in a number of ways. First, the projections in the outcome
uncertain condition included the mean projected outcome in addition to the upper and lower
bounds of the confidence interval, whereas the projections in the time-uncertain condition did
not include the mean projected year of arrival. Thus, more information was presented in the
outcome-uncertain condition than in the time-uncertain condition. One might therefore argue
that the effect of the experimental manipulation can be explained by differences in the amount of
information that the projections contained. However, this explanation seems unlikely given that
increasing the amount of information should strengthen rather than weaker people’s responses
to the projections.

Second, many of the projections in the outcome uncertain condition were presented in
both metric and imperial terms (temperature rise in degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit, sea-
