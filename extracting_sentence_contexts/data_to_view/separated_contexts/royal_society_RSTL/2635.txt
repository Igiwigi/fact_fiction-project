EXPERIMENTAL EXAMINATION OF THE INDICATIONS OF THE PROOF PLANE. 451

angle a, the particles are differently cireumstanced, and have one or two sides free. Resting, therefore, on the previous fact, that the capacity of a conducting body, con-
sidered as a whole, and upon which we accumulate electricity, is affected by this
cireumstance, we might be led to conclude that the proof plate of small thickness
should actually receive more electricity at the angle @ than at the centre c, it being
there less exposed to the opposing forces, whatever they be, which tend to contravene
the induction. Now if we extend the thickness of the proof plane P, we place the
distant points more without the influence of these forces; hence its inductive capa-
city becomes more perfect, s0 that when the thickness or other extension is suffi-
ciently great to render the inductive capacity the same at the centre c as at the
angle a, then the quantity of electricity abstracted is also the same, as is found by
experiment (36.) (41.)
