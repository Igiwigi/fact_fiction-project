With the face in repose there is no sign of facial paralysis (Plate 7, fig. 13).

The shoulder is at normal level, and there is no atrophy of the upper part of the
trapezius or of the sterno-mastoid of the left side. Turning the head, so as to put
the right sterno-mastoid into action, produces no association movement in the face,
but causing strong innervation of the sterno-mastoid by causing forcible action of it
against much resistance produces a very slight muscular action on the angle of the
mouth, but the eyelids or other parts are in no way affected.

Raising the shoulder, when done with moderate force, produces practically no sign
in the face (Plate 7, fig. 9), but forcible and sudden elevation against resistance
produces association movement of the face, affecting the eyelids, the brow, and the
angle of the mouth—in fact, all the muscles, but these are only maintained while the
resistance is kept up, and pass off, although the shoulder is kept elevated.

The following is the condition as to voluntary co-ordinated movements independent
of the association movements.

The Brow.—This is the most defective part, and only very slight control over the
frontalis and corrugator can be made so as very slightly to wrinkle the brow.

The Eyelids.—These are able to» be brought together completely so as to shut
the eye completely, and, indeed, with some degree of tightness. The winking is
present synchronously with that of the other eye.
