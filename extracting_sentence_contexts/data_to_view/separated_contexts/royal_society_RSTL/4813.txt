The more elevated portions cf the glacier, which during a
large portion of the year are exposed to a mean temperature under 32%, moye in a
manner comparatively uniform, the lower extremities undergo great oscillations in
their speed (in the ratio of four or five to one; see page 185); hence the atte-
nuation during the summer regime which is owing to the drag taking place down-
wards in an excessive degree ; but the winter's cold, equalizing in some measure the
velocity everywhere, brings the plasticity into full action, fills the crevasses and
swells the surface to its old level. As it is universally admitted that the glacier proper does not grow in thick-
ness by snowy accumulations, the important variations in its level in different years+
cannot be ascribed to the severity of certain seasons increasing the mass of snow
falling upon it, but rather to the prolongation of the winter cold into spring and
summer, which causes the condensing or accumulating process to be in excess, and
therefore the thickness of the plastic mass to accumulate beyond its due amount. Thus we have the following phenomena, all independently observed, reconciled
and explained by one hypothesis; the general convexity of the crevasses upwards,
notwithstanding the excess of motion in the centre; the general verticality of the
crevasses, notwithstanding the retardation of the bottom ; the perfect state of the
crevasses every spring succeeding their visible collapse in autumn; the ascertained
velocity of different parts of the glacier, and the diversity of the annual changes which
these velocities present ; the seemingly opposed facts showing the glacier to be sub-
Jected to powerful tension, producing crevasses, and yet to be under a compression
which produces in some places the frontal dip; and finally, the renewal of the level
of the ice during winter, which has been lost partly by superficial melting, but as
much or more 80 by the attenuation and collapse of the glacier during summer. These various effects of one cause, though they do not embrace all the phenomena of
glaciers, certainly include a very remarkable and complicated group of facts. * Travels, p. 386, 2nd edit.
