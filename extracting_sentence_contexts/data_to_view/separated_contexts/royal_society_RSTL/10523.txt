The force exerted on a molecule
y its neighbours must no doubt be, on the whole, attractive, and if the film is thin
nough the surface tension musb diminish. Tb is, however, usual, in dealing with other
roblems in molecular mechanics, to assume the existence of repulsiye forces acting at
All events between certain limits as to distance. We need only refer to the well-
Znown instance of some forms of the dynamical theory of gases, and to the fact that

e most recent theory of the nature of matter lately put forward by Professor
= pn RevyxoLDst leads to the conclusion that the force between two molecules
Syhich approach each other is alternately attractive and repulsive. Tf 8uch an alternation really takes place the surface tension of a thinning film will
-Alternately increase and diminish, This is clearly pointed out by MAXWELL in his
Article on © Capillary Action” (* Eneyel. Brit.'), in which he says :—* The force between
She particle and the liquid is certainly on the whole attractive, but if between any two
Small values of c [the distance of a particle from the surface] it should be repulsive then
Sor films whose thickness lies between these values the tension will increase as the

hickness diminishes, but for all other cases the tension will diminish as the thickness
Aliminishes.”
DS It appears, therefore, that a critical value of the surface tension is nob inconsistent
With received views as to the nature of the forces in play between the particles of a
iquid, and if it existed it would produce phenomena similar to those observed at the
edge of a black film.
