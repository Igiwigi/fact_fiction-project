By mere
exposure to them in their uncondensed state, my fingers be-
came sore beneath the nails, and they produced a most painful
sensation, which lasted for some hours, when they came in
contact with the eyes. The phenomena of the Voltaic electrization of fAluoric acid,
present no evidences in favour of its containing a peculiar
combustible substance and oxygen; and the most simple
mode of explaining them, is by supposing the fluoric acid, like


in different chemical Prosesses on Fluor Spar. 279

muriatic acid, composed of hydrogen, and a substance, as yet
unknown, in a separate form, possessed, like oxygen and chlo-
rine, of the negative electrical energy, and hence determined
to the poxitive surface, and strongly attracted by metallic sub-
stances. This view is much more conformable to the general order
of chemical and electrical facts than the third hypothesis, just
now mentioned. It is indeed possible to conceive, if the metals be regarded
as compounds of hydrogen, that the hydrogen may be pro-
duced from the metal, positively electrified at the time that
the acid combines with its supposed basis, and that this hydro-
gen may be transferred to the negative surface ; but this sup-
position involves a multitude of others ; and the results of the
electrization of fluoric acid are analogous to most of the results
of the electrization of water and muriatic acid, both of which are
shewn by analysis and synthesis to be compounds of hydro-
gen; and in the electrical decomposition of these bodies, their
characteristic element is generally combined with the positive
metallic surface. In the Bakerian Lecture for 1810, I have given an account
of the action of potassium upon pure silica.
