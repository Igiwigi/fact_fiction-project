Z 145. The edge is a facultative line counting 3 times; this will appear from the dis-
Eussion of the reciprocal surface. Therefore g=0'=3; t=1.

5 ZWXZ+YZ—3X*—37)=0,
Sbreaking up into Z=0, the oscular biplane, and into a cubic surface (itself a surface
EXI=12—B)). The complete intersection with the cubic surface is made up of the line
&X=0, Z=0 (the edge) six times, and of a residual sextic (=3 conics), which is the
spinode curve; &=6.
The equations of the sextic are in fact XZ+Y*=0, X*+Z*=0, 80 that this consists
of three conics, each in a plane passing through the edge.
The edge touches each of the three conics at the point X=0, Z=0, Y=0; but it
must be reckoned as a single tangent of the spinode curve, and then counting it three
times, Þ'=3.
