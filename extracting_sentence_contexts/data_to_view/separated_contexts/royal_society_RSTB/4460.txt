SCHMIDT ON THE BREEDING PLACES OF THE EEL. 181

a country where eel fishing is a specially important industry, was accorded the task of
prosecuting the investigations farther, and it fell to my lot to take charge of the
work. ;

T had little idea, at the time, of the extraordinary difficulties which the task was to
present, both in regard to procuring the most necessary observations and in respect
of their interpretation. Our work on these eel investigations has now extended some
16 or 17 years, with a lengthy interruption occasioned by the recent War. The task
was found to grow in extent, year by year, to a degree we had never dreamed of ; in
fact, we have been obliged, in order to procure the necessary survey material, to make
cruises of investigation ranging from America to Egypt, from Iceland to the Canary
Islands. And this work has been handicapped throughout by lack of suitable vessels
and equipment, and by shortage of funds ; indeed, had it not been for the private
support afforded from numerous different sources, we should have had to relinquish
the task long since. I propose now to give a brief survey of the results attained.
