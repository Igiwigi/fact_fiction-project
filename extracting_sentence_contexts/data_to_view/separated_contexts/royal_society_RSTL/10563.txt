A few simple experiments sufficed
to 8how that all the results obtained with gaseous jets may also be obtained with liquid
jets, and in a more marked and satisfactory way. As even the lightest known liquid has a very high density compared with air, we
should naturally not expect liquid jets to exhibit the same sensitiveness to gound that
gaseous jets do. Nor do they in fact ; while to purely mechanical disturbances they
