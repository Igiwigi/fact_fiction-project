This entails a more prominent proliferation of cells from the blind end of the proctodzeum. In other words, the development of the proctodzeum coming so soon after the beginning
of the development of the posterior endoderm mass, the formative area of the posterior
endoderm rudiment is carried inwards to the end of the proctodwum. It is this fact
which I believe had led many insect embryologists to the conclusion that the midgut is
ectodermal in origin. To this point I shall refer later. â€˜The development of the mid-gut
from this region is from now onwards very similar to that already related concerning the
growth from the anterior end.
