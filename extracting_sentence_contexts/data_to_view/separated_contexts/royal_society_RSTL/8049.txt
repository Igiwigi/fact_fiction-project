But it may be asked, How
omes it, that in dead muscular fibres, especially if they have been placed in alcohol and
Szubsequently mounted in Canada balsam or dammar-varnish, even though apparently
fully extended, we 80 often observe broad alternating stripes of anisotropous and
Ssotropous substance ? To this I would answer that, although these fibres are not,
Actually shortened, yet the elements composing them have tended to asnme the con-
Alition that ordinarily accompanies contraction of the fibre (see below). And this
-Spinion is fully confirmed by Brtcxr's statementf, that the isotropous disks are always
:Sroadest in such fibres as have been prevented from shortening at the time of death.
t is, in fact, as if we took a fibre that had become fixed at death in the contracted
tate and mechanically stretched it out to its original length; in which case we may
Feadily conceive the anisotropous and isotropous disks which are present in that state of
he fibre to be equally stretched out. S

2 And here I am tempted to offer a conjecture respecting the probable changes which
take place during the contraction of muscle in the disposition of the structures which I
Have endeavoured to describe.

= It is conceivable that the anisotropous ground-substance is the true contractile part of
the fibre, and that it is allied in nature to ordinary protoplasm, but without the
granular character commonly met with in the latter}. The muscle-rods may be
Simagined to be composed of a labile, and at the same time elastic substance of semifluid
Aconsistence, possessed of considerable refracting power on light, and in all probability

devoid of vital contractility.
