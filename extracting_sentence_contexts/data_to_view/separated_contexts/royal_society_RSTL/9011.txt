Strychnia.—In my former paper I confined my remarks with reference to
strychnia to the effects of this poison on a species of coyered-eyed Medusa. It seems
desirable, therefore, to supplement these remarks with a few additional ones regarding
the effects of this poison on the naked-eyed Medusze. In the case of Sarsia the symp-
toms of strychnia-poisoning are not well marked, from the fact that in this species con-
vulsions always take the form of locomotor contractions. The symptoms, however, are
in some respects anomalous. They are as follows :—First of all the swimming-motions
become considerably accelerated, periods of quiescence intervening between abnormally
active bouts of swimming.
