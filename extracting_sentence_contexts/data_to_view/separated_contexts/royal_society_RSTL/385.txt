The preceding observyations are offered as mere conjecture;
and I am fully sensible of what little consideration should be
attached to. them : they are not however' entirely devoid of
probability. An hypothesis is below the dignity of a system
which is founded on the indestructible basis of experiment :
and even though it be supported by the coincidence of ad-
mitted facts, by direct analogies, and by the correspondence
of received opinions, it should nevyertheless be the: beginning
and not the end of knowledge.
