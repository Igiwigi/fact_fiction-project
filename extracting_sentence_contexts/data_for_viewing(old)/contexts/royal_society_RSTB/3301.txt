Some of the features which we regard as supporting this view have already been
mentioned, but we will now briefly consider the morphology of the reproductive
shoots as a test of the primitive character of the Araucariez.

In a monograph on the male flowers of Gymnosperms, TurBout* states that those
of Araucaries exhibit points in common with the flowers of Cycads. In the structure
of the sporophylls and in the arrangement of the vascular tissue Turnout considers
that the Araucarie, more than any other Conifers, resemble the Cycadacese, But
we are disposed to take the view that the male flowers of Cycads and Conifers are
not constructed on a sufficiently similar plan to render easy a close comparison. The
microsporangia of the former exhibit features which bring them fairly close to the
sori of ferns, a fact brought out by Warmine, TrevB, Lane} and other botanists
and confirmed by the recent investigations of Wr1eLaNnp{ into the male flowers
of Bennettites. In the Conifer, on the other hand, the sporophylls belong to
a distinct category ; the great majority of genera have stamens of a fairly uniform
pattern, but Agathis and Araucaria stand apart in having long, free and more
numerous microsporangia recalling the sporangia of Lquisetum. The male strobilus
of the Araucariez, at least that of Araucaria, is characterised also by its large Size
and greater similarity in this respect to the female shoot, and in the gradual transition
from foliage leaves to sporophylls.

We do not wish to lay undue stress on the external resemblance of the male flowers
in some species of Araucaria (e.g., A. Bidwillii) to the strobili of certain existing
Lycopods and to the Paleozoic Lepidostrobi; but can we recognise resemblances of
