The variations in the respiratory phenomena in the working day were 80 small, that at
2, 4,5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 o'clock r.x., on July 6, all the quantities were almost identical
with those at 7 on the following morning. The maximum and minimum quantities of
carbonic acid were 6:52 grs. and 7:44 grs. ; of air inspired, 399 cubic inches and 341
cubic inches; rate of respiration 12 and 10-2, and rate of pulsation 71 and 58 per minute
—quantities which contrast in a remarkable manner with those previously shown to
occur with food. In Plate XXXII1. fig. 1, the variations with and without food are con-
trasted.

Hence there is great uniformity in the respiratory phenomena during a long fast ; but
it was noticeable that on the occasions when the carbonic acid would have increased with
food, there was a slight decrease without food—a fact corresponding with that which T
recorded in the Transactions of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society for 1856, in
the rate of the functions on five persons of different sexes and ages. A low and uniform
state of system is therefore the characteristic condition in a prolonged fast; and it is
very like that which occurs with food at the end of the interval between the meals. It
has also been shown that in a fast of this duration the quantity of carbonic acid does
not progressively diminish, but is the same at the end of twenty-seven hours as it was
at the end of 44 hours.

There is therefore a state of the system which is nearly uniform under all the circum»
stances of the day, when the body is uninfluenced by exertion or the primary proces8es
of digestion, and which may be called the basal or normal state. From this but little
can be taken away; and the additions must be due to exertion or the temporary influ-
