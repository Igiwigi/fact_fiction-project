The year 2002 heralded a breakthrough in antimatter research when the first low energy
antihydrogen atoms were produced. Antimatter has inspired both science and fiction
writers for many years, but detailed studies have until now eluded science. Antimatter
is notoriously difficult to study as it does not readily occur in nature, even though our
current understanding of the laws of physics have us expecting that it should make up
half of the universe. The pursuit of cold antihydrogen is driven by a desire to solve this
profound mystery. This paper will motivate the current effort to make cold antihydrogen,
explain how antihydrogen is currently made, and how and why we are attempting to trap
it. It will also discuss what kind of measurements are planned to gain new insights into
the unexplained asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the universe.
