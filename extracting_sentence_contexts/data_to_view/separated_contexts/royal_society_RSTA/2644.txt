The motion is without expansion and irrotational except for z = Z, : this follows from
the fact that wu — i is an analytic function of z for any point z between the planes
y= + db except z= %. (ii) The circulation in a circuit surrounding z, is x: this is seen from the fact that for
such a circuit

(iii) v = 0 for» = + 6: this follows from the fact that in general
