In the preceding part of the paper the analyses of the nitroprussides led to the
extremely complicated formula Fe, C,, N;; O, R;. This formula was @ priori very
improbable, and naturally led to the belief that an error in the estimation of the
carbon forced its adoption. In fact, if 25 instead of 24 equivs. of carbon were pre-
sent, the formula would resolve itself into the much simpler expression Fe, C,, Ng O Rz. It is therefore important to review the evidence, in order to see whether the simple pro-
portion of iron to carbon, 1 :5, might be derived from it. The following table exhibits
the proportion of iron and carbon found in the analyses of the respective salts :â€”
