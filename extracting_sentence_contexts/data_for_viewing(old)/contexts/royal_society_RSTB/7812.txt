lengthy history of the opinions that have been held about them. Langerhans himself was
in no doubt that the cells he described occupied a superficial position in the epidermal
strata; Masson, like many others, agreed with this opinion and, following Merkel, suggested
that they are effete melanocytes passing through the epidermal strata in course of desqua-
mation. In their earlier studies the present authors (Billingham 1948; Billingham &
Medawar 1948) used Gairns’s (1930) variant of gold chloride impregnation, a technique
which, in spite of the very great clarity with which it reveals the fine dendritic processes
(figure 16, plate 10), has the drawback that branched cells are seen to advantage only in
squash preparations of the epidermis peeled away from the impregnated preparation.
The use of such preparations, combined with the fact that after treatment with the
strongly acid solutions required by this technique the epidermis does not usually cleave
away at the dermo-epidermal interface, led to the erroneous conclusion that the cells of
Langerhans occur in the basal layer. The present account corrects and supersedes our
earlier interpretation.

Branched cells may be seen in the anatomically intact epidermis of split skin, whether
pigmented or not, by treatment with Cohnheim’s gold impregnation technique as follows.

The epidermis is split from the dermis and gummed upon coverslips. It is rinsed briefly
in distilled water and immersed in a 0°5 °{ aqueous solution of yellow gold chloride until the
whole preparation becomes pale yellow in colour. It is then washed for a few minutes in dis-
tilled water and allowed to undergo a slow ‘natural’ reduction by immersion in a vessel con-
