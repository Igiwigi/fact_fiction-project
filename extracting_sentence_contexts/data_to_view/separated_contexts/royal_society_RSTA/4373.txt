A modestly sized one processes 75 000
barrels of heavy oil in its fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) bed. For this purpose, approximately
5000 tonnes of the La+-exchanged zeolite Y cracking catalyst are cycled between the actual
‘cracking’ reactor and the regenerator per 24h. This fact alone tells us that there is an urgent
need to find new (catalytic) ‘game-changing’ ways of converting CO? to useful materials. An important fact, commented upon at the Discussion Meeting, is that there is, at present, no
large source of readily available Hz. Were H2 plentifully available, the Fischer-Tropsch process
alone could be responsible for the production of a large selection of alkanes, alkenes and alkanols.
