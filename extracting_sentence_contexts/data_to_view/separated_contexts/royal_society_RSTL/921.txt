This spectrum I viewed through
the crystal, and of course saw it doubled; but the two images
were by no means parallel; the unusual one inclined to the red,
and its violet was considerably farther removed from. the violet
of the other, than the two reds were from one another; which
shews, that the most refrangible or least flexible rays were
farthest moved from their course by the unusual action, and
proves this to be very different from flexion.*

From all these observations this conclusion follows; that
the remarkable phaznomenon in question arises from an action
very different from either refraction or flexion; and whose na-
ture well deserves to be farther considered. It may possibly
belong to the particles of Iceland crystal, and in a degree to
those of rock crystal, from. the form and angles of the rhom-

these bodies wants the property: for we cannot mould theparticles
of glass, we can only shape large masses of these; whereas we

cannot doubt that in crystallization the smallest masses assume
the-same form with the largest: but then other hypotheses
may perhaps also account for the fact, such as atmospheres,
electric fluid, &c. &c.; $0 that till farther observations are made
we ought to rest contented with barely suggesting the query. In the mean time, reserving to a future opportunity 'some in-
quiries concerning the chemical properties of light, and the
nature' of the forces which bodies exert on it internally, I con-
clude at present with a short summary of propositions.
