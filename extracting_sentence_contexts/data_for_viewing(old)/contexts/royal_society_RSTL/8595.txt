On the Habits of Land-Planarians.

Land-Planarians are probably all of them nocturnal in habit. DArwix (oc. cit. p. 249)
remarks on the avoidance of light by Geoplana, and Dr. Lzipy (loc. cit. 2, p. 172) observed
Hhynehodemus sytvaticus to be a nocturnal animal crawling about on fences at night.
Geoplana subterranea (Geobia, DizsIxG), according to F. Mijiuen, lives underground in
the holes of Lumbricus corethrurus (Halle Abh. toc. cit. pp. 26, 27). The Ceylon Land-
Planarians appear to ayoid light in the same manner as the Geoplane; they are to be
found in dark places, such as under large fallen leaves, and in confinement they coil
themselyes up away from the light.

'This avoidance of light appears to be common to nearly all Planarians, and not con-
fined to terrestrial forms, Max Scnvurze (loc. cit. 1, p. 17) refers to the fact that
aquatic Planarians always choose the darkest 'side of any vessel in which they may
be placed to rest upon; and I have myself obseryed this fact in the case of Planaria
torva and Dendrocelum lacteum. Green chlorophyl-containing Planarians, such as Meso-
Stomum viridatum, form an exception to the general rule, since, as Max Scuuutzu informs
us (706. cit. 1, p. 17), they always place themselves on the light side of a vessel: they
nevertheless die when exposed to direct sunlight. Tt may have been due to the fact
that T did not give them sufficient phade that all my attempts to keep the Ceylon Land-

Planarians alive in confinement failed. I never preserved them for more than a fey days.
