unit of Y.

Let %, G be the valuation rings of F, G, with maximal ideals 3, Q respectively, considered
in Schmidt’s example. G is defined to be the set of elements of 8 whose images in G belong

to 6—G is a discrete valuation ring of rank 2. The contracted valuation ring R = Gn
is also discrete, of rank 2; in fact, R is the set of elements of Y whose images in F belong to

Any valuation ring 6’ of L lying over ® has rank 2, and is therefore contained in a rank
valuation ring 8’ of L; the image of G’ in the residue field of 8’ is a valuation ring ©
and @’ consists of all elements of 8’ whose images in the residue field belong to ©’. Thi
valuation ring 8’ K can be none other than %. By the preceding remarks, B’ = §.
It follows that G’ is a valuation ring of G lying over §, whence G’ = G. Thus S’ = S;
is the only valuation ring of L lying over ®; and consequently G is integrally dependen
on ®.

The image in G of the maximal ideal q of G is the maximal ideal Q of G. Since Q = uG
it follows that q = uG; similarly, the maximal ideal of R is p= wR. Hence q = pS.
