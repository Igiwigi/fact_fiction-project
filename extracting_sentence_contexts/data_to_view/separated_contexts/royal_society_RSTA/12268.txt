A. McAULAY ON THE MATHEMATICAL

the principal term in B’ should be poH’. It is needless to say that this will not in
general be the case if B involves D, In fact, in a steady field, the only conditions we
should be able to assert that B imposed upon the field would be those which resulted
from equations (17), (18), which do not contain pyH’ at all.

85. The conclusion we are bound to come to is that on the present theory there
must be no term in 7 which will result in yV/ containing D. Thus the thermo-
magnetic effects must be left to the theory of irreversibility.
