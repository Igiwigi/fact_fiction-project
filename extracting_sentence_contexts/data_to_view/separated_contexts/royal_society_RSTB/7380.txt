Since all these systems have very similar divergences
they differ from one another practically only in their plastochrone ratios. But whereas the
magnitude of the divergence angle, i.e. its proximity to 137-5°, immediately conveys the
knowledge that a Fibonacci system is under consideration, the accompanying plastochrone
ratio, in itself, does not with equal facility indicate to the mind the position of the system
under consideration in the Fibonacci scale. In fact, of course, that position is fixed by it,
and, as may be seen from figure 2 or from the first two columns of table 1, as the plasto-
chrone ratio falls towards unity the parastichy system most nearly orthogonal changes,
or rises, from one characterized by low Fibonacci numbers through those with higher and
higher pairs of these numbers. TABLE |

A simple and useful transformation to bridge this mental gap is suggested by the almost
uniform spacing of the curves drawn in figure 2. Since the double logarithms of the plasto-
chrone ratios found in any two successive and high orthogonal Fibonacci systems differ by
0:41798, i.e. logy +4), multiplication of the entries in column 8 of table 1 by 2°3925,
the reciprocal of 0-41798, must result in a series of numbers almost in arithmetical progres-
sion with a common difference of unity.
