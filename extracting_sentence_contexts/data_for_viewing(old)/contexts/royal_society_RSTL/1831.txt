to them, were immersed in the extreme cells of a battery of thirty, four-inch
plates; metallic contact between the copper plates and the ends of the battery
being, carefully avoided. The connexion being made with the cups of the gal-
yanometer, the deflecting force was found to be equal to 90 degrees of torsion
of the glass thread. The copper plates were then immersed in the extreme
cells of the same battery, containing one hundred and twenty pair of plates,
when it was found that the degrees of torsion were somewhat less than 180.
Hence the electro-magnetic effects of the two batteries were nearly as the
Square root of the number of plates. Hence the electro-magnetic effects of two
batteries are within certain limits proportional to the quantities of water de-
composed.

18. These principles will enable us to account for a fact in electro-magnetism
which has never been explained in a satisfactory manner. Since the discoveries
in electro-magnetism, it was obseryed that no increase of electro-magnetic
power is gained by increasing the number of plates in a battery, when the
extreme plates were connected by metallic contact with the ends of the battery.
This unexpected result has been accounted for by supposing that voltaic electri-
city, having tension like common electricity, acts feebly on a magnetic needle.
Not feeling satisfied with this vague explanation, I had again recourse to ex-
periment.

Exy. VII. Having soldered copper wires to several plates in a common gal-
vanic trough, I connected a single pair with the galvanometer, and observed
the deflecting: force. By connecting the extreme plate and the others in suc-
