On the other hand, a common way to distinguish mere
predictions from explanations is to distinguish between
mere correlations and causation. In particular, many philoso-
phical accounts of scientific explanation of physical facts rely
on the directionality of the causal relation (from cause to
effect but not vice versa) to account for the directionality of
explanation and to distinguish mere prediction from expla-
nation.’ Once we allow non-causal network explanations of
physical facts we face the difficulty of distinguishing explana-
tory from non-explanatory network model applications in
some way that allows us to recover the distinction between
mere prediction and explanation. Craver [6, p. 707] stresses
this challenge (taking it to push against recognizing network
explanations as a type of non-causal explanation).”

The problem of directionality and the puzzle of correlational

networks signal that, at least in many cases, the explanatory

power of network models derives from their ability to represent
