intact. But though as regards discoverable symptoms the case was negative, the micro.
scopical investigation of the brain revealed facts of great importance both as regards
the anatomical relations and probable physiological significance of the prefrontal:
cerebral regions. b

The sections demonstrate the occurrence of secondary degeneration or sclerosis of
certain fibres of the internal capsule and crura cerebri. These occupy the lowermost, -
and mos internal aspect of the transverse sections of the internal capsule, and the
most median bundles of the foot of the crus cerebri. The further destination of these
bundles, whether they end in the corpora quadrigemina or in the pons, was not deter-
mined, But the facts demonstrated show that the prefrontal regions are anatomically
in connexion with the median bundles of the foot of the crus and corresponding fibres
of the internal capsule.
