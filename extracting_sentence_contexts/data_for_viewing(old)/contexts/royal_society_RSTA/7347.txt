with negative rotation: these looped paths are like Lanchester’s looping phugoids
but inverted.

There are also paths entirely different in character: for these n does not exist at all.

When L<2 we obtain similar results.

The special case K > 0, or k = —s’k,,,, is interesting. Equations (8-4) now reduce
to
du’ -
q a =—sin#, wu’ =cosf, (8-10)

and we always get either a straight line, or a semicircular path. The fact that we get,
for this value of K, singular solutions is associated with the range of validity of the
approximation for any value of K.

9. (c) x negligible, ty of order —2 or larger; neutral phugoids. If x is negligible, the
term xw’ in the third equation of motion (3-1) can be discarded in comparison with the
term sq’. We are thus left with the approximate equation
