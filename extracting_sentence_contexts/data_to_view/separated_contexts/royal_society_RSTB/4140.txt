20° C., viz., 0°57 mm. per hour. Owing to the difficulties of obtaining a constant
temperature lower than 15° C. in Egypt we have no long series of data on this point,
but it may be illustrated by the fact that we regularly employed a Hearson cold
incubator adjusted to 12°C, for inhibiting further development of germinated seed
which was waiting to be sown, and such seed would remain in the incubator for
24 hours without appreciable growth. In other words, the “minimum temperature” for growth of cotton is probably
nearer 10° C, than zero, as is the case with another Egyptian summer crop, viz.
maize, and it is not improbable that a similar relation holds good for the absorption
of water by the root-hairs. The Effect of Sowing-Date upon Water Absorption.
