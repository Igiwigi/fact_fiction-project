If the foregoing theory is correct the
corpuscles ought to escape from the alkali metals at a much lower temperature than

from metals which are low down in the volta series. In fact, assuming (1) that the
difference in the discontinuity of potential at a platinum vacuum and sodium vacuum
surface is equal to the contact difference of potential for sodium and platinum (taken
roughly to be equal to two volts), (2) that the value of the discontinuity (4°1 volts)
previously obtained for platinum is correct, (3) that the concentration of the
corpuscles for sodium is of the same order of magnitude as for copper, and (4) the
correctness of the present theory, a preliminary calculation showed that currents of
the order of some 10~° ampére per square centimetre ought to be obtained at as low
a temperature as 500° C. The problem we have to face in the case of sodium is not quite the same as in the
case of non-volatile substances such as carbon and platinum. For in this case the
metal has an appreciable vapour pressure at the temperature at which the experi-
ments are carried out, and part of the conductivity present is doubtless due to the
spontaneous ionisation of the metal vapour.
