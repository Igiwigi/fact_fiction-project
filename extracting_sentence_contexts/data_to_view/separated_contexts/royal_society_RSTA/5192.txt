Here is found a feature which was first remarked, we
believe, by Dr. Joun Hopkinson, namely, that in magnetizing from the neutral state
the curve crosses the rising limb of the cyclic curve. The same feature has been
looked for, and always found, in many other curve-tracer tests. This crossing is in agreement with the fact already noticed, that the extremity of
one cyclic curve projects beyond the rising limb of a higher cycle. For, after a piece
has been put through the process of “demagnetizing by reversals,” the magnetizing
curve starting from zero passes, as nearly as we can judge, through the projecting
extremities of the cycles. Hence it lies outside of the upper part of the rising limb
of any cyclic curve.
