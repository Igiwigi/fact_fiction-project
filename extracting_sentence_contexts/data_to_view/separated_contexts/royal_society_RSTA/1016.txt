Figure 4a,b demonstrates the
dimensionless supersaturation as a function of time for bovine and porcine insulin. As is easily
seen, the theory is in good agreement with experiments. Small deviations between theoretical
curves and experimental dependencies can be explained, for example, by the fact that the shape
of both the bovine and porcine insulin crystals differs from spheres. So, insulin crystals can take
the shape of cubes, dodecahedrons and rhombohedrons [54]. Therefore, with a more rigorous


study of the growth dynamics of insulin crystals, their real non-spherical growth shape must be
taken into account.
