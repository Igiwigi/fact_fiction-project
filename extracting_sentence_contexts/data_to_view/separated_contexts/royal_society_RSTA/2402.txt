Since, with x’ being any one of the independent variables x; inside P,,,1, we have P;, = f Pry dx’,
that is P, is the marginal of P,,,;, Markov processes are completely characterized once P is
known as Qi); = P2/P}. This is not the case for non-Markov processes for which it is necessary to
find all Qijs = Ps41/Ps for all s. This fact is in general true except for certain linear non-Markov
systems, for example the class of linear Gaussian processes discussed below, for which it is
possible to determine any P,. At the level of the Langevin equation, the distinction between Markov and non-Markov
systems can be explained pictorially with figure 1, where we display two hypothetical systems,
a Markov and a non-Markov one, whose state variable x are prepared localized at x =5xo. At
time t = s, both systems are observed for the first time at location x = xo indicated by the spatial
coincidence of all sampled trajectories at time f = s.
