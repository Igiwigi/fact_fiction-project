Plate 64, fig. 3). At this time nothing was understood of the part played by these
cells in fertilization. The tip of the pollen tube was supposed to remain always
closed ; thus, Hormerstsr (2, p. 418), after stating that the tip of the pollen tube of
Pinus silvestris often appears to be open and its contents discharged into the cavity
of the corpusculum, adds: “ This is plainly the result of mechanical rupture.”

In an earlier paper (1) Hormeister had observed a pit at the apex of the pollen
tube in certain Abietines. This pit he figures in Pinus Lari (Larix europea D.C.),
but remarks that it seems always to be closed by the primary wall of the tube.

SrrasBurGER in 1869 (4) pointed out that certain errors had crept into
Hormetster’s description of fertilization of the Abietines, errors which were largely
due to the fact that HormuisrEr examined his sections in water. STRASBURGER also
used fresh material, but mounted his sections in white of egg. He came to the
conclusion that Hormxisrer’s cells and nuclei in the corpusculum were nothing more
than granular masses produced in the cytoplasm by the disorganising action of water.
All that he could see of the process of fertilization was a kind of cloudiness passing
from the top to the bottom of the oosphere. At the base of the egg, a granular mass
appeared, in which, later on, a clear spot, the fertilized nucleus, became visible, and
then underwent division. STRASBURGER understood that the contents of the tube
passed over into the oosphere, though he did not see the generative cells ; he also
observed the pit at the apex of the pollen tube.

Three years later, SrrAsBuRGER (5) carried our knowledge of the phenomena of
fertilization in the Abietinese to a much higher level. He was enabled to do so by
