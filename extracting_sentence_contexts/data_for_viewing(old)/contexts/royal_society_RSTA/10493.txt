Il. The Equilibrium of Corpuseles near a Plane Surface of Hot Metal of
Infinite Extent.

§ 4. Both this problem and the corresponding problem in spheres are of consider-
able importance, not only in connection with experiments in vacuum tubes, but also
with regard to the behaviour of hot celestial bodies in space. For instance, the
aurora borealis and allied phenomena indieate that large quantities of ions continually
reach the earth from some extraneous source, while certain variations of the earth’s
magnetic field and other meteorological phenomena seem to be intimately connected
with events which take place at the surface of the sun. The present paper does not
attempt to solve these questions, but the above facts indicate that the subject of the
ionisation produced by hot bodies is not without importance in regard to meteorology.

The problem under consideration may be specified in the following terms :—Given
an infinite quantity of hot metal bounded on one side by a plane surface of infinite
extent which is maintained at a given potential, find the charge on unit area of the
metal surface and the potential at any point in the space outside the metal when the
steady state has been attained.

Let us take the surface of separation perpendicular to the axis of x, and let
the suffix 1 refer to points inside the metal, the suffix 2 referring to points in the
