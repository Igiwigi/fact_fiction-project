These results, taken in conjunction with those found for liquids and solutions,
show conclusively that the thermal conductivity of a mixture is not a linear function
of its composition. The observed conductivity is always less than that calculated
from the linear law, and, on the other hand, greater than that calculated on the
assumption that the resistivity is a linear function of the composition. The
second assumption is, however, a closer approximation to the observed facts than
the former. Since neither of these simple assumptions seems capable of representing the facts,
which, by their uniformity, appear, notwithstanding, to point to some general law of
mixtures, it seemed advisable to calculate the conductivity of a model of a mixture
built up in some simple way so as to lend itself readily to the process. Suppose a cubic centimetre of some substance, having a conductivity po, to be
divided by equidistant planes parallel to its faces, into 1000 small cubes of 1 millim.
edge ; and let small cubes of the same size but of a material of conductivity p be
substituted for » of the cubes of the cubic centimetre chosen at random.
