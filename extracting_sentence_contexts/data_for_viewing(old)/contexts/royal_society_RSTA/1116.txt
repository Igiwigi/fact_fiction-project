The likelihood function p(Y|@) for the reduced and full models is the same, which enables

equations (2.7) and (2.8) to be linked as follows:

p|Y) (2.7)

p@|Y)= (2.8)

POO)

Next, to find the evidence of the reduced model, both sides of equation (2.9) are integrated
over the parameter space. Using the fact that f p( | Y)d@ = 1, the model evidence for the reduced
model is as follows:

p(6|Y)=p|Y) (2.9)

Equations (2.9) and (2.10) have analytic solutions given Gaussian forms for prior and posterior
densities, meaning that the coupling parameters and evidence for reduced models can be derived
from those of the full model in milliseconds, on a typical desktop computer [58]. This speed is
leveraged in DCM for automatically discovering an optimal coupling structure for a network. In
this setting, a greedy search is used, which iteratively generates candidate reduced models with
