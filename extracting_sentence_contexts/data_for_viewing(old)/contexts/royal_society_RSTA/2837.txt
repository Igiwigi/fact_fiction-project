This proves the claim, since, Moa =f. a

Consider now a integrable two-sided magnetic billiard having a pair of integrals 61, 62. We
introduce the mapping £; : 2; > Qj, which assigns to (x, v) the centre of the Larmor circle passing


through (x, v) with a given orientation. Moreover, for the function ; we define the function F; :
Qi, > Rby the rule

F,o Lj = Qj.

It then follows from Theorem 1.2 of [19] that the functions F; are, in fact, polynomials.
Moreover, as @; are integrals of the two-sided billiard, we have

Fy(P1) =F2(Q2) and F(P2) = Fi(Qi). (5.4)

Remark 5.8. It follows from (5.4) that we may assume without loss of generality that F) = F2 =:
F. As one can pass in (5.4) to (Fy + Fo).

We get from (5.4) a remarkable equation on the polynomial functions F:
Fs — r]y(s) + RJ (8) = FZ4 — r] (8) — tReJ7(S))- (6.5)

In particular for « = 0, we get
F(z4) =F(z_). (5.6)
