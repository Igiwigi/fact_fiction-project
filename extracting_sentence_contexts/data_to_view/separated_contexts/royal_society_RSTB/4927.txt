We have a series of experiments to determine the season
when the response is greatest, which will not be complete for another year, but there
are already indications by the appearance of the over-growth that the response is
directly related to cambial activity. Thus vigour of growth may provide conditions
favourable to wounding and the production of resin canals, but the direct responsibility
does not rest here. Since, then, neither food supply nor vigour of growth can, as such, be directly con-
nected as the causal factor with the production of resin canals, theories based on such
accessories only distract attention from the main issue and prevent a proper interpreta-
tion of the facts. With such misconceptions cleared away, we may now turn to a more
detailed study of wounding and its results in Picea.
