It might therefore as well be asserted
that the tides meet at St. Helens, Portsmouth Harbour, or
Hurst Castle, as at Dungeness ; but the fact is, that the pha-
nomena which appear at these different places, are produced
by the same cause producing similar effects, with only the dif-
ference occasioned by local circumstances in the time and man-
ner; and this cause is the accumulation of the water brought
forward by the tide ; an accumulation which is occasioned by
there not being a sufficient space for its discharge, in conse-
quence of the contraction of the channel at the particular
places where these phznomena are exhibited. There is in fact a meeting of the tides, on a small scale,
within the Wight; for the tide of ebb from Southampton River
meets the tide of flood from the Needles, at the sand called
Bramble (which has probably been originally formed by
their meeting) ; from this they flow to Spithead, and meet


between Fairleigh and the North Foreland. 299

the tide of ebb from Portsmouth Harbour, at the sand called
the Spit (perhaps also formed originally by their meeting
there), and causing an eddy tide, which would deposit such
sand, mud, &c. &c. as the current of the tide brings along
with it: nor do'I think it at all improbable that the Long
Sand, at which I have stated the meeting of the tides through
the Downs and from the North Sea to take place, has been
likewise formed by the deposit of such things as the opposing
tides brought with them, to the place where they met. Being employed on the expedition against Walcheren, the
laborious and difficult duty of passing the transports through
the Slough passage into the West Scheldt devolved upon me,
and afforded me an opportunity of observing another pecu-
liarity of the tides in that place. The: Slough passage lies between Walcheren and South
Beveland, communicating with the West Scheldt and the
Veer Gat. | From its junction with the last channel, the tide
flows through several different channels between the islands,
to the northward of South Beveland.
