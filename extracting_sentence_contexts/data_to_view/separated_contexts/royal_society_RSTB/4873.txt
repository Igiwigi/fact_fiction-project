In the following points Experiment 2 agreed with Experiment 1 :—

(1) Within the first 48 hours of the experiment there was a rise in the volume of

circulating blood.

(2) The initial change in the hemoglobinometer readings indicated a dilution of the
blood in the first phase.

(3) Subsequently the hemoglobin value rose.

(4) The maximal values for the blood volume and oxygen capacity were on the
second day. The Experiment 2 differed from Experiment 1 in the following particulars :—

(1) It lasted a day longer.

(2) In this experiment the determinations by the Hartridge method were done
independently by two observers, using different instruments. These agreed to about
| per cent. saturation, an error which means 4-5 per cent. in the “blood volume.”
While therefore the results of other methods are less reliable in Experiment 2 than in
Experiment 1, those of the Hartridge method are more so.

(8) There was no evidence of increased formation of red blood cells as evidenced by
the reticulated counts, a fact which may have to do with the fall in blood volume on
the third day.

(4) On the third day there was a drop in the ‘“ blood volume.” It was then by the
Hartridge method (the only one which gave concordant results) about 1 litre in excess
of that at the commencement of the experiment.

(5) The experiment proved a greater strain than the subject could sustain, as he
became ill and had to take to bed for two days on its termination. We would like to
take this opportunity of thanking him for his help in what proved to be a very
exacting experiment. Tasue IV.
