The larger masses were nucleated, but the smaller were
said to be devoid of a nucleus. It was conjectured that these bodies are in some
way concerned with reproduction. ;

In the following year, 1880, Munrer-Cuatmas (24) stated as the result of the
investigations of four fossil species of Nummulites and two of the allied genus Asszlina,
his conclusion that these species were dimorphic, and that probably the phenomenon
of dimorphism was general. This conclusion was based on the fact that Nummulites
occurring in the same strata, and having identical external characters, fall into two
groups. These differ from one another, first, in the size of the whole disc ; second in
the size of the central chamber. On breaking them open it is found that the small
ones have a large central chamber, and the large ones a small central chamber.
