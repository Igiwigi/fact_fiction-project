periment was made on an extensive scale.

I had six vessels with tadpoles, three exposed to the light in different degrees of
temperature, and three from which the light was excluded.

At the first I was led to think the absence of light was even favourable to deve-
lopment, but I afterwards found that the difference depended on a light increase of
temperature owing to the vessel being covered. This fact is rendered obvious by the
Plate, in which the temperature and absence of light are fully illustrated.

Nottingham,
February 5, 1850.

P.S. I made these experiments in 1848; they were repeated in the year 1849 with
Similar results.
