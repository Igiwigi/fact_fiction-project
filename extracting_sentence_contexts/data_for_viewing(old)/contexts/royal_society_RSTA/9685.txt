Ba may be filled by another radio-active substance. An attempt has been made to
allot the S and D series of Eu and Ra and the result is given in Appendix IL In
response to suggestions made to me in respect of Part I., I have ventured to give in a
second appendix lists of the 8 and P series lines of the elements considered in the
present communication,

The type of formula used here and in Part I. has been employed by MoGEnporrr
in a still earlier paper read before the Royal Society of Amsterdam in November,
1906. He there showed that the formula reproduces the lines of Li, Na, Zn, and Tl in
the different series with great exactness, and stated that he had also obtained
corresponding formule for other elements.

The fact that the series depends in some way on the atomic volume of the element
has been pointed out by Rerycanum.t He showed that if the atomic volumes of the
2nd group of elements be divided by 4, and those of the 3rd by 6, and if the

logarithms of these modified atomic volumes and of the limits of the S series be
plotted, then, with the exception of Zn and In, the corresponding points lie roughly
on a straight line.
