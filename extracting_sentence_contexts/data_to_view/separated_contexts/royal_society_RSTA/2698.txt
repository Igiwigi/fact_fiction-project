In that context, we argue that loss of : o
invariance in the temporal domain of a force field causes loss of invariance in the spatial domain : >
of a corresponding physical quantity and vice-versa. For example, potential energy of a body is 73
transformed into change in momentum when the symmetry of the potential energy surface is a
:N

locally broken by some external agent. These observations converge towards our novel discovery
of the fact that in Maxwellâ€™s equations on radiation, the globally conserved Noether current is
generated as a consequence of localized symmetry breaking of an electromagnetic field. At a
global level, it plays a critical role in defining the global symmetries expressed through gauge
invariance and generation of electromagnetic radiation. According to Maxwell, radiation is generated due to acceleration of electrons [15,16].
