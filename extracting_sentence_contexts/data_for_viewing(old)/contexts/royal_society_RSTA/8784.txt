of pressure in nebule, \\4471, 4388, should therefore be the two most prominent
Helium lines of the Diffuse series. This is a well-known fact of observation in
astrophysics.

We may now take up the consideration of the effect of a trace of Hydrogen.
Inspection of the table is almost sufficient to show that the energy-transfer to longer

wave-lengths found in Diffuse Helium is repeated in the corresponding series of
Parhelium. For \4922 is reduced from 65 to 5'3. 24388 is even more reduced from
4°5 to 3°5, and \4144 from 1‘1 to 0’°7. In fact each is reduced relatively to all its
predecessors in the series. We are in this case dealing with a phenomenon of a
different type to that caused by variation of pressure, and as suggested in connection
with Diffuse Helium, we prefer to restrict the term “ energy-transfer” to cases in
which the change of intensity of a line is greater than, or less than, the change in all
its predecessors in the series.

The effect of a large admixture of Hydrogen is again, as in Helium, directly
contrary to the effect of a small trace just discussed. There is an actual enhancement
‘of the members of higher term number in the series.

There remains the necessity of verifying the fact that the Sharp series of Parhelium
presents no exceptional features, and of observing from a consideration of Hydrogen
