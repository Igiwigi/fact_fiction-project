but this is offset by the energy gain in magnetizing the sample,
E! = —moM-H=—pox rH’. (8.3)

Summing these contributions and allowing the magnetic charge density to
fluctuate along with the field, we find a free energy functional for field fluctuations,

F(H(r)) = | Male)? + MP iy -H)? dr. (8.4)

This functional is entirely equivalent to that for electric field fluctuations in an
electrolyte and in fact is equivalent to Debye-Hiickel theory [49]. Thus, we see
that by suppressing spin fluctuations (i.e. setting H(r) = x7 M()) we recover the
Debye~Hiickel approximation of Castelnovo et al. [17].

Introducing the Fourier transformed field H(r)= V7! >, H(a) e4™ and

substituting into equation (8.4), we find

where V is the volume and we have used D/k = Bh and the fact that the field,
