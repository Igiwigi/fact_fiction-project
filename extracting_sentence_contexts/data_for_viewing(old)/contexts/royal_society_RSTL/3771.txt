aggregate capacity of the arteries being greatly inferior to that of the veins, but a
yascular arrangement equivalent to a double valve. The capillaries of the tubes form
a first great cul-de-sac, those of the Malpighian tufts a second, for these may both
be described as great reservoirs, easily entered from the side of the arteries, but dis-
charging themselves with great difficulty back again, or towards the arterial tree.
If it be now considered that the network of the tubes, or the former and far the
greater of these reservoirs, almost always retains much blood after death, and that
the Malpighian reseryoir is never without a considerable quantity, it will not be
difficult to comprehend, why injection thrown into the veins reaches not to the Mal-
pighian bodies, however well it may seem to load the capillaries of the tubes; for
all the blood must first pass through the difficult channels that have been spoken of,
and this it never can do completely. I suppose that this view of the subject, which
is nothing more than a statement of facts, will be deemed a sufficient explanation,
and that it will not be regarded as necessary to imagine the existence of real valves
in any part of the course of these small blood-vessels. I have never met with any
appearance that could lend credibility to such a supposition, which, if true, would
present an unique structure in the vascular system. Extravasation from the veins
will sometimes reach the tubes, in consequence of a structure which will presently
be explained.

By the Tubes, the Malpighian bodies cannot be injected, nor, without extravasation,
either the plexus surrounding the tubes, or the veins.

Many anatomists have taken extreme pains to inject the tubes from the pelvis of
the kidney, by means of the air-pump, but never has a single Malpighian body been
