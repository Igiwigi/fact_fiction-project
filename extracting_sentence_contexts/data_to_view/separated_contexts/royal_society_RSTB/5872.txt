A selection of the drawings showing the position in the hyphe of the fragments
developing into DH, and DH, is given in fig. 3.

Fig. 3 reveals the remarkable facts that DH, and DHy may develop from different
minor branches of the same hypha or even from contiguous fragments of one hypha. It may also be seen that those fragments which developed into DH, usually included
the extreme tip of a hypha, but there was no very marked consistency in the position
of fragments giving one strain or the other, since DH, also grew from the tip of a hypha
and DH, on a few occasions from the region behind the tip. A slightly modified method was adopted in a further series of experiments.
