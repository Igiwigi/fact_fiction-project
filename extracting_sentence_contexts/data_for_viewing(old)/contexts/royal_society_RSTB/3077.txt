In dealing with ovarian grafts, LACK’s experiments (1899), should also be noted. This investigator
scraped the epithelial cells from the incised surface of the ovaries, and on diffusing the dissociated

It is apparent that the successful experiments referred to above (especially those in
which the ovaries were transplanted to abnormal positions), support the doctrine that
the ovary is an organ producing an internal secretion.

Further evidence that the procestrum and cestrus are brought about by a substance
circulating in the blood but not necessarily elaborated by the ovary is supplied by
certain facts cited by Hanan (1901). This author states on the evidence of
Kenrer that the milk of suckling Sows is affected during the period of “ heat,” the
young as a consequence developing unhealthy symptoms. In a similar way the milk
from women is said to be affected during the menstrual periods. Also, according to
Youarr (1835) Cows can be brought “on heat” artificially by supplying them with
milk obtained from other Cows which are “on heat.”

Gourz’s experiments (1874) may also be cited as showing that “ heat” is not caused
by a cerebral reflex. In one experiment the spinal cord of a Bitch was transected in
the lumbar region. Normal procestrum followed by cestrus and conception occurred
unaccompanied by sensation, but the Bitch showed a distinct inclination towards the
Dog which she had not previously displayed. Pups were born after a full time
pregnancy. In another experiment (Gorrz and Ewatp, 1896) the lumbar part of
