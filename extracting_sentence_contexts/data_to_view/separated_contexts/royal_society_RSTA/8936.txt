It was then found that the effect of any Hammond operator upon any power of Q, is
merely to multiply it by a positive integer. It then appeared that, denoting Q, by
F(a, 8, y, ..-), the function

Q, = F (a’, BY, y', ...)

possesses properties of a character similar to those appertaining to Q,. The fact is
that any Hammond operator when performed upon any power of Q,, say Q;“ has the
effect. of merely multiplying it by an integer, which may exceptionally be zero. Finally the important fact emerged that the performance of any Hammond operator

upon the product
OOP... QM...

where hy, ky, ... kj, ... may, each of them, be zero or any positive integer, is merely to
multiply it by a positive integer, which may, exceptionally, be zero
