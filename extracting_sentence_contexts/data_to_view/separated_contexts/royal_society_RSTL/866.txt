76 Mr. HatcnerT's Experiments on the various Alloys,

«« These experiments were repeated, with exactly the same
« results; and seem to prove, beyond a doubt, that gold alloyed
« with tin may be repeatedly annealed, after passing the rollers,
« without-any danger, provided that due attention be paid to
* the temperature to which it is exposed.

« Hence it may fairly be said, that all which Mr. TiLLET has
« advanced on the foregoing subject, if closely attended to, will
« be found to go in confirmation of what Mr. ALcyorxe had
< previously asserted, relative to the mixture of gold with tin;
« and Mr. T:LLET only adduces the additional fact, of a greater
* degree of heat destroying the union of the two metals, which,
« from a full consideration of their peculiar properties, and dif-
« ferent fusibility and specific gravity, might have been inferred
* @ priori. It is-also reasonable to suppose, that whenever a
* combination of a more with a less fusible metal takes place,
« a temperature insufficient to fuse the whole mass would tend |
« to separate the one from the other; and this is the principle |
on which the process of eliquation depends.

« tin and gold, from reading the following passages.
