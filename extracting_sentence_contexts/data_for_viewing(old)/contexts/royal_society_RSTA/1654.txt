Inversion algorithms are a useful tool in observational solar physics. By providing a means to infer
various atmospheric parameters from Stokes profiles, one can begin to understand the evolution
of physical properties in the solar atmosphere over time and/or with height depending on the
observables.

There are numerous inversion algorithms with various advantages and disadvantages
associated with each based on the rationale for the actual code design. For example, Milneâ€”
Eddington inversions are fairly common ([1-6]; to name a few) and employ the Milne-Eddington
assumption that the physical properties that govern line formation are constant with depth to
solve the radiative transfer equation in the presence of a magnetic field [7-9]. Milne-Eddington
inversions tend to be quick to obtain a result, computationally speaking, and often give a good
approximation of field strengths at a given height [4,10] though they do have difficulties dealing
with asymmetric Stokes profiles due to the assumptions made by the code and the fact that real
data may have gradients in the velocity and magnetic field components.

More complex codes have been developed as well to fill the gap of specific needs for the
community, such as depth varying Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) based inversions
using response functions of the observed signals [11,12], codes that treat non-LTE conditions
where the rate equations are not dominated by collisional terms [13,14], codes that account
for both the Hanle and Zeeman effects [15,16], codes that use archive synthetic spectra
[17], non-LTE codes with analytical response functions [18] and non-LTE codes that include
partial redistribution effects [19]. Each of these codes have different pro et contra, with each
offering a valuable and vital resource to the community for various use cases. More recently
[20,21], convolutional neural networks have been used with Stokes inversions to speed up the
computational time taken to invert Stokes spectra. The results of this particular study would
