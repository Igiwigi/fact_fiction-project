we have | (p?+7)“|<(3N)! by (14-5). Hence | (9+7)A|>(3N)* by (14:6), which is the
required inequality.

By theorem V (§7), we have Ay(z’) = |#— 7d |~!, so the corollary follows immediately.

Finally, theorem XX follows at once from theorem XVIII and lemmas 14 and 15; and
theorem XIV follows from theorems XX and XVII. That the constant in theorem XX is
best possible follows from the already proved fact (§ 10) that theorem XIV is best possible.
Iftheorem XX could be improved, then so, by theorem XVII, could theorem XIV. Indeed,
by reversing the argument of this paragraph and using the converse of lemma 14, it is not

difficult to prove that ID
