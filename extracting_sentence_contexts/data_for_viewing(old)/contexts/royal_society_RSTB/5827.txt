brain except in the fimbria and the stria medullaris (the anterior nucleus and the main
part of the lateral nucleus of both sides being clear of osmic deposit). On the right
side the lesion of the ventral nucleus and the internal capsule is rather extensive, and
there is a wide distribution of degenerated fibres in the cortex which, however, does not
include the cingular areas or the most dorsal part of the parietal area.

Summarising the results of this experiment, the thalamic lesion on the right side is
limited to the ventral nucleus, the medial geniculate body, and some of the fibres of the
optic radiations. The distribution of Marchi degeneration in the cortex of this side
extends over all the lower part of the neopallium in the occipital and parietal regions,
reaching from the rhinal fissure below to the dorsal margin of the area striata and up to
the dorsal region of the parietal area above. The absence of Marchi degeneration in the
cingular area and in the most dorsal part of the parietal area is related to the fact that

the anterior nucleus and the lateral nucleus (main part) of this side were uninjured.
On the left side degenerated fibres are present in the area striata and in a zone of cortex
bounding this area ventrally and anteriorly. This is apparently associated—at least
in part—with the involvement by the lesion on this side of the anterior part of the pars
posterior of the lateral nucleus. As the serial sections at the site of the lesion were not
complete, it is not possible positively to exclude injury to the middle part of the left
