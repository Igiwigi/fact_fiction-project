Hence, as an interim measure, the original ideas of inexactness have been adapted to be relevant
to existing computing deterministic technologies. In this second approach, errors are induced by
eliminating parts of the computing hardware that are not deemed to be especially important to
the accuracy of the information being computed. Examples of the application of this ‘probabilistic
pruning’ approach to the Lorenz 96 model are described later in this Theme Issue [55].

To conclude this section, some remarks are made on the notion of seamless prediction. The key
motivation for seamless prediction studies is that by developing weather and climate simulators
that are as similar to one another as possible, insights and constraints from weather time scales
(where verification data are relatively plentiful) can be brought to bear on the climate time scale
(where verification data are less plentiful). However, in practice, ‘seams’ are inevitably apparent in
moving from weather and climate simulators, even though these simulators may share common
dynamical cores and parametrizations. Not least is the seam arising from the fact that weather and
climate simulators typically have different resolutions. A way to lessen this ‘resolution seam’ may
be possible using the ideas presented in this paper. That is to say, instead of changing from high
to low resolution as one moves from weather to climate prediction, it may be possible instead to
scale-selectively degrade precision with a single fixed resolution. It is planned to test this concept
on the two-tier ECMWF ensemble prediction system, where resolution is currently degraded
after day 10.

5. Conclusion

Since their inception, the PDEs for weather and climate have been solved numerically
by projecting the equations onto a computational grid and representing unresolved processes by
deterministic formulae. This has been referred to as the canonical numerical ansatz.
