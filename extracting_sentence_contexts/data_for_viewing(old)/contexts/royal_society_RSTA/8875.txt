accelerating voltages exceeding about four. There is the same tendency to haphazard
displacements of the curves parallel to the voltage axis as in the case of COCcl,.
The magnitude of this displacement seems, however, to tend to be smaller with
chlorine, the maximum separation I have observed in six characteristics taken
with this gas being 0-95 volt. The fact that the two curves shown in fig. 6
do not appear to be parallel is due to the distortion caused by the different vertical
scales. The standard current has the arbitrary value 1-09 in one case and 0-95 in
the other.

As in the case of COCI,, the various series have been reduced to unit saturation current
and displaced by varying amounts along the vertical axis to form a composite curve.
The various data referring to the relevant experimental series are given in the following
table and remarks :—
