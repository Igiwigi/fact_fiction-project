We
then inserted (vertically) a long needle at right angles to the plane of the section just
at the genu immediately in front of the most anterior extremity of the optic
thalamus. Each successive horizontal (parallel) section of the hemisphere contained,
consequently, the position of the genu as in the highest section (the upper level,
Group I[.). From these data we found that the position of the genu in its antero-posterior
relations varied extraordinarily little, but that the position of the entering angle of
the inner border was gradually transferred to that of the outer border, and, finally,
in the last three groups, the puncture revealed the fact that the position of the genu,
as seen in the highest section and now projected upon the lowest, had moved about
2 mm. in front of, and outside the angle of the outer border of the capsule, or 4 mm.
from its original site. In other words, the genu had moved backwards and inwards,
and this change of position was more rapidly developed in the lower than the upper
sections. Of course, the inward and backward direction of the efferent tracts is also seen
(especially the former) in frontal sections of the capsule.
