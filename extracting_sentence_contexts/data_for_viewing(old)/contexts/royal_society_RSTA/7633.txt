(d) Constancy of the refractive index of dry, CO,-free air. A noteworthy point arising
from a careful examination of the residuals (O—C) in Table VIII with respect to the
dates of the various measurements is that no evidence is found for any systematic change
of refractivity with sunspot activity, as has been suggested by Tilton, despite the fact
that the observed values given in Table VIII were obtained at three different dates
(cf. Table IT) during a period of rapid increase of such activity. Another interesting
feature is the remarkable constancy of the density of dry, CO,-free air as exhibited by
the refractivity measurements on forty different samples taken at different times over
a period of more than a year. This property of the atmosphere at the earth’s surface,
after moisture and CO, have been removed, has been noted in our work on the optical
