neuroscience The fact that the neocortex remains in a narrow range of its possible states of activity

between seizure and coma isa cause for celebration, but the processes that maintain
it in the face of Hebbian plasticity mechanisms that cause strong inputs to each
neuron to grow ever stronger are still obscure. The maintenance of a steady average
level of activity, averaged over long times, is referred to loosely as homeostasis. The
idea of homeostasis has a long history in physiology, dating at least from the work
of Claude Bernard more than 150 years ago on the stable regulation of the milieu
