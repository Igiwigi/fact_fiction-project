For example, in decomposing brains,
the anatomical structures, i.e. the skull and the cerebral cover-
ings, are left intact, so the cerebral tissues tend to keep their
anatomical relation to each other. This facilitates assessment
enormously compared with classical autopsy, where the
decomposing, liquefying brain oozes out as a papescent
mass after opening of the skull [38,39]. The fact that forensic imaging does not tamper with pre-
existing structures can also be of assistance when assessing
multiple comminute fractures of, for example, the skull
after repeated blows or gunshots. At autopsy, one is forced
to pull off the scalp, which may lead to the skull fragments
dislodging, which in turn will make a painstaking and
time-consuming reconstruction of the shattered skull necess-
ary. With CT one can evaluate the fracture pattern reliably
and easily and then, due to the fact that later fracture lines
do not cross pre-existing ones, determine which blows or
gunshots occurred first.
