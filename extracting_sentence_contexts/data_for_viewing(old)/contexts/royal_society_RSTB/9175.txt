different modes of bipedal locomotion and encephalization
were favoured, so might the fit between the neonatal head
and the maternal pelvis have shifted adaptively.

Recently, Grabowski [35] explored how the capacity for
evolutionary change in a given trait may be constrained
by stabilizing selection across a suite of covarying traits. In
relation to the obstetric dilemma, he suggested that such con-
straints may have reduced the overall evolvability of the birth
canal in earlier hominins, but that these constraints became
weaker in later hominins. A study of regional skeletal vari-
ability in recent human populations found that the pelvic
canal was, in fact, the most variable trait, suggesting that
stabilizing selection is no longer a major constraint [36].

While such genetic change can be assumed to have played a
role in the evolving obstetric dilemma, it also appears insufficient
as an explanation for the contemporary burden of mortality from
obstructed labour. Whatever the selective pressures acting on
adult encephalization and locomotion, the obstetric dilemma
is, in fact, the consequence of a clash not between two adult
traits, but between two developmental traitsâ€”growth of the
maternal pelvis and fetal growth. Their interaction at the
time of birth makes resolution of the dilemma a complex two-
party process, and selection furthermore acts not only on the
