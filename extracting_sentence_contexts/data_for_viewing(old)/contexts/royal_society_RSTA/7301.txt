be mentioned that lead telluride films with large positive thermoelectric powers and low
conductivity could be prepared, but only as the result of heating a lead-rich film above
200° C in tellurium vapour or oxygen. Films containing a small excess of tellurium were
sensitive to light, the conductivity increasing over a period of minutes during illumination.

O. SIMPSON ON THE

This is in sharp contrast to the photoconductivity of lead telluride with excess lead, for which
the response times were of the order of 100ysec. In no case were conductivities lower than
those in tables 3 and 4 observed; this fact gives additional weight to the assumption that
the first film of the evaporation series was close to stoichiometric composition.

‘THE MECHANISM OF CONDUCTION IN LEAD TELLURIDE FILMS

The starting point for any discussion of photoconductivity is the mechanism of conduction
under zero illumination. If the ‘dark’ conductivity can be interpreted in terms of the
distribution of current carriers and their mobility, the problem is reduced to determining
the modification of this distribution that is brought about under the influence of radiation.
There are surprisingly few references to lead telluride in the literature. Case (1917), in
a survey of a large number of naturally occurring crystals, observed no photoconductivity
