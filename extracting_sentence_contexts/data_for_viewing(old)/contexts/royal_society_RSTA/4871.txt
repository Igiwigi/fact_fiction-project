Figure 8. An example of temporal discretization of time evolution in a single BZ droplet. The total time of experiments divided
into a series of frames with length At. The moments of time at which the level of BZ inhibitor grows rapidly correspond to
chemical excitations in the medium. Time frames in which the droplet was excited are marked with symbol 1, whereas the
others are labelled with 0. (Online version in colour.)

The fact that one finds a droplet giving the best answer does not solve the problem completely.
An additional effort needs to be made by the observer to interpret this signal and to find a useful
classification rule which can be difficult [58]. Note that in the approach presented here, the output
of the network is limited, for simplicity, to a single droplet. However, for more complicated
classification problems, one can consider signals combined from multiple droplets.

Ina randomly selected classifier, one can expect random interactions between droplets so that
no useful computation is expected. In order to implement a certain functionality into the network
(like the classification ability), one has to adjust the parameters of the network using external
factors influencing the chemical excitations. Here, we assume that each droplet of the network can
be individually controlled by inhibiting the reaction inside in a specified time interval [0, finn].
In this interval, a droplet cannot self-excite or be triggered by its neighbours. Note that here the
inhibition is applied from the beginning of droplet evolution, however one can consider a more
