v! — Zw(t) = —q[v — Z(H]. The value 1— Ce is the measure of dissipation (inelasticity); the
previous purely elastic case corresponds to q=1. In this case, there are also stable periodic
regimes, and now they are asymptotically stable (stable attractors, small initial deviations decay
with time) (figure 3a,b). For large initial deviations, chaotic dynamics takes place, as in the
previous case (figure 3c).

The results presented in this section indicate that classical particles in the dynamical billiard
with elastic collisions have dynamics intermediate between conservative and dissipative ones.
The neutral, in contrast to asymptotic, stability of fixed points is a feature of conservative systems.
On the other hand, the increase of average energy for evolution with small initial energy is
characteristic for dissipative systems. The dynamics of the particle resembles the dynamics of
conservative systems [22], though the particle energy is not conserved after collisions. This could
be explained by the fact that this energy can both increase and decrease due to collisions, and the
energy is conserved at the average over the period of wall position modulation. For non-elastic
collisions, we have asymptotic stability of periodic regimes, but chaotic dynamics takes place
again for large deviations of the initial values from the steady-state values.

3. Asingle quantum particle in a dynamical trap

For quantum particles in a trap, essential are their wave nature and their energy spectrum
discreteness. If a classical particle can be motionless with an arbitrary position between oscillating
walls, a quantum particle cannot be at rest, and its wave function should oscillate because of
the walls’ oscillations. Additionally, owing to the wave features and corresponding ‘dispersion’
and ‘diffraction’, the wave packet of an initially localized quantum particle diffuses with time.
This diffusion can be compensated if we consider, not a single particle, but a large number of
