SENONENSIS (‘ EPIASTER GIBBUS’ )

As stated above, Rowe had divided his Northfleet specimens between three main
groups: the first contained those specimens which he considered to be true Epzaster gibbus
(Micraster senonensis) (E32513 to 32539); the second forms which he believed to be typical
examples of Micraster coranguinum (E32759 to 33078, E33103 to 33133, E33191 to 33217,
E33880 and E33881); and the last consisted of the transitional forms between these two
species (E32410 to 32511, E32540 to 32545). ‘The distinction between the M. coranguinum
auctorum of Rowe and his M. coranguinum var. latior may be disregarded. As Rowe himself
says (1899), the latter is only the broad form of the former. ‘This difference does not warrant
a separate varietal name. It is important, however, to decide whether Rowe was justified
in considering his sample to consist of two closely related species which overlap in some
morphological characters, or whether, in fact, it consists of a single, very variable, species.
M. senonensts is stated to differ from M. coranguinum in the general shape and proportions
of its test, in its possession of a petaloid anterior ambulacrum, and in its lack of a sub-anal
fasciole (Lambert 1895, 1901). These three sets of characters will now be dealt with
separately.

(a) The shape of the test in the two spectes

The sample was divided into Rowe’s three groups, and the following correlation
tables were drawn up for each group separately. The first set of these consisted of measure-
ments (b) to (e) and (g) plotted against measurement (a). The second set consisted of
measurements (c) to (e) and (g) plotted against measurement (b). The last set consisted
of only a single correlation table for each group, measurement (c) being plotted against
