It is well known that the various groups of people in New Guinea speak different
languages, and though they are frequently in hostility with each other, yet the necessity
for trade breaks down these barriers. In the intervals of hostilities groups meet for
barter and in many cases to attend ceremonies and other festive occasions. This inter-
course is facilitated by the fact that on the borders of linguistic areas there are always
some bilingual persons. The hypothesis is here adopted that the cultivation of tobacco spread from the
north-west of New Guinea to the south-east along the main and subsidiary mountain
ranges, whence in many places it extended by secondary spreads to the plains or even
> to the coast. There are several definite records which prove that there is a recognized
trade in tobacco between the very short mountain people and those who live at lower
altitudes, and there is a similar trade between the interior folk and the coastal fisher-
men.
