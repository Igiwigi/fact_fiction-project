The yalues given in (84) for E, and E; are to be used for any internal point, at a distance
7 from the centre, in these equations (86), and thus we have the simplest possible ex-
pression for the required displacement of any point of the solid.

53. If we resolye the displacement along and perpendicular to the radins, and con-
sider only the radial component, we see that the series of concentric spherical surfaces
of the undisturbed globe become spheroids of revolution in the distorted body. The
elongation of the axial radius, obtained by putting 9=0 and taking the value of &, is
double the shortening of the equatorial radius, obtained by putting 9=4z and taking
the value of p; which we might have inferred from the fact, shown by the general
equations (80) above, that there can be no alteration of yolume on the whole within any
one of these 8urfaces. The expression for the excess of the axial aboye the equatorial
radius is =re,+? e, 4
