The fact that the cyclic curves obtained from the metal in this state had somewha
rounded outlines, and gave values of [HdI, which, though by no means exceptionally
great, are greater than those given by the softest iron, led us to suspect that the
metal had been slightly hardened, either in the manufacturer's hands, or in o
coiling it into a ring for testing. Accordingly, we resolved to make another trial
after annealing the wire in the coiled up state. The ring (No.
