the relationship between them. The circuit diagram of the full bridge series resonant inverter is
shown in figure 3.

The excitation coil is presented as a series RL circuits. In fact, due to the large excitation
current during detection, the inductance and resistance values on the connecting wires of the
circuit cannot be ignored. Here, resistance R; and inductance L; take into account the electrical
parameters of the excitation coil and the connecting wire. The sample is modelled as an inductor
L, and an impedance Z, = R, +jXe, which is related to the material properties of the sample.
According to Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law, the following Equations can be obtained:

. 1 .
Vo= (R +jwLs + ac) In — jwMIe (2.3)
and
(Re + jwLe + jXe) le — jwMly = 0, (2.4)

where V2 and I are the secondary output voltage and current of transformer Tj, respectively.
