following pages there will be found no speculations, as I have confined myself to a
simple delineation of appearances, and to the most obvious conclusions arising from
them. If in any points I have been mistaken, that indulgence will, I trust, be ac-
corded which may be fairly claimed in exploring one of the most hidden regions of
physiology. That in the main facts I have not erred seems probable, from the re-
peated opportunities afforded for their confirmation. The number of Rabbits ex-
amined considerably exceeds a hundred, and I have recorded in my notes the particular
results regarding eighty-nine. Besides ova that were till present in the ovary and
apparently destined to escape, ninety-three have been found in the Fallopian tube, and
two hundred and thirty-six in the uterns.
