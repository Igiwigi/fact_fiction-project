Tf the daily rhythm observed by Reprretp in Phrynosoma is explicable along lines
similar to these, then the important conclusions follows that Phrynosoma displays
the same remarkable reversal of the white background response in weak light as the
chameleon. At present, however, no such conclusion is warranted, since REDFIELD
does not record observations on the daily rhythm of blind animals, nor does he define
the conditions under which his observations were made. He does not state whether
the animals were indoors or in the open, and makes no reference to the season of the
year. The latter is a curious omission for during at least six months out of the twelve
“the heat of midday ” in Massachusetts is not intense.

The mechanism of nervous control.—The work of Briicxr, KELLER, Bert, and Hogpen
and Mrrvisu has established beyond question the fact that the chromatophores of the
chameleon are under the control of the nervous system. HocBen and Mirvisu have

further shown that the innervation is derived from the autonomic system. REDFIELD’S
conclusions on this question have already been quoted (see p. 42). His work on the
role of the adrenals in the pigmentary responses of Phrynosoma constitutes the exclusive
evidence on which Parker bases his recent claims that both nervous and endocrine
factors are concerned in reptilian colour response (for quotations see p. 28). In view
of the importance ascribed to Reprienp’s work it is necessary here to draw attention
to a contradiction in his experimental data which leaves his main conclusion almost
