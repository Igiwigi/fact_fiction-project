Gp =Gpu, = Gpz =0 Mik ° (A6)

since

a,L4=G,=0, ,,,L4%=Gou, =0, a

roe Gor =0.
Interestingly, the condition Vv, LH =0 leads to the following exponential form of the
equilibrium state:

fr) =aexp[-( + dp + Apu Cia + ApECr I, (A7)

due to the fact that V,H =Infj +1.
Applying the same steps with the general set of constraints (2.12), one obtains the following
(generalized) Lagrange function:

Lip =H + > Ave Gpgr- (A8)

The condition Vy Lie =0 eventually leads to

f; 1 =aexp - (: “Zagat | (A9)

It is worth noting that the above form of the numerical equilibrium is not unique and,
