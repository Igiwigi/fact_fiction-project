of the subsequent leaves varied according to the positions and sequence of I,a, Ik
and I,.

Details of these experiments are given in Table VI, and it can be seen that in all of
them except the last (No. 32) the position of the wound, as indicated by its angle from

P,, was distinctly to the kathodic side of the normal position of the centre of I,. If
allowance is made for the fact that the angles P,-wound, as measured, were probably
about 3°+5 too small (see section 5), then these angles show that, except in No. 32, the
divergences of the wounds from the true median position ranged from about 6° to 11° in
the kathodic direction. On the other hand wounds which were more nearly median,
usually led to the development of I,k only, as in Nos. 16, 22, 24 and 25 (see Table II).
The explanation of these facts, which are at first surprising, is probably that the space
available for leaf-formation was usually smaller on the anodic side of the wound (see
section 11). For unless I,a arose well before I,, the space available for it was limited
by I,, which lay closer to the anodic side of the wound than to the kathodic side. It
may be noted that in No. 32 in which the wound was approximately median and yet
I,a developed as a leaf as well as I,k, I,a did arise before I,, and I, was unable to prevent
itsdevelopment. The results of the different sub-groups will now be more fully described
in turn.
