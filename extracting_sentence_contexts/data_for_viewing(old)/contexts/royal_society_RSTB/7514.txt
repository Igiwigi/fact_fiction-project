of the nature of a subsidiary histone. The presence of this protein might well account for
the isoleucine found in Block & Bolling’s and Tristam’s preparations of salmine.

Discussion

There remains for discussion the question of the significance of the cell specificity,
demonstrated in the course of this investigation, of the basic proteins present in cell
nuclei. Before considering this problem, however, it should be pointed out that these
basic proteins constitute quantitatively major components of cell nuclei, for they
represent from 20 to 30 % of the dry weight of the various nuclei examined. As such
they must in part be responsible for the formation of one or other of the chief structures
of the nucleus. It has been shown elsewhere (Stedman & Stedman 19474, 6) that, in
combination with nucleic acid, they do, in fact, form the nuclear sap in the resting and
prophase, and the spindle in the metaphase, nucleus. For the exercise of such structural
functions, which cannot of course be wholly divorced from physiological ones, cell speci-
ficity would presumably be inessential. In order to gain some insight into the meaning
of the specificity it is therefore necessary to attempt to visualize the more purely physio-
logical functions of the basic proteins. Unfortunately, the mechanism by which the
nucleus itself exerts its functions, whatever these may be, is little understood. Nevertheless,
it is a principle of cytogenetics that each nucleus of an organism contains at least one set
of the chromosomes, and hence all of the genes, of that organism. It is, therefore, pre-
sumably through the activity of these hypothetical units that the function of the nucleus
must be exercised. There is, however, one difficulty inherent in this view. If all the genes
are active in every nucleus of an organism, any one nucleus would be physiologically
identical with another. The action of individual genes would not then be limited, as the
