This con-
dition will be rapidly and continuously propagated from below upwards, and, pro-
viding the air immediately outside the cylinder is maintained of uniform composition,
and the air within the cylinder is perfectly free from convection and thermal currents,
a static condition will soon be established in the column. When this has been
attained we may regard the uncompensated balances of exchange between any
contiguous layers in the cylinder as constituting a steady flua or drift of carbon
dioxide in the direction of the axis of the cylinder from the outer air to the absorbent
surface. By adopting a simple mental device of this kind we can avoid the necessity of con-
stantly referring all the observed facts to the kinetic exchange of particles between
the contiguous layers of the gases, and so enormously simplify a study of the
phenomena of static diffusion, which now become capable of simple mathematical
treatment similar to that employed for investigating the “flow” of heat in a bar
after the permanent state has been reached, or the “ flow” of electricity between any
two regions of a conductor maintained at a constant difference of potential. When static diffusion is established under the conditions mentioned above, the
following statements will hold good :—

(1) The same quantity (mass) of carbon dioxide will pass through every cross-
section of the column in a given time. (2) The quantity (mass) of the gas flowing down columns of equal length and
equal cross-section, in equal times, will be directly proportional to the
difference of the partial pressures of the carbon dioxide at the mouth of the
cylinder and immediately above the absorbing surface.
