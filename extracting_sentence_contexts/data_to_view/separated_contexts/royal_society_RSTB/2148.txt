298 PROFESSORS CASH AND DUNSTAN ON THE PHARMACOLOGY OF

The Muscle Curve. Wretanp* stated that aconitine produced marked prolongation of the muscle
curve, relaxation of the muscle being much retarded; such an effect, in fact, as is
associated with veratrine. BucHem and EiseNMENGERt also spoke of a considerable variation from the
normal condition. These observations have not been supported by Murray,{ nor by Boum with
WarrtMann,§ who believe the curve to be unaffected by aconitine.
