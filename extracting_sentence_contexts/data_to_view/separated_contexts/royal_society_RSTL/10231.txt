The addition of a trace of aqueous vapour to the non-inflammable mixture
causes it to become inflammable, all other conditions remaining the same.

3, The addition of a trace of hydrogen or of a volatile body containing hydrogen
causes the dry mixture to become inflammable, all other conditions remaining the
Same.

4. The rapidity of explosion of the mixture in a tube one metre long is greater
with a large quantity of aqueous vapour than when only a trace is present. These well-established facts, coupled with the fact that carbonic oxide does de-
Z compose steam at a high temperature, appear to me to show conclusively that in
5 the ordinary explosion of carbonic oxide and oxygen, the union is not a direct one,
E but is effected indirectly by the agency of hydrogen. In a paper on the alkaline peroxides,* the late Sir B. BroDIE has thus described
8uch an indirect action :—*© The alkaline peroxides have a double function, and can
be used as agents either of oxidation or of reduction.
