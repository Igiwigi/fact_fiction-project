(a) Vessel-Member Length
The study of vessel-member length throughout a large number of families has
shown (BAILEY 1920) that the length of a vessel member is approximately the same
as that of the cambial initial from which it was derived, and the significance of vessel-

member length lies in the fact that it provides a measure of the length of the cambial
initial where the initials themselves are not available. In hardwoods generally a wide
range in vessel-member length may be encountered, and Frost (19304, 6, 1931) has
shown that there is a relation between the length of the vessel members, the type of
perforation plate and the type of intervascular pitting. He has also established the fact
that, on the whole, woods with long vessel members, scalariform perforation plates
and scalariform intervascular pitting are more primitive than those with shorter
vessel members, simple perforation plates and alternate intervascular pitting. Sub-
sequent research has confirmed his conclusions, and it is now possible to use vessel-
member length to deduce the relative positions of woods from different families; and
also as a guide to the relative position of the genera within a family, and to assess the
significance of other features in the wood.

The vessel-member length for the different genera in the Sterculiaceae is shown in
fig. 1. There is considerable overlapping between the ranges for the different genera
