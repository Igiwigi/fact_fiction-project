All single-walled carbon nanotubes of
all chiralities are given by a helical group acting ona single atomic position. (See [39] for formulae
for the helical groups.) They are particularly common in viruses. In [13], it is shown that the
positions and orientations of molecules on the tail sheath of bacteriophage T4 are accurately given
by a helical group operating on a single molecule. In fact, the tail sheath of this virus actually
undergoes a phase transformation during the process of infection, and both phases are orbits

transformations and Diao et al. [42] for interesting, atomistic effects such as surface energy induced phase transformation

strong conditions of compatibility given below.) As another important example, the Ebola virion 1S

apparently exhibits four helical structures, see [44]. eae
