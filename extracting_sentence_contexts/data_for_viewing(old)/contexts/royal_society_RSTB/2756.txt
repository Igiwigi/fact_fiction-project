an excess of follicular atresia, whether occurring during the sexual season or at some
previous period.

I have no evidence that cestrus can occur in ewes in the total absence of mature
follicles in both ovaries, but I see no reason even in such animals as the sheep, for
regarding the connection between ovulation and cestrus to be such an essentially close
one as is often maintained, According to all the evidence of sheep-breeders, tem-
porary barrenness is not necessarily associated with omission of cestrus (or extension
of ancestrum), and I found no relation between the intensity of the cestrous (and
procestrous) phenomena and the number of follicles discharged during the particular
cestrus.

Mr. Heapre (1900) has laid some stress on the fact that ovulation is not always
associated with menstruation in the Primates, and that it may require a stimulus in
addition to that supplied by cestrus in the case of the female rabbit ; and in the
present paper I have shown that with the bitch ferret while the procestrum and
cestrus are distinct periods, the latter may continue for several weeks, during which
the animal will permit the occurrence of coition, although the time for ovulation has
passed by.

It would appear then that while the rate of growth and maturation of the follicles
are the result of nutriment and general physical condition, besides being dependent
