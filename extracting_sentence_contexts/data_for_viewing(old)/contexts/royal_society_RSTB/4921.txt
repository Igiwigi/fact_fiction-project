Texr-ric. 2.—Experiment upon migration of the young larve of D. niisslini from an infected
silver fir (A) to a healthy plant (B).

(4) The tips of the branches were always sought in preference to the lower portions,
and the upper branches were more markedly sought after than the lower. The
undersides of the branches were chosen in preference to the upper and less
protected region.

The results of this experiment were interesting as reproducing the peculiar behaviour
of the insect already observed under natural conditions, and correlated the presence
of the Chermes at the tips of the branches with the death of these, a fact which had
long been suspected.

This laboratory experiment and the extensive field data available, relative to the
destructive nature of the insect’s attack, suggested an investigation into the source
of supply from which the insect drew its food, and the physiological effect upon the

plant of its attacks. This question has already been studied in the case of other hemi-
pterous forms by a number of workers, and a short review of the literature concerned is
given below.
