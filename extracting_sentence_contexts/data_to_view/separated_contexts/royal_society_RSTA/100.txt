As indicated above, it is supposed that in the meteor-swarm the rigid envelope
bounding the isothermal sphere is replaced by a layer of meteorites in convective
equilibrium. The law of density in the adiabatic layer is determined in § 5, and it
appears that, when the isothermal sphere has minimum temperature, the mass of the
adiabatic atmosphere is a minimum relatively to that of the isothermal sphere. Numerical calculation shows, in fact, that the isothermal sphere cannot amount in
mass to more than 46 per cent. of the mass of the whole isothermal-adiabatic sphere,
and that the limit of the adiabatic atmosphere is at a distance equal to 2°786 times
the radius of the isothermal sphere. *
