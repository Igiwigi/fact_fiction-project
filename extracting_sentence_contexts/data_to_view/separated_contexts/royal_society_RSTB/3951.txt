It has been shown by PrinesuEt (74) that
many of the adaptations shown by micro-organisms to abnormal temperature
conditions become fixed, and are apparently transmissible through many generations

both sexually and by means of spores. ON THE EXPERIMENTAL HYBRIDIZATION OF ECHINOIDS. 329

The facts recorded in the foregoing paragraphs justify us therefore in suggesting
that the temperature conditions of the sea-water, acting on the germ cells of our
Echinoids during their period of growth, may have played a part in changing the
type of inheritance in 1912. It is obviously useless, until we have more data at our
disposal, to discuss this question at greater length. 15.
