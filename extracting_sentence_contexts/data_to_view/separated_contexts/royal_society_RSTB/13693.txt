Indeed, ravens likely rely inferred hierarchies in our population included around 50
on multiple sites to forage, e.g. other anthropogenic food marked birds per period, which were seen at least 10% of
sources. It is thus likely that birds that encounter each other the time at the feedings. The fact that on average only half
in our foraging site also meet in other locations [38]. Future of the birds in the local foraging groups are marked suggests
studies will aim to investigate multiple neighbouring foraging that ravens foraging at our study site might be able to deal
sites to detect communities of individuals that meet more often with up to 100 conspecifics. Such estimates compare well
than others, and analyse whether dominance rank is bound to with the extensive memory skills for conspecifics found in
a specific geographical location or a community of individuals. elephants [83], sheep [84] and dolphins [85], and are in line

with the hypothesis that high degrees of fissionâ€”fusion
dynamics may lead to improved memory skills [31].
