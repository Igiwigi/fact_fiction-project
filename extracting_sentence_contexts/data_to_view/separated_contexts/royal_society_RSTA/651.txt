Haven and A. Khrennikov provides an intriguing example of a possible
role of quantum-like discreteness in market economics [55].5 A phenomenon of quantum
tunnelling occurs when a particle tunnels through a barrier that it would not be able to surmount
if it behaved classically and is thus a quantum phenomenon par excellence. The process itself
cannot be observed. (In the present view, no quantum process could be.) We only deal with
observable effects of this process, specifically with the fact that there is a non-zero probability that

4 Arguments for such connections have been advanced, prominently by R. Penrose, from his first major work on the subject
[54] on. While Penroseâ€™s theory primarily concerns the neurobiology of the brain and consciousness, Penrose also links his
argument to the possibility that life itself is a quantum effect.

a particle can be found beyond the barrier, which is to say that the corresponding measurement
will register an impact of this particle on the measuring instrument beyond the barrier.
