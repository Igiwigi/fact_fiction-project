The desire of Stonefields residents to have a stormwater re-use system for the ‘sustainability’
aspect—outside of technical or economic logic—challenged normal thinking. The experiment
worked to give residents a voice to protest technocratic-administrative regulation and control
of water, albeit temporarily. It was clear from the interviews that the third-pipe experiment
triggered passionate opinions and conversation. Its ‘failure’ was known and discussed city-wide.
It politicized. It created a disturbance. This disturbance revealed, at least for a time, the dominant
logics and quelling tactics of technocratic water management. And by revealing them it allowed
them to be contested. Similar experiments are happening in cities around the world and might
also be understood through their visibility which allows the status quo to be challenged. This
is quite different to the usual understanding of water infrastructure, the limits of which are
starting to be acknowledged [37,38]. It is not that the values inherent in the experiment with
the stormwater third pipe will never be normal, but rather, they have yet to become normal. The
fact that the third pipe exists at all is a testament to the fact that change is happening and ‘normal’
has already been questioned.

The paper, then, analysed an experiment with water infrastructure, not with the intention of
fixing politics, but instead to open or reveal them. A third-pipe stormwater reticulation system
was installed at the Stonefields housing development to harvest runoff and reduce potable water
demand. It was found that discourses of safety, cost and security were used to close down
conversations about the alternative infrastructure. These discourses made it difficult for the third



pipe to be realized because they labelled the experiment as a ‘bad idea’ and not constructive for
society. Although this verdict mobilized post-political processes to foreclose contradictions of ‘the
