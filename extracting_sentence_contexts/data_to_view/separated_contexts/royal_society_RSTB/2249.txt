A lesion in this region would consequently cause a more or less
complete hemiopic defect of vision without any necessary involvement of the optic
radiations. T have in fig. 3 (p. 178) reproduced a few of the more typical of the very numerous
lesions recorded during the past 37 years, as it is impossible to refer to them all in
detail without losing more in lucidity than would be gained by completeness. The case of Hun (13) (fig. 3, 1) is particularly interesting, owing to the small size
of the lesion and to the fact that it was evident clinically as blindness of the left lower
quadrant of each visual field, or the right upper quadrant of each retina. The case of HuGuEntn (20) (fig. 3, 2) is one of a small tuberculous tumour situated
as in the diagram. Of course it may have affected the neighbouring parts, but it is,
at any rate, focussed on the greater part of the exactly-defined area to which I shall
later on draw attention.
