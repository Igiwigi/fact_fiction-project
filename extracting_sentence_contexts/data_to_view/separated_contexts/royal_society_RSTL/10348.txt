of the produce on an increasing number of plots from one
separation year to another; and in the last it did 80 only on highly-manured plots,
and especially on those with nitrate of soda. As is een, it did not, on the majority of
the plots, reach 5 per cent. ; in fact, on many it was quite insignificant in amount ; but
under the influence of liberal manuring favourable to it, it reached from 10 to 15, and
even to nearly 24 per cent. From the foregoing results it appears that the deep and freely-rooting Alopecurus
pratensis, with its numerous underground stolons, thrives best with high manuring,
supplying much nitrogen. In this respect it comes into competition with Dactylis
glomerata ; which, however, maintains its prominence on the ammonia but not on the
nitrate plots; whereas the Alopecurus does 80 on both the nitrate and the ammonia plots.
