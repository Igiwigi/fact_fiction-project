In the case of La(FeSi);3H; compounds, it has : S

been reported [18] that, while the magnetocaloric effect decreases under an applied pressure
in LaFe11 57Si1,43 (LaFeSi), it is instead enhanced in the LaFe1;57Si1.43H1.64 hydride. In both
LaFeSi and LaFeSi-hydride, the magnetostructural transition is shifted to lower temperatures by
increasing the applied pressure. The different effect of pressure on the magnetocaloric response
seems to be a consequence of the fact that, while the magnetization change at the transition
strongly decreases by application of pressure in LaFeSi, it is almost pressure independent in
the hydrides. Pressure experiments reported by Caron et al. [19] in hexagonal NizIn-type Mnj,CryCoGe
compounds reveal that pressure is able to tune the temperature at which the magnetostructural
phase transition occurs. However, the magnitude of the magnetocaloric effect is almost insensitive
to the applied pressure.
