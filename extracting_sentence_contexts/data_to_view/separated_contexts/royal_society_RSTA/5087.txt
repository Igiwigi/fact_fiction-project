This occurs at a distance R* ~R+ A+ 1. from the cylinder centre, where R is the
cylinder radius, A is the thickness of the shell surrounding the cylinder and /, is the edge length
of the fluid-mesh elements around the shell. This is only an estimation of R*, because it further
depends on where the shell and fluid meshes intersect one another within one fluid element. As a result, the aerodynamic forces in the IS results are obtained by integrating the pressure
and viscous forces on the surface of the fictitious cylinder of diameter D* = 2R*. Table 1 shows
the drag coefficient obtained using the DB and IS approaches. The results obtained by the two
methods are very close, and also match the values reported in the literature [24,25].
