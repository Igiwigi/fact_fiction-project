The visual signals of fighting ability
probably minimize the cost of conflict by allowing individuals
to avoid escalated conflict with strong rivals [46,140]. Signals of
fighting ability are one of multiple factors that mediate domi-
nance hierarchy establishment, but they are not involved in
maintaining hierarchies on nests. In fact, wasps ignore visual
status signals on stable nests [141].

4. Opportunities for future research

Dominance hierarchies have been the focus of much research
in the 100 years since Schjelderup-Ebbeâ€™s [2,142] pioneering
work in domestic fowl. It has become clear that dominance
relationships are common in social taxa, as they provide a
way for interacting animals to manage the trade-offs inherent
in social interactions.
