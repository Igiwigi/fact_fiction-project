oxidation ; chemical action thus exciting electricity, which in its turn reproduces the
original equivalent of chemical action. In like manner, when water at 212® is con-
verted into steam, the heat which it receives is no longer manifested as heat, but
mechanical force is developed in its stead, and this in a certain definite ratio; as
800n. however, as the steam, losing its elasticity by condensation, returns to the
condition of water, the original equivalent of heat is again developed, its mechanical
force being no longer manifested.

Whether we regard it as most consonant to our ideas of the nature of force, to con-
sider the one force, in any such case, as itself becoming latent, whilst it excites an
equivalent measure of a force of another kind which was previously dormant,—or
whether we consider that the one force is actually converted into the other, and that
there is really no snch condition as dormant or latent force,—the fact of the mutual
relationship, and the definite character of that relationship, remains the same ; and
it is upon this, rather than upon any hypothetical representation of it, that the author
wishes chiefly to insist. Although, therefore, the terms © conversion ” and © meta-
morphosis” will be occasionally employed in the present paper, as the most convenient
modes of expressing the author's meaning, he is desirous that it should be understood
that he does not desire to imply anything else than the existence of the relationship
Jjust defined.

One more preliminary remark is necessary, upon a point on which Prof. Grove has
not thought it requisite strongly to dwell ; namely, the necessity for a certain material
substratum/as the medium of the change in question. Thus, to take a familiar case,
the correlation 'of Electricity and Magnetism is indicated by the development of
