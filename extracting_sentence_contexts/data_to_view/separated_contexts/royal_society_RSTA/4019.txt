From the known character of Réntgen
rays, it was quite impossible for this great ionization to be produced by rays which
could be absorbed by a layer of aluminium ‘032 millim.—the difference in thickness
of the two windows. Again, an ordinary focus tube illustrates very well the fact that the Réntgen
rays produced issue in a large measure from the face of the anticathode, upon
which the cathode rays fall, while the radiation appearing to come from the opposite
face is always very weak. The theory now generally accepted is that the Réntgen
rays are electromagnetic pulses sent through the ether when the moving electrified
particles which constitute the cathode rays are suddenly stopped. If then the
Réntgen radiation sent out in the direction of propagation of the cathode rays, when
these carriers were stopped by foil ‘04 millim.
