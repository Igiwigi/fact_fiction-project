competitors for the donor bacteria. If establishing a symbiosis
within the plant is the bacterial equivalent of winning the lot-
tery, then transfer of the symbiosis genes required for a given
host is akin to handing out lottery tickets.

However, the dynamics of symbiosis genes in rhizobial
populations is not under the control of the bacterial cells
that host them. Rather it is driven by the MGEs that encode
and carry them. Genetic elements with the ability to transmit
to new hosts have—to varying degrees—their own evolution-
ary interests on which selection can act, sometimes to the
detriment of the bacterial host they inhabit [1]. Thus the rhi-
zobium-legume symbiosis should in fact be seen as a
tripartite interaction between the plant, the bacteria and the
MGEs that carry the functional trait [2]. In this review, we
will examine the world of the sym element, asking two cen-
tral questions: how mobile is the symbiosis, and what forces
shape mobility among sym elements?

2. How mobile is symbiosis?

Mobility of the symbiosis trait can be observed through pat-
terns of symbiosis gene distribution within and between
thizobial clades, as well as through examination of the
specific MGEs that carry them. Overall the evidence points
