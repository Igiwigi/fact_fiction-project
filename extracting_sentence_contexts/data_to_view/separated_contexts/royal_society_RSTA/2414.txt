Substituting the standard alkyl chains by polar sidechains has also been proved to be an
efficient way of increasing compatibility with the dopants and enhancing doping efficiency while
retaining good mechanical properties [17,2224]. Multicomponent systems containing flexible
polymer matrices could also help to retain flexibility [25,26]. To address the technological issue
of doping thick films, a number of methods have been proposed, such as multilayer formation
(which takes advantage of the fact that doped films are insoluble [27,28]), or introducing porosity
[29]. Carbon nanotube matts and composites are naturally very porous and thus dopants can
easily go through the films (figure 4c and reference [30]). The challenge there is to be able to
produce the thick film itself, as CNTs do not readily dissolve in common solvents.
