Hence the efficiency for producing positive ionisation of a given
amount of hydrogen diffusing out of platinum increases rapidly with increasing

temperature. 12


60 F MR. O. W. RICHARDSON ON THE IONISATION The fact that hydrogen diffusing out of a platinum wire produces a positive
ionisation proportional to the amount of gas diffusing, taken in conjunction with the
fact that the additional ionisation so produced, even when the amount of gas
diffusing per minute is equal to 1 cub. centim. at 0Â° C. and 760 millims.
