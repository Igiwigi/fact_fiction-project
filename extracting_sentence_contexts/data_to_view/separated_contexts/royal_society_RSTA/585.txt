It has been pointed out (Longuet-Higgins & Ursell 1948) that Miche, in a theoretical
study of wave motion (1944), discovered that the mean pressure on the bottom beneath a
train of standing waves is not constant, as in a progressive wave, but fluctuates with an
amplitude independent of the depth and proportional to the square of the wave height. This
oscillation is of precisely the type required for the generation of ground movement, for not
only is it unattenuated with depth (and is therefore the most important term at depths greater
than about half a wave-length) but also, being in phase at all points of the bottom, it is suit-
able for producing long seismic waves. A further remarkable fact is that the frequency of
this pressure variation is twice the fundamental frequency of the waves. Owing to the cus-
tomary neglect of terms of higher order than the first, this term had been overlooked, the
standing wave being in the first approximation the sum of two progressive waves of equal
amplitudes travelling in opposite directions. A shorter proof of Micheâ€™s result, bringing to

+ An attempt was made by Banerji (1935) to show that the compressibility of the water would allow
pressure variations of the same period as the surface waves to be transmitted to depths great compared with
the wave-length.
