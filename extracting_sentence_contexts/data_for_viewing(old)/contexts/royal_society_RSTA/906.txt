are the normalized eigenvectors of M~!K. For simplicity, we assume that the damping matrix
B can be expressed as a linear combination of the mass and stiffness matrices and, therefore, is
also diagonalized by the matrix P. This diagonalization process is equivalent to expressing the
particle displacements x; in equation (5.1) in terms of modal displacements un, using the relation
Xj = Pintn, and then left-multiplying both sides by P™, resulting in

PimMiPintin + PimBijPjntin + PimKijPinun + Pim TijkPinPauna = PimFi(t). (5.4)

The diagonalized system in equation (5.4) does not provide any significant numerical advantage,
because I”jj, is highly non-local in the modal basis (ie. modes far apart in frequency interact as
strongly as nearby modes). However, we can see the motivation for this approach if we look at
the experimental results in the modal basis (figure 3a). In this basis, most of the motion occurs
in the second extended mode and in the localized mode. In fact, these modes hold around 90%
of the system’s energy (figure 3b). Therefore, we can restrict our description to these two modes
without incurring a significant error. To construct this reduced description, we consider equation
(5.5) for the indices m = E and m=L, where E and L are the mode numbers corresponding to the
localized and second extended modes, respectively. We also prescribe the values of uy, and 1) to
be zero for all values of n and | different from E and L. With these restrictions in place, equation
(5.4) can be rewritten as

my it, + by, + (ky — 2yug)uy = F) cos(2zfjt) (5.5)

and
meiig + bette + keug — yuz =0. (5.6)
In this reduced description, uj, and ug are the displacements of the localized and
