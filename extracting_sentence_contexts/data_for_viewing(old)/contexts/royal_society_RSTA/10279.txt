Consider now MarrHressEn’s important generalisation,§ that metals may sustain
change in their molecular condition by union with each other in a fused state.
Roperts-AvsTEN points out|| that the evidence that metals ever assume allotropic
states, when they enter into union with each other, is difficult to obtain. When
obtained, the evidence is generally composed of the facts that the specific gravity of
the normal metal is greater than that of the metal in the state alleged to be allotropic ;
that the chemical activity is less in amount, although the same in kind, for the former
than for the latter state ; and that the appearance of the metal is different in the two
states. Reference is also sometimes made to a difference in physical ‘properties which
is accounted for by lack of continuity, and consequently of electric conductivity, in
the supposed allotropic state.1 Occasional reference is also made to a readiness to
form hydrates which the metal in the latter state exhibits. Setting this last property
aside, as not yet established, the remaining evidence is not conclusive, for all the facts
in question are also characteristic of optically continuous granular (or amorphous)
pieces of metal. Increase of chemical activity, for example, is a consequence of the
enormous effective surface in a medium built up of independent granules.

Further, when one metal is united with another in a fused state, a chemical
compound is not, in general, formed, but the molecules of the two metals freely mix.
Thus one metal is in solution in the other. So long, therefore, as the temperature
remains sufficiently high to permit the molecules to move about freely, the molecules
of each metal tend to segregate, and to group themselves into separate crystals as the
