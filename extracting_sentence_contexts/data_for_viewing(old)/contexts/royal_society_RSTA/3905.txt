it is feasible to deliver given the technological and scientific upheavals, as well as the cultural and
societal feature of a given environment. Recalling the MAS described in §4, these changes ensure
the adaptability of the MAS and hence its resilience in delivering the right ethical framework for
the development of open, pluralistic, and just societies over time, responding to the changes faced
by the environment.

When considered within the dynamics of our MAS, the tension between individual privacy
and data philanthropy described in §3 shows to be operational, it is about the way we satisfy
this right, and not ontological, for the two are not incompatible. Hence, while individual privacy =
remains a fundamental value of information societies, the possibilities of re-identification of data : 3
subjects pose an operational limit to the ability of the infraethical agents to facilitate the task of
the ethical ones. A trade-off between the two agents will not leave the MAS in a better situation, mea)
in fact it may risk stalling it. The solution relies in considering how to use the rest of the agents :
of the MAS, both ethical and infraethical, to solve the tension. In this scenario, collaboration with a]
infraethical agents of oversight and auditing of the impact of the shared data, for example, would DNS
offer a more effective solution. aon

6. Conclusion

Philanthropy has often been related to altruism and kindness [32,63] and, as such, it has been
described as morally good action, which

extends through a wide range of social behaviour—from the informal expression of
kindness to a dependent at one end, to legislative campaigning for social justice at the other
[31, p. 181].
