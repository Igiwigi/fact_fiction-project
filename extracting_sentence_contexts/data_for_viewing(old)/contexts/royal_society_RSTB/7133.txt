(1940) found similar variations demonstrated by the deposits of an old lake basin in
Eire. These variations in deposition rate in lakes in glaciated areas must presumably be
due to indirect climatic effects; partly to the decrease in readily transported debris as the
post-glacial climatic amelioration led to stabilization of the land surface by a plant cover,
and partly to the effects of erosion and deposition by wind-produced currents in the water.
The effect of these variations is to complicate the interpretation of the pollen diagrams and
make it necessary to consider profiles from many parts of the lake before drawing any
conclusions about either the relative length of the successive phases of forest history and
the climatic periods which they indicate, or the relation of the stratigraphy of the deposits
to the time-scale provided by forest history.

Derived pollen from the boulder clay has been shown to be present in lacustrine clay
beds in Denmark (Iversen 1936), but in view of the fact that no more than an occasional
grain of pollen has been found in the Windermere lower laminated clay, which presumably
contains redeposited boulder clay, it is probable that there is very little derived pollen in
the succeeding deposits.

GENERAL STRATIGRAPHY (NOTES ADDITIONAL TO 1943 PAPER)

(1) Laminated clays

The appearance of the laminated clays forming the lower part of the deposits suggests
strongly that the laminations represent varves, or annual laminations formed by the
seasonal deposition from glacial drainage into standing water. They could therefore be
compared with the Swedish varved clays, deposited by the Scandinavian ice-sheet in a
