The early pteridospermous seeds certainly terminated branches,

* Tanstey (1908), p.6. This idea had been previously put forward by Lianrer (1908) on general grounds,
but Tanstey produced good anatomical evidence to substantiate it.

+ Gr√©corre (1931) has arrived at the same conclusion on other evidence.


256 H. HAMSHAW THOMAS ON SOME PTERIDOSPERMOUS PLANTS

even though these may be regarded as segments of large foliar structures, but when we
come to consider the morphology of the inflorescence of the Corystospermacez we find
facts of considerable interest. The seed-bearing structures of this group have been
described above as inflorescences instead of as sporophylls, though they were mainly
branched in one plane and often show a slight difference between the cuticles on the
upper and lower sides. But in the Angiosperms and other seed plants, structures
which are subtended by leaves or bracts are always regarded as branches rather than
leaves, and in the Corystospermacee the seed-bearing structures are constantly subtended
by bracts.
