This author, from the point of view of the characters which he examined also regards
the Abietinese as the most ancient group of the Coniferales.* We cannot now extend
our survey to the other families in this class, but we venture to suggest that the
position of the Araucariese might be more clearly and accurately expressed by
separating them from the other members of the group under the designation
Araucariales, a subdivision of the Gymnosperms including the recent genera Araucaria
and Agathis with such extinct types which there is good reason to believe are
related to these survivals from the past. The great antiquity of the southern floras
has long been recognised, and in citing the Cycads and the Araucariez as examples
of survivals from the past, Sir Witttam TuiseLton-Dyert expresses a fact which
we believe to be amply supported by the testimony of the rocks. In the existing
species of Araucaria and Agathis, we have remnants of a group of Gymnosperms which
once flourished north of the Equator and occupied a position in the vegetation of the
world from which they have been deposed by less ancient members of the Coniferales.

In conclusion we would point out that our position in relation to the question of
the phylogeny of the Araucariez is that of advocates of a view which has received
support in the past, but has of late hardly been accorded its due share of attention.
Further discoveries among the extinct types preserved in Paleozoic rocks may prove
us in the wrong; but if the arguments advanced are shown to be unequal to the
task of supporting the hypothesis that some at least of the Conifers are not offshoots
of a Filicinean stock, they may on the other hand do something to confirm the
