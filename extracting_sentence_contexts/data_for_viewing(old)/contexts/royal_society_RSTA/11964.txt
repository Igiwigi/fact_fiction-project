In our case, where the rise in temperature was always small and regular, ten or
twelve observations were considered sufficient to determine the constants, and in
that case the labour of reduction is small.

After an experiment the change in temperature of the calorimeter had to be
observed once more, and a value k’ corresponding to & was again determined in a
similar manner. From the two values k and k’ the loss of heat of the calorimeter
during the whole of the experiment could easily be calculated, for the rise in
temperature during the actual heating was uniform. If the current passed during 7
intervals, each equal to T, and if — % and —k’ denote the rates of cooling during the
first and last periods, the loss of heat during the m intervals was 4m(k-+ 4%’). A
small correction was necessary owing to the fact that the observed values of k and k’
did not correspond to the temperature of the calorimeter at the beginning and end of
the second period.

We have now to examine shortly how far errors in the estimation of the cooling
correction may arise. Nrwron’s law of cooling is known to be approximate only. If

we had to deal simply with radiation, we should obtain greater accuracy by adopting
the law of Srmray, according to which radiation varies as the fourth power of the
absolute temperature. We have calculated that the difference introduced by SrTeran’s
law in the final value of the equivalent amounts to about one part in sixty thousand,
and considering that the combined effect of radiation and conduction seems to follow
Nerwron’s law more closely than the effect of radiation alone, we are justified in
