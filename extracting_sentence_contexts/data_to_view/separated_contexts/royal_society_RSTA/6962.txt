The hydroxy]
group is in a nearly terminal position, and a double layer would be expected, as
observed, rather different in character from the normal variety. Cholestane-6-ol ELCOH
is, on the other hand, exceedingly similar morphologically to cholesterol H,O. It is,
in fact, the only derivative in the table that might on cursory inspection be mistaken
for cholesterol H,O. The crystal structure in both cases is of an irregular and com-
plicated variety from which it is impossible to expect to draw exact conclusions at this
stage. And while a very natural deduction from the direct comparison of the two
structures would certainly be that in both the hydroxyl group is at C3, one fact, the
further doubling of the Â¢ dimension in cholesterol H,O compared with cholestane-6-ol,
is against it.
