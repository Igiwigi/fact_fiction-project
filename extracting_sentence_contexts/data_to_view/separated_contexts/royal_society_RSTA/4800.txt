The brine flux predicted by this model is shown as a function of time in figure 1. In comparison,
the dashed curve shows the prediction of a zero-layer Semtner model with the same boundary
conditions, with brine fluxes determined by assuming a fixed ice salinity of 4ppt. The very
close agreement between these two models at late times is coincidental and unexpected given
the approximate nature of the examples chosen here for illustration and the fact that the two
calculations give rather different predictions (not shown) of the thickness of sea ice as a function
of time. However, the correspondence of the functional forms predicted is relevant and indicates
that the convective model can be tuned to give similar long-term trends as a fixed-salinity model
for a given scenario.

7. Discussion and conclusion

Brine drainage from sea ice is a complex process involving interactions between fluid flow in a
porous medium and phase change that affects the fluid-mechanical properties of the medium.
