Before giving quantitative examples, taken from actual ships, of the
maximum sagging-strains that may occur in this position, it will be only proper to call
attention also to the obviously great increase in the maximum shearing-forces which a
ship then experiences. Roughly speaking, we may say that one half a ship's weight is
taken at the bow, and the other half at the stern when the middle is unsupported ; 80
that near the points of support the shearing-force is approximately one half the ship's
weight. In preceding investigations it has been shown that for still water the shearing-
force has an approximate maximum value of 4; part of the total weight; and that for

Support on a wavye-crest the shearing-force probably does not exceed + part of the total
weight; hence the above-mentioned fact, as to the increase of shearing-strains in a ship
' _ ashore, becomes obvious. The quantitative examples which have been chosen to illustrate the maximum strains
incidental to suspension by the ends only are based upon the three typical ships pre-
viously considered, viz. the * Minotaur,” the © Bellerophon,” and the © Victoria and Albert.”
As the result of calculations made for the * Minotaur,” it has been found that the centre
of gravity of the ship, when fully laden, is 210 feet from the bow, and that when he rests
upon the extremities the upward pressure at! the bow equals 4925 tons, while that at
the stern equals 4975 tons. 'These quantities obviously give the limiting values for the

Sshearing-forces experienced by the ship. Next, as to the maximum bending-moment,
which will be experienced by the transverse section of the ship that contains her centre
Sof gravity.
