qeurons innervating a limb muscle, ¢.g., flexor brevis, hallucis, or pollicis, is composed
gf individual neurons, belonging not merely to one but to two and three adjacent
‘ppinal segments.* From the above it is clear that the rule of segmental proximity
Hoes not operate to the extent of making motor neurons belonging to one segment in
‘Zhe pluri-segmental motor nucleus greatly more accessible by its own afferent root
‘Shan are by that root the motor neurons of the other segments composing the
sag in fact they are only very slightly if in any degree more so. Here
‘again facts lend no countenance to the assertion that the collection of fibres in
Bach motor root represents one highly co-ordinate functional synergy. On the
‘Sontrary they indicate that not the whole motor root, but particular fractional
~tombinations of several motor roots are, in spinal reflex actions, to be considered
Anits. The afferent channels of the cord treat the pluri-segmental motor stations
Sr nuclei of these limb muscles as entities of homogeneous structure, as in fact

Physiological units.

3 From the foregoing it follows naturally that the reflex centrifugal discharge
of the spinal cord is pluri-segmental, The rule may be stated thus: in response to
Beeitation even approximately minimal of a single afferent root, or even of a single
sig of a single afferent root, the spinal discharge of centrifugal impulses evoked,
mds to occur vit more than one efferent root, i.e., is pluri-segmental. It is
interesting to note that this is more strongly the case in the limbs than in the
thoracic region where the segments are less commingled. The segmental arrange-
ment of the motor cells of the spinal cord is said by Scuwapet to be more obvious
in the thoracic than in the limb regions. But in the limb region, the arrangement, if
