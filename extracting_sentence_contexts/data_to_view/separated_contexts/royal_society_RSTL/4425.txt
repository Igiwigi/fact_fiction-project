guard or rostrum), I would remark, that since my former communication I have in-
spected many hundred specimens from various localities, and have ascertained that
although in detached examples (the ordinary condition in which thege fossils occur)
the rostrum appears to terminate by a well-defined line at the upper part, yet this is
