Tt is Als possible lo obtaite tle same expression for y by mlegrating the simplest of
the fondamental hydrodyonmical equations of Navies (*Mém. Acad. des Seiauees,'
vol. §, 1822), alter malting the assnmptions that when « permauent current of lignid

If, inateud of considexing a tube of indefinite length, and the loss of pressure taking
place between isyo sevhions of sich a tube, we teal with a system consisting of two
reservoirs, connected by x tobe of finite length, the difference of pressure measured
being that bethyeen the tio reservoirs, then the above formula will ti general not apply
tniless suitable corrections bea introduced, This arises from the fact that the observed
