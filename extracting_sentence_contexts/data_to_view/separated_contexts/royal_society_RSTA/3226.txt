Becqueret was the first to show that when two metallic plates are immersed in a
liquid, and one is exposed to light while the other is kept in the dark, an E.M.F. is
created. Which now is the nature of this E.M.F.? Brcqurret’s and Mincuin’s (more
especially the latter's) experiments brought to our knowledge peculiar facts, which
all seemed to indicate that the above phenomena are surface phenomena, and strongly
to oppose the author's conception of such systems as galvanic cells. What were now
these observations of BecqueREL and Mincuin? According to BrcquerEeL: “ by
depositing on one of the Ag plates a thin layer of iodide, obtained by the action of
the vapour of iodine at the ordinary temperature and then exposing this plate to
light, it was found that it took positive electricity from the liquid.
