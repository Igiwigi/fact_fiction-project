The absence in slow Enhydrina
poisoning of the large asphyxial rises of pressure, which are so characteristic of the
final stages of Cobra poisoning, is readily explained by the fact that Enhydrina
venom has no direct constrictive action on the walls of the arterioles, such as Cobra
venom possesses.

(7) As to the part of the respiratory mechanism that is affected by Sea-snake
venom, the rapidity with which respiration is modified, both when venom is injected
into a vein and also when it is applied directly to the medulla oblongata, leaves no
room to doubt that the respiratory centre is directly acted on by the venom. On
the other hand, we have shown that some degree of motor nerve-end paresis is
constantly present in animals dying from the effects of subcutaneous injections of this
venom. We have also emphasised the fact that in our experiments carried out by
dropping venom on the exposed medulla oblongata, we have failed to kill animals
through the respiratory centre with the motor nerve-ends still undamaged. In this
respect we have shown that Enhydrina venom differs in its action from Cobra venom,
It would, therefore, appear that in poisoning with Enhydrina venom, motor nerve-
end paresis plays a much greater part than it does in cobraism. It is not difficult to
suppose that a blunting of the motor nerve-end mechanism, even though far from
absolute, may seriously add to the embarrassment of a centre which has already been
directly and gravely damaged.
