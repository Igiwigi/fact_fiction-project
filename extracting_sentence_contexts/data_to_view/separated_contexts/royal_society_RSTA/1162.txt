It is possible that Uranus and Neptune formed much closer to the Sun, and even switched
positions! (e.g. Thommes et al. [29]; Tsiganis et al. [30]). This can partially resolve the formation

1With Neptune originally being closer to the Sun than Uranus, which could be supported by the fact that Neptune is slightly
more massive than Uranus.


time scale problem of Uranus and Neptune (e.g. Helled & Bodenheimer [28]). However,
a calculation that includes the planetary growth, accounting for the heavy-elements self-
consistently, and that can lead to the predicted Hâ€”-He-to-heavy elements ratios of either planet
is still missing.

A distinct feature of Uranus is its axial tilt.
