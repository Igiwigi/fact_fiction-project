The posterior lobe, on the other hand, is composed mainly
of a tissue which resembles nerve grey matter, with many glia cells and, according
to some authorities, a few nerve fibres and some scattered nerve cells; it consists,
in fact, to all appearance of neuroglia with, perhaps, some nerve tissue, as the mode
of its formation from the floor of the third ventricle might lead one to expect. There is, however, a layer of vascular epithelial tissue covering the part of the lobe
where it abuts on the intraglandular cleft before noticed, the more superficial cells
being arranged somewhat like the cells of a columnar epithelium. This epithelial
layer passes at the edges of the intraglandular cleft into continuity with the
epithelial tissue of the anterior lobe—of which, in fact, it appears to be an extension ;
it probably belongs to the hypophysial part of the gland, and the intraglandular
cleft—which is not present in all animals—is also wholly hypophysial.* The
cleft itself is occupied by a small amount of glairy fluid,} which is probably secreted
by the cells which bound the cleft. It is difficult to determine whether there is
any difference in activity of an extract made from the anterior layer of the posterior
lobe, which includes this epithelial structure, and from the middle and the posterior
parts of the lobe where there is apparently nothing but neuroglial tissue. All that
can be said on this point is that we have obtained a very active extract from the
part of the posterior lobe which is furthest removed from the epithelial layer and
the intraglandular cleft, so that the production of an active substance seems not to
be bound up with the presence of epithelium in that lobe.} :
