yr yf =alt) + QHYy — yo),

where yo is an arbitrary fixed point. y and y’ are the places of the same material element recorded,
respectively, by two observers O and 0’. They differ from one another by the rigid-body motion
just defined, characterized by translation a(t) and rotation Q(t). By computing the time derivative
of y’ and pulling back from 0’ to O the velocity i, we define a new velocity j/* to be

i =Q'y =clt) +q() x Y—yo) +h, (6.1)

a standard relation in which c := Q!a and q is the axial vector of the skew-symmetric tensor Qa.

Changing coordinates in the physical space alters also the perception of the microstructures,
which are, in fact, in that space, within the deformed configuration, once u has been applied.
Their separate representation on the manifold M is just a model choice, which must account the
physical perception of the body. For this reason, we define a link between changes in observers in
the physical space, determined in general by elements of Diff(E°, €°), the space of one-to-one
differentiable maps with differentiable inverse (diffeomorphisms in short) of €° onto itself—
rotations and translations are special cases—and transformations of the atlas on the manifold M,
given by elements of Diff(M, M), the group of diffeomorphism mapping M onto itself. Formally,
the link we imagine is given by a family of differentiable homomorphisms

(a: Diff(E3, E2) — Diff, M)},

which can be even empty. We do not need to render explicit 4 for constructing a general model-
building framework. The specific choice of 4 depends on the special cases we explore every time.
