solution of the zinc, is s00n placed in the same condition as the other parts, and the

whole plate rendered superficially uniform. One part cannot, therefore, act as a
discharger to another ; and hence all the chemical power upon the water at its surface
is in that equable condition (949.), which, though it tends to produce an electric cur-
rent through the liquid to another plate of metal which can act as a discharger (950.),
presents no irregularities by which any one part, having weaker affinities for oxygen,
can act as a discharger to another. 'Two excellent and important consequences fol-
low upon this state of the metal. The first is, that the full equivalent of electricity is
