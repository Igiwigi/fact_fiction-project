K-satellites of these metals, as determined by Karlsson and Siegbahn (1934). The
energy difference between the line satellite K(L.;) L, and the emission edge of the band
satellite K(L,,) V, which can both be unambiguously identified, gives the absolute
quantum energy of a postulated L,(L,,) V satellite; and the agreement with the
observed energy of the short wave-length L-bands was found to be very good. This
appears to settle definitely the identity of these bands as satellites. We shall not enter
here into the question of why such K and LZ satellites, which represent emission from
atoms in abnormal states, show features similar to, though not identical with, those of
the K- or L,-emission bands themselves; thus for metals, the satellite bands show sharp
emission edges as we have mentioned, and in general the total band widths are the
same as those of the main bands.*

The important fact from the present point of view is that we have established that
the Z,-bands are not found in sufficient strength to be observable, and that their
intensity is therefore only a fraction of 1 °%, of that of the L,-bands. This implies that
when an L,-shell is ionized in the X-ray tube, the vacancy is almost immediately
filled by a process which does not provide radiation in our region of the spectrum.
Obviously, the most natural process to be considered is the transition L, or L, > Ly.
If this process occurred with the emission of radiation, this would lie in the region of
1000 A. We have not made any systematic search, but it is almost certain that if this
radiation can be found, it must be very weak. Owing to its small quantum energy,
a process such as L, > L, is much more likely to occur with the emission of an Auger
electron. Of course, it is implied that there exists a level into which the Auger electron
can make its transition, but this condition is certainly satisfied even for free atoms,
provided the energy difference (L,—> L,) is sufficiently great, and is always likely to
