Received June 18, —Read June 18, 1857 *. Pug fact that the skin of the frog is capable of varying in colour, has been for some
known to- German naturalists. 'The first account of the mechanism by which these

ges are effected, appears to haye been given by Professor Broke, of Vienna, in
2852+, and the subject has since been yery carefully investigated by Dr. vox WrrTmIcn
Sf Konigsbergf, and Dr. E. HarLess of Munichh. All these observers describe the
Hark pigment as contained in stellate cells, each composed of a central part or body and
eral tubular offsets, which, subdividing minutely and anastomosing freely with one
Smother and also with those of neighbouring cells, constitute a delicate network in the
Substance of the true skin.
