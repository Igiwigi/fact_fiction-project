You will remember that in my account of the construction of the constant battery * I
attributed the precipitation of the copper from the sulphate to * the deoxidating
power of the nascent hydrogen ;‚Äù but from the first I have been generally struck with
the beautiful crystalline arrangement and close compact structure of the metallic de-
posit. This is 80 remarkable, that in the first small sheet of copper which I stripped
from a platinum electrode, and which is now in my possession, I noticed that the
Scratches of the file, which the latter bore, were perfectly moulded upon it. This is
unlike what one would have expected, & priori, from the precipitation of a metal, by a

we now know to be the fact, the immediate deposit of the metallic cathion upon the
platinode without the intervention of the gas. I had also remarked, at times, without
being able to account for it, that the texture of the copper was spongy and little co-
herent. The beautiful application of this observation by Professor Jacost and Mr.
