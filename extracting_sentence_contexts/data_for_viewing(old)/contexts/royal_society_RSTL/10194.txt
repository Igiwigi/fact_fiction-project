2 Taking Siphonogorgic as a form intermediate between the ancestral type and the
3 true Gorgonide, we find that the chief diversion lies in the fact that the colony has
ES, assumed an arborescent shape, and a support for ib is produced by a more copious
& development of spicules in the axial portions of the colony. The body-cavities of the
8. polyps, however, remain long, as they were in the ancestral form. Most probably
= there was another stage between Siphonogorgia and this ancestral form which was
S not dimorphic. From Siphonogorgia, Paragorgia differs chiefly in the fact that the
=D body-cavities of the polyps have become reduced in length, and a complicated system
S of canals occupies the position which they formerly occupied. If Corallium is
Â£ dimorphic, as RipLEy (19) and Mosgrey (16) consider it to be, it was derived from
S an ancestor similar to Paragorgia in which, by a fusion of the spicules, a solid rod
occupies the axis of the colony. The rare genus Pleurocorallium differs from
Corallium in the fact that the polyps are not retracted into the ecnenchym, but
this condition may be simply due to a more copious development of spicules in the
walls of the polyps, thereby offering a physical difficulty to the retraction of the polyps.
Passing by the form which I suppose at one time existed similar to Siphonogorgia
but not dimorphie, we should obtain such forms as Briarers, in which the body-
cavities of the polyps are shorb ; there is no solid axis and no dimorphism, and from
such genera, Celogorgia, Solenogorgia, &e., might be obtained by the development of
large canals in the axis of the colony, or again by the development of horny or cal-
careous axes, we should obtain the remaining families of Gorgonacte, Primnoacere, &e.
