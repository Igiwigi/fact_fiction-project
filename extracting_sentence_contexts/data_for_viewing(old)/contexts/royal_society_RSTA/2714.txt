Figure 2. Bifurcation diagram showing the UV branch (black), the Turing branch with wavelength A; (blue) and insets near
the folds of the Turing branch with branches of modulated states (red) corresponding to allowed spatial modulations on a half-
domain of length 2.54.7 and NBCs. There are in fact six such branches but C,D have nearly the same norm as the others as do E,F.
Solution profiles B(x) (green) and W(x) (blue) near the upper fold (a = 1.0225, left) and lower fold (a = 0.98, right) are also
shown. The red dotted lines indicate the maximum and minimum values of B(x) for the corresponding stable Turing solution to
help with the detection of the modulation. Parameters: d = 7,m = 0.5 and / = 2.5A,. Temporally stable (unstable) sections
of the UV and Turing branches are marked with thick solid (thin dashed) lines while stability of the modulated states is not
indicated. (Online version in colour.)

3. Bifurcation structure of periodic states and mixed modes

We first examine the properties of the Turing branch, ie. the branch of spatially PPs with
wavelength Ap =22/kr (blue curve) that bifurcates from the UV* branch at a=ar (figure 2,
middle panel). We see that the branch undergoes two successive folds and that it extends in a
below the UV fold. As already explained we expect to see bifurcations to spatially modulated
