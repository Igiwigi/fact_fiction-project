The degree of trait overlap between conspecific and het-
erospecific potential mates upon secondary contact will
determine whether or not there will be selection for divergent
signal traits. When species trait distributions do not overlap,
the evolution of an acceptance threshold will not generate
selection for further divergence in traits. In fact, acceptance
thresholds may be more likely to evolve along trait axes
that have the least overlap between incipient species because
this would result in lower probability of false acceptance. Thus, reinforcement may often fail to result in reproductive
character displacement simply because selection will favour
the use of non-overlapping cues for species recognition [23]. Note that phenotypes may be similar without overlapping
in distribution (based on the sensory systems of the organ-
isms), as may be the case in myriad examples of cryptic
species that maintain reproductive isolation despite apparent
phenotypic similarity (e.g. [28,29]).
