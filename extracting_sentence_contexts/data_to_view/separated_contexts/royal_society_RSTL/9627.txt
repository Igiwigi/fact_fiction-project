If we put y=1 in (284), we have
aW ,4W 27?

de Tde' a(l—1)? SEAS). - 1! 51-1; Lan

Where & means summation for i, 1, ii, iv. This result follows from the fact that in all the E-terms of W, e& and &' enter in
the form le+ ma", where [+m=2. In the F*-terms xy enters in the form 2y,, and is of the opposite sign from I+m ; in
the F,-terms it enters in the form 2x, and is of the same sign as [+1 ; in the G*-terms
it enters in the form x", and is of the opposite sign from 1m ; in the Geterms it
enters in the form x, and is of the same sign as {+m. Hence as far as regards the E-terms of W, we have

in the F*-terms = a2 Ee =)
in the F,-terms = mm ad
Gon = KT)

in the H-terms =;——0

In the J-terms of W, x enters with coefficient 2 in the F*- and F,-terms, and with
the coefficient 1 in the G*- and Gterms, and is always of the same sign as the
corresponding lag.
