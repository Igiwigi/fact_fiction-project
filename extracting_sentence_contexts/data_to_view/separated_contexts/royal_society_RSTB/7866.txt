The lumina of the right and left uterine horns remain distinct for some distance beyond
the point where the horns themselves fuse, as is shown, for instance, in figure 4, and then
open by simple orifices into a common lumen in the body of the uterus. In pregnant
animals it was found that the embryo was usually situated in that part of the uterus where
the horns are fused but where the right and left lumina are distinct. That this is the usual
site of implantation was confirmed by the fact that in many lactating animals the site of
a former placental attachment could be seen in this region. Within the uterine horn the lumen gradually increases in diameter as it progresses
towards the junction of the right and left horns, and the surrounding muscle layer becomes
