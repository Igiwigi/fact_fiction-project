It would thus appear probable that after the 13 years' application of ammonia-salts
to plot 6, 8ome at any rate of the supplied nitrogen remained within the 80il, and that
some of this was available to the growing plants during the 8ucceeding seven years. But that as much was taken up as where the ammonia-salts were still annually
applied would seem to require some further explanation. In reference to this point we have the significant fact, as will be fully illustrated
further on, that the surface s0il of plot 6 showed at the end of the 20 years—thab is,
after the mineral manures had been applied for seven years—a notably lower per-
centage of nitrogen than the corresponding layer of plot 5 ; thus pointing to a source
of nitrogen to the plants similar to that which is s8upposed to have contributed to the
high nitrogenous yield of plot 7, where the mineral manures alone, including potass,
had been applied throughout the 20 years. It remains to consider whether, not only
the conditions of manuring, but the characters of the vegetation, were also consistent
with, in great measure, a similar 8ource of nitrogen in the two cases. EXPERIMENTS ON THE MIXED HERBAGE OF PERMANENT MEADOW. 355

Tt will be remembered that on plot 5, with ammonia-salts alone, the herbage became
more and more gramineous, contained scarcely any leguminous plants, and, with the
exception of Rumer acetosa, very little of any miscellaneous 8pecies.
