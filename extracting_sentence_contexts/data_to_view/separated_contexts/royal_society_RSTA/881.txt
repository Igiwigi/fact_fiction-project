The coefficient of friction was also found to be inde-
pendent of the diameter of the sphere used for the rubbing contact. Table X shows
the results for a number of new steel balls of different sizes. The fact that the coefficient of friction is independent of the curvature of the
rubbing contacts also shows that there is no disturbing viscosity effect in the measure-
ments of boundary lubrication. With all measurements of boundary lubrication,
some abrasion of the surfaces took place, the spherical contacts were worn, and

there were slight marks on the flat bearing surface. This abrasion occurred with
surfaces which were apparently well lubricated and for which the coefficient of
friction was considerably lower than that reported for static friction.
