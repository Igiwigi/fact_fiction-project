Figure 9. Green and black areas measurements: SERS spectra of (a) green earth (Y4-23) and (6) carbon black (Y4-24).

Raman spectra from KNO3 present a strong band near 1055cm7! which can be misinterpreted
as lead white. Another band is produced by the nanoparticle colloidal silver at 240 cm7! that can
sometimes be detected in SERS analysis.

Resolution and other instrument characteristics of portable spectrometers are usually lower
than those of bench-top equipment and this may result in slightly different spectra. Taking this
fact into account, the spectra of the panel paintings were always compared with the spectra of
the pure pigments and dyes, and to those reported in the literature, in order to ensure correct
interpretation.

As discussed before, almost two-thirds of the painted areas were damaged to some extent by
the 20 mW 785 nm laser. Of those, the application of HERAS avoided or reduced the damages in
all cases, but provided good quality information only in six cases: yellow ochre, fawn ochre, red
iron oxide, indigo, green earth and carbon black.

4. Conclusion

In situ studies of a painting are difficult because of its complex composition and the numerous
materials used in its elaboration. Raman spectroscopy provided information on the pigments as
