Conclusion

Cultural effects on embodiment are not clearly distinct from biological facts, in spite of what our academic division of labour
suggests. As Krieger argues, embodiment is literal [100]. The recognition of cultural variation in embodiment should prompt
cultural anthropologists and others to address the complex, multi-directional mechanisms that link social facts, behavioural
patterns and ideational constructs in diverse cultures with human phenotypic development. Ingold has observed, however, that
even those anthropologists who have accepted the ‘idea of embodiment as a paradigm for the study of culture’ and denounced
mind/body dualism often baulk at attempts to integrate biology into cultural research [17, p. 170]. Instead, ‘embodiment’ in


cultural anthropology tends to refer to the phenomenological fact of having a body rather than the physiological consequences
of patterned practice (e.g. [101]).
