This is a difference,
however, which merely indicates the higher state of development of the resin. tissues
and has no doubt been derived from the aggregation of the resin cells and the
degeneration of certain of the central ones, a feature which PENHALLOW (1907) has
already emphasised. â€˜That this has been the course of events in the pines is indicated
by the fact that the canals form at the cambium as solid masses of parenchyma and
that the traumatic canals of the pines are usually solid (figs. 61, 62, and 65, Plate 7)
Very often, too, this is their character in the cone axis (fig. 64, Plate 7). Again there
are many references to the so-called tylosed condition in the fossil forms, but until it
has been proven that these canals were ever open they must be considered as
originating and remaining solid.
