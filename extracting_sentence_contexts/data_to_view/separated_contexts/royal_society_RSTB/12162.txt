In 2014, Prondvai & Stein reconsidered the original func- cal literature over the past 15 years, together with observations
tion of purported MB in extinct archosaurs after observing from newly published data, to establish an updated checklist of
such tissues in the mandibular symphyses of several, suppo- 11 criteria that should be taken into account to clearly diagnose
sedly young pterosaur specimens. Considering the early MB. O'Connor et al. [46] attribute the first three criteria (#1-3)

ontogenetic stage of these animals, the fact that pterosaurs listed in their table 1 to the features traditionally recognized


in the literature as characteristic of MB. They propose eight (b) Criterion #2: â€˜be of endosteal origi '
additional criteria (#4-11) that are either based on their own

observations or on published data and suggest that to be
robustly diagnosed as MB, the tissue under investigation
must fulfill at least the first 9 (#1-9) out of 11 of their criteria. This list is meant to summarize the most inclusive knowl-
edge of avian MB to date, and the validity of each criterion,
when applied to fossil specimens, will be considered as a
baseline for our following discussion.
