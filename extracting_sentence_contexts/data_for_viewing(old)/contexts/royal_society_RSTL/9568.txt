60 MR. W. BEVAN LEWIS ON THE COMPARATIVE

RELATIVE INCREASE OF ConnectlVE MATRIX.

Examination of the brain of animals below Man in the scale of organization shows
in a strikirg manner that the comparative amount of connective to nerve elements is
greatly increased. This fact TI have already drawn attention to in discussing the rela-
tive and absolute depth of the first layer of the cortex in different animalsâ€”a layer
which in all cases essentially consists of a larger amount of connective than the 8nb-
jacent strata.* MeyNErr also gives a table illustrative of this point. Independent
of the increase in relative and absolute depth of this layer, we have by these investi-
gations been taught to recognise a great increass in the quantity of the cellular
constituent of this matrix in the form of Derrer's corpuscles, which crowd the upper
regions of this layer. In Man they appear in scanty numbers ; in the Barbary Ape
they become more frequent ; in the Cat and Ocelob they are still more abundant; in
the Pig and Sheep $0 profusely scattered are they that they form a most characteristic
stratum immediately below the pia mater, and the meshwork formed by their fibres is
dense and coarse, binding the blood-vessels to the cortex and rendering the pia mater
strongly adherent (Plate 6). We find these corpuscles more freely in human brain
