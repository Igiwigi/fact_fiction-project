In accord with facts 1 and 2, ug changes a| t) + A] |) into
a|t) +e” B| |). However, the same ug acting on S in an entangled state |se) does not matter for
S alone, as it can be undone by 1s ® (let er| +e” ley Ney), a countershift acting on a faraway,
decoupled €. As the global |Ws¢) is restored, by fact 3 the local state of S is also restored even if
S is not acted upon (so that, by fact 1, it remains unchanged). Hence, the local state of decohered
S that one obtains from |s¢) could not have changed to begin with, and so it cannot depend on
the phases of a and p. The only pure states invariant under such phase shifts (unaffected by decoherence) are pointer
states.
