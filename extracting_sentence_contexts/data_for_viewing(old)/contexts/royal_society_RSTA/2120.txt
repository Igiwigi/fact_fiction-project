encounter will make them effectively lose all their energy, and they will become trapped. The first
material encountered in any collider experiment is the beam pipe. Hence, a campaign has been
started to try to obtain the beam pipes from the LHC experiments so that they can be analysed.
The first of these is from one of the CMS experiments (run 1), which was handed over to MoEDAL
on 18/2/2019. This beam pipe is now being analysed in a similar way to the MMT material, i.e.
by using a hyper-sensitive SQUID magnetometer that is capable of detecting single Dirac charged
monopoles in the material.


3. New experiments at the Large Hadron Collider

The studies of ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and MoEDAL for LLPs have not led to the discovery of a
positive signal yet. While these studies were ongoing it was also realized that, in fact, the present
LHC detectors could have very low detection for a number of LLP scenarios, or even totally
miss them. This has led to proposals for possible new small-scale additional experiments for the
LHC, to cover these possible gaps. Indeed, the LHC will continue to run and produce protonâ€”
proton (and nucleus-nucleus) collisions for another 20 years or so, with increasing luminosity
performance with time. Hence, it is an excellent time now to reflect on which experiments should
be undertaken now to prevent any regrets over missed opportunities in the future. Examples of
such newly proposed projects are MilliQan [9], MATHUSLA [10], CODEX-b [11], AL3X [12] and
FASER [13]. Four of these experiment proposals are shown in figure 6. In a way, the MoEDAL
experiment stands as a model for such initiatives: it is a detector targeting LLPs using a specially
chosen experimental technique. The collaboration contains typically fewer than a 100 people,
compared with around 3000 people for the large LHC experiments. The budget is of the order
of a few million US dollars, about 1% of the budget of ATLAS or CMS. The new initiatives are
