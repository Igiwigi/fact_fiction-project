he loosened it slightly. In neither case was the slightest trace of oedema
in the hand,* while the only place where cedema was visible was immediatel
the ligature in my friend’s arm for a distance of one inch downwards. In experiny

small amount of cedema in the neighbourhood of the ligature. I afterwards 0
Votrrant speaks of the same appearance “ first of all in the thigh, later int

An additional point of interest which showed itself in the experiments on (
that a certain amount of cedema almost invariably appeared on the proxi
the ligature. The amount was never as great as that on the distal side, b
very evident, and pitted deeply on pressure. Reference to this fact will |
later. It is sufficient here to state that careful dissection showed that the parts
the ligature did not drain into a vein which opened into the main trunk on the
side of the ligature, and hence that the cedematous parts above the ligature
the seat of venous obstruction.

* In my friend’s hand there was perhaps a doubtful trace, but it disappeared a few mij
