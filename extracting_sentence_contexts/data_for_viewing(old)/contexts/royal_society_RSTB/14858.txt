the way things actually are, they also understand how com-
munication works via the signalling of the way that things
might be. Indeed, young children’s early sharing of

information about possibilities suggests that they are likely
to heed, engage with, and trust informants who are not
making straightforward factual assertions and continue to
do so even when those assertions are not accurate descrip-
tions of current reality (as in the context of pretend play
and fictional stories), or may prove to be false (as in the con-
text of opinions about non-immediate possibilities). In
summary, children’s early participation in communication is
not confined to the transmission of known facts. From an
early age, it also includes requests for, and the provision of,
information about possibilities—alongside the world of
known facts.

The available comparative evidence indicates that this
early-emerging human capacity is not observed in great
apes—although further comparative and cross-cultural
research is needed to firmly establish such a cross-species
claim [40]. Granted that children can contemplate and share
possibilities and do so well before they respond optimally
on the forked tubes task (i.e. with two hands), it will also
be important to probe how this early-emerging capacity is
