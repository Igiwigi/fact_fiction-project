So Eve cannot be in the main lobe of the channel,
otherwise she can be easily visible, and hence it is reasonable to assume that Eveâ€™s channel can be
physically bounded. Under such an assumption, one may pursue higher transmission rate than
that of QKD. In fact, long distance FSO channels are usually very lossy, and a key rate of QKD
becomes very small. We first review our theory of physical layer security and its implementation
in FSO communications system [14] and then present our experimental results with a 7.8km
terrestrial FSO wiretap channel.

2. Theory of physical layer security

In this section, we focus on secret message transmission in a wiretap channel.
