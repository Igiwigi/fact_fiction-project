A second
consequence is cryptic fractionation. At mid-
ocean ridges, a plagioclase framework may already
have formed when clinopyroxene saturates. As a
result, clinopyroxene phenocrysts are rare, despite
the fact that the vast majority of MORB records
clinopyroxene fractionation. Hence, melts extracted
