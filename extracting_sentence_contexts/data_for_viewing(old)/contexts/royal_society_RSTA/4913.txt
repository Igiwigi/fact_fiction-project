4. Lifetime

To account for the flat filter ratios and overdensities, it was suggested that EUV loops might be
heated impulsively and cooling through the TRACE passbands [21]. This premise implied that the
observed loop would appear in the hotter channel images before appearing in the cooler channel
images. Figure 4 shows a light curve for a cooling TRACE loop [22]. The loop appears first in the
TRACE 284-A channel, the warmest of the TRACE channels, which is centred on an Fe XV line
with a peak formation temperature of log T = 6.4. Later, the loop appears in the 195-A channel,
the intermediate temperature channel, which is centred on an Fe XII line with a peak formation
temperature of log T = 6.1. Finally, the loop appears in the 171-A channel, the lowest temperature
channel, which is centred on an Fe IX line with a peak formation temperature of log T = 5.9. These
types of lightcurves indicate that the loops are in fact cooling, as predicted [21].

Since the response functions of the EUV channels cover a range of temperatures, it was
required to make some (reasonable) assumptions to estimate both the observed lifetime and
the predicted cooling time of the loops [22,23]. They estimate that the appearance of the loop
in a given channel corresponds to the time when the intensity of the loop becomes greater than
