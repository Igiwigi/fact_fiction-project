210 (Bope) Cygni which I bave just measured is difficult enough ; it is however
easy when compared with this. My confidence in the accuracy of these results is
but little. Night at present tolerably fayourable,

* The tar here measured is not IV. 24, in spite of the general agreement of their
angles. The descriptions are totally at variance ; and in the MS. there is a remark,
« My 24th tar in class IV. is miscalled ; it should be Fx, 46® Cygni (s*) adjacens,
or ad 46 am Cygni;” «3 Cygni is in fact IV. 23. (H).
