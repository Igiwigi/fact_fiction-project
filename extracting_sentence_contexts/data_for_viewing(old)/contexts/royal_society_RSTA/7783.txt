spark spectrum of platinum. That failure was chiefly due to the lack of adequate
observations in the Schumann region. The spectrum should, of course, be similar to
Nin and Pdu, both of which were previously analysed in the laboratory, but in the
third long period the excitation energies have increased to such a point that the chief
lines of the transition 5d°6s—5d°6p are mainly below 42000. Their observation requires
a vacuum spectrograph, which we did not have at that time.

OBSERVATIONS

Down to the limit of transmission of air, the spectra of the arc and spark were photo-
graphed with the 21 ft. grating, and the wave-lengths were measured against iron
standards. It was found necessary to use graphite electrodes for the arc, because of the
fact that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to run an arc between pure platinum rods.
One is much more apt to get a glow discharge in which the cathode is hot, the anode
cold and the spectrum that of air. In the Schumann region also, arc-spark observations
were the chief source of the data. A modification of the method described by Selwyn
(1929) was used, and excellent spectra were obtained down to the fluorite limit at
41240. The modification ensures an image of the source at the slit and makes the
elimination of oxygen from the flowing nitrogen much more complete. The arc in pure
nitrogen runs at 10-15 V higher potential than it does in air, and produces the second
spark spectrum of some elements with considerable intensity. A diagram of the attach-
ment is shown in fig. 1. The spectrograph is of conventional type employing a glass
grating of 2 m. radius and 30,000 lines per inch. The spectrum can be photographed
from A500 to A2250. Hilger Schumann plates and Ilford Q plates were used, the latter
being practically perfect for the longer wave-lengths.
