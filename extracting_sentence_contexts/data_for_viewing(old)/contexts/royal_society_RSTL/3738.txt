We see here that the repulsion, when the line of pressure is axial, exceeds what
occurs when the same line is equatorial by fully one-half the amount of the latter.
Now this can only be due to the more intense magnetization, or rather diamagneti-
zation, of the bismuth along the line of pressure; and in the experiment now to be
described I availed myself of this fact to render the effect more decided.

The prisms of bismuth were s0 constructed that the line of pressure was parallel
to the length of each. The rectangular box before referred to was suspended from

its centre of gravity O in the magnetic field, 80 that the two prisms were in the same
horizontal plane. Let the position of the box thus
suspended horizontally be that shown in fig. 2.
For the sake of simplicity, we will confine our at-
tention to the action of one of the poles N, which
