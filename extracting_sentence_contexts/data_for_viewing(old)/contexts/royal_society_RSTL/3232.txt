OF FLUIDS ON VIBRATING ELASTIC SURFACES. 333

this paper) are in form, quality, and motion of their parts, the same with what
are called stationary undulations ; and if the mercury in a small circular basin
be tapped at the middle, stationary undulations, resembling the ring-like heaps
(83. 110), will be obtained; or if a rectangular frame be made to beat at equal
intervals of time on mercury or water, heaps like those of the crispations, ar-
ranged quadrangularly at angles of 45* to the frame, will be produced. These
effects are in fact the same with those described, but are produced by a cause
differing altogether. The first are the result of two progressing and opposed
undulations, the second of four: but the heaps of crispations are produced by
the power impressed on the fluid by the vibrating plate; are due to vibrations
of that fluid occurring in twice the time of the vibrations of. the plate ; and
have no dependence on progressive undulations, originating laterally, as many
of the phenomena described prove. Thus, when the edges were beyelled (72.
110), or covered with cloth, or wet saw-dust, s0 that waves reaching the side
should be destroyed, or when the limits of the water or plates were round (91)
or irregular, still the heaps were produced, and their arrangement square.
When the round plate (93) was used, regular crispations were still produced,
though, as the water extended over the nodal line, and was there perfectly
undisturbed, no progressing and opposed undulations could originate to pro-
