a result which would be achieved by treating the boom as a beam obeying the elementary

theory of bending and using the rigid-body conditions u = dv/dx = OF and Upoom = Yweb

at x = 0. In future we shall in fact treat the boom by this method, an approximation which
Acan be justified arithmetically at any time by investigating the magnitude of the shear
distortion terms as given by equation (3).
