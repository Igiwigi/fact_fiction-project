same for the Gottingen workers and the present author, except that the results were used
in Géttingen without the sedimentary corrections. As the stations were chosen to make these
corrections as uniform as possible this difference usually had little effect on the velocities,
and the main discrepancies arise from the fact that my values were based entirely on first
arrivals. The most significant difference is in the velocity along the Soltau west profile,


ON THE NORTH GERMAN EXPLOSIONS, 1946 TO 1947 149

where the Germans included two late arrivals at short distances and rejected a first arrival
at 25-6km. As the velocity was based on only five observations spread over a range of
10km., it was very sensitive to changes of this type.
