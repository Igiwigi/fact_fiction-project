There can be no doubt of their general applicability to the Vegetable
kingdom. 5. The influence of temperature upon the general vital activity of cold-blooded
animals is no less remarkable, The facts determined by the experiments of Dr. W. F.
Epwarps{ lead to this general conclusion ;â€”that the rate of life of Batrachia and
Fishes, of which the activity of their respiratory process is the exponent, varies
directly (within certain limits) as the temperature of the surrounding medium ; $0
that the duration of life, when these animals are deprived of air, either partially or
completely, or are placed in any other circumstances unfavourable to its sustenance,
varies inversely with the external temperature. Thus when frogs were confined in a
limited quantity of water, and were not allowed to come to the sarface to breathe, it
