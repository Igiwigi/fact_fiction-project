is a Markov Random Field, its probability function may be written as a Gibbs distribution, and
vice-versa.”

This led to the development of Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques for estimating posterior
probabilities, and the explosion of applied Bayesian methods (some of this story is told in
an unpublished MA thesis by Tiani Li [MAPSS, University of Chicago, 2022]); however, these
techniques were generally used in the social sciences to better estimate existing classes of models
whose theoretical bases were independent of the underlying physical model involved. The one
possible case in which there might be theoretical cross-fertilization would seem to be the field of
social network analysis. This is because the same mathematics that underlay the processes used
to fit the model also underlay the model itself.

7The Metropolis algorithm got its wonderful name by the fact that Nicholas Metropolis controlled the computer at Los
Alamos, but more central in the development of the method was the last author, Edward Teller, father of the H-bomb and
inspiration for the insane physicist in the movie Dr. Strangelove. The computer they worked on was named MANIAC. As Fred
Kwan said, ‘It’s the simple things in life you treasure.’


Frank & Strauss [43] realized that the Hammersley—Clifford theorem also had implications
for the attempt to construct probability distributions for social network data, a project that
had engaged many of the most creative minds in social statistics (here, see, e.g. [44]), but had
run into problems identical to those bedevilling Metropolis et al., namely the determination of
the Z constant allowing for the estimate of absolute probability. Making assumptions as to the
homogeneity of indistinguishable structural states led to what was first called the p* model, a
family of probability models for social networks marked by the Markov assumption (e.g. [45]).
