synthesis and production offer selective, safe and sustainable catalysis.

Protein engineering to create highly selective transaminases as biocatalysts in cascade reactions
was the topic that Professor Bornscheuer focused upon. This was a highly illuminating account
of progress that he and others have achieved in recent years. One of the remarkable facts that
he disclosed was that there are thousands of detailed structures in the Protein Data Base (held at
Rutgers University), the biochemical function of which are, as yet, unknown and unexplored. He
also reported that there are millions of gene sequences in databases ripe for future exploitation. :

Pursuing a theme that overlapped to some degree with the presentation of Professor Woodley, :=
Professor Regina Palkovits focused on efficient utilization of renewable feedstocks, and in is
particular the role of catalysts and of process design. She emphasized, with appropriate examples, :
the fact that renewable feedstocks exhibit a multitude of functional groups necessitating selective Da
de-functionalization strategies in low-temperature liquid-phase reactions in highly polar solvents. :

(d) Session 4 on catalysis and climate change 8

The first paper in this session, presented by de Leeuw, combined theoretical and experimental 1S
investigations of cubane-structured iron sulfide minerals as potential catalysts in the
transformation of carbon dioxide into organic molecules. It was interesting to note that, in her

work on the mineral greigite (Fe3S4), some pyruvic acid was produced; but it is not clear how

the Câ€”C bond present in this material is formed.
