At the time of migration the
larvae, known as the army worm (Heerwurm), form a procession said to be sometimes
forty to a hundred feet long, five to six inches wide and an inch in depth, and to
consist of millions of larvae sticking closely together and gliding along like a serpent. Such processions have been observed in the woods in Germany, Sweden, Russia,
and the United States. The object of these migrations is not known, for, as OsTEN-
SaAckEN pointed out, “ that the larvae do not migrate in search of food, can be inferred
from the fact that they appear to be full-grown when they form these processions ”’. WInneERTz believed he had found galls produced on the leaves of young lime-trees
by Sc. tilicola, but the correctness of this identification was doubted by Mrk and
OsTEN-SACKEN. Theinclusion of Sciaraamong the Mycetophilidae has been questioned by ENDERLEIN,
who, in 1911, pointed out the difference in the form of the adult eyes of the Sciarinae
from the Mycetophilinae and their close resemblance to the eyes of the Lestremiinae.
