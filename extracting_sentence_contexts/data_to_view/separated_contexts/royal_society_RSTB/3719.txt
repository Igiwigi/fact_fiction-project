THOMSON ON THE COMPARATIVE

has been taken out. This portion, as is shown by the colour reactions, probably
consists of a mixture of cellulose and pectose mucilage.” Though the plates are not
really resin, or even largely composed of resin, for convenience PENHALLOW’S
designation will be followed. From the standpoint, however, of the writer’s view
of the origin of resin tissue in the Conifers the fact that the plates are largely
composed of cellulose-pectose compounds is as important as the fact that they
contain resin. With regard to the development of the resin plates PanaaLtow (p. 56) states
that “the resin gathers locally upon the inner face of the tracheid wall, and as its
volume increases it projects from all sides towards the centre, where it coalesces to
form a continuous and imperforate septum.” The form of the resin deposit that
I have found is not such as can be accounted for as above. It does often appear in
radial and tangential sections (fig. 41, Plate 4, and figs. 44a and b, and 47, Plate 5)
like plates or spools, but with proper stain it may be seen to line the tracheids far
above and below the transverse part.
