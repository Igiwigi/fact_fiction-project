1 will show also that we have
(2x1, 1- /)=6, agreeing with (221, 1 - /)=2m+2n—6,
'The condition that the conic may touch an arbitrary line «7 +By +y2=0, is in fact
(0, —4i@, 2(464— 30), Zac, —$ab, 0Xs, Þ, y=0,

which, considering therein (@, 6, c, ) as coordinates, is the equation of a quadric surface
passing through the conic a=0, 46d —3c&=0; the quartic torse also passes through this
conic; hence the quadric surface and the torse intersect, in this conic, which is of
the order 2, and in a residual curve of the order 6; and the number of the conics
(2x1, 1 - /) is equal to the order of this residual curve, that is, it is =6. If the conic touch a second arbitrary line e/z+þB'y+yz2=0, then we have in like
manner the quadric surface

(0, —4@&, $(464—3e&), $ac, —Zab, O0Xe', B, y)*=0;

that is, we have the quartic torse and two quadric surfaces, each passing through the
conic a=0, 4b4—3&=0, and it is to be shown that the number of intersections not on
this conic is =5. The two quadric surfaces intersect in the conic and in a second
conic; this second conic meets the torse in $ points, but 2 of these coincide with the
point, a=0, 5=0, c=0, which is one of the intersections of the two conics (the point a=0,
þ=0, e=0 is in fact a point on the cuspidal edge of the torse, and, the conic passing
through it, reckons for 2 intersections), and 1 of the 8 points coincides with the other of
the intersections of the two conics ; there remain therefore 8—2—1, =5 intersections, or

we have (2z1, 1//)=5. Annex No. 5 (referred to, Nos. 22 and 71).—On the Conics which have contact of the third
order with a given cuspidal cubic, and two contacts (doudle contact) with a given conic.
