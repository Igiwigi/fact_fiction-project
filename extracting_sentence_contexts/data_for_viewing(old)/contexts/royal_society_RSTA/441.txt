8. Reviewers and comments

Let me firstly conclude with a scientist’s version of ‘lessons and carols’, namely ‘reviewers and
comments’. I believe that much is to be learned from the comments of the unusually thoughtful
reviewers of the big G determination of Harold and myself—an experiment which is described in
some detail in the proceedings of this meeting. So what can be learned?

Referee A wrote ‘Although the number of people who worry about the value of G is probably
pretty small, discrepancies of these magnitudes are serious business, and it is important to bring
this result to the notice of the standards community. The fact that the value reported here lies
within one sigma of the value reported by Luther ef al. is also interesting, although it might be a
coincidence’.

I have known Gabe Luther for many years and during my not infrequent trips to NBS/NIST
in Washington, DC, I always made a point of spending at least half a day in what always turned
out to be useful discussions with him. And given my high respect for Gabe, I would like to think
that the agreement between our two experiments is more than a ‘coincidence’.

Referee B thought the paper was well written and clear for the general reader but believed
‘that the reported discrepancy in the value of G is due to some unidentified systematic effect, and
the (PRL) letter did not contain enough detail to independently confirm that all sources of error
were identified. (Hopefully the Parks-Faller paper in the proceedings of this meeting will provide
