besides some of the relationships presented below. The first important result was
that it was rarely necessary to go beyond the e/m term—in fact, not at all for the
alkali metals—that if «, 8 were both included, and, of course, an additional line used
for calculation, 8 always came out a small fraction of «, and that with « alone the
agreement was much better than with 8 alone (Rrrz). Evidence of this is given
below.

As will be seen later, there are indications that a form D = m+p+e/(m+a) may
be the true form, at least for certain series. These indications will be mentioned in
due course, but as the metals of Group II. are not discussed in the present communi-
cation, the case may be further illustrated from a special series in Mg, which will at
the same time serve to show that too much stress must not be laid in favour of a
particular formula on the mere fact that it reproduces the observed lines, unless the
observations are very exact, or comprise the first members and a considerable number
of the others. The series in question was first discovered by Rypperc7 in K.R.’s
observations, and consists of six observed lines contained between 5528 and 3987,
which he called a+‘ new kind of series” of the Mg spectrum. Neither his own nor
K.R.’s formula reproduce the lines, and he suggested a combination of the two, viz.,

n = a—bf(m+p)—e]/(m+p)*.

As will be seen, this involves four constants and requires four lines to find the
constants. The formula reproduces the two last lines within error of observation.
