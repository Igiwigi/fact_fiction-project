Alternatively, the average
demand can be learned online based on the instantaneous demand on a base station, in which case
the caching problem can be modelled as a multi-armed bandit problem [55]. Clearly, additional
methods are needed to further reduce the computational time of demand forecasting.


(b) Communication overhead |

There is also an overhead of cooperation among SBSs and coordination between SBSs and macro-
cells that needs to be taken into account when implementing caching mechanisms. In fact, if 3
multiple base stations collaborate to cache some file segments, this requires extra metadata ae
management and may increase user experienced delay. This is more crucial in highly mobile
networks where users are rapidly handed off between the base stations. This issue is outside
the scope of our study, and we leave it as a future work.

(c) Conflicting objectives

Finally, we emphasize that operators and users have conflicting objectives; operators aim at
reducing their servicing costs, whereas user satisfaction degrades with increasing experienced : =
delay.
