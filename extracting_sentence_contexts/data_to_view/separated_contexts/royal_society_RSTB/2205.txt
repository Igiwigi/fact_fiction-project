The control experiment of estimating the field of the
3rd division, and then severing the nerve, I have carried out once. On severing the
3rd division, the anterior boundary of the field which had previously lain between
the angle of the mouth and the zygoma retreated to the pinna of the ear, ramus
of jaw, and thyroid cartilage (vide infra, p. 71, IIIrd cervical nerve). From these experiments it becomes obvious that if to the three divisions of the
Vth cranial we apply as a test for complete segmental character the fact found to
hold good for all complete spinal sensory-nerves, #.e., that the skin-field of a com-
plete segmental nerve extends continuously from the mid-dorsal line of the animal
to the mid-ventral line, the test gives, as regards the three divisions of the
Vth cranial, a distinct reply. It is impossible to mark exactly the anterior polar
point of the body, z.e., that point in the anterior end of the animal which occupies a
position there similar to that held by the tip of the tail in the posterior end of the
animal ; that being so, it is impossible to say whether the skin-field of the ramus
ophthalmicus does really reach the mid-ventral line of the body ; it certainly occupies
some of the mid-dorsal line, but the anterior pole of the body being the place of
junction of the mid-dorsal with the mid-ventral line of the body, to admit ignorance
of the position of the anterior polar point is tantamount to admitting that we do not
know where the mid-dorsal line ends and the mid-ventral line begins. Not being
able to say, therefore, whether the field of the ramus ophthalnucus does extend to the
mid-ventral line, we cannot apply the test confidently to it.
