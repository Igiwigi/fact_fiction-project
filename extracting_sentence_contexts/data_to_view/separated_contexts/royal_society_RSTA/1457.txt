The oft-
repeated mantra of the life sciences, as the pursuit of ‘hypothesis driven research’, has been cast
aside in favour of large data collection activities [7]. And, if the best minds are employed in large corporations to work out how to persuade people
to click on online advertisements instead of cracking hard-core science problems, not much can
be expected to change in the years to come. An even more delicate story goes for social sciences
and certainly for business, where the burgeoning growth of BD, more often than not fuelled
by bombastic claims, is a compelling fact, with job offers towering over the job market to an
astonishing extent. But, as we hope we have made clear in this essay, BD is by no means the
panacea its extreme aficionados want to portray to us and, most importantly, to funding agencies. It is neither Archimedes’ fulcrum, nor the end of insight.
