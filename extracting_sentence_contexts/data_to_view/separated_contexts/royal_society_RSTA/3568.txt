To sum up the change in the value of 5V,/8A produced by coring one or both of
the carbons, we find that while coring the positive carbon alone makes very little
difference in either the normal or non-normal change of cross-section that accom-
panies a given change of current, coring the negative carbon diminishes the change
of cross-section, both for normal and non-normal changes of current, but more for
the second than for the first, and more when both carbons are cored than when the
negative alone is cored. Thus, coring the negative carbon both diminishes and
retards the change in the cross-sections of the are that accompany a change of
current. This retardation of the change of cross-section is quite sufficient to account
for the fact already mentioned on p. 311, viz. that if I quickly altered the resistance
in the cireuit outside the arc, when both carbons were cored, I could sometimes see
