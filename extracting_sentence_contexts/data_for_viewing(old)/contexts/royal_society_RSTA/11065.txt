explanation receives unexpected confirmation in the appearance of the lop-sided
splashes of Series XX., in which we see, firstly, that the flutings are absent from that
part of the sheath which has left the sphere, and, secondly, we see how much higher
in every case the continuous film has risen in that part which has left the sphere than
in the part which has clung to it, and has been hindered by the viscous drag.
Especially is this the case in fig. 3, Series XXVI. (see p. 196),’where the liquid was
pure glycerine. The effect of the viscous drag is, in fact, most marked in the most

viscous liquid.

Influence of the Constants of the Liquid.

Finally, in confirmation of the general argument, we have the fact that with a
liquid of small density and surface tension, such as Alexandra oil, a much smaller
velocity of impact with a highly polished sphere is required to give “rough” splash
than with water, a liquid of greater density and surface tension, the reason being
without doubt that the tangential velocity due to the impact is greater with the less
dense liquid, as, indeed, is proved to be the case by the greater height to which the
surrounding sheath is thrown up, and the smaller the surface tension the less will he
the abatement of velocity on account of work done in extending the surface.

[Added January 11, 1900.—The constants of the Alexandra oil employed in the
experiments were as follows: Specific Gravity, 0°840; Surface Tension, 2°89 grams
per metre (= surface tension of water x 0°383) ; viscosity = viscosity of water at the
same temperature x 2°607. Experiments shortly to be described show that the
