work of extermination appears to have been accomplished ; and there is at present
not a single living example either in the Mauritius, in Rodriguez, or Reunion ;
a few isolated individuals are kept in a state of captivity in the Seychelles, imported
from the island of Aldabra, the only spot in the Indian Ocean where this Chelonian
type till lingers in a wild state in small and gradually diminishing 'numbersF. That
this Tortoise from Aldabra is specifically distinct from the extinct ones of the Mauritius
and Rodriguez, we shall see subsequently.

In the second place, I have to refer to the accounts given by the most trustworthy
visitors to the Galapagos Tslands. According to the unanimous testimony of geo-
graphers, the first discoyerers of this archipelago, the Spaniards, found the islands 80

® On this point the testimony is unanimons and not to be doubted: in fact all Tortoises are long-lived.
Mr. E. W, H. Hornsworrn, F.L.S., informs me of an individual carried to Ceylon (Colombo), and said to haye
lived in the island for 150 years. Another example, in Cerf Island, is known to haye been kept there for the

living example from Aldabra, 7 inches long, sent to me by Dr. W. M*Guecos, is now 3 years old.
+ I am indebted to His Excellency Sir Axrnvr Gonnox, Goyernor of the Mauritins, for this information,

I may add, from my own experience, that the Aldabra species is but rarely brought to) London now, In 1
the years 1857-59 I aw several large living examples brought into the London market, and one which T
