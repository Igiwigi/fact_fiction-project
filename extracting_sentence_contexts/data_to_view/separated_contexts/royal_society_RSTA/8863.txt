The others should be weak and in a region where
glass apparatus would only allow strong lines to be registered. F (5) should be at
35148°01+2¢ but is not seen. The line 35259'2 is about a v link ahead, in fact
».35259°2 = 35152°4. It may, however, be noticed that 36536 above is just 154
behind the expeeted F (4), so that it is the F line corresponding to the parallel F set
above with the separation 156 (say F’). In the same series is also found
F (6) = (2):34087'1 corresponding to the F’ (6) =29196.u.
