The solution that bends preferentially in the short direction of the plate (blue with a solid
boundary curve in the right inset) has highest energy; the solution that bends preferentially in the long direction of the plate
(light orange with a dashed boundary curve) has intermediate energy; and the solution with lowest energy bends approximately
equally in both directions (green with a dotted boundary curve). The two new solutions arise from a saddle-node bifurcation
that is part of the unfolding of a pitchfork bifurcation, where the imperfection parameter is related to deviations of the aspect
ratio of the plate from 1. (Online version in colour.)


this branch has indeed higher energy than the other two, quasi-cylindrical, branches for V > V*. Figure 5 shows the deformation energy as opposed to the total energy because the bifurcation
is difficult to visualize in the latter representation, due the fact that all of the solutions have
comparable total energy. To summarize, the three-dimensional model discussed here, although limited to small
deflections of the plate, is able to reproduce the initial configurations seen in capillary origami
experiments, as the plate begins to wrap around the drop. Although it cannot capture folding, it
nevertheless provides a physically valid reduction, which can be used to understand the three-
dimensional effects that are of paramount importance in the early stages of the encapsulation
process.
