branches of the curve has wholly disappeared, and the form of the other is modified by the
coincidence of the asymptotes with the axis of #; it has in fact acquired a cusp at infinity
on the axis of = (sce fig. 12). When @<4, the curve consists of a single finite branch, with
two cusps on the axis of &, and two cusps at the points of intersection with the circle
through the radiant point ; one of the last-mentioned cusps will be outside the reflecting
- circle as long as a>+4; fig. 13 represents the case a=4, for which this cusp is upon the
reflecting circle. For a<+4, the curve lies wholly within the reflecting circle, one of the
cusps upon the axis of & being always within, and the other always without the circle
through the radiant point, and as @ approaches O the curve becomes smaller and
smaller, and ultimately disappears in a point. The case @ negative is obviously included
in the preceding one.
Several of the preceding results relating to the caustic by reflexion of a circle were
obtained, and the curve is traced in a memoir by the Rey. Hauer HoLDITCH,
