assimilated spinal segments, employed above, is most useful in comparing related
genera, yet it is probably misleading when different phyla are compared. ‘Thus
somite W of Scyllium is probably homologous with V of Ceratodus and Acipenser,
and with X of Dipneumona and Necturus. All these somites lie under the IXth
nerve.)

It has been shown above that the primitive number of branchial segments in
gnathostome Vertebrates was probably five. ‘The number may, however, undergo
fluctuations, and one kind of fluctuation is by separation of the branchial region into a
greater or less number of segments than usual, without the intercalation or dropping out
of any one individual segment (vide supra).
