similar causes, and that the platyenemia, as ordinarily exhibited in man, is not a
. reversion to a simian character, for the pilastric femur is essentially human.

Here, then, we appear to have a character which is produced by the direct action
of use, and probably any hardy race of hunters would exhibit the flattening to a
greater or less degree, A tibia assumes its platyenemic form only after puberty,
and it would be exceedingly interesting to know whether this character, which seems
to be purely “acquired,” could be inherited.

Some years ago, Mr. ArtHuR THomson* drew attention to the fact that in many
savage races a facet could be found upon the anterior margin of the articular surface
of the tibia with the astragalus. He also noticed that, in the tibiee exhibiting these
facets, the external condyloid surface was frequently flattened, or even convex.
These characters he attributed to a frequently-assumed squatting posture. In the
majority of the tibiee of the New Race this facet could be detected, also, in the same
bones the outer condyloid surfaces were often convex, instead of being slightly
concave. We may hence conclude that “squatting” was the habitual custom of the
New Race. :

As it has been above remarked, many of the tibiee exhibited a strong backward
curvature of the upper extremity. Professor ManouvrierR has pointed out that
such a curvature would serve to increase the resistance to an anterior sliding of the
