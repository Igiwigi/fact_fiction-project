Troutbeck, which is similarly sitnated to Wastdale, has only received about 5 inches,
or one-sixteenth less than the average quantity. The wet days at Wastdale are generally about sixteen more than at Seathwaite,
the wettest of the stations ; but in 1849, they are forty-three in excess, and thirty-one
more than have been recorded in any other part of the Lake District. This may be accounted for from the fact, that the mountains surrounding the Head
of Wastdale are both the highest and the nearest to the sea ; their elevated peaks at-
tract the clouds, and occasionally deprive them of the whole of their water ; and such
appears to be more particularly the case in dry seasons and periods. Hence Wast-
dale is visited with many showers which never reach the more inland valleys. The
increase in the annual depth of rain from this cause is, however, very trifling.
