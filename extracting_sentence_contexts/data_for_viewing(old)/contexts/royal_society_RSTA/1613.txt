In this paper, we deal with the existence of particular types of non-oscillatory solutions, that is
solutions x of (P) such that xy > 0, Axy <0 for large n and

lim xy =0, lim x! = Ay, P(Axy) = —00, (1.2)
n in

where x!" is called the quasi-difference of x. Solutions satisfying (1.2) are called intermediate
solutions. This terminology originates from the corresponding continuous case and is due to the
fact that, when (1.1) is satisfied, any non-oscillatory solution x of (P) satisfies either limy xn = lx 4
0, or (1.2), or limy Xn = 0, lim, xl = —lx, 0 < ty < 00, see [3,4]. The investigation of intermediate
solutions is a hard problem, due to difficulties in finding suitable sharp upper and lower bounds
for these solutions, see e.g. [5, p. 241] and [6, p. 3], in which these facts are pointed out for the
continuous case.

In the half-linear case the problem of the existence of intermediate solutions has been
completely solved by the following.
