are responsible for the Stark anisotropy are determined by the atoms immediately
surrounding the Mn** ions, and since their distributions are presumably independent
of the concentration of Mn** in the mixed crystal, we should expect the Stark
anisotropy to be independent of the concentration of Mn. The interaction aniso-
tropy, on the other hand, should rapidly fall down as the concentration of Mn in the
crystal diminishes.

Let us, for brevity, denote by A the molecule of MnSO,. (NH,), SO,.6H,O
and by B that of MgSO, . (NH,), SO,.6H,O. Consider now a molecule A +- nB
of the mixed crystal. Its diamagnetic anisotropy may, to a first approximation, be
taken to be equal to (” + 1) times that of B, and may be corrected for, as in § IX.
The remaining part of the anisotrepy would then represent the sum of the Stark
and the interaction anisotropies (A(z), and (Ay); say. We can now use the fact
that (Az), should be independent of magnetic dilution of the kind considered, while
(Ay); should rapidly diminish with dilution, in order to separate the two.

Some preliminary measurements have been made by us on the magnetic aniso-
tropies of a number of such mixed crystals, and the results obtained are given in
Table V.
