J. Gaston. Darwin predicted that species with larger geographic range sizes would be more likely
to speciate, though recent work suggests that the probability of speciation is in fact greater for species with small to inter-
mediate range sizes. Developmental processes offer further insights into speciation and D. â€˜Tautz and K. Schmid consider
how the genes that regulate ontogenetic pathways may be involved in the generation of adaptive phenotypes.
