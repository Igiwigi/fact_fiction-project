In Malmgren’s model,
the volumetric effects of phase changes are entirely accommodated within the ice matrix, and
therefore saline ice shows the atypical thermal properties discussed in the previous paragraph. In situ observations [5] show that the average salinity of ice sheets remains virtually constant for
the period of observations despite the prevalence of brine drainage networks and brine corrosion
tubes that develop when the sheet warms. Cox [6] revisited Malmgren’s assumptions, and proposed that ice and brine are in fact free
to expand and contract independently (this is equivalent to assuming that the ice is infinitely
permeable). In Cox’s formulation, phase changes are accommodated by brine drainage (or by
brine being impelled into the ice) and so have no effect on the thermal expansion coefficient. He
therefore proposes that the volumetric thermal expansion of saline ice is the same as that of fresh
ice: around 1.5 x 10-4 K~!.
