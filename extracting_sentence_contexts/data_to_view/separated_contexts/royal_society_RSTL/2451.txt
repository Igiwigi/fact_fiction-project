under the external appearance
of the bivalve Monoculi (Astracoda), have a pair of pedunculated eyes, more numerous
and more completely developed members, approximating to those of Cyclops, and of
the perfect Triton ; while, in the present type, or Lepades, the larva resembles some-

or the resemblance is still more striking to that of the Argulus Armiger of LaTREILLE,
which, in fact, is but an Amymone furnished with a tricuspidate shield at the

be regarded as the perfect type to which all the others are to be referred (fig.
