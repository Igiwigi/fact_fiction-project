As the facts abundantly show, Palemon is, from a colour point of view, practically
identical with Hippolyte ; it contains pigments of similar colours; these pigments
react similarly to light. But, to return from the contrast, to the agreement, between these two forms: we
find, in the reactions of Palemon to white and monochromatic lights combined with
white or with black backgrounds, the same reaction to background which also
characterises both AZippolyte and Macromysis. The reaction appears to be general
among the littoral erustacea.
