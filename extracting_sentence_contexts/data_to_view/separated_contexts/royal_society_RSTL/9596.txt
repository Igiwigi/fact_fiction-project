The
second point of difference chiefly rests on the assumption that the protoplasm of the
fresh cell is finely granular, since in alcohol specimens an increase of protoplasm in the
cell is marked by an increased cloudiness. The differences which exist with regard to the formation of granules in those cells
which acquire an outer non-granular zone in activity and those which do not we shall
discuss later. We have first to consider what facts we have to support the view given
above as to the changes which take place in the pepsin-forming glands during
8ecretion. We have to show that (a) the using up of granules, (b) the formation of granules,
and (c) the growth of protoplasm all go on from the beginning to the end of secretion. (4.)
