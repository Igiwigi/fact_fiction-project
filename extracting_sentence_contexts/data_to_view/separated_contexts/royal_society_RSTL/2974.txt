There are many other analogous examples, which prove that no conclusion
can be drawn A priori, from the nature or chemical arrangements of minerals,
as to their relative electrical properties. Much time and attention have been bestowed by geologists on the conside-
ration of the origin and comparative ages of veins, and but little, I apprehend,
on the purposes for which they are designed. It appears to me that it will prove a vain attempt to reconcile a nultitude
of facts obseryable in our mines with any known natural causes. I may refer to a few of them :â€”

1st. The very oblique descent of a large proportion of the veins into the
earth, in some cases in very hard rock, and in others in ground 0 soft that
it would immediately fall in, however small the excavation, without being
completely supported by timber.
