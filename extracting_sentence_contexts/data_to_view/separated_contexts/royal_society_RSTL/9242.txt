This question of whether they he actually on, or only near, a definite curve 1s, if T mistake not, of very
great significance in the theory. If they lie on a curve obeying any exact mathematical law, their con-
nexion must, I think, be attributed to their corresponding to the consecutive partial tones of some vibrating
system (like those of an elastic rod or bell, for example). If, on the other hand, they lie near but not on
the eurye this cireumstance would snpport the hypothesis (which seems to accord with other facts) that
the visible lines are members of harmonic eries, most of the members of which are invisible, those only
being een whose positions chance nearly to fulfil a definite condition—a state of things which I have
Shown to exist in some aconstic arrangements, and which wherever it prevails exalts the intensity of the
harmonics whose positions nearly fulfil the requisite condition,

To ascertain which of the two foregoing alternatives is the true account of your typical lines, T con-
verted the wave lengths as you determined them into wave frequencies (the reciprocals of the wave
