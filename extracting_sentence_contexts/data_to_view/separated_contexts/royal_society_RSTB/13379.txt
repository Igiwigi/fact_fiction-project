Among diving reptiles, sea turtles perform deep and prolonged dives. Therefore, the diving of sea turtles can be a good comparison for the diving
of endotherms, marine mammals and seabirds. In fact, many studies have
been conducted on the diving behaviour of reptiles, including sea turtles [6]. On the other hand, very few studies have investigated the physiological aspects
of diving reptiles. For instance, the heart rates of free-ranging diving reptiles in
the field have only been reported in sea snakes [7], American alligators [8],
freshwater crocodiles [9] and leatherback sea turtles [10].
