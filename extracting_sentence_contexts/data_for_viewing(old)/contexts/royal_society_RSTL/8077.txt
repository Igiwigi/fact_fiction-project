samples of a large series. There is no necessity for the irregularity at the lower end
taking the form of an enlargement. For example, the formula might be applied to a
truly cylindrical pipe with a ball of solid material resting at the bottom.]

quite sufficient to establish a substantial agreement between theory and fact. It should
be understood that those here presented are not favourable specimens selected out of a
large number, but include, with one exception, all the measurements attempted. There
are many kinds of bottles and jars, and among them some of the best resonators, which
do not satisfy the fundamental condition on which our theory rests. The deductive
treatment of the problem in 8uch cases presents great difficulties of a different kind
from any encountered in this paper. Until they are surmounted the class of resonators
referred to are of no use for an exact comparison between theory and obseryation, though
they may be of great service as aids to investigation in other directions.
