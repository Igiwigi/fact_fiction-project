from subjects whose lungs were either much diseased, or in a
perfectly sound $tate, I found, that in the former, common in-
jection readily flowed, in the manner which I have described,
into all the cavities of the heart, but principally into the left
ventricle; whilst, in many of the latter, I could not impel the
least quantity of such coarse injection into that cavity.

This difference in the facility with which the cavities of the
heart can be injected from its nutrient vessels, was observed
by most anatomists, though they did not advert to the cir-
cumstances on which it depended. HALLER's recital of his
own observations, and of those of others on this subject, 80
well explain the facts which I have stated, that I shall take
the liberty of quoting the passage, in order further to illustrate
and authenticate them. He says, « Si per arterias liquorem in-
* jeceris, perinde in dextra auricula, sinuque et ventriculo dextro,
* et in sinu atque thalamo sinistro guttulz exstillabunt; szpe
« quidem absque mora, alias difficilius, et nonnunquam omnino,
« uti continuo dicemus, et mihi, et Szxaco, et clarissimo ZinNn1o,
* nihil exsudavit.” —Elem. Physiol. Tom. 1. page g82.
