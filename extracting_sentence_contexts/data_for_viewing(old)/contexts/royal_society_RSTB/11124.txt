4. Computational theories

Whereas there is broad consensus that animals from many
phyla perceive numerosity and reason about it arithmetically,
there is no consensus about what an appropriate computational
theory of this ability should look like. Three papers elaborate
three very different theories. Gallistel [26] suggests that the
symbols for number are realized at the molecular level and
form the basis for the brain’s ability to represent every kind of
quantity, not just numerosity. His theory attributes Weber's
Law to the limited number of bits used to represent magnitudes
across the many orders of magnitudes. He calls attention to the
fact that fixed-point schemes for representing number obey
Weber's Law. Hannagan et al. [27] suggest that numbers are
coded by vectors of activation across multiple cortical units.
Successive integers are obtained through multiplication by a
fixed but random matrix. Their scheme also generates
Weber's Law. Zorzi & Testolin [28] develop a scheme in
which the neural representation emerges from the interaction
between deep neural networks endowed with basic visual pro-
cessing when confronted with visually experienced sets. Their
scheme also exhibits Weber’s Law-like properties.
