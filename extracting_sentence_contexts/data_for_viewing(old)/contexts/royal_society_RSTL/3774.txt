doubtful still, obscurum per obscurius. But I rest my view of the function of the
Malpighian bodies principally on anatomical grounds, and the other considerations
have been introduced in connection with it, rather in consequence of the interest
they appear to me to add to it, than because I am fully satisfied of their validity.
Undoubtedly both questions are worthy of being separately handled, and require a
much wider and more elaborate investigation than seems yet to have been given
them. Meanwhile they may in turn receive some elucidation from the researches
detailed in this paper. Parallel lines of inquiry into the anatomical yarieties of the
Malpighian bodies and uriniferous tubes, and into the chemistry of their secretion, in
the different tribes of animals and in various stages of their development, could
scarcely fail either to confirm or to confute what has now been advanced.

I shall conclude with three remarks founded on the foregoing facts and speculations.

1. The bile and the urine have been ever classed together as the most, important
excretions. The former is secreted from venous þlood ; the latter it has been thought
ſrom arterial blood, except in some inferior animals, in which the blood from the
lower part of the body circulates through the kidneys. But it is a most striking fact,
that the proximate principles of the urine, like those of the bile, are secreted in all
animals from blood which has already passed through one system of capillaries,
in a word, from portal blood ; although it does not appear to what extent its qualities
are changed by trayersing the Malpighian system. The analogy is at least remark-
able, and may throw some light on the mysterious meaning of the portal circulation.

2. Diuretic medicines appear to act specially on the Malpighian bodies; and va-
