Phase slips have been historically predicted by Little [1] as thermally activated topological
defects, but it is now assessed that they may occur even at zero temperature, due to quantum
tunnelling events [2]. A phase slip event, in fact, is an elementary excitation of the order parameter due to
thermal or quantum fluctuations, corresponding to a local suppression of its amplitude and a
simultaneous jump of the phase by 27. As a consequence of the phase slip event, the superfluid
metastable state, ie. a local minimum of the Ginzburg-Landau free energy F [3] with velocity
vx VÂ¢(x), decays into a state with lower velocity, since the phase has locally unwound [1]. A phase slip can be thermally activated (TAPS) [4-6] when the temperature is higher than
the free energy barrier 5F between two neighbouring metastable states and the system may
overcome the barrier via thermal fluctuations.
