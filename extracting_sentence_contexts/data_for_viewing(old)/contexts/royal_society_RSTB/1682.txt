the injury. We have, however, collected from the literature of gun-shot injuries
such facts as receive general acceptation at the present day: and, further, have
arranged together the results of previous experiments by various investigators who
have thrown light on the causation and mode of production of the destructive effects
exerted by bullets on solid bodies and animal tissues.

Sryper (‘Lehrbuch der Kriegs-Chirurgie,’ Stuttgart, 1893) states, p. 20, that in
the general shock immediately following the infliction of any severe gun-shot wound
there are, so far as the pulse and respiration are concerned, the following changes:
“The pulse is small, often scarcely perceptible, very frequent, and easily compressible.
The respiration is accelerated and very superficial.”

In speaking of the symptoms due to local injury (p. 142), he re-states these
changes without alteration, except in cases where a general increase of intra-cranial
