MR, BRODIE ON CEROTIC ACID. 155

A question 8uggests itself, If it be true that this acid is volatile, and it be also true
that it exists in the wax in an uncombined state, how has it happened that it has
never been discovered among the products of the distillation of wax which have been
80 often examined ?

In truth, it is a remarkable fact, that while this acid, when heated in a nearly pure
state, as separated from the lead salt, distils over nearly unaltered, the same substance,
when distilled in an impure state, as separated, namely, by alcohol from the wax,
and mixed, as in this case, with other wax matter, which is decomposed by heat,
itself suffers decomposition. In the course of this investigation other examples have
occurred to me of similar facts.

About 3 0z. of the cerin, melting at 70* C., from which this acid can be precipitated
by acetate of lead, was distilled. The first portions of the distillate consisted entirely
of oil. Towards the end a small quantity of solid matter appeared. The oil, on stand-
ing, separated into two portions : the lower part was withdrawn by a pipette, being
but a small portion, say one-twentieth of the whole. The upper portion was boiled
with potash, only a very small portion of acid however was separated in this manner.
The soap was drawn off by a syphon, and the oil washed out with water. On being
washed with strong alcohol the oil dissolved, almost entirely, leaving only a small
portion of solid matter of the appearance of paraffin, This oil consists of a mixture
of oils of different boiling-points, which were separated as far as possible by rectifi-
cation, but during the distillation the boiling-point kept constantly rising, and I
