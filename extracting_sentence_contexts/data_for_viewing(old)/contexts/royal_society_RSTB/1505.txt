that this relation is not absolutely constant, but is affected by changes in the envi ra
mental conditions such as temperature, and hence it was thought useless to subje
any more of the measurements to this test of correlation. In five local races |
shrimps, Weipon* found the relation of the carapace length to post-spinous leng
to vary from °80 to ‘85. Garon had previously suggested that a relation such
this would probably be constant in all races of the same species, and WELDON seen
inclined to agree with this view, and to consider that these deviations may be due

incidental error, This conclusion seems to me to be scarcely justified by facts.

increase of 4*1 per cent. in the ratio of the arm lengths of plutei, the differences
of temperature, salinity of the sea-water, and other conditions, under which shrimps
btained from the various localities had developed, would be sufficient to account for
the differences found by WELDon in the values of 7, without looking elsewhere for
an explanation.
