These
authors asserted in addition, that Leguminous plants absorb nitrogen through their
leaves, without the aid of Bacteria. This opinion was refuted in 1892 by Kossowrrscu
(21), whose experiments led to the conclusion that the free nitrogen was absorbed
through the roots and not through the aérial organs. Since Franx’s work upon non-Leguminous plants was carried on in unsterilised
soils, his results cannot be considered trustworthy, and they were in fact, contradicted
later by Lorsy (39), ScHLnoEsmNG and Laurent (12) and others. Laurent in 1892
showed conclusively that Leguminous plants were able to make use of atmospheric
nitrogen, and moreover that this power was closely connected with the presence in
the soil of certain microbes, concerned in the formation of the tubercles on their
roots. In 1889 Vines (22) had shown that the formation of the tubercles was
favoured by a diminished supply of nitrates to the culture soils, and in 1893 Nospe
and HrtNer (23) came to the conclusion that those tubercles, in which the organism
does not reach the bacteroid stage, are injurious rather than useful to the plant, since
unchanged bacteria present in the tubercles seem to have no connection with the
nitrogen fixed by the plant.
