How well the probabilistic approach used in most studies actually describes future shaking
is unknown, primarily because such hazard maps have not been tested repeatedly with real
data. This situation differs from familiar applications, such as coin-tossing, which in contrast to : =

probabilistic maps, can be tested with human time scales [118]. Stein & Friedrich [116] conclude Sy
that while the uncertainty of events occurring on plate boundaries can be significantly reduced, 2
the timing of the earthquakes cannot, while uncertainties on the size can only reduce significantly aed
for the smaller events and not the very large ones. 22

Although maps may be improved by better estimating some parameters, the fact that others : Ss
cannot be much better estimated limits how good maps can possibly be. Hence, Stein et al. [119] DNS
assert that it is better to recognize and communicate the uncertainties involved. They thus propose : =
methods to assess how well a specific map performed and how to revise maps [120].
