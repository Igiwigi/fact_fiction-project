Fontrol experiment.—Ova impregnated and kept at the temperature of the room
58” F.), were 30” after, contracting and rotating slightly, 45" after, vigorously, 2» 30m
tr, were not cleft, but 6% 30” after, were cleft into eight masses.
Aixperiment d.—Ova ten minutes after impregnation, being warmed on the stage of the
nfxroscope to about 73? F., at first did not seem to be influenced ; but after ten minutes”
Satinuance of the warmth, they were seen to be moving more rapidly than those of the
trol experiment. The temperature was then raised to about 80* F., which, after
ome minutes, produced a state of almost complete rest, with the yelk-ball globular, the
lgcus germinativus nipple-shaded, and the oil-drops displaced. At the same time the
'Fitrol ova were vigorously contracting. Being then removed, and left at the tempera-
1Fe of the room, they completed the first cleft at 1" 50" after impregnation, and by
JE 30” after, were cleft into the coarse mulberry stage, and much in advance of the
trol ova; a fact, the more remarkable, because the contractions had been arrested
for a time by the highest temperature used. In this experiment the thermometer was
laid upon the cell, but probably indicated a temperature somewhat higher than that
reached by the eggs.

Experiment e.—Ova ten minutes after impregnation, put into a chamber, warmed to
83* F., and kept there for twenty minutes, were found actively contracting. In this case
I had reason to think that they did not reach the temperature of the chamber, which
was then heated to 102? F., and after some minutes, when the control ova were actively
contracting, these eggs became relaxed and still, 80 that their globular yelk-balls filled
the yelk-sac, and effaced the breathing-chamber, and the oil-drops were displaced and
scattered. On cooling the eggs again slowly to 58? F., the contractions reappeared in
