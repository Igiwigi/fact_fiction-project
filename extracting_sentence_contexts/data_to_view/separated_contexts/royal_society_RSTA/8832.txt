The value of F, (1) found is 3010°35 corresponding to a wave-length
in vacuo of 33218°7 A.U. The mantissa of 3010+dn with the limit 30725°26+¢ is
989285+35°9 (dn—€) = 90 {10998°8—"4¢+ "4dn}—611 = 90A,—8. The uncertainty
in A, as found from », is too large to settle the exact value of this with so large a
multiple as 90, but the fact as it stands that the mantissa differs from a multiple of
A, by only a few ouns is what is to be expected if the series belongs to the F type,
and so far certainly supports the more direct evidence given below for the existence of
the set depending on m = 1. With the value of A, found below da = —1’5. A glance at the list will show that the separations observed in the second and third
orders of F are less than the normal values.
