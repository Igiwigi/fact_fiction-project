by L,, and form a white image of the prism, also at F.

At M is a small electromotor carrying a disc with moveable sectors, so that any
amount of incident light may be cut off.

By this arrangement both the comparison-light and the spectrum itself are formed
by the light coming through the slits.

§ I. Graduation of the Sectors.

As the intensity of the comparison-light can only be altered by opening or closing
the sectors of the rotating discs, it is essential that their graduation shall be good. As
a matter of fact, the circles were carefully divided, but the graduation was only regarded
as sufficiently accurate when the aperture used was more than 5°, since for very small
angles the ratio of any small error in graduation to the aperture used might then
not be negligible, which it would be where the aperture was fairly large. As it almost
always happened that coloured light had to be measured, which was very much
dimmer than the comparison-light diminished by an aperture of 5° in the discs, it
became necessary to adopt some other means. To accomplish this, one of the two
following methods was employed: Ist, either the light was absorbed by means of
coloured glasses ; or 2nd, a mirror of unsilvered glass was used. Both of these plans
enabled readings of coloured light of feeble intensity to be measured with apertures of
the rotating dises, commencing at 90°. With such modified reflected light it was
rarely necessary to close the sectors to less than 5°. The glasses used were red, green,
blue, or violet, repeated experiment having shown to General Frstrne and myself
