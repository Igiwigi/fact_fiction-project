brana externa or chorion (b) that lines the interior of the shell. These membranes exist
in the egg at the period when the embryo is complete; the membrana externa, or
proper chorion, till lining the interior of the shell, and the membrana vitelli con-
stituting the amnion which incloses the young animal. We are thus able to iden-
tify in these low forms of Articulata the parts that are known to exist in the most
perfect animals, and in addition to them, the external envelope orshell. It is worthy
of remark, that the whole of these structures are formed in the ovisac, in which, as
before shown, only one egg is secreted at the same time, and is then passed, com-
plete in all its parts, into the oviduct, to be impregnated preparatory to the produc-
tion of the new being.

3. Deposition of the Ova, and Habits of the Species.
I have never yet seen the Iulidz in coitu, but from the fact that the oviduct in the
female, at the season of depositing her eggs, is always completely filled with them, all
equally developed, as well as from the entire absence of a spermatheca, we may rea-

sonably conclude that the act is of short duration, and that oviposition takes place
very s00n after impregnation. From the circumstance that many eggs are far ad-
vanced when the animals are collected in the autumn, I at first supposed that season
to be the proper period for depositing the eggs ; but the facts now about to be stated
induce me to believe that this process takes place very early in the spring.
