deprived of its epidermal layers, has been fully 24 inches in diameter, the woody zone
has a breadth of -37, and each linear row contains about $0 vessels. As usual the inner-
most of each series are the smallest, and they increase in 8ize as they proceed outwards.
The medullary rays are very abundant (Plate XXV. figs. 9 & 10, F). In the tangential
sections (fig. 10) they are easily recognized ; but, owing to the delicacy of their texture, a
superficial observation easily leads to their details being overlooked in the radial sections.
They are nevertheless most distinct, sweeping across the vessels in straight and parallel
lines from the medullary to the cortical surface of the ligneous zone; precisely as they
would be seen to do in a corresponding section of any exogenous wood. The exogenous
growth of this portion of the stem is sufficiently obvious. We have the radiating
arrangement, and the regular increase occurring in the number of vessels in each linear
row, as the stem enlarges its diameter. The new vessels have not been intercalated,
but added to the exterior of each series,â€”a fact often rendered evident by the circum-
stance that, from their walls being less strengthened by ligneous deposits than in the

case of the older vessels, they are much more liable to be disturbed and disarranged by
lateral pressure. 7

* Other specimens haye come under my notice, in which the medullary yessels encroached almost entirely
upon the inner parts of the pith ; nevertheless there remained the central spot, of which the transyerse line
dividing the medulla into two halves is the lateral extension.
