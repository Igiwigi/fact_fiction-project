The precise nature of these hormones is
not yet understood. Possibly they are breakdown products of protein formed in the dead
cells lining the wound, but there is evidence, for instance, from the study of the production
of growth-promoting substances in yeast injured by ultra-violet radiation (see review by
Needham 1942), that they may be produced as a physiological response to injury rather
than as cell disintegration products. The extremely local areas which these substances are
able to influence, and the fact that they are apparently not distributed to the body via the
blood stream, suggests either that they are unstable or that some mechanism exists for
their rapid destruction. Whatever their method of formation and destruction, and whatever
their chemical structure, the effect of these wound hormones appears definite. Diffusing
into the tissues immediately adjacent to the wound, they greatly increase the rate of mitosis
by the elimination of the two forces of cell inertia and mitosis depression.
