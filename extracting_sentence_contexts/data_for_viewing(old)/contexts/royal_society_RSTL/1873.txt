substitutions.

Converting the coefficients of the arguments of longitude into sexagesimal
seconds;

The numbers underneath are the yalues according to M. DamoisEavu.

The coefficient of the variation thus obtained (2113" or 35' 13") agrees
within three seconds with that found by Newrox, vol. iv. p. 19, which is 35' 10”.
The approximation is in fact of the same order as that of NEwron. NewroN
does not appear to have succeeded in determining the evection, the most con-
siderable of all the lunar inequalities after the equation of the centre. The
value assigned by him to the annual equation is 11' 51” or 711” (corresponding
to e, = 0169166); he has not however given the method by which it was
obtained.
