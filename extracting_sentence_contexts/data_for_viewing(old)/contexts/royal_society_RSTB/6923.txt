The colours of the varieties are not an adaptation to the external environment as in
warning coloration etc. nor is there evidence as yet that the colour as such is of direct physio-
logical importance to the animal. The varieties appear to illustrate Poulton’s category of
‘non-significant colours’, in which colour is a by-product of biochemical processes utilized for
other purposes.

The vivid colours of the sea anemones and their allies have always been placed
among the wonders of nature, but the question why it is these animals possess them
remains unanswered. From time to time during the last 60 years various pigments
have been isolated from anemones, but the metabolic origin and function of the
pigments remain obscure. Not only are the colours often intense, but they vary so
greatly within the same species that even anemones living side by side may show a
complete contrast of pigmentation. This variation is as important as the fact of pig-
mentation itself if we are to consider the function of the pigments. In order, therefore,
to attack this problem we chose a species Metridium senile (L.) in which colour varia-
tions are striking and of many kinds. Its varieties depend not so much on complex
patterns as upon large washes of a few pigments over well-defined regions of the body.
This simplifies both description and biochemical analysis.

THE COLOUR VARIETIES OF METRIDIUM SENILE

The animals were collected from Hunstanton, Lowestoft, Southwold and Tollesbury
in East Anglia, and from Plymouth and Millport on Clyde. There was no essential
difference in the colour varieties obtained from these places. Apart from its colour
variation, M. senile shows some indications of varieties which differ slightly in size
