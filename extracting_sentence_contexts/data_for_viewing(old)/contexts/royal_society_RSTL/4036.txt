when the ray was ent vertically through it, and the eye-piece moved to correspond
to the rotation impressed upon the ray in this position by the magnetic curves alone,
the superinduction of the passage of the electric current made not the least differ-
ence in the effect upon the ray. :


RELATION OF LIGHT TO THE MAGNETIC FORCE. 15

q iii. General considerations.

2221. Thus is established, I think for the first titne*, a true, direct relation and
dependence between light and the magnetic and electric forces; and thus a great,
addition made to the facts and considerations which tend to prove that all natural
forces are tied together, and have one common origin (2146.). It is, no doubt, dit-
ficult in the present state of our knowledge to express our expectation in exact terms ;
and, though I have said that another of the powers of nature is, in these experiments,
directly related to the rest, I ought, perhaps, rather to say that another form of the
great power is distinctly and directly related to the other forms ; or, that the great
power manifested by particular phenomena in particular forms, is here further iden-
tified and recognised, by the direct relation of its form of light to its forms of electri-
city and magnetism.

2222. The relation existing between polarized light and magnetism and electricity,
is even more interesting than if it had been shown to exist with common light only.
It cannot but extend to common light; and, as it belongs to light made, in a certain
