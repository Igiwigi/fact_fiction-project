The related two-dimensional problem involving an infinite uniform slit in a perfectly
reflecting screen will be considered in the present paper with particular reference to the
case of a plane pulse of H(t) shape arriving at normal incidence. Both the slit and the strip are special cases of a plane screen with apertures for which it
was shown in paper I that the complete pressure field can be explicitly obtained if either
(a) the pressure gradient through the apertures or (b) the pressure on the back of the screen
can be obtained. These latter can in fact be derived for the slit by following the same method
as in paper I, namely, the derivation of an integral equation which, when transformed by
the Laplace transformation, can be solved by using the basic relation I (52) to give a final
series solution corresponding to successive diffraction waves. Nothing essentially new in the
mathematics arises, however, in such further application of the integral equation method,
and it has been thought more instructive to use an alternative approach of a more physical
character in the present paper. This physical approach uses the final results of paper I and
serves in particular to illustrate how more complicated problems involving strips as obstacles
could theoretically be tackled.
