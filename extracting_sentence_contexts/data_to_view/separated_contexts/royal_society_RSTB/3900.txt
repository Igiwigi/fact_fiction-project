It will be seen that
E. esculentus and E. acutus both vary towards one another, but that some individuals
are so exactly intermediate that they cannot fairly be said to belong to one species
or the other. It seems quite probable that these examples are natural hybrids. This
is supported by the fact that hybrids between these two species raised in the
laboratory are more or less intermediate in character between both parent species. As mentioned above, /. miliaris is typically a shore species. The material used
in these experiments was mostly obtained at low spring tides from Wembury Bay
and from Cawsand Bay. â€˜The urchins are usually found under large boulders and in
crevices of the rocks,
