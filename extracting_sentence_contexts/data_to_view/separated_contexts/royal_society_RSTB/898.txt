But. this is probably only a small part, and
not the most primitive of their functions. They are also related to the general
processes of the body, notably to the bodily nutrition. In Daphnia they may be
readily watched engaged in the transportation of fatty particles from the alimentary
canal to its place of storage.t Also any abnormal condition of the perivisceral fluid, 4
blood, leads to the massing of these cells around the special excretory organs of thi

animal, and this fact suggests that their activities are partly directed to maintaining
the normal constitution of the body fluids so far as the dissolved matters are

concerned. 7

us, though exact knowledge. is wanting, yet it is abundantly clear that the
eous sporadic mesoblast of Daphnia is intimately related to the processes of
physiological importance taking place in the alimentary canal and the
tory organs ; and there is no sufficient reason to lead us to believe that this
onnection has been entirely, or to any great extent, lost in the course of the
nce and specialization of these cells, which has produced the different wandering
ell-types of the higher animals. On the contrary, it is a matter of common
iological knowledge that the wandering cells are profoundly affected by events
ing in the alimentary canal.
