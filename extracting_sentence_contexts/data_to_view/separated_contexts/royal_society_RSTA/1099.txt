A comparative study of (a), (b) and (c) of fig. 10 suggests that the most active region
of the thundercloud came nearer the station on October 6 than on September 6 or 7. This is supported by the fact that the lightning discharges produced more violent
changes in the electrogram of October 6, during the passage overhead of the most
active region of the cloud, than on the other two occasions. * Recent observations of the sounds produced by explosion suggest a velocity of about 340 metres per
second, vide F. J. W. Wurepte, ‘ Solar and Terrestrial Relationships,’ International Research Council,
