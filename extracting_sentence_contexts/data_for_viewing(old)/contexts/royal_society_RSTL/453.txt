the Corundum Stone, and its Varieties, &c. 249

heated to the: degree known by the term cherry red. The sparks
which are obtained from this 'stone by means of a piece of steel,
have also some appearance of the above colour. These phe-
nomena- may perhaps serve to assist us in acquiring further
knowledge respecting the cause of the phosphorescence of stones,
of which we have hitherto had no very satisfactory explanation.

GRAVITY,

The specific gravity of corundum, in its different varieties,
presents a series of interesting facts, particularly when they are
compared with what has been already observed with respect to
its different degrees of hardness. The great interest I have felt
in the study of this substance, has caused me to take particular
care in the examination of such of its properties as might lead
to a perfect: knowledge of it. I will now state the results of
the observations with which the character now treated of has
furnished me.

Of 2g specimens of the different varieties of imperfect corun-
dum, the mean specific gravity was g9g1. The lightest was
3875; and the heaviest 3981. Six of the gg were above ggoo.
Eleven were between 4900 and g931 ; andthe remaining sixteen
