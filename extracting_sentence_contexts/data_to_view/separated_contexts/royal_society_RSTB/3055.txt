But as siphonogamy has become universal in the higher
plants, it is perhaps remarkable that a similar method of carrying the female nuclei
to meet the pollen-tube through the lower part of a thick nucellar cap has not been
developed in other cases besides that of Welwitschia. The fact that the nuclei
are advanced some distance up the nucellus before pollination occurs, implies that,
ceteris paribus, the time which elapses between the germination of the pollen-grain
and the fusion of the sexual nuclei is much shorter than would be the case had the
pollen-tube to traverse the whole distance from the top of the nucellus to the
prothallus. In view of the conditions under which the plant lives this fact cannot
be without significance. LIST OF WORKS REFERRED TO.
