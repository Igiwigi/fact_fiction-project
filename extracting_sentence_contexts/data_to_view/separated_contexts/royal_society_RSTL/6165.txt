The

local gravel of an oolitic district is usually composed of 8mooth flat pebbles, whilst if flint-fragments are
present, as is common, they are angular or subangular. Extraneous fossils, as in the Crag, necessarily
present, in general, the maximum of wear, besides showing more or less lithological dissimilarity.

+ It is quite possible, at the same time, that here, as elsewhere, older gravel beds may have furnished
8ome of the materials of this grayel. Tn fact I should judge such to be the case, from the cireumstance of
many of the flints found in the white chalky beds being of a brown colour and all the edges rounded, show-
ing therefore a mineral condition incompatible with their present position, and a large amount of wear,

t On this essential point I give the evidence of a late distinguished naturalist of Abbeville. Appendix (O).

$ To show, however, how abundant flint-instruments must have been at periods when the use of metals
was in its infancy or unknownâ€”at Cantin, near Douay, there were found, in 1824, 600 ancient flint flakes
or kniyes amagged together in one heap (Mem. Soe. d'Emul. 4'Abbeville for 1836-37, p. 257); and the
eminent antiquary, M.
