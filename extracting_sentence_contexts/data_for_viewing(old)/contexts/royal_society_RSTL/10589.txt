cases of increase of Leguminos# under the influence of a potass manure, Lathyrus
pratensts is by far the most prominent constituent. As already intimated, however,
the later partial separations further show that the Leguminosze have considerably
declined on plot 16, and are now more prominent on both 19 and 20, and more 80
again on 19 with the nitrate of soda, than on 20 with the nitrate of potass. According
to the complete separations, Lathyrus pratensis is seen to be the mos prominent
leguminous species on all three plots, s0 far as final weight is concerned ; but according
to the notes taken on the ground during growth, Trifolium pratense or T. repens
showed considerable prominence on the two newer plots ; 7. pratense being the more
prominent with the more rapidly distributing nitrate of soda ; and T. repens the more
8 with the probably more superficially retained, and less deeply distributing, nitrate
of potass. The greater prominence of the Lathyrus in the samples is no doubt partly
accounted for by the fact that a larger proportion of its produce would be included in
the crop as mown, whereas a considerable proportion of the Trifoliums would be left
uncut. At any rate, it is clear that Leguminosw are fayoured on all three plots ; and
it would geem more 80 with the nitrate of soda and sulphate of potass than with the
nitrate of potass. Whether the decline on all three in the later years (subsequent to
the last complete 8eparation), but the more on the plot which has been the longer
under treatment, be due to an exhaustion of the plants, and to the increased com-
petition with the grasses, under the influence of the manure, and especially of the
