Since the directional effects for the colours are different, the conclusion is that the
receptors for these colours point at somewhat different parts of the pupil. But this attractive
idea meets with difficulties, for if the receptors for these different colours all lie intermingled
and closely paired side by side, all interstices being filled up, how does it come about that
the red cones all seem to be pointing in one direction, the green cones in another direction,

the blue cones in a third direction, and lastly, the yellow cones, if such there be, in a fourth
direction? Alternatively, if in fact, by some curious arrangement, the cones of different
response do point in different directions, why is evidence of this entirely lacking when
sections of the mammalian retina are examined microscopically? To neither of these
questions was there a suitable answer, nor was a satisfactory explanation of the retinal
direction effect forthcoming. But the cluster hypothesis offers such an explanation. Stiles
& Crawford found their effect by comparing the visual luminosities of two narrow beams
of light, one of which had passed through the centre of the pupil, while the other passed
through some other part which could be chosen at will. Now Dâ€™Silva & Turton (1947)
have shown that when colorimetric comparisons of brightness or colour are being made,
a small, and possibly a very small, part of the retina is actually being used for the purpose.
Thus it is quite likely that the clusters of red-sensitive cones near the fixation point, which
are used when high pattern acuity is required, are also used for purposes of colorimetric
comparisons when red light is in use. Support for this view is obtained from the recollection
