K, Rb, and Cs.

Density and Molecular Volume.
in every group. The molecular volume of the ammonium salt, however, is nearly
identical with that of the rubidium salt of the same group; on the average it is just
slightly higher, the differences varying from 1°6 above to 0°16 below the value for the
rubidium salt. The average difference of molecular volume, for the whole of the
double sulphate series, between a K and a Rb salt is 9°55 units, between a K and a
NH, salt 10°41 units, and between a K and a Cs salt 22°23 units. The change of
molecular volume with change of the alkali metal thus follows the order of the atomic
weights of the alkali metals, and the absolute amounts are a higher function of the
atomic weight than direct proportionality. The two following tables will render
these facts clear.

The density of the ammonium salt is the lowest
