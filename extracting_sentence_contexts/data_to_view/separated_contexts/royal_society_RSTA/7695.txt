in which J and J’ are the principal second moments of the cross-section about the
principal axes parallel to y and x respectively at 0; ¢, 4’, ¢, are real plane harmonic
functions satisfying the boundary conditions

in which n denotes the outward drawn normal to the boundary of direction cosines
(1, m, 0). In the case of ¢, its conjugate function 7, satisfies the boundary condition

V5 = $(x?+y?) +const., (2-12)

and we find it convenient usually to find y, and deduce ¢, if needed. The constants
7 and 7’ in (2-4), (2°5), (2°7), (28) are determined from the fact that, since the stresses
across a section z =c, (0<e</), acting upon the material for which z<c, must be
equivalent to the load (W, W’) localized at (/’, g’), in particular their moments about
the z-axis must be the same, whence

the integrals being taken over the cross-section . The flexure functions ¢, 6’ are not quite of the classical form of Saint-Venant’s
flexure functions x, x’, as given in Love (1927, pp. 332, 343), but are closely related,
since

b+ip’ =—(x+Iy') + (1+ 4) (x+y) 9/3, (2-15)

The solution we are using is the form to which one is led naturally by the semi-inverse
method, assuming (2-2), (2-3) and (2-6), and solving for the remaining stresses from
