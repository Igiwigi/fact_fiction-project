But the quantic
(a,'b..Þ, a Nev)
considered as decomposable into linear factors, 7. e. as expressible in the form

a(x—ey)(2—PYy)..,


MR. A. CAYLEY'S INTRODUCTORY MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS. 255

gives rise to a fresh series of results. We have in this case

{yd.} =0,+d;..

{xd,} =—(«+Þ..)ad,+4,+8Dg+..;
in fact, with these meanings of the symbols the quantic is reduced to zero by each
of the operations {xd,}—a®,, {y/,}—y®,, and we have consequently the definition of
the covariant of a quantic considered as expressed in the form a(z—cy)(zx—By).. And it will be remembered that these and the former values of the symbols {x9,} and
{y9,} are, when the same quantic is considered as represented under the two forms
(a, b, .b, a'Yz, y)" and a(x—ey)(x—PBy).., identical. 19.
