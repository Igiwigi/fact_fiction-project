ES Urea is a measure of exertion only s0 far as it measures food, if the nitrogen of the food
z be sufficient to maintain the vital actions; but if the tissues lose weight, the excess of
g nitrogen thus evolved will be added to the urea. If during muscular action there be

represent the nitrogen taken into the blood with the food. On the other hand, if the
bulk of the muscles increase with sufficient food, there will be a loss in the excretion of
nitrogen, because there has been an appropriation of it. Hence the evident relation of urea must be with food, although it m : ;
