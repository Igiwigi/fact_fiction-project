This is most remarkable at Singapore, where, though the successive low waters often
diter by six feet, the mean level only oscillates through a few inches. At Plymouth
the mean level is not quite 80 steady. The fact is, that at that port the low water
varies more by the difference of springs and neaps than the high water does; and
hence the mean level slightly follows the low water, and is lowest at spring tides, and
highest at neap tides, or perhaps more exactly a day or two later.

< The level of the sea at low water,” a phrase sometimes used by surveyors, is al-
together erroneous, and may lead to material error. From the instances just quoted
(and indeed from the nature of the case) it is certain that the mean height of the sea
is far more nearly constant than low or high water, under whateyer as8umed condi-
tions. A level surface drawn from any point (that is a surface of sfagnant water)
would probably be nearly parallel to the points of mean water at different places.
'This becomes more manifest when we consider that at places near each other the tide
often differs greatly in amount.
