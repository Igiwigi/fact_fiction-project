developing intermediate cells up to the mouth of the follicle.

The pulp has been considered (Litt and Jun, 1932) to be constantly growing
at its base, and constantly dying off and being resorbed at its apex. From the fact
that both in longitudinal and transverse sections the pulp may be seen to be actually
torn away, first from the barbs as they move upwards, and secondly from the feather
caps in process of formation, fig. 37, Plate 22, it would seem more probable that
the pulp actually withdraws and is resorbed at the base, as earlier authors (Davies,


THE EPIDERMAL STRUCTURES OF BIRDS 165

1889 and Srrone, 1902a) have observed. This is confirmed by the fact that growth
of the pulp is no longer necessary at this time, as when pulp withdrawal takes place,
the whole of the feather (except the calamus) has been formed, and only cornification
is to be completed.

(ii) Ducks

The development of definitive feathers in the Khaki Campbell duckling was
studied for the first eight weeks after hatching. In general, this process is similar
to that of the fowl, the chief differences being in the relative times of appearance of
the second generation of feathers. In the duckling, the wing feathers are retarded
in development and do not appear externally until the 5th week. The tail teleoptiles
however develop during the second week at the base of the greatly elongated calamus
