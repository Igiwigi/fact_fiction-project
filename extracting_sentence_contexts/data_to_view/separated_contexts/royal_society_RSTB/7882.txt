The follicle of E146, and the two
similar follicles in one of the ovaries of E116, were the largest encountered in the present
material. If such a follicle were to rupture without much further increase in size, the
former antrum being filled by luteal tissue, one might expect the formation of a corpus
luteum a great part of the bulk of which would be contained in a relatively large protu-
berance, such as is seen in the older corpora lutea of E130, one of which is seen in figure 17a. In fact, the appearance of the ovaries suggests that these corpora lutea were formed in just
such a manner from follicles very like those of E116 and E146. Further growth of such
corpora lutea would lead to an appearance very like that of the newest one of E130 (C),
seen in figure 175. Still further growth would produce the condition in the large corpora
lutea of the pregnant animals, such as are shown, for instance, in figures 16 and 18, plate 6.
