The talonid index, however, does not deviate significantly from the
orang-outang at a level of P<0-02. The tooth is, on the other hand, significantly longer
and broader than the corresponding tooth of the chimpanzee, with which, however, its
shape as described by the two indices which have been computed corresponds. This latter
fact may be noted in relation to Dartâ€™s (1934) claim that in its cusp morphology, and broad
squarish shape, this tooth is human rather than ape-like. Permanent dentition (Table 2)

The only teeth of the permanent dentition of the type specimen of Australopithecus which
had erupted are the upper and lower first molars. Upper first molar.
