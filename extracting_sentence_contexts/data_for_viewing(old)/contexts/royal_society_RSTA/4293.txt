structure. These can either cross the a-c interfaces (see [32] for this terminology and an analysis)
or end there. In both cases, these are low-energy interfaces. Evidently, the field is strong enough to
bias every other variant completely, while the alternate triangles retain some of these modulation
twins. Nevertheless, there is good quantitative agreement between the measured angles of the

triangles and the theoretical calculation summarized by figure 1. Evidently, this is due to the fact
that the monoclinicity is small.

The bent configuration is quite stable when the field is removed. This can be understood from
the fact that, due to the + invariance, fine arrays of 180° magnetic domains can be introduced into
each triangle, with 1/2 volume fraction + and 1/2 — so as to reduce the magnetostatic energy to
a low level when no applied field is present.

As we now explain, the elementary construction given above is a special case of a much more
general method of constructing curved zero-energy microstructures. From formula (2.12), one
can realize that it is produced by a particular action of two discrete groups of isometries, the
