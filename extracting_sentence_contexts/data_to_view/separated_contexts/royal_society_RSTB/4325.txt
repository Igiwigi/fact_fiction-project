Nor is it easy to place a hypothetical
acme at a certain point in skeletal elaboration, and say, ‘“ After this, further elaboration
was detrimental to the organism.” The process was one continuous piling up of skeletal
matter, and all the lineages, since they could not circumvent this, were doomed. SPENcER’s second proposition is ‘‘ that the early stages of a lineage may be
recognised by the fact that the forms are small, comparatively rare and unspecialised. The more mature stages are characterised by large, more specialised forms, which
occur in comparative abundance. In the old age of the lineage there are marked loss
5 of ornament and other specialised characters, and the forms are obviously tending to
disappear.”.
