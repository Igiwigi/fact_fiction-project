room with green windows; he could form of himself no idea that the light outside his

 prison Was of a different hue from that within ; he would call it white if he heard others

of nature, no doubt we should be quite as much astonished as he could be, at what had
remained 80 long unseen.

that blue and yellow combined properly make white, and that green is an independent
