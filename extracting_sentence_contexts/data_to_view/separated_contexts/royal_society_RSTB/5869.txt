The last twelve limbs, or thereabouts (there are twenty-seven trunk limbs in all),
show a gradual but marked change in structure from the more anterior limbs. The filter
sete on the second to sixth endites lose their filtratory armature of setules and become
brush sete, that is, the setules project all round the sete. They are naturally shorter
as the limbs themselves are shorter and also more crowded and this makes them more
robust, ‘The comb setze similarly are much shorter and are, in fact, powerful claws. The gnathobase shows the most marked change in structure. It becomes relatively

much larger and actually larger than the second endite. ‘The conspicuous triangular
claw process diminishes so that its base, from which the filtratory sete arise, becomes
more and more terminal until at about the twentieth or twenty-first limb the claw process,
as such, does not exist, while the blunt claws which terminate the claw process become
actually larger and point medially rather than anteriorly.
