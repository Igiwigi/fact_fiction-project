Carbon Dioxide—Carbon dioxide proved to be the most troublesome of any of the
gases to work with at low pressures. It appeared to be adsorbed both by the
balance and the walls of the balance case to a great extent, and the balance had to
be cleaned out and baked frequently to obtain concordant readings. Indeed, it
was found to be more difficult to work with carbon dioxide than sulphur dioxide,
although the latter gas was considerably more adsorbed by the balance case and
the tap grease, as was shown by observing the movements of the balance pointer
when the two gases were allowed to stand in the case for some time. The difficulty
appeared to be due to the fact that whilst the adsorbed sulphur dioxide could be readily
pumped off, the carbon dioxide was difficult to remove. In consequence of these
difficulties a very large number of low pressure ratios was taken, and as the balancing
pressure altered slightly each time the balance was cleaned, three sets of ratios were
obtained at oxygen pressures of about 229 mm., 237 mm., and 245 mm. The
three sets, however, have been averaged to give one mean ratio and one mean oxygen
