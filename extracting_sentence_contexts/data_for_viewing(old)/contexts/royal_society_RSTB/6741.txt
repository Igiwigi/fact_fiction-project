Ombo and Songhor. All these deposits should, I think, be considered to be contem-
poraneous with the upper part of the Turkana Grits and the earliest Miocene volcanics
in the Lake Rudolf region.

Returning to the question of the prominence of the Uganda escarpment west of
Rudolf, it might be suggested that the escarpment was rejuvenated by successive
movements, but if this had been the case a series of sediments corresponding to each
rejuvenation would be expected. As it is the Turkana Grits appear to be the only

* Dr H. Bancroft, of the Imperial Forestry Institute, Oxford, has kindly identified these trees as
belonging to the genus Dryoxylon. She believes on palaeobotanical grounds that their age cannot be
earlier than Cretaceous and is in fact more probably Oligo-Miocene.

sedimentary series, and they seem to be entirely conformable throughout. That the
Turkana Grits are not found in the immediate vicinity of the escarpment may be
accounted for by the fact that either the Miocene lavas or Quaternary deposits extend
almost to its foot and may therefore hide the local development that would be expected
there.

Dixey (1929) has suggested that those barren sandstones, the Adigrat Grits and the
Lugh Sandstones of eastern Abyssinia, may perhaps be regarded as of Karroo age. The
