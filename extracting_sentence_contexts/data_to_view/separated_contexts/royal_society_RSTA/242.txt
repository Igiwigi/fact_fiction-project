The superb performance of the panels
convinced many that the device had a promising future, but the manufacturing
problems were not common knowledge. In fact, it was a difficult device to make
in large quantity, and the cost of production was high. The emergence of rival
display effects persuaded Pioneer and Fujitsu to abandon plasma panels early in
2009, and the fact that the total market is reducing may well mean that plasma
panels will become a niche commodity.

iv) Flat cathode ray tubes

The engineering world had been very conscious in the mid-1900s of the
disadvantages of the CRT display, and it was not sitting idly by waiting for
an alternative to appear. The main problem was the cumbersome shape, which
was a great hindrance in moving to a larger screen size. The designers of a flat
replacement had to face at least two severe problems.
