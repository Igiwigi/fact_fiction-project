been shown by K6LLKER and WALDEYER in the case of mammals, and by Sax SIRENA
and myself in the case of Batrachia and Sauria (the present paper extending these
observations to the Ophidia) that the enamel-organ is absolutely the first structure
which can be recognized in the vicinity of a future tooth, and that the dentine-organ or
* papilla” can only be recognized at a later stage.

This very early appearance of an enamel-organ would seem to point towards the
enamel being both more important and more widely distributed than would be indicated
by the statement that * the enamel is the least constant of the dental tissues ”F. I was |
not therefore much surprised to find that the teeth of all the Ophidia which I have
examined, amounting to some ten genera, are coated with a thin layer of enamel.

In point of fact the thin layer of transparent tissue upon the outside of the teeth of
Ophidia described by Professor Owex and others as cementum, is not cementum, but is
enamel ; and this conclusion I can support by evidence which appears to me indisputable.
And not only must the generalization that © dentine and cement are present in the
teeth of all reptiles ” be abandoned, but, so far as my own observations go, the occur-
rence of cementum in the class of reptiles is comparatively rare, and it is in association
with exceptional conditions of attachment when it occurs at all.

I believe that it would bea correct statement, as regards recent reptiles at all events,
to say that the teeth of reptiles consist of dentine, to which is yery generally superadded

* Prof. Owzx (Odontography, p. 22) says, © The enamel is the least constant of the dental tissues ; it is
more frequently absent than present in the teeth of fishes ; it is wanting in the entire order of Ophidia among
