The separation of the earlier part of the discharge into striated

columns divided by intervening rifts does not, excepting in the

case of the first, extend far towards the poxitive terminal. Nevertheless, even as far as the positive
terminal itself, there seems at times to be a fuller development of discharge than is snbsequently
maintained. The first rift in the discharge, following the first onthurst, is zometimes distinguishable even as far as
the positive terminal ; and perhaps in those cases indicates a real cessation of the discharge. 'This is
corroborated by the fact that a similar interruption is then perceptible in the glow surrounding the
negative terminal ; but after this the negative glow retains its unbroken character throughout the entire

discharge. ON ELECTRICAL DISCHARGES THROUGH RAREFIED GASES. 175

usually followed by an apparently complete cessation of discharge ; ib then recom-
menced, and continued to exhibit during its entire period of existence variations of a
very irregular kind. It is, in fact, probable that during the period subsequent to the
first outburst and the momentary cessation of discharge that often follows it, the state
of the tube is much the same as it would be during a continuous discharge, in
consequence of the absence of any regularity of pulsation.
