Ambitious efforts are underway to restore forests across the globe [1], yet
restoration experiments at the temporal and spatial scale needed to guide these
efforts are largely lacking [2]. Most tropical forest restoration studies and on-
the-ground projects monitor only the first few years of recovery [3], despite the
fact that achieving desired biodiversity and carbon sequestration benefits
will take decades if not centuries [4]. Moreover, most past studies focus on
measuring survival and growth of planted trees, whereas long-term success of
forest restoration, particularly in highly diverse tropical forest, depends on the
establishment, survival and growth of naturally recruiting trees. An extensive
body of literature demonstrates the importance of quantifying demographic
processes to understand community dynamics and successional trajectories in
naturally regenerating (e.g. [5,6]), actively planted [7] and intact forests (e.g.
[8,9]). However, rarely have survival and growth of recruiting tree seedlings
and saplings been compared over time across different restoration approaches
(but see [10]) ranging from passively (i.e. natural regeneration) to actively (most
Electronic supplementary material is available commonly planting trees) restored forests [11].
