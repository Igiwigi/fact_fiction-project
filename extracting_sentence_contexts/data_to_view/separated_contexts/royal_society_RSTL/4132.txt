7. From what has now been stated, I believe I am warranted in concluding that
the cells of hepatic parenchyma are the analogues of the endogenous cells or
corpuscles of the glandular vesicles of the pancreas and other racemose glands, or of
the glandular tubules of tubular glands, and are, like them, being constantly repro-
duced, cast off, received into the radicles of the ducts, broken up and resolved into
the secreted matter,

8. But besides establishing this physiological proposition, the fact of the exist-
ence of hepatic cells in the smaller ducts of the liver, throws light on the anatomical
relation of the hepatic cells to the radicles of the hepatic ducts,â€”a point the most
essential in the minute anatomy of the liver, but one which has not as yet been
decisively determined by direct anatomical demonstration, though different hypothe-
tical explanations of it have been offered. 9. The different hypothetical explanations referred to may.
