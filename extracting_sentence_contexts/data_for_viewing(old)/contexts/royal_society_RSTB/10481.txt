To answer the first two questions, we need a compu-
tational technique to detect ‘one-way streets’. Recognizing
that lag threads are simply propagation sequences that
order voxels from early to late, one-way streets can be recov-
ered by looking for correlations in voxel-wise temporal
ordering across lag threads (figure 3d,e). Intuitively, ‘land-
marks’ (e.g. voxels) on a one-way street are always visited
in the same order. Hence, regardless of whether the
one-way street is traversed early or late in a specific path
(e.g. lag thread), the ordering of landmarks will be highly
correlated over all paths (e.g. over all lag threads). When
we compute the voxel-wise propagation sequence correlation
across lag threads, we in fact find topographies of high corre-
lation, indicating the presence of one-way streets (figure 3f).
We refer to these ‘one-way street topographies’ as ‘lag
thread motifs’. Comparing the propagation sequence corre-
lation matrix (figure 1f) against a conventional zero-lag
(functional connectivity) correlation matrix (figure 1b), we

find substantial agreement [42]. Thus, not only do we find
evidence of ‘one-way street’ motifs in BOLD signal propa-
gation, these lag thread motifs match the topographies of
RSNs. Interestingly, the voxel-wise propagation sequence
correlation matrix also exhibits anti-correlations, predomi-
nantly in the off-diagonal blocks. These anti-correlations
