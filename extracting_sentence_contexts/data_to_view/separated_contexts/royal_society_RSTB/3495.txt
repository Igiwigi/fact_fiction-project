WAGER ON THE EFFECT OF GRAVITY UPON THE MOVEMENTS AND

just as well and as quickly in water which has been thoroughly boiled to get rid
of the air, as in water that has been well aérated, so that it could not be due
to variation in the oxygen contained in the water. Nor is it due to air at the
surface, for the aggregation is more perfect in closed vessels from which all air is
excluded than in open vessels exposed to the air. That the oxygen given off by
the organisms themselves is not the controlling cause seems to be proved by the
fact that the aggregation takes place best in the dark, when we may suppose the
Euglena are not giving off oxygen. The presence or absence of carbon dioxide in the liquid appears to make no
difference in the aggregation. JENNINGS states (’97, p. 318) that the crowding of
Paramecium is due to the chemotaxis exerted by the excreted carbon dioxide.
