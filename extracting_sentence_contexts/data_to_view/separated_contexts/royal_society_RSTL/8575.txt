On one occasion we had two buoys and a
Ship in a line, the nearest buoy being two miles from us; we could see the water between
this and the second, and again between this and the ship. It seems to me, therefore, that although in a manner the reverse of what was ex-
pected, our observations this day prove the very great effect which upward refraction
has on the distances at which sounds can be heard. The looming of the distant objects
showed that the air was colder below than above. "This would tend to bring the sound
down and intensify it at the surface of the waterâ€”in fact convert the sea into a
whispering-gallery. No other explanation appears to hold good. The conditions were exactly those which
have been described as favourable to acoustic opacity ; the sea was calm, there was no
wind, and an August 8w was $hining with its full power, and, having evaporated the
clouds, must have been raising vapour from the sea.
