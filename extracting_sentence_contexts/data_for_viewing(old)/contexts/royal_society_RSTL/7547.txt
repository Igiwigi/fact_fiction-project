'= membranes and fluids. This might not be deemed necessary in the comparison of the

S he subjected the brain to the weighing process, divested it of the arachnoid and the
S pia mater. The latter observer might seem to have overlooked the need of any allow-

of the skull with leaden shot, I thus obtain the absolute capacity of the cranium, or
© bulk of the brain, in cubic inches; ” and he describes his great Table as © showing the
S size of the brain in cubic inches ”—whereas, in fact, it merely gives the capacity of 623
A crania in cubic inches. It is quite needless to endeayour to prove that an allowance for
"4 membranes and fluids is absolutely necessary.

£ Attempts have been made by different observers to determine the proportion in weight
= by which the brains of men exceed those of women. "This appears to be variable,

S and posibly the variation may be in relation to particular races; but to decide this
E question would require materials of a very exact nature. 'The proportion differs from
Z about 5 per cent. in our Australians, to more than 10 per cent. in our Tasmanians. It
may be said generally in our series to range from less than 10 per cent. to something
more than 124 per cent., 80 that the propoxal of Professxor WELCKER to regard it as 10
per cent. may for the present be as safe as any other.
