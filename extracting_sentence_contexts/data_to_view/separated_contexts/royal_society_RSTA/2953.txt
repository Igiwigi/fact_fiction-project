Thick blue solid and dashed
curves correspond to the stable and unstable stationary solutions with focusing saturable nonlinearity, and thin red solid and
dashed curves correspond to the stable and unstable stationary solutions with defocusing saturable nonlinearities, respectively.
(a—d) Display the results for the fundamental, dipole, tripole and quadrupole solitons, respectively. Here, parameters in (2.3)
and (2.4) are Vo = 8, Wo = 4, & = 4 and S = 1. In fact, results of more extensive numerical calculations demonstrate that
the relation Wo = (3) Vo, implied by these values, adequately represents the generic situation. (Online version in colour.)

Figure 2. Evolution of profiles of the stationary solutions with the increase of the solitons’ power. (a), (b12), ( 42) and (d;,2)
Represent fundamental, dipole, tripole and quadrupole solitons, respectively, with subscripts 1 and 2 corresponding to the
focusing and defocusing sign of the saturable nonlinearity. Parameters are the same as in figure 1. (Online version in colour.)
