plays an important part in the ingestion of food through suction and is not a mere
tube of passive food conduction.

From Harms’s description and figure (1912, p. 185, pl. xiii, fig. 6), it appears that
the posterior pharynx of the larva of @. canis differs considerably from that of this
species. To me it appears that these differences are more due to his erroneous
interpretation of facts than to reality, as he based his account only on the examination
of a few cross-sections of this organ.

(d) The crop (fig. 9, cr.) —The posterior pharynx passes near the hinder end of the
prothorax into a cone-shaped sac, the crop. The shape of the crop varies according
to the quantity of the food present in it. It extends up to the posterior end of the
metathorax. When the crop is full the posterior end of the posterior pharynx appears
to be invaginated into its anterior end like a stomodaeal valve. The epithelium
(fig. 22, e./.) isin the form ofa syncytium with its outer surface plain and inner surface
irregular and produced into lobes. The nuclei are sparsely scattered and are confined
to the lobulated portions. They are round or oval and the chromatin is condensed
into fewer and bigger granules than those of the nuclei of the posterior pharynx. The
meshes of. the cytoplasmic network are coarser than those of the posterior pharynx.
