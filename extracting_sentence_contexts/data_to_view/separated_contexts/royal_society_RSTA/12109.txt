But the specific motion of the internal ether is not the whole of Fresnet’s hy
thesis ; there is the fixity of the external ether to be verified too. And that has ne
yet been done. In fact, one important experiment, to be discussed later on, throy
grave doubt upon it, at least for large moving bodies like the earth. But unless the fixity of external ether be granted, our argument from densit
concerning the value of the internal velocity breaks down. Consider again ty
planes moving with a slab of matter, one inside and one outside the mass, and ]
the space motion of the outside ether at the‘position of outside plane be affected |
the motion of the slab to the extent yv, then all we can say is that

or, a

wherefore it is possible for « and y to be unity together.
