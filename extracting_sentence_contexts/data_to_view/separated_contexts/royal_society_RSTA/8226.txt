Degeneration of V,°.—Any line of w corresponds to a cubic ®-curve on 1; and since
the line meets /, twice and k, three times, cubic ®-curves must meet c, twice and ¢,
three times. Hence the planes corresponding to points* of c, form a quadric cone V,°,
and those corresponding to points of c, form a cubic locus of planes V,. V;°
is in fact the quadric cone projecting F,‘ from O; and the planes of it in question
meet I’, in cubic curves having nodes at O. ‘The planes of V,? are just those which
meet I’,* in conics ; each of them also meets o in a line ; and any two of them meet on
s, i.e., Vz* has o as double plane. As before, any line of = meets two planes of V;*
(of the system in question) and three planes of V5*, such that the five planes so obtained
form a set of five associated planes. Properties of the Transformation.—Any line of 8 meets M,‘ in four points and II once,
and any ‘’-conic in = therefore meets F,* in four points and so once.
