Series of Semidiurnal tide-waves present in their variations m height and time a nearly
unbroken gradation. When, however, either luminary is out of the plane of the equator, the tide formed on
the nearer side is different from thas: formed on the further side of the earth ; and the
difference depends, not upon its origin being on the further or nearer side of the earth,
but _ _ being situated in the northern or southern hemisphere. Such of the
variations in the tidal movements, therefore, as are due to the fact of their having taken
their ultimate origin from the northern or s0uthern hemisphere, recur every day instead
of every half day; and hence we have a result which, if it could be separated from the
semidiurnal features of the tide, would appear as a diurnal tide. I have now to show how this supposition of an independent diurnal tide agrees with
the observed tidal movements. The diurnal tide being a combination of solar and lunar effects, is swbject to the
recurrence of neaps and springs like the semidiurnal tide, but beyond this it is subject
to a recurrence of changes as the luminaries leave and reapproach the plane of the
equator.
