This figure yields also unmistakeable evidence of the fundamental lamellar
structure of the Madreporarian skeleton. Full-grown coral skeletons often show much larger granulations at the uppermost
part of the calcareous framework than lower down. This is simply due to the fact:
that growth in thickness of the septa, coste, etc., is continued after the coral has
reached the full height which happens to be characteristic for that particular species. During this continued growth in thickness the “ granulations” are the parts of the
skeleton most added to, and they assume a variety of shapes. They very often lose
at the same time their primitively clear arrangement in rows along the course of
“ trabecule,” since they keep spreading sideways, crossways, or lengthways, and
become confused with neighbouring granulations.
