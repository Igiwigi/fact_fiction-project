present-day climate, sea ice takes more than 1 year to transport sediment from all its peripheral
seas to the North Pole. However, in a warmer climate, sea-ice speeds are significantly faster
(for the same wind forcing) and can deposit sediments of Laptev, East Siberian and perhaps
also Beaufort Sea origin at the North Pole. This is primarily because of the fact that sea-ice
interactions are much weaker with a thinner ice cover and there is less resistance to drift. We
conclude that the presence of ice-rafted sediment of Eurasian and North American origin at
the North Pole does not imply a perennial sea-ice cover in the Arctic Ocean, reconciling the
ACEX ocean core data with other land and marine records.

1. Introduction =~

The impact of seasonally ice-free conditions in the Arctic, as predicted for the coming century 3
[1-3], can be usefully constrained by examining periods in the Earthâ€™s history when this has iB
previously occurred.
