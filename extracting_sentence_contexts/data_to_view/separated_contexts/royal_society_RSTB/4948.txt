(Note the short distance on the
stem between these numbers.) From the comparison of the responses of young and older forms, it is evident either
that the plant developes responsiveness to wounding, or that there is an accumulation
of the wound stimulus in the older parts. However the cause of greater accumulation
of resin canals in the older parts of the plant may ultimately be explained, the fact
has a distinct bearing on the phylogenetic interpretation that is sometimes put on the
occurrence of resin canals in cone axes, vigorous branches, etc., of mature trees. In
the case of Picea at least these are the result of wounding, and we strongly suspect
that when the contentious forms themselves are studied more carefully in the light of
the present investigations a similar interpretation will be found to hold. Their sporadic
