The bi-axial hypothesis holds because there is no real evidence against it, that is to
say, it is the simplest statement of the facts of observation (ef. SyKEs, 1910, p. 208). With regard to the floral axis itself, however, the facts are sufficiently simple and
clear, if their interpretation has been often obscure and involved. (1) Two small leaf-rudiments, transversely placed, have been described for a few
cases in flowers at the base of the cone by Licnter and Tison (1912, p. 129), and
these are regarded as leaves, and not mere protuberances of tissue filling gaps,
because they have a bundle-supply; and, according to these observers, the vestigial
bundles may be traced even when these leaves are wanting. There is always a
fundamental objection to the recognition of “ vestigial bundles” formed to supply
