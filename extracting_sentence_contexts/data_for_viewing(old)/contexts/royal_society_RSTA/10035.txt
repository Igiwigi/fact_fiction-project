The difference of height between the slabs was obtained by placing the knife-edges
a, S for one of the beams upon two steel blocks of height 0°5 centim. instead of
Hirectly upon the bed-plate. The bed-plate itself was a solid plate of steel, very
Strong and resting upon two heavy tables T of the same height.

& In the above description no account has been taken of a large number of small

ae which must theoretically affect the method.

© The principal are the following :—(1) In the theory explained in § 2 modifications
will be introduced owing to the fact that a polarizing Nicol is introduced in the path
of the rays of light between the source and the slabs. (2) The source of light is not
a line-source, but a slit of finite breadth. (8) When the load is applied, the middle
part of one beam rises and the other sinks: thus the heights 2, z, and the relative
height 2;—2, in formula (7) are not fixed. (4) The bed-plate P and the tables T are —
not absolutely rigid. This will alter z, and z, but not z,-z. (5) The rays do not go
through the glass horizontally and at right angles to the axes of the slabs, and the
assumption that the mean retardation = retardation at mid-point of path is only an
approximation. (6) The slit used asa source of light is not accurately horizontal.
