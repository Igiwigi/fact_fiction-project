Introduction

e-mail: fujita@fbs.osaka-u.acjp The world we see with two eyes working together is vividly three dimensional. We feel, in addition to understanding, that every object has a particular shape
and thickness, occupies a volume and is separated in depth from others in
space. This sensation of three-dimensionality originates from the fact that the
left and right eyes view the world from laterally separated positions. The geo-
metry creates a tiny horizontal shift between the projections of each visual
feature onto the respective retinae, i.e. binocular disparity. A feature at the fix-
ation distance yields zero disparity; otherwise, the sign of the disparity signifies
whether a feature is in front of or behind the fixation depth and the magnitude
of disparity is approximately proportional to the distance in depth of the feature
from the fixation depth.
