of the cylinder, having nothing to keep it distended, collapses; while the two ends
are prevented from doing the same by the constant movements of the embryonic
vesicles (fig. 74 a).

When the hour-glass form (fig. 74 0) has been once attained, the molecular attrac-

tion of the membrane tends no longer to draw it into a single sphere, but into two
globules ; and thus the division of the yolk is completed.

This view is further confirmed by the fact, that while the first steps of this process
take, comparatively speaking, a long time, as s0on as the hour-glass form has been
once acquired, complete division is effected s0 snddenly that it is invisible; while a
violent oscillatory motion is from the same cause communicated to the yolk masses,
taking some little time to subside.

The division and movements of the embryonic vesicle, on the contrary, can only be
ascribed to vitality.

That this division cannot be produced by the action of the spermatic particles on
Ithe embryonic vesicle, is evident from the fact, that it does not take place from
Swithout inwards, but from within outwards. The embryonic spot divides first ; and
