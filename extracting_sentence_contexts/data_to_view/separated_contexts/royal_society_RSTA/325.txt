This allows the compiler to generate inference code that is
optimized for the particular partition of observed and hidden variables. In some applications, it
might not be known which variables will be observed until run time, and in such cases, the model
can be extended with additional variables that allow for observing the partition at run time. For
example, a model could be extended to include binary variables specifying, for each potentially
observable variable, whether or not that variable is in fact observed. The Infer.NET compiler
encapsulates numerous optimizations regarding the choice of message-passing schedule in order
to generate efficient inference code. Currently, Infer.NET supports two deterministic inference
algorithms (expectation propagation and variational message passing), as well as a Monte Carlo
method (Gibbs sampling).
