except in so far as they may produce changes of osmotic concentration, and, although
these may produce slight to-and-fro movements of water until a condition of turgid
equilibrium is reached, they cannot continually propel it in a definite direction. With
regard to one-sided filtration under pressure, it is only natural that, if water is forced
into a permeable cell at one side, it should escape by filtration through the others,
but this is of no aid in explaining how the forces required for the ascent of water in
tall trees are generated.

Section 28.—The more Rapid Flow through Vessels Completely Filled with Sup
when Subjected to Pressure.

This is the direct result of the removal of the Jammy’s chain from the vessels with
its high resistance to flow. The fact that even then the flow is always slower than
it should be from a viscosity calculation, may be ascribed to the effect of the
irregularities in the interior of the walls of the wood-vessels, and of the presence of
more or less transverse partitions. These factors, together with the change of
conductivity always shown in cut stems, would effectually disguise the existence of a
pumping action aiding in the onward flow, for this would be relatively feeble in a
short length of stem. The same applies to the fact that flow is possible down a stem
as well as up it, while the experiments which showed that the resistance to acropetal
flow was practically the same as to basipetal flow in horizontal stems under similar
conditions, have only been performed on short isolated lengths of terminal branches.

Definite proof that a pumping action exercised by the wood-parenchyma is largely
or mainly responsible for the ascent of water in trees, will only be obtained by
