point Q, for 1790, is found as follows :—

A=260? 0'6+4* 31-4, D=+34 23"4+52 17'2.

These values of A and D are almost identical with those which were deduced by
Orro STRUvE from the combination of his own result with those of ArGeLanDeR and
LuNDAHL.

From the near agreement of these results with the hypothesis, it is manifest that it
would be an entirely useless labour to recompute values of 4/ from slightly altered
values of the right ascension and declination of Q, the corrections of the assumed
values being 80 far within the limits of the probable errors. $0 close a coincidence,
whether accidental or otherwise, is not a little remarkable. In fact the southern
stars would seem to accord with the hypothesis even better than those in the other
hemisphere ; for the mean value of (þ—4/) sin x, or «(F), in respect of the whole of
the stars, is less than the mean found by ArGELANDER from his second and third
classes ; and if we leave out the two stars above mentioned near the pole, it is less
even than that given by his first class, the values for his three classes being respec-
tively 31* 31"0, 32* 366, 35% 416.

It is difficult to form a satisfactory estimate of the probable accuracy of the result.
of this calculation, as compared with the results of ArGELanDER and OrTo STRUVE.
The number of stars, though not large, might perhaps be regarded as sufficient to
render the result worthy of confidence if the proper motions in right ascension and
declination indicated by the comparison of the catalogues could be safely relied on ;
