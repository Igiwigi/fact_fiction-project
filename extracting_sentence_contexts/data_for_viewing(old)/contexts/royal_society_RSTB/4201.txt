when we were chiefly occupied with Helkesimastix, but I have never found it in them since.

to and fro, at the sides of the body. In Spivomonas the rather shorter flagellum
(corresponding to the anterior one) behaves similarly, but the rather longer (posterior)
one is frequently directed backwards and its movement reminds one more of a
boatman propelling a boat by one oar, from the stern. The actual mode of progression
of Heteromastix is easier to recognise than to describe. It progresses quickly, though
not very steadily, rolling or wobbling slightly from side to side, though not turning
over on its axis. Small forms can be distinguished from the small forms of
Spiromonas (before the latter have become spiral) by the fact that their progression
is not so extremely rapid and the individual never goes through more than one or two
fields of a 1/6 lens before changing its direction considerably. Spiromonas displaces
itself more rapidly than any other of these flagellates, with the possible exception of
the darting uniflagellate. It is untiring ; I have never seen it at rest except during
division. Except possibly in the very youngest stages, the course of progression is a
a” spiral, the body turning round on its long axis during the forward movement, now in
S one sense, now in the other. The rotating movement is produced by the action of the
© shorter flagellum, working laterally, helped by the spiral twist of the body in the
= spiral forms. The propulsion is caused chiefly by the more posteriorly directed
oo flagellum.
3 Phyllomitus.—The interesting peculiarity of this form is that the long and short
flagellum, doubtless representing an anterior and a posterior one, are partly joined
