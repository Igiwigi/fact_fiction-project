The recent observations showed that there is a strong
radial magnetic field near the galactic centre [97,98]. Second, the monopoles have a very short penetration length in the matter because they have
strong magnetic interaction. In fact a relativistic electroweak monopole can travel at most only a
few metres (less than 10m) in aluminium before they are trapped [99]. This means that most of
the monopoles left over which did not become the seed of primordial black hole and large-scale
structure in the early universe could have been trapped and filtered out by the stellar objects,
when they collide with them. This strongly suggests that the stellar objects could have filtered out and diluted the density
of the monopoles in the universe greatly, so that the remnant monopole density at the present
universe might have become much smaller than (11.3).
