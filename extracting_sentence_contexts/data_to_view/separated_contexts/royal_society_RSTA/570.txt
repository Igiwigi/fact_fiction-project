The quantity kk’d,/(mA) is very small, so that for practical purposes it can be replaced by
zero in the above three cases. Further, it is likely that #, and £, may each be replaced by
£ without appreciable error in most practical cases. 550 R. A. RANKIN ON THE MATHEMATICAL THEORY

Before passing on to the consideration of Conditions B and G, it may be remarked that the
stability condition usually employed in practice—and, in fact, the only one in regular use
—has not appeared in the preceding analysis. This condition may be stated in the form

Br? +-n2V?2 = fr vV2>0, (8-42-8)

and is obtained when all damping and Magnus coefficients are neglected.
