Extensive and accurate measurements on the excitation cross-sections of hydrogen would
clearly be of the utmost service in the development of the theory since it is an atom for which
exact wave functions are available, and for which, therefore, the formulae of Born and

Oppenheimer can be evaluated precisely; such measurements, too, are urgently required
for various astrophysical applications.

In spite of the difficulties arising from the fact that the element is in the molecular state
under normal laboratory conditions Ornstein & Lindeman (1933) have succeeded in
obtaining some important results. They bombarded hydrogen atoms with electrons of
controlled energy (ranging from 15 to 75eV) and measured the variation in the intensity
of the emitted Balmer lines H (), H(#) and H(y); on applying a correction for cascading
they hence derived the forms of the cross-section curves associated with transitions from the
ground level to the levels of principal quantum numbers 3, 4 and 5. As is generally the case
with excitation functions of a given series, the three curves obtained exhibit close similitude.
The first of them is reproduced in figure 2a, together with the corresponding curve based on
the Born approximation (i.e. using the direct terms only). Though the maxima are slightly
displaced the agreement as a whole is remarkably good. It is rendered considerably less
satisfactory if the exchange terms are included, as in the Oppenheimer approximation, for
these lead to a great enhancement of the theoretical cross-sections at low energies. The
