by a small section-lifter or pair of forceps; the latter are necessary in the case of
the Lepads. ;

Placed in watch glasses the development may be watched from time to time. I

found it impossible, however, to trace the whole history of the development of the
Nauplii in this way, the process invariably ceasing after a certain time for want of
some condition I failed to ascertain, though I tried many methods of culture. Species
perhaps vary in this respect, since Miinrer and BucuHowz (22) succeeded in watching
the whole course of embryonic development in one lamella of Balanus improvisus, Darw.
In consequence of this circumstance I was compelled to examine the ova of a number
of animals found at different stages, in order to complete the account. This was
rendered more difficult by the fact that, as is well known, the ova of the two lamelle
of any animal are nearly always at practically the same stage of development: one
can consequently search for certain stages for a long time without success. Thus,
though I examined the eggs of thousands of individuals of Balanus perforatus, I never
succeeded in obtaining an ovum, the formation of the blastoderm of which had not
commenced, having thus the same experience as Lane, whose account of segmentation
of this form commences when the first blastomere (his ectoderm) is already separated
from the yolk (his endoderm). The mechanical labour of cutting through a solid
shell, such as that of Balanus, becomes in such cases very tedious and occupies much
time, and my best thanks are due to Dr. Este for supplying me with assistance in
this matter. In other forms a number of stages were sometimes found in the same
lamella, as in Conchoderma virgata, which agrees-more with Balanus improvisus in
this respect.
