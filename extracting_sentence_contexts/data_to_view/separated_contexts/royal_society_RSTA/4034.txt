The waviness in case (c) would promote stable (unbuckled) equilibrium
similar to the vibrations stabilizing an inverted pendulum. (Online version in colour.)

elastic rod can be changed in a periodic manner with small amplitude i «1 and frequency 2
about the stationary value Ely such that EI = Elg(1 + h&Q cos Qs) © Elp(1 — hQ cos Qs)7},

The effect of the distributed bending moments is equivalent to a stabilizing shear force V as
shown in figure 2c. Therefore, we conclude that a pattern on the surface profile of a rod affects
destabilization of the rod just as small fast vibrations affect the stability of an inverted pendulum.

(c) Barenblatt’s analogy between scaling of spatial solutions and nonlinear waves

There is another important analogy between the spatial and temporal phenomena in mechanics:
the analogy between the classification of the self-similar solutions of partial differential equations
and phenomena and the classification of nonlinear waves, which was discovered by Barenblatt
[20]. The importance of this analogy is due to the fact that nonlinear vibration and waves
play a significant role in many self-organized emergent phenomena such as Turing waves
(or reaction—diffusion waves) and structures. In many nonlinear systems, it is impossible to obtain
a closed-form solution of the equations of motion; however, it is possible to make judgements
about the asymptotic behaviour of these solutions. On the other hand, the scaling behaviour
and self-similar solutions provide an important tool to analyse spatial behaviour, especially near
various critical points.
