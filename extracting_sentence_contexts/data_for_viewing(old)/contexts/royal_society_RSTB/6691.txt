of the operculated sulcus lies very close to the fissura parieto-occipitalis ; but I
do not regard it as being in any way a sulcus paracalcarinus because the opercular
sulcus limits the area striata throughout its whole length, so that almost the entire
area of the cuneus in this specimen is intrastriate.

FLASHMAN examined this specimen with considerable care. He interpreted the
sulcus retrocalcarinus verticalis as a Y-shaped sulcus occipitalis superior (calcarinus
externus) with its stem detached and extending to the lateral surface. Having
done so, he proceeded to name the medial operculum as the inner portion of the
sulcus lunatus. He goes on to say :—

“That this is really the upper portion of the sulcus lunatus is evidenced by
the fact that the cortex immediately behind it is operculated, and shows a definite
streak of Vicq’ d’Azyr running nearly up to the edge of the fissure. The lower
portion of it which normally lies in front of the sulcus occipitalis superior is
apparently obliterated ”’.

It is to be noted that FLasHMaN says obliterated and does not suggest displacement
dorso-medially. This would suggest that FLAsHMAN regarded the sulcus lunatus as
a structure which might in some circumstances extend from the medial surface to
the lateral border of the hemisphere. If the sulcus lunatus represents the occipital
operculum in the Cercopithecidae this interpretation is justified. It is preferable,
however, in the light of these specimens, to confine the term sulcus lunatus to the
outer part of the sulcus limiting the occipital operculum. The medial operculum
practically corresponds with the sulcus polaris superior of BoLron, and it is found
