There is, on the other hand, no ambiguity about the distribution of charge in the
main portion of the cloud, and the question arises as to the mechanism by which these
charges are produced. The induction process suggested by Wilson (1929) and demon-
strated experimentally by Gott (1933, 1935) is the only theory producing electrification
of the correct sign which has been developed in any detail. Simpson and Scrase (1937)
raise a series of objections to this theory based on the fact that the estimated tempera-
tures in the main body of the cloud are well below freezing point. They conclude,
therefore, that all the larger particles will be ice crystals and that there will be no
particles which can fall more rapidly than the rate at which positive ions are dragged
down by the field. It is, of course, necessary to assume, as Wilson (1929) clearly stated,
that in strong fields the positive ions are of low mobility due to their attachment to
nuclei or cloud particles.
