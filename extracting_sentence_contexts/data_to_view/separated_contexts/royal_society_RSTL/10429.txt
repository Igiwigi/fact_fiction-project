Parvrrr,* and snbsequently and more completely by Mr. CarTer,t this is the
first time that those from the lower greensand and from the other localities above
mentioned in the upper greensand strata have been figured in detail. Mention has already been made of the fact that the spicules of the sponge-beds
referred to in this paper (the Faringdon sponge-gravel not being included) are
exclusively those of sponges with siliceous skeletons. Representatives of each of the
four orders of siliceous sponges occur, but in varying proportions. Monactinellid
spicules of acerate, acuate, and cylindrical forms are very abundant, but, judging
from their relative dimensions, the majority of these spicules belong to the tetracti-
nellide, where they are agsociated with trifid spicules, rather than to those monacti-
nellids whose skeletons are exclusively composed of uniaxial spicules.
