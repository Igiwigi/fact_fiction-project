These phenomena occurred when the photograph was examined with the naked eye,
with the aid of spectacles, or, from a short distance, with a sharply defining telescope by
Ross. Viewed in either of these ways, the brightening was found to begin immediately
beyond the edge of the white paper as it was introduced more or less under the crescent. For the purpose of illustrating this paper on the occasion of its being read before the
Society, TI prepared a representation of one of the photographs of partial phase, 3 feet in
diameter, in which, bearing in mind the well-known fact that there is on the solar disk
a gradual diminution of the intensity of the light from the centre to the periphery, T
Searefully reduced the brightness of the solar crescent in due gradation towards the con-
Sex boundary. In the first instance the background was not painted in, and I expected
Shat when it was completed a brightening would immediately occur. Such, however,
Swas not the case.
= On calling Professor STokss's attention to this failure in producing the phenomenon
>f brightening by artistic means, he suggested that I should renew the attempt by using
Ãž real photograph of the sun and a dark disk for the moon*.
