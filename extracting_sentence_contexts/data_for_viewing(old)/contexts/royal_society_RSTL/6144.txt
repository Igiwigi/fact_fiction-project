a relation which may also be expressed by the equations
&", B", y'=lu+me', IB+mB', Iy+my,

where 7, m are arbitrary multipliers ; and substituting these values in the equation
7 +B"y+y"2=0, we have for the equation of a line subjected to the single condition of
passing through the point of intersection of the lines «z+By+y2=0, e'x+B'y+ Y2=0.
the equation
Z ar+By+12)+m(etn+8y+1/2)=0,

which is, in fact, at once obtained by the consideration that the values of (z, y, 2) which
Satisfy simultaneously the equations az +By+y2=0 and &/an+B'y+y/z=0, satisfy also
the equation in question.

181. The equation of the line passing through the point” of intersection of the lines
«v+By+y2=0 and v3+B'y+y2=0, and also through the point (a, 6, 6), is obviously
«o+By+y2, vabBy+yz |=0,

«a+PBb+yc, va+Bb+yc
which, or the equivalent form
