The subject changes in the two examples, which have identi-
cal thematic role assignments, and, of course, it cannot be
considered as involving the upper layer; apparently, a third
intermediate layer is needed.

Interestingly, there is independent evidence that a specific
extra layer is needed. Consider the two following examples:

(5)a Mary portrayed John.
b Mary’s portrait of John.

Mary and John receive the same thematic roles in (5)a-b,
respectively agent and patient, despite the fact that (5)a is a
clause structure whereas (5)b is a noun phrase. In other
words, predication can carry thematic information but the
identification of subject and predicate cannot be derived
from it (see [10] for an extended discussion).

The second reason for the necessity of an extra layer
comes from a clause involving the copula, which will be
discussed separately in §4. Consider first the following case:

(6) This is [yp Mary’s portrait of John].

The thematic roles of agent and patient pertaining to the pre-
