the members of the ‘Integrating Evolutionary Models of Human
Fertility Change’ meeting for constructive feedback on earlier ver-

demographic transitions towards lower fertility if these repro-
ductive strategies are associated with lower long-term fitness

[80,81]. Similarly, the fact that polygyny and patrilocality are empirical review of the IFS literature. Joe Henrich provided helpful
