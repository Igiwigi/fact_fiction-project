of the host cell is resting upon the parasite and its deep staining reaction indicates
that its disorganisation is beginning. The protoplasm of the host cell is now
reduced to an extremely thin layer upon the wall of the parasite. On the right-
hand side the epidermal cell in contact with the host cell has followed the upward
development of the latter and has subsequently become divided by transverse walls.
This represents an early stage in the upward growth of the ring of epidermal cells
surrounding the host cell which culminates in the formation of the rosette. A slight
enlargement can be detected even in the second cell from the host cell, as the third,
of which only a small portion is depicted, lies at the level of the surface of the
tumour. The width of the outer wall of the host cell represents the original width
of the cell when infection took place. On the left-hand side there are no rosette
cells, and the wall of the host cell is straight, the explanation of both these relations
lying in the fact that the adjacent cell on that side has also been infected ; for it
has invariably been found that when two infected cells adjoin, the common wall is
kept straight by mutual pressure and the two organisms share the one rosette.

Should a single uninfected cell intervene, however, its presence is sufficient to ensure

the formation of an individual rosette for each host cell. The host cell figured

has probably reached its full size, but the prosorus will continue to enlarge until it
fills the lower portion of the cell (fig. 13). In this figure is shown a more mature
prosorus where the contents are about to pass into the host cell. The point in the
membrane through which the discharge will take place lies at the centre of the
portion in contact with the finely granular protoplasmic disc in the upper region of
