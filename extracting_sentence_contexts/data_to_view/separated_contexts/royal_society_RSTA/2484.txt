The basis on which the curves were treated was largely determined by the fact
that the D, H and V curves had to be considered at different times. If a careful
consideration of the curves from all three elements had preceded all measurements,
a common selection of ordinary days would probably have been made. As it is,
a little more disturbance enters into the ordinary day H inequality than into that
for V, and a little more into the D inequality than into that for H.
