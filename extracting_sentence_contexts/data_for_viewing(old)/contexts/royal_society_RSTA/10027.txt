ignited in the open air the burning does not proceed regularly, but is accompanied by

a succession of reports, the tube at the same time being projected about. The action,

in fact, is very similar to that of the “ cracker” firework. 5

a quicker rate than it can get away at atmospheric pressure. The pressure inside
the tube therefore rises to some point at which it bursts out explosively, the tube at
the same time being projected in an opposite direction. This action goes on to such
an extent that holes are often blown through the walls of the tube.

On firing M.D.'. in a gun, when any unconsumed is blown out I have often found
tubes with these holes or splits in their walls. The distance between these holes is
