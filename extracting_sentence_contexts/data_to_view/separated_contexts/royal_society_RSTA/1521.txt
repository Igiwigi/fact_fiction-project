K. the graphs consist of three approximately parallel
straight lines, none of which pass through the zero. From this fact we may draw two
important conclusions, viz. :â€”

(1) That each of the principal susceptibilities follows the Wxiss law y, (I + A) = C (and
not the simpler Curie law x (T) = C) down to about nitrogen temperatures and

(2) the Curte constant C is approximately the same in the three cases, since C is given
by the slope of the curve.
