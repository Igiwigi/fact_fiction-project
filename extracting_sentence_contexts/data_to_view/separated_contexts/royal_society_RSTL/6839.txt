In the prac-
tical application of this scheme of first or primary analysis it was found that, provided
the elected separating value at each station were such as to place in the category of
disturbed observations a proportion equivalent to between one and two tenths of the
whole body of the observations, s8mall alterations within these limits occasioned no
8ignificant alterations in the derived diurnal progression either of the disturbed or of
the (for the most part) undisturbed observations,
The monthly records of a single year at any one of the observatories sufficed to mani-
fest an order and gequence in the ratios of the aggregate amounts of disturbance in each
Q of the twenty-four hours to the mean amount in the twenty-four hours taken as unity,
© Which placed beyond a doubt the fact that, casual and irregular as the disturbances
Z might appear in respect to the particular times of their occurrence when viewed in single
S days, they were in their mean effects strictly periodical phenomena; exhibiting, by the *
E character of their periodical variations, « dependence on the $un as their primary Source. 2 To this important fact the disturbances of each of the magnetic elements, the Declina-
& tion, the Inclination, and the Intensity of the magnetic force, bore concurrent testimony,
Z although the hours of maximum and minimum of their respective diurnal progressions
S were dissimilar; confirming in that particular the inference of the existence of distinct
S periodical laws in the disturbances of each of the elements. 'Z The bearing of this result upon the methods by which magnetical investigations could

Z date, viz.
