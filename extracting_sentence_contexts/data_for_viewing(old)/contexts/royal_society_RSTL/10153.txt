'= made by them on the summit of the Rigi and at Lucerne, the vertical distance between
= both stations being 4,756 feet. Within this stratum 17:1 per cent. of the solar rays
S was absorbed.
2 Experiments were made at the same time at both stations on the perviousness
Z of water to the solar rays. If, as I contend, a vapour and its liquid absorb the game ;
Z rays, the withdrawal of 17 per cent. of the radiation by aqueous vapour must render |
the residual heat more transmissible by water. This is precisely what the French
'S experimenters found it to be. © Through a glass trough 0-08 of a meter in length,
= and full of water, the rays on the Rigi passed in the proportion of 685, and at Lucerne
& in the proportion of 730, per 1,000 of the incident heat.”
Z  Macxvs was 80 convinced of the impotency of aqueous vapour to arrest radiant
£ heat, that in reference to various meteorological phenomena, where the action I had
ascribed to it offered a satisfactory explanation of the facts, he put in its place mis or
< haze, the existence of which he assumed, even when neither mist nor haze was visible.
EZ There are various passages in the Essay on Dew which it would be difficult to
ES reconcile with this assumption; for they show that even visible atmospheric turbidity
E | has by no means the influence which MAGxus ascribed to it.
S Thus on the 7th of January, 1814, WzLLs observed *a little after sunset ” a refrige-
ration of 8%, at a time when some parts of the sky were covered with clouds, and the |
lower atmosphere a little obscure.* On another evening, © when the atmosphere was |
neither very clear nor very still” a difference of 143 was observed between the tem-
peratures of air and 8wan down, WELLS also observed a refrigeration of 5* when the
aky was thickly covered with high clouds. A very definite observation in regard to
haze was made on the 21st of January, 1814. The air at this time was * a good deal
hazy,” Notwithstanding this, the temperature of swansdown placed on snow was j
