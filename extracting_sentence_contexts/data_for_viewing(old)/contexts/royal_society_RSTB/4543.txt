different lines. Thus I regard the vascular system of the ovule of Acmopyle as
homologous with that in the Cordaitalean ancestor, although in the modern genus
the outer set of bundles has become well developed, while the inner has disappeared.

Unfortunately, the question is one that does not admit of a solution by positive
histological evidence of any value. So far as I know, the descending strands have
not been traced into the epimatium beyond its point of separation from the
integument ; on the other hand, it is equally true that they have not been traced
into the free micropylar region of the integument.*

In the absence of direct evidence, therefore, we are left to whatever indirect
evidence may be available from comparisons with other Gymnosperms. Perhaps the
strongest argument against the theory advanced by Srizxs lies in the fact that the
seeds of the Podocarpines, and, in fact, of all the Conifers, conform to the funda-
mental plan of structure of the typical platyspermic seed, and that, for this reason,
such an important difference as that involved in the theory would be a primd facie
improbability.

Thus, two basal main supply strands, situated in the right-left plane, are an
invariable rule throughout the Podocarps, as they are in the Cordaitales, Ginkgo,
and the Taxineze. When there is an inner or an outer system of strands (or when
both systems are present), the strands, if unbranched, always lie in the plane of the
carine (right-left plane), in the Cordaitales, Ginkgo, the Taxineze, and in the only
Pinacese in which they have been recorded, viz., Abies and Cedrus (Rapats, 1894, |
Plates 2 and 6). In those species of Podocarpus in which there are only two
