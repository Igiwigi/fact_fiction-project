With respect to the models already present in literature
(and summarized in §2b), an innovative aspect of the proposed
approach is to include both (i) SDFla and FGF10 signalling
driving primordium locomotion, (ii) SDFla-receptors Cxcr4
and Cxcr7; (iii) the formation, maturation and deposition of
proto-neuromasts; and (iv) cell proliferation. As already com-
mented in §2a, for the sake of simplicity, Fgf/Wnt signalling,
as well as Delta-Notch pathways, involved in rosette for-
mation, were not included in this work. In fact, we have here
opted for a simplified characterization of both cell phenotypes
and relative pseudo-mesenchymal-to-epithelial transitions reg-
ulating rosette formation which allow us to neglect complex
processes occurring at subcellular scales. It in fact allows us
to focus on the dynamic expression of different receptors
within the primordium and the consequent onset of its direc-
tional locomotion. In more detail, the underlying hypothesis
of the proposed approach is that the progressive organization
of PMs into rosette-like clusters regulates both the polarization
of receptors Cxcr4/Cxcr7 along the primordium, and the sub-
division of the placode in a leading portion of PM cell
secreting FGF10 and a trailing portion mainly comprising
cells expressing the receptor fgfrl.
