XIII. On a new phenomenon of electro-magnetim. By Sir
Humynky Davy, Bart. Pres. R. S.

Read March 6, 18253.

Ox a subject s0 obscure as electro-magnetism, and con-
nected by analogies more or less distinct with the doctrines
of heat, light, electricity, and chemical attraction, it is not dif-
ficult to frame hypotheses ; but the science is in a state too
near its infancy to expect the developement of any satis-
factory theory ; and its progress can only be ensured by new
facts and experiments, which may prepare the way for ex-
tensive and general reasonings upon its principles. Influenced
by this opinion, I am induced to lay before the Society an
account of an electro-magnetic phenomenon I observed about
fifteen months ago in the laboratory of the Royal Institution,
and which I have lately had an occasion of witnessing in a
more perfect manner, through the kindness of Mr. Pepys,
by the: use of a large battery, constructed under his direc-
tions for the London Institution, and containing a pair of
