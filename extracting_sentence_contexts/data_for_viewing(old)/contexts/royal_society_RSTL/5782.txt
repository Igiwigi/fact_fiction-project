this 1s successively reducible to
(2+Y)2=(2—Y) =(2—Y)02-(2+Y)
N"(2+Y)2"(2—Y)=N"(2—Y)2"(2+Y)
(1+2”"Y(1—2"Y) =(1—-2"'Y)(1+97Y),

which is a mere identity, and the theorem is thus shown to be true.

then

12. It is to be observed that in the general theorem the transformations or matrices
of substitution for the two sets of variables respectively are not identical, but it may be
required that this shall be 80. Consider first the case where the matrix Q is symmetrical,
the necessary condition is that the matrix Y shall be skew symmetrical ; in fact we have
then

tr. Q=Q, tr. Y=—Y,
and the transformations become
(z, y, 2)=(2"(2=Y(Q+Y)"'QXT, Yp 2),
(x, y. 1)=(2"(2—Y(Q2+Y)"'QFx,, I 4).

hich are identical. We may in this case suppose that the two sets of variables
