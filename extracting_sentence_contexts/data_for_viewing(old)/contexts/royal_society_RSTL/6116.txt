are most numerous, those which one sees on the surface are all spherical or ovoid, but
by degrees they begin to be flattened, and near the end of the glacier there are some
that are 80 flat that they might be taken for fissures when 8een in profile. The drawing.

tig. 10, represents a piece of ice detached from the gallery of infiltration ; all the bubbles
are greatly flattened. But what is most extraordinary is, that far from being uniform, the
Hattoning is different in each fragment ; 80 that the bubbles, according to the face which
they offer, appear either very broad or very thin. IT know of no more significant fact than
this, 8imnce it demonstrates that each fragment of ice is capable of undergoing in the interior
of the glacier a proper displacement independently of the movement of the whole.

+ The same flattening of the bubbles,” continues M. AGass1z, © is found at a greater
depth. While engaged in my boring experiments, I observed attentively the fragments
of ice brought up by the borer. T found in them almost flat bubbles, perfectly similar
to those of the fragment figured above, at all depths from 10 to 65 metres. It follows
hence that a strong pressure is exercised on the interior of the glacier.”

The description of the * flattening” here given is correct : all observers agree in corro-
borating it, and every observer with whom I am acquainted draws substantially the same
conclusion from the phenomenon that M. AGas81z does. Professor 'TnomsoN's specula-
