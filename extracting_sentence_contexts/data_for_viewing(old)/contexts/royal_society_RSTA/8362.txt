Reverse Systems, Y.—In general any prime II of S meets / in a point, O say ; and II
contains two consecutive base points of ® at O. The corresponding Y-primal V is

represented on II by means of quadric surfaces through these consecutive base points,
O, O’ say ; and, in fact, to directions through O in II there will correspond points of
a double line 4 of V—all those directions which lie in a plane through O, O’ going into
the same point of 4. For to any line through a certain point P of 4 there corresponds
the curve of intersection of three quadrics which touch the plane through O O’ corre-
sponding to P ; and since this curve has a double point at O and meets II twice there,
it follows that every point of 4 is a double point of V. Thus every Y-primal, in any of
the transformations {2, 4 (2), n}, has a double line.

Locus of Double Line.—Now it requires one condition to make a ®-quadric touch a
given prime through the plane = at a given point of the line 1; and we may say, then,
that to all points of the section by a prime through = of the neighbourhood of any point
of 1, there corresponds one point of 2. For transformations of class I of the table the
’ locus of such points of = is a quadric surface Q, as appears from the fact that any two
