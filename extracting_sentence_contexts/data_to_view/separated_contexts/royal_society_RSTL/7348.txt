16 PROFESSOR CAYLEY'S SUPPLEMENTARY MEMOIR ON CAUSTICS. For m=1, the double tangent has the two coincident real intersections y=0, or it is
in fact a triple tangent. For m<1>0, the double tangent has with the curve two real intersections, viz. they
are the points where the double tangent meets the circle a*+4*=1.
