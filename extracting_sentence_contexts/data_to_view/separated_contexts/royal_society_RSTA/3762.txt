BecquerEt has shown (‘Comptes Rendus,’ vol. 130, p. 1583) that some at least of
the uranium rays are deflected by the magnet, but he does not seem to have made
any experiments to decide whether both types are so, or only ‘one. In fact, the
radiation is so feeble as to make such experiments very difficult. But it seems
probable that, as in the case of radium, the penetrating type of rays are deflected,
while the others are not so. My experiments were exclusively concerned with the rays from the bare compound,
which consist for the most part of the easily absorbed type.
