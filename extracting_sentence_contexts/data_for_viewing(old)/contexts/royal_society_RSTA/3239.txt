energies.

All values for ยง that are larger than some threshold will lead to a similar stabilizing result.
A special point is reached at ยง = i after which the Higgs starts behaving as a non-fluctuating
massive field and the instability problem is completely removed. As the order of magnitude
criteria for stability, we can use (1.2) and for the instability the point when the potential becomes
monotonically decreasing. The results for various initial values of & at the electroweak scale may
be found in figure 3, which show that the standard model is compatible with large-scale inflation
as long as > 10~? at the electroweak scale.

5. Stability after inflation

The fact that the standard model may be stable during inflation even when H is as large as allowed
by the tensor bound does not mean that a vacuum decay is completely avoided in the early
universe. This is due to the explosive and non-perturbative dynamics which often occur after
inflation has ended and the thermal plasma of the hot Big Bang becomes the dominant energy
component of the universe. This is of course what happens during the reheating epoch.
