As regards functions of a, ay, as, this inequality being satisfied, 4, and ¢, may be
put equal to any functions that may be desired. Like inequalities may be obtained
in respect of the fourth and higher orders.


GENERATING FUNCTIONS IN THE THEORY OF NUMBERS. 153

Art. 59. The important point to notice is that it is legitimate to put the unde-
termined quantities equal to any integral functions of a, @,...,—a fact, for the
general order, that becomes obvious on examination of the above processes.

As subsequently appears, it is such integral functions that usually present them-
selves in arithmetical applications.

Art. 60. As an example of the applications to arithmetic which swarm about the
theory, consider the important condensed form (vide Art. 14) :—
