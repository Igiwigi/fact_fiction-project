(2) The functions IT, Io, 1, [1 (real-analytic in the complement of the bifurcation diagram) satisfy
the relations

2In the domain {(¢1, £2) € R? | e? > — 4¢3}, similar asymptotics for I1(H, 4) and 1(H, 4) hold, where the coefficients a, 6, &, B

are replaced by 2w,8,2d,5 for some real-analytic functions 5, in a neighbourhood of Znyp-


(i) 11(H, a) — IT(H, A) is real-analytic (in a neighbourhood of the point H =0,4 =0);
(ii) 11o(H, 4) = F1.(H, 4).

In fact, the functions /7(H, 4) and /7,(H, A) are not independent. Indeed, as H > 2(—a)9/2/(3./3)
(ie. when the real disconnected regular fibre approaches the hyperbolic singular one) these two
functions have a logarithmic singularity with the same logarithmic coefficient, that is, we have
the following asymptotics:

TI(H, 4) = a(H, 4) In|3V3H — 2(—a)°?| + B(H, A),
TI.(H, 4) = a(H, 4) In |[3V3H — 2(—2)°/7| + Bo(H, A).

In other words, the functions 6(H, A) and £.(H, 4) are different and not related to each other in any
sense, but the coefficients a(H, 4) are the same for both functions. According to proposition 5.2,
however, the regular part 6(H,A) of [1(H,4) does not play any role, so that the only important
information for us is the coefficient a(H, 4) which, as we have just explained, can be ‘obtained’
from /T,(H,A). Hence, we conclude that /7,(H,4) contains all the information we need for
