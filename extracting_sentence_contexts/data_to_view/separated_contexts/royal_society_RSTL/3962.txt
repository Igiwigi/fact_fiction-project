In the depth of the monsoon, near
Mangalore, in 1839, the water was observed to be nearly fresh a mile off the coast ;
and I have seen the Mediterranean discolcured by the turbid inundation of the Nile

already noted one remarkable feature touching the mean temperature of places at
elevations on the table-land of India, namely, that it is much higher than the mean
for the same places, calculated agreeably to MavzR's formula. To the instances he
has cited of this fact, of places on the plateau of the Deccan, may be added the fol-
lowing, occurring on the table-Jand of South India. |
