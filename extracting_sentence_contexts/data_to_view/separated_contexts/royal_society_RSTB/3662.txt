Similar large, stellate, branched pigment-cells, however, may be found
in the dwra mater in situations far removed from the pineal eye, and I have even
seen them in the neighbourhood of the infundibulum, while the fact that such cells
also occur in the choroid coat of the lateral eye is particularly significant in this
connection. In the case of the ordinary (lateral) Vertebrate eye it is, I think, generally believed
that the pigment originates in situ in the pigment epithelium. If so, we should
naturally expect a similar origin for the pigment of the pineal eye, and perhaps the
fact that pigment may appear in the apex of the pineal sac when the latter extends
forwards into the light (figs. 8, 9) tends at first sight to confirm this expectation. On
the other hand, the development of the pigment cannot be entirely dependent on the
presence of light, for it appears in the embryo, both in the pineal eye and in the
pineal sac, long before hatching, while the egg is still buried in the nest.
