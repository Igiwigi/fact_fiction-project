This figure
shows that the sheet current distribution, which is initially produced on the surface,
rapidly penetrates inwards, reaching a depth of some 200 km. within 5 min, The maxi-
mum current density at first decreases as it penetrates inwards, but after a depth of
about 900 km. is reached (in about 6 hr.) it begins to increase again, being, in fact,
proportional to 1/p. Also the speed with which the point of maximum current density
moves inwards now decreases rapidly, being proportional to p%*. The total induced
current is, of course, continually diminishing, so that the maximum gets sharper and
sharper as it penetrates farther inwards.
