other hand, we registered minor rearrangements of sulfonate groups in response to the electric
field, in agreement with standard practice in IPMC modelling that hypothesizes them to be
immobile [1]. The profile of the axial stress along the direction of the electric field carried some of
the footprints of the observed pile-up and depletion phenomena in the counterions’ distribution.
Specifically, results in figure 7 suggest two potential mechanisms through which atom
rearrangements could have influenced the state of stress in the membrane. The increase in the
axial stress between 1 and 2 nm from the anode occurred in the wake of the counterions’ depletion
region, where water presence was minimal. Thus, we attribute this stress increase to the repulsion
between negatively charged sulfonate groups, with fewer counterions and water molecules
shielding their interactions. Such an inference is confirmed by the slightly lower concentration
of sulfonate groups in the neighbouring zones, thereby hinting at larger separation between
molecules because of repulsive forces. The second peak, located 1nm from the cathode, points
at a different mechanism, which should be related to the accumulation of atoms. In fact, the
region experienced an increase in the amount of counterions, as well as more sulfonate groups and
water molecules that rearranged towards them. This local increase of atomic concentration would
bestow stronger interactions, ultimately manifesting in higher stresses within the membrane.
Another key result of the MD simulation is presented in figure 8, where we report the
components of the normal stress perpendicular to the electric field. These components have often
been overlooked in the IPMC literature, which has traditionally hypothesized the existence of a
uniaxial state of stress of the membrane [5,6]. Only recently [47], a continuum model for multiaxial
