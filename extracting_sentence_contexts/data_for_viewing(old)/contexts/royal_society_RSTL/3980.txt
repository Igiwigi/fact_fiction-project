discovered by myself, and described in the tenth chapter of my treatise on the Elec-
tro-physiological Phenomena of Animals. I shall henceforth adopt this denomination,
since it has the advantage of expressing the phenomenon with brevity, and, to a certain
degree, its nature.

I will begin by explaining, in a few words, in what this fact consists, together with
the principal researches which I made in the commencement for the purpose of dis-
covering its laws. Having prepared a galvanoscopic frog, I laid its nerve upon one
or both the thighs of a frog prepared in the ordinary manner ; this done, on applying
the poles of a pile upon the lumbar plexuses of the frog, at the same time that the
maseles of the thighs were contracted, contractions were excited in the galyanoscopic
leg, the nerve of which reposed upon the thigh of the other frog. I discovered the
same fact, placing the nerve of the galvanoscopic frog upon a muscle of the thigh of
a rabbit, and exciting the muscle to contraction by means of a current which
traverses its nerve. I have even seen contractions of the galvanoscopic frog occur
without applying the electric current for the purpose of contracting the muscle which
ought to induce the contractions, adopting for this purpose any other stimulus to the
lumbar plexuses or to the spinal marrow. I finally tried these experiments, introducing
between the nerve of the galvanoscopic frog and the inducing muscular surface very
fine laminz of different substances. A leaf of gold and a very fine non-conducting
stratum of mica or of glazed paper being interposed prevented the phenomenon, that
is to 8ay, the induced contractions in the galvanoscopic frog failed to appear, whilst
a stratum of fine paper soaked in water did not interrupt the induced contraction.
From the whole of these facts I was led to conclude, â€”I1st, that the contraction in-
duced in the galvanoscopic frog could not be attributed to the effect of derived cur-
