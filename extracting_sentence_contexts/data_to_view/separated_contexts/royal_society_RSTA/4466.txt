For v
sufficiently large and cy sufficiently small interpenetration is obtained with the final quasi-one-
dimensional states reaching in size and shape their asymptotic behaviour. For v sufficiently small
and c; sufficiently large, we obtain non-unique results as the outcome of the collisions, whereas in
the range in between these two limiting cases the result of collisions of two quasi-one-dimensional
states is one compound state. The possibility of anon-unique outcome as a result of collisions is intrinsically connected to the
fact that the initial conditions used were not in the quasi-one-dimensional asymptotic state. That
non-unique results might arise for non-asymptotic initial conditions has been briefly indicated
in reference [52], where we used initial conditions for which the quasi-one-dimensional states
were closer together (compare fig. 5a of [52]). The parts of figure 1 showing interpenetration and
one compound state resemble closely those described in reference [52], but are slightly shifted to
larger values of cy.
