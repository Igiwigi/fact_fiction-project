of the skeleton and part of the skull badly weathered. The animal is a little mammal-
like reptile, about the size of a small rat, but with a relatively large head. It took me
some time to determine whether it is a mammal or a reptile. The lower jaw is very
large and almost entirely formed by the dentary, but the hinge is between a small
articular supported by small surangular, angular, and prearticular bones, and a small
quadrate which rests on the squamosal. And though the dentary almost touches the
squamosal it does not articulate with it, and we must thus place the animal among the
reptiles, though it is almost a mammal.

Though the lower jaw resembles considerably that of a Cynodont, such as Gomphogna-
thus, the palate differs very greatly and there can be no hesitation in making this little
animal the type of a new Sub-order, and very little hesitation in stating that from a
member of this Sub-order the mammals have been derived. In fact this new type is much
nearer to the mammals than it is to any previously known Therapsid. In the present
paper I shall only speak of the palate.

Though the palate is imperfect it can be restored with considerable confidence. In
neither specimen is the front of the snout preserved, and the back part of the base of the
skull, though present in both specimens, cannot be safely displayed. The middle portion
of the palate is, however, well seen. There is certainly a large median vomer situated
fairly well forward and completely dividing the pterygoids from each other, as in
mammals. The anterior end of the vomer is lost, but most probably gave some support
to the secondary palate. The pterygoids, so far as preserved, are almost typically
mammalian. The prevomers probably formed a ‘‘ dumb-bell”” bone, which being loose
has become lost, leaving the anterior palatal foramen as a large open space.
