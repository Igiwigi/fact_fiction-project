hear the rockets further than the guns. I was in hopes, however, that as the 8un came
out matters might change, and while in the boat I kept looking out for signs of de-
pression in the distant objects. 'These, however, never came ; they loomed all the time,
and very considerably. From the boat we could sce the water for five or six miles, The
yacht's hull was visible to us all the time. On one occasion we had two buoys and a
Ship in a line, the nearest buoy being two miles from us; we could see the water between
this and the second, and again between this and the ship.

It seems to me, therefore, that although in a manner the reverse of what was ex-
pected, our observations this day prove the very great effect which upward refraction
has on the distances at which sounds can be heard. The looming of the distant objects
showed that the air was colder below than above. "This would tend to bring the sound
down and intensify it at the surface of the waterâ€”in fact convert the sea into a
whispering-gallery.

No other explanation appears to hold good. The conditions were exactly those which
have been described as favourable to acoustic opacity ; the sea was calm, there was no
wind, and an August 8w was $hining with its full power, and, having evaporated the
clouds, must have been raising vapour from the sea.

During the experiment I particularly noticed the echoes. Except the first and only
pistol, none of the reports were attended with echoes or reverberatiom. But in most
cases, though not in all, after calling T could hear the ring of my voice for ten or
eleven seconds; and on one or two occasions when there were boats within half a mile
of us, I could distinctly hear the echoes from them. Without attempting to explain the
