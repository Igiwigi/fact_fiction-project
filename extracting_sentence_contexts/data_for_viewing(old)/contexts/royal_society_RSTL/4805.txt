Saw-fish and numerous other Plagiostomes, as well as of the scale of the Siluroid, we
have what closely resembles ordinary dentine, if not its homologue. In the elaborate
structures covering the scales and occupying the interior of the spines of Ostracion
and of Celorhynchus, we have beautiful examples of osteo- and vaso-dentine. The
tubes which enter from the external surface of the same structures, remind us again
of the very similar tubes, which, as Mr. Tomes has demonstrated, penetrate in like
manner the enamel of the teeth of most marsupial animals. The many varieties of
kosmine which I already possess, leaves little doubt on my own mind that when we
are as well acquainted with the numerous modifications of this tissue as we already
are with those of dentine, it will be found that every variety of the latter has its re-
presentative amongst the former class of structures, When we remember the un-
doubted fact that all these forms of kosmine have been produced by the calcification,
not of a cellular pulp, like that to which the growth of dentine has been attributed,
but of successively added lamellz of purely fibrons membrane, we are bound to admit
the possibility that dentine may have been formed in the same way. So long as the
old opinions respecting the direct influence of cells on the production of the Haversian
systems of mammalian bones were recognized, nothing was more natural than to
account for the growth of teeth by a similar process ; especially since a cellular
structure, to which to refer the process, was 80 conveniently at hand. But now that
the growth of bone is almost universally regarded by intelligent physiologists in
a different light, and bearing in mind that a series of tissues closely resembling
dentine have been formed without the intervention of any pulp-cells, the question
naturally suggests itself, whether the cells of the pulp have any direct connection
with the calcification of a human tooth. I have already pointed out that the * Pulp-
