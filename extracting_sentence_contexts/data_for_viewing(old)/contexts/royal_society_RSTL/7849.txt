attending to the line (y=0, 2=0), this is on the second surface, an oscular line,
== 4*; on the firs surface it is a nodal line, the one tangent plane being
6(4l—&)w.z+drz.y=0, the other tangent plane being 2=0, but the line being in
regard to this sheet an oscular line, 2z=5 a 4. Hence in the intersection of the two

surfaces the line counts (1+3=)4 times; similarly the line y=0, w=0 counts
(1+3=)4 times; and there is a residual intersection of the order (16—4—4=)8, which
is the cuspidal curve; &=8.

133. The cuspidal curye is a system of 4 conics; in fact from the preceding equations
written in the forms

(6d—E, 2(day—cpP), —y*L122w, 1*=0,
(ad—be, 8da*—2cay—by, — 2a 12zw, 1)'=0,

eliminating 2w, we obtain
