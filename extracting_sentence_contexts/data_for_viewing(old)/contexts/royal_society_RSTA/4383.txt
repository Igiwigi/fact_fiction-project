for performing specific networking tasks and protocols. In order to address this limitation, there
is an increasing need for a highly flexible, programmable, protocol- and function-agnostic optical
switching node capable of performing any transport functions as well as network functions
and algorithms. This is further motivated by the fact that many networking functions are being
generalized for their execution over commodity hardware, allowing the distribution of functions
to the most suitable resources in the network.

(a) Bare metal optical switch

The first step for the design and development of an open and programmable optical node is to
leverage on SDN technology to convert a classical optical switch to a bare metal optical switch that
is fully open and can be programmed in an abstracted way by any external control mechanism.
We define a bare metal optical switch as a classical optical switch which is SDN enabled, i.e.
without any integrated control software and equipped with SDN-enabled control interfaces. This
allows the configuration of the switch with any external (third party) controller. As shown in
figure 2a, we propose a novel optical SDN agent (see details in ยง4) that sits on top of any classical
