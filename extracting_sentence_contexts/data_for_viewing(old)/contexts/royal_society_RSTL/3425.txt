to it had existed ; but it never bears upon it the smallest mark of the transverse strize,
or of any regular marking, unless, as does occasionally happen, some few fibrillze, or
parts of them, remain adherent to it. But this very rarely happens, the whole of the
fibrillee usually evincing a greater facility of separation from the sheath than from
one another, A few are seen thus adhering in fig. 75. a.

The inner surface of the sarcolemma, however, is naturally adherent to the outer-
most fibrillze, and most probably in a particular manner*. From some appearances
frequently presented by the fasciculi of insects at their margins, and of which an ex-
ample is given in fig, 70. a, it would appear that this adhesion takes place to the most
prominent parts of the fibrillze, or, in other words, to the rims of the transverse dises
which result from their union. The outer scolloped line in similar cases has no doubt
been often mistaken for the outer margin of the fibrille. It is, in fact, indicative of
the bulging sarcolemma, which is bound down to the prominent extremities of the

intervening fluid. Now in this specimen the interior of the fasciculus is in focus ; a
