which the eyeball rests, is the serial homologue of the folds behind the mouth. F

That is to say, the palatine fold (*superior maxillary rudiment,” © maxillo-palatine
fold”) appears to be the morphological equivalent of the folds next following, in
which are developed the mandible, hyoid arch, and branchial arches. I do not think that this is invalidated by the fact that the * hypoblast ” ceases
inside the first post-oral fold, for the hypoblast ceases at or near the anal aperture, yet

of cells, deeply pitted ; this is the nasal gland, the pit is its * lumen ” or future duct,
and the tissue over and under it will be the vomer and septo-maxillary. The massive palatine fold is separated by a notch from the outer nasal fold (ma.p., ol.)
and this part shelves inwards towards the base of the still membranous cranium ; the
thin, inner part will contain the palatine bone.
