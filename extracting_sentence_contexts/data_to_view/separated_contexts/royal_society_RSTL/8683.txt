fig. 34, of the epithelium of the stomach of the frog). Considerable differences
of length will also be met with in the epithelial cells of the intestine of mammals, partly
due to the presence of structures which will be discussed hereafter, under the title of
« Epithelial Buds” (8e Plate 39. fig. 13), and partly due to the fact that the epithelium
covering the upper surface of the villi and the upper surfaces of the processes in the
large intestine is much shorter, as a rule, than elsewhere. On examining the projections of the mucous membrane in a section of the yermiform
process of the rabbit, fine, almost thread-like processes from the dark line on which the
epithelium rests may be seen running among the epithelial cells. . This dark line (se
figs. 9 and 13, 7), as we shall sce afterwards, is due to the sectional view of the con-
nective-tissue reticulum, which lies surrounding the epithelial cells, and on which
they rest.
