Lyme Regis. This contains some extraordinary ridge or dome-shaped limestone pro-
tuberances which project from the underlying limestone H 4 at high angles (figures 9 and
11, plate 1). It is inconceivable that such structures could have remained unsupported on
the sea floor. In a few cases these prominences can be observed to lie on the line of
small faults in the immediately underlying White Lias and basal Blue Lias (figure 9).
Tarrâ€™s suggestion (1933) that the Lower Lias nodules are primary in origin must therefore
be rejected. The CaCO, segregation must have been comparatively early-stage for, as
Richardson (1923) first pointed out, it precedes the compaction which crushed fossils in the
shales.

The most important problem to be faced concerns the conditions under which uniform
bands of lime mud were subjected to diagenetic changes which resulted in the formation
of nodular limestones or bands of nodular concretions. The following facts must be
accounted for. Laminated limestones are always planar, and nodular structures are
confined to the normal type. Seams of laminated limestone as thin as 3 mm have been
observed (in H 1, Dorset), but normal limestones are never less than 3 cm, and thin
normal-type limestones in a thick shale sequence (e.g. laqueus sub-zone, Glamorgan) are
generally represented by strings of nodules. Nodular structures in a given bed are similar
in size and more or less equally spaced over a wide area. Although it is generally true
that less fossiliferous limestones tend to have planar surfaces there is no intimate relation-
ship with shell content. More often than not nodules or nodular protuberances do not
contain fossils at their core.

Presumably the obliteration of fine lamination by organisms permitted greater ease of
migration of CaCO ,. Usually, however, this would take place only under the influence
