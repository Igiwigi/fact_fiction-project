This could be because observers are each nor- an efficient neural code requires a good match between
malized in a different way (perhaps because they are the limited stimulus range over which the neural
adapted to different colour environments), but could responding is strongly graded on the one hand, and
also be because they adopt different criteria for label- the distribution of natural stimuli on the other. It is
ling a stimulus as white. In fact this distinction is inefficient to waste discriminative ability on extremes

central to the debate over cultural versus biological of the stimulus continuum that are seldom encoun-
determinants of norms for colour attributes like basic tered; but it is also less than optimal to neglect unusual

colour terms [153] or for facial attributes like attrac- cases totally, by devoting all discriminative capacity to
tiveness [154]. Adaptation provides a means to test just the most typical stimuli (near-whites, or nearly
these alternatives [119,155]. If the norm corresponds average faces).
