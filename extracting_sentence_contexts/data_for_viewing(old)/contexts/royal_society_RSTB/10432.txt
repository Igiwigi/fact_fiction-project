should not be possible if yellow constitutes the background.
Also, red patterns appear as both modifying the background
yellow and foreground black patterns. Alternatively, we could
consider black to be the background and red/yellow to be the
pattern, as has been typical in the evolutionary genetics litera-
ture [33]. Consistent with this, in the hindwing of both
H. melpomene and H. erato, and in the H. melpomene forewing,
optix places red elements onto an otherwise black wing. How-
ever, NGP homologies among the wing patterns of other
butterflies are less clear in this hypothesis. Additionally,
WntA expression patterns described above do not agree with
yellow as pattern. Neither hypothesis is consistent with the
fact that optix sometimes controls red patches that correspond
to ‘background’, while in other cases it controls red patches
that are ‘pattern’, nor that sometimes red overprints yellow,
yet sometimes yellow overprints red [60]. Instead, we suggest
that the distinction is not meaningful: there is a hierarchy of
factors that interact by both activation and inhibition of down-
stream factors. Optix is a paintbrush that can be co-opted to
colour wing regions already outlined by any part of this
upstream patterning landscape.

It has also been argued that NGP elements develop
independently in each wing cell, with wing veins acting
as landmarks during development [61]. However, WntA
