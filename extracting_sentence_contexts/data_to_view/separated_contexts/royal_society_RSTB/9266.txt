In species with a polygynous
mating system where body size is a significant predictor of
outcompeting conspecifics, rewards of being somewhat
larger than conspecifics could be much larger than a few per
cent. It follows that individuals, especially males in sexually
dimorphic species, may evolve in a direction that increases
the incidence of cancer. On the other hand, the result also means that body size evo-
lution can be associated with a substantial cost of reduced
lifespan due to cancer (despite the fact that most causes of
death may remain non-cancer related). If there are other costs
of being large [7], then cancer risk may well tip the balance
from further increases being favoured to being counter-selected. In reality, ‘all else is not equal’ with respect to at least two
parameters: wand k.
