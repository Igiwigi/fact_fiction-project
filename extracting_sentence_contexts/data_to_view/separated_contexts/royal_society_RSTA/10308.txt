Experiments were also made with the chlorine in both tubes treated similarly—both
tubes darkened or illuminated before the admission of hydrogen. The contraction
observed was similar in the two tubes, and so the initial increase in the case of the
tube with insolated chlorine is due to the fact that the chlorine has been influenced
by the light. These experiments were frequently repeated with different conditions
of illumination, and in every case the phenomena were as in the experiments just
tabulated. AND CHLORINE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF LIGHT. 108

No difference in the initial rate of combination could be detected if the hydrogen
was first illuminated, and then mixed with chlorine in the dark, and the mixture
exposed to light,

If the chlorine be exposed to light in a separate vessel, and then introduced into
the burette through the water and mixed with hydrogen, the behaviour was as if it
had not been exposed to light at all.
