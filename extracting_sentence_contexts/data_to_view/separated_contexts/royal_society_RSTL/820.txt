Supposing them however to be
combined, the greatest effect on the mean result of any one
set of experiments might amount to about 0,3 of a vibration
in 24, hours, and the difference between the number of vibra-
tions in either position of the pendulum, might have been
double this quantity, and yet when the great weight was
below, not have differed from the truth more than 0, of a
vibration. It appears then, that if the experiments have been con-
ducted with sufficient care, no greater difference should be
found between the mean, and any one of the resulting lengths
of the pendulum contained in the preceding table, than might
have been occasioned by a difference of 0,30 f a vibration in
24 hours, and this is found to be about 0,000g of an inch. In fact, on referring to the table we perceive that the expe-
riments A and D, which differ most from the mean, give, the
one, 00029 of an inch zz excess, and the other ,00026 in defect. In considering the sources of error, it may not be unneces-
ary to remark that had the bar of the pendulum been made
too thick, and the knife edges not been placed accurately at
right angles to it, an error, though very minute, might have
arisen from the effect of the obliquity in diminishing the dis-


92 Capt. KaTkR's experiments for determining the

tance of the centre of oscillation from the axis. This was
sufficiently guarded against by having the bar 80 thin as to
ensure its becoming perpendicular by its. own weight, had
the position of the knife edge been in a small degree erro-
neous ; for though the form the 'bar would assume is strictly
speaking a curve, it may without sensible error be considered
as a straight line.
