the slope of which # may be deduced. In this way # may be determined for various orienta-
tions, and it is possible to see whether or not it varies in proportion to £/E, as found from
the period, i.e. whether or not E, has the same value for all orientations. At the highest
fields and lowest temperatures 2n2kT/SH occasionally becomes small enough to make the

difference between exponential and sinh (see (5) and (1)) appreciable, and the logarithmic
plot ceases to be linear. As will be explained in the detailed discussion later (see p. 15) this
situation can be dealt with by a process of successive approximations. Another consequence
of a sufficiently small value of 272k 7/fH is the presence of harmonic components, and we
shall see that these have in fact been detected experimentally in gallium and graphite.

The next comparison with theory is as regards the field variation of the amplitude of the
oscillations; it is appropriate to plot log aH! against 1/H. The slope of the straight line gives
2n°k( T-+-x)/f, and, knowing the value of f from the temperature variation, « can be deduced.
The value of x may thus be found for any curve of anisotropy against 1/H which extends
far enough, and important points of interest are to verify that it does indeed have the same
value for the same orientation at different temperatures*, and also to see how it varies with
orientation and impurity content. On the basis of such results the interpretation of x in
terms of equation (6) may be discussed. Further evidence on the validity of the theory
comes also from a study of the variation of amplitude at a given field strength with orienta-
tion and with impurity content.
