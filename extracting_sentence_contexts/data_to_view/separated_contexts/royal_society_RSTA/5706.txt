These dislocation densities are 10-20 times larger than the listed experimentally measured
dislocation densities [20,6366]. As discussed more thoroughly in the Introduction section, there
are several sources of error in the experimental evaluation of dislocation densities that can,
to some extent, explain the discrepancy between the MD and PFC-AE simulations and the
experiments. The discrepancy can be related to the fact that some dislocations can annihilate during cool-
down, and this cool-down is not simulated in this paper. Moreover, solidification velocities are
somewhat higher in the MD and PFC-AE simulations than in typical AM or melt spun conditions,
as indicated by the larger grain sizes in the experiments. Larger solidification velocities in the
simulations are likely to pronounce the formation of dislocations.
