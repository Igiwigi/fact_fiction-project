If
these inner ridges had enclosed the water tube the hollows should extend right under
the casts and leave these casts suspended in the groove. Examination of the moulds
shows this to be the case. In fact the per-radial casts, representing the main water
vessel, are only kept in position by the lateral supporting casts, shown also in the
photograph, representing the branch vessels to the tube feet. It is now possible to understand the rubber impressions. If from natural causes
the supports of the per-radial mud casts have disappeared, or if artificially we remove,
by a needle, a portion of a mud cast, we get a rubber impression showing the entire
depth of the internal ridge.
