In either case the simpler constituent molecules have only
to arrange themselves one by one on their identical partners in the original molecule, and
then become linked to each other by the absorption of suitable quanta from radiation or
from second order collisions. That such autocatalysis is possible is indicated by recent work
in Russia and America, where the regular atomic arrays of metallic catalysts are shown to
operate like laceworkers frames on which simple organic molecules settle to be joined into
larger aggregates. A two-dimensional reproduction of this kind is impossible, owing to the
fact that the constituent amino acids in nature are not symmetrical, but exist in right or left
hand forms. Two-dimensional reproduction would lead to mirror image molecules, which are
not found in nature. There remains then only one dimensional reproduction.
