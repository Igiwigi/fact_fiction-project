Our estimate for the timing
of the primary interordinal radiation of placental mammals
that Meredith et al. [9] date at approximately 83 Ma, falls
close to the 66 Ma K-Pg boundary, with 95% highest pos-
terior densities of several major clades—including
Euarchonta, Eulipotyphla, Afrotheria, Euungulata (artiodac-
tyls, perissodactyls) and Ferae (carnivorans, pangolins)—
overlapping this boundary. We note that our divergence time estimates agree fairly
well with a recent phylogenomic study using a rich set of
‘soft’ node calibrations [10], but our estimates tend to have
more uncertainty associated with them. The increased uncer-
tainty is not due to the fact that we used a smaller molecular
dataset than dos Reis et al. [10]. In our analyses, effective
branch lengths (measured in expected substitutions per site
or character) in the extant tree were estimated with high

precision (e.g. electronic supplementary material, figure Sic)
and were almost invariant across models. Thus, almost all
of the dating uncertainty comes from other parts of the
TED model.
