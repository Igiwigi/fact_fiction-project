FROM ORDINARY DAYS OF THE ELEVEN YEARS 1890 TO 1900. 251

There is obviously a considerable “ accidental” element in the results for individual
months, especially in the shorter period-waves. There is, however, an unmistakable
seasonal variation in the phenomena in the 24-hour term in H. In the summer
months, the difference, though small, is clearly positive, whereas in winter it is not
merely negative but very large, exceeding an hour of time. The fact is the seasonal
variation in @ in H is much more pronounced in ordinary than in quiet days, the
monthly values showing a range of 97° in the first case as compared with 71° in the
second. $
