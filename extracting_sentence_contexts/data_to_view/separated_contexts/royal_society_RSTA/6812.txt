Ife<0, a different transformation formula is obtained; —v must be interpreted as v exp (im). In fact, the hypergeometric function possesses branch-points at 1 and infinity (Copson 1935,
chap. 10), and the transformation formula is valid in the whole plane only when cut along
the real axis from 1 to +00. E, thus has a singularity at v = 1, that is, where Y = 1—iZ. If Z = 0, this occurs for a real value of the height z, and for values of z greater than this,
the value of E, is ambiguous (by this method of solution).
