CHURCH ON THE FLORAL MECHANISM OF WELWITSCHIA MIRABILIS. 133

(2) Time factors in development indicate relative rates of growth, and do not give
absolute evidence of initiation unless the construction is symmetrical and centric.

(3) Nothing is gained by trying to force the andrcecium into a decussate system
conformable with the perianth. There is no obligation whatever for so doing nor
any advantage to be demonstrated by continuing the floral phyllotaxis system from
the vegetative shoot into the sporophylls. As already noted, there is nothing
particularly valuable about a decussate system ; in fact, we obtain a much wider view
of the flower of Welwitschia if strict decussation can be shown to be wanting. Its
real history is undoubtedly much more complicated than such a simple standpoint
would admit,

On the whole, the evidence of the six stamens being anything more than they
at first appear, a single whorl of six equal members, does not seem in any way
conclusive ; it was founded on the developmental figures of McN AB and Srraspurcer,
the mistake of which will be explained later; and, so far, the andreecium may be
accepted as a whorl of six stamens, tangentially extended in the specially flattened
flower, and not conformable to the preceding perianth, but a separate construction,
indicative of a special andreecial region of the flower, with a certain individualisation
of its own, but here found in the form of a certain almost minimum reduction phase,
just as the true perianth is a minimum of two members. The interpretation of floral morphology, as based on much of the older develop-
mental work, is often extremely vague and unsatisfactory, and the suggestions above
quoted would perhaps not be so unconvincing if there were not an accurate parallel
already at hand and under common observation.
