Applied to our example, the question is about the possibility of replacing (2.4) with [ze

f(A) | f(A) c=1
f(A) | fa(H) || ¢=2

f(A) f(A) |] c=3 *

g=1|q=2)q=3

(5.2)

At every measurement, the variable H has some value, and all six random variables, irrespective
of what context c is being factually measured, are determined by this value. At that, the values of
any two random variables measuring the same content are always equal (because the functions
are labelled by their contents only). It is easy to see that this is precisely the same as the existence,
for any factual measurement, of the assignment of values to all random variables in the system,
such that Ri = RE for any q € Qc N Qe. Of course, in CbD, (5.1) has to be replaced with

Ro ~ fa(H) = Say 6.3)

ie. (5.2) represents a coupling of the system rather than the system itself.

This completes the demonstration that the three meanings of (non)contextuality considered in
this paper are subsumed by the notion of a coupling in the CbD sense.
