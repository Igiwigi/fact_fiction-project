In all the above cases, excepting No. 2, the depressions are quite unnecessarily
deep for the purpose merely of seeing the stars distinctly. Spica or 8 Tauri could
have been seen setting in the morning twilight with a solar depression of 8°.

Two explanations may be offered with respect to this alteration of the element of
the sun’s depression. One is, that attention had been called, as it hardly could help
being called, to the fact that the heliacal star failed to keep its original connexion
with sunrise, and that there would be a better chance of permanence if the interval
between the two bodies were increased ; the other is, that the temple service had
become more complicated, and that more time was required by the priests for
preparation, Every additional degree of sun’s depression would add about five
minutes for this purpose.

+ The festival of the Thesea is supposed to have been held on October 8 and 9.

}¢ The autumnal return of the sun to the same point of the Erechthenm would take place on
September 2. There does not appear to be an heliacal star available for that occasion, but the great
festival of the Niceteria in honour of the victory at Marathon is considered to have been held on the
3rd of that month, when the sun would shine fully along the axis of the temple.
