the effect of all the keyways is the sum of their separate effects.

Another important point which is brought out by the above results is that the
effect of such a keyway upon the torsional rigidity is by no means simply proportional
to the depth of the keyway, but increases according to some much more rapid law.

Thus, for the ellipse « = 7/6, the depth of the keyway = ‘123 (semi-major axis),
For the ellipse « = 7/2, the depth = *601 (semi-major axis), Thus, when the depth
of the keyway is only decreased to one-fifth of what it was before, the reduction of
torsional rigidity falls from 23 per cent. to 1 per cent., or nearly in the ratio of the
squares of the depths of the keyways.

This result may explain the fact that, when keyways of only moderate depth are
cut into shafts, the decrease of torsional rigidity is by no means so great as would
have been inferred from Dr SAtt-VENANY’s results for a circular section, with a thin
keyway or slit extending right up to the centre.

If we suppose, which appears reasonable, that the effect of such a slit upon an
ellipse, which is not very elongated, does not differ much from the effect on a circle,
we see that a keyway, whose depth equals about one-eighth of the radius, will decrease
the torsional rigidity by only about 1 per cent.

Now, when we make « =, we get the case of the circle with a keyway going
right up to the centre. The reduction of torsional rigidity is then 44 per cent. about.
