+ See, for example, Kelley, McShane & Reno (1949?, chapter 12). With the exception of a few extra factors,
such as acceleration damping and jet damping, the conditions for stability after burnt differ very little from
those which apply during burning, and the analysis of § 8-2 may be used with only minor modifications. The

chief differences which appear arise from the fact that, due to gravity, Z does not remain small throughout
the motion, and consequently sin @ is no longer small.

Since w,/V is small by Assumption A 1, we need only examine the forms of &( and 5”.

If we consider the amplitude of H® it is clear that a necessary and sufficient condition

for & to remain small is that CaF
