C. SEWARD ON A PETRIFIED WILLIAMSONIA FROM SCOTLAND. 119

structure, there are many reasons for believing that this Lower Oolite fossil
represents an inflorescence very closely allied to that of Bennettites Gibsonianus.”*
The recent work of Prof. Naruorst,t so far, at least, as regards the female organs,
and it is these with which we are alone concerned, has not revealed any facts
necessitating a modification of this opinion. It is by no means easy to decide
between Williamsonia and Bennettites as the more appropriate generic designation
for the Scotch fossil. The question of Bennettites versus Cycadeoidea is hardly
germane to the present discussion, as we are dealing with a detached fertile shoot,
and, whatever force there may be in the arguments advanced by Warp and
Wietanp in favour of the latter and older name for Mesozoic trunks bearing fertile
branches, the use of BuckLaNnn’s genus (Cyeadeoidea) would be inappropriate in the
case of a single strobilus.
