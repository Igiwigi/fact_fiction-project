The names Paleoanthropus, Hoanthropus, Pithecanthropus, and Sinanthropus
are at once useful and distinctive, the last one particularly so since its derivation is so
obviously zoogeographic, carrying with it no implication of preconceived relationship. Ideas regarding the latter must necessarily change from time to time as new evidence
becomes available. When, therefore, definite morphological facts permit, it would seem
desirable to accord generic status of zoogeographical significance to a new discovery
of truly ancient hominid remains, and thus to avoid at the outset prejudicing or rendering
obscure the ultimate issue of their precise relationship within the hominid group. BIBLIOGRAPHY. Norr.â€”In
