EB The three last-mentioned fibres (d), (e), and (f) thus take the same course.

3 Two fibres (g, 20 », and h, 20 2) alone remain, and they turn abruptly downwards

4 and outwards to curve down ventrally between the entering anterior and posterior

ie Barve, and end in two large unipolar celis of the ventral cell-plate on the same side

$ corresponding in position to the cell of the opposite side in which fibre (a) ended.
= Each gives off a branch to the dorso-lateral plexus as it passes near it. They thus

E "= completely resemble fibre (a) in their connections, except in the fact that they do not

& © decussate.

3 The following table summarizes the connections of the descending column of the
$ posterior dorsal nerve on each side.
ie Tt will be seen that the fibres fall in three groups defined by distribution and size.
