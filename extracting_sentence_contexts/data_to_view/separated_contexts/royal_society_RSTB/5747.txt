Fie. 32.â€”Comparison between maxillules, maxilla and 1st trunk limbs of larval Conchostraca (above
x 175) and adult Lepidocaris (below x 350). appear at the hind end; that is, an Hstheria passes through a larval stage in which
the number of trunk limbs is the same as that of, e.g., Sida. In fact, a larval Estheria
with six trunk limbs looks like a Cladoceran, as at this stage it has biramous swimming
antenne, the head is not yet enclosed in the shell, and the adductor muscle has not
yet come into play to produce the laterally compressed adult form. The Cladocera
may thus be regarded in a sense as pedogenetic Conchostraca. They are sexually mature
larval Conchostraca exhibiting larval characters in the type of swimming antennz,
the carapace, the number of trunk segments, and now, we may add, in the maxilla.
