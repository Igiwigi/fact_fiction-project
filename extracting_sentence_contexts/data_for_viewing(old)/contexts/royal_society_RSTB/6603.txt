has arisen through the change of a fusiform initial into a series of ray initials, and
subsequently grown by division of the cells till it exceeds its original storey in height.
The growth of these rays can be traced through the whole 9 cm.; at the end of the
series they are seen to be 4 and 5-5 storeys high respectively, and to have acquired
a complete layer of sheath cells. The increase in size has taken place in two ways, by
cell division and by the conversion of fusiform initials to ray initials, and their addition
to the existing cell complex. Growth in height has been gradual, except in Fig. 19 (3),

by swelling and subsequent division of the apical initials, which push their way in
among the surrounding elements. This accounts for the fact that increase in height
is, for the most part, independent of the storeys. The exception to this is between
Figs. 19 (2) and (3), where one of the small rays is seen to have jumped a complete
storey by the addition of a whole converted fusiform initial.

Figs. 17 and 20 show similar stages in the addition of a layer of sheath cells to a ray
of Tarrietia utilis SPRAGUE. The distinction between the marginal and sheath cells is
very noticeable in this species, as the procumbent cells of the ray are usually filled
with dark contents. In figs. 17 and 20 the cross-hatching represents the dark contents
