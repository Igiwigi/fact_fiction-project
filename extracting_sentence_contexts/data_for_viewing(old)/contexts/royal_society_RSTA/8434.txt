THE DEFERRED APPROACH TO THE LIMIT, 307

It is seen that-this is a special case of our /?-extrapolation. Suepparn’s fact that the
coefficient is — ;'; for curves of all shapes that satisfy (5) is indeed remarkable. If
instead f(«) =1 when —a <a <a and f(z) = 0 elsewhere, then a theory, familiar in
connection with moments of inertia, shows that the coefficient is still 1, but with the
positive sign.

As a detailed illustration in marked contrast with the frequency curves to which
Suepparn’s correction is applicable, we may take the frequency y defined by y= a*
when — 1 =#=1 and y=0 elsewhere. Instead of high contact at the ends of the
range it has discontinuities.

If now the range between «= —1 and «= +-1 be divided into 7 equal sub-ranges
each of h, so that h = 2/n, and the area under the curve in each range be treated as if
