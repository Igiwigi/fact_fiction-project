no strong conclusions can be drawn from these limited tests,
we believe this approach is likely to be very powerful for
further tests of these ideas, as it can tie experimentally vali-
dated differences in transformation rates to the number of
mobile elements carried in a given genome.

3. The potential for consensus

Despite the numerous studies of competence across a broad
swath of competent bacterial species, there still remains con-
siderable uncertainty about its function because no single
explanation seems to capture the particulars of different species
growing in different contexts. And this may in fact be the
answer: as with eukaryotic sex, a plurality of explanations
must be considered [77]. While Haemophilus may become com-
petent when it is hungry or to repair DNA damage,
streptococci, H. pylori [36] and L. pneumophiliae [37,78] may
only do so when they are damaged, while A. baylyi [42] and
Neisseria meningitidis [79] are constitutively competent
(although not necessarily all cells in the population at the
same time). However, a consensus option may lie in the fact
that not all transformable DNA is of equal appeal or value to
each bacterial species. Most obviously, non-homologous
DNA is a poorer substrate for recombination than homologous
