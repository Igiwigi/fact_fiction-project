the breadth of the glacier in this place (see ground plan, Plate VIII. fig. 1.). Even an
inspection of the curves (Plate IX. fig. 2) can faintly convey the impression made upon
my own mind, when upon the 26th of August I placed the theodolite for the last time
over station Q, and caused the vertical wire to pass in front of the line of pins bent
into the convex $shape by the relative motion of six days' continuance. Thus seen in
foreshortened perspective, the eye would in an instant have seized an abrupt motion
or discontinuity of the line, but © the appearance of the curye they formed was beau-
tiful ; the whole line of pins was deviated from the usual line QQ1 by an angle equal
to 12:45 inches, seen at a distance of ninety feet, or about 40', and besides this, the
pins lay in a beautiful and nearly continuous curve, presenting its convexity towards
the valley, and decidedly without any great step or start. This was beautifully seen
when I directed the vertical wire of the theodolite upon the forty-fifth pin and caused
it to describe a vertical plane*#. I observed however a curious fact, plainly indicated
by the numerical results ; the curve crossed the axis at the fourth pin, and attains its
greatest convexity at the twenty-fifthþ.”

Fourthly. That no information might be wanting as to the precise condition of the
mass of ice under experiment, I made a very minute examination of the state of the
transverse line with respect to the occurrence of flaws in the ice. The most import-
ant of these was one which returned into itself, crossing the line towards the origin
of the glacier between the twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh marks, and returning
backwards between the fortieth and forty-first without extending further upwards.
Such a flaw, even if devoid of cohesion, could only act by allowing the piece of ice
contained between the twenty-seventh and fortieth mark to slip bodily forwards,
