Class 8a. Iron and Manganese with low Carbon.—With 15-27% manganese in steel
No. 1379D/2, the effect of low temperature in increasing the tenacity is still further
reduced, but the rather low ratio of increase is, as in No, 4147/104, 1-04°%, Mn,
maintained the same, at about 1-2, in liquid hydrogen and in liquid air. Also, although
its ductility at ordinary temperature was only 5%, it still retained 24% in liquid air.
The effect of manganese cannot, therefore, be regarded as completely unfavourable.

Class 8b. Iron and Manganese with higher Carbon.—In the presence of a higher
carbon content, as shown by steel No. 1010, the behaviour of iron-manganese alloys
seems little different, except that at liquid air temperature the loss of ductility is much
greater. 'The small increase in tenacity obtained with a low carbon content is further
reduced and, in fact, wiped out, immersion either in liquid air or liquid hydrogen causing
very little increase or decrease in tenacity, the ratio of unity for this specimen thus
being again preserved with little loss in passing from liquid air to liquid hydrogen.

This specimen, 1010, represents the well-known manganese steel discovered by
one of the authors, and the striking change in this extraordinarily tough material when

immersed in liquid air, to one almost devoid of ductility, was commented upon at the
time of the previous research. This change is all the more mysterious because all other
austenitic non-magnetic steels so far tested have, when given their appropriate previous
