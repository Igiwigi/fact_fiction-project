HARDY ON SOME FEATURES AND PROPERTIES OF

nerve fibre from the inter-ganglionie commissure to where it breaks up into a bundle
of fibrils which are lost in the fine plexus. We must therefore look upon this
structure as the place where the fibres of the nervous system ultimately communicate
with one another. Lastly, the nerve fibrils passing to the fine plexus enter it in well-defined bundles
which go to histologically distinct regions, and this structural feature we may
correlate with the fact that each nerve contains different groups of fibres which
supply either different muscles, or regions of the sensory surface supplied by the
nerve as a whole, which differ in the fact that stimulation of the one region or the
other does not produce quite identical disturbances in the central nervous system. DEescriPTION OF FIGURES. Part I.â€”Branchippus.
