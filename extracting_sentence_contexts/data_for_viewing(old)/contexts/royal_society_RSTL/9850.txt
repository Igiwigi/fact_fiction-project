clearly that this is a mistake, as is obvious from the fact that even in transverse
sections these rays are s8een to be very much more numerous than the foliar bundles.

What gives an interest to this frequent occurrence of barred cells in the medullary
rays of these exogenous Lycopods is the fact pointed out by De Bary (*Vergleichende
Anatomie,” p. 505), thab amongst living plants such cells are chiefly confined to the
medullary rays of Gymnosperms and especially to the Abietina,

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS RESPECTING THE CARBONIFEROUS LYCOPODS.

I think T am justified in expressing my conviction that the present memoir confirms
the views I have 80 long advanced, viz. : that at leass many of the Lepidodendroid
plants acquire, through advancing age, those characteristics thab have hitherto been
relied upon to distinguish the Sigillarian from the Lepidodendroid forms. In his
latest memoir, already quoted, M. RExAuLT combines his fossil Gymnospermous
Phanerogams in one group, to which he gives the common name of *Diploxyl6es,”
and in a foot-note (oc. cit., p. 260) he 8ays : © Sous ce nom je reunis toutes les plantes
