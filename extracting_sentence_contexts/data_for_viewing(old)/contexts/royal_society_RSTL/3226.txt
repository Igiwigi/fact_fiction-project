1. Tye following researches originated from some experiments which were
undertaken to discover an improved method for ascertaining the quantity of nitrate
of potassa existing in crude saltpetre. After several unsuccessful attempts the action
of hydrochloric acid was tried. The fact, that nitrates are decomposed by this acid,
has been long known; but the nature of the resulting compound of potassium has
not, 80 far as I am aware, been hitherto determined. LI anticipated that the nitrate
would be decomposed into chloride of potassium. To decide the question some pure
nitrate of potassa was mixed with hydrochloric acid, and the mixture heated ; while
at common temperatures no perceptible action occurs, but immediately the acid be-
comes hot, decomposition commences. Chlorine and nitrous acid are evolved with
copious effervescence, and the nitrate slowly disappears. The solution was gradually
evaporated to dryness, and the dry salt treated with an additional quantity of acid
until decomposition was no longer evident. The resulting salt was then carefully
examined, and it was found to be pure chloride of potassium. This experiment was
repeated several times, and all the results concurred in satisfactorily establishing the
fact, that nitrate of potassa may be perfectly converted into chloride of potassinm,
