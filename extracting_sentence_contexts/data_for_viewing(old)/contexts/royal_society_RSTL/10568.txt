ON THE MIXED HERBAGE OF PERMANENT MEADOW. 1345

total mixed herbage, Poa pratensis is perhaps the most uniformly predominating,
Festuea ovina and Agrostis vulgaris coming next in this respect ; the one or the other
Â© being relatively the more prevalent in the different separation-years according to the
characters of the season. A number of other graszes have, however, generally con-
tributed a fair proportion to the herbage ; thus, Holcus lanatus has yielded a consider-
able average percentage and actual amount, Dactylis glomerata about the game average
proportion, but with more tendeney to increase, Avena elatior also has shown consider-
able tendency to increase, whilst Anthoxanthum odoratum has yielded a small but not
greatly varying quantity, and Alopecurns pratensts less s8till., On the other hand,
DE whilst Poa pratensts has much increased in both percentage and actual amount, Pog
Strivialis has, in a considerably greater degree, diminished, in fact almost become
Sexcluded ; and, whilst Avena elatior has greatly increased, A. pubescens and A.
= flavescens have each very greatly diminished, indeed almost disappeared. Of the other
grasses which have gone down in this struggle among free, luxuriantly-growing, stem-
Sforming, and maturing species, are Bromus mollis, Lolium perenne, and in much
Zemaller actual quantity Festuca pratens's.
& Under the influence of such gramineous luxuriance, as already said, the Leguminose
S occurred in mos insignificant amount, 80 much 80 that it is of little interest to go
Zinto any detail as to which of such 8pecies was the mos persistent and prominent,
thyrus pratensts was 80, indeed, but in most immaterial quantity each year. Ononts
-S arvensis, which may be designated as a weed, gave, however, the largest, though a
Svery small percentage and actual quantity, in the last separation-year. There was, on
the average of the four 8eparation-years, only between 10 and 11 lbs. of total legu-
