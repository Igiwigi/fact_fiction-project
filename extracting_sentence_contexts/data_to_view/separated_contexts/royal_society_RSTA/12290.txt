Both these metals were
subjected to the heating and cooling process for several days, but neither of them
exhibited any tendency to diminish either in permeability or dissipation of energy. Nor again did rest assist in the “accommodation” which can be produced by
repetition of the cycle. Iron, therefore, seems to be unique, both as regards the
accommodating effects of rest, and of the heating and cooling process.t

The limit of magnetising force within which the values of A and B are constant
(Table VII.) for different ranges of force, can be considerably raised by the heating
and cooling process; thus the limit in the case of the iron wires last-mentioned was
raised from 0°1 to 0°4 C.G.S. units.

* This did not arise from the fact that the length of the steel rod did not contain the diameter @
sufficient number of times. A much longer piece of the same rod gave exactly the same values of
A and B.

+ This seems to be also true as regards the accommodating effects in torsional cycles. STRAIN ON THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER. 855
