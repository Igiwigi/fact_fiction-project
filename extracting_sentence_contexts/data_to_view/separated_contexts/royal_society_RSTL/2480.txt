Scarcely a stronger confirmation than
this very circumstance, of the universality of metamorphosis, could be adduced : for
if there were any exception, it would be in the terrestrial species ; but no, they are,
when first hatched, incapable of living out of water with swimming members; hence
the parent is impelled by instinct to seek that, element for its progeny which Nature
has designed for the whole of the tribe to which they belong. Having lived amongst
West Indian islands, where these facts were constantly before him, neither he, nor any
other person, could invent any plausible reason for this curious piece of economy.‚Äù In the fifth and last place are to be noticed Mr. Tzowyson's general statements. In the Addenda to his second number he states that he has had a confirmation of
his views in one of the West Indian land Crabs, and in some other of our most widely
Separated native genera, authorizing his previous assertion that the greater number
of the Crustacea do actually undergo transformations, of which, in addition to the
facts adduced in his first memoir, further instances will be given in future memoirs.
