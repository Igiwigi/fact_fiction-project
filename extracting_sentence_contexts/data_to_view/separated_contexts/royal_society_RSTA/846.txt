Such substitution is correct because the function h(r — r’) depends not on the form
of the solution but on the shape of the interface ¢;. The kernel (8.6) has the constant a(r’), which is obtained by integration of the delta function
along the phase interface,

ar’) = I. alr — Gin))d@, (6.11)

where r’ = ¢;(r) is the equation of the complete interface and 2 is the liquid region enclosed by
the boundary ¢;, i.e. the region enclosed by the solid/liquid interface ¢s,, and three infinite lines
defined by x + +00, x > —oo and z — oo (figure 4). For instance, if the interface is a circle with
radius Rg, then 1’ = Rg is the polar coordinate (scalar) that gives

2 ove}
a(r’) = I, d¢ I, 8(r — Ro)rdr = 27Ro. (8.12)


The constant «(r’) appears due to the fact that the argument of the delta function has a null value
not in one point (for which the constant a(r’) = 1) but on some manifold. In our case, this manifold
is represented by the one-dimensional curve (given by the interface) as well as at infinite points. In obtaining equation (8.4), we have used the transition of the integral with infinite limits for
the entire domain ¢; to the integral on the interface ¢s,,.
