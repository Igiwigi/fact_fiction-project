they 8eem generally to contain a clear colourless fluid with a variable number of small
molecules 8uspended in it. In A. lumdbricoides the contained fluid is frequently of a
reddish colour. Although the body of the ventral glands is generally quite filled with
granular matter, still in the terminal portions of their duct I have frequently seen
amongst the free Nematoids a clear fluid with 8nspended molecules. I have especiallf
noticed this in Symplocostoma longicolle.

I am fully impressed with the homological identity of these modifications of an excre
tory organ, as met with in the Nematoids, with that system of vessels in the Trematodl
and other animals, which, from its invariable communication with the exterior, has been
termed a © water-vascular ” apparatus. As I shall have again to allude to this subjech
when treating of the affinities of the N ematoids, I will now merely call attention to the
following facts:—that in both Nematoids and Trematodes the nature of the contents W
this system of canals is the same, whilst in Distomum tereticollef, as in A. lumbricoideh,
the fluid has been seen of an exceptionally reddish colour; that in some species of Tres
matodes, such as Monostomum faba, Distomum, cirrigerum, and Gasterostomum fimbriatuml
there exists in connexion with the external aperture only a simple ac; in others, such
as Distomum chilostomum, D. clavigerum, D. conjunctum, D. luna, 8&c., as well as in geveral
Species of the genus Monostomum, it is a bifurcated organ ; whilst in Anh
comoum | four main branches exist, although each of these sends off an infinity 0!
offshoots.

I have «till to speak of two varieties of vessels met with in the Nematoids, which
