above 1007, with three times its weight of strong hydrochloric acid. The chloride of
methyl, formed under these circumstances, quickly yolatilizes when the tube is opened,
and by careful evaporation, 'over lime and sulphuric acid, a- crystalline residue may be
obtained, whence it is possible to remove completely the excess of hydrochloric acid ;
but it has not yet been further investigated.

Action of Hydriodic Acid on Hemipinic Acid. â€”Hemipinic acid is decomposed, when
boiled with concentrated hydriodie acid, into carbonic acid, iodide of methyl (boiling-
point 42*8 C., vapour-density 5:05; calculated yapour-density 4:92), and an acid of the
formula C, H, O,. Tt will be seen that the composition of this acid is intermediate
between that of salicylic acid, C, H, O,, and that of gallic acid, C, Hy O;, and, as will be
seen by the description which follows, it is analogous to these acids in some of its pro-
perties. Accordingly, in order to recall the fact of its containing one atom of oxygen
less than gallic acid, we propose to name it provisionally hypogallic acid, reserving to
ourselves to suggest, if posstble, a more appropriate name when its chemical relations shall
have been more thoroughly investigated. The reaction, by which these products are
formed, takes place according to the equation

Hypogallie acid, when pure, is,only slightly soluble m cold water, but dissolyes easily
in hot water, alcohol, and ether; its solntion reacts strongly acid with litmus-paper, It
Separates from hot water in small prismatic crystals, united into stellate groups, and-
