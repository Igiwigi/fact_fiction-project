Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Toronto (Canada) and
from the University of Wyoming (USA) explain the modern analytical methods
for detecting EDCs and other organic micro-pollutants in water and wastewater,
and Prof. Walter Giger and colleagues from the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic
Science and Technology (Eawag; Switzerland) describe the occurrence and fate
of phenolic EDCs in wastewater and receiving waters.

Pharmaceutically active compounds that pass through the human body are
transferred to wastewater and subsequently to receiving waters and drinking
waters, owing to incomplete removal of these compounds by conventional
treatment processes. In fact, it is not only over-the-counter pharmaceuticals that
can be found in the environment, but also illicit drugs, as demonstrated by Dr
Ettore Zuccato and Dr Sara Castiglioni of the Department of Environmental
Health Sciences of the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research (Italy)
in their review paper. Dr Mira Petrovic and colleagues from the Department
of Environmental Chemistry, IDAEA-CSIC and partner institutions (Spain)
discuss the fate and removal of these pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs by
conventional and membrane bioreactor wastewater treatment, as well as by
riverbank filtration, which is often described as a more ‘natural’ approach to
treatment.

Many classes of organic micro-pollutants are removed, to a certain degree, by
the activated sludge process in wastewater treatment, whereby the pollutants are
