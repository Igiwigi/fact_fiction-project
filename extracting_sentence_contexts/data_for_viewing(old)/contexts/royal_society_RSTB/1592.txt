& its peculiar articular process. ‘Then again, in most Siluride with normal bladders, it is
EI the radial fines of the tripus which cause that ossicle to move inwards towards the

their relatively feeble development and nearly straight antero-posterior course, Is

the elasticity of the articular process. As in all probability the tripus is to be
regarded as the modified transverse process of the third vertebra it will at once be
obvious that if presents a striking resemblance to the corresponding process of the
fonrth vertebra, In each case there is a flexible and elastic root directly coutinaous
with the neural arch of its vertebra and in distal continuity with a movable plate
of bone—the body of the tripus in the one cnse and the oval plate of the “ elastic-
spring” apparatus in the other. The fact may also be recalled that as regards the

thinness of its root and the curious obliquity of its origin from the neural arch the

transyerse process of the fifth vertebra, although neither Hexible nor elastic, strongly
resembles the two preceding processes.

In reference to the movements of the tripus if seems to us not improbable that the
relation of its erescentic process to the slit-like groove between the oval plate and the
