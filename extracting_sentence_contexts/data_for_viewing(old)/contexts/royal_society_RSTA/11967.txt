Tn comparing our results with those of other observers, we have in the first place to
consider the value which Mr. Grrrriras has obtained in his very excellent series of
measurements, His final result (‘ Proc. Roy. Soc.,’ vol. 55, p. 26; Phil. Trans., vol, 184,
1893, A., p. 361), is

J = 4°1982 (1 — ‘000266 @— 15) x 107.

This refers to the nitrogen thermometer. At a temperature of 19°1 the value
would be reduced to 4°1936, which corresponds to our 4°1905 at the same tempera-
ture. GnirrirHs’ value is to be increased slightly owing to the fact that he really
measures the difference between the specific heat of water and of air. This would
increase the value of J by ‘0011 about, so that the value of J at 19°1 would be
raised to 41947 x 107’, which is exactly one part in a thousand larger than ours.
The difference is small, but must be due to some systematic error, as both GrrrrirHs’
value and our own agree so well with each other, that ordinary observational errors
and accidental disturbance could not have produced so large a difference in our
result. The least satisfactory part of a calorimetric measurement must always be
the cooling correction, and we have considered it of great importance to reduce that
correction as much as possible. The uncertainty of the cooling correction does not
necessarily depend on its value; thus, we can much diminish it by starting, as we
have done in our last series, with the initial temperature of the calorimeter about as
much below that of the water-jacket as the final temperature is above it. Yet the
