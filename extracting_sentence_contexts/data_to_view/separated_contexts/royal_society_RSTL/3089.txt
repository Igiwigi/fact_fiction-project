I
endeayoured to devise such experiments for first proofs as should not include transfer,
but relate altogether to the pure simple inductive action of statical electricity.

1217. It was also of importance to make these experiments in the simplest possible
manner, using not more than one insulating medium or dielectric at a time, lest dif-
ferences of slow conduction should produce effects which might erroneously be snp-
posed to result from induction in curved lines. It will be unnecessary to describe
the steps of the investigation minutely ; I will at once proceed to the simplest mode
of proving the facts, first in air and then in other insulating media.

1218. A cylinder of solid shell-lac, 0'9 of an inch in diameter and seven inches in
length, was fixed upright in a wooden foot (fig. 3.) : it was made concave or cupped at
its upper extremity 80 that a brass ball or other small arrangement could stand upon
it.
