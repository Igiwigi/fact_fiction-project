Summary of Observations on Colour-blindness,

We have now described in some detail the results obtained from the obseryations of
four persons who. are more or less colour-blind. It may be assumed thab H and R
are totally blind to the red, and the curve of their red deficiency is therefore of more
than passing interest, more especially as they 80 nearly agree in characteristics. An
examination of their curves leads us to suspect that the colour entirely wanting in
their colour perception is a red which lies about 43:6 on our scale, and would appear
to us of a crimson hue, The fact that the red and blue deficiency curves meet at Þ
is also instructive. In G we have an example of partial colour-blindness to red, his
curve showing that he is not entirely insensitive to red radiation, but that the
perception of it is damped in some peculiar manner. We may mention that some
near relatives of his have the same peculiarity of vision.
