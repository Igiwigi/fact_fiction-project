This paper, therefore, is not controversial, but contains further facts
and proofs of the truth of Ds 1a Rive's views. The cases Martanint puts are of ex-
treme interest, and all his objections must, one day, be answered, when numerical
results, both as to intensity and quantity of force, are obtained ; but they are all de-
bateable, and, to my mind, depend upon variations of quantity which do not affect
seriously the general question. Thus, when- that philosopher quotes the numerical
results obtained by considering two metals with fluids at their opposite extremities
which tend to form counter currents, the difference which he puts down to the effect
of metallic contact, either made or interrupted, I think accountable for, on the facts
partly known respecting opposed currents; and with me differences quite as great,
and greater, haye arisen, and are given in former papers (1046.), when metallic
contacts were in the circuit. So at page 213 of his memoir, I cannot admit that e
Should give an effect equal to the difference of þ and d; for in þ and d the opposition
presented to the excited currents is merely that of a bad conductor, but in the case
of e the opposition arises from the power of an opposed acting source of a current.

1805. As to the part of his memoir respecting the action of suIphuretted solutions+,
I hope to be allowed to refer to the investigations made further on.
