Dentilucina Fischer, 1887 (Man. Conch. p. 1143); type species: Lucina jamaicensis Lamarck,
Recent; monotypy.

Remarks. The acceptance of Lucina pennsylvanica (Linné) as the type species of Lucina
Bruguiére necessitates the consideration of the valid name to be used for the L. jamaicensis
group. Blainville’s use of ‘Phacoides’ was colloquial and adjectival (as was pointed out by
Chavan (1937, 81, no. 2), who, nevertheless, used it). Agassiz’s use of the name seems to be
a nomen nudum as suggested by Neave (1939-40), since it is a mere quotation of Blainville’s
use of the word ‘Phacoides’, in spite of Sherborn’s interpretation that it refers to something
different from the form referred to by Blainville. The first valid use that I can find of the
name Phacoides is that of H. & A. Adams, who use it in a proper generic sense as a synonym
of Lucina Bruguiére, giving L. jamaicensis Spengler as an example of the genus. The fact that
the type species of Lucina Bruguiére is not the species mentioned by H. & A. Adams as the
example does not appear to mean that Phacoides must necessarily remain as a synonym of
Lucina. The only species mentioned by H. & A. Adams in the first valid use of the name
becomes the type by monotypy. This interpretation seems best, and has the added advantage
of retaining a name that has been well known in the past as applying to the L. jamaicensis
group of shells. The writer has shown elsewhere that the name Anodontia Link, which has
been applied by Stewart (1930) to this group of shells, actually refers to those species
previously referred to the genus Loripinus Monterosato.
