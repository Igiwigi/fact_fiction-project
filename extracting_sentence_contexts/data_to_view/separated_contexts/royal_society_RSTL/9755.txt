rate of rhythm. either of ventricle or auricles is produced ; the rate of the auricular
beats continues the same ; the ventricular beat follows upon each auricular with the
game regularity as before, and, in fact, as far as the rhythm is concerned the ventricle
might not have been heated (Plate 67, fig. 2). That the heating was effective, however,
the figure clearly shows, for the force of the ventricular contractions is markedly
diminished during the time that the muscle was heated : a fact of considerable
importance, as proving that heat acts upon the muscular tissue of the heart in such a
way as to diminish the force of its contractions apart altogether from the rapidity of
the rate of rhythm of those contractions. Q This experiment seems to me positive proof that in the whole heart the rhythm is
Q que to discrete impulses proceeding from certain motor ganglia to the muscular tisse,
S each of which impulses causes a contraction of that tiszxue. Further evidence to the
= ame eftect is given by a series of results which may be generalized as follows :-—
= Any influence which, applied to the auricles and sinus alone, eauses an alteration

S while the same influence, applied to the ventricle alone, causes no initial alteration in
& the rhythm either of ventricle or auricles.
