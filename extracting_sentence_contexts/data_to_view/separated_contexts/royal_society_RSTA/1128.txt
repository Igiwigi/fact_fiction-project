the tooth is a pure translation, a case which we shall discuss later.) We have then

Xeferring to (70), we see that K/K has a simple interpretation ; if we replace the
section of the membrane by a fictitious wire whose linear density is equal to 1/h®, then
K®/K® is equal to the square of the radius of gyration of this fictitious wire about the
centre of rotation O. Accordingly. by (74) and (65). we may state this result :

THEOREM V.—In the general two-dimensional problem, the points of the membrane
at which the pressure p has maximum and minimum values are situated on a cirele whose
