attempts to solve these equations by retaining the time as independent variable, and
gubstituting for & and N approximate values, but they were all unsatisfactory, because
of the high powers of & which occur, and no security could be felt that after a con-
giderable time the solntions obtained did not differ a good deal from the true one. The results, however, were confirmatory of those given hereafter. The method finally adopted was to change the independent variable from # to E.
A new equation was thus formed hetween N and &, which involved the obliquity z
only in a 8ubordinate degree, and which admitted of approximate integration, This
equation is in fact that of conservation of moment of momentum, modified by the
effects of the solar tidal friction. Afterwards the time and the obliquity were found
by the method of quadratures. As, however, it was not safe to push this solution
beyond a certain point, i was carried as far as seemed safe, and then a new 8eb of
equations were formed, in which the final values of the variables, as found from the
previous integration, were used as the initial values.
