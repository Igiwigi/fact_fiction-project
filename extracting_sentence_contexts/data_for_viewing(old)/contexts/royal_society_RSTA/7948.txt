Fic. 19—Drawing of C,A — C,AF surface. Showing trace of C,S — C,A — C,AF plane cutting
T,R and T,Q at « and § respectively. Arrows show direction of falling temperature.
N.B.—Actually the surface does not lie in one plane (see fig. 20, Plate 1). The figure

represents a projection on to the horizontal.

The C,S — C,A — C,AF plane is drawn slightly displaced to the right of its true position for
illustration purposes.

For point T, to be a eutectic it should fall within region (ii). In fact, however, it

may lie just within region (ii) or (iii). The composition given (CaO 54-8%, Al,O,
22-7%, SiO, 6-0%, Fe,O, 16-5%) is within region (ii) but the position is such

that if the point had the composition (CaO 54-9, Al,O; 23-1%, SiO, 6-0%,
Fe,O, 16-0°), which is within the experimental error of determination, the point
would lie practically on the C,S—C,d—C,AF plane and a little lower iron
content would bring it into region (iii). It is, therefore, not possible definitely to
assess T, as a quaternary eutectic. IfT, does fall in region (ii) and is a eutectic,
