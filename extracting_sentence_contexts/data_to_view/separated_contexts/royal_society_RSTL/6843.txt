These columns occupy different
2 portions of the left yentricular cavity, and give a very good idea of the symmetry which
prevails throughout the left ventricular walls. Lastly. The apex is opened into and enlarged, and the auriculo-yentricular orifice
widened, by the removal of consecutive external and internal layers, from the fact of
the left ventricular cavity tapering in two directions and forming a double cone. There are other points worthy of mention, such as the construction of the septum,
fleshy pons, and conus arteriosus, the varying thickness of the right and left ventricular
walls, the shape of the right and left ventricular cavities, &. To these, however,
allusion will be more conveniently made subsequently.
