(77) The functions of the olivary bodies have been the subject of much discussion
amongst physiologists of different ages. Wis, I believe, was the first who considered
them as the central organs of articulate speechF. BUurDAcn and REv2us regarded them

as subservient to both speech and expression. DuGEs and SOLLY have adopted
opinion of W1L11s. Sgrres concluded, from pathological facts, that the-olivary bg
influence the movements of the heart. According to him, isolated and chronic alter
tions of these bodies cause a jerking and irregular action of the heart*. * He als fc

I concluded, on anatomical grounds, that these bodies are probably the coordinati
centres for the different nuclei of the medulla oblongata; that is, that they are t|
motor and associating agents by which the different complex moyements dependent ©
the medulla are carried on. SCHRODER VAN DER IKOLK concluded, both from anatc 0
and pathology, that the olivary bodies are subservient chiefly to articulate speech a

speech, in which these bodies were more or less altered in structure. Two excee
interesting cases of the same kind have come under my own obseryation.
