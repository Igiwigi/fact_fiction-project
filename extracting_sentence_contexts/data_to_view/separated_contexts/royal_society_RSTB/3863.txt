At Harcott, the Sweet Coals crop out. The
Sweet Coals thus, obviously, lie in a fold, and the simplest explanation of the
whole matter doubtless is that an unconformity exists between the Sulphur and
the Sweet Coal Series. At present, however, owing to the very small number
of sections and pits existing in the Wyre Forest, it is not possible to demonstrate
the fact by a careful correlation of pit sections, as has been done in Coalbrookdale
by Crarkr* and Scorr.t On the other hand, it does not seem possible to explain
these facts by reference to faults. Faults of greater or lesser importance
undoubtedly occur in the Wyre Forest, as in all coalfields, though very little is known
about them at the present time, and, except in one or two cases in the Highley
District, they are not apparently of much importance or dominant as regards the
structure of the coalfield, so far as can be ascertained at present. Very little attention has hitherto been paid to the lithology of the Wyre Forest
measures, but from the descriptions of the rocks passed through in borings and
sinkings it is obvious that they are very varied as regards their physical characters.
