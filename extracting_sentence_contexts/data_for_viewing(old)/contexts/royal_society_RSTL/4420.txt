passes through the same intermediate oblique positions into the transverse position ;
or if the crystal be raised, the same transitions occur; at any less distance the changes
are the same, but later. They occur more rapidly when the crystal is raised than
when it is lowered ; but this is only because of the unsymmetric disposition and in-
tensity of the lines of magnetic force around the magnetic axis, due to the horse-shoe
form of the magnet and shape of the poles. If two cylinder magnets with equal
conical terminations were employed, there is no doubt that for equal amounts of
elevation or depression, corresponding changes would take place in the position of
the crystal.

2618. These changes however are not due to mere diminution of the magnetic
force by distance, but to differences in the forms or direction of the resultants of force.
This is shown by the fact that, if the crystal be left in its first position, and 80 point-
ing with the length axially, no diminution of the force of the magnet alters the
position ; thus, whether one or ten pair of plates be used to excite the magnet, the n
distance (2616.) remains unchanged ; and even descending to the use of an ordinary
horse-shoe magnet, I have found the same result.
