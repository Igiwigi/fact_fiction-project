The liming of ture, followed by its translocation below ground into
oceans may also offer some important opportunities plant roots [26]. Partly under genetic, nutritional and
there [19] (and see http://www.cquestrate.com/). hormonal control, roots can extend to varying depths,

and thereby deposit carbon as root biomass. Probably

more important is the fact that roots exude all kinds

3. THE MAIN PATHWAYS OF CARBON of carbon-containing components into the rhizosphere
SEQUESTRATION AND RELEASE IN SOILS [27], a complex and imperfectly characterised zone
There are four main steps in a systems biology approach containing numerous microbes (including mycorrhiza
to understanding complex networks [20,21]. Steps 1 [28,29]).
