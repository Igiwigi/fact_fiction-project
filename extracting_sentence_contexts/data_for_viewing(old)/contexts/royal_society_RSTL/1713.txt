nution of the mixture, at about the same rate as atmospheric
air is diminished by nitrous gas, when the former is admitted
to the latter in a narrow tube.

SECTION II.

ON THE EFFECT OF FINELY DIVIDED PLATINUM ON GASEOUS
MIXTURES AT INCREASED TEMPERATURES.

The effect of varying the proportion of free hydrogen to
the compound combustible gases, on the degree of action
which is excited by the platinum sponge, will perhaps admit
of being explained, by examining the facts that have been
stated, in connection with the degrees of combustibility of the
compound gases under ordinary circumstances. The precise
degree of temperature at which any one of them burns is
not known, on account of the imperfection of our present
methods of measuring high degrees of heat. It has been
ascertained, however, by Sir Humenry Davy,# that at a heat
between that of boiling mercury, and that which renders
glass luminous in the dark, hydrogen and oxygen gases
unite silently, and without any light being evolved; that
carbonic oxide is as inflammable as hydrogen ; that olefiant
gas is fired by iron and charcoal heated to redness ; but that
carburetted hydrogen, to be inflamed, requires that the wire
