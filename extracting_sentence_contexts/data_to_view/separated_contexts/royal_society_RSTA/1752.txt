The motion of the system can now be expressed in the form

and we could conduct the variation directly were it not for the fact that our functions
are not all expressed explicitly in terms of the independent co-ordinates of the
systems, which are in reality the position co-ordinates of the elements of matter and
electricity. As indicated above we can however avoid the use of any such explicit
interpretation by the use of undetermined multipliers. In this way the variations of
E and B can be temporarily rendered independent of each other and of the
actual co-ordinates of the material and electrical elements.
