However, the breadth of the stream, may
probably be little more than go leagues ; for we crossed it, as
has been said, very obliquely ; and perhaps, in the widest
part. The journal of the ATLAs East India ship, Captain Coorg,
in 1787, furnishes much clearer proofs, both of the. existence
of the current, and of the rate of its motion : for having time
keepers on board, Captain CoorEtR was frequently enabled to
note the difference between the true, and the supposed,
longitude; and it may be said, that this journal, by the means
it affords of ascertaining the current, is highly valuable ; as
containing some very important facts, and which might have
been entirely lost to the public, had not Captain Cooper
marked them, in the most pointed manner. I shall proceed to state, in abstract, the most important of
the facts recorded in the journal. The ATLAs sailed with a fair wind, and took her depar-
ture from the Isle of Wight, on the 23th of January, 1787 ;
and on the 27th had advanced zz leagues to the westward of
Ushant ; when a violent gale of wind began at south, and,


that often prevails to the Westward of Scilly. 19t

about 11 hours afterwards, changed suddenly- to the west-
ward. The gale continued through the four following days :
on the 28th, it was generally W by S, and WSW ; on the
29th, SW by W, or more southerly : and on the goth and
g18t, SSW, to SW by S.*

During this long interval, the ship was generally lying to;
and with her head to the NW.
