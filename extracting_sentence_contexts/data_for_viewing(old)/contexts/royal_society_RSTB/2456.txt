DENNSTADTIIN ©.

This sub-tribe was founded by Prantr,* and placed under the tribe Aspidiew,
to include the genera Dennstedtiu, Microlepia, Leptolepia, Saccoloma, and Hypo-
lepis. The most important of these genera are the two first, which were placed
apart in the ‘Synopsis Filicum’: Dennstedtia (as the § Patania) was included in
Dicksonia, while Microlepia was included as a section of Davallia. But evidently
systematists had reason to know how closely allied these two were, since the synonyms
: have been numerous. The fact is that Dennstedtia is not very nearly related to
Dicksonia ; the form of sorus is different, and the details of the sporangium ; these
characters should weigh more strongly than any similarity of habit. On the other
hand Microlepia while it resembles Dennstedtia in its sorus, differs in certain
essential points from Davallia. My own observations confirm by new facts the
soundness of PRANTL’s systematic method in founding the sub-tribe; and TI shall
show that the sub-tribe occupies a peculiarly interesting position, as a connecting
link between the basipetal type of sorus seen in the Dicksoniew, and that of the
Davallias.

Microlepia (= Davallia, § Microlepia).
The sorus has been examined in Microlepia spelunce (L.), Moore, hirta (KAULF),
Prest., strigosa (THuNB.), Prest., and platyphylla (Don), J. Lu. In all these it

shows in the main a basipetal succession. This is seen in M. spelunca, in fig. 126, in
which the two lips of the indusium appear with the characteristic inequality, the
