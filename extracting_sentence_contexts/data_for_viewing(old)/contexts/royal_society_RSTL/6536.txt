the subsequent figures, the less refrangible end of the spectrum is upon the left-hand
8ide of the Plate.

The great prolongation of the more refrangible portion of the spectrum beyond the
part visible to the unaided eye, led me to believe that the bisulphide was a material
which exerted but little absorbent action upon the chemical rays. Subsequent experi-
ments have, however, convinced me that this opinion was erroneous, and have rendered
it necessary to modify considerably the conclusions deduced from those experiments.

2. At the time that that paper was written, I believed that the photographic effects
produced by the electric spectra of all the metals furnished results in a great degree
smilar to each other, if not actually identical. This, it will be seen from subsequent
statements, is correct 80 far as the fact of the similarity in this portion of the spectra is
concerned, but is erroneous as regards the general conclusion deduced from it. During
the past winter I have renewed these experiments, substituting a quartz-train for glass
and bisulphide of carbon, and have chiefly used a fine quartz prism, kindly lent to me by
my friend Mr. Gas81or. The refracting-angle of this prism is about 60*; its faces are
about 2 inches long and 14 inch broad, and are s0 cut as to furnish a singly refracted
beam for the medium rays, by transmitting it along the axis of the crystal. It is well
known, from the experiments of Prof. Sroxes* and M, E. Becquessr, that quartz is remark-
able for its transparency to both fluorescent and phosphorogenic rays of high refrangibility.
