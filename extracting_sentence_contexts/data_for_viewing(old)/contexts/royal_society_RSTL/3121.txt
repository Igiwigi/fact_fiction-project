are employed, to bring out horizontal refractions on opposite sides of the obseryed
quantity. LAPLACE conjectured that an intermediate atmosphere which should par-
take of the nature of both, and should agree with obseryation in the horizontal re-
fraction, would approach nearly to the true atmosphere. It must be allowed that
these conditions, which may be verified by innumerable instances between the two
limits, are vaguely defined ; and in order to ascertain the real meaning of the author,
recourse must be had to the algebraic expressions. When this is done it will be found
that the atmosphere intended is one of which the density is the product of two terms,
one taken from an arithmetical, and the other from a geometrical progression ; the
effect of which combination is to introduce a supernumerary constant, by means of
which the horizontal refraction is made to agree with the true quantity. No one will
deny the merit and the ingenuity of LapLacr's procedure; but though very skilful,
and guided in some degree by fact, it is liable to all the uncertainty of other arbitrary
suppositions, as indeed the author allows. Dr. BrinkLEy has given the character of
the French table fairly when he says, that it is only a little less empirical than the
other tables. On divesting LapLace's hypothesis of vagueness in the language, and
expressing it in the unequivocal symbols of algebra, it does not appear to possess any
superiority over other 8upposed constitutions of the atmosphere in leading to a better
and less exceptionable theory ; at least the Mec. Celeste has been many years before
the public, during which time not a few geometers have laboured on the subject of
the refractions ; but no improvement originating in the speculations peculiar to La-
PLACE has occurred to any of them.

Having said 80 much on the theory of the French table, it may be proper to add a
word on its accuracy. If it be compared from 80? to 88? of zenith distance with Bgs-
