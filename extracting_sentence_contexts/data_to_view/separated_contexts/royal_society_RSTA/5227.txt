The warm liquid is quickly removed, und the ice-cold liquid substituted ; this
causes the mercury in the tonometer to fall, and its observer O, calls aloud the
divisions as it passes them ; when the tension is approached at which it is desired to
observe the extension, the ice-cold water is removed, so that the cooling proceeds
more slowly, and while O, is carefully watching and calling the readings, O, makes a
momentary completion of the electric circuit, which results in the sudden reappearance

of a bubble of definite length, which he reads off while observer O, notes the height
to which the mercury in the tonometer has again risen. It is not always possible in practice to prevent the liquid from letting go its hold
too soon, and it often happens that the bubble forms in one of the bulbs, and not in
the tube, where only its volume can be read off, but this fact need not prevent an
observation of the volume from being made, for, if the observer O, only heats the
platinum wire for an instant, the liquid below it, which has been clinging to it,
separates, owing to its weight, and at once a bubble of hot vapour is formed, which,
by its greater pressure, causes the bubble in the bulb, which also is at a lower level,

0 close up and vanish. Thus the bubble can be instantly transferred to the place
ewhere it can be measured. 8
