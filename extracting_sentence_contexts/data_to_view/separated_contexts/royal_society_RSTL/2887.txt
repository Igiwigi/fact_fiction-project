The insect then became excited, and the thermo-
meter was held near enough to touch the tips of its wings. The temperature of the
air in the phial immediately sunk to 72%5, being a diminution of 2'2. This observa-
tion was several times repeated with the same results, 80 that while confirming the
previous conclusion respecting the eyolution of heat, it 8hows also another interesting
