The ‘yellow’
and ‘blue’ mechanisms together alter the latter to full colour vision (see § 160, p. 663). (81) The evidence for four nervous mechanisms

The supposition that there are four separate mechanisms rests on the following facts:

(1) The different colours lose colour at different visual angles; red and blue-green at
small angles; yellow and blue at larger ones. (2) The visual angles at which yellow, green and blue-green lose colour is practically
independent of background brightness, whereas the visual angles at which violet, blue, red
and orange lose colour are affected by alterations of background brightness.
