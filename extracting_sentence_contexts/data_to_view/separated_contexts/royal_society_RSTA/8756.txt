Given T and dV, the value of the ordinate for any particular value of V is deter-
mined absolutely. I believe that the data exhibited in fig. 18 furnish strong evidence that the distribu-
tion of energy among the chemically emitted electrons is of a very simple character
and is identical with that which would be possessed by the molecules of a gas at a certain
definite temperature. The fraction where kinetic energy lies between uw and u + du
appears, in fact, to be given by

For COCI, acting on NaK, the value of T appears to be close to 3600° K. The evidence
would, of course, be stronger if it were unequivocally supported by the analysis of
figs. 4 and 7. It may be that too much emphasis is being laid on the uncertain data
and the disturbing causes which affect curves I. and II. of fig. 17.
