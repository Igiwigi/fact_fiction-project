The data are for solid K, Na, KCl and NaCl, for carbon in the form of diamond, and
for gaseous Cl,, O,, CO and COCI,, in each case per gramme molecule, with the equations
as written. It is difficult to conceive of any way in which the average energy of the
electrons could exceed the equivalent of the heat of formation of two molecules of KCl
from two molecules of K and one of Cl, ; in fact, it is practically certain to be much
less than this. In general, if H is the heat available in gm. cals. per gramme molecule
we shall have as a limit for T

=H

where & is BourzMANN’s constant 1-346 % 107", J is the mechanical equivalent of
heat 4-184 x 10’, and N is the number of molecules per gramme molecule 6-2 x 10%.
If we put H = 208-1 x 10° this gives as a limit for T the value 69-7 < 10°. This is
about 14 times the value deduced from the experiments. However, something has
to be subtracted from the value of H for the unknown heat of formation of the liquid
alloy from the solid constituents, and the assumption that the whole heat of the reaction
is passed on to one electron is only worthy of consideration for the purpose of fixing a
