by the black dashed line highlights the area where the highest sea surface pCO, was observed during the Vendée
Globe race.

a pCO, oversaturation signal and a sharp increase from around 380 j,atm to > 410 patm. Zooming
into the high pCOz region in figure 6, the increase in the pCO, co-locates with the ship entering
the interfrontal zones, approaching the subantarctic front. Interestingly, this region is not co-
located with the largest change in the air-sea CO) flux (figure 5), likely linked to the fact that it is
among the best observed regions in the Southern Ocean [44,45]. However, as the neural network-
based mapping informs the global ocean within similar biogeochemical regions, the information
south of the Northern Boundary front will inform other, less well-observed regions south of
this front.

Recently, many studies have argued for an integrated observing system that consists of many
different components [20,21], i.e. ships, Saildrones, Argo floats and moorings to optimally sample
the Southern Ocean. Each of these observing platforms has its own strengths and weaknesses,
and so a combination of these platforms can draw on the strengths of each. Sailboats have the
potential to contribute to such an idealized observing network and support the other observing
components. While sailboat races predominantly occur in the respective hemispheric summer
season, they will not be able to resolve the present day discrepancy between ship-based and float-
