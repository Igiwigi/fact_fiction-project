ed prosenchymatous cells, surrounded by vessels or ducts, the orifices of which form
- d of ring at the point where the central axis joins the cellular rind. This struc-
© ure prevails in all the Monocotyledonous roots I have examined *,
In Dicotyledons, on the contrary, the woody substance of the root, like that of the
© tem, always has the vyascular elements in the central region and the woody tissue out-
* ide it; in fact the root of a Dicotyledon corresponds essentially with the stem, omitting
© he central pith and the liber-structure of the bark. In Victoria the cross section of a
 oot (Plate XXXIT. fig. 53) shows that the centre is occupied by the vascular structure,
© he large open ends of the vessels appearing scattered in a central cylindrical region,
- which is bounded externally by a circle of compact, small-celled cellular tissue, which
ay be compared with the woody portions of the vascular bundles of ordinary Dicoty-
Sons. Perpendicular sections made through the region where the roots pass out from
Hestem, show that the bundles of vascular tissue destined for the root become collected
-Sgether into a solid cord before entering it, and they then occupy its axis; while simi-
Sr sections of the origin of Monocotyledonous roots show that a hollow cylinder of
cular tissue arises from the * fibrous layer” of the stem and passes out in this cylin-
Bie form, its centre being occupied by tissne passing gradually from parenchymatous
- to prosenchymatous, but directly continuous with the central region of the stem. The
