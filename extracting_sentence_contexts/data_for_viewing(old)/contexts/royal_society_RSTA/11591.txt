substance, so that it might cool without sensible entrance of heat, recourse was had
to a modification of Kunnr’s process, whereby the velocity of sound in the liquid
or gas is ascertained. The material for research, pure ether, was prepared and dried
as already described in a paper by Dr. Youne and one of the authors (‘ Phil. Trans.,’
A, 1887, p. 57, et seq.). It had a constant boiling-point, identical with that already
given.

The experiments were carried out by Epcar Perman and Wituiam Ramsay
during the Session 1891-1892. Various attempts were made to deduce from the
results, by a graphical method, the true position of the curves representing the
adiabatic expansion of the gaseous ether, but with small success. At a later date,
J. Ross-INNeEs examined the figures contained in the tables annexed, and making
use of the fact that, without serious error, the isochoric lines, as in the case of
isothermal expansion, may be regarded as straight, contributed the mathematical
treatment given in Section 5.

For want of sufficient knowledge of the thermal data for liquid ether, a similar
treatment has not been found possible ; but it is the opinion of the authors that the
experimental data should be published, inasmuch as they may be found in future to
afford a means of determining the adiabatic relations of a liquid, of which the
behaviour in the state of gas is now obvious.

I. Apparatus EMPLOYED.

The pressure apparatus, A, was the same as that employed in the former research,
