fact that social interactions are often inherently heterogeneous
across individuals, owing to societies being composed of differ-
ent age or task groups, can lead to ‘organizational immunity’
({12-14], reviewed in [15]). Organizational immunity provides
prophylactic protection to particularly valuable group mem-
bers, such as the offspring or reproductive individuals, by
means of reduced exposure risk. Additional modulation of
these social interaction networks upon pathogen exposure
can further strengthen this effect [2,12,15-18].
