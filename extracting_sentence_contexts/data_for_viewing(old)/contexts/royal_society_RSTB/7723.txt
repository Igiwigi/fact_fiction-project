at Harpenden in 1940, which continued on every fine day for several weeks during which
the wind blew from almost every quarter, Williams (1942) remarks that ‘the only noticeable
effect (of the wind) was that when it was strong a few butterflies seemed to be carried away
with it against their inclination and usually high in the air’ (my italics—J. S. K.):

“Nearly all butterflies when on migration tend to fly at the height which is normal for
non-migratory flight, most individuals are below 10 feet, and few more than 20 feet above
the ground, or above the tree tops if over forest land’ (Williams 1949, p. 74).

Williams (ibid.) goes on to quote striking examples of the way butterflies regulate their
height, moving up and down at a constant height over an uneven substrate.

The fact that butterflies keep closer control over their own displacement than do locusts,
does not exclude the possibility of their migrations being directed in the long run by the wind.
If closer control over their own displacement means less dependence of course and track
upon the immediate wind, it also means there will be more chance of any given course, once
set by an orientation reaction to the wind, or to any other agency, at a critical time such as at
the start of migration in the morning, being maintained for hours afterwards when the
migrants have ceased to orient to that agency (cp. p. 270). And the fact that butterflies
have been seen flying equally often with and against the wind does not mean that they
cover equal distances with and against the wind, i.e. that the two orientations are equally
important in long-range migration. An example of short-range wind rectification, in
Monarchs (Danaus plexippus L.), has been quoted on pp. 267-269. A more generally
interesting example of wind rectification has been recorded for the Silver-Y moth, Plusia
gamma L., in Denmark (Larsen 1949). The species sometimes migrates by day, when its
