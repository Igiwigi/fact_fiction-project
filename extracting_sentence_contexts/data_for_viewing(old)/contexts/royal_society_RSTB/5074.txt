0Â°3 mm. above the level of the dorsal crest of the pars superior, and exactly dorsal
to the junction of the middle and posterior thirds of this structure.

Examination of transverse sections of this region of the otocyst shows that the
ventral third of the ductus opens throughout nearly the whole of its length into the
lumina of the partes superior and inferior by means of a vertically elongated aperture
in the medial wall of the otocyst, the ventral boundary of the aperture being situated
just below the groove which separates the pars inferior from the pars superior.

The extreme- ventral portion of this aperture places the lumen of the ductus
endolymphaticus in communication with that of the pars inferior, while by the
remainder of the aperture the ductus communicates with the pars superior. These
facts are not revealed, however, by an inspection of the exterior of the otocyst, from
which it would on the other hand rather be inferred that during some phase of
development subsequent to Stage N the lower extremity of the ductus endo-
lymphaticus has undergone displacement in a ventral direction so that instead of
opening, as it formerly had done, into the pars superior it now opens into the pars
inferior. While it appears, therefore, that the junction of the ductus endolymphaticus
with the pars inferior (developing sacculus) has assumed a position identical with
that which it occupies in the adult structure this is not really the case. The
apparently considerable ventral displacement of the terminal aperture of the proximal
portion of the ductus endolymphaticus is probably mainly to be attributed to extensive
growth upwards and outwards of the dorsal region of the pars superior. It is possible
