The
vapour bubbles represent the water vapour in equilibrium with liquid water at room temperature

and, as such, are essentially a poor vacuum with a calculated pressure of about 0.03 bar. No gases, : =
such as COz, No or CHg, were detected during Raman analysis of the inclusions, and because the : S
detection limits for these gases are generally in the range of a mole per cent in fluid inclusions, if : 2
these gases are present, their concentrations are low. 14

Why were fluid inclusions not found in meteorites before 1999, especially in meteorites where _
the activity of liquid water was evident? In fact, over the years, there have been scattered reports : Ss
of fluid inclusions in meteorites [33,34]. One of the more widely known studies of fluid inclusions : S
in meteorites, and the one that led to reports of fluid inclusions in meteorites being viewed with :&
scepticism for many years, was that of Warner et al. [34]. In that study, the authors reported : &

the presence of two-phase, liquidâ€”vapour inclusions in silicate minerals in diogenite ALHA
77256, and some lunar rocks.
