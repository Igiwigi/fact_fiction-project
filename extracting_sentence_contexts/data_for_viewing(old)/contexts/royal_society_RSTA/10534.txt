2 § 41. General mention has already been made in § 2, and incidently in other parts
Bot the paper, of relations between magnetic phenomena and sun-spot frequency, and
Sbthe numerical results obtained by Woir and Wourer for sun-spot frequency have
2 been already recorded in Table I. There are other methods of estimating solar
8 disturbance, and it would be of interest to consider likewise data based on these, and
ae investigate the question as to apparent variations in magnetic phenomena with
3 variation in the position of the spotted areas in the sun's surface. T have thought it
2 better, however, to confine myself wholly on the present occasion to WoLF and
S Worrer’s numbers, and to cover a limited portion of the ground in a comparatively
thorough way, rather than to wander at large over the whole field. My own opinion
His that the true inter-relationships of the several phenomena are hardly likely to be
g reached, and they certainly cannot be demonstrated, without a really minute and
& careful study of the facts.

3 In treating of sun-spot relations, I shall not adhere strictly to the order followed in
& the first part of the paper, but shall take first the case of the diurnal periodic changes.

§ 42. It has been established, largely through the work of Batrour Srewarr and
A Eis, that there is a close connection between epochs of maximum and minimum in
sun-spot frequency and in amplitude of diurnal inequality of magnetic elements. In
investigating this matter, Mr. Exxis eliminated the annual variation in the amplitude
of magnetic ranges by assigning to any individual month the mean amplitude
deduced from twelve consecutive months, of which it was the central month. I have
pursued a different method. This consists in expressing the range for any given
month as a percentage of the arithmetic mean of the ranges for this particular month
