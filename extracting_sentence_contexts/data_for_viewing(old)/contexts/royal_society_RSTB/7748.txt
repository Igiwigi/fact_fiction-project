This section reveals clearly that the deposits of No. 4 terrace are composite, bed 2 being
separated by an important time-break from the lower parts of the succession. In addition
to the marked change in pebble size seen at the junction of beds 2 and 3 and the channelled
base of 2 (facts not necessarily of great significance), there are two other facts which
are more obviously indicative of a time-break. There is a great change in the nature
of the constituent pebbles, flint being rare below bed 2 but dominant within it; and
bed 3 is ‘cryoturbate’, the bedding being warped into strong solifluxion festoons, whereas
bed 2 is quite unaffected. It can safely be said that a period of cold periglacial climate
occurred some time after the deposition of beds 10 to 3, and before bed 2.

The composite nature of No. 4 terrace is hinted at by some of the sections in the lower
Avon and Warwickshire Stour described by Tomlinson (1925, particularly the Ailstone
