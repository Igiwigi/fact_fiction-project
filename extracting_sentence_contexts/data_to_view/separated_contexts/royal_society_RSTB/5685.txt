This flow is much aug-
mented by their drainage (from water-surfaces well above country-level) (fig. 9) from the
time when they are filled (as soon as the flood is sufficiently high), until well on into the
following spring. The importance of this general effect is best shown in 1913 (fig. 14, p. 351), when
the behaviour of “ Well A,” the equivalent of Pit III at that time, is clearly quite
unrelated to that of the river during October

The general relation between the river and the free water-table of our farm is demon-
strated in fig. 24, p. 356, as an eight-year mean for Roda Gauge and for Pit III. The
interesting portion for the latter during January is imperfect, as it was not until 1930
that the pit was deepened sufficiently to show water all the year round ; the first
complete record is available in fig. 23, for 1931.
