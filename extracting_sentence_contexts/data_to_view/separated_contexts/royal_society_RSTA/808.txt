8 and 9, In using these curves we
have to remember to add on the value of 20 log,,[ /(| 7 |) ] appropriate to the wave-length
and conditions we are considering, and to help in doing this the values to be added on
in this way are tabulated on the graph. In computing these curves p was assumed equal
to p, in all cases, but account was taken of the fact that it is not really justifiable to
assume that 2odc is >e, e.g. for A= 2m. and ¢ = 1073, ¢ = 5 and ode — 1-2. The
