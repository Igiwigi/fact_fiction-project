of such plasma conditions in the high chromosphere cannot be ruled out. Moreover, it has
been suggested that ALMA observations may also have some (small) contributions from coronal
heights [66].

Although gravity waves have been suggested to not reach high chromospheric heights (i.e.
they are reflected back to the lower atmospheric levels by the magnetic canopy as slow magneto-
acoustic waves [107]), the dominant low frequencies of 1-2mHz that we find here could also
perfectly align with such waves that were previously observed in the lower chromosphere [39].
We cannot, however, verify here the nature of the waves represented by the low-frequency ALMA
oscillations.

Considering that all chromospheric diagnostics (except Ha intensity) show very pronounced
3-min oscillations dominating the dynamics of the chromosphere, the fact that only a very small
fraction of all the pixels in the ten datasets analysed here show peak power near 5.5 mHz may
be considered a surprise, in particular since 1-D simulations predicted a very strong, highly
nonlinear response in mm temperature brightness to the 3-min oscillations [68,71]. Why do the
1-D hydrodynamic simulations work remarkably well in reproducing other diagnostics such as,
e.g. the temporal evolution of the Ca II H and K line profile [3], but seem to completely fail in
reproducing the mm response to these oscillations? Magnetic fields are certainly an important
factor, but they should be a similarly important factor for other diagnostics. We should note that
the 3â€”5 min fluctuations have previously been reported in mm observations (at 85 GHz) from the
10-element Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Array [108] (with spatial resolution of ~10 arcsec), and
from observations with ALMA Band 3 [109]. In both studies, the authors applied a high-pass
filter to the data by subtracting a third-order polynomial fit from the time series. For short time
