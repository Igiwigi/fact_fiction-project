secondly, those thab are characteristic of partionlar genera or species.

Although only demonstrated in oue particular imstance (the youug of “lminrus
catus) by Ramsay Wrice, our researclies lead us to believe that the great majority
of Siluroids agree with Aminvus in haymg the centrum of the second vertebra, and
the centra, neural arches, and spinous processes of the third and fourth vertebrae
indistinguishably combined ta form an apparently single wertebra, for which we have
ventured to suggest the name of “complex vertebra.” The discovery by Bawpetor
that the “complex vertebra’ of the Cyprinidss was formed hy the fusion of the
second vertebral centrum with the third vertebra, was due to the distinctness of
these elements in one particular species, but no evidence of a similar natnre is
available in any but embryonic Siluride. Tn no adult Siluroid is there the slightest
trace of intervertebral spaces or sutures between the three confluent centra; in fact,
the only features which in any way suggest the composite nature of the complex
vertebra in that faroily are the perforation of ifs neural arch by two pairs of spinal
nerves and the oceasional presence of two pairs of nutrient foramina on the yentral
surface of its eentrum, Nevertheless the constaney of its characters in nearly all
Siluride: and the suppression of all trace of the second vertebral centrum as a distinct
element, justifies the conclusion that the complex vertelira has the same value as in
Amiurus, This fusion of vertebre in the formation of the “complex” is almost
invariably attended by the partial anehylosis of the latter to the fifth vertebra,
partly as the result of the firm sntural union of their correlated elements and in
patt due to the investment of the lateral surtsces of their centra by a continuous
deposit of superficial bone, Moreover, the conjoined yertebre, with the addition of
the centrum of the first, are so urticulated to the skull that little, if any, notion is
