posterior portions of the opening and septum enter into the formation of the anterior
half of the apicial orifice (Plate XII, fig. 11, 7), and become continuous with the posterior
fibres of the sixth layer (Plate XII. fig. 6, 00'). I use the term apicial orifice, because
the apex is opened into when the two sets of fibres which constitute the first layer

#* The apex in the ventricle of eyen the horse does not exceed the eighth of an inch in thickness. This
deficiency in the thickness of the ventricular wall, which, during the dilatation of the organ and the first stage
of contraction, ensures great freedom of motion, is prevented from operating injuriously during the latter stages
of contraction, by such portions of the musculi papillares as are situated at the apex plaiting into each other 80
as entirely to obliterate the apicial cavity.

+ It is a great mistake to imagine that all the fibres of the ventricles arise from the auriculo-yentricular
tendinous rings, the fact being that, with the exception of the fibres of the first and 8eventh layers, they are con-
tinuous beneath them. These rings are more fully deyeloped anteriorly than posteriorly, and the ring which
belongs to the left ventricle is stronger than that which belongs to the right.

(Plate XIL. fig. 11, fg), are removed. The fibres of the second layer are similarly
arranged at the apex to those of the first; 4. e. they converge slightly and curve upon
each other prior to doubling upon themselyes to alter their direction and enter the
interior. The fibres of the second layer differ from those of the first in being more
fascicular, and in issuing from the auriculo-yentricular orifice and entering the apex
more obliquely, the effect of which is to render their direction on the body of the
