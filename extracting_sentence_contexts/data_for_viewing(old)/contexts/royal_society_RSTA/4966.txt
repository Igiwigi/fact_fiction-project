(b) What causes the anisotropic cascade in turbulent plasmas?

The anisotropic nature of the nonlinear energy transfer in Alfvénic plasma turbulence has long
been recognized in laboratory plasmas [62-64] and in the solar wind [22], as well as in the
results of numerical simulations [65,66]. It is observed that energy is preferentially transferred
to small scales perpendicular to the local magnetic field direction, leading to anisotropic, small-
scale turbulent fluctuations that are elongated along the local magnetic field, characterized by the
wavevector anisotropy ky <k_.

Why is magnetized plasma turbulence anisotropic? This question can be answered rather
simply, in the context of incompressible MHD, through physical intuition derived from the
picture of nonlinear energy transfer presented above. Basically, the anisotropy arises as a direct
consequence of two facts: (i) only counter-propagating Alfvén waves interact nonlinearly and
(ii) the nonlinear energy transfer is maximized for interactions between perpendicularly polarized
Alfvén waves.

Consider the nonlinear interaction between two plane Alfvén waves with arbitrary
wavevectors kj and kz. We adopt the convention that the wave frequency must be non-negative,
w= 0, so that the propagation direction of the wave along the mean magnetic field is given by
the sign of the parallel component of the wavevector. The nonlinear interaction between these
two modes is non-zero only for counter-propagating Alfvén waves [17,48,49], so the parallel
components kj; and kj2 must be opposite in sign. A mode kg receiving energy via the nonlinear
interaction between these two modes must satisfy k3 = k; + kg, so its parallel component must
have ky3 < ky, and ky3 < ky. The nonlinear term in (2.1) has the form z* - Vz*. The magnitude
of this nonlinear term is maximized when the perpendicular components of the wavevectors of
