reduce climate change. tions from climate models are considerably less consistent


between global climate models, or robust at regional or smaller
scales [43]. This is even more of a challenge for likely, but more
complex, interactions such as the effect of climate change on
land-use, irrigation or water-storage practices, and in turn,
on vector-borne disease.

Third, they are also subjected to the limitations of com-
pounding uncertainties in the various stages of the modelling
process, and of the fact that the realized outcome in terms of
disease burdens is contingent on decisions over several dec-
ades, affecting components throughout the causal chain,
from emissions of greenhouse gases, to rates and patterns of
economic growth, to the development and deployment of
control interventions [7,42].

Further development of approaches to scenario analysis
would therefore help to make them more relevant to national
level disease control decisions. This would require more explicit
definition of the kinds of control decisions that may be informed
by climate scenarios, and their associated timescales (e.g. weeks
or months for the deployment of health personnel, years or dec-
