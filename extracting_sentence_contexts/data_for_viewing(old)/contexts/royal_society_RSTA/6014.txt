We start by introducing some notation.

In the following, we write A < B if an inequality A < CB holds for some constant C > 0 that
is independent of t and ¢. We furthermore write A ~ B if both A < B and B <A hold. This way,
for instance, the vortex intensities a; will be neglected in our analysis. In situations in which we
choose to explicitly introduce a constant C, this constant will always be independent of t and «,
and its value may change from line to line.

We shall also introduce 2;(t) as the support of the ith vortex at time t, that is, Q2;(t) = spt;(t).
With this notation, for any 14j, it holds that dist(:2;(0), 2;(0)) = 6, see (2.4). In our main results,
we claim that there exists a time T that is independent of ¢ up to which solutions to the Euler
equations are close to those of the point vortex system. Here, we make this choice more precise. In
fact, we choose T as the time at which the distance between the vortex components has decreased
by a factor of two

6,
T=sup f € (0, +00) : dist(2;(s), 2;(s)) = a ViA], $< i . (3.1)
Because the fluid velocity u is continuous, it is clear that the vortex components cannot collide
instantaneously, thus, T > 0. We will see later that this time is bounded from below uniformly in
e, that is, T 21.

Without loss of generality, we may restrict our attention to time intervals such that
