This result was anticipated due to the fact that the packing is at near-crystalline density,
which leaves little room for randomness in the configuration. Theoretical works done by
experimentalists, such as [11,16,44], assume this configuration without remark. In fact, in
theorem 5.7, we will demonstrate that even with weaker boundary information, as long as it
is satisfied by n = eg, the solution g = 0 will have lower energy than a non-constant minimizer 9”,
such that gj =0, when each is paired with a fixed free boundary p* that corresponds with g”*. Theorem 5.7. The function ¢ =0 is the unique minimizer in Af for a given boundary function p*.
