it is only one third the size of the sterno-mastoid ; in Pteropus it is even less, and its
upper third is tendinous, and inserted into the tip of the paroccipital. No trace of a
cleido-occipital exists in any of the species examined.

Sterno-hyoid (Plate XIII. fig. 8, 7) is broad, flat, and thin, passing from the posterior
aspect of the sternum to the os hyoides. In my specimen of Noctuling it was united to
the omo-hyoid in a manner to be described hereafter. A. tendinous inscription exists in
most of the Vespertilionine Bats; I found none either in the Pteropine or Phyllosto-
mous 8pecies, while in Rhinolophus the sterno-hyoid is narrow, and presents nothing
remarkable. In Noctulina the mylo-hyoid was covered by a layer of longitudinal
fibres, constituting a mento-hyoidean muscle. Of the other laryngeal and tongue-muscles

there are no facts of sufficient interest to deserve special record. The styloid muscles
are large and strong, especially the stylo-glossus, which passes as usual from the stylo-
hyal bone to the side of the base of the tongue.

Digastrie (Plate XIII. fig. 8, c, 4) in the Vespertilionine Bats is a simple one-bellied
depressor of the mandible, extending to the middle third of the ramus, and largest pro-
