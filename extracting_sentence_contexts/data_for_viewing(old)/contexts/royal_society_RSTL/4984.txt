of distinction, may be seen by referring to the sixth spore from the top in the ascus,
Plate XXVI. fig. 25, where the cell is divided by a longitudinal septum. Besides this
variety in the sporidia, which establishes at least a capacity if not a tendency to change
of form in the fructification, I have found perithecia in the same stroma producing the
very dissimilar bodies shown in fig. 28, a, 6, c, d, of which @ and þ do not differ from
the ordinary form of sporidium of Spheria lanciformis, and & and d are exactly the
fruit of Zendersonia polyeystis minus the gelatinous border. The absence of the latter
is easily accounted for, since all sporidia which have gelatinous envelopes lose them in
process of time, and the specimens in which these different forms were found were
unfortunately s0 far past their prime that the perithecia were almost empty. This latter
cireumstance may perhaps be considered as throwing some doubt upon the observation,
and it certainly would have been more satisfactory to have found the Spheeria and
Hendersonia in full fruit in the same stroma ; but if the facts T have stated be not con-
sidered sufficient to establish the identity of the two plants, they must, T think, be
admitted to afford reasonable grounds for a suspicion of relationship between them.

Tf the Hendersonia be an imperfect form of the Sphzeria, then the 80-called perithecia
and fruit of the former will be (to adopt M. TuLasxE's terminology) the pycnidia and
stylospores of the Sphzeria. In the last vol. of the * Annales des Sciences,” M. TuLasxEk
has described what he considers to be the conidioid form of fruit of Sphoria lanciformis,
and which from his description (there being no figures) I take to be a species of Cory-
neum, which occurs in the neighbourhood of London upon dead branches of Birch.

perhaps the most beautiful of all the British species in regard to fructification, was first
