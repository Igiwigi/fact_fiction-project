AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MYRIAPODA. 105

condition. They have always exhibited the same yellow colour, with only a slight
difference of opacity. At a later stage of development the whole appear to be in-
closed in a distinet membrane, the membrana vitelli (fig. 11.d), and even at this
early period (fig. 8.) the membrane may be regarded as in the course of formation,
as seems to be indicated by the fact, that the cells always cohere together when the
specimen has been placed in Spirits of wine, and afterwards allowed to remain for
some time in water. In these cases the ovisac becomes distended by the imbibition
of fluid, as is proved by the existence of a clear transparent space between the interior
of the ovisac (figs. 7 to 11.4) and the yelk (e), the cells of which do not separate, but
together retain the form of a single mass unaltered, even when pressed in different
directions between plates of talc beneath the microscope. When the ova are a little
further advanced (fig. 9.), the same yellow-coloured graniform cells compose the
yelks; but they are a little darker in colour, larger, and more distinctly exhibit a
granular structure in their interior: they closely resemble in form and structure the
vesicles of the yelk of the higher animals, as described in the excellent researches
of Dr. Marrin BarryÂ®*. The membrane of the yelk (d) at this period is more strongly
marked, and exhibits a distinct outline, when treated as above described ; and the
