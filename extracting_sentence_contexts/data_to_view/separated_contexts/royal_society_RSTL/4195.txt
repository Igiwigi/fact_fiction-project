In the
Specimen figured in Plate V. fig. 9, we see this to be the case only with the three zones
nearest the centre; in that represented in Plate V. fig. 10, the canal is single in the
Five inner zones; whilst in that represented in Plate V. fig. 7, the canal is single for
the first twenty-three zones, Whenever the annular canal is single, the upper and
lower superficial cells also become continuous, and form a series of columnar cells in
every respect similar to those of the simpler type (compare Plate V. fig. 5 with the
portion @—b of Plate V. fig. 7). If, then, the growth of either of these disks had been
checked within the first zone in which its annular canal becomes double, it would
have been accounted as belonging to the simpler type; and the wide variation which
here shows itself, in regard to the distance from the nucleus at which the more com-

58. Even when an intermediate stratum is formed by the separation of the annular
canals, the superficial cells are not always clearly marked-off from its columnar
cavities; for instead of being separated by floors formed by the expanded summits
of the zonal septa (© 28.), they sometimes open at once into the columnar cells of
the intermediate substance, 80 as to be quite continuous with them. Of this we
have an example in the three zones 6—8 of the specimen represented in Plate V.
