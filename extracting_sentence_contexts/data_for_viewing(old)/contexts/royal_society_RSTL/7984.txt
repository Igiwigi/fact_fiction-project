similar. As the great disturbance which might be supposed to occur from variations in
the compoxsition of the soil does not take place to any considerable extent under the con-
ditions of the experiment, it is difficult to perceive any canse that can obscure the con-
sequences of the hypothesis, supposing it to be'true, | But in order to test it still further,
the bases in the ash were sgparately determined in a few cases in which the divergence
was most marked, and the numbers obtained were compared with the amount of alka-

loid, but without at all diminishing the discrepancy, I am therefore compelled to believe
either that the hypothesis is not true, or else that it is only true to a yery partial extent ;
in fact 0 partially as to render it of no assistance in the scientific culture of cin-
chona.

In order to test the hypothesis in another manner, the s0il round some young trees of
C. $uccirubra, which was naturally singularly poor in lime, was made, by constant dres-
sing with well-exposed hydrate of lime, almost into a calcareous s0il. After two years
and a half the bark was analyzed and its ash determined. It yielded 6:23 per cent. of
total alkaloids and 2:91 per cent. of ash; in other words, the Presence of abundance of
a powerful base in the soil had affected neither the amounts of alkaloids nor of ash.

The crown barks offer a still further contradiction to the hypothesis. Trees growing
close together may have nearly the same amount of ash and yet contain organic bases in
nearly the proportion of 1 : 2.
