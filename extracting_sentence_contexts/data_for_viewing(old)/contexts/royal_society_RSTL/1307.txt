6. As albumen becomes visibly coagulated, by the effect
produced from twelve four inch double plates of copper and
iron, a power much too low to affect even the most delicate
electrometer, may not this be occasionally employed with ad-
vantage as a chemical test of electricity, whilst the production
of acid and alkali, affected by still inferior degrees of electricity
to those required for the coagulation of albumen may like-
wise be regarded as auxiliary tests on such occasions?

If these facts and observations appear to the Society to throw
any light upon the principle of secretion, it may be an advan-
tage to medical science, that they should be laid before the
publie, as hints for future inquiry.
