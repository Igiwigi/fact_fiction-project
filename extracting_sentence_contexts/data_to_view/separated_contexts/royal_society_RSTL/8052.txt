The distance [I. IT] was compared with the Pulkowa Kklafter eleven times between

May 7th and 11th at a temperature of about 53?, and nine times on June 10th and 11th

at about 58?.

'& The reduction of these observations by the method of least squares shows that, the

Frobable error of one comparison was

-5 We have now determined directly the lengths of the Pulkowa and Milan Kklafters, and

B80 by direct observations their difference. It remains to examine as to the consistency

E& these results ; they are, in fact, these :—

'S K' —2K, =162:44 +0:38,

= K!.,—2K, =139-64+0-56,

2 K — K!,,= 20:86 +0-43,

Which are not consistent, as the difference of the first and second exceeds the third by
94. If we adjust the three results by least squares, we get

= K' =2K,+162:01,

65 K!.,=2K,+140-59. But these results are not perfectly satisfactory, as from the manner in which they have
en derived we cannot express their probable errors.
