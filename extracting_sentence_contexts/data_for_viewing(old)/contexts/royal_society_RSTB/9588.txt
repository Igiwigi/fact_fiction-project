Without explicit attention to counterfactuals, measures of
threats as outcomes could misdirect conservation resources.
Maximizing outcomes for threats could focus new protected
areas on places where threats are most easily mitigated,
even if the value added by protection (impact) is small or
zero, while neglecting places where serious threats can only
be slowed, not stopped, but where the estimated difference
relative to places without protection (impact) is large.
