(2.64) (Ses Lee
or in covariant form,
(2.65) K, = Aydt,

where 2,, is the covariant derivative of 4,. Thus, since the vanishing of all the
components of x, is the characteristic of a geodesic, we have the result :

THeorEM II] :—In order that the curves of a congruence may be geodesics, it is necessary
and sufficient that

where 2° is the unit vector everywhere co-directional with the congruence.

It is important to note that from the mere fact that 4” is a unit vector we have

a

and therefore

(2.662) 2, a” = 0.

Now the orthogonal trajectories of the family of surfaces (2.61) are defined by the
equations
