sulphuric acid may perhaps be explained by assuming that an intermediate chlorimide
is formed through which the rupture of the molecule is facilitated—

The Hydrolysis of Cyanhydrins.—The constitutional formula we propose for lotusin
appeared to satisfactorily account for all its reactions with the exception of the
production of hydrocyanic acid by action of dilute hydrochloric acid, which required
further elucidation. For it is generally stated that cyanhydrins, whether derived
from aldehydes or ketones, furnish the corresponding acids when hydrolysed by
either acids or alkalies, except in the case of #-hydroxycyanides, which under the
influence of alkalies lose hydrocyanie acid with formation of an aldehyde. Thus
the pentacetyl cyanhydrin of arabinose when acted on with alcoholic potash furnishes
hydroeyanic acid and arabinose, It seems, however, that the pure cyanhydrins have
been isolated and their properties studied only in a very few cases.
