The bark of Plate V. fig. 27 obviously exhibits the innermost layer (4) in a contracted
or compressed condition, whilst the outer one (#) is of fully double the thickness of that
seen in the large stem, Plate IV. fig. 21. This enlargement corresponds with what we
have already $een in the transverse section of the nodal disk in Plate IIL. fig. 16, and
leaves no doubt on my mind but that the former is also a nodal section. There is no
doubt, therefore, that the Burntisland plants exhibited the same nodal expansion of the
bark that, we find in the Lancashire type. It will further be observed from Plate V.
fig. 27, g', that the inner and middle barks accompany the branch in its outward course, as
might haye been anticipated, supposing my interpretation of this structure to be
correct.

After combining the facts which T have enumerated, T have no doubt that these

® Tt is interesting to find that M., Rexavur has discovered solitary branches in some of his Autun gspecimens
occupying exactly this position, He says respecting them, ** Les rameaux que j'ai eu occasion de ene
encore adherents 4 la tige 6taient s0litaires 8ur leur articulation.” * Cenx que J'ai observ6s 6taient toujours

+ IL Rexavrr's discovery of the position and origin of the true foliar bundles already referred to (pp. 45 & 48)
leaves no room for doubting that these deflected laminw have been connected with a lateral branch, and not
merely with Teaves, since we have een that the exogenous lamine do not contribute to the formation of the
merely foliar bundles, —February 9, 1874,
