colour were prepared by the following admixtures :â€”ferric chloride with snlphocya-
nide of potassium in large excess ; sulphocyanide of potassium with ferric chloride in
large excess ; ferric nitrate with sulphocyanide of potassium ; the same salts with the
addition of a large quantity of sulphate of potash ; sulphocyanide of potassium with
ferric acetate; ferrous and ferric sulphocyanide with sulphocyanide of lead; and
nearly pure sesquisulphocyanide of iron. On repeated dilution with equal amounts
of water these all appeared to retain the same relative colour.

It seems then, as far as this experiment can prove it, that the action of water, what-
ever it be, is exerted equally upon red sulphocyanide of iron, with whatever other
snbstance it may be mixed. This removes any doubt that might have rested from
this canse on some of the original experiments with ferric sulphocyanide : and the
fact that those experiments were always comparative, leayes little ground for any
possible objection.

An experiment was likewise tried in order to determine whether the presence of

other s8ubstances had any influence in the dilution of meconate of iron. Solutions
were taken of pure ferric meconate ; and of mixtures of ferric chloride with meconic
acid ; of the same with meconate of potash, both in large excess and otherwise ; of
