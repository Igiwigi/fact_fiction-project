These numbers also give a curve. It is that designed in Plate VII. fig. 11.

It is not diflicult to bring this experiment into uniformity with the preceding $0 as
to form in fact a continuation of it, one equiy. of ferric nitrate being combined with
less than three equivs. of sulphocyanide of potassium. For, expressing the number
of equivalents of the iron salt by z, and the comparative amount of ferric sulphocy-
anide by y, the general formula of the terms in the above Table will be, K denoting
the potassium and F the iron salt,—

which may evidently be reduced to a unity of F by dividing by z, thus—
