introduced over the ‘free’ surface, having nodes at these NV angular values. We regard the

unknowns as

The number of unknowns is therefore 3N and we have exactly 3N equations from (8)
and (4) by particularizing the values of @ to 4), ..., 0y_;. At each stage of the motion, we have
calculated the N values Ro, R,, ..., Ry». To these values we fit a curve in even harmonics
of the form of the first V terms of the expansion (10). Knowing all the values at one time,
we proceed to the next step in time, using in our equations the particular values of [8R/60]
obtained from the curve fitting to R.

We have not, in fact, so far attempted a two-fluid problem, but we have carried through
the process described above for the case of a single fluid in vacuo. The number of simultaneous

equations to be solved in each step is 2N for the case of a single fluid, and we have used
N= 4and N= 5 inspecial examples.

Non-dimensional variables. In order to simplify the algebra, we use non-dimensional
variables. The first group of problems we shall consider relate to the collapse of fluid columns
initially of hemi-cylindrical shape, resting on the diametral section; or of hemispherical
shape resting on the diametral section. Let a be the initial radius in either case. Then we
