alteration of the normal current in a positive direction, 7.¢., in the same direction
as its exciting current; and (2) an alteration in a negative direction, 7.¢., in the
opposite direction to its exciting current. The first of these currents is physio-
logical and occurs only on the living eye, the second is physical and occurs with or
against the first on the living eye, and alone on the dead eye; it is the ordinary
counter-current of electrolytic polarisation.

Tetanisation by alternating makes and breaks is a particularly complicated case,
inasmuch as we have unequally exciting currents that elicit unequal polarisation
currents. Once outside the clear case of a large positive effect or after-effect caused
by both directions of tetanisation, matters become exceedingly complicated. We
shall find it necessary for further intelligence of the facts to study the effects of
single induction shocks and of single condenser discharges. We shall also do well to
avoid for the present further complication by considering the effects upon retinal
responses of other than the first stage.

For these reasons I shall at present limit myself to the statement that the normal
living eyeball during the first few hours after excision is predisposed towards the
manifestation of positive current when excited by tetanising currents of any direction.

With regard to the subsidiary question put at the outset of this paragraph, the
preliminary and qualitative answers are that the augmented positive response to
light is in chief part due to augmented electromotive force, in small part due to
diminution of resistance. As regards the negative response to light of the third
