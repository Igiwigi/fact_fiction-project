and movement behaviour [9-12], biologging can also gather information about

the abiotic environment experienced by the host (e.g. [11,13]). These data can

environmental variation and/or extremes, and potentially to predict how ani-
mals may respond to climate change (see Chmura et al. [14]). The diverse
plethora of data that can be gathered from a single device mean that biologging
studies are extremely information-rich, perhaps containing thousands of data
points for each measured variable (e.g. [15-17]). However, this high per-
device information content comes at a cost. Data analysis is complicated by
the fact that resulting datasets are often time series, where successive values
of our metrics of interests are dependent on values from prior sampling
events [18] (table 1). For example, the blood pO of a diving elephant seal at
time f during a dive is entirely dependent on pO; at time f — 1 because of a lim-
ited store of oxygen [34]; or, trends in body temperature over time may be non-
random because of circadian rhythms [35,36]. This distinction is important
because it changes some decisions we might make about how we conduct
our analyses. To glean some insight from our hard-won biologging data, not
only do we need to draw on the ‘standard’ statistical toolkit that physiologists
are expected to be familiar with, including general(ized) linear models, their
mixed model equivalents [37] and their potential pitfalls [38,39], but we also
need to equip ourselves with the skills necessary to deal with time series
[18,40]. Testing hypotheses about the processes driving variation in our data
