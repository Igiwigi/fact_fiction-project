The factor 7(&q) is a
sublattice-dependent staggering factor: it equals +1 (—1) if the frustrated unit &, occupies the
A (B) sublattice. It is therefore implicitly assumed that the frustrated units occupy a bipartite
lattice. In fact, only in this case is it known how to define the map to the B fields [3] giving the
Gauss law required above. The constraints, equation (2.2), can then be resolved by an emergent gauge field B' = V x A’. Furthermore, the spin correlations are recovered by the B’ fields if one imposes a magnetostatic
action for each of them as the simplest ansatz for a coarse-grained theory:

S= * [aexey. (2.3)

This is the prominent Coulomb phase [3,8] action.
