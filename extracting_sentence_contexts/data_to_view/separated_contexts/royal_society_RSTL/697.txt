when no explosions occurred, the powders remained sta-
tionary, and' gradually acquired a whitish colour from amal-
gamation. I tried to explode the powder by friction, and did not at
first $ucceed, but on well drying it, and warming the vessels
in which the experiment was. to be made, I was able to
explode'it, both in a Wedgwood and steel mortar. The effect
was feeble, and consisted merely of a few slight cracks.
