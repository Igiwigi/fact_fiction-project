The two modelled
polymers are polystyrene (PS) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). For these two materials
one shall consider the parameters reported in table 2, so as to describe viscosity according to the
CY model [37]: with the choice of a parameter equal to 1 — 1, the CY model is further simplified

and can be rewritten as follows:
Ho

=o 4.1
Mh Thape (4.1)

Before presenting any result, it is important to highlight how the physical quantities have to
be converted into lattice units. As stated before, in fact, LBM is based on a non-dimensional
approach, thus, viscosity and other physical parameters have to be converted into their respective
values into the LB framework. In order to do that, some conversion factors have to be specified. More specifically, according to SI units, one has to define length, time and mass conversion factors
which allow passing from the real to LB world and vice-versa.
