Displacement at any one
level is due to a combination of all three modes, but maximum displacement due to any
one mode is found at the appropriate interface. In a model which approximates to lake
conditions, the periods of the internal seiches will be very much longer than that of the
surface seiche. In fact, the smaller the density difference across the interface, the longer
will be the period of the mode associated with it. Displacement resulting from the surface
mode (no. 1) is usually small enough to be neglected, and the periods of the internal modes
(nos. 2 and 3) may be derived from equations (A15) and (A16) in the appendix and are

given by T0=2l],/(—gH®), (5)
