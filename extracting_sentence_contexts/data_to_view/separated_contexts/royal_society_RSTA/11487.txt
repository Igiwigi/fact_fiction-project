This hypothesis has, however, to face the
difficulty that there is no change of shape in the liquidus curve to correspond to the
existence of such a compound ; the liquidus, as determined in the present experiments
and in those of Roperrs-AusTEN already cited, shows no signs of either a maximum
or a break of continuity, while there is also no sign of any absorption of heat at any
temperature between the liquidus and the solidus which might account for the
formation of such a compound in that range of temperature. On this ground,
hypothesis (b) must also be rejected. The remaining explanation is the one which appears best to fit the facts. On this
view the solid solution of tin in lead, when it contains more than 8 per cent. of tin, is
capable of existing in two forms which may be called « and B respectively. The
saturated (8) form of this solution, containing 16 per cent. of tin (approximately),
passes into the « form on cooling to 149° C., and at that point rejects a certain
amount of the dissolved tin in a finely divided “secondary” state.
