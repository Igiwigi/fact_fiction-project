possible only for a restricted class of functions g(x). For example, we observe, by successive
differentiation of (1), that if k(x, y) satisfies a linear differential equation of the form

(Frat ale) fost. tpa(a) | Cas y) = 0
ayn tA F Ps a Pn x,y) = 9%,

then solutions of (1) exist only if g(x) satisfies the same differential equation. Thus for
kernels of this kind there is no well-behaved solution for arbitrary well-behaved functions
k(x,y) and g(x), and it is known theoretically that this is true for all regular kernels. Fred-
holm’s equation of the first kind is then almost always a singular integral equation, in the
sense of this paper.

The problem is further complicated by the fact that, given the necessary relation between

k and g, there may be an infinity of solutions. For a kernel of the form k(x, y) = Ps a,(x) b,(y),
1

for example, it is clear that no solution exists unless g(x) has the form
g(x) a p ¢,a,(%),
