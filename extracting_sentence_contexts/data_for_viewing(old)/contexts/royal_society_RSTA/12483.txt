found. ‘This value, as might be expected, is often found to differ by a small quantity
from the first determined value of the weight. The difference is generally negligible,
except in the case of hydrogen, where the total weight is small. In this case, as the
second determination of W is more reliable than the first, it is accepted. In the first
determination there is evidently some chance of the vessel contracting some impurity
upon its surface in the process of filling.

The thermal comparison of the spheres at normal pressures is now effected. I
have generally thought it inadvisable to increase the weight of gas dealt with by
exhausting the active sphere. In the process of exhaustion there was risk of spoiling
the weighings by contamination of the surface of the sphere. There was also the
risk of a back-leakage of air into the sphere during the process ; injurious, either by
the fact that it was undried or as an impurity if other gas was being dealt with.

The number of observations made on the thermal equilibrium of the “empty”
spheres is some five or six generally. In the earlier experiments these observations

were more frequent, as trifling alterations on the valve or for leakage, &c., were
then often necessitated.
