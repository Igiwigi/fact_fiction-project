We know from the foregoing investigation that @',, is given as the root of an
equation of degree 7, and that, if the roots of this equation are all different, no more
conditions than those just mentioned as satisfied are necessary to ensure the existence
of the subnormal solution. But in this case the equation for 6", is particularly easy
to construct. We have, in fact,

nx —O,, = 0, v=o =... =2,"=0,

nte—O,p° = 0, tee es en
3 i" 3 5

Nitg —O yyilo —P yp)” = O, oo =... = a= 10;

2-1 — P yglp— a” —Pygilgg” see = 0,
i 1 —s
-8 npl n-1— ++ +A “(p-y41 = 0,
from which at once we have

1
Thus, unless A™,(p-141 = 0, the values of 6',, are all different, and a solution in
subnormal form is therefore possible, as stated above, with the independent variable
changed to a",
If, however, A™y(p-1+1 = 0, we have . Pup = 0. = On = 0,

and it will be found that the same conditions are necessary between the constants
An(p—1)+1 as were found previously (p. 13) between the constants #, Aj 141
being the same as n. a,, e.g., from the equations

H - 2,
NC + AMA pry = 0, A y(p-nsi—72,” = 0,
we have
A* y-ray p-ner = 0, 46, o,** +00"? = 0, and so on,

Consider now what happens when these conditions are not all satisfied. Suppose,
for instance, «,*"+«,'"1+ 0, Let the original system be transformed by the change
of variables

e=2, k=n-1.
