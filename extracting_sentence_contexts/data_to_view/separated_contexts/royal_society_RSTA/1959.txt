Le Verrier sent the answer : o
on 28 June confirming that the error in the radius vector was accounted for, explaining the details 1
of his theory, but also asked ‘If I could hope that you will have enough confidence in my work : §
to seek this planet in the sky, I would hasten, Sir, to send the exact position to you, as soon as I : g

have obtained it’ [48]. Airy did not ask Le Verrier for a better prediction as he was able to see that
Le Verrier’s prediction was within a few degrees from that of Adams. Le Verrier’s estimate of the
error on the predicted location at that time was 10 degrees, but the fact that two people reached
essentially the same conclusion independently, using somewhat different data and differing in the
approach (see [49,50] for details on the mathematical approaches), convinced Airy that the search
should start as soon as possible (see also [51] about the precision of Le Verrier’s final prediction). The other part of the international scandal relates to the story of naming the planet. This is by
far the most illustrative and entertaining part of the story (see [52-54]), and Challis and Adams
can be blamed for inflaming it.
