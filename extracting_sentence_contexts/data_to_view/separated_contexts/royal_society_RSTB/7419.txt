exceedingly unlikely that all graft series have the same maximal concentration of these
cells. There is the possibility, however, that the characteristic infiltration: is determined
not by the host animal but by the graft tissue itself or partly by it. To test this hypothesis
two rabbits (130 and 132) were given their second set of grafts not from their original
donors, but from others—in fact, their donors for the second set were exchanged. The
resulting infiltration in these ‘false’ second-set grafts was clearly characteristic of the host
animal rather than of the tissue grafted (see figure 1).

(b) The concentration of mature plasma cells in the first-set grafts at 12 days are
positively correlated with the concentration of immature pyronin cells in the second-set
at 8 days (rg=0°7151, P=0-05).
