Diameters of the Earth, than thoſe made in Jamaica.
And the Lengths of the Paris and London Pendu-
lums compared together, would make it greater
than one 231 Part of the Whole, as it was found
in Article 5, d

lums, it appears that the Theory makes them longer

don Pendulum ſhould be longer when compared ro
the Paris one, than it really is: The Jamaica
Pendulum, when compared to the London one,
which vibrates in a greater Iſland, ſhould be Ionger
than is found by Experience ; and the Pendulum in
Cayenna (a ſmaller Iſland than Jamaica) ſhould
