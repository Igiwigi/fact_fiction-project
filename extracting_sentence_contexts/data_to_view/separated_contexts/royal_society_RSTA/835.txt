Let u,v € V". We will show that
(u,v) € E” if and only if either (i) ou) is an edge entering X and 9 (x) is an edge leaving X
or (ii) the edges gy MW) and gy 1(v) in G lie end to end with the destination node of gy la) being
the origin of gy, lv), We shall also prove the analogous statement but taking instead u,v € V° and
replacing ¢; with ¢ in the above. These two facts together imply g is an isomorphism. Suppose (u,v) € E", then certainly the edges Ly lu) and Ly1(v) in Ex lie end to end with the
destination s of Ly 1(u) equalling the origin of Ly! (v). We consider two cases.
