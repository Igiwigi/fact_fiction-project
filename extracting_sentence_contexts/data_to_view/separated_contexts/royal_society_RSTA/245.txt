Thus specified, f is calculable and contours of # will be members of a family w
includes the centre line and the wall of the nozzle. The conjugate function « can be dedu
(apart from a nugatory constant of integration) by the methods developed in Part V, a
its contours will cut the f-contours orthogonally. None of them (in general) will exac
coincide with AB, A’B’, because along those curves / will not accord exactly with the str
function of an incompressible fluid passing right through the nozzle; but in fact the
crepancy is small and such that no sensible inaccuracy need be suspected in the region
the ‘throat’. Any convenient value /, may be attached to / at the nozzle wall, and any convenient
number of contours may be mapped: in our net (figure 7) the contour values of # increase
from 0 to 105 by increments of 2 x 10*, and the same increments separate contour values of a, 3
A one-to-one correspondence obtains between points on the curvilinear net and points in
the a-f plane; points on the centre line of the nozzle (where # = 0) correspond with the axis _
of a, and points on the nozzle wall with the horizontal line (f = 10°). The curvilinear ‘field’ —
of figure 2a is transformed into the ruled rectangle of figure 26, and any physical quantity —
determined as a function of « and f in figure 24 can also be plotted as a function of x’ and
y’ in figure 2a.
