counterexamples in condensed matter physics, in particular superconductivity [16,19]. But these
were not well understood; there was considerable debate among the experts as to whether that
was really an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking, and it was generally believed that the
Nambu-Goldstone bosons were unavoidable in relativistic theories. This became known as the
Goldstone theorem.

Naturally, there was a lot of discussion of this issue among those trying to develop gauge
theories. When Steven Weinberg came to Imperial College on sabbatical in 1961/1962, he and
Salam spent a lot of time discussing this issue, and eventually developed what seemed like a
watertight proof, which they published together with Goldstone [20].

For the sake of those who want to know the details, let me summarize the argument. (Others
may skip this paragraph.) It relied on the well-known fact (called Noether’s theorem after its
discoverer, Emmy Noether) that a continuous symmetry is always associated with a conservation
law; for example, translational symmetry is associated with conservation of momentum. The
conservation law is expressed through a local continuity equation of the form

a
auf = +V-5=0, (65)
where f° =p is the density of the conserved quantity and j = ij P, P) the flux density. This
normally leads to a global conservation law
