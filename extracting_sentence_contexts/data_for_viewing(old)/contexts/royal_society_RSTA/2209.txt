functions on the upper-half plane with well-defined q-expansions and moreover have integral
coefficients. In fact, a lot more is true: up to a possible addition of a polynomial, the quantum
invariants Z, are linear combinations of false theta functions multiplied by a rational q-power (cf.
§2a and [18]).

A puzzle immediately arises given the simple result for weakly negative three-star graphs:
what happens when one flips the orientation of the three-manifold? While this might sound like
an innocuous operation, it can in fact have rather dramatic consequences due to the pseudo-chiral
symmetry (or CP symmetry in physical terms)

Zcs(M3;k) = Zcs(—M3; —k) (1.6)

of Chern-Simons theory. From the relation (1.4) between the quantum invariants Za (M3; 7) and
Zcs(M3;k), and in particular the relation ‘t > (1/k)’ between the two variables, one is led to the
guess

Za(—Mg; 7) ‘=’ Za(M3; —1)- (1.7)

There are a few immediate problems with this guess. Recall that for a weakly negative plumbed
manifold Mz, definition 1.1 defines a function Za (M3; 7) on the upper-half plane H, which is not
