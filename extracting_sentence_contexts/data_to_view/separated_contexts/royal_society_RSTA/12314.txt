H. DARWIN ON TIDAL PREDICTION. The slight superiority shown over the mechanical prediction must be attributed to
the fact that I have used better values of the tidal constants than were available in
1883, when the Indian predictions must have been made. T learn from Colonel Hitt that two independent observers reading the same tide-
curve will frequently differ by 5" and sometimes by 10" in their estimate of the time,
and by 1 and sometimes by 2 inches in the height. Accordingly, predictions which
agree with a reading of a tide-curve with probable errors of 64" in time and 1 inch in
height may claim to possess a high order of accuracy.
