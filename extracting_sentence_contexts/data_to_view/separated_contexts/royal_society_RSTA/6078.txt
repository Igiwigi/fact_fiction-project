There is no known string-theory cosmological compactification to any
FLRW universe with late-time accelerated expansion, but one may still ask whether the premises
of the de Sitter no-go theorems exclude it. They do not exclude it, but they do impose the bound
w > —4, which is not compatible with observations. One remaining possibility exploits the fact that transient de Sitter-like acceleration is generic for
any compactification that leads to an effective four-dimensional theory with a positive potential
V. This is easily achieved; the no-go theorems require only that V has no stationary point for
V > 0, and the de Sitter swampland conjecture imposes bounds on the magnitude of the gradient
of V. Cosmological evolution involves rolling up the potential to a maximum value, and then a
rolling down; this implies a moment at which the total energy density € is stationary and this
drives a transient phase of de Sitter-like expansion.
