and it is readily seen to violate the equality (Vj W2) = (V2W)) (p < 10-7, x? test with d.f.=1). At
the same time, the diagram yields AC = —0.422, no evidence of contextuality. This example serves
as a good demonstration for the fact that while the QQ equality is a sufficient condition for lack
of contextuality, it is by no means necessary. Considering the question pairs one by one, all but six AC values out of 73 are negative. In
five of these six cases, the QQ equality |(V,;W2) — (V2W;)| =0 cannot be rejected with p-values
ranging from 0.06 to 0.47.
