It was found that if more
than a critical quantity of grains was present no visible nucleation occurred. The overflow
remained quite clear. The critical quantity depended on the grain size and over the range
examined was in fact connected with seed diameter by a relation which was practically
linear (table 1). TABLE 1. AMOUNTS OF SEED GRAINS REQUIRED TO PREVENT FRESH NUCLEATION
