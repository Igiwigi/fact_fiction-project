From the spectra, we can see that, after the removal of the outliers, the spectrum of
the cleansed data generally follows the Kolmogorov spectral line up to near 10 Hz before finally
levelling off. Ideally, the higher the frequency, the more isotropic the turbulence should be. The
levelling off, however, indicated otherwise; the higher-frequency turbulence seen here actually
approaches white noise, a fact that can only be explained by the insufficient accuracy of the ADV
instrument used in this experiment. The overall spectral shape is similar to those obtained either
in the laboratory [18] or in the field [20], all showing a prominent peak of the surface wave, near
0.2 Hz in this case, and a long tail. Of note here is that the spectral tail, covering nearly two
decades in frequency, indicates that the large-scale waves in the open ocean data indeed offer, for
the first time, a possibility to have a scale separation between waves and turbulence.
