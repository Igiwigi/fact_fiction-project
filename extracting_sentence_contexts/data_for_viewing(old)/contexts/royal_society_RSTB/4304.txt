than at the minute investigation of any one disease for a long series of years.

A complete examination of the statistics of one disease was, therefore, greatly to
be desired. This was further necessary as possibly affording a means of distin-
guishing between rival theories of epidemics.

Such an investigation with regard to measles in the City of London has now been
carried out. For this example there is quite an exceptional amount of evidence.
The London Weekly Bills of Mortality preserved in the libraries of the Guildhall and
the British Museum contain information which gives, among other details, the
number of deaths from measles for every week from the year 1703 to the year 1838,
except for an unfortunate break of 12 months in the years 1829-30. From 1838 the
publications of the Registrar-General give the same information. The fact that the
data refer to deaths alone and not to the cases must be regarded as a subsidiary
drawback, since, on comparison, the statistics of cases and deaths where the informa-
tion for both is available (e.g. Aberdeen, 1880â€”1900) show a very close correspondence.
It is not, of course, in the least contended that for the eighteenth century the data
are nearly as accurate as those available since the introduction of registration, but
for the purpose of this investigation the relative accuracy of figures for considerable
periods of time is nearly as important. Were this relative accuracy even approached,
the figures of the eighteenth century would have been of extreme value. But as will
be seen later, though some conclusions may be definitely arrived at, still the figures

cannot unfortunately be taken as representing any uniform system of record.
