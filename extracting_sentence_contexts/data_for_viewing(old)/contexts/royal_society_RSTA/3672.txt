4. Summary

Once the effects of secondary processes are removed, the original hydrogen isotope ratios of
water in the Earth, Mars and Vesta, along with the C- and S-type asteroids, cover a relatively
narrow range (approx. 5D —100%o to —590%o). This relative water homogeneity indicates that
these materials shared a water source. The differentiated bodies (the Earth, Mars and Vesta)
could have sourced their water from the C- and S-type asteroids, as the latter formed prior
to terrestrial planet accretion. Oxidation of S-type asteroids almost certainly occurred prior to
terrestrial planet accretion in the early Solar System, causing an increase in the bulk rock D/H
ratio. However, the low water content of the S-type asteroids means their high D/H ratio could
have been overprinted, at least in part, by the low D/H ratio of the C-type asteroids, which have
much higher water contents. This simplistic view is complicated by the fact that no combination
of chondrite meteorite compositions (as a proxy for parental asteroid compositions) has been
able to recreate the bulk Earth. In particular, nitrogen and noble gases suggest that solar wind or
nebula gas played a role in the Earth’s formation. Inner Solar System nebula hydrogen gas (H2) or
solar wind would have had a low D/H ratio at the time of terrestrial planet formation, thus this
addition could have further overprinted the high D/H ratios of the S-type asteroid component in
the terrestrial planets.
