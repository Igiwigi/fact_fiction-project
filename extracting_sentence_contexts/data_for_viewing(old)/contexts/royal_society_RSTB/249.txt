together, then the origin of the single basi-occipital condyle might be accounted for as
the modification of a structure which was already foreshadowed in the axial skeleton.
The single condyle would thus lose none of its importance as a mark of affinity
between the animals in which it is found, but as the mystery of its existence disappeared
it would be realised that the change from the Amphibian to the Reptilian mode of
union of the skull with the vertebrae does not necessarily imply a wide difference in
organization. It is interesting to remark that the body of the atlas is very short in
the great majority of Reptiles, Birds, and Mammals, as it theoretically might be if its
anterior half were incorporated with the skull. Some evidence in support of this origin
for the single basi-occipital condyle is perhaps furnished by the fact that the bone is

conspicuously large and rounded in the Ichthyopterygia, which preserve a larger
number of Labyrinthodont characters than any other order of fossil Reptilia, while
in Reptiles which have lost the technical distinctive marks of the Labyrinthodonts it
enters further into the skull, and is received between the ex-occipital bones, though at
