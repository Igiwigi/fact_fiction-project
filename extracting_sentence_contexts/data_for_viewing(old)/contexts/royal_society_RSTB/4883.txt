ON THE YIELD OF WHEAT AT ROTHAMSTED, 91

of the wind. The number of meteorological elements might be made to exceed even
the longest series of crop records available, for the Rothamsted wheat records provide,
after necessary deductions, only 60 yields. Consequently, if the computer were pro-
vided not with yield data at all, but with an equal number of values composed at random,
he would still be able to express them with perfect accuracy in terms of the weather
records, for the number of unknowns available would exceed the number of equations
for them to satisfy.

It is of more practical importance that even when we have selected a number of
meteorological variables which is less than the number of crops recorded, a strong
semblance of dependence may be produced, even when fictitious data, unrelated to the
weather, are substituted for the true crops. For let there be Â» values of the dependent
variate y and n each of the q meteorological variates ,, #,, ...,2,. If now we obtain
a partial regression equation

showing the apparent dependence of y upon a, ..., a,, then the correlation between
y and Y, namely R, will be the multiple correlation of y with a, ... , x,, and will be
greater than the correlation of y with any other linear function of 2,,...,a,. Since
R is necessarily positive (or zero), as was noticed by Hooker (10, p. 7), there will
be generally an appearance of correlation produced in this way, even if no such
relation really exists. This effect becomes particularly marked if the number in the
sample is small.
