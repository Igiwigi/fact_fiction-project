In rea-
lity, the work described the spatial distribution of burning and
short-term temporal trends in fire; the results of which have
been questioned [24,25]. If we are to debate the use of fire as a management tool, it
is essential that authors ensure that the press releases associ-
ated with their findings accurately reflect the content of their
research as well as the uncertainty associated with ongoing
research questions. At the same time, it is also essential that
journalists reporting on this clearly contentious topic do not
just rely on the content of press releases from campaigning
organizations but verify facts by reading the actual paper
and consulting with an independent academic expert not
involved in the study. Journalists reporting on scientific find-
ings need to decide whether their duty is to report science or
further their own or others’ agendas. Journalists should
preferably adopt a neutral tone and make a clear distinction
between research reporting and opinion pieces.
