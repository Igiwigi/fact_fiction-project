-€ That the blood acts upon aldoxime in the same manner as permanganate is almost

Zertain. To assure myself that such is the case outside the body, blood rendered
ark by aldoxime was dialysed and the dialysed liquor was found to yield the

oad of nitrites. The dialysed liquor also smelt of aldehyde, but the presence of

Sacetic acid was not always proved. The smell of aldehyde is always developed after

‘Padding aldoxime to blood. Aldehyde is evidently less quickly oxidised by the blood

Sthan is hydroxylamine, and this fact would, perhaps, favour the view of a passive as

opposed to an active oxidation.

= The development of the aldehyde smell before the change of colour in the blood

galso points to the primary splitting up of the aldoxime molecule.

g Judging by these experiments on blood, there seems, therefore, no reason to doubt

“Sthat aldoxime is by that fluid split up into hydroxylamine and aldehyde, and that
hydroxylamine is further oxidised into nitrous acid. The further oxidation of
