and the Amazon have a strong influence over the global
carbon cycle and climate, but 10% or fewer of these species
are represented by any trait data. Clearly, a great deal of
work is required to increase the amount of data available
for all plant species, but especially for tropical plant species.
The lack of trait data (even easy-to-measure traits like LMA)
for such a high proportion of tropical plant species mirrors
general biogeographical biases that are present in many dis-
ciplines of ecology. Consequently, there is a limited breadth
of data for global vegetation models or other models that
are parametrized with functional traits to predict future eco-
system functions [11]. The low representation of traits from
species grown at FTBG highlights the fact that botanic gar-
dens are an untapped resource that can be used to rapidly
increase the availability of trait data for these models, as
well as for other areas of ecology and conservation research.

(b) Potential advantages and concerns of functional
ecology research in botanic gardens

Several of the challenges associated with the acquisition of
functional plant trait data in situ can be mitigated by working
in botanic gardens. Botanic gardens are often designed with
the intent of pubic engagement and thus are commonly
located near urban centres [30]. Networks of well-maintained
