Proof. First note that the rate function I(€) is a (strictly) convex function, since Z¢ is positive
definite. Since UM k=1 Ti ;, 8 open and I(é) is a continuous function, it holds that

inf [(&)= inf [(é).

Moreover, since I(&) is continuous and Ut 1 Th ik Compact, the infimum is attained. The fact that
