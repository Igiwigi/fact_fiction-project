film of gas could be formed, even in vacuo, in a few seconds after the exposure
of a new surface. To meet this objection a more drastic treatment was devised.
Velocity measurements were made while the mercury was in motion. The tap T was
adjusted so that the mercury overflowed at C at the rate of about 3 ¢.c. per second,
On considering this, together with the dimensions of the dish, it is clear that no part
of the surface exists for more than a small fraction of a second. Owing to the fact
that the mercury in D was soon exhausted, accurate measurements could not be made.
However, it can be said that the maximum emission velocity from the continuously
forming mercury surface was 2°15+°05 volts. This is practically the same value as
that obtained for distilled Zn, Cd, and Hg. It seems extremely unlikely that any
retarding film could be formed on the Hg surface in this experiment, hence it is
concluded that 2°15 volts represents the actual emission velocity from Hg. The
agreement with the distillation experiments supports the view that metals prepared
by distillation iz vacuo are also free from surface films.

In the course of this experiment evidence was obtained which indicates that photo-
electrons are emitted nearly equally in all directions. The photo-electric current from
C to A was measured in the absence of an electric field between C and B—(1) with, (2)
