This butterfly is representative of the very large class of bottle-green, purple and
blue iridescent insects, the colour of which is usually not very bright but velvety, and
sometimes scarcely perceptible. In this type of iridescence can be included the
British day-flying moths, Callimorpha dominula, Linn., and some burnets, also the
butterflies like Apatura iris, Linn., ete. E. deione resembles this last insect in that
specimens from many localities are a velvety blue, which is only visible when looking
from the base of the wing to the apex. A section of one of these scales is shown in
Plate 1, fig. 21. It is heavily pigmented with dense black pigment throughout.
Generally, no cuticle is to be seen in the striee, c, even when the scales have been
bleached with chlorine. The lower membrane, ), is, as usual, attached to the upper
by means of bands of chitin, d. No cuticle or other structure could be detected, even
on restaining bleached sections. In fact, with insects like C. dominula, in which
the scales on the lower surface are similar to those on the upper (except for the
absence of any coloured sheen), there is no means of telling the two layers apart
when seen in section, unless one of them has been previously very carefully marked.

This insect is representative of another large group which have golden or silver
patches and spots, such as occur in many of the British species of Plusia, In the
case of this insect there is a pattern on the underside of the wings which is like
gold foil. It has been suggested by BreperMANN that a large air content, combined
with a suitable folding of the scale, is sufficient to cause an effect like silver, but, as
was pointed out on p. 8, this would only give a brilliant white appearance, like the
