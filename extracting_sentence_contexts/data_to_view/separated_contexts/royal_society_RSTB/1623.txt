adjustment to yarying hydrostatic pressures, bub Low fax this method is pyailablu
during the changes of level which are encountered im ordinary loeomotion is
doubtfal, and on this point two suggestions may be mide :—(1) Th may be possible
that the increase of external pressure whiecli accompanies descent, conditions ay
increased rate of seeretion, while a diminution of pressure during ascent involves
a like aceeleration of the absorptive process, with the result that if such verticul
moyements are not toe rapid or sudden, or too extensive, the processes of secretion
or absorption may keep pace with them, and the Fish retuin a plane of equilibrium
at all levels; (2) without entirely denying that the former suggestion may be trie in
some subordinate degree, it may yet be conjectured that pressure adjustment by
such means is more likely ta be of advantage to the Wish during slow or gradwal
changes of depth, such as may occur in the course of diurnal, seasonal, or other
periodic migrations, than in such ordinary and rapid changes of level as are chayae-
teristic of normal locomotion. The slaw rate af gaseous séeretion and absorption
renders it difficult to accept unreservedly the first alternative, and this objection
is further supported by many features in their habits, which Lend to prove that most:
Physoclistt have but a comparatively restricted yertical range, in so far us ordinary
locomotor movements aré concerned, as well as by certain facts already quoted. *
The second suggestion has also this much in its favour—that even a slow rate of
secretion and absorption would he distinctly advantageous to these Fishes in view
of the varying pressures to which they are exposed during periods of migration,
whether the latter ave-due to variations in temperature and food supply, or to their
breeding habits, On the whole we incline to the opinion that most Physoclists have
but a restricted capacity for pressure adjustment during ordinary locomotion, and,
in this respect, are less favourably situated than the Physostomi. Leaving the Physoelisis, we may next proceed (o discuss in the light of Monxau's
researches the mode in which pressure adjustment is effected in the Physostomi.
