following MCA infarcts; [52,53]). Thus, lesion studies
provide limited information about the cortical source of the
direct pathway.

Researchers using functional neuroimaging to investigate
speech motor control initially presumed that the larynx was
represented at the ventral-most extent of primary motor


cortex [54], in the location that would be expected from the
larynx’s position within the throat and proximity to the hom-
ologous region in non-human primates [29,55,56]. However,
later studies demonstrated that the human brain in fact
has two separate representations of the larynx, at either end
of the orofacial somatotopic map of the precentral gyrus
[19-23]. Though the dual larynx representations have not
been consistently labelled as such in earlier brain imaging
research, they were nonetheless consistently present near
the predicted location [54].

The dLMC is located in canonical primary motor cortex in
Brodmann Area (BA) 4, which is cytoarchitecturally defined
as the region containing a high abundance of giant pyramidal
neurons in cortical layer V—these pyramidal neurons are the
source of the descending motor pathways of the corticospinal
