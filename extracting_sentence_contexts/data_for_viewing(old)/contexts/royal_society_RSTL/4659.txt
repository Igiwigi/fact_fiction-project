164 MR. MARSHALL ON THE DEVELOPMENT

parently blending with those of both auricles. | There are no valves along its conrse,
but the mouth of each of its cardiac branches is guarded with a fine yalve, that of
the coronary vein being the largest. The wide orifice of the vyessel into the right
auricle is marked above, below and to the right, by a slight rim, but there is no
Thebesian valve, the absence of which, in this and all the other examples of double
vena cava 8uperior in which the point is capable of being determined (Nos. 1,4, 12,30,
31), suggests a comparison with the fact that it is also absent in those large quadru-
peds which have a left vena cava superior or a left azygos venous trunk. The Eusta-
chian valve is small and perforate ; its left cornu does not reach the lower border of
the fossa ovalis, owing, as it were, to the intervention of the large orifice of the left
Superior cava. The foramen ovale is quite closed.

The second example (No. 31) of double vena cava superior which I have to men-
tion, occurred in the heart of a child between four and five years of age; in the ven-
tricular portion of which there are some defects. The auricles, however, are perfectly
shut off from each other. The lower part only of the left superior cava is present in
the preparation, that vessel having been divided opposite the left pulmonary veins :
it is very large and muscular, and receives the coronary and one other principal
cardiac vein, the orifices of both being provided with valves. The opening of the
