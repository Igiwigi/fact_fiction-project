also Peralta-Ferriz et al. [60]). In the summer, the REF simulation and the MYO reanalysis show a
shallower ML depth than the ITP measurements, including a minimum depth of hyj,~10m over
the entire Arctic Ocean. The REF simulation ML depths agree with the ITP measurements in the
Beaufort Sea but underestimate the ML depths in the pack ice north of Greenland. Similar maps
of the ML temperature (Twix) and salinity (Six) (not shown) illustrate the tendency of the REF
simulation to overestimate (both against ITP and MYO) the heating of the ML in August, which
in turn results in additional melt and a lower Smix.

In figures 8-11, we show maps of the main sea ice and ML characteristics. We show the absolute
values for the reference REF simulation and the relative values with respect to REF for all other :
model simulations. We have computed these maps for all months but choose here to only show :=

August. This choice is motivated first by the fact that August has the largest differences between Sy
the different sensitivity model runs in our study and also because August sea ice concentration is 2
often underestimated in current sea ice models [58]. aed

Comparing first REF, MLD_CST and MLD_MIN_2M, we see that switching off the prognostic 22

with a homogeneous increase in the mean ice thickness (+10 cm-25 cm, figure 9) over most of the
Arctic basin for MLD_CST and a corresponding increase in the ML salinity (more than +2 PSU,
