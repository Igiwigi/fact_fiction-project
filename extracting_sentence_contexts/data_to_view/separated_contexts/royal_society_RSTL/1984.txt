the absorption and radiation of heat. The metallic reflexions and polished
surface of the whole family of humming-birds is admirably suited to their
habits ; and the colours of the wings of the Lepidoptera, in the class of insects,
there is little doubt, serve some similar purpose, in maintaining the tempera-
ture of the animals at the proper mean. In proportion to the diminution of
temperature and the distance from the equator, a corresponding dilution of
colour in animals takes place, till in temperate countries it is almost uniformly
of a sober gray.
