It has, however, very little, if any, effect on the velocities of the
boundaries ; and the ratio of these (u/c) is absolutely unaffected. It is indeed striking to watch the calm
indifference with which these flaws are treated by the travelling colour boundaries, and to contrast the
behaviour of the latter with that of the galvanometer needle. The facts are explicable on the assumption
that the flaws reduce the current by reducing the value of A, leaving the current density (C/A), and
therefore the actual velocities, as well as their ratio, unaffected. It is obvious that, in such a case, the
experiment must be regarded as finished as soon as flaws appear, where the object is to test the truth of
the equation involving the original, and only known, value of A; but that, for the determination of u/v
(or of p), the experiment may be continued as usual till the boundaries meet. These rules haye been
observed in all cases.
