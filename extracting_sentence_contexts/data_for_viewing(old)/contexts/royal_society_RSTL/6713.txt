recuryed spines, it will be at; once seen, are eminently fitted to retain annelids or other
such, prey, and to cause! every motion of the struggling victim to contribute to its own
laceration and destruction, while the structure and mode of attachment of the eruciform
base- is admirably calculated to resist the force and motions it has to sustain in such en-
counters. But these spicula, although exceedingly numerous, are not the only organs
capable. of retaining intruders into the body of the sponge with which it is furnished:
there are, in addition, numerous large multihamate birotulate spicula dispersed in various
positions, on the sides of the interstitial cavities of the sponge, each of the rotulz con-
8isting of seven or eight stout recuryed flattened radii, which if immersed in any straggling
animal would be capable of sustaining a vastly greater amount of force than many of
the spiculated quadriradiate ones combined could endure without injury ; and that their
S egpecial office is that of auxiliary retentive organs is well demonstrated by the fact that
Â© the trenchant, edges of the flattened radii are all at right angles to the line of force

Z they appear destined. by nature to secure the prey, while its own struggles among the

Sbut, by means widely different from those I have previously described.
