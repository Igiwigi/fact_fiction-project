terquemi; while on the other hand, specimens are not uncommon where
the costae become more numerous and stronger, so that six or eight costae are visible
over much of the test. In these cases new names have been assigned, such as F. octo-
costata, F. baueri, F. procera, or the specimens have been recorded under F. sulcata or
F. multicostata. The form is, in fact, as noted above under F. sulcata, an intermediate
link between the fully costate F. sulcata and the smooth F. terquemi, and with many
specimens it becomes merely a matter of personal opinion under which of two names
they are recorded. The above somewhat wide interpretation of var. bicostata is supported in that neither
Burbach, nor Franke, nor Bartenstein and Brand, all of whom record several of the
‘species’ here put into the synonymy, make any real attempt to diagnose their
characters, or adequately to differentiate them one from another.
