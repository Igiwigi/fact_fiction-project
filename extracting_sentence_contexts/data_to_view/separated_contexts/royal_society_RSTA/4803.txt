It is tempting
therefore to assume that the triplet excitons in PDA are generated only by ISC, same as in DOO-
PPV solution. But previous time-resolved and steady-state measurements [16,23] showed that the
triplet excitons in PDA are generated within approximately 0.5 ps, which is too fast for an ISC
process. We thus believe that in fact SF dominates the triplet exciton photogeneration process in
PDA polymer chains. So how can we understand the EXPA(w) flat response here? The answer to
this puzzle is the low triplet energy in PDA.
