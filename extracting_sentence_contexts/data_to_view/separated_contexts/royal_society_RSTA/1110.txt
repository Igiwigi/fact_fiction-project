Optically, the crystal is negative just like the other two crystals; even
the magnitude of the molecular birefringence is of the same order. But, magnetically,
whereas for nitrates and carbonates y, — 7, > O for potassium chlorate 7, — 7 < 0. This difference in sign is probably due to the fact that the ClO,” ion is not plane as the
NO,~ and CO,~~ ions are, but pyramidal with Cl at the apex. Whatever may be
the explanation, the above fact regarding the signs of 1, — 7 when taken together with
the known negative birefringence of these crystals, would suggest a negative sign for
the magnetic double-refraction of ClO,” ions in solution as contrasted with the positive
sign for nitrate solutions. This is indeed so for the nitrate solutions ; the magnetic
double-refraction of chlorate solutions, however, does not seem to have been tested.
