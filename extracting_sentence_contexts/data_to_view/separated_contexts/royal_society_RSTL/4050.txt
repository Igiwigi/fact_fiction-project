We have no precise knowledge as to why the discharge of the jar can be
very slight without its ceasing to. excite contraction in the galvanoscopic frog; and
we have seen in those cases in which the lamellze of mica or of gold were interposed,
that the number of successive discharges from the jar, which acted upon the galva-
noscopic frog, was always less than when no lamellz were interposed. We must therefore pause a little before we can establish the fact of induced con-
tractions not being due to an electric discharge produced during the contraction of
the muscle; and since it is impossible for us to solve the question by direct experi-
ment, let us be guided by such analogies as appear to have the best possible foundation. I purpose examining this field of investigation in a general summary of all my electro-
physiological researches, which summary I hope s0on to be able to complete. PART 1I.
