Hirudinea, to that of the vertebrate may now be discussed. This system has been
shown to consist of certain vessels clothed with muscle-fibres, which have many
properties analogous to the heart muscle of vertebrates, both with regard to their
reactions to various drugs and to the possession of a rhythm which is intrinsic to the
muscle, but is normally regulated by nerves which come from the central neryous
system.

Embryology may again be referred to in endeavouring to explain the relationship
of such a contractile system to that which exists in vertebrates. The vertebrate
heart is formed by the fusion of two longitudinal vessels, which run parallel to one
another along the ventral side of the body. These vessels reach the mid-ventral
position by the growing round of the two lateral body folds ; before this occurs they
therefore lie in a very lateral position in the embryo, in fact, in the very position in
which the two longitudinal contractile vessels lie in Hirudo. In ‘The Origin of
Vertebrates,’ W. H. GaskrLt (13) has shown that an extremely close comparison can
be drawn between these two longitudinal vessels of the vertebrate embryo and the
two longitudinal venous sinuses of Limulus. The latter function as branchial vessels
supplying the blood to the branchize for aeration. The chief function of the
longitudinal contractile vessels of the leech, as has been explained in the second
chapter, is to supply the annular vessels, and through them the cutaneous capillary
system in which respiration takes place. Both in position and function the
longitudinal vessels of the leech are comparable to the longitudinal venous sinuses in
Limulus ; and the comparison between the longitudinal vessels of the vertebrate
embryo, which later form the heart, and the longitudinal venous sinuses of Limulus
