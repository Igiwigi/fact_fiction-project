Until then, the setae are used over and over ona variety of surfaces. Of all the
microscopic images of gecko setae in the literature, none document obvious evidence of wear. In
fact, the only wear appears to be in the form of the lipid gecko footprint [15]. Perhaps, it is the
wear of this fine lipid layer that protects the larger setal structure against constant abrasion in the
geckoâ€™s natural environment. This again points to a system-level requirement.
