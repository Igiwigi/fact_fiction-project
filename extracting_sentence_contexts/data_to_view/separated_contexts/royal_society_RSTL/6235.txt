C. V. WALKER ON MAGNETIC STORMS AND EARTH-CURRENTS. 93

each on the other, and without reference to the route pursued by the telegraph wire
itself in its course from station to station ; and deduced from his observations that * the
direction in which the currents travel . . .. . will be between 8. 28* W. and S. 75% W.; and
apparently strongest when the earth-connexions are N.K. and $,W.” The great inte-
rest attached to the fact that the direction of the current depends on the relative posi-
tions of the earth-connexions, and not on the direction of the wire itself, induced him
to make further observations, which confirmed that view. 'They were made on May 1,
2, 3, and 8, 1848. It was further ascertained that disturbances had been noticed on
the short line of telegraph that was led entirely under ground from the Strand to Nine
Elms. Taking this in connexion with the influence of the relative position of the earth-
connexions, he continues, ©* The most probable explanation appears to be that the cur-
Rents are terrestrial, of which a portion is conveyed along the wire, and rendered visible
Þy the multiplying action of the coil of the galvanometer.” I refer particularly to this
mmunication, because the two facts with which we have to deal—that currents are
Found travelling in the earth, and that a portion of snch currents comes under our notice in
She form of a derived current—are at the basis of all further inquiries into their nature.
£7 I have mentioned that the disturbances ceased to attract our notice after the close of
Me year 1848.
