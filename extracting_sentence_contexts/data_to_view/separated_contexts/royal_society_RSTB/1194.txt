- Symbiotic Micro-organisms (figs. 38-41) . That microbes may live in certain
organisms without producing apparent evil results, is now a well-established fact. Indeed symbiotic bacteria have been described as occurring even in the protoplasm of
a certain species of Amba (Bourne). In the coelomic fluid of the earthworm three
or four varieties of micro-organisms are usually present, but whether these are
symbiotic in the strict sense of the term, or whether they are parasitic may be
doubted.
