2eK+U (0,0k+U)

The characteristic velocity of E

p

which is the same as the characteristic velocity of ETP: U+V — U. On the other hand, for ETDe+
with (6, c) = (K + U,R) or (K + U, V), we obtain

ootepe (p,0°+°)

It is required that the principal subsystems satisfy the subcharacteristic condition [45]. In fact, the
condition in the present case:
