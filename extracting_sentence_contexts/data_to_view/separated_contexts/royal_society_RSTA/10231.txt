It would be an immense advantage if we could accept such a theory of the pure
gamete as has been here analysed as a physiological basis for the theory of heredity. We should then have a physiological origin for the ideas of regression and of ancestral
inheritance which statistics of heredity in populations have made familiar to
biometric workers. Unfortunately, even such a general pure gamete theory as we
have here dealt with, while leading to results which form a special case of the law of
ancestral heredity, is not sufficiently elastic to cover the observed facts. The lesson
