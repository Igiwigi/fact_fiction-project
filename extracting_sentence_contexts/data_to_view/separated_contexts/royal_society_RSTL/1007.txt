gene disengaged. The negative energy of the copper and the
positive energy of the zine are consequently again exerted,
enfeebled only by the opposing energy of the s0da in contact
with the copper, and the. process of electromotion continues,
as long as the chemical changes are capable of being carried
on. This theory in s0ome measure reconciles the hypothetical
principles of the action of the pile adopted by its illustrious
' inventor, with the opinions concerning the chemical origin of
GaLvanisM, Supported by the greater number of the British
philosophers, and it is confirmed and strengthed by many
facts and experiments. Thus the VoLratrc pile of 20 pairs of plates of copper and
zinc exhibits no permanent electromotive power when the con-
necting fluid is water free from air ;* for this substance does
not readily undergo chemical change, and the equilibrium
Seems to be capable of being permanently restored through
it. Concentrated sulphuric acid, which is a much more perfect
conductor, is equally inefficient, for it has little action upon
zinc, and is itself decomposed only by a very strong power.
