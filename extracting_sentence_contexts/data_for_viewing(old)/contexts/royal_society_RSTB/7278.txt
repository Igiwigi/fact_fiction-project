The spermatheca. In the pupa the spermathecal invagination, after being greatly lengthened,
is differentiated into a spermathecal duct and two saccular structures. The first is terminal
and represents the functional spermatheca proper and the second subterminal. The two
spermathecal sacs at first look identical, but soon the wall of the terminal sac becomes
thicker and provided with glandular cells near the outer periphery, while the wall of the
subterminal sac becomes thinner and its cells regress.

The glandular cells of the functional spermatheca secrete a fluid into its cavity, and the
other epithelial cells lay down the inner cuticular lining. Similar glandular cells to those
of the spermatheca proper appear on the middle portion of the spermathecal duct. Owing
to the fact that the duct is surrounded by a layer of longitudinal muscle these glandular
cells are separated from the lining epithelial cells as the mulberry-like structure described
in the adult.

The caecus. The caecal invagination extends deeply during the pupal stage until its lobes
reach the sixth abdominal segments. Its glandular wall attains its greatest thickness in the
old pupa, but the release of its secretion does not start until after the emergence of the fly.
It is also at this time that the caecus is provided with its muscular coat.
