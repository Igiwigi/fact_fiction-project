manifest that a full respect for the theory itself and for its illustrious author was nd
wanting.

«The very imperfect resemblance between the two systems of lines in the southern
hemisphere is of course no impeachment of the sufficiency of the theory, with corrected
numerical elements, to represent the natural phenomena in parts of the globe which
observation may not have reached. The degree of approximation to which it will do this
must depend upon the extent and correctness of the observation-basis from whence the
numerical elements are derived, and upon the order of the magnitudes comprehended in
the calculation. :

<'The evidence which the Plate affords that the calculation in the elaborate work
referred to differs s0 widely from the facts in the southern latitudes, shows how much
observations were wanting in those latitudes for the purpose of perfecting the theory,
and is an ample justification (if indeed any justification were necessary) of the exertions
which the last few years have witnessed to obtain them.”

I am greatly indebted to the Hydrographer, Captain RicfarDs, R.N., F.R.S., for his
kind permission to have the maps which accompany this Number of the Contributions
prepared at the Hydrographic Office, and am particularly obliged to the Assistant |
Hydrographer, Captain Freperck Jonn Evans, R.N., F.R.S., for the very valuable
superintendence which he has kindly given to their preparation and execution.

It may be desirable that T should add a few words in explanation of the sense in
which, in the present and in earlier papers, I have employed certain of the technical ex-
