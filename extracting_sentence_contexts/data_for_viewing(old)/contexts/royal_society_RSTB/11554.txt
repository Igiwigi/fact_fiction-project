detection of cues to pathogens lead to all-out aversion regardless
of the context? Certainly not. Probably, there are particular con-
textual factors against which avoidance behaviours are traded
off in favour of alternative fitness-promoting behaviours.

(b) Contextual factors influencing contact decisions

Much like how our food system weighs information regarding
pathogen presence against other factors such as nutritional
state in decisions regarding what to consume, our contact evalu-
ation system also regulates touch by considering factors beyond
cues to pathogen presence. We do not avoid contact with every-
body all of the time. In fact, there are good reasons to expect to
see trade-offs in decisions about whom to touch and when.

(i) Genetic relatedness

The first context in which we expect to see decisions to trade
off risks of contamination in favour of contact is genetic relat-
edness. The benefits of assisting kin (e.g. oneâ€™s offspring)
often would have outweighed the costs associated with infec-
tion. As shown by Case ef al. [64] and Stevenson & Repacholi
[65], disgust differs when pathogen cues emanate from differ-
ent groups of people. By and large, individuals identified as
kin are less likely to evoke disgust when it comes to physical
