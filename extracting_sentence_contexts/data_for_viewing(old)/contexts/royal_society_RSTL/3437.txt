the shortening of the fasciculus. I have not seen this in contracted fasciculi that
have not been wetted, and, therefore, conclude the sheath to be endowed with the re-
quisite elasticity for accommodating it to the varying form of its contents. But
where bullz are developed, the folds thus occasioned are strongly marked, and have
very probably been not unfrequently mistaken for transverse rugze upon the fasci-
culus. The fibrillee, however, are entirely independent of them, as may be seen in
'specimens taken from the Newt (fig. 76.) and Mouse (fig. 80.). In those Birds that
have been examined, the irritability has 80 speedily ceased, that no contraction has
been observed.

It is almost unnecessary to remark how completely the variety before noticed in
the proximity of the strize in all animals in contiguous and even the same fasciculi,
is illustrated and explained by the foregoing facts.

Such are the principal phenomena observed during that form of contraction which
I conceive to be analogous to the rigor mortis*; but it is undoubtedly necessary to
bear in mind, that the fasciculi in which they occur are in a condition very different
from those acting in the living body under the influence of volition. It is not by
any means intended to be implied, that the healthy movements of muscle are in every
respect such as have been now described; but it seems highly probable, that in kind,
at least, they are identical with them. Perhaps, therefore, the mechanism of volun-
tary motion may receive some elucidation from this phenomenon of lingering vitality.
A muscle, if cut whilst irritability remains, retracts to a greater or less extent, as is
seen every day in amputations ; this is by virtue of a tendency, always existing,
towards approximation of the discs, for if a piece 80 cut be immediately examined,
