Now, according to figs. 2 and 3, the halo should appear with a much darkened
central disc or pupil, this disc being surrounded by a relatively very faint band or
penumbra-like shading. For we see that the spreading of the rays, according to the
inverse square law, has much reduced the maximum due to RaC, I am supposing
now that we can translate the effects in air into effects in the mineral by simply
shortening the ranges by the amounts proper to the greater stopping power of the
mineral, That is, I assume that the curve iin the ionisation in air is followed
in its general features in the mineral.

Many haloes may indeed appear to conform fairly well with the distribution of
ionisation shown in figs. 2 and 3. Photographs issued elsewhere show such haloes.*
But, in point of fact, when we come to examine the halo in its earlier stages of
development we find the appearance indicated by figs. 2 and 3 (ante) entirely
departed from. Published photographs show that in its earlier stages the halo
consists of concentric rings—or, more strictly, of shells—of varying density of colour. ¢

In many respects we find that the curve fig. 1 very faithfully represents the
development of the uranium halo. In the first stages we have a delicate ring which
is clearly representative of, although not accurately agreeing with, the remarkable
maximum which is placed at the distance in air of 2°2 cm. from the centre or origin.
Later we find this ring darkened up inside, and the first appearances of RaC
presented as a faint outlying ring. But here there is plainly a discordance. The
appearance of the shell due to RaC should be delayed till a much later stage in the
development of the halo. Plainly, according to the ionisation curve, the central
