This yields
a new stability result that is not covered by the results of [24], irrespective of the value of Q. It is
worth noting that the presence of the cosmological constant reduces the range (3.10) of K-values
for which stability is guaranteed. In the same way as for case 3, we expect this restriction for K to
be sharp and that Kasner solutions outside this range are unstable near t = 0.

(c) Case1 =

This case where Jx, Q, A € R are unrestricted and Jy = QJx must hold in general as a consequence 1 P
of (2.26) has led to the most significant new stability results that we can establish in this article. :g
The significance of this case is due to the fact that the unique hypersurface orthogonal Killing [3
vector field of g is Y —- QX—see (2.14) and (2.15)—and it can be an arbitrary linear combination of a)
the two eigenvector fields X and Y. As we discuss above, this means that the class of perturbations [8
in case 1 is not included in the otherwise more general classes of perturbations discussed in [9,10]. 3S
It is worth noting that due to (3.9) the range of K-values for which our stability result holds in this oe
case is reduced even further in comparison to cases 2 and 3. As for cases 2 and 3, we expect this
restriction for K to be sharp and that Kasner solutions outside this range are unstable near t = 0.
