the larger of the two can be decided on—depends only on the
ratio of the two objectively specified quantities. Thus, for
example, the speed and accuracy with which a 6 g weight can
be distinguished from a 4 g weight are the same as the speed
and accuracy with which a 6 kg weight can be distinguished
from a 4kg weight. Similarly, the speed and accuracy with
which a set with numerosity of 6 can be distinguished from a
set with numerosity 4 are the same as the speed and accuracy
with which a numerosity of 60 can be discriminated form a
numerosity of 40. The dependence of discriminability solely
on the objectively measured ratio has two consequences
called the size effect and the distance effect. The size effect
refers to the fact that the discriminability of given numerical
difference depends on the size of the two discriminanda.
Thus, for example, a difference of 2 is easily recognized
when the discriminanda are 4 and 2, but the same difference
is unrecognizable by the non-verbal system for representing
numerosity when the discriminanda are 52 and 50. The distance

effect refers to the fact that the discriminability of two numeros-
ities depends on how widely separated they are. We—and all
other vertebrate species tested—more readily discriminate 10
from five than we discriminate six from five. Both the size
effect and the distance effect are implied by Weber's Law.
This property of the non-verbal representation leads to its
