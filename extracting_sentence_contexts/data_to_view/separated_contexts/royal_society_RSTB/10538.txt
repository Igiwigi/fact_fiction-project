Independent race model

Two facts led to the independent race model of stop-signal per-
formance: (i) the probability of response inhibition depends on
the time available to detect the stop signal before the Go
response is executed and (ii) non-cancelled RTs are faster
than RTs on no-stop-signal trials. These characteristics are
found in the large majority but not all studies of countermand-
ing [6,7]. These two facts suggested that response inhibition
depends on the outcome of a race between a GO process,
initiated by the Go stimulus, and a STOP process, initiated
by the stop signal. If the STOP process finishes before the GO
process, the response is inhibited, producing a cancelled trial. If the GO process finishes before the STOP process, the
response is not inhibited, producing a non-cancelled trial.
