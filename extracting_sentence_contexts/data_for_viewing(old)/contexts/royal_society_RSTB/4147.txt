have given may last for several hours, perhaps four or five.

Taking these facts together it seems quite probable that the oxidation which
observers have been accustomed to regard as that of resting muscle is largely the
after-effect of previous contractions, and in order to make any just estimate of


AOTIVITY IN STRIATED MUSCLE AND THE SUBMAXILLARY GLAND. 155

whether the muscle was a fit subject for estimation of the kind, one would have to
know its history for some hours before the experiment took place:

To turn now to the facts which have led to the above conclusions. CHAUVEAU
and KAurFMANN obtained figures varying from 0°0082 to 00029 c.c. per gramme per
minute in three experiments; Verzir, in 11 experiments, gives figures from
0°0086 to 0:0023.*

In five experiments on muscle not artificially stimulated we obtained data which
varied from 0°055 to 0°0052. These we append, together with some remarks upon
the extent to which the muscle could really be regarded as resting, to judge from its
present and previous history.
