Mick Brown Could I refer here to the most beautiful experiments by Tarlan [Hajilou]
[18]? She looked at these nanoindentation effects on a steel with very,
very low carbon content, and then did the same test on a steel with ten
times as much carbon at 0.2 wt. %. What you saw was that the presence
of hydrogen greatly increased the ease of dislocation formation, and
removed the upper yield stress, in the higher-carbon steel, but had little
or no effect in the very low carbon steel. Now there is something to
explain. It must be a synergy of some kind that has to do with the role of
the carbon in the cores of these dislocations. I do not see any other way
of thinking about it, but I wonder if people agree.

Xavier Feaugas This is similar to the case of zirconium alloyed with oxygen. In fact, it
is the interaction of hydrogen and oxygen that modifies the core of the
dislocations and promotes the slip.

Adrian Sutton This comes back to George [Smith]â€™s point about the significance of
carbon in the story.

Salim Brahimi This discussion is fascinating, and it is wonderful that I get to ask a
question to an audience like this, because I have been studying this
problem for years. It is a fundamental question, because we have listed
all these models but there is no clear answer as to which model applies
