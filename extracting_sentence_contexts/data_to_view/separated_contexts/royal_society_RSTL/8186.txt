The only author
who has accepted the genus Pothriodon of AYMARD is Professor GERVAIs, who, in his
* Palcontologie Frangaise,‚Äù p. 192, says that the Z/yopotamus is to be distinguished
from Bothriodon; but I have not been able to find any reasons adduced in the de-
scriptions of the two genera why Professor GeERVa1s considers them distinct, or on what
characters he has founded his distinction. Notwithstanding the care with which I insti-
tuted my comparison, I could not detect any differences between the /yopotamidea from
Puy and those from Hempstead ; and, s0 far as I can see, their separation into two
distinct genera is entirely unfounded. Professor GERvAa1s has described many portions of
jaws from different localities in France, and has given them different specific names, the
distinction being founded on size and on the fact of their having been found in different
localities. As I reserve the discussion of specific differences for the end of my paper,
1 will not enter into the criticism of these doubtful species just now. In the year 1861, Professor RiTIMEYER figured and described, with great accuracy,
some few upper molars of a small Hyopotamoid animal from Egerkingen.
