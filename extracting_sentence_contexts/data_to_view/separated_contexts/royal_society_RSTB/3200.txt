It is also possible that the vessels became blocked in the case of the plants
which died subsequently, but no investigations in this direction were made. Ursprunet has repeated the same experiment on the Beech by cooling with ice
14-centim. lengths of branches 60-80 centims. long and found that the leaves
shrivelled in two to seven days, and that the same result followed when a similar
length of the branch was killed by induction currents, heat or ether. UrRsprune
argues that since the blocks are formed in the vessels only at the boundaries of the
living portions, the fact that the leaves droop sooner when a long length is killed than
when a short one is treated, shows that the loss of conductivity is not due to blocking
of the vessels. In some cases UrsprunG could find no blocks in the vessels at all,
but this is always difficult to demonstrate when the blocks are few and far apart. In
any case the first premise is not always correct, for blocks appear at various points in
the peripheral wood vessels along the whole length of a stem of Wistaria killed by
heat, provided that the transpiration current is resumed for a time after treatment.
