9â€”LOGATION OF THE FOCI OF THE SHOCKS In order to estimate the position of the foci from the amplitude distributions
produced by the different shocks it is necessary to make certain simplifying assump-
tions. The actual amplitude of the earth movements produced at a station as a result
of the passage of a given earthquake will depend in actual fact on a number of factors
of which it is difficult to estimate the influence. Such factors are the details of the
local and distant topography, the nature of the building on which the instrument is
mounted, the bearing of the wall on which the instrument is mounted relative to the
direction of the focus from the station, and other factors. As a first approximation
we assume that the amplitude recorded by the Jaggar shock recorders varies inversely
as the distance of the focus from the station and is independent of the other factors.
