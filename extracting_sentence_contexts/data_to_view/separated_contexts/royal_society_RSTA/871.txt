The dark black regions (W2) represent phases with two pairs of Weyl [=
nodes. They also appear as a regular array but are well separated from each other and much S
smaller in area compared to W. In fact, W2 can be viewed as the overlapping regions of two : 2
adjacent W phases, as seen in the inset of figure 7, which shows the details near d/ = 10. In the : &
rest of the phase diagram (white regions, Wo), the spectrum is gapped, even though the gap may ih
be numerically small (see, for example, the spectrum at point A shown in the first subpanel). : S

The evolution of the spectrum along a vertical cut in the phase diagram, from point A to point D8
E, is illustrated in the subpanels of figure 7. As vz is increased at this particular value of d, the : ea
lowest branch of the spectrum is pushed down by the increasing Zeeman splitting to touch E = 0, 1g

entering the W2 phase (AB).
