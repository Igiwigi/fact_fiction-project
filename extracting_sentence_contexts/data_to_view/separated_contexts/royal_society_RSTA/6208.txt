To illustrate research in this area, we now give
an incomplete history of de Jongh’s theorem for arithmetical theories (see de Jonghet al. [8] for
a more complete history). De Jongh [3] proved that L(HA) = IPC—; in other words, he proved
that HA satisfies the de Jongh property for IPC. Leivant [9] showed using proof theoretic means
that QL(HA) = IQC; van Oosten later gave a model theoretic proof of the same fact. De Jongh
et al. [8] proved that HA has the de Jongh property for several classes of intermediate logics. The
following propositions are immediate from proposition 2.5.
