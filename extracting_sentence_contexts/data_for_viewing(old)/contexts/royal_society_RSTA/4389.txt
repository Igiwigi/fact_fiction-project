Our results presented here indicate the cell-cycle informational architecture is structured to
localize information storage within those same control kernel nodes. These results indicate
that the control kernel—which plays a prominent role in the regulation of cell-cycle function
(by regulating the attractor landscape)—is a key component in the distinctive informational
architecture of the fission yeast cell-cycle network, playing both a prominent role in information
storage and in the flow of information within in the network.

While it is conceivable that these patterns are a passive, secondary, attribute of biological
organization arising via selection on other features (such as robustness, replicative fidelity, etc.), : =

we think the patterns are most likely to arise because they are intrinsic to biological function—that Sy
is, they direct the causal mechanisms of the system in some way, and thereby constitute a directly 2
selectable trait [38,39]. If information does in fact play a causal role in the dynamics of biological aed
systems, than a fundamental understanding of life as a physical process has the potential to 22
open up completely unexplored sectors of physics, as we know of no other class of physical : Sg
systems where information is necessary to specify its state. Taking a more forward-thinking DNS
and necessarily speculative look at what our results suggest of the physics underlying life, we : a
regard the most distinctive feature to be in how informational and causal structure intersect : &

(consistent with other suggestions that life is distinguished by the ‘active’ use of information,
e.g. [22,31,40-43]). Evidence for this view comes from the fact that the integration of the network
is a better predictor of the states of individual nodes, than vice versa (figure 8), an asymmetry
perhaps related to the functionality of the network. If the patterns of information processing
observed in the biological network are indeed a joint product of information and causal structure,
as our results suggest, they may be regarded as an emergent property of topology and dynamics.
