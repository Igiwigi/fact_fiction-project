Referring
to Table I., its absorption is found to be 1195. In the last Table the vapour of acetic
ether, possessing only one-thirtieth of the tension of the ammonia, produces apparently
the same effect; its absorption is also 1195. Such facts give one entirely new ideas
of the capabilities of matter, and our wonder will not be diminished by the results to be
recorded further on. With both gases and vapours we find that it does not follow that a gas which produces
a larger effect than another at one tension should surpass that other at all tensions. Some gases start from a lower level than others, but finally attain an equa), or even a
greater elevation.
