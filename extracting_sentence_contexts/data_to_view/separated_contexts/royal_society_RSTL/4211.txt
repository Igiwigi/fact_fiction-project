For it then becomes apparent, that the number of cases in which the nucleus is
surrounded on all sides by the same number of zones, indicating that the concentric
mode of growth has prevailed from the very first, are very few; but that in by far
the larger proportion of specimens, there is a slight excentricity of the nucleus, with
a larger number of zones on one side than on the other, as in Plate IX. figs. 1, 3;
indicating that the first-formed zones have been incomplete circles, owing to a
restriction of the gemmation of the nucleus to one part of its periphery. This is
shown extremely well by decalcified specimens of the animal, no two of which, in
fact, precisely resemble one another as to the mode in which the first zone of segments
originates in the nucleus. Thus in the specimen represented in Plate IV. fig. 1, of
which the nucleus is represented on a larger scale in fig.
