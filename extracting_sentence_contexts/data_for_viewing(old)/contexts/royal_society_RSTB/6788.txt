influences during the Roman period. A black organic deposit containing Romano-
British pot rubbish excavated by Mr C. W. Phillips in a former course of the Old
Croft river at Welney was found to contain Scirpus maritimus, S. lacustris, Oenanthe
lachenalii, Apium graveolens, Suaeda maritima? and some partially charred fragments of
oak.

Between the phase of erosion of the upper peat surface and the estuarine conditions
of Romano-British times, there must have been a period of comparative stagnation and
this is presumably represented by the peat lining of the old roddon channel at Peacock’s
Farm, and by the greasy (silt-containing) peat filling the channels of the old runs. This
peat often contains masses of leaves and twigs of sallow (Salix cinerea), and in the two
instances where the mollusca have been examined, Dr Kennard has said that they
indicate a deep, sluggish, fresh-water stream. The primary fact of marine trans-
gression during Romano-British times seems beyond question, and as we should expect,

it is clear that it affected both the Woodwalton-Wisbech area and other parts of the
fens. What remains uncertain is the possible relation between deposition of the upper
silts and formation of the lake marls. Historical evidence collected by Dr Darby
indicates that the meres were in existence about 1020 (Darby 1936). Only six centuries
therefore separate this period from the close of the Roman occupation, and there is

thus a distinct possibility that they already existedin Roman times, or that they might
