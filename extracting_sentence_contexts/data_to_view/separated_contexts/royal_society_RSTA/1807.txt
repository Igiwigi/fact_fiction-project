We investigated carbohydrates, major components of phytoplankton exudates, to explore
differences in the chemical composition of the two DOM sources. The relative abundance of
carbohydrates in phytoplankton exudates appears variable among phytoplankton species (26-
80% [68]; 6-13% [28]) and tends to increase in the stationary phase [68]. These two facts can
explain why F. cylindrus exudates had a lower contribution of carbohydrates to the DOM
(4%) when compared with C. neogracilis (18%). Polymeric and monomeric carbohydrates were
consistently shown to be used in short-term (days) biodegradation experiments [69,70]. The lower
content of this labile source of organic carbon in the exudate of the sea ice diatom when compared
with the water column diatom could explain the lower number of bacterial strains growing on this
DOM.
