Torques that act on our pendulum as it rotates, in addition to that produced
by our source mass, have several origins.

1. Nonlinear elastic torques associated with the fibre, which we may approximate with a
Taylor series expansion: t = â€”(k10 + kz? + k305). Symmetry suggests that ky should be
zero, but in fact we have found significant non-zero values for this term in our tests. Fortunately, ky proves to have negligible effect on our results. k3 however does have a
marginally significant effect.

2. Dissipative fibre torques.
