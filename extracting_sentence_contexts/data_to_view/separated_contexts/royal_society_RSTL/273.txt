In this
case the intensity of the light will obviously be a maximum


transmitted through crystallized Bodies. 195

when the ray RS is parallel to mz, and a ray PQ will, within
certain limits, suffer less' diminution of lustre than a ray TV
falling with the same angle of incidence on the other side
of RS. When RS and mn are perpendicular to the surfaces of AB,
and when PQ and TV form equal angles with the perpendi-
cular RS, their intensity should be equal; but this is by, no
means the case, for the transmitted light which is incident on
the side T of RS appears to have a different character from
that which is. incident on the other side. We must therefore
suppose that there is some other peculiarity of structure in the
agate, connected probably with that particular kind of crys-
tallisation which polarises light, to which this curious fact
must be ascribed,*

The intensity of the light transmitted by the agate is like-
wise affected by its polarising property. If a ray Rr, Plate V.,
fig. 4, is incident upon a piece of agate AB, s0 as to be polarised
by reflection from the second surface, then, since it is polarised
during its passage from 7 to E, the bright image will suffer
total reflection at E, while the nebulous image will be trans-
mitted like common light in the direction EG. If the agate is
now turned round go* the nebulous image will suffer total
reflection at E, while the bright image will penetrate the se-
cond surface at E like common light.
