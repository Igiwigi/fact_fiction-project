Fig. 75 is more especially liable to such an interpretation, inasmuch as the surface-
view can hardly be said to yield any suggestion of the presence of such a sub-
ectodermal ganglionic plate as that described. Here, on each side of the medullary
plate, we find an oblong area bounded behind by the transverse cleavage-line defining
the first distinct somite ; laterally by a tolerably definite boundary which is coincident
with the inner limit of the parietal ccelomic cavity; medially by the edge of the
medullary plate ; and anteriorly by a well-marked opaque band, parallel with the
pedicle of the acustico-facial ganglion, and skirting the posterior part of the periphery
of the circular auditory plate. The broad elongated area so defined is in tolerably
obvious series with the great Trigeminus-plate in front ; and also with the acustico-
facial ganglion and its pedicle. That it is not to be interpreted as the forward
prolongation of the paraxial zone of mesoderm is evidenced by the fact that the
true anterior prolongation of the somitic series is itself visible, in both of the
figures (75 and 76), in the shape of a pointed prolongation of somitic tissue, occupying
only the medial posterior quarter of the oblong area in question, and tapering off
here into a pointed anterior termination.

Such a negative, of course, in no way involves or supplies a demonstration of the
ganglionic character of the cellular material of the area in question.

The existence of a ganglionic lamina in the sub-ectodermal plane of the elongated
interval between the auditory region and that of the first somite, is rather difficult
to realise, unless recourse be had to study of the sections. The conception of the
existence of such a plate is slightly less difficult in the case of the right side of
