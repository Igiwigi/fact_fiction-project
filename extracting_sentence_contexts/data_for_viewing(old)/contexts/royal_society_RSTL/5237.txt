STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF BONE. ml

oval or circular outline, and that the walls of such canals have a tolerably uniform
surface. When examining sections of bone it is necessary to bear this fact in mind,
for on a close inspection it will be seen that there are other spaces which possess a
different character, although up to the present time, 80 far as the authors know, this
difference has not been recognized.

These spaces are irregular in shape, and have an irregular, festooned and often
jagged outline, similar to that found on the surface of bone which has been removed
by exfoliation, similar also to the surface left upon the fang of a tooth after a part has
been absorbed. Such spaces correspond in shape to the peripheral outline of one or
more of the Haversian systems, and are in fact subservient to the development, of
those systems, and necessarily precede their formation (Plate VI. figs. 2 a, 3 a, 4 a). It
is proposed to call these spaces which are produced by absorption, Haversian spaces,
as this name is indicative of their ultimate connection with the Haversian systems.
In the Haversian canals we have surrounding laminze, but in the spaces the boun-
daries are formed by portions of several systems, each of which has been in part
removed in the formation of the spaces, as shown in figures 2 and 3, and Plate V.,
which, on being compared with figure 1, will illustrate the difference between the
spaces and canals ; allowance must, however, be made for the difference of size, as
in figure 1 the parts are less magnified than in the other illustrations. In newly-
formed bone situated near ossifying cartilage, the Haversian spaces are exceedingly
numerous and large, frequently affording room for the development of two or more
systems (fig. 5, Plate VI. fig. 24, Plate VIII.), while in older bone they are far less
