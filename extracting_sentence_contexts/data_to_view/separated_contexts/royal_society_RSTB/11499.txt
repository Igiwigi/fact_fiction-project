However, such confidences
involve cognitive categorization of perception (where cognition
is the domain of thought and reasoning). One can be very con-
fident that one sees something, less confident that one sees a
person, still less confident that one sees a guy in a ill-fitting
suit and still less confident that one sees Isaac [6]. The fact that
conscious confidence depends on the imposition of cogni-
tive categories raises the question of the extent to which the
phenomenology of confidence is perceptual phenomenology. Morrison has countered by appealing to perceptual categor-
ization, saying it is the perceptual categories that make the
confidences perceptual [22]. However, it is not the case that
perceptual categorization is involved in all perception.
