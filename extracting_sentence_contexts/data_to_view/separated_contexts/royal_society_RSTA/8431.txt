From the values tabulated —y,/U
has been plotted in fig. 6, where the angular points are marked on theupper curve by
dots. In addition to the polygon the figure shows a smooth curve going through the
points, which would give an adequate representation of yz. It is, of course, necessary
that equation E (10) be satisfied for all values of M and not merely at a number of isolated
points, and the possibility of drawing a continuous curve devoid of rapid reversals
of slope has come to be recognised by us as an essential element of a satisfactory solution
on the lines now attempted.

The indication given by this solution that y’, becomes infinite at the edges of the
plate had not been anticipated, nor does lack of recognition of this fact appear to have
led to appreciable error in the case where & was equal to unity. On the other hand,
the attempted extension to & = 10,000 led to difficulties on this account, which will
now be dealt with. The result of proceeding as for k = 1, with a equal to
