Either of these suppositions is in harmony with the last point I wish to mentior
as suggestive of the far-reaching significance of aggregation, I mean its time relation
to the other events in the digestive cycle. Once aggregated, the most acti
bacteria move no more; when ingesta have attained to the stage of storage they ar
at the point of maximum shrinkage, and are at the same time ready for subsequen
solution. We find, in accordance with these facts, that the time elapsing between _
mgestion and aggregation is more nearly constant than any other period in the |
process of digestion, and that, on the other hand, the storing of ingesta may be ai
vigorous in character as it is varying in duration. I have counted one hundred
stored clusters of bacteria in one polype of Carchesium, and it has been mentione
above that no interval or an interval of many hours may be introduced between the
end of the movement of retrogression and the onset of solution.
