Since A is
found to oscillate with diminishing amplitude as Q increases. a higher degree of
accuracy is required in determining ’, ete., in order to obtain satisfactory approxima-
tion in A. For this reason the method becomes impracticable when Q and B are large, and the
range of our exploration is accordingly very limited. In fact, as fig. 1 makes clear, our
curves are confined in the main within a range of ReyNotps’ number which is less than
Orr’s figure (177) for the lowest value at which instability can possibly occur. Thus
we could have foretold that Q would be positive throughout the greater part of our
diagrams, and the actual determination of the loops has accordingly thrown little new
light on the question of stability or instability. Tt is clear that, when R has values such that instability can be contemplated, we must
