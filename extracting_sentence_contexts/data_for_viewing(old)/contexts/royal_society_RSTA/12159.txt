in the potential-energy W. When symbols of differentiation ave imagined for the
moment as separable from their operands, this term must be of the third degree in
dx, d/dy, d/dz) ; and it must be quadratic in (& y, @). It can therefore only involve
e rotation (f, g, 4) and its curl, each of them linearly ;* therefore, being a scalar,
e only form it can have is that of their scalar product; thus the term we are in

tquest of must be

This is in fact the term invented by MacCu..aau for the purpose of explaining the
otational phenomena of liquids, and of quartz in the direction of its optic axis, and

its curl, that is linear in both ; but probably in all uniaxial erystals, certainly in quartz,
he principal axes of this term are the same as the principal axes of optical elasticity of

On the Elasticity of the Primordial Medium.

37. The objection raised by Sir G. G. Sroxest in 1862 against the possibility of a
edium of the kind contemplated by MacCuLLacu’s energy-function, and since that
Stime generally admitted, is that an element of volume of such a medium when strained
Ss sould not be in equilibrium under the elastic tractions on its boundaries, but would
equire the application of an extraneous couple of amount proportional to its surface,
