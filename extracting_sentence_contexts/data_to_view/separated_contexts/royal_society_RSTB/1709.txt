that of a Cycad, while in Lyginodendron the presence of a pith and distinct bundles 5
create a certain similarity. The most interesting and remarkable point, however, which our investigations have
brought to light, is the fact that the vascular bundles in the stem of Lyginodendron
have exactly the same structure as those in the leaf of existing Cycads. This â€”
applies also to the leaf-traces and the bundles which form the outer part of the stele
in Heterangium. Both in our fossil genera and in Cycade the bundles in question
are collateral and mesarch, the primary xylem being chiefly centripetal, while a
smaller part is centrifugal.
