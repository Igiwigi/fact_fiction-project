low-probability realization of a random experiment. Getting the same number from a fair dice six
times in a row has very low probability. However, there is no special dynamical mechanism that
is associated with its occurrence. It is the result of pure randomness. Such rare events have to be
separated from the more special notion of extreme events, which, in the context of this work, will
be considered as rare realizations caused by the synergistic action of randomness and dynamical : =
instabilities. In particular, in our set-up, extreme events will be caused by finite-time instabilities 3
triggered by the effects of randomness and characterized by nonlinear energy transfers between
scales or modes. Finite-time instabilities refer to the case where a finite-time Lyapunov exponent nee)
of the system becomes positive but only for a finite-time interval [1]. In this sense, extreme :
events are a special case of rare events and therefore it is important to emphasize their special [4

1. The fact that there is a dynamical mechanism involved often increases substantially 1a
the intensity of extreme events compared with rare events caused by a purely random
process. This is manifested by the heavy tail characteristics of the corresponding
probability distribution.

2. Extreme events are usually associated with complex tails in the PDF. This complexity
reflects the fact that there is an underlying dynamical mechanism having the form of
nonlinear energy transfer, which may not act uniformly for all intensities of the extreme
event. For example, in an energy conserving system, such as nonlinear waves, although
instabilities can lead to extreme events, these cannot obtain arbitrarily large magnitudes
due to finite energy. Therefore, although nonlinearity can induce spatially localized
extremes, which are reflected as heavy-tailed regimes in the PDE, the latter have bounded
extent because of bounded energy. See figure 1b for an example.
