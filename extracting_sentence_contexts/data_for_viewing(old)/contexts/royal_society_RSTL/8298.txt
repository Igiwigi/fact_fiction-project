Number of siz-point conics through an avis.

We have now to determine B 80 that the equations (3'), (4'), (5), (6') may be simul-
taneously satisfied. We know already that B must lie on the cubic (4”); it is necessary
therefore to find some other locus on which it has to lie. First of all, then, we must
eliminate A between (3') and (5') and between (3') and (6') ; the results are,

(B*)(CY=(BY(CY*—(B*C)(B*(C)+(B*Y(C?) =p, say ;
(B*)(CY=(B*(CY'—(B*C)(B*N(C)+(B*Y(BC")=9,, 5ay.

Here p,=0 and g,=0 are curves touching the chief tangents at A, and of the degrees
four and five respectively. But the equations are not homogeneous; in fact only the
ratios and not the absolute values of the quantities @ were determined by the fixing of
the point A, and they may be regarded as involving an arbitrary factor whose square
affects the left-hand side of the equations. It is, however, at once eliminated, and we
obtain the homogeneous result,
(B*)- 95=(B) - Pe

This is a curve of order 7 having two branches in each of the chief directions at A. Of
its 21 intersections with the cubic (4), then, 12 coincide with A, and there remain nine
poxitions of B which give sextactic conics through the fixed axis ; or we may Say, of the
8extactic conics at the point A, there are nine whose planes pass through an arbitrary
point C.
