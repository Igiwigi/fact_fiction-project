In this aspect, polymer films will never be able to quite reach the same limits due to a lack of
crystallinity, the larger size of the polymer fibres and movement of the fibres during flexing. There is still however—to quote the now cliché from Richard Feynman—plenty of room at
the bottom [78]. The fact that a technique as simple as spin-coating can be used to produce
homogeneous films with values of rms surface roughness of less than 1nm [53] bodes well
for further miniaturization into the nano-regime. The solution processability means that very
large-scale integration (VSLI) is possible if applications are widely adopted. Providing that
whatever flexing required is consistent, the design, materials and fabrication protocols can be
optimized appropriately, allowing for further miniaturization.
