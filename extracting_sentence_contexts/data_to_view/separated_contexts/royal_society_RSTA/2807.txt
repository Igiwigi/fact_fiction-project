PascHEN gave it as 19859°9 with the remark
“Wahrscheinlich doppelt 1985679, 19864'6,” and he allotted 19864°6 to D,, and
19856°9 to the Principal series. But in [IL, p. 56] reasons were given against the
latter allocation. In fact the line is very close (probably within observation errors)
to the collateral formed by adding one oun to D,, The wave-length of such would
be 19857'8 = D,,(2)(+4) [see Note 2 at end]. Sr.
