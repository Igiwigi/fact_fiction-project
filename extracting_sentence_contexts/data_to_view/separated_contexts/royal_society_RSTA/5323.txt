The oscillatory processes associated with the coupling mechanisms
have been identified in earlier studies, and are related to endothelial [7-10], neurogenic [9,11,12]
and myogenic [13,14] activity. We measure the oscillatory functions of heart and respiration,
and then apply methods drawn from nonlinear science to detect their instantaneous phases and
frequencies. Once these have been established, we study the interaction between heart and
respiration, treating them as self-sustained nonlinear oscillators and investigating their mutual
coordination [15-17] or synchronization [18-26], coherence [27-32] and direction of coupling
[33-36], allowing for the fact that the characteristic frequencies, couplings and other interacting
characteristics vary in time [37,38]. We report below an analysis of the results obtained from a
study of 189 (99 male, 90 female) healthy subjects aged 16-90, enabling us to characterize the
changes with age that occur in the cardiorespiratory interaction. In ยง2, we present the methods of phase and frequency extraction used in the study, and we
show that the synchrosqueezed wavelet transform (SWT) [39] offers significant advantages.
