above given satisfied the required conditions very fairly, and although there were a
few minor details which could not be satisfactorily settled until the complete apparatus
had been fitted up, it was not found necessary to make any changes in the essential
features of the design. The three calorimeters ordered two years later by Dr. Barnes
were of the same design in all important points, except that two of them had 3 millims.
bore flow-tubes ; but these were found to be less suitable, and were employed in very
few of the tests.

(28.) Improvements in the Design of the Culorimeter,

Although Dr. Barnes was naturally unwilling to introduce any radical changes in
the original pattern, which had proved to be capable of giving very good results. there
can be no doubt that it was capable of improvement, and I had in fact already noted
several points in which alterations were desirable.

The importance of uniformity of bore in the flow-tube, and particularly in the out-
flow-tube, has already been referred to (§ 26). This was remedied in the later
apparatus. ‘T'wo of the side tubes were also removed, and the other two bent parallel
to the flow-tube, to facilitate insertion in the cylindrical form of jacket. These
modifications were of small importance, and were made in the first calorimeters after
the apparatus was received. A more important improvement in the same direction
would be to have the tube for exhausting the vacuum-jacket inserted at F, fig. 6, in a
direction paraliel to the flow-tube, which would permit the water-jacket to be made
much smaller, thus securing a more vigorous and uniform circulation,
