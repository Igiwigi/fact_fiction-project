or liquid-phase analytes into the gas phase. The gas-phase ions subsequently are transferred into 2 |
the mass analyser. The mass analyser sorts the ions—in space or time—according to the mass-

to-charge ratios (1/z). The separated ions are detected by an ion detector in the space or time 3
domain. Electric signals, produced by the ion detector, are subsequently processed to produce :8
mass spectra. In fact, mass spectra can be viewed as histograms, which provide information on ig
the number of ions at different m/z values. The detected ions may correspond to the original : a
molecules, their fragments or other species formed during the ionization process. MS enables :&
direct identification of molecules based on the mass-to-charge ratio as well as fragmentation {2

patterns. Thus, it fulfils the role of a qualitative analytical technique with high selectivity.

The twentieth century brought a number of milestone developments in the physical and
natural sciences, which are qualitative in their nature. Examples include: nuclear fission,
discovery of penicillin, elucidation of DNA structure, sequencing genomes or identification of :
numerous diseases. It also saw remarkable developments in the technologies enabling qualitative =
studies on the molecular level. Instrumental techniques such as scanning tunnelling microscopy, 3
confocal microscopy, capillary electrophoresis or nuclear resonance spectrometry had enabling
