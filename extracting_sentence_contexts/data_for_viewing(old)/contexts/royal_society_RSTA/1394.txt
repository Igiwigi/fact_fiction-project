as follows: DAGAN, ReconGAN and RefineGAN are three typical single-domain networks, while
KIGAN is a novel representative cross-domain network. More importantly, all four methods have
open-source implementations, which have been widely validated on various MRI datasets, and
therefore ensured the robustness and reproducibility.

For the brain and knee datasets, KIGAN has underperformed ReconGAN and RefineGAN.

However, as for the liver dataset, the differences between KIGAN and RefineGAN has not been : 3

RefineGAN has converged slowly but has demonstrated the best results. We analysed the size : =

U-Net based, consisting of an encoder and a decoder with several down-sample and up-sample : 4
units. Thus, the size of generators mainly depends on the depth of encoder and decoder, the De
implementation details of down/up-sample units, and the basic width, i.e. the number of feature : s
maps in the first level. In particular, the parameters of each model are as follows: DAGAN : Ss

parameters and KIGAN has 3121281 parameters. Thus, we speculated that the RefineGAN
