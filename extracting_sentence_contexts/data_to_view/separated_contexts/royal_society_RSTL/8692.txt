The resistance with india-rubber is very con-
siderable; my experiments show it to be ten times as great as with iron. I am not
aware that this fact has been previously recognized ; and that it has often been over-
looked is proved by the numerous attempts which have been made to use india-rubber
tires for wheels, the invariable failure of which may, I think, in the absence of any
other assigned cause, be fairly attributed to the excessive resistance which attends their
use. Another fact which I do not think has been hitherto noticed, but of which I have
had ample evidence, and which clearly shows the existence of some hitherto unexplained
MDCCCLAXYI. Y
