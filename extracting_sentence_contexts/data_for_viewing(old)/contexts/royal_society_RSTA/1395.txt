The choice of the iteration is a challenging task. As can be seen from figure 4 the algorithms
can have different CoV at the same iteration so it would be fair to compare the algorithms at the
same noise level. The analysis was first carried out by selecting the iteration in a way that all
methods were compared at similar CoV for each patient. Nevertheless, such a procedure would
need to be repeated for every patient and in a clinical environment it would not be possible to look
at the different performance for each iteration since the vendor software only saves the chosen
iteration image. For this reason, all the information was saved for 10 iterations and the iteration
with the highest number of true positives was selected for every algorithm. The selected iteration
was the 4th for HKEM and KEM and the 3rd for OSEM+G. The outcomes of these two different
choices of iteration were the same. From the same figure, it can be noted that the TBRmax value
keeps increasing iteration after iteration and the algorithms do not reach a plateau within 10 full
iterations. This is consistent with all the patients, and is due to the fact that the analysis is based
on the voxel with the maximum value.

The visual comparison in figure 5, for three patients, shows how HKEM is able to provide
well-defined lesions in the aneurysm compared to the other two algorithms. KEM also shows
improved definition and higher contrast over OSEM+G. Although only three patient images


are reported, these results were consistent among all the patient datasets. These results give
confirmation of what was previously demonstrated in other work [9,24] but on a larger
scale.

Almost all the positive patients in the test dataset, 96% for HKEM, 94% for KEM and 76% for
