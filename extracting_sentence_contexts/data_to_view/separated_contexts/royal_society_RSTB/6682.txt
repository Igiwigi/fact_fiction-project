Salaman (1936, 1937@) has shown that a protection against the potato
virus Y may be obtained by prior infection with an attenuated stock of the
same. The conclusions here presented on protective inoculation have been derived from
experiments in which many thousands of plants have been used and in which each
observation has been repeated scores of times. This superfluity of experimentation is to
be explained by the fact that as soon as the principle was firmly established, the writer
and his colleagues made use of the phenomenon as a routine method for testing for the
presence of non-virulent X strains in the potato or other plant under investigation, as
well as for replacing a severe strain by a mild one in any given mixture of viruses which
can be communicated by sap inoculation or graft. A further use was made in Cam-
bridge of the reaction as a criterion for the assignment of any given virus to the X
group. In all these respects it has proved of very real value.
