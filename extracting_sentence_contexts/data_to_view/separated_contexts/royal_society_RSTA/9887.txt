Further, since the amount of relative retardation as given by (7) involves only the
relative heights of the axes of the slabs and the source of light, the latter may be
moved parallel to the axes of the slabs without affecting the relative retardation. Hence a horizontal line-source, parallel to the axes of the slabs, may be used instead
of a point-source. This was, in fact, indispensable in order to obtain the required
intensity.

ยง 3. Description of the Apparatus. Light from an are lamp L was passed through a condensing lens C and through a
thin horizontal slit T (fig. 2), which was placed from 24 to 3 metres away from the
