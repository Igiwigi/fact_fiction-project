by parting gave evidence of the presence of silver. Two specimens of indium were
examined : they both yielded the flame spectrum and the reactions usual with this
metal ; one of them showed no strong lines in the ultra-violet which could not be
attributed to tin, lead, or cadmium ; the other contained tin and cadmium in such
Proportions that the lines of these metals were more prominent than those of indium,
A third specimen, prepared by Professor Ricnres, of Freiberg, yielded no spectral
lines which could be attributed to any foreign metal,

50 PROFESSOR W. N. HARTLEY ON SPECTRUM PHOTOGRAPHY

A 8triking fact was noticed which, as will be een, is exemplified in the case of

magnesium, namely, that it is not always what appears to be the strongest and
longest lines which first make their appearance when an impurity is discernible ; and
it was considered that many observations were necessary to ascertain which are the
most persistent lines in the spectra of the elements. Ib was proposed to extend these
observations, but their importance at thab time did not seem to be appreciated.
Almost all varieties of spark spectra have since been investigated, with the object of
applying spectrum photography to the purposes of chemical analysis. From time to
time opportunities have occurred when the process which has been gradually developed
and rendered practical has been advantageously put into operation for the solution of
questions upon which it would have been difficult to arrive ab a decision by other
means. For instance, T employed photographs of spark spectra in an examination
