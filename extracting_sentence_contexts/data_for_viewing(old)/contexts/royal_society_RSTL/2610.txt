298 DR. TURNER ON CHLORIDE OF BARIUM.

methods, owing to a trace of the chloride being dissolyed by the strong acid
s0lution.

It may be inferred, as a mean of the four first experiments, that 100 parts
of silver correspond to 132.83 parts of chloride of silyer. The proportion
stated by BgRzELIvs is 100 to 132.75; and it is estimated at 100 to 132.72 by
Dr. Tromson. All these results, therefore, are closely correspondent.

From one of the experiments (No. 4.) just mentioned, it is manifest that the
precipitation of chloride of barium by nitrate of silyer does not involve any
appreciable source of error. To be quite certain, however, as to this fact,
chloride of barium was mixed with nitrate of silver in excess, and the precipi-
tate carefully washed. It was then boiled in distilled water, and the fluid ex-
amined for silyer and baryta ; but not a trace of either could be detected. It
dissolved completely in ammonia, and the addition of sulphuric acid did not
cause the slightest turbidity.

In five analyses made by precipitating chloride of barium by an excess of
nitrate of silver, I obtained the following proportions.

Chloride of Barium. Chloride of Silver.
