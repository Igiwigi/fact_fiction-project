Now as the number
of children increases with advancing age, the force of the moral factor increases also
with the age. Thus passing from younger couples to older ones, we pass at the same
time from small to large families, that is from those where the wish for offspring is
greater to those in which it is less, where consequently the influence of the moral
factor is preponderant over the physiological one. It is to this preponderance that
we must attribute the fact that the probability of birth diminishes so rapidly and so
regularly with the advancing age. I shall prove in the following, statistically, that by eliminating the influence of the
moral factor, we find fertility distributed in a much more uniform manner over life,
But let us first of all recognize the course which the curve follows under the
influence of both factors. Though this curve does not represent the course of natural
law, it furnishes notwithstanding a picture of the actual state of legitimate fertility,
and thus of the chief condition of the multiplication of mankind.
