(3.) The Fish has no power of varying the capacity of its air-bladder by direct
muscular contraction, and its readjustment to a new plane of least effort results from
a gradual increase or (leerense in the amount und volowe of the contained air to an
extent proportional to the new pressore, and due to « corresponding modification of
the processes concerted in the seeretion or absorption of gas into or from the aie
Iladder, Hence, by this apparently automatic method of adjuatment the Fish will
find, sooner or later, and whatever the depth of the water and the amomét of external
hydrostatic and atmospheric pressure, a plane of least effort where it will again
possess exactly the density of the water.

bladder has no foundation in fact,

The conclusions embodied in the preceding sections relate more particularly to the
Physoclisti—by far the largest group of Teleostean Vishes—but it may be pointed
out that in a general way they apply also to the Physostomi with, however, the
qualification that in the great majority of the latter group the mechanical liberation
of gas through the ductus pneumaticus takes the place of absorption as a means of
adjustment to reduced pressures.

Although an air-bladder is unquestionably un advantage to the generality of Teleos-
teau Fishes, there can be no doubt that its presence i also attended by vertain
(lisudvantages which to a greater or less extent limit and control the lovomotor
activities of its possessor, and that of these the most important is the restriction
