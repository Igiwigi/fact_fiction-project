Safety and environment

DEMO and the future Fusion Power Plants are nuclear devices. This implies that safety is an issue
in all sub-projects from the first day of conceptual design onwards. Despite the fact that a fusion
reactor is inherently safe, everything possible should be done to protect the workers and the
people living in the environment from any risk. To obtain a license to operate the device it must be
demonstrated to the nuclear regulator that all aspects of the reactor are safe and that there are no
hidden pitfalls [26]. Having the present negative public opinion in mind about the employment
of nuclear fission plants it is important to convince society that the risks associated with the
operation of a fusion plant (e.g. the handling of tritium, the handling of short-lived nuclear waste,
etc.) are well under control.
