Nitrite of Amyl.—On Sarsia the effect of this agent is much the same as that
of chloroform—the description just given in < 1 being quite as applicable to the effects
of the nitrite as to those of chloroform. Before the loss of spontaneity supervenes, the
rate of the rhythm is increased, while the strength of the pulsations is diminished. Tiaropsis diademata, from the fact of its presenting a very regular rhythm and being
but of small size, is a particularly sitable species upon which to conduct many experi-
ments relating to the effects of poisons. On this species the nitrite in appropriate (4. e.
in very 8mall) doses first causes irregularity and enfeeblement of the contractions,
together with quickening of the rhythm. After a short time, a gradual cessation of the
s8wimming-motions becomes apparent—these motions dying out more gradually, for
example, than they do under the influence of chloroform, Eventually each pulsation is
marked only by a slight contraction of the muscular tissue in the immediate neighbour-
hood of the margin, If the dose has been stronger, however, well-marked spasmodic
contractions come on and obliterate such gradual working of the poison.
