and experimental studies have found that relatively fast growth
is associated with higher levels of oxidative stress markers in
both laboratory and field studies [61,96,97], and a recent
meta-analysis has demonstrated that there is good evidence
that faster growth incurs increased oxidative damage, and
that this may constrain growth strategies [98]. The context in
which growth takes place will therefore be expected to influ-
ence the level of oxidative stress that occurs. Thus body size,
growth rate and environmental conditions are likely to
matter in the context of telomere dynamics, and we consider
these further below.

An additional complexity is brought by the fact that the pat-
tern of growth can vary considerably among taxa, most notably
between determinate and indeterminate growers which relates
to the degree of genetic determination of growth [99]. The typi-
cal growth pattern of determinate growers involves growth to
an asymptote with limited environmental input to final size
[99]. Indeterminate growth generally involves a high environ-
mental input, and considerable variation in body size, and in
many cases growth throughout life. The life history of determi-
nate growers, such as birds and most mammals, is that growth
toa final body size takes place relatively early in life and prior to
sexual maturity, after which relatively little growth takes place.
There are important differences among the typical avian and
