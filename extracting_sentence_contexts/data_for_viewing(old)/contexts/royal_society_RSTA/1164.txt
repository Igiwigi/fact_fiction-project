Then o(T) < —(pC)“}.

Note that the existence of constants C such that (2.8) and (2.9) hold would already follow from
the fact that all orbits (or weak orbits) of (T(é));>0 lie in an L?-space, by a simple application of the
closed graph theorem. Observe also that the estimate w(T) < —(pC)-! is optimal in the sense that
«(T) equals the infimum of the numbers —(pC)"1, with C > 0 running over all constants for which
(2.8) holds with respect to an equivalent norm; see [3, p. 82].

For other results of this type and relevant ideas, we refer the reader to [1], [3, Ch. 3], and to
[47]. There are many more statements along the lines of Theorem 2.5 in the literature (although
most of them are primarily of theoretical interest).

While there are many perturbation results for the exponential stability, most of them concern
perturbations which are small in a metric sense; in this case exponential stability of the perturbed
semigroup comes as no surprise. However, there are some nice exceptions of this rule, as the
following recent result by Priiss [48] shows.
