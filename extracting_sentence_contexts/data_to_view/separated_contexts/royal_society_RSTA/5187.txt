In a certain range of :3
exponents, we prove that the diameter of the support of the discrete minimizers does not depend :
on the number of Dirac deltas. This result, together with standard compactness arguments, results
in our desired global minimizers among probability measures. In fact, our strategy to show the confinement of discrete minimizers is in the same spirit as the
proof of the confinement of solutions of the aggregation equation in [37,38]. In our case, the ideas
behind the proof in ยง2 are based on convexity-type arguments in the range of exponents y > a > 1 :
to show the uniform bound in the diameter of global minimizers in the discrete setting. Section 3 =
is devoted to more refined results in one dimension.
