26, pp. 293-299, 1917), published since this paper was written, Miss VAN VLEUTEN has analyzed and
discussed the solar diurnal magnetic variations, in order to test the theory developed by Prof. ScuusTER
in his two memoirs. The conclusions arrived at are (a) that “the forces causing the diurnal variation,
taken as a whole, do not possess a potential, although it remains always possible to deduce part of these
forces from a potential,” and ()) that “the cause of the diurnal variation certainly cannot be ascribed to
nothing else but a system of currents exterior to the earth and currents within the earth induced by the
former system.”

These conclusions appear to rest mainly on the non-correspondence of the observed North force
variations with those calculated from the simple potential representation of the West force variations
(ef. §9). But their physical implication is that electric currents traversing the earth’s surface have an
important share in producing the diurnal magnetic variations. This seems extremely improbable, and,
instead of (a) and ()), the interpretation of the above fact of observation seems rather to be merely that
the diurnal variations are somewhat complicated, so that their potential cannot be represented exactly
by any simple combination of spherical harmonics. There are physical grounds for such a conclusion ; in
a paper recently communicated to the Cambridge Philosophical Society I have given reasons for
supposing that two distinct agencies and atmospheric layers are involved in the production of the diurnal
magnetic variations.

While the magnetic variation field does not give simple results on the application of spherical harmonic
analysis, the latter is still the only convenient means which mathematics affords for discussing the relation
between the external and internal current systems, and between the former and the atmospheric circulations
indicated by the barometer. I do not think that on these points the main results obtained in the present
paper are likely to be modified seriously upon further investigation, but that, especially when the parts
of the diurnal variations, due to the two agencies above mentioned, are separated and independently
