such remarkable exactness in the London tides; that is, the ordinate of the curve
has in the course of a fortnight a minimum and a maximum magnitude, 80 that the
curve assumes the form 7. Moreover, it is not symmetrical on the two sides of the
minimum and maximum, the slope being greater after the minimum than before it.
The curye descends from the 7th to about the 13th of June; it then ascends till the
18th or 19th, and ascends more rapidly than it had descended, and then descends
again less rapidly. All this agrees with the form given by theory.

4. But though the general course of the curves has this resemblance, the amount
of flexure is not the same at different places. This result had already been obtained
by the comparison of previous obseryations, especially those made at Brest, Ply-
mouth, and London; it is confirmed s0 clearly by the observations here referred to,
that I think it may now be assumed to be a general fact.

The inferences from this Å¿act are very important ; for in the first place it puts an
end to all attempts to deduce the mass of the moon from the phenomena of tides, or
to correct the tables of the tides by means of the mass of the moon. The approximate
agreement of the mass of the moon deduced by LarLace from the tides of Brest, with
the mass obtained from other phenomena, cannot be considered as otherwise than
accidental. If he had employed the tides of London, he would have obtained a mass
very different, as Mr. LuBBock has shown; if he had taken those of Plymouth, or of
Brighton, the mass would have been again very different.

This evidence of the inapplicability of this part of the theory will not surprise any
one who recollects how remote the hypotheses of the theory are from the case of
