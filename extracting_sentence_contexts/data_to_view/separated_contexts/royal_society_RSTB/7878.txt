The two ovaries of this animal
together weighed about 20 g, as compared with 80g, the approximate weight (from
preservative) of the ovaries of the foetus of E84. As the photographs show, the reduction
is mainly accounted for by the regression of the interstitial cells from their hypertrophied
condition. The interstitial tissue is still conspicuous, however, and in fact up to this
stage its regression has for the most part consisted of a reduction in the size of the
individual cells. The ovaries of the second calf, E119, are similar in size and in general
appearance to those of E134, but the interstitial tissue has changed considerably in character. The cells are somewhat dispersed and the cytoplasm shows a greater degree of vacuolation.
