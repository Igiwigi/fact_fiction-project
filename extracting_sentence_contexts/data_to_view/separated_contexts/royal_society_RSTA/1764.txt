computation domain the size of the computation domain truncates the modelling space. In
fact, the fringing electric field extends to infinity, but drops off in
proportion to the inverse cube of the distance. They rapidly become
small enough to be considered numerically insignificant. Here, it is
verified that the computation domain is large enough to capture

the fringing fields
