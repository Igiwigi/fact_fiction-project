actual terminations.

They generally disappear among the fibres of the intra-ganglionic plexus and
probably end in relation to a ganglionic cell. Doren, however, describes these axones
as running out to terminate in the muscle coats, and accordingly suggests that these
cells represent the motor cells of the myenteric ganglia. I have never been able to
trace axones of these cells into the musculature, nor, indeed, outside the meshes of the
myenteric plexus, so that I find it difficult to accept Doarer’s suggestion. Moreover,
it has to be remembered that cells of this type do not occur in the sub-mucous plexus,
and that the endings of the extrinsic fibres (i.e., those conveying impulses to the gut),
as I shall show later, are only found on cells of Type II.

These facts demonstrate that the function of the cells in question is not motor, and

I suggest from the disposition of their processes that they are associative. On the one
hand, they are capable of receiving impulses by way of their dendrites, which form
receptive terminations on cells of Type IL; and, on the other, they can transmit
impulses through their axones to neurones of Type IT situated in other ganglia.

Cells of Doaren’s Type II are most easily studied in methylene blue preparations,
