12 subject was made by the wool-staplers of Elbceuf in France. They were accustomed to
= receive dirty fleeces from Brazil, and among other matters entangled in the wool were the
S seeds of a certain plant called Medicago. It had been repeatedly found by the wook cleaners
> that these seeds sometimes germinated after a period of four hours' boiling. 'The late M.
= Povcner repeated the experiment. He collected the seeds, boiled them for four hours,
S and 8owed them afterwards in proper earth. 'To his astonishment they proved fruitful.
E He then closely examined the boiled seeds, and found the great majority of them
EZ swollen and disorganized; but amongst these ruined secds he observed others which
[= had refused to imbibe the water or to swell or break up in any way. These he care-
£ fully picked out, and sowed them and their neighbours separately in the same kind of
65 earth. The swollen seeds were incapable of germination, while the unaltered ones
'S rapidly gave birth to a crop. This was the only instance of such resistance known to
bj Povener when he communicated the fact to the Paris Academy of Sciences.
= The observation here described stands recorded in the © Comptes Rendus” for 1866,

vol. Ixiii. p. 939, and it subverts the arguments founded by Dr. BasTiaN on the par-
ticular cases which he has adduced. 1t is not difficult, indeed, to see that the surface
of a 8eed or germ may be 80 affected by desiccation and other causes as practically to
j! prevent contact between it and a surrounding liquid F. The body of a germ, moreover,
may be 80 indurated by time and dryness as to resist powerfully the insinuation of water
