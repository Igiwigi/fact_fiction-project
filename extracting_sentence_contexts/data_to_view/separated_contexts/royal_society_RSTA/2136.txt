Days
subsequent to n-+-15 would, in the above hypothetical case, come from the next
month. They, too, up to day m +- 24, will have to provide a deficiency, helping to make
up for the secondary positive pulse. Thus the facts that the portion of curve from
day n +- 3 to day n + 23, connecting the primary and secondary pulses, falls below the
normal, and that the deficiency is greater for the portion of curve immediately following
the primary pulse, are quite in accordance with anticipations. Similar reasoning leads
us to anticipate that the portion of curve connecting the primary and secondary
negative pulses will lie above the normal, throughout at least the greater part of its
course,

But the aggregate deficiency in the primary negative pulse is substantially less than
the corresponding excess in the primary positive pulse, being only 1,144, as against
1,477 units. Thus, a priori, we should have expected that from day + 3 to day n + 23, the curve
from, the associated Q days would have lain nearer the normal than the curve from the
associated D days.
