In Halysceptrum, the development of which has been examined by K6ttker, the
eight mesenteries appear from the very first. In Kalliphobe (Buscn), one of the
Edwardsic, according to MEgTsCHNIKOPP, the larva has, in its earliest stage, eight
tentacles and two mesenterial filaments.

The peculiarities presented by the Stylasteridze have struck many observers. M.-Ep-
warps and Ham placed these corals (Stylasteracea) under the Oculinide. Grar,
however, established a family (Stylasteridz) for the genus Stylaster alone. Povrratis,
who in his *Deep-Sea Corals' dwells upon the many peculiarities of the corallum of
this family, places under it the genera Allopora, Stylaster, Distichopora, Cryptohelia *,
Lepidopora, and Errina, The peculiarities in the structure of the soft parts, and the
relations of the tentacles to the septa, described in this paper as occurring in a Stylaster
and a Cryptohelia, and the similar facts observed by Sas in the genus Allopora, strengthen
the facts brought forward by PourraLts, with regard to the coralla, in a very potent
manner. I hope to make a elose study of the structure of Stylaster. 'The apparent
absence of mesenteries is most remarkable, and a similar condition appears to occur
also in Millepora. The number of tentacles and septa in the Stylasteride seems hardly
to follow the usual hexameral law. In the species of Stylaster examined by me there
are invariably twenty-two septa and twenty-two tentacles. In Stylaster erubescens,
PovRTALEs describes the septa as being in number from nine to twelve, most frequently
eleven. In Allopora miniata the septa are from seyen to ten, generally eight. Cryp-
tohelia has commonly sixteen.

With regard to the affinities of the Milleporide, no certain conclusion can be arrived
at from the few facts yet ascertained. I hope to obtain specimens at Hawaii in sexually
