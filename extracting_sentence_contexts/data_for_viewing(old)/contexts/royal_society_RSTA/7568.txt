In the absence of Calgon fresh nucleation began within 30 min. of beginning addition
of the reagents to the seed grains and water. Some of the nuclei continued to grow but most
of them left the crystallizer in the overflow. The solids from the crystallizer after the 21 hr.
run are illustrated in figure 3. The seed grains grew but little; in fact only about 20 % of
the growth occurred on the grains. If, however, traces of Calgon were included in either
reagent solution (it was normally added to the sodium carbonate solution) nucleation
began at a later stage in the run and a greater proportion of the growth was on the seed
grains. Thus when Calgon was present at a concentration of 6 p.p.m. in the sodium
carbonate solution, nucleation only occurred some hours after reagent addition had begun
and even these nuclei had grown considerably at the close of the experiment. When the
Calgon addition was about 9 p.p.m. there was no nucleation at all; the solution in the
crystallizing vessel remained quite clear and all the growth was on the grains (figure 4,
plate 1).

The presence of still larger amounts of Calgon in the solution from which calcium
carbonate was being formed produced different effects on the mode of growth. Thus
