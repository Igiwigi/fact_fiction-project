No statistical estimate of the accuracy of curves for purposes of comparison can be made
in the absence of strictly parallel plots. It may, however, be confidently anticipated
that random errors of this kind are, if anything, of a smaller order than the differences
between the curves obtained for plots 7, 13 and (17 and 18) ammonium series.

Reality of Slow Changes.

The prediction formule which we have obtained are entirely independent of the slow
changes which appear to have taken place in yield and in weather. In presenting the
evidence for slow changes in yield (5) it was presumed, in the absence of a full investigation
of the sequence of rainfall records, that favourable and unfavourable weather conditions
fluctuated independently from year to year ; in fact, that slow changes were absent from
the meteorological series. We now know that a small percentage of the variance of
annual rainfall should probably be ascribed to slow changes, and that sequences of wet
years did in fact occur about 1879 and 1914. Since these two periods agree with the
two main depressions in yield, it becomes at first sight questionable whether the slow
changes in yield may not after all be ascribable to meteorological effects.

* This question is most readily answered by calculating the actual depression in yield
ascribable to the additional rainfall in the two rainy periods. Plot 2B is most suitable
for a comparison for the residual variance is, in comparison to the yield, very small
in this plot, and the prediction formula correspondingly accurate. The yield in any
year is regarded as made of two parts, part (positive or negative) is due to the rainfall
sequence under which the crop was grown, the remainder is the yield handicapped for
