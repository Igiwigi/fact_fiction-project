The anisotropy of the cell-walls, as regards their mechanical properties, is more
striking in connection with the different behaviour in tension and compression. It is
well known that the strength of wood is much greater in longitudinal tension than
in end-compression. The different microscopical characters of the fractures can be
correlated with this difference. It has been seen that increasing stress in end-
compression leads to the development of increasing numbers of slip-planes in the
substance of the walls, but that actual rupture rarely, if ever, oceurs along these,
failure being finally manifested by buckling and crinkling of the fibres. In tension
there is a greater resistance to the development of slip-planes, and very few of these
appear, but slipping along them is followed by rupture almost immediately. The
microscopic facts, therefore, indicate that the gradual plastic yielding of the substance
of the cell-walls, which occurs in compression, does not take place to anything like
the same extent in tension, The fact that, in Spruce, after the initial ruptures have
occurred in tension, the rest of the material fails by longitudinal shearing, does not
affect this conclusion. If the substance of the cell-walls were isotropic, it seems

reasonable to suppose plastic yielding would be manifested both in tension and
compression in a similar manner.

In tension the inclination of the planes of slipping differs for different woods, but
