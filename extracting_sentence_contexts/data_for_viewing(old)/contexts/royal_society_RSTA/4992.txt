Proof. (1) For all ack, , the components of x (resp. @) can be recovered from the sheaf

[xa]*Hyp(x,@) as the tame characters occurring in the representation of the inertia group at 0

(resp. at 00) corresponding to this sheaf, and the multiplicity appears as the size of the associated

Jordan block (see [17, Theorem 8.4.2 (6), (7), (8)]). Thus, (3.1) is only possible if x; ~ x2 and @; ~ a2.
We assume this is the case now, i.e. that

[xa] Hyp(x, a) = Hyp (x, @)-

We then obtain a = 1 from [17, Lemma 8.5.4] and the fact that the Euler—-Poincaré characteristic
of a hypergeometric sheaf is —1.

(2) We may assume that 1 > m, using inversion otherwise. Assume that y € PGL)(Fp) is such
that

y*Hyp(x,@) = Hyp(x,@) @&

for a rank 1 sheaf £. By comparing ramification behaviour, we see that y must be diagonal (if

y—1(0) #0, then £ must be tamely ramified at 0 to have the tensor product tamely ramified at

y~}(0), as y*Hyp(x, @) is; but then the inertia invariants at y~1(0) are zero for the tensor product, a
