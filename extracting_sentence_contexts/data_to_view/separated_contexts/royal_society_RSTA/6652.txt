The standard tables (tables 2, 3) give ¢ or cos¢ as a function of 0 for given hf, and in
carrying out integrations using the forms (3-5) or (3-6), direct or inverse interpolation is
necessary in drawing up the requisite tables of cos¢ as a function of cos@ or of cos@ as a
function of cos ¢. Since the intervals are small, however, once the first few entries have been
obtained by the method indicated above, subsequent estimates may be readily made with
considerable accuracy by forward extrapolation using the part of the table already con-
structed. It will be apparent that the labour entailed in computing the integrals corresponding to
the mean magnetization for ellipsoids orientated at random for the four 4 values from
—0-6 to —0-9 (table 6, § 4) is quite formidable, even allowing for the fact that the integrals
for the corresponding positive values of h are obtained incidentally. It must be stressed,
however, that a procedure similar to that outlined is necessary if uncertainties are to be
avoided. Even if an accuracy of 0-001 rather than of 0-0001 in cos¢ had been aimed at, it
is doubtful whether a direct attack on the integrals (using the form (3-4) exclusively) would
have been satisfactory.
