We are, therefore, driven to the use of theory in order to present our facts
in an intelligible order. When we talk, then, of seeking the evolutionary aim of a
group, we are only attempting by further theory to make our facts more intelligible. Now, generally speaking, in the Cretaceous Cheilostomes, the facts are as follows. The skeletal (presumably originally caleareous) parts of the organisms with which
we are dealing can be arranged in numerous lines (lineages) diverging from com-
paratively fewer forms. These radical forms are simpler, that is, there is less skeletal
matter and less elaboration of structure, and they are connected, more or less
gradually, by intermediate stages along the lineages with the ultimate forms that
have more skeletal matter and more elaboration of structure.
