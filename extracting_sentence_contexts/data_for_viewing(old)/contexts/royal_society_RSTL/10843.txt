Effects of Vibration on. Induced and Residual Magnetism in Tron.

$ 48. It is well known that mechanical disturbance makes iron take up more
magnetism under an inducing force than it would take up if undisturbed, and that,
after the withdrawal of an inducing force mechanical disturbance reduces the residual
magnetism. I was, however, unprepared to find these effects exhibit themselves 0 -
markedly as they did in certain specimens of annealed iron.

It has -been already mentioned ($ 14) that after an annealed wire of oft iron had
been magnetised, and the magnetising force removed, gentle tapping had the effect of
almost completely removing the residual magnetism, great as that was. In fact, in
dealing with very sofb annealed iron, I generally found mechanical vibration—produced
by gently beating against the table—to be the mosb convenient way of restoring the
wire under tes to its original neutral condition after magnetisation. The residual
magnetism of soft iron is 80 sensitive to disturbance that in experiments made with
the view of observing the retentiveness of the metal, the utmost care must be used
to avoid accidental errors due to this cause. For example, a long rod of oft iron, to
which a magnetising force had been applied and withdrawn, leaving about 90 per
cent. of the induced magnetism as residual, was lying on a table in the laboratory, an
induction coil round the rod being in cireuit with a ballistic galvyanometer. A person
walking quickly along a neighbouring corridor caused by each footstep a distinet
transient current in the galvanometer, due to the shaking out of successive parts of
the rod's residual magnetisgm. The lightest tap or even rub by the fingers made the
