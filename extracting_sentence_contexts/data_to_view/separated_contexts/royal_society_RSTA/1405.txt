Previous works by Foster
and colleagues have used AFM force mapping, nanoindentation and lateral force modulation
to understand film morphology and heterogeneities [45,47,55-57], humidity [58] and ageing
[46,57] on the adhesive properties of PSA films. However, while some of these works mention
the potential to correlate the nano-adhesion of model PSAs to their ‘bulk’ tack, and peel and
shear strengths, no direct comparisons to these specific metrics have been made [59-61]. In fact,
most other nano-adhesion studies of PSAs also focus solely on their properties at the nanoscale
[38,62,63] or compare them to other bulk properties such as the rheological behaviour of the latex
[64]. Furthermore, Phillips et al. [61] reported the only other account where, to our knowledge,
nanoparticle reinforced latexes were investigated using nano-adhesion measurements. Shown here is the potential to use AFM as a tool to optimize latex-based PSA formulations
to produce PSAs with performance comparable to or exceeding that of their solution-based
counterparts.
