Some form of composition-
Author for correspondence: ality is supposed to explain concomitant cognitive capacities, such as the

systematicity of language [1] and thought [2], i.e. where possessing certain cogni-
tive capacities implies possessing certain other (structurally related) cognitive
capacities—an equivalence relation on cognitive abilities [3]—such as under-
standing the meaning of John loves Mary and Mary loves John. Classical
compositionality, for example, supposedly explains systematicity by appealing
to a combinatorial syntax and semantics, i.e. semantic relations between constituent
entities are captured by syntactic relations between corresponding symbols, and
cognitive processes that are sensitive to those syntactic/semantic relations [4]. So, to illustrate, the meaning of John loves Mary is captured by a symbol, JOHN,
for the person John, a symbol, MARY, for the person Mary, and a symbol,
LOVES, for the relation loves that are combined (juxtaposed) in a way that
expresses the fact that John is the lover and Mary is the one loved, e.g. LOVES
(JOHN, MARY). Classical compositionality can account for systematicity by
assuming that structurally related capacities involve the same combinatorial syn-
tactic process [4], e.g. lover is determined by the first argument position.
