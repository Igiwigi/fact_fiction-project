In potato plants suffering from interveinal necrosis in the field only the X% strain
has been found, though when a stock is carried on by tuber in the glasshouse it is not
rare to find that in subsequent years in one or other plant of a clone a more or less
complete clinical recovery has taken place. In such a case only X¢ may be found. It
would, however, be quite unjustifiable to assert that the X” was in fact unmixed at the
start without more careful analysis. The virulence of X* is so far in excess of that of
X*, X¢ and still more of X”, that even were such to be present, they would need to be
in very considerable concentration before their presence would be detected. If for
some reason X* died out, then another strain, even if present in the smallest quantity,
would have a chance of overrunning the plant.
