Hence I, = 0°24. 10-7 approximately. Thus if the density-ratio of the two gases is changing by 1 per cent. per second, the
difference of temperature, if they are equally mixed (7.¢., A, =A, = #), is approxi-
mately one thousand-millionth of a degree centigrade.* The hotter gas is the
one which is diminishing in relative concentration. In fact, we may perhaps regard
the slightly excess speed of the molecules of this gas as the cause of its relative
expansion and consequent rarefaction. It is clear from these figures, however, that
the phenomenonis likely to be of very minute dimensions in ordinary cases.

* Thus To = A:49(T;—Ts) = 4(T,—Ts) = —0°24,1077 Be = -0°24,107%, so that T;-T; = -10-°

approximately. Note A. (To p. 118, line 3.)

[Since this paper was communicated to the Royal Society, this part of the theory has been
experimentally tested and confirmed, at least qualitatively.
