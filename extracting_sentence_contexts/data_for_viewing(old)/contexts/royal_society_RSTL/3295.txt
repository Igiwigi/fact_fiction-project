here afforded, the two theories of the transportation of erratic boulders, which are
alone worthy of consideration, namely, that of great debacles and of floating ice. I
will not lay any stress on the difficulty of imagining, in accordance with the first
theory, a rush of water s0 impetuous as to transport vast masses of rock across pro-
found valleys and up the steep sides of high mountains, for this difficulty has no
special reference to the case of Lochaber; but those who believe in the past oc-
currence of 80 terrific an agitation of the waters of a deep sea, must, in 80me manner
account for the frequency of boulders in the most exposed places on the Summits of
hillocks, and likewise for 80 many having been left in narrow straits, where one would
have anticipated the most impetuous rush of water. On the face of Tombhran I ob-
served many boulders scattered on the shelves, which have been formed there not

* This is a similar fact to what has been observed on the Jura, Sir Janzs Har (Edinburgh Royal Trans-
actions, vol. vii. p. 143.) «ays it is principally where the snowy summits are visible from the face of the Jura
by means of some depression in the intervening hills, that we find these travelled masses.”

only by the accumulation of loose matter, but also by the deep excision of the solid
underlying rock. Again, there were other boulders on the shelves on the rocky pen-
insula near the junction of Upper and Lower Glen Roy, where much of the gneiss
has been worn away, Here it was not possible, from the non-existence of higher
land, that the boulders could have rolled into their present places from above, after
the formation of the shelves; nor was this at all probable in several parts of Tom-
