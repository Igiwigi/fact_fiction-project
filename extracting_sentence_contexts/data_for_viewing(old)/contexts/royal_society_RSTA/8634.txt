where the summation is taken over all the observations, while the formula of
equation (7), since it involves m,’, changes its value discontinuously, when one
observation is gradually increased, at the point where it happens to coincide with a
second observation.

Logically it would seem to be a necessity that that population which is chosen in
fitting a hypothetical population to data should also appear the best when tested for
its goodness of fit. The method of the optimum secures this agreement, and at the
same time provides an extension of the process of testing goodness of fit, to those cases
for which the ,* test is invalid.

The practical value of * lies in the fact that when the conditions are satisfied in
order that it shall closely approximate to 2L, it is possible to give a general formula
for its distribution, so that it is possible to calculate the probability, P, that in a random
sample from the population considered, a worse fit should be obtained ; in such cases
x* is distributed in a curve of the Pearsonian Type III.,

where n’ is one more than the number of degrees of freedom in which the sample may
differ from expectation (17).
