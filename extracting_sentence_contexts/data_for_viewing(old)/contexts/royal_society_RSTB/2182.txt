frog gives the best marked decline in series of normal positive responses. Never-
theless the response of the third stage (vide infra) has, so far as I have seen, proved to
be remarkably persistent. And sometimes, particularly with brief stimulation (for
6 seconds at 1 minute intervals), an increasing deflection has come under observation,

giving a series with “ staircase” increase, like that obtained on cardiac and other
muscle and on nerve. But whereas in the latter case we may feel assurance that the
effect is veritably the result of the stimulation, in the case of the retina this certainty
is obscured by the fact that spontaneous gradual increase and diminution of response
are apt to be present, in consequence, I believe, of the state of eyeball as regards the
internal production of carbonic acid. For this reason I have attached little import-
ance to the detailed examination of fatigue effects and of staircase phenomenon; a
general view of the facts, as they have come under observation, may be gathered from
the following summary table, and from the records given in figs. 3, 3c, 6, 7, and 8.
