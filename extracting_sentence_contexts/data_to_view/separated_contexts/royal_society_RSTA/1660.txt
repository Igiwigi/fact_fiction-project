Disputes over ‘potentially harmful interference’

If conflicts over lunar resources arise in the coming decade, as seems probable, they will
incentivize searches for creative interpretations of the only applicable treaty with broad
international recognition, the 1967 Outer Space Treaty (OST) [47]. More specifically, they may
invite creative interpretations of Article II’s explicit statement that ‘Outer space, including the
Moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty,
by means of use or occupation, or by any other means’. While the letter and the spirit of the
Treaty prohibit formal appropriation, some of its provisions may in fact enable unexpected forms
of de facto appropriation. In particular, Article IX introduces the principle of parties’ ‘due regard’
for the activities of other parties. The Treaty also states that, if a party’s activity could cause
‘potentially harmful interference with activities of other States’, parties can enter in consultations
to address the matter.
