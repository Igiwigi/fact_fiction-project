Using pyrolysis, polystyrene (PS) [19-21] and nylon 6 (PA 6) [22,23] can be converted with high
selectivities to their respective monomers. DSM and Honeywell ran a plant in Augusta, Georgia,
for two years in which nylon carpets were recycled back to caprolactam using this approach. After
two years, the plant had to close again as the operation was not economical. Later, the plant was
taken over by Shaw Industries, who ran it for a few more years, but in 2016, the plant was closed
permanently. Polymers obtained by polycondensation or polyaddition (polyesters, polyamides,
polyurethanes) can also be depolymerized to their monomers using acid- or base-catalysed
hydrolysis or alcoholysis (figure 1c) [11,2427]. The monomers are then retrieved in the form
of alcohols, esters or free acids and in principle can again be fed to a polycondensation reactor
to produce new polymers in virgin quality. It is noteworthy to mention that the methanolysis of
PET to dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) has even been applied on an industrial scale by Hoechst,
Du-Pont and Eastman-Kodak [28]. However, a disadvantage of this process on the one hand
is the recent decline of the price of virgin DMT [29] and on the other hand the fact that in
newly designed PET plants, the direct reaction between terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol
is the preferred method [30]. More recently, companies started to practice glycolysis of waste
PET to form the phthalate bis-ethyleneglycol ester or even higher oligomers that can be used
as raw material for PET [31]. More recently, the depolymerization of this type of polymer
by (transfer)hydrogenation is attracting high attention [32]. Homogeneous hydrogenation and
transfer hydrogenation catalysts are able to break down even post-consumer materials such as
polyesters [33-36], polycarbonates (PCs) [35,37,38], polyurethanes [39] and polyamides [39,40] to
monomers, usually in high purity. Although the activity of the catalysts towards these relatively
poorly reactive substrates is remarkable, catalyst costs are still too high for economic application.
In addition, some of the products have a low value such as methanol (from PC). To summarize,
it is difficult to produce recycled polymers or monomers in a manner that is cost competitive
to their counterparts made directly from fossil fuels as no matter which recycling method is
