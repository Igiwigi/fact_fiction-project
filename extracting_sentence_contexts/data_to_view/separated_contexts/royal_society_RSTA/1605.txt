(6000 Ib./in.*) was reached, but as the
extension then increased very rapidly it was not possible to keep the load at this
maximum value, moreover, as the stressing frame was of rather limited capacity for
large strains, the test could not be carried to fracture, although a total extension of
1'211 inches was obtained. The observations also showed that the permanent
extension was very uniform from section to section. The condition of the material has in fact some resemblance to that of a mild steel
which has been overstrained and allowed to rest. This is shown by a subsequent
experiment in which the loading was repeated and the stress-strain properties examined
anew. It was then found that the elastic limit of the material was still approximately
at 150 lbs.
