The last conclusion is very abundantly proved by the optical analysis of the positive
and negative brushes already described (1468.), the latter set of discharges being
found to recur five or six times oftener than the former*.

1502. If, now, a small ball be made to give brashes or brusby sparks by a powerful
machine, we can, in some measure, understand and relate the difference perceived
when it is rendered positive or negative. It is known to give when positive a much
larger and more powerful spark than when negative, and with greater facility (1482.);
in fact, the spark, although it takes away 80 much more electricity at once, com-
mences at a tension higher only in a small degree, if at all. On the other hand, if
rendered negative, though discharge may commence at a lower degree, it continues
but for a very short period, very little electricity passing away each time. These
circumstances are directly related, for the extent to which the positive spark can
reach, and the size and extent of the positive brush, are consequences of the capa-
bility which exists of much electricity passing off at one discharge from the positive
surface (1468. 1501.).
