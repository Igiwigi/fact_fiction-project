Branches of Pinus silvestris, bearing male flowers with the pollen mother cells still

8 SrrasBurcer (9) in 1892 stated that the number of chromosomes in the pollen of
inus silvestris was twelve. In a later paper (10), owing to the results obtained by
@ixon, he was led to renewed investigations on the pollen. As a result of this later
work, he concludes that “both pollen mother cells and pollen grains of Pinus
silvestris have only eight chromosomes ;” he points out, however, that the counting
is attended with great difficulty. I have examined chiefly the first division of the
pollen mother cells. The irregular shape of the chromosomes and the fact that they
overlap one another renders the counting very difficult ; no attempt can be made to
count them in a side view of the spindle ; in good polar views, however, they can be
counted, though with difficulty. In a considerable number of polar views of nuclei in
the equatorial plate stage, I have been able to count undoubtedly twelve chromosomes,
and in no case in which at all a good view could be obtained were less than ten to be
