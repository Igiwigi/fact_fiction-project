(Bower 1923, 1935; Wetmore 1943). In the former the existence of the
shoot or axis as an independent member is more or less explicitly denied, the plant being
envisaged as a construction of phytons or segments of which the leaf bases or extensions
thereof are the fundamental units (Gaudichaud 1841; Chauveaud 1921). Although such
theories—which usually, but not invariably, e.g. Campbell (1921), have only a subjective
significance—may appear to have a limited application, or may actually possess value for
descriptive purposes, they are artificial and unrelated to the facts of physiology and em-
bryology. The telome theory of Zimmermann (1930), as it seems to the present writer, is
open to similar criticisms. Supporters of axial theories regard the shoot ‘as a phyletically pre-existing axis or stem
from which the leaves may have arisen by enation’ (Lang 1915).
