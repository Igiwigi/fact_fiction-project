Thus, because in each content c all random
variables Ry (q € Qc) are jointly distributed in the operational sense (measured ‘together’), one
can define a random variable H; and functions fq (q € Qc) such that (2.2) holds. This is a context-
specific hidden-variable construction, and it is obviously nonrestrictive, applicable to any system. :
The third meaning of (non)contextuality we are discussing now is about the possibility of a single [=
hidden variable for all contexts, and context-independent functions that map it into the random a
variables comprising the system. In other words, one asks whether there is a random variable H 8
and a set of functions fy (q € Q) such that for any c € C and q € Qc,

Ro =f,(H). 61) os

If (and only if) such a construction is possible, the system is non-contextual in the ‘hidden :
variable’ sense. :3
Applied to our example, the question is about the possibility of replacing (2.4) with [ze

f(A) | f(A) c=1
f(A) | fa(H) || ¢=2

f(A) f(A) |] c=3 *

g=1|q=2)q=3

(5.2)

At every measurement, the variable H has some value, and all six random variables, irrespective
of what context c is being factually measured, are determined by this value. At that, the values of
any two random variables measuring the same content are always equal (because the functions
are labelled by their contents only). It is easy to see that this is precisely the same as the existence,
for any factual measurement, of the assignment of values to all random variables in the system,
such that Ri = RE for any q € Qc N Qe.
