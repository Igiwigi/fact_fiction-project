Although it is already commercial, the Asahi Kasei’s process for phosgene-free
production of aromatic polycarbonate starts from ethylene epoxide, bisphenol-A and CO> [48].

(c) Sources of CO and costs

Often there is a problem regarding the recovery of CO 2 and its purity. This is an important : &
aspect, but we do not feel that it is a critical one, at least in the initial stage of commercialization 22
of CO utilization technologies. In fact, there are many large-volume sources of rather pure Dw
CO), in refinery and chemical processes (ammonia production, ethylene oxide production, gas : “
processing, H2 production, liquefied natural gas, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis coal) as well as from : =
biorefineries (fermentation processes [35]). In the initial phase of introduction of technologies for 3

CO chemical utilization, the recovery of CO from the flue gases of combustion processes, with
the related problems of purification from contaminants, is thus not necessary. It is estimated that globally approximately 500 million tons of low-cost (less than US$20 per
ton) high-concentration CO2 is available annually as a by-product from natural gas processing,
fertilizer plants and some other industrial sources.
