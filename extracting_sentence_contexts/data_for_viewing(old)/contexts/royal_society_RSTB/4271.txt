but the premaxillze and palatines are flatter.

While the median sutures are represented by rather wide gaps in the model, the
palate is otherwise complete, so that the characteristic Marsupial fenestration is, as
PARKER maintained, a secondary feature in the adult. The premacille (p.mz.) are
on.the same horizontal plane as the maxille, making the surface of the palate level
at the anterior end, though, as stated above, the maxille are strongly arched from
side to side.

The palatal processes of the premaxille (fig. 2, proc.p.p.ma.) lie immediately under
the paraseptal cartilages which they partly hide in the ventral view. The processes
are short, not extending further than about one-third the length of the paraseptals.
Tn fact, the premaxille are mere flat plates of bone developed below the floor of the
olfactory capsules ; but further back they become triangular in section, and rise rapidly
on the plates of the capsules. The relative positions of the premaxillse and the
anterior nares are interesting, being intermediate between that observed by Broom
in Trichosurus and Dasyurus. The premaxilla in Dasyurus is entirely posterior to
the anterior nares; in 7â€™richoswrus it occupies a more anterior position, overlapping
the ventral floor of the anterior nares.

The maxilla (mx.) rises higher on the sides of the capsules than does the pre-
maxilla (fig. 5). Its triangular form in section is broken by the large tooth groove,
which is a conspicuous feature of the bone in a palatal view (fig. 2). The tooth germs
are present, and are of a considerable size. In the lateral view of the skull the deep
groove, in which the infraorbital nerve lies, is seen. This will later be surrounded by bone
