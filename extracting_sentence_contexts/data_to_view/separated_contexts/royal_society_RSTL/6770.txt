have meddled with any more ; but as I ſeem to, be
called upon, to defend what I have formerly wrote,
I hope Lihall be excuſed if I briefly attempt it. Your
Lordſhip, I know, and our illuſtrious Body only
deſire a fair repreſentation of facts,: which. is the
ground of all philoſophical inquiries; and therefore
T ſhall endeavour. to do.this,. as far as I can, without:
regarding any hypotheſis. My deſign, when I firſt entered 'on this ſubje&t,,
was to diſcover whether our people were in an increa-
fing or decreaſing ſtate, with regard totheir numbers 3,
which 1 thought of great importance to be known,
becauſe of its influence on the affairs of Government,
in determining our frength, in ſettling of taxes, and
direRting us in the ceconomy and imployment of our
people. Now, in order. to' proceed-.in this inquiry,
it was evident «to. me,. that if the number of houſes
were exaQtly known, the number of. people would
be nearly aſcertained. , And therefore I attended to-
this, to find out the ntamber of houſes, as the only
thing that could with any certainty help-us to Judge
of this matter; © And accordingly, beig reſolved to.
depend only upon the moſt ſure, and-general. obſer-
vations, I applied to a public office, where I thought
I might poſlbly get at their nomber., And I there
found, that from. the laſt ſurvey that was made, ſince
the year 1750, there were 690,700, houſes in En-
gland and Wales that paid the window-tax, and the
two-thilling duty on houſes; beſides cortages that paid
nothing. © By cottages are underſtood thoſe who! nei-
ther pay to church or poor, and are, by-a& of par-
liament in 1747, in confideration of the! poverty of

tax and the two-ſhillings duty; and they only remain
not accurately known, to aſcertain the whole number
of houſes.
