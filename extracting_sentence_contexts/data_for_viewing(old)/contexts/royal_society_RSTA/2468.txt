Carbon has been for a long time the standard material for the plasma facing component as
it is rather forgiving when the plasma touches the wall. Unfortunately, carbon reacts easily with
hydrogenic isotopes (including tritium) to form carbohydrates. Additionally, carbon easily forms
dust with the result that much of the tritium would lay on the bottom of the tokamak. Therefore,


in Europe, a clear decision was made towards metallic plasma facing components. This was
first pioneered on ASDEX Upgrade which was gradually equipped with a tungsten wall and
later followed by JET, where most of the wall was changed to beryllium, while the divertor was
changed to tungsten. As a result, the tritium retention dropped by a factor of 20, to a level low
enough for ITER to be able to work for a long time without any opening to get the tritium out
[11,12]. A drawback of the metallic wall, however, is the fact that it is less straightforward to make
high-performance plasmas, as the heavy metals from the divertor have a tendency to migrate
into the core plasma. Special operational procedures are needed to achieve high-performance
operation in a metal wall tokamak. This involves ample central heating, seeding of the edge
plasma with noble gasses, flushing impurities with benign Edge Localized Modes, etc. Detailed
studies at JET [13] over a number of years were needed to bring the performance with the ITER-
Like Wall back to the same level as with the former Carbon wall. The effect of choking of the
plasma performance due to influx of heavy metal impurities is, in general, less severe in a large
tokamak with a larger volume to surface ratio.

The operation at high performance, near the operational limits, comes at a price. Namely,
disruptions in which the plasma comes to a sudden termination lead to strong forces on the
vacuum vessel [14]. These become stronger for larger devices and therefore much effort needs to
