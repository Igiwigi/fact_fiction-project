'= From the foregoing account it is evident that the inferior position of the ovary of
Victoria is only apparent, and that the structure consists of a circle of numerous distinct
*Sxarpels collaterally united and imbedded in an enlarged receptacle which runs up in a
Seirele around them, carrying up the stamens and floral envelopes, and likewise rising
-Sinto a columella in the centre, where its expansion carries up to some extent the bases
Sof the carpels and brings them into an oblique and almost horizontal position. This
-Zremoves any difficulty which might arise in considering the relation of this genus with
Zothers where the ovary is distinctly snperior.
| S Many other particulars of less consequence were observed, which for the most part
"Shave been correctly explained by preceding observers; such are the structure of the
orifices found in the leaves, called by PLaxcnox * stomatodes,‚Äù the form of the pollen, &ec.
*#For an account of these we refer to M. Tr6cu1/s memoir *.
EZ In conclusion, I must briefly allude to the bearing of the facts contained in the present,
Epaper upon the systematic position of the Nympheacee. Notwithstanding that the
Sanatomical character of the roots adds one more Dicotyledonous feature to the character
got these plants, T am more inclined than ever to regard the structure of the rhizome as
Zconforming to the general type of the stem of Monocotyledons rather than to that of
EDicotyledons, among which I have found nothing at all like it. But I do not consider
Athat this character alone can decide the position of the Order, the majority of whose
characters are, on the contrary, clearly Dicotyledonous; it merely brings it into the
position of a link between the two classes, which are by no means 80 markedly separated
from each other as is often supposed from the mode of their arrangement in Systematic
works. A further attempt at the settlement of the true affinities of this Order does not
come within the scope of the present paper.
