This, however, in pro-
portion as it saturated itself with the new formed substance,
gradually lost its colour, acquired a greater consistence, and
at last, at the end of three weeks, it was entirely converted
into a solid white crystalline body, having the appearance of
camphor. i
This substance being separated from the acid, and washed
with cold water, presented the following characters: it was
colourless; its smell resembled both that of muriated sulphur
and of oxyd of osmium; its taste was both acrid and acid; it
was very volatile, melted at a gentle heat, and sublimed with-
out residue. In fact, this body very closely resembles cam-
phor in its external properties. It is insoluble in water, but
readily dissolves in alcohol and ether, from which it is precipi-
tated by water; it is also soluble in the oils, whether fixed or
volatile, with which it forms transparent solutions. The spi-
rituous s0Jution of this substance has a peculiar, disagreeable,
and very acid taste.
