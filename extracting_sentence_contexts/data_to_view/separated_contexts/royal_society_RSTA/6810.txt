Z would require Z to be large, in
conflict with the requirement | Y|>Z (Y = 16 for 80kc/s) necessary for the splitting into
two regions. For this frequency, and for both values of ¢, the downward reflexion coefficient
is negligibly small. It will be noted that there is a marked difference between the reflexion
coefficients for ¢ = 0 and ¢ = 47; this arises from the fact that the thickness of the region is
comparable with the wave-length at 80 kc/s. Waves of both polarizations are reflected from region II, and both have their polariza-
tions altered by reflexion, so that both reflexion and conversion coefficients are significant. The two conversion coefficients are related by the equations

| Pry | ,/cos 6 a | Pryx | /sec 4,
and arg Py = F1-+arg py,

The curves of figures 5 and 6 show how the magnitudes and phases of the coefficients vary
with angle for the waves of frequency 16kc/s, and figures 15 and 16 relate to a frequency
of 80 kc/s.
