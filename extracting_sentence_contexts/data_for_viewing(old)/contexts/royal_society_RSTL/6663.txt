are composed of large turbinations imbedded in a dense mass of small leaflets, and both
leaflets and turbinations lie at right angles to the cribriform plate, in Man there are no
$nch leaflets and only two stunted turbinated processes, which, instead of descending to
fill the nasal cavity, immediately curve backwards 80 as to occupy as little room as
possible. And not only is the ethmoid 80 rudimentary, but by the curvature of the
cranial arch, the vomer is moved away from it; its anterior extremity sloping rapidly to
a lower level, and its posterior being pushed backwards under the sphenoid. Of this
latter fact we may be convinced by comparing the position of the human vomer with
that of the same bone in the Cat. The Cat has got sphenoidal sinuses as well as Man,
but they are floored-in entirely by projections downwards from the wings of InGras814s;
and the part of the yomer which is continued into the ethmovyomerine lamine lies, not
underneath the sinuses, but underneath the ethmoid, immediately in front of the sinuses,
Moreover, it is very important to keep in mind that the margin of the ethmoid which
is placed posteriorly in the human skull is that which is morphologically inferior, and
which corresponds to that to which the ethmoyomerine lamina is habitually attached,
and to which therefore it behoved that the human yomer should be connected. This
will be best illustrated by using the vomer and ethmoid of the Sheep, Dog, or Rabbit
for comparison. It will then be easily understood, on referring to Plate IV. fig. 5, how
there comes to be a space left between the ethmoid and yomer, to bridge oyer which the
