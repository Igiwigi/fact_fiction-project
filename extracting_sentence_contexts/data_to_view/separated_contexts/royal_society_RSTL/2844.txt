This corneous case of the stem is easily seen to be
continuous with the cells that arise from it, but the internal substance cannot be di-
stinctly traced to the animals as in Sertularia. It is probable, however, that it passes
gradually into the parietes of the body by which the cells are lined. With the facts
before us of the progressive growth of the stem, and the production from it of buds or
geminz, which gradually develop into mature animals, no doubt can be entertained
either as to the vitality of this part, or of the direct communication between it and
the young animals, at least up to the period at which they begin to emerge from
their cells and to seek nourishment for themselves. Nor is it reasonable to suppose
that this communication ever aſter ceases, for then it would be impossiþle to account
for the nutrition of the growing parts, and the combined operations by which the
regularity of growth of the whole is maintained, as exemplified in the ramified species
by the proportionate thickening of the stem to the number of branches which it has
to bear, and in the definite forms which each species assumes. But it might be questioned whether the whole of the stock is a living part, or only
the soft interior; while the more dense exterior, together with the cell, might be re-
garded as a mere exudation from it.
