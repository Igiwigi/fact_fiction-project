Our results, together with recent findings that clinical severity of COVID-19 in children
is lower than that for adults [19,25] and that prolonged school closure could significantly
impair the emotional, mental and physical health of schoolchildren (see below) suggest that
school closure may not be ideal as a sustained primary NPI for controlling COVID-19. In
fact, the specific objective underlying school closure should be more clearly articulated so
that alternative options could be comparatively assessed. For example, the overall disease
transmission in the population could be mitigated by reducing infectious contacts (e.g. by
enhancing personal infection prevention) which is likely to be more feasible and less disruptive to
childrenâ€™s overall wellbeing than school closure (https: / / www.cdc.gov /coronavirus/2019-ncov /
community /schools-childcare/operation-strategy.html). On the other hand, short-term school
suspension could and should be considered when other NPIs (e.g. avoidance of mass gatherings,
physical distancing in workplace and community, enhanced personal hygiene, etc.) are already in
place, where the marginal effect of school closure is critical to achieving the target control levels
(e.g. when hospitals have exceeded their surge capacity and clinical outcomes including the case-
fatality risk are on the verge of unnecessarily deteriorating simply because the health system is
about to implode).
