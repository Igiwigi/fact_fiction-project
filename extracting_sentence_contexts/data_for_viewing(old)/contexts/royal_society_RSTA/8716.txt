molecule possesses no resultant magnetic moment. For example, while iron below the
critical temperature possesses, according to WErIss, 11 magnetons to the atom, the
molecule of ferric sulphate possesses 30, ferric chloride 28, sodium ferro-pyrophosphate
26, sodium ferrous oxalate 27.* Again, nickel below the critical temperature possesses
3 magnetons to the atom, above the critical temperature either 8 or 9 magnetons to
the atom, while a molecule of nickel sulphate contains 16 magnetons. In general the
number of magnetons, per molecule of a salt of a ferro-magnetic element, is large
compared with the number of magnetons associated with an atom of the pure
ferro-magnetic. The fact that cupric salts are paramagnetic while cuprous ones are
diamagnetic is interesting from our point of view. Although copper is diamagnetic,
yet a molecule of cupric sulphate contains 10 magnetons. It seems as if the large
local atomic fields, which have been recognised in diamagnetic and ferro-magnetic
molecules, have the power, when the molecules approach so that their fields overlap,
to upset the equilibrium of the atoms in combination and redistribute their magnetic
elements, This is easily possible when the great intensity of the local molecular
field is borne in mind. In most cases a diamagnetic molecule, on account of its
symmetry, would, under the influence of such a field, remain diamagnetic, but each
orbit would be distorted by the field and the sete icc of the substance would be
slightly modified.
