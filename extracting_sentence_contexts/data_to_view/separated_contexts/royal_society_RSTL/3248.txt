AND OF OTHER PARTS OF LOCHABER IN SCOTLAND. 77

difference from that curve exists, it must be very small*, Here then is a case which
supports apparently with more weight than perhaps any one hitherto advanced, the
doctrine that the land is the stationary element in these changes of level, and the
ocean the fluctuating one; for it may well be asked, can we suppose that a whole
country shall have been lifted up without the smallest ascertained flexure of the an-
cient coast lines? Without reverting to the argument of the movements now in pro-
gress, 80me upwards and some downwards, or to the difficulty of imagining a recep-
tacle for a stratum of water, nearly 1300 feet thick, concentric with the globe, I will
consider the phenomenon in another point of view. It appears from the facts given
by Mr. Lys in his Principles of Geology, and in the Philosophical Transactionsf,
that a large territory in Sweden is now rising at the rate of three feet in a century ;
and that the area affected reaches from Gottenburgh to Torneo, and thence to North
Cape (a distance of 1000 geographical miles), although the rate of elevation increases
as we proceed northward. We may therefore safely conclude, that large spaces in
Scandinavia have been elevated s0 equably, that at points several miles, if not leagues
apart, the difference of elevation at the close of the past century, did not amount to
one foot.
