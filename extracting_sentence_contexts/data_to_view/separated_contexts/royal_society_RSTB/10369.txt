Robust perception of statistically reliable
phonological patterns in natural language does not emerge
until eight to 10 months of age, after children have had
many months of exposure to language [6-8]. For instance,
the perceptual reorganization documented by Werker &
Tees [6] is thought to reflect the influence of statistical knowl-
edge on phonetic categories in natural language [9]. Such
categories are thought to constrain infantsâ€™ ability to detect
non-native contrasts by eight to 10 months despite the fact
that infants show rapid SL of phonetic categories as early
as six months in a laboratory study [9]. How do we resolve the seeming inconsistency of rapid
extraction of statistics in the laboratory with the slow pace of
real-world language learning? For one, laboratory stimuli are
often highly focused on the pattern to be learned with high
density input, whereas real-life input may occur in spaced
intervals with exceptions to the most reliable patterns depend-
ing on the language.
