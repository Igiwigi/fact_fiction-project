In this 73
paper, the use of a fractional order calculus to model the heating process using a thermoelectric :
module also known as the Peltier module is presented. This paper is organized as follows. In ยง2, the basic facts on fractional calculus are described. Section 3 gives a mathematical description of the heating process. In ยง4, experimental verification
of the heating process model is described.
