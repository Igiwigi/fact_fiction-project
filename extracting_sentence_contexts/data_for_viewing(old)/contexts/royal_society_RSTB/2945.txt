Calcified Rods.

These are calcified structures peculiar to the filaments of the Unionide and
Miilleria. Much confusion has arisen from the fact that some authors, such as
Lancer (49, p. 44), Posner (76), Rast (81, p. 352), and Simpson (94, p. 182)
failed to discriminate between the thickened bands of chitin (Stibchen) such as
occur in the majority of Eulamellibranch gills and these calcareous rods embedded
in the chitin, first noted by RENGARTEN in 1853 (82), and described by Hesstine
in 1859 (33, p. 228) as “ Kalkstiibehen.” The Stiibehen of chitin are but local
thickenings of what must be regarded as a general lining of the filamentar, and

* KELLOGG, curiously enough, does not admit that the intrafilamentar septum is composed of chitin
(42, p. 421, Pecten irradians). He regaids it as cellular—endothelium, in fact.

frequently also the lacunar cavities, and it is only by disregarding the thinner
parts of the chitin that these thickenings can be taken for rods at all. Tt is true
that they bear a certain resemblance to rods in some cases, ¢.g., Panopea generosa
(fig. 49, p. 258) and Pholas crispata, but a few simple reactions, such as the employ-
ment of acids, alkalies, and differential stains, soon enable one to distinguish that
these are not the calcified rods under discussion. Bonner did not fall into the
common error, and it was he who first remarked that these structures are not
met with outside the family Unionidee (5, p. 322). Kotimann (48, p. 592) correctly
