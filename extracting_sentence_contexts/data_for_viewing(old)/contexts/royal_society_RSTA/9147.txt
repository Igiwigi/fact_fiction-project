INTRODUCTION.

3 Or the various possible methods of approaching present day problems of electro-
= magnetic radiation—particularly the problem of reconciling with the older electro-
ic magnetic theory those experimental facts which have led to the formulation of the
Quantum Theory—the most profitable is probably to be found in the study of the
® phenomena of Réntgen radiation.

& Primarily this is due not to the accuracy which may be attained in measurements
‘S upon radiation of this type, though this is an important factor, but to the
fundamental nature of the phenomena themselves. The result of this is shown both
5 in the simplicity and in the generality of the laws observed.

2 My purpose in this lecture is to call attention to some of the most significant
experimental facts bearing on the nature of the processes resulting in the emission of
; X-rays—dwelling especially on the work I have been able to do in the last few
years. Some of this I indicated in short notices appearing in ‘ Nature ’* at the
