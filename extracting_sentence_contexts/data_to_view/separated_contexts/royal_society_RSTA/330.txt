Thus, selecting the direction of causality is simply reduced to choosing aia
between two ICA models. 7y
In principle, we could just estimate ICA on the vector x = (x1,x2) and see whether the mixing iN
matrix is closer to the form of the one in model 1 or model 2. The zeros in the mixing matrices :3
are in different places, which clearly distinguish them. A more efficient way of choosing between : BY
the models can be based on likelihood ratios of the two models [13,14]. (An earlier approach used .
cumulants [15].)
In fact, this is just a special case of the general problem of estimating a linear Bayesian network,
or an SEM. In the general SEM, we model the observed data vector x as

and

x=Bx+e or xj= > bixj + ei, (3.5)
iAi

with a matrix B that has zeros in the diagonal. The idea that each x; is a function of the other x;
formalizes the causal connections between the different variables.
