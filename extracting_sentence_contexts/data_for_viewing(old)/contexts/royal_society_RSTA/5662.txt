bifurcation at the bifurcation point, critical information for the design and control of dynamical
systems. The full set of identified coefficients for the dynamics is shown in table 1 and figure 2.
Note that the fast eigenvalues of the system, which capture the off-manifold dynamics of the
system, have also been detected. It is worth mentioning that the centre manifold coordinates are
not unique, meaning that if y is a solution, i = cy is also a solution in the latent space, where c is
an arbitrary coefficient. As a result, the reference dynamics y = B()y1 — ry and the identified
dynamics in =B(u)i1 + wif are topologically equivalent as long as the signs of the nonlinear
terms match, i.e. w <0. In the training process, we restricted the norm of w to be unity so that
only the bifurcation type is identified.

To evaluate the identified centre manifold and coordinate transformations using the trained
networks, we take the trained N2; block and set its input to [y1,y2 =0,8 =0] and analyse the
network output for a range of input y; values (figure 3). In fact, we are enforcing the dynamics
to remain on the centre manifold in the latent space, and aim to identify its geometry in the
original coordinates. Figure 3 shows the identified centre manifold compared with the reference
