If the equations of motion are not linear in the parameters of
interest, the difficulties multiply. Another issue is concerned with confidence in derived parameter
estimates. This issue is a result of the fact that measurements or data from a system will, in reality,
almost always be contaminated by random noise. Given a set of data D = {(xj,y;),i=1,...,N}
of sampled system inputs x; and outputs y;, if there is no measurement noise, an identification
algorithm should yield a deterministic estimate of the system parameters 0,

0 =id(D), (2.1)

where the function id represents the application of the identification algorithm to the data D. Now, if noise e(f) is present on the input or output data (or both), 6 will become a random vector
conditioned on the data.
