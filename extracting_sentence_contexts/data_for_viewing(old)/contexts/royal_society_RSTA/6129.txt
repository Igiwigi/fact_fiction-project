I(Ee) = â€” log F(E > 0), (1.1)

where F(E > @) is the fraction of all sequences (say, given a particular length L) that perform the
function at a level at least 0.

Such a definition of functional information makes eminent sense (it implies that functional
sequences are exponentially rare) and accurately links information content to functionality. For
example, in the evolution of RNA molecules that encode an enzymatic activity [3], functional
information is correlated to both activity and structural complexity. In the evolution of HIV
protease [4], functional information can be seen to decrease when anti-viral drugs are given
(reflecting the reduced activity of the protease), then to increase again as anti-viral resistance
emerges. In fact, functional information defined in this manner turns out to be just the coarse-
grained Shannon information content of the sequences [5].

A shortcoming of this measure is that only large groups of sequences can be characterized
in this manner, because accurately estimating the fraction F(E > 6) necessitates large ensembles
of functional sequences. Here we develop an approach that allows us to attach a score
to every individual sequence in an ensemble, which then allows us to predict the level of
functionality of individual sequences not in the ensemble. In particular, this approach allows
us to study how functional information emerges from multi-site correlations within the
sequence.
