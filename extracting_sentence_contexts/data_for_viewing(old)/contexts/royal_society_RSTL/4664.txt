A low temperature, however, must be unfavourable to diffusion experiments, from
inereasing the tendency of salts to crystallize.

In conelusion, I may sum up the results of most -interest which this inquiry re-
specting liquid diffusion has hitherto furnished.


46 PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE DIFFUSION OF LIQUIDS,

1. I would place first the method. of observing liquid diffusion. This method,
although simple, appears to admit of sufficient exactness, It enables us to make a
new class of observations which can be expressed in numbers, and of which a vast
variety of substances may be the object, in fact everything soluble, Diffusion is also
a property of a fundamental character, upon which other properties depend, like the
volatility of substances ; while the number of substances which are soluble and there-
fore diffusible, appears to be much greater than the number of volatile bodies.

2. The novel scale of Solution Densities, which are suggested by the different dif-
fusibilities of salts, and to which alone, guided by the analogy of gaseous diffusion,
we can refer these diffasibilities. Liquid diffusion thus supplies the densities of anew
kind of molecules, but nothing more respecting them.

The fact that the relations in diffusion of different substances refer to equal
weights of those substances, and not to their atomic weights or equivalents, is one
which reaches to the very basis of molecular chemistry. The relation most frequently
