His theory is, however, worked out only for plants
in which the primordia may be considered to be circular in outline, and consequently
it needs to be further considered to what extent it will hold good for plants such as the
Lupin, in which, on accouut of the stipules, the outline of the primordia is certainly not
circular. Moreover, even with regard to plants with circular primordia, there remains


38 M. SNOW AND R. SNOW: EXPERIMENTS ON PHYLLOTAXIS. at least one group of facts of which Van Irerson has not been able to offer any con-
vineing explanation (1907, p. 247 seq). But since it is intended presently to report
further experiments on phyllotaxis, discussion of these questions will be postponed. Here, however, it will just be pointed out that Van Irersonâ€™s theory suffices to
render intelligible the origin of Fibonacci phyllotaxis systems in seedlings.
