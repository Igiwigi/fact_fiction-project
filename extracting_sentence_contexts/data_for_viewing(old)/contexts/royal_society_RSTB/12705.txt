Note that for the case of two sites, there is only one

second-order phenotype that matters, 4,2, as opposed to

three in the case of two scalar traits (fi, $192, and $3). This (a) A solution: the population transform
is because all the terms in the yw vectors are 0 or 1, both of
which remain unchanged when we square them. For the
same reason, there are no third or higher order terms if we
