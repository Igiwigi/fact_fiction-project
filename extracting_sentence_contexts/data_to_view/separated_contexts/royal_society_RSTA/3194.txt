This automatically reduces the anharmonic constant matrix to a single
element. In addition, this single anharmonic constant has a different value compared to the one
used in FD SCTST. Interestingly, the resulting rate constants in fact show a better agreement to the
corresponding FD results [1,9]. Furthermore, to improve the performance of SCTST, in particular,
in a low-temperature region, the application of the deep-tunnelling correction proposed by
Wagner et al. [14] has been applied to both FD and 1D SCTST [1,8,9,13]. In the current study, we use 1D SCTST of the second assumption level described above with
the deep-tunnelling correction to investigate the reaction rate constants for the following two
reactions in both the forward and reverse directions:

R1: CH30H +H =CH30 + Hy

and
R2: CH30H +H=CH)OH + Hp.
