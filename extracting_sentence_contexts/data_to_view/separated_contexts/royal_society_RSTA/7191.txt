For a point in the shadow the pressure is the sum of the contributions from the first dif-
fraction wave from either edge and may be written

y =—Y<0, t<r,+1:
p(t, —X,y) = 3[G)(7, —X,t—r) + G(r, + X, t—14)]
—4[Go(r.—X, tr) — G(r, +X, t—19)], (90)
where Gy is the function already defined by equation (40). For a point in the direct line of the slit we have the direct contribution of the external
incident pulse added to the diffraction wave contributions and the pressure is given by

O<y<h, t<r,41:
b(t, —X,y) = H(t—X) —HGq(r,—X, t—1,) —Gg(ry +X, #1) ]
—43[Go(r2—X, tr) — Go(7g +X, t—1) ]. (91)

On the edge of the shadow y = 0, the two forms (90) and (91) are equivalent, since the

change of sign in the first G, term balances the additional contribution of the incident pulse
in (91). ;

For a point on the plane of symmetry, y = }, when X is large we have

When ¢— X is not small, 8X(¢—X) is large and we can drop the tan“! symbol in the first
term to obtain the result (88) corresponding to the behaviour of the slit as a simple source. It will be noted that as ¢—X increases, the first term in (93) decreases whilst the second
increases, and the pressure has in fact a minimum, within the range of validity of (93), given
