the nucleus is © cast off as a useless member, and absorbed$.” Scnwaxx had said,
that, with the exception of fat-globules having in some instances, in fat-cells, been
seen to arise out of it, he had never observed anything whatever to be produced by the
nucleus of the cellh. My observations, on the contrary, showed the nucleus to have
a higher office to perform than that of giving origin simply to the membrane of a
cell; that, instead of being © cast off as useless, and absorbed,” the nucleus is the
source of new substance,—a centre for the origin, not only of the transitory contents
of its own cell (© Zelleninhalt” of German authors), but also of the two or three prin-
cipal and last formed cells. destined to succeed that cell ; and, in fact, that by far
the greater portion of the nucleus, instead of existing anterior to the formation of
the cell, arises within its cavity.—A separation of the nucleus into two or three parts,
where previously observed—namely, in the globule of pus and mucus—had been
attributed by GuTzrBock, HexLE, and others, to a chemical reagent used in the exa-
mination—acetic acid||. But, we saw that neither acetic acid nor any other foreign
