Let this be held in mind, and then all those bony plates in the Salmon's head which
do not engraft themselves upon the cartilaginous skull and face can be arranged into
one category—the splints, or © parostoses.” The deeper strata of bony deposit, on account of their peculiar behaviour correlative
to the endoskeleton as © ectosteal ” laminee, are, as it were, taken into the very body and
substance of the endoskeleton, and become part and parcel of it; they may be called
8econdary endoskeletal elements, in contradistinction to the parts into which they grow,
which are primary. Thus in morphological species, as well as zoological, there is frequently a dovetailing
of members, a mutual trespassing of territories; and the sharp boundaries, which for
