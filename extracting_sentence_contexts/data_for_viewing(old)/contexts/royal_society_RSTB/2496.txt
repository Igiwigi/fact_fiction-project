18 DR. G. L. JOHNSON ON THE COMPARATIVE ANATOMY

oval disc similar to that of many Ungulates and certain Rodents. The disc is
covered with a network of black pigment, which we shall meet with in the Cervide.
I can offer no suggestion as to why the Suricate and Cynictis should differ so entirely
from all the other Carnivora. The Cynictis and the Suricate have, moreover, the
horizontally oval pupil common to the Artiodactyla. The only other Carnivores
which have horizontally oval pupils are some of the Herpestes; the other Viverridee
have all vertically oval pupils like all the smaller Felide.

The divergence, refraction, and Membrana nictitans are the same as in thé Felidee.
In one other respect again the Spotted Ichneumon (Herpestes nepalensis) forms an
exception ; in fact, it has a peculiarity which I have not found in any other Mammal,
which consists in the power of rotating at will either eye outwards. This power of
unilateral excursion, common to certain of the Reptiles, such as the Chameleons,
must be due to a special mechanism of co-ordination, and it would be worth while
investigating whether there is any variation in the optic commissure.

3. Hyenide.—All the Hyzenas, viz., H. striata, H. crocuta (Spotted Hyena), and
H. brunnea (Brown Hyzena), resemble the Felidee and some of the Viverridee, having
the same retinal vascularisation, and the fundus divided into three zones—the peri-
pheral violet, the intermediate green, and the central golden yellow. The dise is
brown and not cupped ; the fundus is covered with minute dots as in the Felide.
The pupils of all three species are vertically oval when the animal is at rest. As
soon as it is disturbed by any noise or in any other way, the pupils instantaneously
