cognition, metacognition and memory. Dreams are widely
accepted to involve vivid and intense forms of multimodal
imagery; these are often described as hallucinatory or even per-
ceptual ([1,92]; but see [26]). Visual imagery, followed by

auditory imagery and movement sensations, are the predomi-
nant forms of imagery, whereas thermal, tactile, pain, nausea,
ticklish, and proprioceptive sensations are described in only
14% of laboratory reports [111, p. 198; 112]. Dreams are also
commonly characterized as bizarre and emotional and
marked by cognitive deficits involving deficient reasoning
and short- and long-term memory as well as a lack of metacog-
nitive insight into the fact that one is now dreaming. These
characteristics are particularly pronounced for REM sleep
dreams and dreams from the second half of the night [35].
They have also been linked to changes in regional patterns of
brain activation during REM sleep, giving rise to hypotheses
about their neural correlates [92].

Overall, these findings suggest that in dreams, imagery
dominates over thinking. However, this should not be taken
to imply that thinking or even instances of metacognition are
uniformly absent in dreams. Lucid dreams, in which dreamers
realize they are dreaming and often have some degree of con-
trol over the unfolding events, are a good example [51,53];
