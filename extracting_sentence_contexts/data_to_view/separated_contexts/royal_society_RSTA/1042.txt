The tr-RIXS spectrum is then obtained by scanning the D8

RIXS is formally described by the Kramers—Heisenberg formula, which involves transitions : é

In this process, incident photons with wavevector k, polarization € and energy w x are scattered
to states k’, e’ and wy creating excitations with wavevector Q=k’ — k and energy w = ay — ox. Eg, Ey and E; are the energies of |g), |) and | f) and I, is the inverse core hole lifetime. Several
important facts follow from a detailed consideration of equation (2.1). Since the X-ray wavelength
(1~10 A) is significantly larger than the extent of an atomic orbital (~0.1 A), D and D* can
often be considered under the dipole approximation. As the dipole transitions depend on €
and ¢’, the X-ray polarization can be exploited to help select the desired excitation [6].
