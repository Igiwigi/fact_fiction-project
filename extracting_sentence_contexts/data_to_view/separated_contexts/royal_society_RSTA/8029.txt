Besides the symbols previously defined, Z,, s,; Z, 8, (mean and standard deviation
of each sample), we shall need the following: %, the mean, and sp, the standard deviation
of the sample of N = n, + , individuals formed by putting together the two samples
x, and 4. The probability law po will be given by

log py = — Nlog /2% —Nlogo — 35 (@— a) +82}. « (198)

The condition (A) is obviously satisfied by po, and following the same line of argument
as in example (10) we find that the other conditions (B) and (C) are satisfied also. In fact,

H’,, the composite hypothesis to be tested, specifies only one parameter
and it is easy to see that ¢’, and ¢’, are linear functions of the corresponding ¢’s. Now the equation, 4, = constant, is equivalent to

C, being an arbitrary constant. Clearly the family F («®)) of hypersurfaces W (¢,)
corresponding to this last equation is independent of «), and hence we conclude that
the best critical region w, of size « may be built up of elements wo (¢;, ¢2).
