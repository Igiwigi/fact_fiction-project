There is no liquid body among the many examined that impedes the induced con-
traction ; pure water, slightly acidulated and saline water, serum, blood, olive oil, di-
lated alcohol, the varnish of alcohol and resin, volatile oil of turpentine are the
liquids made use of in these experiments, and through which the induced contraction
takes place. I am always accustomed to let some drops of the liquid under experi-
ment fall upon the muscle, and to dip the nerye of the galvanoscopic frog in the same
liquid. The induced contraction still sabsists even if a thin sheet of felt imbued
with the above-mentioned liquids is interposed between the muscle and the nerve.

The slight conductibility of some of the liquids made use of (oil, oil of turpentine,
varnish, &c.) has made me doubt whether the induced contraction would not subsist
even in 8pite of the interposition of an absolutely insulating body. I assured myself, in
fact, that across a layer, even very thin, of the said liquids, neither the muscular cur-
rent nor the proper one was propagated. On holding the galvanoscopic frog in the
hand, and causing its nerve to come into contact with a wetted paper that in any
manner communicates with the ground, the contraction, as is well-known, is obtained.
The same thing happens on touching with the nerve of the galvanoscopic frog, the
muscles either of a frog or of any other animal in communication with the earth. In
all these cases it is always the proper current that circulates through the observer, the
ground, the touched body, and the galvanoscopic frog. Now if we wet the nerye-of
the galvanoscopic frog either in common oil, or in oil of turpentine, or in varnish,
