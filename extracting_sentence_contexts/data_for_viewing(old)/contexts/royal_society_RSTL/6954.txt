& periodical variation of which the epoch of minimum might be assigned to the years

1843 and 1844, but of which the period or cycle had yet to be learnt. The phenomena
were not peculiar to a single station, but were found to correspond in localities most
distant from each other: nor were they confined to one only of the magnetic elements,
but were exhibited by all, each element having its own distinct instrumental means of
measurement. 'They were therefore recognized as the indication of a magnetic affection
common to the whole of our globe, constituting a periodical variation in the amount of
disturbance in different years. In 1851 and 1852 the annual ratios of disturbance were
found to be everywhere decidedly on the decrease, the epoch of maximum appearing to
have taken place in 1848-1849. The evidence of the existence of a decennial variation
appearing to be thus complete, its aunouncement, as a fact of which the knowledge was
acquired by a process of investigation specially designed for the discoyery of any such
periodical variation, if one should exist, was on the point of taking place, when a fortu-
nate incident (the receipt from M. vs HuMBoLDr of a proof-sheet of his * Kosmos,‚Äù con-
taining the first publication of HopraTy ScawaBr's Table of the variations of the solar
spots from 1826 to 1850) brought to my knowledge the existence of a corresponding
variation in the physical aspect of the sun, precisely similar in period and epochs to
the terrestrial magnetic variation, The importance of a revelation which gave a present

apparent connexion, and presented the promise of establishing a permanent connexion,

between the preyiously isolated terrestrial magnetic phenomena and the physical affec-
