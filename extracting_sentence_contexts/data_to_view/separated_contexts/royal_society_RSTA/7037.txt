The process
described above then assigns to / a well-defined normal word (of length n, ifn >1; of length

which represents /. If P is not generated by the G,, then there will be elements of P which
are not represented by any normal word; and if P is not the generalized free product of the
G,, then there may be elements represented by more than one normal word. In fact we can
prove a converse of theorem (2-4) :

TueoreM. Let the group P have subgroups G,(ae A) which intersect pairwise in a common
subgroup H. ;
i G,.Gy=H (a,feA, a+f). If every element pÂ« P is represented by at least one normal word (as defined above) and if normal words
of different lengths represent different elements of P, then P is the generalized free product of the G,,
and thus in particular every element is represented by a unique} normal word. (3-3)
Proof.
