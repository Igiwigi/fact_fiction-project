as representation of physical quantities, states, time evolution, etc. with respect to it? We present
a solution to these questions in this paper, building on previous work in the topos approach to
quantum theory, which was initiated by Isham, Butterfield and Hamilton [5,6] and substantially
developed mainly by Isham, Doring and others [7-20]. For some closely related work by Heunen
et al. and by Wolters; see [21-24].

We show that the spectral presheaf plays the role of a quantum state space and hence gives
a geometric counterpart to the non-Abelian algebra A of physical quantities. The key step is the
generalization from a set (of points) with structure, such as a compact Hausdorff space, to a
presheaf (with ‘no points’, in a sense to be explained) with structure. This allows us to define
a generalization of the Gelfand spectrum to non-Abelian C*- and W*-algebras, which is just the
technical tool we need. We emphasize physical interpretation rather than mathematical details,
for which we provide sufficient references. No knowledge of topos theory is required, and, in fact,
topos theory plays no major role in this paper.


There are various other sophisticated and highly developed approaches to non-commutative
geometry, see, for example, Connes and Marcolli from a differential geometric perspective [25,26];
Manin and Majid from deformation and quantum groups [27,28]; Kontsevich and Rosenberg
from algebraic geometry [29,30]; also Hrushovski & Zilber from geometric model theory [31].
Our approach differs from all these in various respects. The topos approach provides the most
concrete geometric examples of non-commutative spaces in the form of spectral presheaves,
whereas the other approaches are more algebraic in nature. Yet, the other approaches to non-
commutative spaces and their geometry are developed more fully, and we hope and expect to
implement some of their structures and results in the topos picture in the future. For example,
