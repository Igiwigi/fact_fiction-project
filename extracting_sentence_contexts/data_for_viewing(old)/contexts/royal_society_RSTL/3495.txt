causes no change, these cases including its contact with both lead and the solution of
sulphuret, is it at all probable that its intervention between these two bodies at c
should make a difference equal to double the amount of force previously existing, or
indeed any difference at all ?

1890. Such an alteration as this in the sum assigned as the amount of the forces
belonging to the sulphuret of lead by virtue of its two places of contact, is equivalent
I think to saying that it partakes of the anomalous character already supposed to
belong to certain fluids, namely, of sometimes giving balanced forces in circles of
good conductors, and at other times not (1865.).

1891. Even the metals themselves must in fact be forced into this constrained
condition ; for the effect at a point of contact, if there be any at all, must be the re-
sult of the joint and mutual actions of the bodies in contact. If therefore in the
circuit, fig. 5, the contact forces are not balanced, it must be because of the deficient
Joint action of the lead and solution at e*, If the metal and fluid were to act in their
