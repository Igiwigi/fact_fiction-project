of the 200 diameters rod falls not much below that of the 300 diameters rod, but its
* off” curve is notably different near the conclusion, where the demagnetising influence
of the ends becomes sharply apparent. - The result is to reduce the residual magnetism
to 60 per cent. of the total. In the 150 diameters rod the residual magnetism falls
to 39 per cent., in the 100 diameters rod to 20 per cent., in the 75 diameters rod to
9 per cent., and in the 50 diameters rod to about 6 per cent. The * off” curves of
the shorter rods are distinguished by a long straight descent towards the axis of B,
showing a sensibly uniform rate of demagnetisation during the later parb of the with-
drawal of the externally applied force.

The comparative difficulty of magnetising a short rod is shown by fig. 3 in a way
which requires no comment. If we were to infer values of py and « from the tesb of
the 50 diameters rod, neglecting the fact that the magnetising force due to the
solenoid is not the whole of H, we should find for the maximum of p 656, and for that
of « 52; and these coefficients are much more nearly uniform for various values of the
magnetising force than when we determine them in a legitimate manner by observ-
ing the magnetisation of very long rods or of rings.

$17. From this and other experiments, I concluded that even when dealing with
the softest iron, we may take a rod whose length is not less than 300 diameters 45
giving results scarcely different from those given by a ring or a longer rod, and in gubse-
quent experiments rods were almost exclusively used whose length was from 300 to 400
