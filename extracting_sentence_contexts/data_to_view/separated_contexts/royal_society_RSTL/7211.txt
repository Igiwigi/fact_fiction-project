The assumption that elements enter into compounds with the atomic heats they
have in the free state would be inadmissible, if not only the atomic structure as ex-
pressed by the empirical formula, but also the grouping of the elements to proximate
constituents, as is endeavoured to be expressed by the rational formula, influenced
the atomic heat of the compounds. That the latter is not the case is very probable
from the comparisons made in $ 94, where approximately equal atomic heats were
obtained for compounds of analogous empirical formule, even with the greatest dissi-

milarity of chemical character. That that, which may be supposed and expressed by the

80-called rational formula in reference to the internal constitution of compounds, does

not affect the atomic heat, becomes more probable from the fact that chemically similar,

and even isomorphous compounds, one of which contains an atomic group in the place .
of an individual atom in the other, exhibit dissimilar atomic heats. This is seen, for

instance, in comparing analogous chlorine and cyanogen compounds (Cy=CN); the

latter have far greater atomic heats. Thus the atomic heat
