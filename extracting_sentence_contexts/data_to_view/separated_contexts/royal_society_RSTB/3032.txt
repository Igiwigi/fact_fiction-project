Control experiments were performed by removing one
ovary but not the other, and by destroying some of the corpora lutea, but not all, and
in the majority of instances the animals brought forth young. The results of these
experiments therefore support the view that there is an intimate connection between
the presence of the corpus luteum and the occurrence of pregnancy, and that this
connection in a certain sense is one of cause and effect. Apart from the experimental evidence, FRAENKEL adduces certain other facts
which tend to support his theory. He points out that the general structure of the
corpus luteum is suggestive of its being a ductless gland, that it is formed mainly of
large epithelioid cells arranged in regular rows or columns not unlike those of the
cortex of the supra-renal body and surrounded by a network of capillaries, and that
its inerease in size until it becomes bigger than a mature follicle, is otherwise
inexplicable. This increase, he shows, is out of all proportion to that of the rest of the
ovary, and when the corpus luteum is most hyperemic, the other part of the ovary is
unusually anzemic, while towards the close of pregnancy, when increase in the blood
supply to the generative organs is at its highest, the corpus luteum is frequently
reduced toascar.
