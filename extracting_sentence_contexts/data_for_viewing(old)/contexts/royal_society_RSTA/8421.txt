as significant. Here, however, we have to do with a correlated series, not a random
sample ; the standard error is probably higher, and personally I am inclined to doubt
whether either correlation is really significant. The discrepancies of sign as compared
with the partial correlations for the ungraduated numbers in the case of the third and
fifth partials may alone suffice to raise doubts. In any case, the effect of these correlations
on the continued product of (1 — r*) is extremely small, only reducing the variance of
disturbances from 10-4 to 8-2 per cent. of the total. In this case also there is very little
to be gained by taking into account any terms beyond u,_2, even if that little be
significant.

This result, that terms beyond w,_, hardly come into account if we attempt to estimate
u, by means of the preceding terms is, as it seems to me, what ought to be expected if
the series is in fact “disturbed.” But, in a sense, it is rather disappointing. Fig. 6

shows a graph formed by superposing a series of functions of the form (36), or fig. 5, of
varying amplitudes, a new one starting when the one before reaches its first minimum.
It-will be seen that the graph is very like that of the sunspot numbers. It may be that
this is, or is a close approximation to, the actual function, but when disturbances affect
the movement, it does not seem possible to determine the constants, at least by the
present method. The road seems to be blocked at the first approximation given by
the regression equations of the second order (31) and (32).
