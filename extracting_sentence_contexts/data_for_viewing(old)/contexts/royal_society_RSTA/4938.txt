Already the trace on the H2" is q”. This suggests that Hi(A! , F @ F”) vanishes for i # 2n. We will

now show that this is in fact the case. Here is an equivalent formulation.
The sheaf F @ FY = End(F) has a direct sum decomposition

End(F) = Qe @ End°(F),

in which End°(F) is the subsheaf of endomorphisms of trace zero. The fact that M1,1(F_) =1 is
thus equivalent to

Lemma 6.1. The cohomology groups FAS End*(F)) all vanish.

Proof. Compute the cohomology via the Leray spectral sequence for the projection
