9, ELEVATED TRANSMITTER AND RECEIVER
9-1. The application of ray theory

In the case of a homogeneous earth a particularly simple result with an obvious physical
appeal is that of ray theory, given by (26). From the nature of this formula one might at
first sight be tempted to infer, with respect to the mixed-path problem, that geometrical
optics would be adequate in those regions governed by ray theory not in the immediate
vicinity of OJ (figure 4); but this is by no means entirely the case in the sense in which we
have used these terms. Referring to the inequality (27) we note the perhaps rather surprising
fact that the validity of (26) depends only on the combined heights of the transmitter and
receiver, and not on the angle of elevation y; in consequence, ray theory may easily have
s stressed in §3,

practical application in ground-wave communication, and furthermore, i
may sometimes be linked with the height-gain function. On the other hand, it is well known
that geometrical optics can only give a reasonable approximation at large angles of diffrac-
tion, and generally speaking these fall outside the limits of interest in the propagation
problem.

For a perfectly conducting earth, the exact result is given by ray theory with a reflexion
coefficient of | 1. [tis therefore reasonable to suppose that there will be some approximation
