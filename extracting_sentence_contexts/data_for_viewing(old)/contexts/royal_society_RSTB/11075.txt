haps this is, in addition to having cell walls, why plants are not known to exhibit metastasized neoplasia [22]. These
transitions from live to dead cells are programmed such that resources are recycled and stored for next season’s growth
(in perennials) or packaged in resilient seeds that sprout the next generation in annuals. Plants, unlike animals, do not
have a defined germline, gametogenesis occurs late in tissue development. In theory, somatic mutations can be transmitted
to the next generation as germlines. However, in Arabidopsis, germline cell divisions are independent of both plant age and
vegetative age [63], meaning older plants do not pass along longer or shorter telomeres. Tracing telomeres through successive
generations, [63] found that the shortest telomeres were typically elongated in the subsequent generation, while the longest
telomeres were usually shortened.
