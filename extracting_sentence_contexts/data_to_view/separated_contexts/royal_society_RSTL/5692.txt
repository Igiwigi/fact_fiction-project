T have also
El observed, as before alluded to#, that mustard produces a similar result on the cutaneous
S $ensory nerves, and hence it seems probable that the same is true of the whole class of
= lritants. Again, the diffusion induced by mustard, croton oil, and cantharides indicates,
NZ according to what we have seen to be its most probable explanation, that the nerves of
= the pigment-cells suffer impairment of functional activity under the action of these three
5 Substances. On the other hand, the fact that diffusion is arrested equally with concen-
tration by most irritants, appears to prove that the chromatophorous cells are them-
8lves also affected with loss of power; for, as has been before alluded to, the withdrawal
of nervous influence from them in a healthy state of the tissues invariably gives rise to
Uffusion, and the same result would necessarily follow the action of an irritant which
merely paralysed the nerves. I have also observed, on two occasions, after the energetic
operation of an irritant upon a part of a web containing a large artery, that drawing

+ The main arteries lying between the layers of skin of which the web consists, are not 0 speedily acted
upon by irritants as the capillaries of the dermis. This is most marked in large frogs with thick webs.
