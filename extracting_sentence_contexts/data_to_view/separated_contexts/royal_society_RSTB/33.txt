In the actively
growing seed, the radicle being 2 to 3 inches long, there is little left except the mesh-
work of protoplasm which, now relieved from tension, is seen to be very loose, and to
contain large vacuoles,

AMYLOLYTIC FERMENTS. The manner in which the stored-up cellulose is made use of in the plant has not
been hitherto shown. Beyond the fact that in some seeds there is a large accumula-
tion of it, and that then no starch appears in the reserve materials, but little is
known. Judging from analogy with both starch and proteids, there seems some
likelihood of the action being a ferment action. Some seeds of the Date (Phanix dactylifera) were germinated for me by Mr. Lynou
at the Botanical Gardens, Cambridge.
