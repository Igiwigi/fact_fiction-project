By dealing with the three types of integral (49) to (51) in the same way, we reduce them
to one single set of subsidiary quantities. Hitherto, integrals of different classes were treated
separately, each with its own auxiliary functions. An additional advantage with our present
treatment lies in the fact that no complications arise when the nuclei are of different elements.
