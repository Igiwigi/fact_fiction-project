Mr. W. F. SHepparp suggested that integral curves would afford clearer details. I have not, however,
used them, as the “humpbacked” curves are more familiar to the modern biologist.

156 MR. W. K. SPENCER ON THE EVOLUTION OF THE CRETACEOUS ASTEROIDEA.

spine pits, the amount of the plate which possesses spine pits, the size and form of
protuberances upon the plates, also fail to show any pronounced break ‘in graduation
in character.

In fact, it is clear, from the description of the species given in Section IT, that the
great majority of the variations exhibited in Chalk starfish are of the continuous type.

Discontinuous variations (“ mutations” of DE VrrEs, more properly called saltations)
may occur. Previously it has been explained that both Crateraster quinqueloba, var.
depressus (p. 121), and Metopaster quadratus, var. parvus (p. 117), may be true
saltations. These saltations, however, are lost sight of after a racial life of com-
paratively short duration,

Correlation of Variations.—Vhe fact that variation is continuous is the main cause
of difficulty to the field geologist who wishes to determine zonal horizons, for, unless
a fair amount of material be obtained, it is frequently far from easy to decide
whether the specimens are truly typical of the horizon.
