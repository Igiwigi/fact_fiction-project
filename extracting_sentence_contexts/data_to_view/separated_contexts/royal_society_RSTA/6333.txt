Not only will this rate determine if we have conditions relevant
to equilibrium situations, but macroscopic quantities such as electrical and thermal conduction
depend on this rate. These latter quantities are of vital importance in planetary interiors. Interest in the issue of electron-ion equilibration is further motivated by the fact that short-
pulse laser systems have also been used to extend WDM experiments to the other end of the
temporal scale, for example, Lecherbourg et al. [46] will present results on the evolution of
solid copper into a warm dense matter state, in this case, after excitation with a femtosecond
laser pulse. More recently, and of particular significance to the work in this issue, the advent of
X-ray free-electron lasers has made it possible to achieve volumetric heating on sub-picosecond
timescales [45,47]. Using this property, Ren et al. [48] discuss the application of inner shell
photoionization to creation of a solid density X-ray laser using volumetric pumping with a
free electron laser, with particular attention paid to collisional effects of photo-ejected electrons,
an issue of relevance to volumetric X-ray heating of WDM.
