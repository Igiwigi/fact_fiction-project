neglected for the real part Ker.

The non-Hermiticity of Heg results in a set of complex eigenvalues {€;,} associated with two
distinct sets of eigenvectors called left {(w|} and right {/W%)} eigenvectors Heg| WB) = En |wR)
and (Wh lest = (WHEn, where the complex eigenvalue €; = E, — (i/2)Iq, gives the energy E,, and
the resonance width Ij, > 0 of the nth resonance, respectively. The left and right eigenvectors,
which describe the resonance states, satisfy the condition of bi-orthogonality, (WE|WR) = 61m, and
completeness, )~_, |W) (wE| = 1. In the context of microwave cavities, the validity of model (2.1)
for real x; has been established in previous works [33,34]. More general models of non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian operators may be used to study open quantum systems (e.g. the topical review [25]).
This formalism has been successfully applied to wave billiards for which antennas and absorption
are respectively described by physical and fictitious coupling channels [34-36].

In figure 2, the eigenvalue dynamics measured in microwave cavities are shown for three types
of perturbation, where the perturbation strength is indicate by 4. In figure 2a, the perturbation is
introduced by the shift of a wall in a stadium billiard (for details see [18,37]) corresponding to
a full perturbation matrix V. It is the same kind of perturbation as sketched in figure 1a. As this
perturbation acts on all levels in the same way for already small parameter variations, thus the
dynamics seen in figure 2a is quite homogeneous. For this kind of perturbation the distribution of
level velocities v = dE/da is Gaussian [17,18,37,42]. In figure 2b, a local perturbation is performed
by moving a scatterer with a radius much smaller than the wavelength (for details see [38,39]).
This perturbation can be described by a rank 2 perturbation, i.e. V= W), wi, where W), is a2 x N
