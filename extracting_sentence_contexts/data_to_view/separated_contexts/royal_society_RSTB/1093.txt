Nerve.—In electrical excitation of the nerve, we were chiefly anxious at first to
Svoid possibility of spread. Beginning with ordinary sheathed electrodes, into which
the sciatic nerve was laid, we very soon laid these aside for the more accurate and
Bnpler plan of applying platinum electrodes to the nerve raised in the air by a thread.
20 The mode of exciting a nerve in relation to its cross and long diameter respectively,
as for some time been the object of research (HERMANN, BERNSTEIN, and others). Gap,* in referring to the action of carbonic acid, and especially of alcohol, on the
Excitability and conductivity of nerve fibres, raises this question again, and
‘@rengthens the fact that transverse excitation is much more adequate (5-6 times)
‘han stimulation applied longitudinally. Apart from incidental polarisation it is clear
Bat the larger number of fibres lying in the principal axis between the poles chiefly

Yonditions the result.
= To produce a maximal effect we have, therefore, always applied the platinum
Glectrodes, so as to bend the nerve slightly between the terminal points. (See fig. 3.)

Inasmuch as we always sought to obtain, with as weak an excitation as possible, a
maximal effect for purposes of quantitative as well as qualitative comparison, it was
especially necessary for us to excite, without fail, all the fibres in the nerve. The usual method of simply placing the nerve on the electrodes, as, for instance, in
using sheathed or hook patterns, only enables a few fibres to be excited—those
immediately in contact, or nearly so, with the metal.
