(originally due to MacCuniagu) that the transverse waves involve no compression,
md therefore are independent, as regards their propagation, of the term in the
ergy which involves compression. He assumes that in the act of reflexion and
tion no compressional waves are produced ; and that this is so because extra-
us forces act on the interface just in such manner as to establish the continuity of
“Stress across it, while on account of the conservation of the energy they can do no
ork in the actual motion of the medium at the interface. The explicit recognition
of such forces constitutes Kircuuorr’s principle ; as to their origin he says that it lies
i a traction exerted by the matter on the ether which is unbalanced at the surface of
d ntinuity, and that they are somehow of the same nature as the capillary force at
interface between two liquids; as to their happening to be precisely such as will
tinguish the compressional waves, he merely says that it must be so, because as a
tter of fact no compressional waves are produced by the reflexion, the energy being
umed to be all in the reflected and refracted light-waves. On the other hand, the
elastic theory has been worked out on Neumann’s hypothesis, for the simple
of an isotropic medium, without the assumption of these extraneous forces, by
ORENZ, Lord RAyueicH, and others, and has been shown to lead to loss of light
