1-5 where $ is the flow along any line in a plane through the axis of z up to the point in
ES question. It is a function depending in general on the path of integration, but þ is
Z independent of this (is in fact due to the added irrotational motion) and is single

valued when y is 80. When y is many-valued (as, for instance, in the case of

Pulzations), þ—Ay is single-valued.
