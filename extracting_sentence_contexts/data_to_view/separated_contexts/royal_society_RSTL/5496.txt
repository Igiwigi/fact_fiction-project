This is seen immediately to be the case when #=0, and may be easily verified in
other simple cases, such as 4=1, n=2, &c. PROFESSOR DONKIN ON THE EQUATION OF LAPLACE'S FUNCTIONS, BTC. 49

9. In fact, the process of art. 2 gives

U,=Til =O co OD Ty m4 ms

where ,_,, satisfies the equation
(w,_u7_, wy +(1—mY—P)n,-u= 0;
and in general we can only arrive at an integrable form by taking m==n. But when +7
is an integer not greater than 2, we shall get an integrable form by taking m 8 as to
satisfy the condition (4—m)*=7?. Suppose 7 poxitive and less than n, and take m=1u—7 ;
we then have for the solution of (19.),
U,=ZRP 1 T1 Us

where u; satisfies the equation @_ay=0, or
(ﬆn 05 —+7 cos 0) (ﬆin 05 —icos 0) w=0:
the integration of this is easy, and the result is
VE: WY.
