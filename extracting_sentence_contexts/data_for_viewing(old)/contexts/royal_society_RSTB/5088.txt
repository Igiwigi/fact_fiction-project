animals covering a wide range of adaptation: some of the genera contain primitively
aquatic animals which show no signs of ever having possessed terrestrial ancestors ;
others are clearly land-living, and a further large group is composed of Amphibia which
have returned to life in the water. Despite these diverse habits, the fundamental
morphology of the skeleton is strikingly uniform throughout the group.

That the Embolomeri are related to the Rachitomi, the Permian grade of the Laby-
rinthodonts, is made clear by the identical pattern of their skull roof and the similar
range in head form. The remarkable and complex structure of the lower jaw is the same
in both groups, and detailed resemblances between those parts of the skeleton which, in
later Labyrinthodonts, do not exhibit evolutionary changes can be multiplied.

But far more impressive than these formal resemblances is the fact that in every
respect their structure forms a logical starting point for the series of evolutionary changes
which procure regularly with time in the Permian and Triassic Labyrinthodonts.

To use the technicality which is becoming universal amongst paleontologists, the
evolutionary trends in accordance with which later Labyrinthodont evolution took
place were already established in Carboniferous times.

The Carboniferous Labyrinthodonts of the grade Embolomeri have in common the
following features :â€”

The skull is high.
