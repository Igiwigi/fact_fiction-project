Moreover, the work of Fabre and Lederer on
the green and the red Actinia shows that different colour varieties may differ in their
carotenoids. In Metridium senile the variation of hue even in the red variety is great
enough to suggest that more than one pigment may be concerned in different cases,
and our observations will show that this is indeed the case. This fact raised for us a
great practical difficulty. If individual varieties vary in their carotenoids, one can
no longer be content with results obtained from large masses of material. Single
individuals or collections restricted to the same asexual stock must be used, and the
quantity of pigment available for accurate investigation is correspondingly diminished.
