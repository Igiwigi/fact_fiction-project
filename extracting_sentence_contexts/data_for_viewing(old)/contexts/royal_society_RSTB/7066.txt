present work, but the responses from the oestrous and oestrogenized uteri were very similar
to those described and depicted by Haterius & Ferguson for the post-partum organ. The
endocrine state in some post-partum rodents appears to be similar in many ways to that
of oestrus, as shown by the regularity with which mice and rats and non-suckling post-
partum rabbits come into oestrus within a few days of delivery. Therefore, the similarity
of the responses of the oestrous and post-partum uteri to stimulation of the pituitary is
hardly surprising. : -

It is difficult at first sight to see any physiological significance underlying the fact that
the rabbit possesses a means for increasing the activity of the empty oestrous uterus, a means
that involves a nervous and glandular transmission of stimuli. One possible function served
by this mechanism may be the transportation of spermatozoa from the vagina to the
uterine cavity during and after coitus. It is generally admitted that coitus in the rabbit
stimulates the activity of the adenohypophysis by a reflex pathway through the hypo-
thalamus and infundibular stem. It seems likely that the neurohypophysis may be stimu-
lated by a similar nervous reflex and that the resulting uterine activity may, by the creation
of negative pressure waves, assist in the transmission of seminal fluid. That stimulation of
the neurohypophysis occurs during coitus is rendered probable by the work of Verney and
his colleagues, who showed that emotional stress causes liberation of at least the anti-
diuretic hormone from this gland, and it cannot be doubted that an emotional disturbance
is the normal accompaniment of coitus and the orgasm. Reynolds (19304) showed that
