importance can be attached to their presence or absence ; and their mode of origin in
Lucifer certainly gives no 8upport to the view that they have been produced, like the
mandibles, by the gradual specialisation of a pair of ordinary appendages. They do
not rezemble ordinary appendages at any stage, but are formed directly, and the fact
that the period of their development is spread over several moults renders their
history quite different from that of the appendages. As I shall show further on,

gerially homologous organs do not necessarily owe their resemblances to inheritance
from the unspecialised organs of a remote ancestor, and I think that the presence of a
distinet occular 8egment in Squilla compels us to recognise an homology between the
stalked eye and an ordinary appendage, although it, is no doubt true that all the
groups in which stalked eyes occur cannot be traced back to a common stalked-eyed
ancestor, and also true that the stalked eyes themselves cannot be traced back to
ordinary appendages. The ocellus.
