body of the tables are found from those nearer the periphery by use of simple recursion
formulae. Finally, the Z’s of higher m value are found from the P’s and G’s, using equations
such as (24). The peripheral entries needed in the first stage of the evaluation of Z,, 74, are

(a) the G, ,,, in which vy = 0, —-l andA=0,1 ...ym+l; the P, ,,, in which y= 0, —1
and A= 0,1...,m+/—1.

(b) the G, .,. These are needed only if n>/+1 and then v must assume the values
v=0,1...,n—/—1, for G, _,, and v = 0,1, ....n—l for G, ,.

On account of the fact, mentioned in §2 that the analytical expressions for all the ¢,,,,
functions change when t=7, the peripheral entries must be obtained by adding the
corresponding integrals in (17) and (18), over the ranges (0,7) and (7, 00). This is a very
annoying, but inescapable, complication. We may conveniently represent the contributions
from the lower and upper ranges by superscripts 7 and s, so that

G a (Ks 7) = Gi ry(k,7) +G514(k, 7) (25a)

The separate partial range integrals can be expressed quite simply in terms of certain
