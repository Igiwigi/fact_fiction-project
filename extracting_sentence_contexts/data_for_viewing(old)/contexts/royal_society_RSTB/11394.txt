assume at least some role for somatosensory, interoceptive (b) Boy-band and somatic markers

and motor content [12]. In fact, the basic idea that emotional
thoughts are linked to the body is old. William James pro-
vided the canonical example of a bottom-up link: we know
that we ‘fear’ a bear by perceiving changes in our own
bodily state [13]. He also highlighted the top-down links, as
in his famous quote that ‘every representation of a movement
awakens in some degree the actual movement which is its
object’ [14, p. 256]

Importantly, in modern theories actual peripheral
changes are not necessary for ‘bodily’ contributions to an
emotion. Instead, these theories focus on neural resources
for somatosensory and motor processing [15]. Indeed,
