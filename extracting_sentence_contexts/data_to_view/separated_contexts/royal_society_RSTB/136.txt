There would be no gill slits in Mammalian embryos, no pineal gland in Vertebrates. The science of Embryology would be of little value to us. We know that this tendency may be overcome, by the fact that many stages in
ancestral history, many organs and structures undoubtedly possessed by ancestors,
disappear. But what causes govern the obscuration or disappearance of these organs,
structures, and stages, we do not, in most cases, know with any degree of certainty. Turning now to the stages represented in the various phases of segmentation and
the morula.
