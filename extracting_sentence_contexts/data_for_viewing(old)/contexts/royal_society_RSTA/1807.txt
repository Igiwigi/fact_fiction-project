rotational superradiance, the scatterer must be a rotating object.!
— The system needs to provide an absorption mechanism.

One interesting system to satisfy these conditions are rotating black holes (BHs). Indeed, the
ergosphere provides a mechanism to allow for the presence of negative energy and the event
horizon acts as a perfect absorber. It was indeed shown, soon after Zel’Dovich’s seminal paper,
that rotating BHs can be the stage of the superradiance effect [7-9]. Since then, a long list of
systems spanning the various fields of physics have been found to exhibit this effect, and some
others are still being looked for. Among them are water waves on a cylinder [10], orbital angular
momentum beam incident on a disc [11-14], or binary BHs [15].

Following a long history of theoretical studies, the rotational superradiance effect was recently
observed in the Nottingham experiment [1]. This experiment, motivated by the stunning fact
that, under specific conditions, waves propagating on a flowing fluid experience the presence of an
effective curved space-time [16,17], was based on multiple theoretical studies of superradiance in
analogue systems [18-24]. However, even with this whole array of studies, a complete theoretical
description of the superradiance experiment is still missing. This is due to the various effects
present in this experiment, the main ones being dispersion and vorticity, which even make the
determination of effective governing equations a difficult task. The effect of vorticity on shallow
water flows has been studied in [25,26] while dispersive effects in irrotational flows have been
investigated in [27]. In this paper, built upon the work in [27], we use a Wentzel-Kramers—
Brillouin (WKB) approximation to predict the reflection coefficient spectrum to be compared with
the experimental results of [1]. The paper is organized as follows: in §2, we briefly review the
work of [27] in order to establish the notation and make the present-study self-consistent. In §3,
we derive the connection formula that relates WKB modes on both side of a saddle point. In §4,
