We thus have the third or posterior part of the cingulum in its entire extent
reaching from behind the forceps major above, down to the anterior part of the
temporo-sphenoidal lobe below. In this extent its size does not vary much, except
that at the lower part it swells out before finally tapering off.

In sections still further removed from the middle line the fibres of the cingulum are
intercepted in the isthmus of the gyrus fornicatus by another band of fibres. These
come from that part of the corpus callosum which is known as the forceps major
(fig. 11, F.M.), and which is situated between the main body of the corpus callosum
above and the upper end of the cortex of the hippocampal or uncinate convolution
below, and just anterior to the descending fibres of the cingulum, from which latter
it can be distinguished by its oblique direction downwards and backwards, and by
the fact that its fibres are stained a much deeper colour than the cingulum.

These fibres of the forceps major (fig. 12, /.M.) course downwards and slightly
backwards through the outer fibres of the cingulum, which they cross at an oblique
angle, and their dark stained fibres (with Wercert’s method) are in marked contrast
to the paler fibres of the cingulum. (See corpus callosum, p. 170.)

After this decussation of the two sets of’ fibres, the cingulum diminishes very much
in size and only its lower end remains.
