Unless detonation can build up from a very small local disturbance, no special sensi-
tization by grit is to be expected. Two interesting points arise. In the first place, the usefulness of Service azide lies precisely
in the fact that it builds up to complete detonation in very small volumes. Any attempt to
preserve this property of an initiator has almost inevitably the concomitant of a high grit
sensitiveness, if the proposed theory of grit sensitiveness is correct. Secondly the heat of
explosion/g. of lead azide and mercury fulminate are stated to be (Escales & Stettbacher
1917) .
