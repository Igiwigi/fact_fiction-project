IMMS ON THE STRUCTURE AND BIOLOGY OF ARCHOTERMOPSIS.

be kept alive, and apparently healthy, for several weeks, and their sole nutriment _
consists of rectal matter ejected by their fellows. This material is re-devoured again
and again, until all nourishment has been abstracted therefrom. At this stage,
unless fresh food be supplied, the imprisoned Termites die of starvation, A micro-
scopical examination of the rectal matter, immediately after ejection through the
anus, reveals the fact that Protozoa are present therein. It is, therefore, evident how
these latter organisms are transmitted from one individual to another. The work of absorbing the wood particles is discharged by Trichonympha and
Trichomonas in the case of Archotermopsis.
