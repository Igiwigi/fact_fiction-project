Thus, in the instance of the Tri-
dent (24) and (25), sailing from Greenhithe to Rio Janeiro : -suppose that there had
been no good opportunity of making observations of azimuth on the voyage; on the
$hip's arrival at Rio Janeiro, the table of deviations formed at Greenhithe would have
been found erroneous by 6? or 7* in one direction with head eastward, and erroneous
by 8? or 9* in the opposite direction with head westward. But if the compass had
been corrected by magnets and soft iron at Greenhithe, it would have been correct
at Rio Janeiro without an error approaching to a single degree. The change of
compass-deviation, in fact, has been produced, not by the change of the ship's s8ub-
permanent magnetism (which has been sensibly constant), but by the change in the
magnitude of the earth's directive magnetism, which change has altered the proportion
of the ship's invariable magnetism to the earth's variable magnetism ; and if this pro-
portion had been reduced to zero by neutralization of the ship's magnetism by means
of magnets, the variation of the proportion as depending on the variation of the
earth's magnetism would also have been destroyed. What has been said in regard
to the errors arising during the whole voyage, applies, in a proportionate degree, to

the errors arising during a part of the voyage: if there had been valid observations
