Our requirements for on demand access to large-scale computing
resources for such purposes are well known and have informed numerous initiatives across the
world to provide appropriate access mechanisms for medical and clinical research. This is part of



the core business of the Computational Biomedicine Centre of Excellence (www.compbiomed.eu)
which has innovation and sustainability at its heart. As a matter of fact, the EasyVVUQ software
which we have introduced as an open-source toolkit, and as part of the VECMA Toolkit [30], is
based on its original applications to MD as discussed here. It is now being applied widely in many
fields of concern to this theme issue of Phil Trans A, from fluid dynamics to climate prediction
and fusion energy research. As such, it can be reasonably considered that the study of uncertainty
quantification in MD is now beginning to have an impact within the wider general field of VVUQ.
