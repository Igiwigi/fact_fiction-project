somewhat of this type is found in the tropics in the mangrove swamps fringing the
coast in many places, while the more northernly marshes are usually devoid of trees.”

It is generally agreed that the presence of salt in the soil inhibits the free absorption
of water by the roots,{ and the plants are almost invariably xeromorphic. Now one
of the commonest structural peculiarities found in salt-marsh plants is the great
reduction of their intercellular spaces. The leaves of a large number of plants
growing in mangrove swamps and on English and North American salt marshes, whose
structure has been examined, illustrate this fact. In the case of Acrostichum awreum, however, there is a fairly well developed
lacunar system in the mesophyll,§ though the plant flourishes at some distance from
the sea, and there may be little actual salt in the soil. If it is the case, as seems
probable, that the presence of salt in the soil brings about a reduction in the air
spaces of the mesophyll, the evidence derived from the Calamites is not favourable to
the salt-marsh-habitat theory, for, as has been shown, the lacunar system is often
remarkably well developed.
