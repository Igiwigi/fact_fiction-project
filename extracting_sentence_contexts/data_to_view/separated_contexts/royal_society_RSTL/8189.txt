Cloxely associated with the stems jast described are considerable
S mumbers of smaller ones of yarious dimensions, including mere twigs, like that repre-
sented in Plate LV. fig. 40. The structure in all these 8maller stems is s0 exactly
identical with the large ones in every respect, save in the more cylindrical form and in
the shape of the yascular bundle, that, eyen had we no direct proof of the fact, there
could be no doubt as to their being portions of the same plant. Plate L,VI. fig. 39
represents one of the larger examples of this form. The central yascular bundle (4) exhibits a crescentic section with incurved angles and
Vith three light tooth-like projections in the interior of the concave margin.
