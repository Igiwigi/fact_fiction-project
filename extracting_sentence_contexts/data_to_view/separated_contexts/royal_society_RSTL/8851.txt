This is a North-American species, closely related to, if not identical with, the form
into which the Axolotl changes when its metamorphosis is complete. The whole appearance of the skull is changed ; it is altogether neater, more solid,
and its narrowed, more elongate form is much more like that of a Frog. In fact it has undergone changes quite similar to those which the skull of a meta-
morphosing Frog undergoes in passing from the short-tailed condition to that of the
adult. Nevertheless the adult skull of the Caducibranchiate Urodeles and that of the
Batrachia are very different ; the former types belong to a lower and more Jateral fork
than the latter, but both are terminal or culminating. There is no inosculation.
