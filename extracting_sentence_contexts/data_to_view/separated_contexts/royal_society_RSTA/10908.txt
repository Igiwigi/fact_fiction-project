Here we may conjecture that enough fluid is left to fill up the inter-
stices, but that the coat is not thick enough to shear easily. If, however, the
sphere be thoroughly dried the splash becomes “rough” again. This gives us the
explanation of the facts already recorded in respect of the splash of a wet sphere
(Series VII. of Paper I.). This splash was always irregular ; the liquid drifted to one
side where it would shear, while it disappeared from the other or became there too
thin to shear, though sufficient to fill up crevices.
