though we recognize the caution needed in interpreting these
relationships given the likelihood of prokaryoteâ€”prokaryote
LGT transfer [52].

3. The majority of putative interdomain latera
gene transfers appear to be recent events

Inspection of the 1138 genes that match our criteria for putative
interdomain LGT reveal a striking pattern as over half of
the putative interdomain LGTs (606 of 1138) involve only
one minor clade nested within one major clade of eukaryotes
(e.g. metazoa (Op_me) or ciliates (Sr_ci); table 2 and electronic
supplementary material, S2). In fact, the greatest number
of interdomain LGTs in this category are found in only
one minor clade within the Opisthokonta (290 genes),
Archaeplastida (170 genes) and then SAR (Stramenopila +
Alveolata + Rhizaria; 59 genes; table 3). To exemplify this
pattern, we include an example of one of the resulting trees
for a putative carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase enzyme
(OG5_141348 from OrthoMCL), which is found only in bac-
teria, archaea and animals (figure 1). The large number
of interdomain LGTs into fungi (196 inferred; figure 2; elec-
tronic supplementary material, table S1) is consistent with
numerous studies [15,53], but a broader comparison of our
data with published cases of putative LGT is not easily done
