Nonne antea particularum nexus putredinis quodam
« gradu fuerit relazatus? Certe, nisi_ compages quodammodo mutatur, quodlibet
« pondus incumbens huic effectui erit impar. Ceterim idem observatur phznomenon
« in omni schislo argillaceo.” This is certainly a yery curious fact ; and the learned
Professor, with his usual acuteness, rejects the idea that mere weight can have been the
cause. As a farther proof also, he afterwards observes, © Orthoceratitz, que in sfrato
* calcareo conicam figuram perſecte servant, in schisto planum fere triangulare com-
« pressione efſiciunt. Idem valet de piscibus, conchis, insectisque petrefactis.” And
again, © Observatu quoque dignum est, quod idem reperiatur effectus, quamvis
« sfratum calcareum $ub schisto collocatum sit, et majori ideo pondere comprimente
« onustum.” De Productis Volcaniis, p. 240, It is evident, therefore, that weight
alone has not produced this effect; and BerGmann's idea, that the solidity of the
vegetable bodies may have undergone some previous change, in the manner of inci-
pient putrefaction, by moisture, and by becoming heated in the mass, must be allowed
to be very probable.
