Unfortunately, the head of the young Fish had been removed before it was put, int |
our hands, 80 that i was impossible for us to determine whether the pronephros was +
still present ; but as we shall subsequently show, the section of the 8egmental duct,
originally present between the pronephros and the front end of the permanent kidney T
or mesonephros, has in any case disappeared. S |

In addition to an examination of the excretory organs in situ, which showed little i
except the presence of the generative ridges, we made a complete xeries of sectiong |
through the excretory organs for their whole length (Plate 26, figs. 54-57). i

Posteriorly these sections showed nothing worthy of note, the excretory organs and |
their ducts differing in no important particular from these organs as we haye described
them in the adult, except in the fact that the segmental ducts are not joined by the
oviducts.

Some little way in front of the point where the two segmental ducts coalesce to
form the urinary bladder, the genital ridge comes into view. For its whole extent,
except near its anterior part (of which more hereafter) this ridge projects freely into
the body-cavity, and in this respect the young Fish differs entirely from the adult. As
shown in Plate 26, figs. 56 and 57 (g.v.), it is attached to the abdominal wall on the
ventral side of, and near the inner border of each kidney. The genital ridge itself
has a structure very similar to that which js characteristic of young Elasmobranchii,
and it may be presumed of young Fishes generally. The free edge of the ridge is
swollen, and this part constitutes the true generative region of the ridge, while its
dorsal portion forms the supporting mesentery. The ridge itself is formed of a central
