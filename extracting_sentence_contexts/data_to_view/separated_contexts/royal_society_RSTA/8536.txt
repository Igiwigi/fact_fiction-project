Ordinarily, w is or can be expressed in terms of the 6's,
and we do not find its improved value independently, but deduce it from those of the
és up to, The improved value of 4, is, by (iii),

(e,); = (Ay apoot Ar ajyort --- HAA) 53 ee ee (40)

and the m.pp.e. that we really require are therefore the values of (,,,);. With
regard to this, see §9.

(v.) As the converse of (XIX.) it may be noted that—

(XXL) A quantity of the conjugate set, or a l.c. of such quantities, cannot be
improved by means of the non-corresponding quantities of the original set ; e.g.,
a Le. of ¢; and o, cannot be improved by using the 0's, other than 4, and 4, as
auxiliaries. This follows from (IX.) of §6, since the m.p.e. of 6, and o, is 0
unless 7 = s.

(vi.) If, as in § 5, there are related conjugate sets of w’s and y’s, and the d's are the
differences of the w’s, it follows from § 5 (v.) that (=) in (ii.) above is a le. of the
moments of the y's up to the j. (XIX.) is therefore a generalisation of the
theorem, for a self-conjugate set, that the improved values are l.cc. of the moments ;
and, in fact, it explains the appearance of the moments in this connexion,

9. Mean Products of Error of Improved Values.—(i.) We have found, in § 8 (iv.),
that

To obtain the \’s, we introduce the condition that this shall differ from d, by a Le.
