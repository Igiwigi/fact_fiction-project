A full account of the properties
actually demonstrable in snch an arrangement is given in the paper (pp. 54 and 55). It corresponds in the most important respects, as regards the distribution of electrical
tension, with Professor MuNK's account of the electrical properties of the resting leaf.

$5 relates to the © Mechanism of the Excitatory Motion.” On this subject it will
be suficient to state that the account given by Profeszor MUNK of the way in which
the leaf closes when touched, agrees with the explanation originally given by Bators
of the mechanism of the motion of the sensitive plant ; namely, that the immediate
cause of the change of form is the sudden passing of certain cells (in the case of Dionza
those of the upper (inner) layer of the lamina and midrib) from the state of distension
into that of flaccidity ; but, in addition to this, there is, he says, an active lengthening
and extension of the cells of the lower or external layer.* From the context it
appears that all that is here meant is that the water discharged in the sndden
relaxation of the cells of the inner (upper) stratum, finds its way at once to the onter
(lower). At all events, the only evidence given in support of active extension is the
fact, proved by measurement, that two marks on the external surface of the expanded
leaf, in a line parallel to the veining and at a measured distance from each other, are
found to be further apart after the leaf has closed (p. 117). In $6 (p. 128) the author approaches the question which more immediately concerns
our present, purpose, viz. : the electrical phenomena which result from excitation. I
will endeavour to give an account, first of the experiments, and secondly of the theo-
retical explanations—premising that, in this as in the section on the electromotive
properties of the unexcited leaf, observations and theories are 80 mixed that it requires
much patience to separate them.
