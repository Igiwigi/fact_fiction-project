appropriate interpretation will require a multiplicity correction (e.g. Bonferroni or false discovery
rate analysis). We believe that the value of our results, however, lies not in finding a few very
significant ones, but in having available results that are poised to answer specific questions with
as little bias as currently possible in observational research.

(d) Improving our study

While our choice of methods to address confounding (data-driven propensity score matching)
and residual bias (CI calibration) can be considered the current best practice, future studies could
replace these with improved methods. One possible direction could be the use of self-controlled
designs such as the self-controlled case series [41]. Other possible future additions include
estimation of absolute risk (instead of relative risk) to better facilitate benefit-risk assessment,
as well as evaluating effect heterogeneity across subpopulations. In fact, we sincerely hope that
observational researchers will move their focus from performing one-off studies to refining the
high-throughput approach as described in this paper. Rather than each researcher working in
isolation, we hope the scientific community will come together to build the process that generates
evidence. To facilitate this, we have made all software necessary to execute this study available as
open source (https: / /github.com/OHDSI/StudyProtocols/tree/master /LargeScalePopEst).

5. Conclusion

We propose a paradigm shift in how researchers generate and disseminate evidence from
observational data. The current paradigm centres on generating one estimate at a time using a
unique study design with unknown operating characteristics and publishing estimates one at a
time through a dissemination process with clear limitations. The new paradigm advocates for
