1. Introduction

Twenty-five years of research on the role of biodiversity in ecosystem processes
and services has yielded an impressive body of literature. Generalizing over
several hundred studies, there is clear evidence that the loss of biodiversity
from a certain trophic group of species results in their reduced biomass pro-
duction, associated with reduced efficiency of resource capture [1-3]. This
relationship has been primarily observed in communities of autotrophs such
as plants [4—7], but also holds in consumers of plant or animal resources
[8-10] and decomposers feeding on dead organic material [11,12]. In fact, the
loss of biodiversity across trophic levels has been predicted to show even stron-
ger effects owing to the strong connection between consumer-resource energy
fluxes and ecosystem processes [2,13,14]. The primary focus of BEF research has
been on bivariate relationships between biodiversity and a single ecosystem
process [1,4], but recent studies have provided strong evidence that the real
functional importance of biodiversity lies in maintaining multiple ecosystem
processes across environmental fluctuations in time or space [5,15]. The effects
of biodiversity loss are rapidly seen when multiple functions are monitored
