chamois leather.

+ This method was first nsed by Ecknarvr (Beitrige zur Anat. und Phys., Giessen, 1858-4, p. 28),
afterwards by PrLiiGer (*Blektrotonus,' p. 394) and by yon BuzoLD (*Erregung der Nerven und Muskeln,”

| effects varied in kind and degree.* Heramorrz' hypothesis undoubtedly accounts
for 8ome of these apparent contradictions, which may be due to the fact that when a
proximal region, or series of points, in a nerve is submitted to the polar action of a
given electrode, there exists a distal region, or series of points, in that nerve which is
submitted to polar influence of the opposite 8ign to that of the electrode (using the
| terms © distal ” and © proximal” with reference to the electrode as centre).
But if this hypothesis is true in the case of the polarising current, it must hold
| als for the testing current, whether galvanic or induced, since the laws of diffusion
are the same for both, and one cannot ensure the coincidence of excitation and polari-
S «ation by separate electrodes. Another contingency capable of vitiating the results
AQ obtained by this same method is, that derived currents may be established through
S the testing electrode of sufficient strength to alter the irritability of the nerve. We
adopted the theory of a mixed polar action for both polarising and testing currents,
as a working hypothesis ab the beginning of our experiments, relying upon the
