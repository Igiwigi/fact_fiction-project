Z only in a secondary and incidental manner.
2 In the peritoneal space of the Sipunculide there exists a large volume of opalescent
Z fluid, holding in snspension corpuscles of definitive organization ; and yet the bulk
= and basis of this fluid also is salt water (figs. 6 and 7). 'They exhibit a pink hue, like

> They are flattened, irregularly oval cells, bearing a single minute nucleus. These
Z cells, in fact, correspond in every minute particular of colour, structure, figure and
2 dimensions, to those found in the blood-vessels of the same Sipuncle. Wherefore this
FI identity? The question cannot be eluded. They must be one and the same. Evyapo-

E The morphotic elements of the fluid of the peritoneal cavity of Asterias rubens,

Y (fig. 8), jagged and broken in many instances, nucleated and perfectly organized in

S the group being enveloped in an involucrum, from the circumference of which
thready appendages project. These latter cells are Nor sperm-cells; the thready
processcs are accidental formations, depending upon the fibrillation of the contents of
the cells; in some examples the threads occur under the character of a flattened pro-
jection or bulging of the involucrum. A © molecular basis ” may also be observed
