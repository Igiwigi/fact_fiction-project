of observations made under favourable conditions, and not redetermined until some
known change is made in the apparatus. Whether this is satisfactory or not depends
on the special circumstances of each installation. It would not be wholly satisfactory
at Kew, where the discharge tube is long and may develop a sag or have to be
replaced. An incidental advantage of regular absolute observations is the check they
afford on the working of the apparatus. They help to disclose defects such as poor
insulation, and secure more careful attention to the electrograph. One of the reasons
for observing potential at 2- as well as 1-metre height, was the fact that the discharge
x, tube of the water-dropper is fully 3 metres above ground level. There is little
& experimental information as to the differences that may exist in the potential gradient

& the height interval from which the standard potential gradient should be obtained.
