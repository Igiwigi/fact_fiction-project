I am fully con-
vinced, however, that no other method will succeed. It is upon this plan that the
solution of the problem is conducted in this paper. It will be seen, that by selecting
a peculiar law of dissection the calculation is very greatly simplified, and made to
depend entirely and solely upon a knowledge of the elevations and depressions, in
fact, the general contour of the surface. This information for some part of the mass
is already supplied by the maps of the Trigonometrical Survey. 11.
