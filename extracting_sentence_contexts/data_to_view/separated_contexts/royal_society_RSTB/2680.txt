The exhaustion is very complete, no zymogen granules being found in any part
of the section, and a very large proportion of the whole tissue of the gland has
undergone the change into islet tissue. A few alveoli retain their identity, and a
large number can be seen in various stages of conversion. The condition of the
whole gland, in fact, is very similar to that of the small portion of dog's pancreas
shown in fig. 5. Scattered in this transitional tissue are several fully formed islets
of the resting type, which were presumably present before the injection of secretin. This specimen was obtained from a winter toad.
