That the particles hold their own to a great extent in all the results is mani-
fest, by the consideration that they have an inherent power or force, the crystalline
force, which is 80 unchangeable that no treatment to which they can be subjected
can alter it ; that it is this very force which, placing the particles in a regular po-
sition in the mass, enables them to act jointly on the magnet or the electric current,
and affect or be affected by them ; and that if the particles are not s0 arranged, but
are in all directions in the mass, then the sum of their forces externally is nothing,
and no inductive exertion of the magnet or current can develope the slightest trace of
the phenomena.

2578. And that particles even before crystallization can act in some degree at a
distance, by virtue of their crystallizing force, is, I think, shown by the following

fact. A jar containing about a quart of solution of sulphate of soda, of such strength
as to erystallize when cold by the touch ofa crystal of the salt or an extraneous body,
was left, accidentally, for a week or more unattended to and undisturbed. The solution
remained fluid ;.
