A similar arrangement of fine nerve-
Abres has been demonstrated in connexion with other capillary vessels of the frog. Lhese fine nerve-fibres are very distinct in several of my specimens.

2 T have indeed observed, in my paper published in the Transactions for 1863, contrary
Â£0 the statements of most anatomists, that capillary vessels generally are freely supplied
Sith nerves, but the latter and their nuclei have been regarded as connective-tissue
Abres and connective-tissue corpuscles; I have shown in certain specimens that, of the
two fibres resulting from the 8ubdivision of a dark-bordered fibre, one was distributed to
the fibres of voluntary muscle, while the other ramified over the vessels supplying the
muscle (Plate XXII. fig. 15). These facts, it need scarcely be aid, are of great import-
ance with reference to the mechanism of nervous action. IT have not succeeded in demonstrating lymphatic vessels in the papille of the frog's
tongue. Besides the various nuclei described, there are several round, oval, and variously-
shaped bodies, about the size of a frog's blood-corpuscle, which are composed princi-

pally of minute oil-globules and granules.
