Much is said of the physiognomic value of a high
forehead, and little store is placed on fulness of the lower and back part of the head ;
but the artistic value of apparent occipital development is easily demonstrated by draw-
ing a profile and varying the limiting line of the lower part of the skull behind. The
* change of one line at this part may be made to convert an intelligent-looking head into
that of a weak-minded person, without alteration of a single feature of the face. The
anatomical fact which the change of line indicates is an arrest of development of the
whole brain, whether large or small, leaving the cranial curvature incomplete. 164 DR. J. CLELAND
