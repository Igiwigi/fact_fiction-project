1) it is seen that the
real depth of the tooth (that is, of that portion which is formed by dentine) is much less
than it appears from a merely outward inspection. * It rests, in fact, on an eleyated
plateau of the dentary bone (fig. 1, c), which has exactly the same outlines as the tooth
itself, and the substance of which passes 80 gradually into that of the tooth that it is
only by the difference in the shade of colour that the boundary between osseous
base and dentinal crown is indicated. This anchylosis, however, is limited to the cir-
cumference of the base of the tooth ; for its central parts are separated from the bone by
the extensive but shallow pulp-cavity (fig. 1, 5).
