Our goal is to simultaneously determine the functions {/n(q, ppv yl

The fact that the asymptotic expansion N+) is an approximation of a non-laminar wave is
established by the following theorem, which has a central role in the current analysis of the water
wave problem, and is stated and proved in [8].

Theorem. Let g, po and y be fixed, A, be defined as the solution of (3.7) and Q* be given by (3.5).
There exist specific sets of functions (nq DRE and constants {Qox}N, such that the function
neN+D(q, p; b) defined in (4.2) satisfies the system (4.5), under the constraint that the hydraulic head Q is

given by (4.1).

Furthermore, the details of the proof presented in [8] suggest that the theorem is true for
a larger class of vorticities. This class is described through an appropriate change of variables,
which reduces the complexity of the proof to the one for the constant-vorticity case; for candidate
