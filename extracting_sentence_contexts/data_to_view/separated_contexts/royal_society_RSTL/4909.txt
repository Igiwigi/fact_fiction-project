In these genera, therefore, the fluid con-
tents of this cavity receive no direct admixture of salt water through the tentacles, for
the extremities of these organs are not perforate. It is replenished only through the
stomach ; the water is submitted to the agency of this organ before it enters into the
visceral chamber. This fact explains the circumstance, that in these molluscoid
polypes the fluid of the visceral cavity, as compared with that of the former group,
presents a higher organic composition ; its cells are corpusculated and evidently
organized; many bear globules of oleine, although comprising several individual
forms of cell; they are consfant in their microscopic characters in the same species. The fluid is aGrated in the tentacles. It is true-blood in its composition and func-
