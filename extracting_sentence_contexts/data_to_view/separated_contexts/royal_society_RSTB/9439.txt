If we assume that this process is much faster than the trans-
mission process and that very high parasite loads eventually
lead to host death, the host will die before infecting another
host and is thus epidemiologically irrelevant. We call this
case ultrainfection as it cannot be considered within the
superinfection—co-infection framework. The drawback of allowing ultrainfection is that some
parameter sets might result in genotypes that do not reach
a steady state in any class, such that the between-host
dynamics would be in fact governed by an effective
number of genotypes n’ smaller than n. To avoid these
‘shadow genotypes’, one solution is to force the steady state
in single infections to be both positive and stable. When a
susceptible is infected by only one genotype, let us say k,
the infected steady-state parasite load is then x4, and its
value is given by equation (2.6) applied for n = 1,

Given that @ > 0, the single-infection parasite load is positive

and stable if and only if (for the proof of the stability, see

electronic supplementary material, appendix C.4)

As the effect of PG on self and its production rate are both
assumed to be positive, this implies that the self-
density-dependent effect is negative (mx <0).
