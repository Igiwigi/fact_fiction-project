Notwithstanding this parallelism of aim, the importance of the results is different. .

In the life-table we have to deal predominantly with the observations of a natural
phenomeuon, independent of human will. Not so with the case of fertility, which—
partly, at least—is also influenced by voluntary causes, But since the phenomena of —
the voluntary order have also their regular course, and since the real effect of the law q
of population is finally the product of causes of both orders, it needs no special proof
that these phenomena also ought to be subject to the measuring method of statistics, —
Therefore, we should not deny the legitimacy of the attempt to calculate the proba-
bilities of birth, though it cannot be denied that the results to be expected stand
further off from a natural law than the inquiries of biometry.

Another difference is presented by the fact that death is caused by the physical —
conditions of a single person only, fecundity by those of two. The probability of
having a child at a given age varies much according to whether the other partner is
young, middle-aged, or old. As we have continually to reckon with this circumstance,
we may be allowed to introduce two denominations for the two species of natal
probabilities, naming those which regard only one sex as monogenous, and those which
take into consideration the age-combinations of both parents as bigenous. It is clear
that only the latter ones deserve the name of a true Table of Natality. Further,
let us name those tables which proceed by single years specified, and those where the
ages are put together by greater (quinquennial, decennial, ete.) groups cumulative.
By a complete bigenous table of natality we mean now such a one, which shows the
probability for each single year of age of father and mother, and that not only sepa-
rately, but by combining each year of age of one parent with each year of the other.
