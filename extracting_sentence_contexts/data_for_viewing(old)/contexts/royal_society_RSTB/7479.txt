other experiments the central part of P, was removed as well as that of P,. In these also the angle
I,-I, increased, and in one of them the genetic spiral reversed permanently, but the displacement
of J, towards P, was usually less.

It is concluded that the position of the centre of each new leaf depends on a balance between
inhibiting influences exerted on the stem apex by existing leaf centres. The position of a new leaf n
depends mainly on the inhibitions coming from the centres of the two youngest leaves, n—1 and n-2,
and to a lesser degree on those from the centres of n—3 and possibly n—4. The strength of the inhibi-
tion thus decreases with the age of the leaf from which it comes and also with the distance from the
inhibiting centre.

The asymmetries of the leaves that arose after the operations are reported and discussed in
comparison with those of the normal leaves. Many of the facts can be explained if it is supposed that
the same influences from existing leaves which tend to inhibit the formation of leaf centres

promote the extension of leaf flanks round the apex. But the asymmetry of J, in most of the
experiments is at present not explained on this hypothesis.

The localization and determination of leaves in Rhoeo is further discussed and compared with
the corresponding processes in Lupinus albus and other dicotyledons. It is concluded that in spiro-
