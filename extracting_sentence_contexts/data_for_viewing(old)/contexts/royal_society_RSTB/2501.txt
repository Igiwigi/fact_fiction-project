VI. Srrenra. VII. Ceracera.

Ophthalmoscopic examination was restricted to the eyes of a Porpoise about an
hour after death. The general background was then of a bluish-slate colour. The
dise is comparatively small; the arteries and veins, each seven in number, radiate
from it at regular intervals, the arteries dividing dichotomously, but not the veins.
The skin encroaches over the eyeball so as to cover it all but the cornea, giving the
appearance of a buttonhole punched out of the skin and the globe being pushed
against it from behind. There are consequently no eyelids, and eyelashes are absent,
and there is no trace of a nictitating membrane. The cornea is flattened in a
horizontal plane, as in the Seal, and indicates a similar high degree of astigmatism.
No doubt the Cetaceans have a similar contrivance to the Seal, enabling them to see
both in air and water ; in fact I found, as in the Seal, an extremely thick lens having
an anterior spherical and a posterior parabolic surface, with a very highly developed
ciliary muscle.

With the exception of the red and white Flying Squirrel (PÃ©eromys magnificus),
the fundus of which bears some resemblance to that of the Skunk, and the Spotted
Cavy (Celogenys paca), which latter has a fundus not unlike that of the Tapir, the
Rodents show no sign of a Tapetum lucidum. They all have fundi which are uniform
in colour, showing various degrees of transparency. The vascularisation differs
