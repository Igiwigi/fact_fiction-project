We shall chooge it 80 as to make the circulation zero. It
would be impossible to determine X,, Y, in the general cage where both & and dþ/ox
are infinite series; but in the case required in the present paper A,/A,_; is of the
order k, k being small, and the terms in A, are neglected after A, This simplifies the
calculation, and it is easy to determine the terms X,, Y, in terms of M,, N,. But it is
further greatly simplified by the fact that in the case to which we have to apply it the
velocity along the surface is already uniform to the firs order—in other words

E(X, cos nv+Y,, 8in 1w)

But since in our applications & is itself 80 8mall that 1* has been neglected compared
with unity, the above becomes
£=—20(1+831?+ 4k cos v+ 61? cos 2v)UE
+/(2k)(1+4/+k cog v+$1? cos 2v)E(X, cos nv+Y,, 8in nw)
The various normal functions will therefore be composed of a set of principal terms

in cos nv, &c., each corrected by an infinite convergent series of small terms of the
others. The principal will be given by

£=—202US,(M, cos nv+N, 8in nv) + 1/(2k)E(X, cos nv+Y,, 8in nv)
