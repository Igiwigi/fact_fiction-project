Read May 4th, 1820. Tux last communication respecting the bones of the Proteo
saurus which I laid before the Royal Society, contained 80
many important facts connected with the skeleton, that there
was no room left to hope, I should ever again call the atten-
tion of its members to this subject. Yet such has been the exertion made by some persons
employed by Colonel Bikcu, to explore the cliffs at Lyme, in
search of fossil organic remains, from an expectation that
they will receive the full reward of their labours, that many
new specimens have been lately collected; in one of these
which Colonel Bixcn has submitted to my observation, several
bones are met with that have not been described, and which
give a very important character to the yertebre, and also form
a more complete set of the bones of the fin. Of these I shall
give a description, where their appearance is not sufficiently
illustrated by the arinexed Plate, (Pl, XV.)
