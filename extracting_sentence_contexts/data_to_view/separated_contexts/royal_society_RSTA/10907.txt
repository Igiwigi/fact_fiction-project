first and second figures of the present series). The point of departure at which the
liquid left the sphere is well marked, and a tangent from this point passes through
the outermost conspicuous droplets that must have been projected from it. In fig. 2 the sphere was dusted at the top and on the right-hand side, but not much
more than halfway down, and the configuration corresponds entirely to the facts. Here again a tangent from the well marked drops on the right-hand side leads very
nearly to the place of departure from the surface of the sphere. In fig. 3 on this page the record is that the sphere was dusty at the top only.
