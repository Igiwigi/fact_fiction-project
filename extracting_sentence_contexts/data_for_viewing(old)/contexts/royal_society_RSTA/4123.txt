as well as experience have shown that voids significantly affect the mechanical properties of
composite laminates. In particular, the compressive strength of a laminate is reduced even at
small void contents. As the mere reduction of the void content beyond a certain level is associated
with exponentially increasing costs, the focus today is to get a better understanding about void
formation and void impact on failure initiation and propagation, especially.

The compressive strength is in fact a limiting design factor because of its poor performance
in comparison with the very high tensile strength. Only ~60% of the tensile strength could be
reached [1]. A further reduction to 50% could be the result of defects like voids [2-4]. In previous
works, most efforts were devoted to describing the influence of voids on fibre-reinforced polymer
(FRP) properties as a function of void volume content. Particularly with regard to the compressive
strength, the void content can have a significant influence as summarized by Schultheisz & Waas
[5]. Bazhenov et al. [2] investigated both the link between compressive strength and void content

as well as the influence of fibre diameter. They concluded that, for thicker fibre diameters, the : =
compressive strength can not only be explained by microbuckling analysis. For modelling the : a
influence, Lee & Soutis [6] suggested to use the fibre microbuckling model by Budiansky [7] to 73
indirectly predict the compressive strength in the presence of voids. Such an approach was first aes
implemented by Gehrig [4] in which the reason for premature failure was disregarded. 22
