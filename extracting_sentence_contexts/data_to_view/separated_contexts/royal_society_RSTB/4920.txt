When the vertical extent is compared, the prevalence of local series in the young plant
will be recalled, and the further fact may be instanced that, though the wounding of
the young nursery plant (fig. 4) was very severe, none of the response to wounds was
carried into the innermost year to any great extent except in the case of the nodal
regions between Nos. 7-8, in and below which there were several severe wounds. Even
here, after the canals were established at the base of the year (No. 8), their number
rapidly decreased, as may be seen in Nos. 10 and 11. (Note the short distance on the
stem between these numbers.)

From the comparison of the responses of young and older forms, it is evident either
that the plant developes responsiveness to wounding, or that there is an accumulation
of the wound stimulus in the older parts. However the cause of greater accumulation
of resin canals in the older parts of the plant may ultimately be explained, the fact
has a distinct bearing on the phylogenetic interpretation that is sometimes put on the
occurrence of resin canals in cone axes, vigorous branches, etc., of mature trees. In
the case of Picea at least these are the result of wounding, and we strongly suspect
that when the contentious forms themselves are studied more carefully in the light of
the present investigations a similar interpretation will be found to hold. Their sporadic

occurrence would then be associated with the contingency of wounding, and not with
their character as vestigial structures.
