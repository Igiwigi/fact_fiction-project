by rotating the insulating cylinder in a longitudinal electric field. RontoEn (* Ann.
der Physik,’ vol. 35, p. 264, 1888) has detected the existence of this force, but the
effect was too small to be measured.

This second system is, I think, intrinsically involved in Lorentz’ and LArRMoR’s
equations, although not explicitly put in this symmetrical form, as far as I can find.

If this system could be established we could proceed to a higher degree of
approximation in the problem of motion of an insulator, and the similarity of the
equations to those for the «ther shows that no greater analytical difficulty would arise.

We must still, however, remember the probable fact that K itself will be modified
by higher order even powers of the velocity.

Thus until the accuracy of these equations or modifications of them is established
beyond reasonable possibility of doubt, it would be a little absurd to apply them to
the motion of an insulator for velocities comparable with that of radiation, and this
consideration prevents me from attempting the solution of a problem which is clearly
soluble from an analytical point of view by a method similar to that used for a perfect
conductor.

Although we cannot therefore proceed to the general problem of a moving insulator
at high speeds, we may show that if the dielectric ratio K is very large, the electric
inertia will be very nearly the same as for a perfect conductor. Since there is
