as the parasphenoid-vomer homology (figure 9c, D).

The important criterion used by embryologists is the relation of certain bones to
the paraseptal cartilages and it is worth while calling attention to the consequences
of accepting this evidence at its face value. The very different relations of the prevomer
and palatine process of the premaxilla, and of the parasphenoid rostrum and the
vomer, have already been mentioned (pp. 306, 317). Further, it should be pointed
out that while the processus cultriformis of the reptilian parasphenoid is applied to the
hinder part of the interorbital septum, the mammalian vomer clasps the lower margin
of the nasal septum. If the relations of the prevomers and vomer to the floor of the
nasal capsule are considered instead of the relations to the paraseptal cartilages alone,
great morphological resemblances are found between them. The prevomers of the
lizard, and in fact of all the non-mammals which have been considered, arise beneath
the floor of the nasal capsule and extend only slightly, if at all, behind the lamina
orbitonasalis. In the fully formed skull they lie between the internal nares and touch
anteriorly the premaxillae, posteriorly the palatines and also, except in a few forms
such as Lacerta, the pterygoids; and they may clasp the anterior tip of the processus
cultriformis in Crossopterygians and Amphibia.

The mammalian vomer arises beneath the septum nasi; it may extend slightly
behind the equivalent of the lamina orbitonasalis, and separates the anterior parts
of the internal nasal passages. Anteriorly it touches the premaxillae, posteriorly the
palatines and, in some forms, the pterygoids. In certain mammals it may even touch
the anterior part of the basisphenoid.
