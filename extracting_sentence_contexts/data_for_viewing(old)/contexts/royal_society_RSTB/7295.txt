rays and blue rays cannot be sharply focused at the same time, except when using very
small pupils (Tscherning 1904). An opaque screen placed before the eye, so that only
marginal rays in one meridian reach the retina, causes white light to be spread into a
spectrum. This would not be the case if the eye were achromatic. Lastly there is the
evidence of chromatic stereoscopy (Tscherning 1904), namely, the fact that to most subjects
red objects in the field of vision appear to advance in front of blue ones (see Part VII, p. 586)
In consequence of these and other experiments, the statement that the eye is largely,
if not entirely, uncorrected for colour error is well founded.

(3) Previous hypotheses

Many hypotheses have been proposed to account for the absence of the effects of
chromatic aberration. (a) That the eye is in fact corrected for colour. () That the mean
refractive index of the eye media resembles that of water, which has a low value. (c) The
rays reaching the eye consist of narrow pencils, which suffer only a small refraction.
(d) There is much scattered light in the retinal image, and this masks the chromatic
aberration. Each of these hypotheses will be briefly considered.

(a) The eye is corrected for colour. This hypothesis, advanced by Euler, caused Dollond to
invent the crown-flint achromatic doublet, an example of a false hypothesis leading to a
valuable discovery. An examination of a section of the human eye shows that the cornea,
the aqueous and the crystalline lens are all equivalent to convex lenses. The vitreous, which
is equivalent to a concave lens, has the same refractive indices as water, and would in
