(a) The production of alcohol by certain members of the A. flavus-oryz@ group is, of
course, well known, since strains of A. oryz@ have long been used in Japan in the
manufacture of alcoholic liquors. It is interesting, however, to find that this character-
istic persists throughout both groups although, of course, it is less marked in some species
than in others. The A. ochraceus and the A. flavus-oryze@ groups are closely allied
biochemically to the A. niger group, but are sharply marked off from the last group
by the fact that, whereas they produce relatively small amounts of titratable acid, the
A. niger group gives rise to considerable quantities. (6) The production of kojic acid by members of this group has been examined in detail
and is reported in Part VII. It may be mentioned, however, that, of the species of this
group in our possession, A. parasiticus Spearn, Ac. 14, gives the best yields of kojic
acid (16-20 per cent.).
