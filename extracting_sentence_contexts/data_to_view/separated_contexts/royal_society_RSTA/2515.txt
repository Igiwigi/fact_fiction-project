Soon we will connect our heating, our oven and our fridge to the Internet, to be accessed from a
distance via software on our phone that we do not trust. What could possibly go wrong? Maybe the most embarrassing fact about computer science is that software companies do not
have to take legal liability for the software they ship. This is very different from car manufacturers
who have to take legal liability for the cars they make, or building companies who have to take
legal liability for the buildings and bridges they build. Is it really so much harder to make correctly
functioning software than to make correctly functioning cars?
