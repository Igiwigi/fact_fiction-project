the body; I have very little doubt that, although captivity may
increase their ferocity, they are not, even in a natural state,
free from each other's attacks. If they are carnivorous, they
probably feed on worms, and various larve, which are
abundant in the peat-bogs above-mentioned, for I have re-
peatedly found the horny and indigestible parts of insects
within their stomachs. Similar relics I have found in the
stomach of the pneumora and gryllus viridissimus. The

two following facts attest- in the tribe of - insects to which
the mole-cricket belongs a remarkable degree of voracity,
and an equally remarkable power of abstaining from food.
My friend Dr. MacarTxEy, of Dublin, informs me that he
has known a gryllus devour a portion of its own body : on
the other hand, my friend Mr. BucxLan, of this University,
gave me, at the commencement of the present summer, a
living gryllotalpa, which had been confined during nine. or
ten months in a tin case, containing a small quantity of garden
mould, without the possibility of having met with any other
nourishment than such as that portion of mould might be
supposed to contain.
