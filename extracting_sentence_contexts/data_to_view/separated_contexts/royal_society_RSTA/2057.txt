Let us note that the central role given to the fluxes in extended thermodynamics, in contrast
to local-equilibrium versions of non-equilibrium thermodynamics (in which the fluxes are
determined by the gradients of the thermodynamic conjugates of the classical equilibrium
variables) fits especially well to the spirit of our globalization epoch. Indeed, the fluxes are
nowadays central concepts of our society: fluxes of capital, of matter (fuel, goods), of information
and of people (migrations, tourism). In fact, they have become some of the critical parameters
for the stability of our model of civilization. Thus, the application of ideas from physics to social
sciences [36] is expected to find in extended thermodynamics a possible source of inspiration for
the treatment of those fluxes. We will conceptually examine, with a minimum number of equations, three main aspects:
(1) transport equations, corresponding to the evolution equations for the fluxes and providing
non-local and nonlinear transport equations with relaxation effects, applicable for instance to
nanosystems, to fast processes or to slowly relaxing systems; (2) non-equilibrium equations of
state for temperature, pressure and chemical potential, obtained as derivatives of a generalized
entropy, incorporating a non-equilibrium contribution due to the presence of the corresponding
fluxes; and (3) fluctuations around non-equilibrium steady states, with their second moments
obtained from a generalized free-energy, leading to flux-fluctuation expressions yielding an
asymmetric probability to fluctuate in the same direction or in the opposite direction to the
steady-state flux.
