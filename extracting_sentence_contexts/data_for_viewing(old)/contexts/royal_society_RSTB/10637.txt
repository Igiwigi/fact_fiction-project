evidence against such activity constituting part of the NCCy
[261-263] (for reviews, see [10,30]). Motivated at least in part
by the potential confound of overt perceptual reports
[16,29,30], the picture that emerges from these studies is that
traditional NCC markers from global-workspace theory (fron-
toparietal activity or the P3b, as measured via non-invasive
neuroimaging) may instead reflect ‘consequences’ of conscious
perception associated with task relevance and post-perceptual
processing. However, it should be noted that the core
predictions of global-workspace theory (i.e. that ‘ignition’ of
activity in global-workspace neurons in frontoparietal cortex
is necessary for conscious perception), while damaged,
remain NCC candidates despite the fact that certain markers
may have been wrong. There is little doubt that auditory infor-
mation has (perhaps automatic) access to frontal and parietal
cortex [264,265], but whether this aspect of brain architecture
supports basic phenomenal awareness as opposed to processes
necessary for the perception—action cycle remains difficult
to tackle [27,39]. In addition, there may still exist latent NCC-
related frontoparietal activity that is difficult to measure
without the use of more advanced methods [266,267] (see
also [268]) or appropriate animal models [269].

Additionally, animal models (in addition to human intra-
cranial recordings and high-field fMRI [270]) might help
