158 BEN DAWES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF

poraneously with the development of the cervical flexure, and when this attains its
maximum the fusion is complete. This takes place while the vertebral components are
still membranous, so that the fusion is relatively earlier in Mus than in the ox, where the
“occipital vertebra” is separate and distinct from the “scheinbar ungegliederte
Abschnitt ” until chondrification takes place.

Throughout the whole occipital region, the perichordal tissue is loose. This obtains
in all probability because of the fact that the notochord is widely removed from the
hind-brain, especially in the posterior part of the region, as a result of the action of the
cervical flexure. When chondrification ensues, the whole of axial tissue becomes
converted into a rod of cartilage. The notochord lies in a longitudinal groove on the
dorsal aspect of the rod. The dorsal tissue of the fused segments chondrifies slightly
later to form what has been referred to as the dorso-lateral mass. At this stage, the
ventral nerves of the three most posterior segments still pass separately through the
membranous tissue connecting the dorso-lateral mass with the centrum portion of the
occipital rudiment, but later a foramen is developed. These nerves form the rudiment
of the hypoglossal nerve.
