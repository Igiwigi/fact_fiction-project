Configuration changes in molecular
and cellular systems are obscured by thermal and other sources of noise. The classical, linear


signal processing solution to this problem is simoothing or filtering: by obtaining (weighted)
averages over a temporal window around each sample in the signal, a statistical estimate of the
configuration at each point in time can be obtained. However, severe limitations to this strategy
arise when the signal can change abruptly, rather than smoothly: in fact, this is not a problem for
which classical linear DSP is suited. To illustrate why classical linear filtering is problematic in this situation, consider the
archetypal, step-like signal: the square wave—periodic with instantaneous transitions between two
different amplitudes—which is obscured by serially uncorrelated (white) noise. A fundamental
fact about linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems is the existence of a unique spectral description,
so it is instructive to describe the situation in the Fourier domain.
