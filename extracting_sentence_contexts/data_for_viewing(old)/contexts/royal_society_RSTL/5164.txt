its being ſaid that the ark reſted on the mountains of
Ararat: ſince, whether the continent was changed or
no, there is no place now remaining that anſwers the
deſcription of the former ; nor is there any thing faid
about the latter, that ſhould lead us to conclude there
ever was ſuch a mountain as Ararat before the flood.

But, - leaving theſe objeQtions from the words of
Scripture, and the hiſtory of the deluge; another
may perhaps ariſe, from this circumſtance, that ſhells
are found in various parts of the earth, which are
evidently not the ſhells peculiar to the ſeas adjoining,
but ſuch as belong to a different climate. This fact
at firſt certainly ſeems to contradict what I have
advanced: and yet, when well conſidered, it , will
perhaps rather be found to confirm my. hypotheſis.
For let any one but look on a terreſtrial globe, and
he will inſtantly ſee, that the, preſent continents are
evidently not in the ſame climates as the preſent ſeas ;
and therefore, though the ſhells found in many places
of the earth are not found in the neighbouring parts
of the ocean ; yet, when thoſe parts of the carth were,
ocean, they might have had a very proper climate and
ſituation there. Thus, for inſtance, we may obſerve
that the Mediterranean is in a more ſouthern climate
