Basso et al. [2] studied 26 right brain-damaged participants
with an extensive battery number and calculation deficits,
excluding patients affected by unilateral neglect. Only three
out of 26 patients in this group were classified as acalculic,
and their performance was not described in detail.

To summarize thus far: although acalculia following a
right hemisphere lesion was consistently found in clinical
group studies, it was very seldom reported in detail. The var-
ious proportions reported possibly reflected the sensitivity of
different calculation tests employed across studies, and the
fact that some works excluded patients affected by neglect
(see a more detailed review of this issue in the next section).
Moreover some studies considered only retro-Rolandic
patients, which further complicated the exact quantification
of the phenomenon.

A recent study of Benavides-Varela et al. [21] further
examined this issue by testing 30 right hemisphere patients
on a comprehensive battery of numerical abilities (numerical
activities of daily living, NADL, [22]), and a variety of neu-
ropsychological tests. Patients performed below the cut-offs
in number comprehension, transcoding and written oper-
ations (particularly in subtraction and multiplication).
