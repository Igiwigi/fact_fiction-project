These appearances will be found represented in
the nervous tissue (Plates VI., VIII., IX.), in muscle (Plates VI., VII., VIIL., IX.), in
minute blood-vessels (fig. 16), and in the crystalline lens (fig. 131). If indeed the
view above mentioned—that the larger and the smaller filaments have the same
structure—be correct, it follows that spirals are much more general in plants them-
selves than has been hitherto snapposed. Spirals would thus appear, in fact, to be
as universal as a © fibrous” structure.

18. The tendency to the spiral form manifests itself yery early. Of this the most
important instance is afforded by the corpuscle of the blood, as above described.
