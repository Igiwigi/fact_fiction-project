However, in all of these cases, the individual behaviour of the ultimate
constitutive objects from which the behaviour of these systems emerges is represented by the
model of classical mechanics and, as such, is at least locally or infinitesimally visualizable, even
though this visualization may be approximate. In classical mechanics, this visualization is essentially connected to the possibility of ideally
representing the motion of classical objects by means of differential calculus, which reflects
this geometrical visualization of the continuous or, more accurately, differential motion, along
a straight or curved trajectory, of an object. In fact, this motion, again, at the level of this
idealized model, can be considered as infinitesimally linear, which circumstance led Newton to
the invention of calculus, although he was compelled to recast his argument, initially developed
via calculus, in terms of Euclidean geometry in Principia [20]. One can, literally, draw a picture
of such motion (as a small curve with a tangent vector as a given point on it) on a blackboard,
actual or that in our mind, which makes these models more descriptive. From this perspective,
visualization is in effect equivalent to the applicability of the concept of classical motion as
infinitesimally represented by differential functions of time and coordinates.
