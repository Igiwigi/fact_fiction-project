Such induced currents would, according to known laws,
have a direction opposed to those of the inducing magnet, and hence would pro-
duce the phenomena of repulsion. To carry out the assumption here made,
M. Ws is obliged to suppose that the molecules of diamagnetic bodies are sur-
rounded by channels, in which the induced molecular currents, once excited, continue
to flow without resistance. This theory, notwithstanding its great beauty, is 80 extremely artificial, that I ima-
gine the general conviction of its truth cannot be very strong ; but there is one con-
clusion flowing from it which appears to me to be in direct opposition to experi-
mental facts. 'The conclusion is, © that the magnetism. of two iron particles in the line
of magnetization is increased by their reciprocal action; but that, on the contrary, the
diamagnetism of two bismuth particles lying in this direction is diminished by their
reciprocal action.”
