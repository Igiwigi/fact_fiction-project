'=] Owing to the $hortness of the periods from which, in many cages, the mean temperatures of Tables IT. and III.
= haye been obtained, the diversity of tho methods of reduction, and, above all, my uncertainty how far the
Â© instruments employed in the Central Provinces, the North-western Provinces, and the Punjab can be accepted
i as accurate and comparable, I hesitate to base any conclusions on small differences of temperature, even when
0, the registers of several stations yield concordant evidence of their reality. For these reasons T am far from con-
{ fident that the peculiar loop which the isotherm of 60 makes in tho Gangetic plain in the January chart ill
ls bo Substantiated by more complete and trustworthy data. Tts existence rests on the evidence of Benares and
Tacknow given in the Tables, with that of Bareilly, Goruckpore, and Fyzabad (each for four years). The
ia January temperatures of theso latter stations are respectively 5794, 60%1, and 60*5, which, reduced to 8ea-
level yalues, are 59*, 60*8, and 61%5, There are, however, independent grounds for regarding as probabl

? - the distribution of temperature thus indicated. There is an ovident relation between the loop of abnormally
i loy temperaturo and that of high pressure 8hown in the 8amo chart ; and the fact already noticed, that southerly

winds prevail on the southern slopes of the Himalaya throughout the cold-weather months, might lead us to
