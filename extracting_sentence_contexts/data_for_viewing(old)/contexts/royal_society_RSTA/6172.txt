Following on from §2, we highlight that this property aligns well with the epistemic
interpretation of probabilities spearheaded by Jaynes [12]. If one embraces the idea that
probabilistic descriptions are representations of states of knowledge, then it follows that the
coordinates used to describe the system determine how the joint distribution ought to be
marginalized—which is also part of our state of knowledge. Then, it is to be expected that
changing the system’s coordinates should change any conclusions drawn from the relationship
between marginals—including causal emergence.

(c) On the order and scale of emergence

Although most of the empirical results from ®ID presented in the literature so far (reviewed in
the next section) correspond to emergence of order k=1, it is important to highlight that the
formalism allows us to tune the value of k to detect emergence at various spatial scales. In fact,
being kth-order emergent implies that there is predictive ability related to interactions of order
k+1 or more. In this regard, it is to be noted that a kth-order emergent feature is emergent
for all orders j < k, and hence increasing the order makes finding emergent features increasingly
challenging. As no system of n parts can display causal emergence of nth order,> an interesting
question is to identify the maximum k at which emergence takes place—which establishes a
characteristic scale for that particular phenomenon.

A related potential misunderstanding is to believe that the ®ID framework for causal
emergence only concerns predictive ability at the microscale, without establishing a proper
comparison with a macroscale [8]. It is important to clarify that this approach to emergence is
established in terms of supervenient macroscopic variables, which may be considered emergent
depending on their dynamics and predictive power over the evolution of the system—not too
