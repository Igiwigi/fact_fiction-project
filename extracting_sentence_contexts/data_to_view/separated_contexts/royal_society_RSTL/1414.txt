affinity for oxymuriatic acid, I
attempted, to procure soda by passing steam over a mixture
of iron filings, and muriate of soda intensely heated : and in
this way, I gucceeded in decomposing some of the salt: hy-
drogene came over ; a little hydrate of soda was formed ; and
muriate of iron was produced. It does not seem improbable, supposing the views that have
been developed accurate, that by complex affinities, even potas-
Sium and sodium in their metallic form, may be procured from
their ox ymuriatic combinations : for this purpose the oxymu-
riatic acid should be attracted by one substance, and the
alkaline metals by another ; and such bodies should be selected
for the experiment, as would produce compounds differing
considerably in degree of volatility. I cannot conclude the subject of the application of these
doctrines, without asking permission to direct the attention of
the Society, to some of the theoretical relations of the facts
noticed in the preceding pages. That a body principally composed of oxymuriatic acid and
ammonia, two substances which have been generally conceived
incapable of existing together, should be so difficult of de-
composition, as to be scarcely affected by any of the agents

of chemistry, is a phanomenon of a perfectly new. kind.
