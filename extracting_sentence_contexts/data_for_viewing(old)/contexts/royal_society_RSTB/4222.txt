of twins of seven months the boys had a longer fissure of Sylvius and a less
exposed insula,

WaAtpeyver concludes “ that the brains of males have—at the same age—a little
more advanced sub-division of the sulci and convolutions ;” but he adds that in some
cases this was not confirmed, and therefore we are not yet able to speak of a “con-
stant relation” (Gesetzmiissig Verhalten) as RupINGER does.

It is a fact that Waupryer, looking for sexual differences, did not call enough
attention to the great importance of the similarity existing in the brains examined,
although he signalises the problem of hereditary resemblances. The work of
WALDEYER gives only negative results in the research of sexual differences; but it
seems to be very important to note that his work also suggests two facts, the import-
ance of which he does not lay enough stress upon, viz.:—

(1) The great similarity of the brains of twins and triplets.

(2) The greater complexity in the pattern of the heaviest brains.

WALDEYER calls attention to the larger development of some lobes in the larger
brains, particularly in the case of the temporal lobe. There are no figures illus-
trating the papers of WALDEver on this subject ; but the brains examined have been
preserved at Berlin for those who would like to see them. The notes of WALDEYER
are mere general impressions ; they are not systematic. The work of WaLpEyER is
an interesting guide to more extensive work.
