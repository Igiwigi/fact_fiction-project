and if this were so the blood volume would have been markedly increased. Unfortu-
nately we did not have the opportunity of making another observation on Doueas
at Colorado Springs. The remaining observations on Dovanas, Haupanr, and
HENDERSON were made at New Haven, at sea-level, the last determinations there

being made three weeks after leaving the summit of the Peak. The percentage of
haemoglobin showed a further decrease during this period, in fact in the case of
Hawpanr the first determinations made at New Haven on August 28 showed that he
had attained his normal sea-level value, and this was maintained during the whole of
the time we were at New Haven. In Henpursoy’s case the hemoglobin percentage
fell gradually so that it almost reached the value shown at the start of the expedition
on September 4. Dovexas showed a distinct decrease of the hemoglobin percentage
as compared with the value at Colorado Springs after returning from the Peak, but
never quite regained his normal sea-level value whilst in America, Dovanas was the
only one of the three to show a gradual return of the total oxygen capacity towards
his normal value during the same period. In the case of both HALDANE and
HeENpDERSON the total oxygen capacity remained at about the sanie level as it had
been just previously in Colorado Springs, and the blood volume of these two was
therefore considerably above normal. Determinations made on HatpANE and
