occipital region.

Four occipital sclerotomes can still be recognised although the sole remaining criterion
is the persistence of the 3 occipito-spinal nerves. The intersegmental blood vessels
have dwindled to most significant proportions. The most posterior occipital sclerotome
is best developed, consisting of a dense lateral part and a looser ventral part which
occupies the region below the notochord. The ganglion corresponding to this segment
(i.e., Frortep’s ganglion) persists, but is very small (‘Text-fig. 3, F.g). The 3rd and 4th
occipital sclerotomes, which are the ones most crushed in the early stages of develop-
ment of the cervical flexure, consist of looser tissue both laterally and ventrally and
are the most ill-developed of all the occipital sclerotomes. The sclerotomal condensa-
tion corresponding to the Ist and 2nd occipital segments consists of dense tissue
laterally, but equally loose tissue ventrally. In fact, throughout the whole occipital
region, loose tissue occurs perichordally, while laterally it is much denser.
