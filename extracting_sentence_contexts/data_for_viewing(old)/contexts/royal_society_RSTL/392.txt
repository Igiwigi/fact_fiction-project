derived from that of Fig. 9, s0 it will equally appear, that four
stars may revolve in different but similar ellipses round their
common centre, as in Fig. 14. For here the four stars, when
placed at abc d, are exactly in the situation represented in
Fig. 13; but, on account of different projectile forces, they re-
volve, not as before in concentric circles, but in similar elliptical
orbits.

Fig. 15 represents three stars, a b c, in the situation of Fig. 5,
to which a small oscillating star, d, is added. The addition of
Such a star to Fig. 1, has been sufficiently explained in Fig. 7;
and, what has been remarked there, may easily be applied to
our present figure. As the fictitious body m, in Fig. 7, was made
to represent the stars a and b, it will now stand for the three
stars a b and c. If we suppose these stars to be of an equal
magnitude in both figures, the centre of gravity o, of the three
stars, will not be 80 far from mz and Â» as in Fig. 7; and the
perturbations will be proportionally lessened,

Fig. 16 gives the situation of three stars, a b c, moving in
equal elliptical orbits about their common focus o, while the
star 4 performs oscillations between 4 and e. What has been
said in explaining Vig. 8, will be sufficient to shew, that the
