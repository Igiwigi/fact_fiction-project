subsister et tre entretenus dans un animal d6capits. Quelque oppos6s que
. ces faits paraissent &tre, il faut 8 souvenir que deux faits bien constat6s ne
peuvyent jamais 8'exclure Vun Vautre, et que la contradiction qu'on croit y re-
marquer tient & ce qu'il y a entre eux quelque interm6diaire, quelque point de
contact qui nous Echappe #,‚Äù The facts which have been detailed in this paper
enable us readily to remove this difficulty, and to account for the paralysis in-
duced by disease of the cerebrum, on one hand, and for the movements of an
anencephalous fetus in utero, or of a decapitated animal, on the other. The
paralysis consists in the loss of yoluntary motion ; the movements of the anen-
cephalous foetus result from the agency of the reflex function of the medulla
spinalis. Le6aLLos' error was that of mistaking the phenomena of the reflex
function for sensation and voluntary motion ; and his difficulty naturally arose
out of this error. There is no real discrepancy between the two orders of facts
to which LecarLos refers.

The same facts enable us to understand how a perfect action of the sphincters
is compatible with paralysis of the limbs from disease of the cerebrum, and even
of the higher parts of the medulla spinalis; whilst paralysis of the sphincters is
usually conjoined with paralysis of the limbs, arising from disease of the lower
part of the spinal marrow. The first intercepts the principle of voluntary mo-
tion; the second affects the very seat of the reflex function which presides over
the action of the sphincters.
