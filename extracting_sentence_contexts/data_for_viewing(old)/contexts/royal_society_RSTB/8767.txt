We found that long-term changes in annual hemispheric
SST were positively correlated to the first BioPC, over most of
the investigated marine areas (figure 7a). The hemispheric
relationship between SST and BioPC1 suggests common
long-term patterns of change, and possibly a common response
to forcing agents. It confirms the results from the positive cor-
relation between BioPC1 and NHT, seen in figure 4a, and
suggests that temperature is a synchronizing agent for BioPC1.

The spatial patterns of the correlation between the second
BioPC and SST, on the other hand, highlight the importance
of oceanic circulation for the biological state: the correlation
patterns appear in fact to mirror the main circulation systems
in the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans (figure 7b).

In addition, both BioPC1 and BioPC2 are strongly nega-
tively correlated to SLP over the Arctic Sea (figure 8a,b).
These correlations might indicate a specific role of the
Arctic area, which has been shown to influence both North
Pacific and North Atlantic ecosystems [76,77].

The relationship between SST, SLP and BioPC3 is less
obvious (figures 7c and 8c). It should be noted that only
four areas are related to this BioPC, so it is less interesting
for our investigation on multi-area synchronicities.
