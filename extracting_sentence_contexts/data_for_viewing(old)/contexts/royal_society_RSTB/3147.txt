He finds the larval mesoblast to have a slightly different staining reaction from
that of the definite mesoderm, which enables the anastomosis of these two structures
to be followed in considerable detail. It results in a general mesodermic tissue
which, in late stages, is a veritable synthesis of ecto- and ecelomesoblast.

I have shown how at an early stage the pole cells of Polygordius lie on the ventral
ectodermic plate, while at a later date they have moved back to come into relation
with the gut. Their final secondary position, as in fig. 30, might thus be taken for
their primary position if it were not for the information furnished by earlier stages.
In the Trochophore larva, I believe, much the same series of changes takes place, only
in their secondary position these cells come to lie actually in the wall of the gut
at the point of its junction with the ectoderm. They are derived from the lips
of the closing blastopore at a point where, as a matter of fact, it is hard to decide
whether they are ecto- or endodermic. Mryrr has found, in Annelids, that the
mesoderm bands in some forms lie close in relation with the endoderm or gut, while
in others they lie close against the ectodermic wall. Whether this difference of
position of the pole cells in Polygordius and Eupomatus accounts for this arrange-
ment, I cannot say. Certainly, no great morphological importance can be attached
to this position of the pole cell in the gut wall, seeing that it is not a primary
condition, HartscHeK, in 1877, first suggested, in the embryology of Pedicellina,
that the pole cells of the mesoderm bands were phylogenetically to be regarded
in the light of germ cells. As such we might expect they might show some
primitive relationship with the endoderm. In many cases the older school of
embryologists considered they had ample evidence of this in the development of
many Annelids. Subsequent investigation, however, has shown this to be by no means
