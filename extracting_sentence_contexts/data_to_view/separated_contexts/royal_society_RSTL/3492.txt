F+(1>co8) (71 +75) These relations, together with the equation

n=&+(1—cos:)/,

are easily seen to render the expressions at the end of art. 55 identical with those of
PoxTECOULANT; in fact, it is by an equiyalent transformation that the latter are
finally obtained by that author from the correct expressions in p. 328. But it is to
be observed that this proceeding is founded upon a false assumption ; for it is im-
possible to express R as a function of a, e, «, », z,, @, as is obvious from the considera-
tion that R, in its original form, is not a function of (:)—# merely, but also of (s);
whilst (:) is not expressible as a function of the new elements, as is $hown by the equa-
tion d(:)=d:,+(1—cos1)d». It would be out of place to enter further into this sub-
