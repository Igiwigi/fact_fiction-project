found explained accordingly ; and it may be confidently asserted that the conclusions
drawn were not vitiated by any such loss. This specious objection, putting out of
court all negative results, is, however, a very old one; as also is the one resuscitated
by Arwater, that luxuriance must be forced to a certain degree to favour the fixation
of free nitrogen. On this point we may state that the results obtained at Rothamsted
were as distinctly negative when luxuriance was favoured by supplies of combined
nitrogen as when it was not.

Atwater concludes that his results do not settle whether the nitrogen gained was
acquired as free or combined nitrogen, by the foliage, or by the soil. He considers,
however, that, in his experiments, the conditions were not favourable for the action
either of electricity or of micro-organisms; and he favours the assumption that the
plants themselves were the agents. Lastly, he considers the fact of the acquisition of
free nitrogen in some way to be well established; and that thus facts of vegetable
production are explained, which otherwise remain unexplained. To this, and other
points involved, we shall refer again in our concluding remarks.

Lastly, we have to summarise those of the results and conclusions of BoussINGAULT
which bear upon the present aspect of the question of the sources of the nitrogen of
vegetation. In his earlier experiments, as in those at Rothamsted, sterilised materials
had been used as soils; but in 1858 he commenced a series in which more or less of a
rich garden soil was mixed with sand and quartz. In some cases the plants were
grown in free air, and in others in closed vessels with confined air. In several cases
there was more or less gain of nitrogen; but the greatest gain was in an experiment
with a lupin grown in a closed vessel. BousstNcavLr points out that it was the soil
