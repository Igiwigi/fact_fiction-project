The mean lunitidal interval would be the mean of the greatest and least interyals,
if the time of high water were not affected by the moon's declination and parallax ;
but in consequence of these circumstances a correction of the mean is requisite. In June 1835, if there had been no corrections for the moon's parallax and deelina-
tion, the least interval at London would haye been on the 16th, the greatest on the
23rd, each 44” from the mean. But, in fact, the least interval was on the 15th, and
was 4” greater than it would have been without the corrections; and the greatest
interval was on the 22nd, and was 9” greater than it would have been without the
corrections. Hence the mean of the observed intervals was 64” greater than it,
would be if declination and parallax did not affect it. If we use the Liverpool tables
in the same way, we find the least interyal, on the 14th, 1” less than without the cor-
rections ; the greatest interval, on the 21st, 15" greater than without the corrections.
