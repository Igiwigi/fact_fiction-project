The direct cause
of the trouble is the equation B = 47gV/. Now, it will be remembered (§ 16 above)
that this equation flows from the assumptions (1) that / contains H and not B
explicitly, and (2) that 470 = VVH. If, then, it can be proved experimentally that
the consequences of the restrictions developed below (the chief of which is that
thermomagnetic phenomena involve dissipation of energy, and that a part of the
thermoelectric phenomena do the same), are contrary to fact; one or both of these
assumptions must be relinquished. Thus, perhaps, in this unexpected quarter, will be
found a practical test of the truth of Maxwett’s fundamental assumption 47€ = VVH. The consequences of relinquishing either of the above assumptions would probably be
much the same, since it would lead to the physicist being compelled to recognise with
