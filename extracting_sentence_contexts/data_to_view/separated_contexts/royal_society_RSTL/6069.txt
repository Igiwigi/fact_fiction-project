q f—1
is, in fact, true if R, instead of being restricted to denote =, denotes any function

whatever of the form 1+bt+cf+&c., and it is true not only for the term in #, but for
all the powers of t not higher than #. And, moreover, R-" may denote any positive or
negative integral or fractional power of R. In fact, the formula (assuming for a moment
the truth of it) hows that the expansion of any power whatever of a series of the form
in question, can be obtained by means of the expansions of the successive positive
integer powers of the same series: the existence of such a formula (at least for negative
powers) was indicated by EISENSTEIN, Crelle, t. xxxix. p. 181 (1850), and the formula
itself, in a slightly different form, was obtained in a very simple manner by Professor
SYLVESTER in his paper, © Development of an idea of EIsENSTEIN,” Quart.
