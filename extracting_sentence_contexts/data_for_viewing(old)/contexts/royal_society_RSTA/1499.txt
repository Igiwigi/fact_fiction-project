Physically, slip occurs when the shear stress on the fault exceeds the fault strength.
Fault strength is determined by a friction law that compares the shear force on a patch of the
fault to the normal force acting on that patch of the fault [24]. When this condition is met, the
fault slips on this local patch, which changes the forces acting on the other fault patches based on
the elastic wave equation. Thus, to make a physical model of an earthquake, we need to specify
the initial forces on the fault, the strength of the fault and the elastic medium surrounding the
fault. In general, the initial forces on the fault cannot be determined in the earth [25], and we will
use a UQ workflow to try and estimate these quantities. A snapshot of the ground shaking from
one of the simulations is shown in figure 1â€”the bumpy line is the rough fault surface, and the
colour scale shows the propagation of elastic waves away from the fault due to the slip on the
fault.

Complicating matters is the fact that earthquake faults are not smooth planes, but instead
rough bumpy surfaces with a fractal geometry [26]. An important consequence of this is that
the smallest wavelength bumps have the largest effect on the resulting forces [27]. This is what
makes earthquake problems challenging to model: at a given model resolution, the simulation
is omitting details that play an important role. This small scale roughness that is left out of the
model must instead be accounted for when setting the strength of the fault. However, for this
