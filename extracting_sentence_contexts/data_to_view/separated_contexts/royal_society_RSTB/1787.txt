Ifa section were taken along a line « — # through such a sporangium,
after it had grown more convex, it would appear as fig. 66, in which the cells shaded
are believed to correspond to those shaded in fig. 65. ‘It becomes apparent from such
sections as these that a single cell, the central cell, had divided periclinally to form
an inner cell and a superficial one ; the former is the archesporium, and has in fig. 66
already divided into two ; the superficial cell has also divided repeatedly. Tangential
sections (#.¢., vertical sections at right angles to « — a, fig. 65) do not greatly aid our
idea of the developing sporangium, and are unsatisfactory owing to the inward curve
which it assumes as a consequence of the stronger growth on the peripheral side of
the sorus: such a section is shown in fig. 67. Though we may thus select sections so
as to represent a reasonably regular and typical structure of the young sporangium,
it is clear, from fig. 65, that what has been described is only a central type, and as a

matter of fact hardly any two sporangia show exactly the same details of segmentation. A comparison of our central type, as illustrated in fig. 66, shows substantial corre-
spondence with the drawing of Gorset (‘ Bot, Zeit., 1881, Plate 6, fig. 4), while even
the walls which he numbered 1-5 may be compared with the principal walls in our
fig. 66 ; but since we find that these are not constant, this correspondence in detail
cannot be considered of material importance. An older sporangium of typical
structure is shown in fig, 68, and it is an easy matter to see how such a younger
sporangium as fig. 66 might develop into it ; the correspondence again with GoEBEL’s
