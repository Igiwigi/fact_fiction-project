Let also e be the © mechanical energy*” of the fluid, reckoned from 8ome assumed
standard or zero state, that is, the 8um of the mechanical value of the heat commu-
nicated to it, and of the work spent on it, to raise it from that zero state to the
condition defined by (»,t); and let N and K be its specific heats with constant
volume, and with constant pressure, respectively. Then denoting, as before, the
mechanical equivalent of the thermal unit by J, and the value of Carxor's function
for the temperature # by w, we havef

equations which express two oth theorems regarding the specific heats of any
fluid whatever, first publishedF in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
March 1851. The former (4) is the extension of a theorem on the specific heats of
gases originally given by Carxory, while the latter (5) is inconsistent with one of his
fundamental assumptions, and expresses in fact the opposed axiom of the Dynamical
Theory. The use of the absolute thermo-dynamic system of thermometry proposed
