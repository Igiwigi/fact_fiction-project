It is unnecessary for the moment to do more than draw attention to the large
amount of work which has been done on the mammalian placenta, and the great advance
made in our knowledge of this most remarkable organ during the last twenty years. Anyone acquainted with the work of Von Bagrr, Biscnorr, Cosrr, Erconant,
Turner, Rouieston and Owen, will know that the placenta is a subject which has
not been neglected, and he will also know that it is a subject which, from a
morphologist’s point of view, is of great difficulty. Not only have the facts been
disputed and, indeed, still are in dispute, but, granted agreement as to facts, the
interpretations that can be placed thereon frequently differ. The greater part of the work on this subject in recent years has been done upon
mammals having the so-called deciduate type of placenta. Such .work is that of
Srrany upon the Dog and Ferret, FieiscaHmaNnn on the Cat and Dog, Duvau on the
Cat, Dog, Rat, Guinea-pig, VAN BrenepEN and Fromme and Notr on the Bat,
JENKINSON on the Mouse, Husrecur on the Hedge-hog, Shrew, Mole, Tupaia,
