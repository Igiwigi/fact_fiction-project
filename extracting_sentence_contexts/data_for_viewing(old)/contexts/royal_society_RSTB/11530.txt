to change accordingly. Here, we discuss two ring motors that
display asymmetric ATPase activity: the ¢29 DNA packaging
motor and the protease ClpXP.

The ©29 DNA packaging motor is known to translocate
10 bp of DNA per cycle in a burst of four power strokes, each
2.5 bp in size, interspersed by dwell times of about 80 ms on
average at saturating [ATP] [23]. Because the 29 packaging
motor is a homo-pentamer, the four power strokes reveal a cru-
cial symmetry breaking in its operation: only 4 out of the 5
subunits perform DNA translocation. It has been proposed
that the remaining subunit performs a regulatory function in
the ring. In fact, temporary inactivation of the fifth subunit
with ATPYS results in greatly lengthened dwell times [24] fol-
lowed by a 10 base pair burst, suggesting that proper turnover
of ATP by the fifth subunit is necessary to initiate the transloca-
tion cascade by the other four subunits in a timely manner.
Because the motor is known to contact two DNA phosphates
every 10 bp, it was proposed that the observed functional
difference between otherwise identical subunits results from
the periodic contact of the fifth subunit with the motor’s sub-
strate [47]. A recent single-molecule study that combines
targeted mutagenesis and cryo-EM reconstruction, provides
further insights into the mechanism that enables division of
labour among identical subunits [17]. In this study, a substi-
