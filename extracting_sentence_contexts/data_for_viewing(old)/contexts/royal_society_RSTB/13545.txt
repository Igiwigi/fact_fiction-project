reconstructions are (even when adding inferences from ancient
epigenomes; [70]), but, more importantly, it is not obvious what
articulatory, acoustic and linguistic effects different positions
of the larynx would have. The original claims [6] that
Neanderthals had a much higher larynx than modern
humans and that this precluded them from producing the full
spectrum of vowels found in the currently spoken languages,
did not age well. Newer models of speech articulation seem
to suggest that the vowel space produced with a higher
larynx is not terribly limited thanks to active compensation by
the other articulators [2-4], that the rest position of the larynx
is not very relevant given its wide dynamic range [83,84], and
that the Neanderthal hyoid bone was, in fact, anatomically
and biomechanically extremely similar to the modern human
one [85]. Finally, despite the importance of the peripheral
vowels, and the fact that actual speech productions are spread
across the potential (acoustic and articulatory) vowel space rela-
tively independently of the described phonological system of
the language, few modern languages use the full extent of
this potential space to convey phonological distinctions.

As we will detail below, the hard structures of the vocal
tract have by far the highest chances of preservation in the
osteological and fossil record, suggesting that we should
focus on the hard palate, the jaw and the teeth. There is tre-
