(Reproduced from the ‘ Proceedings of the Royal Society, vol. xxxvi., Pl. L.) In the air waves which were produced by the eruption of Krakatoa these features
were by no means so marked, and, in fact, Lieutenant-General Srracury was led to
the conclusion, partly from his studies of the actual barographic tracings, and partly
from the theoretical researches of Lord Rayterau, that ‘the rise of the barometer
indicating a sudden increase of pressure was the first and direct result of the
explosion, and that the succeeding fall of the barometer . . . required some
considerable time for its development.”

The Sea Waves. We have already detailed the observations regarding sea waves occasioned by the
great eruption of St. Vincent on May 7th in Barbados, Bequia, St. Lucia, Martinique,
and Guadeloupe.
