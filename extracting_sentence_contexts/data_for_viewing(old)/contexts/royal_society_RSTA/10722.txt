EQUATIONS OF PROPAGATION OF ELECTRIC WAVES. 33

A, and not to the disturbance B. The relation between A and B is similar to that
between the “complementary function” and a “particular integral” of a linear
differential equation, with a right-hand member; the difference between two particular
integrals is part of the complementary function.*

Perhaps the simplest way of building up the functions u_, . . . is to act upon a
hint, derived from a study of Hetmuontrz’s theory of acoustical resonators.t We
may, in fact, attempt to satisfy the conditions, by regarding the disturbance B as
consisting of a system of standing waves; and we find that the method thus
suggested is successful. We shall proceed on the assumption that the displacements,
represented by w_, . . . , constitute a system of standing waves. |

28. Having regard to the proposed plan of passing to a limit when the point
(x, y, 2) is brought to coincidence with (2’, y’, 2’), we see that especial importance
attaches to the limiting values of such expressions as

cos «(ct — r) — xrsin «(ct — r),

which, in § 26, have uniformly been placed in { }; and it appears that all these
limiting values are numerical multiples of cos x ct. This remark indicates that the
