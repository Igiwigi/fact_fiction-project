the lower pinnules overlapping the bases of the pinnules above. The pinnules vary in
shape from small strap-shaped structures, 2 mm. long (Plate 16, figs. 4 and 6), situated at
the base of the frond, to sub-circular structures as much as 12 mm. in diameter (Plate 16,
fig. 7), set higher up. The pinnule is attached to the stem by a short footstalk, which is set
obliquely to the rachis. he pinnules, except those at the apical end of the frond, are
almost symmetrical, The vascular supply to the pinnule as it leaves the footstalk and
enters the lamina divides nearly equally (Plate 17, fig. 14).

Of all the described species it is most closely allied to R. inequilatera Gorp. and
R. Lindseeformis, Bunpury.* There are, however, differences by which it may be
distinguished from either of these two species. In contrast to both, the pinnules of
R. circularis are more circular in outline, and never show the same degree of asymmetry.
It differs, too, in the fact that the pinnules do not overlap the rachis, nor do they
overlap one another to any great extent. There is not the same pronounced unilateral
branching of the vein-system as is found in R. inequilatera and R. Lindseceformis, most
of the veins radiating from the base of the pinnule; but this tendency is seen in some

No. 3, Plate IV. fig. 1, should possibly be assigned to R. circularis.

of the upper pinnules of the frond (Plate 16, fig. 7), where at the same time the pinnules
lose their symmetrical shape and resemble those of R. inequilatera more closely. The
