The right-hand side indicates that this is due to the
Sbfollowing causes :—

-4 (a) We are considering the fluid contained in a volume element which moves with

ithe mean motion of the fluid; but in addition to this motion there is one of inter-
® diffusion within the element, there being a stream of + (%w’o, vo, »w')) molecules

§ (8) Owing to the motion of diffusion there will be an increase in the number of
molecules m, and an equal decrease in the number of molecules m,, at the rate of
