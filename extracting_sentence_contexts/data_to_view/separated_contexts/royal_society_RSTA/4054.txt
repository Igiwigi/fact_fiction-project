[PLaTEs 2-3.*]

Iy a previous paper (‘ Philosophical Transactions,’ A, 1897, vol. 189, p. 137) we have
drawn attention to the fact that the disturbance set: up in a liquid by the impact of a
rough sphere falling into it, differs in a very remarkable manner from that which
follows the entry of a smooth sphere. In the present paper we describe further
experiments, made with the object of ascertaining the reason of this difference, and
give the conclusions reached. It appeared desirable, in the first place, to take instantaneous photographs of the
disturbed liquid below the water-line.
