experiment it appears, that 21 degrees of solar heat were given
in one minute to a thermometer, by rays which had no power
of illuminating objects, and which could not be rendered visible,
notwithstanding they were brought together in the focus of a
burning lens. The same has also. been‚Äù proved of terrestrial
heat, in the gth experiment ; where, in one minute, 39 degrees

by incontrovertible facts, that there are rays of heat, both solar
and terrestrial, not endowed with a power of rendering objects
visible.

It has also been proved, by the whole tenour of our prismatic
experiments, that this invisible heat is continued, from the be-
ginning of the least refrangible rays towards the most refran-
gible ones, in a series of uninterrupted gradation, from a gentle
beginning to a certain maximum ; and that it afterwards declines,
as uniformly, to a vanishing state. These phenomena have been
ascertained by an instrument, which, figuratively speaking, we
may call blind, and which, therefore, could give us no infor-
mation about light ; yet, by its faithful report, the thermometer,
