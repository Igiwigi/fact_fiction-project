In the
water column, the cultivable genera with the highest in situ abundance were Polaribacter
(Flavobacteriia) with 7%, Pseudoalteromonas (Gammaproteobacteria) with 3%, Paraglaciecola
(Gammaproteobacteria) with 2%, Rhodococcus (Actinobacetria) with 2% and Pseudomonas
(Gammaproteobacteria) with 1% of total sequences. This is a rough estimate, because each genus
may contain many different species, of which only a few representatives have been isolated. However, these results underline the fact that the isolated strains were overall representative of
the in situ bacterial community, especially in the sea ice bottom. Finally, comparison of the sequences of our isolated strains with sequences in the
EZBiocloud database revealed that the lowest percentage of similarity (95.72%) was obtained
for Antarcticibacterium flavum [65] belonging to the class of Flavobacteriia (Bacteroidetes). This
low percentage of similarity suggests the isolation of a new species belonging to the genus
Antarcticibacterium which can only be confirmed by further genetic analysis.
