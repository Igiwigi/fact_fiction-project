colour, the effect of contrast
is very striking ; the border of the front flame being opake to thallium, whilst it is trans-
parent to lithium, the flame appears of a beautiful green colour with a crimson edge. 16. The atomic weight of thallium has been a subject to which my attention has been
directed for s0me months, in fact ever since IT commenced to obtain the metal in suffi-
cient quantities to enable me to purify it to the requisite degree without too much
diminishing my stock. The investigation is far from concluded as yet, and the numbers
which I have obtained must be regarded as only approximate. M. Lawy* gives the
equivalent as 204, As, however, he gives no statement respecting the processes adopted
to arrive at this figure, and we are not even informed of the number of experiments of
which this is the mean result, of the quantities of material operated upon, or the
divergence of each result from the mean 204, it is impossible to know what value is to
be attached to it.
