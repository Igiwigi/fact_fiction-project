MrppLeron (1931) considers it uncertain whether females have
more than one litter. The average size of litter is not known directly as no nests
with young were obtained. The fact that the shrew has six nipples indicates that
the litter size will not be much in excess of this number. It can be estimated with
reasonable accuracy from the number of maturing follicles, of corpora lutea, and of
embryos in utero in post-implantation stages of pregnancy. A group of maturing follicles, clearly defined from the small follicles, can be
identified in the ovaries of about one-third of the adult animals available for this
purpose.
