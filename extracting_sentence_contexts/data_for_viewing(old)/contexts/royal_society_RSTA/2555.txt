by up to 2 nominal pipe diameters downstream of each flooded node). When considering a
high emissions scenario, this strategy reduces the number of flooded nodes compared to the
do-nothing strategy but is only fully effective over the short term until 2030 and only for the
upstream sections of the network. Flooding continues to be experienced in drainage area 5 and,
so, such a solution must also work in conjunction with some form of source control. Furthermore,
increasing pipe sizes alone is initially successful, but by the end of the planning period it only
reduces the total flood volume by 21% compared to the ‘do-nothing’ option (tables 3 and 4). When
considering a central emissions scenario, a similar effect is observed with regards to flooding in
drainage area 5. The solution reduces the total flood volume by 27% compared to the ‘do-nothing’
option (table 3), i.e. is marginally more effective than in the high emissions scenario.

Both BCs and PPs are considered to capture (up to) 80% of runoff from impervious areas
and 50% from pervious areas. The difference reflects the fact that there is typically more control
over pre-engineered areas. Interventions are implemented in the drainage areas upstream of the
manholes predicted by the model to flood, with any excess runoff flowing to the immediately
