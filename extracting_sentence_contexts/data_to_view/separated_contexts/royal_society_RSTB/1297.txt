Another form of the struggle exhibits the suppression of the chordal sheath. When
this first began we do not know. The few recent cartilaginous Ganoids and Cyclos-
tomes do not show any reduction of the sheath, but in the osseus Ganoids and
Teleosteans it was the consequence of the fact that the same skleral metamerism had
asserted itself. It is obvious that gradual suppression of a more primitive rival is a
more complete victory than its conversion. Tt is wrong to assume that the so-called membranous stage of the vertebral
column is followed by a likewise non-segmented continuous cartilaginous stage.
