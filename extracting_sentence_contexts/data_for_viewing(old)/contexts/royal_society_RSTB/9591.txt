As outcomes lacking explicit counterfactuals (figure 2),
measures of the state of biodiversity could be misleading
about impact. Improving or maintaining species status
within protected areas could be taken to indicate success of
protection, even if the same trends are occurring in unprotec-
ted areas and impact is, in fact, zero. Similarly, a protected
area suffering declines in numbers of some species could be
viewed as a failure, even if trends in numbers under protec-
tion are dramatically better than more serious negative trends
without protection.

Conservation resources can also be misdirected if counter-
factual biodiversity outcomes are not correctly defined. This
risk is illustrated by a measure of conservation progress
proposed in Australia [64]. The measure compares the
amount of additional protection, say of an ecosystem, with
the amount of loss of that ecosystem over a defined period,
but the measure can be unrelated to impact. The measure
would be strongly positive, for example, if extensive new pro-
tection focused on already-secure examples of ecosystems,
say on public land immune from vegetation loss, and
strongly outweighed loss on other tenures; but this would
obscure a net loss, with the protection part of the ratio not
reflecting impact but simply a change in management
