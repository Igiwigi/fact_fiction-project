Three exposures were made for periods of 20 seconds each. The first began
just after totality had commenced, and gives a good representation of the corona—
the two longest streamers extending only one lunar diameter. The second photo-
graph shows clearly the lower corona, notwithstanding the fact that part of the sun
had begun to appear. During the third exposure the camera was slightly shaken, so —
that the image is duplicated. Two cameras fitted with instantaneous shutters were set up with the view of
photographing the shadow passing over the landscape in case its boundary should be
sufficiently well defined.
