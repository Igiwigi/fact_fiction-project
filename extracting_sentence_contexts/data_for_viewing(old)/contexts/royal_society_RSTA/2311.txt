[13-15], while nothing like this is currently known about non-contextuality. However, this may
very well be due to the simple fact that no measures of non-contextuality have so far been
proposed and studied.

1.7 The three measures of contextuality considered in this paper are CbD-based, which means
that they are not constrained by the assumption of consistent connectedness. We had to leave
out a large number of interesting contextuality measures discussed in the literature under the
consistent connectedness constraint (with the exception of the contextual fraction measure that
we generalize to apply to arbitrary systems). Thus, most of the measures of non-locality (as a
special case of contextuality) reviewed in [16] cannot be naturally extended to measures of locality
(non-contextuality). The measures of contextuality constructed in relation to Bell-type criteria of
non-contextuality for consistently connected systems, as e.g. in [17], usually can be extended to
measures of non-contextuality along the lines of our opening example. The fact that we do not
discuss these measures in detail is a reflection of the focus of this paper rather than our view of
their relative importance.

2. Basics of the Contextuality-by-Default approach

2.1 A system R of random variables is a set whose elements are random variables Rf labelled in
two ways: by their contents q € Q (that which the random variable measures or responds to) and
their contexts c € C (the conditions under which this random variable is recorded):

R=(Rj:ceCqeQq~<c}, (2.1)

where q <c indicates that content q is measured (or responded to) in context c. Throughout this
