We have now to draw
attention to some extremely important considerations concerning the relative repre-
sentation of the movements of flexion and extension. We have just seen that pure
extension was limited to certain centres ; we have now to add that we have only seen
pure flexion at centres 1, 1’, 4, and 4’. We are not inclined to lay much stress on
this limitation of the representation of the movements of pure flexion and extension,
but we note the foregoing facts for the purpose of recording them. We will now consider what appears to us the much more important co-operation of
these two movements of flexion and extension of the digits. On this point we have
obtained the exceedingly definite result that both movements are represented in the
middle 4 of the ascending frontal and parietal convolutions, and that, while in the
ascending frontal convolution extension precedes flexion, in the ascending parietal
convolution this order is reversed, and so extension follows flexion.
