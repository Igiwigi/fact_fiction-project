To describe the ganglion-cells of the Mammalian spinal cord as confined to the grey
substance of the cord is not quite strictly correct. Brrsso* was the first to draw
attention to the fact, that apart from axis-cylinder processes which pass into the
ventral roots from cells of the ventral cornu, there project also from those cells of the
cornu which lie next the white column other branches to mingle with the fibres of the
bundles of the ventral nerve-roots. The ganglion-cells of the grey matter often, by
one or more of their processes, jut partially into the white matter. The descriptions of
Bersso,t Pick,t and Scu1EFFERDECKERS have further shown that in certain situations
in the anterior and lateral columns, ganglion-cells lie outside the grey substance in
the surrounding white matter.
