On the contrary,
a destabilizing effect can be obtained when the product has a sufficiently larger contribution to
density than both reactants. We have experimentally demonstrated this case for dissolution of
gaseous CO} into aqueous solutions of hydroxide bases (figure 6) [53,76]. A striking aspect of
this control is the fact that the amplitude of the chemical stabilization or enhancement varies
with the nature of the reactant in the host phase and with its concentration. As an example,
convective fingers are more intense and appear earlier than in non-reactive systems as soon =
as CO) reacts with the hydroxide base to produce a denser salt. This effect is stronger for the : 3
series LiOH < NaOH < KOH < CsOH [53].
