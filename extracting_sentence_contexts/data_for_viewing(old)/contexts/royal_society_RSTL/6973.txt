Numerous experiments were subsequently made, with a view of testing this result, but
in all cases the bisuIphide was found more opaque than the chloroform to the radiation
of the small gas-flame. The same result was obtained when a very small oil-flame was
employed; and it came ont in a very decided manner when the source of heat was a
flame of bisulphide of carbon. Tt was found moreover that, whenever two liquids under-
went @ change of position of this kind, the vapours of the liquids underwent a similar
change; in its finest gradations, the deportment of the liquid was imitated by that of
its vapour.

And here we find ourselves in a position to offer solutions of various facts which have
hitherto stood as enigmas in researches upon radiant heat. It was for a time generally
$upposed that the power of heat to penetrate diathermic substances augmented as the
temperature of the source of heat became more eleyated. KNoBLAUCH contended against
this notion, showing that the heat emitted by a platinum wire plunged into an alcohol
flame was less absorbed by certain diathermic screens than the heat of the flame itself,
and justly arguing that the temperature of the spiral could not be higher than that of
the body from which it derived its heat. A plate of glass being introduced between his
Source and his thermo-electric pile, the deflection of his needle fell from 35* to 199
when the source was the platinum spiral ; while, when the source was the flame of
alcohol, when the glass was introduced the deflection fell from 35* to 16*, proving
that the radiation from the flame was intercepted more powerfully than that from the
spiralâ€”showing, in other words, that the heat emanating from the body of highest
