When the principal magnet was in the westerly position, the
corresponding difference of readings was 14:61. We are to take the mean of these,
1.e., 14'08, as the difference of readings due to reversal at a distance of 347*5 millims,
The half of this, or 704, corresponds to the siple presentation or removal of the
magnet, The distance from mirror to scale was 2670 millims, 80 that the tangent of

7-04 :
Ix 2670 "This result has to be adjusted to correspond
with the distance 1/(a*+d)), in place of 3475, Hence

the angle of deflection was

4 55 *f 4
tan pre agrg= 00408
In this calculation the error due to the principal magnet having been necessarily
placed ab a different level from that of the suspended magnet is ignored. As a matter
of fact a relatively considerable correction is required. If 6 be the altitude of one
magnet as 8een from the other, the observed effect is too 8mall in the ratio (1â€”3) :1. The above written value of tan p 1equires to be increased about 3 per cent. ; 80 that

we take
tan p=00420,
