characterized by extensive well laid-out gardens and especially by the elegant axes, the
beautiful blades of which with squared sides are unlike any others in New Guinea and
clearly indicate a spread of culture from Indonesia; the route as far as New Guinea is
concerned was probably to the north-west of the zone, where traces of the higher
cultivation have been observed. Tobacco of good quality is planted, but not extensively
in the Mount Hagen district. A few old men smoke, but the natives as a whole are
non-smokers; smoking becomes more general the farther south one goes. The holder
only is used. (B) South of the boundary the cultures appear on the whole to be
backward. The pipes and holders are dealt with on pp. 123-128; it is only in the north-
western area in the Tari valley that the pipes are decorated with well-defined patterns ~
in the burnt technique.

The foregoing facts strongly suggest an irruption of a new culture brought by an
unknown immigration into an area of lower culture which coincides with the southern
zone of the Mandated Territory; this lower culture also extended into the most
northerly portion of Papua. This immigration may have been one of the contributory
causes for the isolation of the rich ceremonial cultures of the coastal areas from those

of the area of the Sépik river. If that be so, the immigration must have taken place at
a comparatively recent date, but it does not explain why the presumably early low
culture had not been affected by the Sépik-south coast culture. All this is pure
hypothesis.
