To the best of our knowledge, the latter cannot
depend on the velocity discretization but it can be space- and/or time-dependent [55]. Usually,
a=1 for DVMs [29], while the work by Frapolli et al. [41] relies on a= pw;(T) where w;(T) are
temperature-dependent quadrature weights. In the present context, we chose to underline (1) the
quadrature-free property of our approach by discarding quadrature-weights, (2) the fact that we
are applying this methodology to the simulation of fluid flows by keeping the density in the
definition of the numerical equilibrium through a = p. The latter choice eventually leads to the
numerical equilibrium (2.13). Whereas the latter choice does not have a direct impact on imposed
moments, it may lead to different stability domains for the root-finding algorithm.
