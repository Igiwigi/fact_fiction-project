(b) Hybrid Monte Carlo

Hybrid Monte Carlo (also referred to as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)) [36] is an MCMC
method which is designed to explore parameter spaces more efficiently that the Metropolis
algorithm. To facilitate an understanding of HMC, one must envisage that the ith element of
the parameter vector 6 represents the displacement of a particle in the ith direction. One then
introduces a vector of momenta p € R* (recalling that Ng is the number of parameters to be
estimated) such that the Hamiltonian of the system is H = K(p)+V(@) (where K and V are
the kinetic and potential energies, respectively). Introducing a fictitious ‘time’ variable r, the
dynamics of the system can then be evolved through t according to

ar p and dr VV. (3.4)
Writing p =| p |, the key here is to define the kinetic and potential energies as

K= > and V=-—In(x*(6)) (3.5)
such that

H= 77 In(z*) and exp(—H) = exp 7 x. (3.6)
