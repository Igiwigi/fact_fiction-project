The puraseptals (fig. 10, proc.p.) are short and extend no further back than some
six or eight sections behind the anterior palatine foramen (fig. 10). The palatine
processes of the premaxillee are larger than in the last model, they reach almost to
the back of the anterior palatine foramen, also they are beginning to enwrap the
paraseptals, thus forming a double-walled capsule for Jacobson’s organs. There
is an increase in size of the processus alaris superior (p70c.a.s.) to be noted and
a strengthening of the processus lateralis anterior (pvoe./.a.).

Meckel’s Curtilage, Auditory Ossicles and Dentary.

The changes in the lower jaw consequent upon development are interesting and
worthy of a detailed description in spite of the fact that they have been previously
described by Parmer (35). At this stage Meckel’s cartilages appear to occupy quite
a secondary place in the formation of the lower jaw; they no longer meet at the
anterior end but have shrunk back and are not seen in the sections until No. 70
(fig. 12). Each is also much slighter, and in section is quite small and almost
circular. Between the anterior ends and separating the dentaries is a median
mass of cartilage (fig. 11) which, from the sections, would appear to have no connec-
tion with Meckel’s cartilage but to be merely the early representation of the ,
symphysial cartilage. As in Stage II, Meckel’s cartilage passes imperceptibly into
the malleus. In comparison with the size of the skull this is much smaller than
in the young stage, and it is more elaborate in form. The articulating surface
for the incus is deeply concave (fig. 17), the manubrium, now ossified, has what
Parker has termed the auxiliary process formed in cartilage. The iecus (z.) also
