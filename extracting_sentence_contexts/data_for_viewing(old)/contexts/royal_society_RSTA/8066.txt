1. Introduction.

In a previous paper* I drew attention to the fact that, owing to the peculiar geo-
graphical position of Bombay, almost all the “heat” thunderstorms} which form
during the pre-monsoon and the post-monsoon periods over the hills to the east of
the Colaba Observatory, between the sea coast and the Western Ghats, develop a
westerly movement and pass over the station. When the air has attained a certain
state in regard to its moisture content and lapse-rate, these thunderstorms are initiated
by the strong instability produced through the heating of the surface layers over the
hills by intense insolation. Their westerly movement was explained by means of the
schematic diagram given in fig. 4 of the paper mentioned above. There is no definite
evidence whether the “ trigger action ” is caused by a kind of katabatic flow down the
Western Ghats advancing as a wedge, but such an assumption would not be inconsistent
with this schematic diagram. A second class of thunderstorms of the usual ~ line-
squall” type form on the discontinuous fronts associated with the temporary or
