By subtracting ‘000782 from the numbers in the second column of the last Table, we
get the increase of the logarithmie decrement due to the reversals in each case, and it
is interesting to compare this increase with the stress producing it ; this comparison
is made below.

The increase of the logarithmic decrement due to the reversals of the magnetic stress
is, for small stresses, proportional to the latter. When the magnetic stress reaches
1°800 the friction increases in greater proportion than the stress, until the latter ex-
ceeds 12°935, when the ratio B: A begins to decline.* This is what might be expected
from the behaviour of the magnetic permeability as the stress is gradually increased :
in fact, with this particular specimen of iron, the permeability was found to increase
very rapidly as the magnetic stress rose from 3 to 5 C.G.S. units, and again fell very
rapidly when the stress rose from 12 upwards. The damping effect of magnetic stress, when applied as above, is noteworthy for its
magnitude ; for the logarithmic decrement when the wire is subjected to reversals of
a magnetic stress of 28°540 is actually between twenty and thirty times as great as
when the wire is free from stress or under the influence of a sustained magnetising
stress.t

Experiment X. In this experiment the effects of reversals and of applying and removing the mag-
netic stress always in the same direction were compared together, the magnetic stress
being in each case 42°775 C.G.S. units, and the vibration-period of the wire 4°725
seconds.
