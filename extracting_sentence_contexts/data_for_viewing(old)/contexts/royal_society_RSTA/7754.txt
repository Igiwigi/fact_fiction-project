F(R), denoting the work required to decrease the interval between the two atoms or
ions from o to R. The question of this potential energy has been the subject of
numerous theoretical investigations, commencing with HerrLer’s and Lonpon’s well-
known papers (HerrLer and Lonpon 1927; LONDON 1928 a, 6) on the reciprocal action
of two atoms of hydrogen. On the other hand, we possess no further empirical know-
ledge concerning this potential energy #. The present paper is an attempt to analyse,
by the aid of accessible experimental data, the question of the dependence of energy
on the interatomic distance for atoms and ions with closed shells.

Attempts have been made to find reasonable expressions for the forces acting
between the ions in crystal lattices, by the aid of values experimentally determined
for density, elastic constants and compressibility of crystals. However, these attempts
have not been very successful, this being due to the fact that the above-mentioned
properties are determined by the first and second derivatives of the potential function

for a single value R= Ry (WASASTJERNA 1935 d), whereas the general course of the
function F(R) remains unknown. A potential energy of the rather arbitrarily chosen
form bR-”, where b and rare two constants, has generally been added to the potential
energy of the electrostatic force. Later investigations by LENNARD-JONES and TAYLOR
(1925) and the present author (WASASTJERNA 1932 d) are definitely in favour of the
