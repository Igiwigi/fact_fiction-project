of Discontinuous Functions,” 'Trans. Royal Irish Academy, vol. xxi. (1848), pp. 124-139,
and © On a certain Multiple Definite Integral,” do. pp. 140-150 (the particular theorem
about to be referred to is stated in the postscript of this memoir), and in the memoir
*On the Comparison of 'Transcendents, with certain applications to the theory of
Definite Integrals,” Phil. Trans. vol. 147, for 1857, pp. 745-803, the theorem being the
third example, p. 794. The method is similar to that of, and was in fact suggested by,
LeJguxe-DiRIcHLev; the auxiliary theorem made use of in the memoir of 1857 for the
representation of the discontinuity being
