By the method given in the preceding pages, the coefficients

methods have been given for that purpose for all values of e, and
consequently for all values of a and b. If the coefficients are to
be determined by deriving A, B, from A', B', &c. the best method
to be followed, is that given by Mr. Ivory, who determines the
coefficients, when the index 2m+1= —1, in fact, by integrating

depends.*

The author last mentioned, in his valuable Paper inserted in the
Edinb. Transactions, first, I believe, applied the method of trans-
forming f, F, into similar integrals f', F', F”, F”, &c. to the
determination of the coefficients A, B, &c.; but the method of trans-
formation belongs to LacRANGE, | This great mathematician has
