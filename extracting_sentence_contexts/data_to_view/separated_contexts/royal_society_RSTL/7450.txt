In the case where the
point P is at a cusp, then the »—2 tangents become the n—3 tangents from the cusp,
and the tangent at the cusp; hence the curve © meets the given curve in 2(4—3)+3,
=24—3 points, that is, (@—2)+(2—1) points; this does not prove (ante, No. 96), but
the fact is, that the cusp counts in the Supplement (2 —1) times, and the expression of
the Supplement is =(n—1)z. It is clear that we have p=PB'=(n—2)(m—3), 80 that
the equation is
8D—2z+2r—2(n—2)(m—3)+(n—1)z=(n—2)2D,

2r=2(n—2)(m—3)+(n—6)2D+(—n+3)z;
or substituting for 2D its value =n— 2m+2+zx and reducing, this is
s 2r=w+8m—10n— 3x,

that is,

which is right.

it be required to find the class of the curve enveloped by the line PQ. ; Take an arbi-
trary point O, join OQ, and let this meet the curve minP'; then (EP; P) are points on
the curve m having a (ms, me') correspondence ; in fact to a ava Position of P there,
correspond e' positions of Q, and to each of these m poritions of P'; that is, to each pogi-
tion of P there correspond m«' positions of P'; and similarly to each position of P' there
correspond m!'s positions of P. The curve © is the system of the lines drawn from each
of the «' positions of Q to the point O, hence the curve © does not pass through P, and
we have k=0. Therefore the number of the united points (P, P'), that is, the number
of the lines PQ which pass through the point O, is =m#'+m!'z, or this is the class of
the curve enveloped by PQ.
