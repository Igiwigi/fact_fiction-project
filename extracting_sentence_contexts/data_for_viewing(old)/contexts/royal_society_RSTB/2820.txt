are based on comparatively few specimens, sometimes on a single, or even a fragmentary
specimen. The case of the Psilotaceze, plants which have obvious affinities with the
Sphenophylleze, is a warning not to take the number of parts stated for the different
species as absolute or invariable. Thus there is reason to look upon the Sphenophyllez
as a group in which the spore-bearing parts are variable in a high degree.

The strobilus of Sphenophyllum is in most species sharply marked off from the
vegetative region by shorter internodes, by the form of the verticillate leaves, and
by their coherence at the base to form a cup, which, owing to the knee-like angle of
the lower with the upper region, is widened out so as to include the sporangiophores,
while the appressed upper region covers them in. This more differentiated state is,
however, linked with that seen in the non-strobiloid Psilotacese by S. majus on the
ground of the characters above noted ; in fact, as regards forms, S. majus might
almost rank as a verticillate representative of the Psilotaces.* In other species the
strobilus is more clearly differentiated from the foliage region ; the verticils are more
webbed below, and the sporophylls, which are crowded on the shortened axis, differ
widely from the foliage leaves. This condition may be compared with the definite
strobilus in most Lycopods, as against the ‘‘ Selago” condition, and it seems reasonable
to suppose that here, as in Lycopodium, there has been a progression from the less
differentiated to the more differentiated state. With this increasing definition of the
strobilus there. is associated a larger number of the sporangiophores ; but it is to be
noted that where the number of the sporangiophores is larger, the number of the
sporangia which they individually bear is commonly smaller, though there is no strict
numerical relation. ?
