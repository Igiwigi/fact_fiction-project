The idea of a
crystalline “‘ micelle” as put forward by NAGeEttr has been generalized to cover all
lyophilic (gelatine) gels and has aroused much controversy in the field of colloid
chemistry. On the cellulose side, evidence accumulated by X-ray, polarization,
and other methods has placed the existence of some such smaller unit beyond all
reasonable doubt, but there still remains the question of its precise form. By
entirely independent methods Frey (1926, 1930), using the theory of Mixed Bodies
as developed by WreNER (1912), and Meyer and Mark (1928, 1929), came to the
conclusion that the wall did, in fact, consist of long, thin, rod-like aggregates whose
diameter was small compared with the wavelength of light, i.e., ‘“‘ micelles” almost
in the sense of NAcext. It is, however, highly probable that the cellulose micelle
is not a definitely discrete unit separate from its immediate neighbours. The term
