Primary movement of “all toes” was observed 78 times.

(iii.) Character of Movements.

(a.) Absolute.—The first point of interest to be noted in the character of move-
ments of “all toes” is that to which we drew attention, in discussing those of the
hallux (p. 219), viz., that extension is the more frequent movement. Thus, out of
138 simultaneous movements of “all toes,” only 21 were flexion, all the rest being
extension. But a still more remarkable fact is brought out in considering the
localities where these two opposite movements are represented; we have just seen

that the simultaneous movement of “all toes” is most represented in positions exactly
Neomplementary to that of the hallux, it is now interesting to observe that the most
important movement of the digits, 7.e., extension, is characteristic of the chief foci of
-2representation of ‘‘all toes,” while the far rarer movement of flexion is only to be
found in those centres where the primary representation of “all toes” is over-
‘Sshadowed by that of the hallux.

6 The centres where flexion was most observed (arranged in successive order of
Bdecreasing importance) were :—

so closely with that of the absolute movement that it need not be separatel

On referring to Table I. for further details of this list, it is apparent how much less

frequently the movement of small toes is represented than that of “all toes”
hallux, the figures being respectively 92, 138, and 138.
