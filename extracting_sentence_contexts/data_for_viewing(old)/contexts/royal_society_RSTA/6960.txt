diagonal matrices with elements equal to the reciprocals of the corresponding diagonal terms
of D. The degree of ill-conditioning is therefore suggested by the departure of the diagonal
terms Â«,, of A~! from the values 1/a,, (where a,, is a diagonal term of A), and the magnitude
of the off-diagonal elements. It is seen that in the case of the biharmonic equation the degree
of over-relaxation necessary for the liquidation of a residual at the worst point (9 in figure 9),
is a factor of about 20, compared with a factor of 4 for the harmonic equation. When other
residuals are present, moreover, they have a much bigger effect in the former case than in
the latter, and the over-relaxation factor is correspondingly increased.

Most computers would regard as satisfactory a biharmonic solution for which the residuals
had been reduced to the order of unity at each of the points in figure 9, even if they were all
positive, though they might have doubts about the accuracy of a harmonic solution with the
same residuals. Satisfaction with the former comes from the fact that the residual is only
go of the central operator, while dissatisfaction with the latter is associated with the much
larger factor }. Yet it can be seen from tables 2 and 3 that the biharmonic error is 6 units at
the central point, while the harmonic error is only 5 units.

It rarely happens in practice that residuals are reduced to small quantities of the same sign ~
everywhere ;* the effect is usually masked by the presence of residuals of alternating signs

* The difference-correction, however, usually involves the introduction of new residuals of precisely
this form.
