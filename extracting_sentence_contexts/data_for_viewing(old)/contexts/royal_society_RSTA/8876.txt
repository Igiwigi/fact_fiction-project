would make these three points, which were determined in succession at the beginning
of the series, lie so persistently to the right of the graph required by the rest. It seems
likely that we have here another example of a change in the contact potential taking
place during the actual course of the experiments, as in the case of series VI. with COC.
Some of the points in I. x, II. ©, and VI. e might seem to suggest a slower voltage
approach to saturation than the normal, and it was thought that this effect might be

attributable to the rather high gas pressures which developed in these experiments.
The fact that IIT. 4, in which the pressure was kept down to 0-002 by operating the
pumps continuously, does not show this tendency, would seem rather to support such
a contention. An examination in detail of the data, however, isagainstit. For example,
in I. x and VI. e the currents at the high voltages were measured at the lower pressures
and in IL. © conversely. On the whole it seems likely that any such appearance is
illusory and, except in the case of I. x, where a displacement caused by change in
contact potential during the series seems probable, due to chance errors.

It appears, then, that fig. 7 determines the shape of the chlorine characteristics. No
determination of the contact potential with chlorine present has yet been made, so that
the true zero on the volt scale in fig. 7 cannot yet be assigned with certainty. All that
can be said at present is that an examination of the relative positions of the chemical
and of the photo-electric curves which were taken at the same time shows that the true
