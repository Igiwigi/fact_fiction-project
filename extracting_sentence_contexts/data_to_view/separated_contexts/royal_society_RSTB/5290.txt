CORALLIAN ROCKS OF OXFORD, ETC. 161

Borings at Ware, Slough, Winkfield, and many points in and round London, have
revealed that the Corallian disappears in a 8.E. direction [15, ete.]. In fact it is well
established that throughout Jurassic times, except for a temporary transgression
during the Great Oolite, a land-mass existed to the 8.E. of a line not many miles
removed from the present escarpment of the Chalk. This land-mass has received a great deal of attention in the past, and it was roughly
mapped as early as 1856 by Gopwry-AustEN, who supposed it to have extended over the
North Sea and the Scandinavian region throughout the Jurassic Period [12, p. 46].
