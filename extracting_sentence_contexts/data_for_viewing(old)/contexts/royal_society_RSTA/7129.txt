the case when P lies on A will also be included.

In all the three cases IT to IV define the points K,, Z,, MM, and N, to be the intersections, as
shown in figure 3, of A; B, with the lines 4,C;, C, A,, B,D, and D,B,, respectively. The points
K;, L;, M,, N; (i = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) are defined by suitable rotations.

Lemma 8. [/-#' has a point in each of the regions [ Ay, Ey, D,], (By, E>, Ky, My) and (Ay, Ey, Ny, Ly),
thenL’ must have a point either in [Ay, E, By] or in [B,, 1]; the latter case arises only in cases Ill and IV.

In the proof, without explicit mention, use will be made of the fact that for R of type I,
¥' has no point in any of the regions [A,, H,] or [B,, £]. It will then suffice in the proof to
refer to figure 6 only, the relevant parts of which are reproduced here.
