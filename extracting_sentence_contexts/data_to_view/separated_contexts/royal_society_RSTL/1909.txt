Dentition is a sort of natural experiment upon
this function. The general convulsion, the strabismus, the spasm of the fingers
and toes, the croup-like affection of the respiration, the repeated vomitings,
the tenesmus, the strangury, the involuntary discharge of urine and of the
feces, from its operation, denote the influence of irritation of the maxillary
nerves, through the medium of the medulla, upon the muscles of voluntary and
respiratory motion, of the eye, the larynx, the sphincters, &c., in the human snb-
ject, and indicate 80 many arcs of the reflex function. However these facts
may have been known, their true rationale has not been discovered. In all sxuch
cases the remedy is, to relieve the part in which the cause is operating. In the
present instance the maxillary nerves and vessels are to be relieved by free sca-
rification; the lancet should be used freely, daily, or still more frequently.
