he may collect evidence about colours in every possible shape, from the scientific investi-
gations of the philosopher to the artless remarks of the child; he need not go far for an
answer to any question he may choose to put, however abstruse; and as to common facts,
almost every one he meets is a competent witness from whom he may gather them.

I conceive, therefore, that the careful and patient investigation by any colour-blind”
person of his own case, supposing him to embrace the opportunities open to him for”
ascertaining clearly and fully the ordinary facts and impressions regarding colour in
general, is likely to lead to a more faithful representation of the phenomena, than when, |
as is usually the case, the comparison is undertaken by the normal-eyed. |

3. It is not necessary for me to enter into the optical theory of colours generally. TF
only require the means of illustrating, in the simplest manner possible, the facts I have
to bring forward; and this, I conceive, may be sufficiently done by reference to well
known colours in ordinary use. And as it is convenient to adhere to some definite
system of colour-nomenclature, I propose to adopt, for the purposes of the paper, the
popular hypothesis that there are three primary colours, red, blue, and yellow, by
combinations of which all hues in nature may be supposed to be formed.

4. The existence of a defect in the eye, which gives rise to an abnormal vision of
colours, is now well established. Tts nature has been discussed, and descriptions of cases
have been published, within the last few years, by various writers; but it will be suffi-
cient here to refer to the latest, and most complete work on the subject, namely, that by
Professor W1L80N of Edinburgh *, who has made this defect his particular study.
