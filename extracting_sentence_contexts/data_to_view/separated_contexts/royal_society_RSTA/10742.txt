It will therefore be seen that the method adopted resolves itself into this: at any
given temperature, two observations of density and solubility are taken; one is
obtained by stirring a supersaturated solution in contact with the solid salt, the other
by stirring an unsaturated solution in contact with an excess of salt—and the true
density or solubility is considered to be the mean of the two observations. In the earlier part of this work it was found that, in many cases, a very long time
elapsed before the densities obtained, when starting with an unsaturated solution,
approached sufficiently closely to that derived by starting with a supersaturated one—
this was partially remedied by increasing the speed of stirring from 2 to 20 revolutions
per second—but even then there was generally a difference in the two densities of
some few units in the 4th decimal place. The cause of this discrepancy was
eventually traced to the fact that a considerable length of time was also required for
the point of saturation to be attained by a supersaturated solution, even when stirred
in contact with its salt. It was owing to this that some 300 density and solubility
determinations had to be disearded—for preliminary observations had shown that
concordant results could be obtained by merely covering the top of the beaker with a
glass perforated for the stirrer to pass through, and removing the plate while the
pyknometer was being filled. At the higher temperatures the removal of the plate
caused a fall in the temperature of the solution and a consequent supersaturation.
