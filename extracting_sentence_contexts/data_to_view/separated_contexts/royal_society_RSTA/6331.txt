The fourth law, valid in all ranges,
near and far from equilibrium answers an entirely different question than the failed MEPz and it
is important that these two not be conflated. To miss this point is not only to misunderstand the
physics but the whole origin, nature and evolution of life and cognition. Confusions concerning Prigogine’s minEP principle (which does not, in fact, conflict with
LMEP) and Jayne’s MaxEnt, an information-theoretical inference method are discussed elsewhere
[20,31]. References
