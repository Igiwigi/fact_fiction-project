The ethylation product is thus either a triethyl ester or a monoethyl ether of a diethyl
ester. It was shown that the product does not contain an ethoxyl group, by hydrolysing a
quantity of it with boiling alcoholic sodium hydroxide. The regenerated acid melted
at 132° C., gave an equivalent of 121-2, and was unchanged hydrolysed Substance
“A.” Hence, this ethylation product is the triethyl ester of hydrolysed Substance
“A.” This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that this product is insoluble in sodium
hydroxide. 4. Attempted methylation of the triethyl ester of hydrolysed “ A” with methyl iodide
and silver owide.
