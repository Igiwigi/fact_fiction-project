It
is self-adjoint if and only if c=0, in which case it coincides with the classic momentum operator
po of quantum mechanics, acting on Ho =L?(R) and with spectrum o (po) = R; e.g. [80,107,110]. Similarly, if we let —Ac = (pc)? = —(dc)* denote the free c-Hamiltonian, then the group {e~!"**}

is unitary if and only if c=0.

We can next proceed to rigorously define the spectral operator a= ac by the expression ac :=
(dc) or, more concisely, a:= ¢(d), in the sense of the functional calculus for unbounded normal
operators (e.g. [104]). Of course, we are using here the fact that (according to theorem 4.1 above),
d¢ is an unbounded normal operator. Note that, by definition, the domain of a is given by D(a) =
{f € H.: af € H,}. In the sequel, cé(E) denotes the closure of E ¢ C in C.
