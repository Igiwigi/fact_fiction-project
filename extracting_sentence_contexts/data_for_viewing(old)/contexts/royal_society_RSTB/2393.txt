phots. 14-16, the dimensions of the functional megaspore in its natural condition were considerably
greater.

+ Witi1AMson found some remains of “ perispermic tissue” (= endosperm) in the solid specimen of
his Cardiocarpon anomalum (loc. cit., Part VII., p. 255, figs. 117, 120). As stated above, this “seed,” like the
others figured by WILLIAMSON under the same name, is no doubt our Lepidocarpon Lomazi, but from the
nature of the specimen the evidence as to the presence of endosperm is inconclusive.

signs of archegonia. I could not, however, satisfy myselt that this specimen is really
a Lepidocarpon, though the fact that the nucellus or sporangium is free from the
integument down to its base is in favour of this attribution. From WILLIAMson’s
remarks,* it appears that he referred this specimen to his Cardiocurpon Butterworthi,
which, from its cylindrical stalk, must have been of quite a different nature from a
Lepidocarpon, and may rather have been related to the true Cardiocarpon of
Bronentart and Carrutuers. In any case, the nature of Writtamson’s prothallus-
containing seed must for the present be left an open question.

Some general considerations as to the prothallus of Lepidocarpon will be postponed
to the conclusion of the paper, after the other species, Z. Wildianum, has been

described. f
