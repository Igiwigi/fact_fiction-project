derive the wind profile, consisting of altitudinal segments of
wind speed and direction. Depending on flight altitude of the
bird being tracked, the anemometer wind was used for low
flying birds (15 m or below), while balloon tracked winds were
used for flight altitudes above 15 m. We recorded the ambient
air temperature and pressure at the observer's position using a

to the incident side wind [14]. However, this predicted adjust-
ment of airspeed according to side winds, more specifically to
the angle between track and heading, has to the best of our
knowledge never been observed in birds thus far. Possibly,
this depends on the fact that the birds in studies where this pre-

dicted effect was tested for failed to compensate for wind drift pocket weather meter (Kestrel 4500NV), and updated data regu-
and therefore exhibited partial drift, thus not fulfilling the larly during a session. Following the completion of each run,

recorded as ‘straight flapping flight’ were included. Terns that
are searching for food are characteristically flying with their
beak pointing downwards, which makes it easy to distinguish
food search from other flight activities, where the beak/head is
