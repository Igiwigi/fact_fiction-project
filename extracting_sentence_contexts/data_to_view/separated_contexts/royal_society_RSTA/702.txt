Zheng
et al. [40] concluded that linear correlations of dissolved REEs and Si in Atlantic deep waters
are due to predominantly conservative behaviour of both elements rather than similar chemical
behaviour. This point is further supported by the data compiled in figure 4b. In fact, Atlantic deep

water layers around the world, and are not observed at all locations in the Pacific Ocean.
