"The first column contains simply KIRCHHOFF'S Measures ; and the second contains the
corresponding wave-lengths, computed by the process described above. The third
column contains Kircunory's symbols expressing the darkness and the breadth of the
lines; 1 expresses a slight darkness, 2 a little darker, and 80 on up to 6 which is very
dark; « denotes a very narrow line, 6 a little broader, and 80 on up to 9g, which is a line
of considerable breadth (the measure of the breadth is not given). The fourth column
(where it is used) contains the contracted name of the metal which, by combustion, pro-

duces a line corresponding in spectral position to the line here measured. This Table
is, in fact, Kixcanopy's Table, with the insertion throughout of one column containing
the computed values of the wave-lengths. In copying the first column, T have endea-
voured to copy the” braces and brackets of Kircnnopy's Table, without in every cage
understanding their application.

The Table which next follows is Kixcnnory's special Table for the lines produced by
the metals Cerium, Didymium, Lanthanum, Palladium, Platinum, Ruthenium, Iridium,
with the corresponding wave-lengths. Two of its compartments contain the lines in a
combination of Lanthanum and Didymium, and in a combination of Ruthenium and
Iridium. It is accompanied by a similar Table of lines produced by the atmosphere.

The next Table (formed by myself) contains the wave-lengths for each of the metals
whose lines have been measured by K1RcnHnory, and are contained either in the General
