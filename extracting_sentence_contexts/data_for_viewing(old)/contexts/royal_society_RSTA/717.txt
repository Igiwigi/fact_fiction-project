For this map, transient chaos can be observed in the interval z;, € [27.3, 30.7], so we have chosen DS
this interval as the set Qo. We have taken & = 0.080. If the control bound up is chosen too small, : =

there will be no safe set, and it will be impossible to prevent escapes. In this case, we have taken
as the control bound up = 0.055 (ug < 9), which is approximately the minimum value for which
a safe set exists. Then, we have obtained the safe set by using the recursive sculpting algorithm.
In figure 6, we can see how the algorithm sculpts the initial region Qo until it finds Q4 where it
converges, SO Q4 = Qou is the safe set. For this computation, we have used a grid of 4000 points in
the interval z,, € [26.8, 30.8], so the grid resolution is 0.001.

The safe set computed ensures for any starting point qn in the safe set and any allowable én,
there is a wu, that puts f(qn) + &n + Un back in the safe set. This is true for the map; however, the
control is applied in the phase space so we must take into account of the fact that as each local
maximum of z is described by three coordinates (Xin, Ym,Zm), the total distance to the safe set

isd= J (Xm = Xmsafe)? + (Ym — Ymnsate)* + (Zm — Zmsafe)*, Where (Xmsafer Ymsafer Zmsafe) iS the closest
point belonging to the safe set. In figure 7, we show a controlled time series of the z variable in
contrast with an uncontrolled trajectory. We can see that chaos is sustained by applying small
perturbations in the maxima of the variable z.

The main advantage of this 1D approach is that the computation of the safe set is easy and fast.
This kind of map is useful when the disturbed trajectories mainly spread out along the expanding
direction of the chaotic saddle, as occurs in the case of stochastic noise or uncertainties in the
application of the controls. See, for example, in [11], where an ecological model of three species
was studied. In that case, it was possible to construct a map of the form (xj, y;,2;), where y and z
