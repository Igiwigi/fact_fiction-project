trend is confirmed by the latest projections from the CMIP5 ESMs, with reductions in the ocean
Oy inventory from 1.5 to 4% in 2090s relative to 1990s for all future scenarios. Largest declines
are concentrated at mid-depths in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Southern Ocean. The
processes at play are linked to surface ocean warming, which reduces both O2 solubility and

the rate at which the surface waters are transported downward. However, large uncertainties : =

and model estimates of the Last Glacial Maximum ocean oxygenation to gain some insights _
into the major mechanisms of oxygenation changes across these different time scales. They show : Ss
that the primary uncertainty on future ocean deoxygenation in the subsurface tropical oceans Dh

the corresponding water masses. Modelled short-term natural variability in subsurface oxygen
levels also reveals a compensation between oxygen saturation and AOU, controlled by the
latter. Finally, using a model simulation of the Last Glacial Maximum, reproducing data-based
reconstructions of past ocean (de)oxygenation, they show that the deoxygenation trend of the
subsurface ocean during the deglaciation was controlled by a combination of warming-induced
decreasing oxygen saturation and increasing AOU driven by a reduced ventilation of tropical
subsurface waters.

The basic need for improved understanding of ventilation processes was addressed by
Naveira-Garabato [12], who drew attention to the very different mechanisms of water mass
