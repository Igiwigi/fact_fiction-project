Monochlorobenzene.

‘This compound causes a powerful effect upon reflex ; it is, in fact, one of the most
active bodies in the series. In about one-half of the experiments a shortening of the
reflex period was produced immediately after injection. The reduction varied from
5 second to 1°5 second, and was never present for more than 30 minutes after the
injection had been made. After this temporary reduction, or an alternative equality.
ov slight lengthening of reflex, a very rapid change took place, the period of reflex
increasing considerably with every estimation. Spontaneous spreading of toes and
jerking of feet and legs were developed in all cases, and this condition was increased
by immersion in the acid solutions, and sometimes persisted for a time in exaggerated
form after washing with cold water. Immersing suddenly in water caused an active
instantaneous jerk. In several experiments the ligatured leg, though as much affected
in this respect as the unligatured, was stronger in its reaction, and, spite of diminished
irritability from stasis, came to respond by withdrawal more rapidly than the other,
