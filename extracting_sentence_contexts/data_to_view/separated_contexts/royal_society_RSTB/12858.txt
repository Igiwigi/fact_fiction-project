They We now turn ourattention toa set of issues that go to the heart of
found rapid neocortical consolidation of schema-consistent questions about the role of experience replay in neocortical con-
information in that their animals learned to map a new flavour solidation, starting from an issue that we raised in McClelland
onto a place in a familiar environment. Importantly, we note et al. [7]. There we considered the fact that integration of new
that the places animals had to associate with these new flavours knowledge without interference into a neocortex-like network
were immediately adjacent to places already associated with pre- required interleaving with items previously learned, and we
viously learned flavours. For all practical purposes, the animals have just illustrated this point again in our new simulations
could have mapped the new flavours exactly onto the familiar with the sparrowhawk. We have refined the analysis to make
adjacent places since they would have effectively reached the clear that some aspects of information about a new item can
new places by navigating to the already familiar ones.
