Thus, the resulting
macroscopic behaviour may not display any stick-slip behaviour and can have extremely small
hysteresis. In the intermediate case—Case G—where the two length scales are comparable, there is close
interaction between the phase boundary and the heterogeneity resulting in a range of behaviours. We show through numerical simulation that the amount of hysteresis can vary widely, and
relation between the relative heterogeneity size and the critical depinning stress can in fact be
non-monotone. An insight that comes from this analysis is that a potential route to making materials with
low hysteresis is to introduce heterogeneities at a length scale that is small compared with the
width of the phase boundary. This is seemingly counterintuitive because pinning and increased
hysteresis is well documented in the widely studied sharp interface (large heterogeneity) case.
