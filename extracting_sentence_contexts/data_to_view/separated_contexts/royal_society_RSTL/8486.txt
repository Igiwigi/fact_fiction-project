It retains its instincts of self-preservation, retains its appetites, and continues
to seek its food. Tt is also capable of exhibiting various emotions. The result, therefore,
is almost negative, and the removal of a part of the brain which gives no external response
to electric stimulation exercises no striking positive effect; and yet the facts seem to
warrant the conclusion that a decided change is produced in the animal's character and
disposition. For this operation I elected the most active, lively, and intelligent animals
which I could obtain. 'To one seeing the animals after the removal of their frontal
lobes little effect might be perceptible, and beyond some dulness and inactivity they
might seem fairly up to the average of monkey intelligence. They seemed to me, after
having studied their character carefully before and after the operation, to have under-
gone a great change.
