In biology, we are today at the stage at which physics was at the time of Benjamin Franklin, :B
when it became clear that electricity is everywhere in Nature and yet it was considered an :s

extravagance. In a similar way, the dominant view today is that molecular copying is the sole
fundamental mechanism of life and the genetic code is an extraordinary singularity.

What is coming to light, instead, is that molecular copying and molecular coding (natural
selection and natural conventions) are equally fundamental mechanisms. The world of molecular
coding, in other words, is the other side of life that so far has remained hidden from sight just as
electromagnetism was in the times of Newton and Franklin.

It should be added that mathematical models did have a role in the rise of electromagnetism,
and it was in fact those models that illuminated the experimental data. The model of the
reconstruction of structures from incomplete information has nothing to do with the flesh and
blood of embryonic development, and yet it is the only one, so far, that makes us understand how
a convergent increase in complexity can take place.
