are specially modified nerve fibres which have probably assumed a supporting
function.”

Biitow (1883, p. 92) concluded that the neurochords in Zwmbriculus are not of
nervous nature, but are elastic structures, not, however, homologous with the chorda
of Vertebrates (see above, p. 441, footnote). MIcHAELSEN (1886, p. 33) observed muscle fibrils running along the dorsal wall of
the single large neurochord in Pachydrilus beumeri, and argued from this fact that
the neurochord functions as a supporting organ.

E1sta (1887) regarded the neurochord, after the degeneration of the nerve fibres
which it originally contained, as a supporting structure, a view adopted by Lane
(1894) and Perrier (1897) (see above, p. 439). JourpDan (1887, p. 262) concluded that there were no nervous structures in the
giant fibre of Hunice, and, consequently, he could not regard it as a nerve tube, but
considered it to be a supporting structure.

CUNNINGHAM (1888, p. 275) failed to establish any connection between the
ganglion cells and neural canals of certain Polycheetes. He regarded the canals as

supporting elements which serve to prevent the nerve cord being bent at a sharp

angle: the cord thus escapes injury during the wriggling of the worm.
