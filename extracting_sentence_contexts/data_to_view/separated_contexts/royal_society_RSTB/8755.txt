Figure 2. Time-aligned map showing consonant and vowel interval durations for ‘Tony knew you were lying in bed’ for a control (a), two ataxic (b,c) and one PD
speaker (d), as well as nPVI-V values for these speakers. % = intra-utterance pause; for ease of reference, the productions have been transcribed orthographically. Please note that segments in brackets were not produced by the speakers and the final consonant in ‘bed’ was excluded from analysis. (Online version in colour.)
