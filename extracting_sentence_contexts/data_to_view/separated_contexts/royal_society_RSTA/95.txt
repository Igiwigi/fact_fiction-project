In quantum field theory,
however, the physics is unchanged by a more general space-time-dependent transformation:

v(tn) > v(t net, (4.2)

provided that a compensating transformation is applied to the electromagnetic potentials. This idea of replacing a global by a local symmetry, often called the ‘gauge principle’, provides
a sort of rationale for the existence of the electromagnetic field; without that field, the extension is
not possible. Moreover, it was also seen as offering an explanation for the fact that the quantum
of the electromagnetic field, the photon, is massless, in the sense of having zero rest-mass; in
vacuum it cannot ever be at rest, and its minimum energy is zero. This is because the gauge
principle does not work if we add a mass term. That yields a theory that cannot be renormalized,
so it is inconsistent in the sense of giving infinite answers to physical questions.
