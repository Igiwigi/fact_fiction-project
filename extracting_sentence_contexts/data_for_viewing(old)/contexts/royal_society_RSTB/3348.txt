owe their formation to the influence of sea water. In the light of this view let us
further examine the chemical composition of the structures as revealed hy the series
of analyses.

Detailed Consideration of Analyses.

As Table I, p. 198, shows, the coal balls are principally made up of calcium and
magnesium carbonates, in many cases in the proportion in which these carbonates occur
in dolomite, though there is considerable variation, In general, the carbonates taken
together, whatever their individual proportions may be, form 90 per cent. or more of
the whole mass of the coal ball. In some localities, however, iron pyrites figures largely
in the nodules, particularly in those found in the Halifax district, and there is
commonly a small proportion of iron carbonate. Itis an important fact that quartz is
absent, and that the amount of alumina and silicates is so minute as to be a negligible
quantity, except for purposes of minute analysis, thus showing that muddy or detrital
matter was absent from the mass of material which was petrified as “ coal balls,” and
that practically pure plant masses were mineralised by the dolomite or mixture of
carbonates. The amount of carbonaceous matter left as such in the mass is very
various, and it is probable that it depends on the state of perfection that the
mineralisation had reached (see p. 200).

The presence of iron pyrites is so common in beds which are rich in fossils, and
so frequently results from later reactions, that it need not be taken into account in
dealing with the theoretical side of the question of the formation of the coal balls.
As is seen from the tables of analyses, the percentage of pyrites varies ; analyses are
