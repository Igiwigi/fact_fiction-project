in these industries, it can also be used for heat and power generation in the most energy-intensive
industries (e.g. steel, chemicals). With such levels of use in high-carbon-intensity industries,
decarbonizing hydrogen production can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of fuels and
manufactured products.

3. Hydrogen pathways in renewable energy integrated systems

Intermittent power generation from renewable energy technologies requires storage technologies
that can provide storage capacity to balance supply and demand, with frequency control and
other benefits such as curtailment minimization, demand-side management, contingency grid
support, etc. [73]. Studies show the economic benefits of implementing storage to manage high
levels of renewable electricity generation (e.g. in the UK £10bnyr~! saving can potentially be
realized with storage technologies in a 2050 high renewable energy scenario) [74]. In fact, the cost
of wind power curtailment is increasing as their penetration increases; in 2014 Germany spent
€82m on electricity curtailment from wind power, and this cost is reported to be doubling every
year [75]. Besides hydrogen, several different technologies are being investigated for grid-scale
electricity storage including lithium ion batteries, redox flow batteries, compressed air energy
storage, supercapacitors, thermal energy storage and flywheels. See the UK white paper [76] on
grid-scale energy storage for more information on these technologies.

Hydrogen offers several advantages over other grid-scale storage options. Firstly, the use of
hydrogen in the power or gas grid offers the opportunity to decarbonize all economic sectors.
Secondly, hydrogen can store larger amounts of energy per unit volume than other large-
scale energy storage options being considered: it has over 200 times the volumetric energy
storage density of pumped hydro storage and 50 times that of compressed air [76]; see figure 1
