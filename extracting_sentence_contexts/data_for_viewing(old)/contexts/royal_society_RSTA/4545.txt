managing information

Although there is a disparity between the actual implications of uncertainty and people’s
intuitions and behaviours, effective communication can make the implications of uncertainty
more easily understood. This was first recognized by Fischhoff [58], who acknowledged
the possibility that focusing on uncertainties may discourage action and distract people
from decision-making. However, Fischhoff also points out that reframing the debate in
terms of ‘what gambles we want to take with the natural world’ (p. 703) could galvanize
decisions.

In this issue, the article by Ballard & Lewandowsky [59] also addresses the notion of how

reframing uncertainty can enhance people’s responses to climate change. They highlight the fact : 2
that projections typically express uncertainty in the outcome itself, but not in the outcome’s time : =
of arrival. For example, projections reported by the IPCC generally imply statements along the {5
lines of ‘by year X, average global surface temperature will rise by between Y1 and Y2 degrees’. bo
The authors argue that reporting projections in this manner invites wishful thinking, because it : <
increases the perceived variance in the outcome. Reframing this projection so that the uncertainty Do
is expressed in the time of arrival can reduce the potential for wishful thinking. For example, the : Ss
projection above can be re-expressed as ‘average global surface temperature will rise by Y degrees, : &
and this will occur between years X1 and X2’. In other words, the projection emphasizes the when : s
rather than the if. Ballard & Lewandowsky demonstrate that when uncertainty is expressed in this : s

manner, people perceive the consequences of climate change to be more serious, and show greater
endorsement of mitigative action.
