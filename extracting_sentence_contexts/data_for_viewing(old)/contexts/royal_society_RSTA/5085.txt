small pre-strain at an elevated temperature would not affect the yield stress at a lower
temperature. It was shown that the cross-slipped segments were thermally reversible. In
essence, a material with a kind of reverse memory effect.

Clearly, the nature of the precipitates has a major effect on the deformation mechanisms and
strength properties of Ni-base superalloys and in fact is responsible for the high-temperature
strength of these alloys.

4. Cyclic deformation of Ni-base superalloys

As will be discussed in subsequent sections, the mode of deformation is intrinsically important
in determining damage mechanisms and the fatigue life and also in influencing the severity of
environmental damage and interactions. In this section, some of the most important aspects of
cyclic deformation are reviewed. A recent general review on this and other topics [25] as well as
a detailed review of cyclic deformation in Ni-base superalloys [18] is available.
