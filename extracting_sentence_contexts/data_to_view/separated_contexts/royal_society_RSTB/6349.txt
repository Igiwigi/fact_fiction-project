With this species there is evidence that the nesting season on Ascension begins a little
earlier in each successive year, and that the change in time is sufficient to make the
birds breed on the average four times within three years. It would seem as if in
this species breeding periodicity depended entirely upon an internal sexual rhythm
unaffected by seasonal exteroceptive factors. Murpuy also records some facts
about the periodic breeding of certain species of penguins which are in striking
contrast to the great majority of birds. The Peruvian and African penguins, that
is, the two members of the genus Spheniscus which, coming presumably from the
south, have invaded warm-temperate and tropical environments, may have two
broods of young, nearly the whole of the year being occupied in breeding operations. Kearton (1930), says that the African penguins have mating seasons in February
and in September.
