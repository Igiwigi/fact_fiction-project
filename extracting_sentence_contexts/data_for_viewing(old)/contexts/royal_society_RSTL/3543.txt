corpuscle of the blood in certain states exhibits an orifice, by means of which there is
a communication between the exterior of the corpuscle and the cavity in its nucleus.

59. The free portion of the germinal spot resolves itself into discoid objects—the
foundations of cells ; with which the germinal vesicle becomes filled. In like manner,
the blood-corpuscle is seen filled with corpuscles of minuter size ; presenting an ap-
pearance which I can attribute to no other than the same process. This is shown in
the blood-corpuscle of the Fish at y, fig. 52, at « and Þ, fig. 53, and at £ andC, fig. 54
—in that of the Reptile, e, figs. 49 and 50—in that of the Bird, fig. 36 Þ, fig. 41 B,
fig. 43 Þ, y, fig. 45, and fig. 47.

60. The foundation of the new being in the mammiferous oyum, arising in the
centre of the altered germinal spot—which centre, from this and other facts, I deno-
minated the point of feeundation—we saw to consist of two disecs ; each of these discs
giving origin to a cell. So alse, in more than half the numerous figures accompany-
ing this memoir, we find the same appearances in blood-corpuseles, including those
of Man. (In certain states, the nucleus of the blood-corpuscle is composed of three
or more discs, instead of two. Figs. 33, 34 y,41 þ, 43 3, 45 0,4, 52 y, 3,53 «, 54 £. Com-
pare with the nucleus of a yelk-globule from an immature oyum of the Tiger in my
Second Series on the Embryo).

61. The two cells in question, in the ovum, at a certain period are set free; each
being destined to give origin to others. Such also is the case with the corpuscles of
the blood. See figs. 29, 30, 39, 41 y.
