Now it is manifest that, in
the experiments already mentioned, the yoltaic elements haye the power of exhibiting
electric effects at either, and both ends or terminals, before any progression or actual
perceptible force takes place in the course of the series ; in other words, that sfatic
effects exist before or independently of currents, but that these effects cease imme-
diately on currents being developed.

21. But, in an inquiry like this, we must examine more closely the actual chemical
action ; for it involves much of the source of controversy between the contact and

, chemical theories ; and I was naturally anxious to discover whether simultaneously
with these s/atic effects, or perhaps antecedently to them, any chemical action took
place in the cells of the battery ; and if 80, to what amount.

22. Farapay}, in the course of that branch of his experimental researches which
introduced into notice the voltameter, established the most accurate means of mea-
suring the amount of chemical action in the battery cells, by the equivalent amount
of chemical decomposition exhibited in that instrument ; he has also directed our
attention to the fact, that this amonnt of electro-chemical decomposition depends
essentially on the current as denoted by the galvanometer. There was every reason,
with these facts before us, to expect that the battery, which did not produce a current,
would not evince any degree of chemical decomposition. Recourse was, however,
had to the test of experiment ; and, instead of introducing the galvanometer, I snb-
stituted for it a small piece of bibulous paper, saturated with a soJution of iodide of
potassium ; the gold leaves of the electroscope diverged as before, but, however long
the duration of action, not the least indication of the liberation of iodine was per-
ceptible.
