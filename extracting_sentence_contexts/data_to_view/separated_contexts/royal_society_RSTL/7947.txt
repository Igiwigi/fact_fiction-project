The extreme diffi-
culty of any thing like a general deductive investigation of the question is no doubt one
reason. On the other hand, experimenters on this, as on other subjects, have too often
observed and measured blindly without taking sufficient care to simplify the conditions
of their experiments, s0 as to attack as few difficulties as possible at a time. The result

= has been vast accumulations of isolated facts and measurements which lie as a sort of
'S dead weight on the scientific stomach, and which must remain undigested until theory
S 8upplies a more powerful solyent than any now at our command. The motion of the
E air in cylindical organ-pipes was successfully inyestigated by BERNOULLI and EULER, at
'Z least in its main features; but their treatment of. the question of the open pipe was
Z incomplete, or even erroneous, on account of the assnumption that at the open end the
D air remains of inyariable density during the vibration.
