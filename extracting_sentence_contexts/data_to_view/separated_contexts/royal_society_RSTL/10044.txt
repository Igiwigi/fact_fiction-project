At the end of the Zo#a series four pairs of pereiopods, the first, second, third,
and fourth, are represented by buds (figs. 43 and 45), while the fifth is entirely absent,
as DANA pointed out in the © Report on the Crustacea collected by the United States
Exploring Expedition,” p. 634, WiLLEM6Es-SUBM (Proc. Roy. Soc., vol. 24, p. 134),
calls attention to the 8ame fact : the total absence of this somite ab all stages of
development. In the Schizopod stage each of these appendages is biramous (fig. 59),
and similar to the last maxilliped, although the first three pairs (fig. 59, Pr. 1, Pr. 2,
and Pr. 3) are longer. At the end of the Schizopod series of stages the entire fourth pair and the exopo-
dites of the other three pairs disappear, and the endopodites lengthen to form the
long slender limbs of the adult (fig. 61, Pr. 1, Pr. 2, and Pr. 3).
