To explain this fact he
suggested (1868) that the outgrowth of primordia produced a tension in the outer cell
walls, which tended to resist the outgrowth of further primordia. Each primordium,
therefore, arose in a position where the tension was at a minimum and thus came to
occupy the space that was farthest removed from the previous primordia. This theory
has received no further support, but the observation that leaves arise in the largest
gap has been accepted as a fundamental fact by several later writers. ScHWENDENER realised the truth of HormetstErâ€™s law, but considered that the latter
had exaggerated its importance as a factor determining leaf arrangement (1878). In
addition, he considered the following factors to be of fundamental importance : (1) The
establishment of contact between a young primordium and at least two neighbouring
leaves at the end of its first growth phase.
