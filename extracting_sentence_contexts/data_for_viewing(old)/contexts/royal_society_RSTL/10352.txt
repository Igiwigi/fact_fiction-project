Coffea, Galium, and Asperula (Plate 70, fig. 31) is of some interest. The cell-walls
present, a somewhat crumpled appearance, and there is no definite arrangement in
their shape. After treatment with strong iodine and a lengthy action of Chlor. Zine
Tod., a 8ystem of fine threads is clearly brought into view. Where the wall is pitted,
the threads go through the pits, or, if not, through the thick wall, as the case may be.
This was observed in Asperula only. The rest were not examined in detail,

The structure of the seeds of Tamus and Diascorea are very important as affording
additional confirmation of Taxcr's results with Strychnos. The thick walls of these
s8eeds present no pits, and are of the same transparent horny nature as those of
Strychnos Tqnatia. After treatment with iodine and Chlor. Zinc Tod. the very numerous
threads which freely perforate the entire thickness of the cell-wall gradually come into
view, and resemble in both arrangement and properties those of Strychnos. The fact
that the threads cross the middle lamella is even better demonstrated in Tamus than
in the former instance, for here the development of the lamella is not 80 great. The
cell-walls s00n swell very strongly, and in 80 doing the threads are broken up into'a
number of points, as TAx6L has observed, and in the swollen portion of the wall ab
last become invisible (Plate 70, fig. 33). In Dioscorea the threads are much finer than
in either Strychnos or Tamus. In both instances threads can be observed uniting all

the cells, including of course those directly below the surface, In this respect they
differ from Strychnos as far as their demonstrable character goes.
