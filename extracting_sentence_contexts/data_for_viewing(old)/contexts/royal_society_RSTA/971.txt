be derived from the percolation statistics of the vacancy clusters [14]. The Weibull distribution
arises if the defect size distribution follows a power law. This happens close to the percolation
threshold [15] up to the correlation length of percolation or if there is a significant long-range
correlation in defect formation. Gumbell distribution, on the other hand, results if the probability
of a vacancy cluster of size / falls off exponentially with |. This happens when q — 0. Though
simulational and experimental results seem to satisfy Gumbell distribution more, for most brittle
fractures and for simulations at low q-values, it is extremely difficult to differentiate between the
two behaviours [9]. For large q-values and at the percolation regime, none of these distributions
work. We discuss the case of high-defect density next.

(b) High-defect density

When the defect density is high, one cannot treat a defect independent of the others. In fact, close
to the percolation point, where the broken bonds in the network start percolating, one cannot
pick out any single critical defect. Fracture, in this situation, is a highly cooperative process. The
critical theory and the scaling ideas of percolation phenomena can be used, at this limit, to predict
the distribution of the strength of a material. As before, the system is taken to be a lattice and the
disorder is introduced by removing bonds randomly with a concentration p. In the percolating
