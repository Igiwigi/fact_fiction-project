The cloacal membrane, according to FLorran (1928, a,
p- 545; 1930, 6), is to be found in sections 60-62 (figs. 31-32 in Srmeve’s paper),
its connection with the endoderm being close to the point designated in Srreve’s
fig. 31 as “ Sichelknoten,” the connection with the ectoderm in fig. 32 being designated
as “ Blutinsel”” ; the connection between these two is present in section 61, the figure
of which was not published. If we observe the position of the primitive streak in
Srreve’s figures, we notice that as we pass back in the series the streak gradually
approaches nearer to the right margin of the embryonal shield ; the cloacal membrane
(in Srteve’s fig. 31) being situated actually at that margin. This fact clearly indicates
