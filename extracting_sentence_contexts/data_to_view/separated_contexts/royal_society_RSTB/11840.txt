In these assays, tension
anical signals (such as those usually present in three- most likely increases both in the PM and in the underlying
dimensional geometries). Therefore, we limit the review to cytoskeletal actin cortex. The CSK is in fact thought to have
two-dimensional in vitro systems and examine the acute mechano protective effects on the poorly extensible PM,
response of mammalian cells to a single mechanical input. which resists only a 3â€”5% area expansion before lysis, or rup-

ture [8,28]. The CSK prevents tension-induced PM rupture by
absorbing part of the applied stress [33,37]. Consistently,
