species can be represented with the present model (e.g. growth factors) and, if desired, necrosis


can be regarded as apoptosis, at least to some extent. Therefore, we now inspect the effects
of cell death in the model. To this end, we increase the value of Opec from almost zero to 0.5.
Obviously, the increase of necrosis facilitates the labour of the immune system. As shown in
figure 7, the elimination region enlarges substantially, compared with the reference case. Also in
the equilibrium region, lower tumour cell numbers are seen before the escape of the tumour. More
importantly, the equilibrium window, which has been associated with large periods of tumour
mass latency, is practically imperceptible for f =1.0 and has completely vanished for f = 0.05.
We have again computed time series, showing that transients occur in the equilibrium region,
sometimes as long as those appearing before in the equilibrium, but generally shorter (figure 8).
In fact, the equilibrium window and the escape zone drawn in figure 7a overlap. It seems that
the equilibrium region appearing in the reference scenario has been swept under the elimination
region. Once more, the results confirm the requisite of a relatively delicate balance between the
mechanisms that maintain the cytotoxic destruction of the immune system and the growth of the =
tumour, in order to keep it at low cell numbers for long periods of time. : 3

We have studied the transient and asymptotic dynamics of a CA model for tumour-immune : 4
interactions. We have shown that, depending on the immunogenicity of the tumour, the model :
furnishes three main types of dynamics, which are in close relationship with the three phases : a
of the theory of immunoedition. Importantly, we have shown that a dynamical equilibrium : 8
between the tumour can occur for long periods of time, as proposed by Kuznetsov et al. [16].
