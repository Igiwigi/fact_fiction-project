We find that extinction times increase with increasing K for
all parameters. However, for parameter combinations that cor-
respond to extinction in the large rpK limit (i.e. to the right of the
dashed lines), this increase is approximately linear in K, while
for parameters leading to metastability in the large roK limit
(left of dashed lines), this increase is faster than linear. In fact,
in the metastable regime, even with a carrying capacity K of a
few thousand individuals, demographic stochasticity will be
sufficiently weak and extinction times large enough that isolated
populations can persist over geological timescales: for these
parameter regimes, it is environmental fluctuations (which our
model ignores), rather than mutation load or demographic
stochasticity, that will primarily influence extinction risk. We also compute the average (scaled) population size N =
n/K in the metastable state (figure 1c). This declines with
increasing 2LU, i.e. as we approach the threshold for loss of
metastability, and is close to the semi-deterministic prediction
(dashed black lines) for all values of K.

(b) Effect of migration on equilibrium population sizes
and genetic load

We now consider how migration from a large mainland influ-
ences population dynamics on the island, for different genetic
architectures of load, i.e. given certain selective effects and
dominance coefficients of deleterious alleles.
