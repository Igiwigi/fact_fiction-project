The female, by this mark, may be readily distinguished from the male, the
colour of which is brownish or greenish*. From these statements it follows that the
segmental organ in Sabella and Serpula are permanent VISOO, and not temporary forma-
tions, as affirmed by DE QUATREFAGES. In fact, it is a mistake to suppose that the Pro-
cess of ova- and sperm-development, in any Annelid, is limited to a month or two in the
year. Ova in an immature state are found in the bodies of the youngest as of the
oldest. This fact proves that the structures by which the ova are generated must be
permanently present.
