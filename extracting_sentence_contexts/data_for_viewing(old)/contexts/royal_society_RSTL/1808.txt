the very contrary, and even speaks of that which is the exhauster, as the re-
pairer, of the irritability; whilst, on the other hand, he makes statements which
appear to me at variance with this very opinion. In the Anatomie Comparte
(tome i. p. 49), this celebrated writer observes, © Les experiences modernes ont
montr6 qu'un des principaux usages de la respiration est de ranimer Ja force
musculaire, en rendant a la fibre son irritabilit6 epuis6e.” See also tome iv.
P- 301. Similar obseryations are made in M. Cuvier's more recent work, the
Rdgne Animal : © Cest de la respiration que les fibres musculaires tirent I'ener-
gie de leur irritabilit6.” tome i. p. 57. 2%* edit. © Ceest la respiration qui donne
au sang 8a chalenr, et a la fibre la susceptibilit6 pour Tirritation nerveuse.”
tome ii. p. 1. On the other hand, speaking of the mollusca, (tome iii. p. 3.)
M. Cuvizr observes of those animals of low respiration, © Lirritabilit6 est
extreme dans la plupart.” The same term is, in fact, used in two distinet
s8enses, in these paragraphs.

No further proof can be necessary of the extreme vagueness and incorrect-

* Since this paper was read, science has experienced an irreparable loss in the death of this great
man. I will not imagine that my comments upon what I conceive to be an error in his writings will
be misinterpreted. No one can look upon Cuv1zs's labours with more zincere admiration than myself.
