Hown i in Plate XXXVIII. fig. 4, this has all the characters of immaturity ($ 67); and

54. Pinne.â€”The pinnules with which the Arms are fringed ( Plates XXXVIL. figs.
1,2, 3, XXXVIIL. figs. 4, 10, 11) are composed of articulated segments nearly cylin-
Arical in form, and gradually tapering from their base to their extremity, which bears a
peculiar segment furnished with five or six minute hooks (Plate XXX VIII. tig. 3).
The 8ize and length of the pinnules vary considerably in different parts of the Arm,
those near the base being not, only longer, but also stouter in proportion to their length.
The firs: pair of pinnules, which are attached to the Second Brachial segments, are
"much longer than those which succeed, often in fact attaining double their length ; and
'these, as already mentioned, are nearly always secen in the living state bending over the
ventral disk (Plate XXXTI. fig. a). The first segment, which is articulated to the Brachial


segment that bears it by ligaments only, is much shorter than that which follows it .
(Plate XXXVII. fig. 3); and the length of the succeeding segments presents a Cons |
derable uniformity, until we approach the termination of the pinnule, where we often
tind a set of segments much shorter than the rest (Plate XXXVIII. fig. 3), suggesting
the idea that these are the last formed. The number of segments in the pinnules is
found by no means constant, when we compare either different pinnules of the Same
Arm, or corresponding pinnules in different individuals. Thus the firs, which from
their peculiar relation to the mouth I distinguish as the oral pinnules, very commonly '
