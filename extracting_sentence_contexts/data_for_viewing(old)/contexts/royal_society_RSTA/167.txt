discipline in its own right, because for most engineering applications the
shape of the body immersed in (or bounding) the fluid determines the flow
around (or inside) it, e.g. flow around an aircraft or inside a nuclear reactor.

n the large-scale environmental community, mesh generation research has
seen largely confined to different approaches to discretizing a spherical surface
and more recently to capturing shorelines. Owing to the comparatively low
vertical resolution of atmospheric models, discretization of the lower boundary
opography has not been a priority and is usually addressed by means
of curvilinear (terrain-following) methods. The ever increasing resolution of
general circulation models, and hence their ability to better capture significant
opography features, has brought the issue of mesh generation to the forefront
for a number of reasons, including the fact that poor mesh quality has a
detrimental effect on the quality of the flow (e.g. spurious wave generation due
