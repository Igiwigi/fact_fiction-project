£y by experiment, and @F/@z either by calculation or by experiment. Putting £ equal to £, in 15 and 16, and adding, we obtain

oe , pny One
F,+ F/ = Fy + Fu si (Gee"ys) az”
and substituting for &, from (20),
Fy + Fu == Beets — (Ep— bu + apes) ie ogee eeRes (21)

The differential coefficients of F can be calculated, but they can also be deter-
mined experimentally without difficulty. In fact, the measurements necessary to
determine &y also yield @F/@z?, and the measurements by which £p is determined
also yield @F/6z. In practice, with coils so nearly alike as those of the current balance, ~p is so
nearly equal to &, and F, so nearly equal to F,’, that the difference between
Fy + Fy’ and F, + FY is hardly detectable. The possibility of determining it
experimentally is nevertheless interesting.
