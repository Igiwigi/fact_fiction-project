Both above and below this marl are strata of gravel, and
some of the overlying beds contain round boulders a foot or more in diameter. This is the only place in Sweden where I met with any fossils in the midst of one
of the sand-oasar, or ridges of sand and gravel. The fact of finding the recent shells of
the Baltic in such a position appears to me of the highest interest, especially because
on the summit of this, as of other ridges, I found large erratic blocks resting imme-
diately on the uppermost layers of gravel or fine sand. In that part of the ridge
south of the town called Palacksbacken, these blocks are abundant, and are on the
very smnmit, appearing to be all superficial, for I could find none in situ in the deep
gravel-pits which intersect the ridge. I examined these blocks in company with Pro-
fessor WAHLENBERG, and found them to consist of angular masses of gneiss and gra-
nite, the larger ones rarely exceeding nine feet in length ; but we measured one
which was no less than sixteen feet long, thirteen high, and eight broad.
