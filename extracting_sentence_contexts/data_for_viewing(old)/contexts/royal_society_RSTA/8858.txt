latter will come out higher. In the second place, our calculations based on (2) require
the coefficient of darkening, in integrated light, to be %, whilst formula (7) requires
it to be 3. It thus demands still more darkening, and requires a still higher
temperature to compensate it.

If the solar temperature can really be deduced in this way, and if the ascertained
value has this high value, then we have an important contribution to solar physics.
But this procedure of LinpBLap’s violates the assumptions that were made at the
beginning of it. The temperature distribution is calculated on the basis of radiative
equilibrium, and the chief characteristic of radiative equilibrium is the existence of a
constant net flux of radiation of amount oT,‘ ; the magnitude of this flux determines
the temperature gradient and is itself determined by the amount of heat leaving the
surface—by the solar constant, in fact. But the value of T, determined by LiypBLap’s
method has no connection with this the original definition of T, ; it ignores the value
of the solar constant, demanding indeed nearly twice the accepted value. If it be
objected that although (7) was derived on radiative equilibrium it is really only used
as a working form of specification of the temperature distribution, then it and the
derived law of darkening sink to the level of an interpolation formula, and the quantities
are robbed of their physical significance ; further, it is in that case more logical to

assume a formula
Tt = hy + QT

and determine both constants to fit the observations. Again, it may be contended
that the observed radiation is considerably less than that leaving the photosphere, owing
