turned to the soil (fig. 36). In the only instance in which very young sporangia
were seen they occupied the tip of a process. Lastly, the occurrence of ramenta in
association with sporangia forming a bud-like structure must be noted. These cases,
of which several have been observed, are of interest since they constitute the nearest
approach to an apogamously produced vegetative bud found in the cultures of this
species. The ramenta have been found clothing the tip of a process on which
sporangia were developed (figs. 37, 38). In another case (fig. 39), they occurred on
the under side of a narrow, flat continuation of the prothallus immediately behind
the middle lobe which terminated in a sporangium.

The absence of any formation of vegetative organs of the sporophyte, except the
ramenta just described in the cultures of Nephrodiwm dilatatum is, when compared
with the not infrequent presence of sporangia, a striking fact, and one which must
be taken into account in attempting to estimate the importance to be attached to
the occurrence of the latter members.

Returning to the consideration of the structure of the different parts of the
prothalli, the general habit of which has now been described and illustrated, the
middle lobe may be first considered. Where typically developed, this is of triangular
outline ; its size varies. The example represented in fig. 40, the position of which
is seen in fig. 25, illustrates the essential features of its structure. The cells of
which it is composed are usually smaller than those of the rest of the prothallus.
Those near the middle line are often elongated. â€˜Their clear empty appearance
contrasts with the adjoining tissue of the prothallus. In the centre of the lobe
tracheides are developed, forming a more or less continuous strand. When, as is not
