Absence of turning in the second half-period is thus only
a degree less harmful than in the first. Considering how serious the results are known to be of omitting altogether the turning
of incubating eggs, it is, perhaps, surprising that more harm was not done to the
hatching in this case. The writer is inclined to explain it by the fact that the egg trays
were turned end for end each day; so that, though the eggs were not turned over in
the ordinary way, they did partake of a certain amount of gentle turning about a
vertical axis. ‘The remaining two tests, VIII, 3 and 4, show changes in percentage of 4 and 6; the
6 for and the 4 against theory a. VIII, 3, is thus the only one of the four tests that
is not in accord with that theory.—Added January, 1925.]

Test V. (Table IX.).—The egg tray of a 130-egg Gloucester was replaced by five
narrow trays, each tray capable of holding two rows of “ corresponding” eggs—
9 eggs in each—one row being turned five times and the other twice daily. The trays
stood at different levels so that their initial temperatures (each the mean of three values
obtained from three clinical thermometers among the eggs) varied from 104°-3 F.
