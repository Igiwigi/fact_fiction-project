The lobes of a comb are not
isolated, but form a continuous skeleton. In every case a higher magnification makes
it evident that these combs are not sharply divided from the material round them,
but fade softly into it. In fact, the margin of a comb does not mark an abrupt
change in the process of crystallisation. This important point became very evident
in a section etched electrolytically by being made the anode in a cell containing
dilute sulphuric acid. This method of etching revealed the margins of the real
skeleton crystals.
