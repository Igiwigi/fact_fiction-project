the surrounding protoplasm, of two distinet colours (see Plate 85, fig. 8).

The red hematoxylin stains the connective-tissne, and the protoplasm of the con-
nective-tissue-corpuscles and of the granular cells, and the walls of the vessels ; while
the blue deeply stains mucus, almosb all nuelei, the reticulum, and the lymphoid
corpuscles.*

As a rule, if only a single staining is used, the solutions which are of a purple colour
are much the best ; the red hzzmatoxylin solutions-do not stain deeply enough, though
specimens stained by them bear high powers well. The blue solutions leave the
protoplasm of the cells almost uncoloured ; and the dark colour of the nuclei, and of
the lymphoid cells, prevents the other Å¿eatures of the specimen from being well seen,
in fact s8uch specimens are very unsatisfactory.

The difference in colour of the hematoxylin 80lations depends almosb entirely on
the alum which is used in making them. Tt is true that the different woods give a
slightly different extract, but the variation between the extracts, whether they are
made from Campeachy or Jamaica, Honduras or St. Domingo woods, is s0 slight as
not to be of any real importance. The alum by keeping becomes more acid, and
acid, as is well known to chemists, turns the blue colour of hamatoxylin, red. The
most intensely blue colour is obtained by using freshly-prepared dried alum, while old
powdered crystals of alum (potash alum) give a most decided red or even a yellow
colour. The proportion of alum to the hamatoxylin extract is also 8omewhat important.
If the proportion sinks below three of alum to one of extract, the red colour will
probably be seen ; but, in that case, the staining properties will not be 80 good. Any
