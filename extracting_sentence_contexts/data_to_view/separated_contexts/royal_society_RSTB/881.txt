In some cases this increase only takes place z
a temporary diminution, but ultimately a much larger quantity is present than
first. Very soon an excretion of the enzyme takes place, the reserves of the sty
thenceforward being attacked and affording the tube the plastic material for
further growth. In many pollens the absorption of the sugar is followed by t
temporary increase of the starch in the tube, notably so in the case of Zamia, wh
contains none at starting.

POLLEN GRAIN AND THE NUTRITION OF THE POLLEN TUBE,

Re same time the style takes part in the nutritive processes, by itself trans-

g part of its starchy reserves.

h it would, perhaps, be at present premature to say that the process of
germination is altogether dependent on the presence of enzymes in the ripe
it is a very significant fact that as the grains lose their power of germination
increased age, this loss of power is attended by a very marked diminution in the
ity of diastase that can be extracted from them. Summary.

t
i results of the above-described experiments may be briefly summarized as
e

â€œiastase and invertase are both present in pollen grains, and can be extracted
1 hem by the same treatment as has been found effectual in the cases of seeds

Hliage leaves. The relative quantities differ a good deal; while some pollens
ay both, others possess only one, which may be either of the two, Various
emis may be used for extraction, 5 per cent. solution of NaCl being the most
efilly useful.
