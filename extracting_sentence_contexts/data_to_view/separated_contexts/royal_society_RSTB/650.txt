In all the other British Skate, with the exception of R. fullonica, R. circularis,
and R. radiata, the electric organ resembles that of 2. batis. In each case the electric
elements are in the form of dises, but only in two of them, R. alba and R. macro-
rhynchus, is there any evidence that the organ reaches a large size. The organ is, in
fact, so smal] in most of the members of the Skate genus that it is difficult to imagine
what useful purpose it can serve ; but as to its utility some light may be thrown when
we understand the use (granting there is any) of the large organ of full-grown
specimens of F. batis, say of specimens 7 feet in length, with an electrical apparatus
weighing about 300 grms. The more important stages through which the relatively large and complex electrical
elements of £. batis have passed during their evolution seem to have been, as it were,
stereotyped in the three British species of Skate in which the electric organ consists
of electric cups, 7.¢., in R. radiata, R. circularis, and R. fullonica. The small and apparently primitive species, 2. radiata, possesses the most primitive
form of electrical organ that can well be imagined ; instead of complex discs or greatly
specialised plates the organ of FR. radiata consists of structures which, though no
longer resembling muscular fibres in appearance, present the characteristic muscular
striation as well as the large protoplasmic plate, with its countless nerve fibres, so
characteristic of electric organs.
