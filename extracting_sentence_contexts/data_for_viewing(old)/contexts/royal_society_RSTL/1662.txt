poles.
The most simple hypothesis; which first presented itself to


322 Don J. Ropn16vez's Observations on the

their'imagination, was that which supposed the earth to be
throughout composed of the same kind of matter, and its sur-
face that of a spheroid generated by revolution round its axis,
This hypothesis, adopted by Newrox only as an approximation
to the truth, is, in fact, perfectly consistent with the equilibrium
to which particles in a state of paste, or of tardy fluidity, would
arrive in a short time after their present motion was impressed;
and the eccentricity derived from this hypothesis is at least
not very remote from that which actually obtains in the pre-
sent state of consistence and stability which the earth has since
acquired.

But the homogeneity of the matter, of which the earth con-
8ists, is at variance with all geological observations, which
prove evidently that at least 5ooo toises of the exterior crust
is formed of an immense mass of heterogeneous matters vary-
ing in density from each other ; and upon the supposition of
