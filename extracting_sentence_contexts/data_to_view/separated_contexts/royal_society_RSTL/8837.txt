On closing the circuit, the
needle 8wings at once up to, and then oscillates about its ultimate position of rest, and
stays there while the current is passing. On breaking the circuit, the needle at once
returns, oscillates on either side of, and then stops at zero. During these experiments we were frequently struck by the analogy of the two cases,
and impressed with the idea that cutting off the light was, in point of fact, removing
the electromotor of the current.
