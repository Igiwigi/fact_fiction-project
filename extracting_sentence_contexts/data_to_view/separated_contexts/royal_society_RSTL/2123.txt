Tux fact discovered by BoyLE and MakrtoTTE, that the
space occupied by air is in the inverse ratio of the pressure,
is one of great importance in the doctrine of elastic fluids. It may probably not be mathematically true in extreme
cases ; but in those where the condensations and rarefactions
do not exceed zo or 100 times, there is reason to believe the
above ratio is a very near approximation to the truth,

Sir Isaac NEwrTox has shown in the 23d prop. book ii. of
the Principia, that if homogeneous particles of matter were
endued with a power of repulsion in the inverse ratio of their
central distances, collectively they would form an elastic
fluid agreeing with atmospheric air in its mechanical proper-
ties. He does not infer from this demonstration that elastic
fluids must necessarily consist of such particles ; and his
argument requires that the repulsive power of each particle
terminate, or very nearly $0, in the adjacent particles.
