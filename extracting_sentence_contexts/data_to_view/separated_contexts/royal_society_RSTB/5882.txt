248 H. HAMSHAW THOMAS ON SOME PTERIDOSPERMOUS PLANTS

Leaves of the Lepidopteris type are present in the bed at the Waterfall, but they need
not be considered when discussing the Corystospermacew, since their characteristic
stomatal structure has enabled their seed-bearing structures to be identified with some
certainty. Thus the facts of association are strongly in favour of the hypothesis that
Umkomasia, Pilophorosperma, Spermatocodon, and probably Pteruchus belonged to the
plants which bore leaves of the Dicroidium and ‘* Stenopteris ” type.
