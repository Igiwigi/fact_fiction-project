siderably nearer the glass than their focus; for the eye ought
on no account to come into contact with the eye piece ; and
a little practice will soori enable the observer to keep his eye
in the required situation. It is hardly necessary to add, that
no hand should touch the eye piece.

With regard to the eye glasses, when merely the object
of saving light is considered, I can say from experience, that
concaves have greatly the advantage of convexes; and that
they give also a much more distinct image than convex
glasses.

This fact I established by repeated experiments about the
year 1776, with a set of concave eye glasses I had prepared
for the purpose, and which are till in my possession. The
glasses, both double and plano-concaves, were alternately
tried with convex lenses of an equal focus, and the result, for
brightness and distinctness, was decidedly in favour of the
concaves.

For the cause of the superior brightness and sharpness of
the image which is given by these glasses, we must probably
look to the circumstance of their not permitting the reflected
rays to come to a focus.
