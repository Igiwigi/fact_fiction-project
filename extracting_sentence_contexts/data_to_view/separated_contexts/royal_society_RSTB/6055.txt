thinness of the wall, or to a lack of parallel arrangement of the particles of cellulose
composing it. â€˜The former view is held by Frey, and seems to be the most probable. The fact that primary walls do not give double refractive effects does not prohibit
a space-latticed structure, and the following considerations lead us to suspect that
these walls have, in fact, just such a structure as the thicker, double refractive ones
later deposited on them. * In the laying down of new wall layers two factors are obviously concerned :

(1) The structure of the old wall upon which the new layer is deposited.
