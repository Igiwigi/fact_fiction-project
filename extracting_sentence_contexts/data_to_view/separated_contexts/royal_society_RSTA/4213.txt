While these terminological distinctions may
be somewhat tenuous, they do not affect Chiribella, D’Ariano and Perinotti’s main argument. The purification principle is a new principle. Beyond the fact that it has a richer content than
does Schrédinger’s statement, Schrédinger never saw his claim as a principle, perhaps because of
his critical view of QM. The principle could be related to Bohr’s complementarity, which implies
and even states that ‘ignorance about a part [one of the two complementary parts] is always
compatible with the maximal knowledge of the whole’, making the very language of ‘parts’ and
‘whole’ provisional. Chiribella, D’Ariano and Perinotti’s formulation of the purification principle
to the effect that ‘every physical state can be viewed as the marginal of some pure state of a
compound system’ avoids this difficulty.
