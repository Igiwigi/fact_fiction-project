We have no idea how closely associated and intermingled
these two constituents are in ordinary (single) nuclei, or what the effect of their
interaction may be. If the sequence of the loss of syngamy and the development of a binucleate
condition has been different in the two cases of the uniflagellate binucleates
(Leptomonas—Trypanosoma) and the biflagellate (heteromastigine) forms (Bodo—
Trypanoplasma), there is one interesting point which may be thereby accounted for. This is the fact that the organella termed kinetonucleus does not appear to be of
quite the same type in these two different lines of forms. As has been clearly shown
by Wenyon for Herpetomonas musce-domestice and Leishmania, the kinetonucleus in
the uniflagellate forms is of definite nuclear structure and in its division the basal
granule of the flagellum acts unmistakably as a centrosome. On the other hand,
the kinetonucleus of a trypanoplasm is a large, unwieldy and apparently more inert
organella ; indeed in some intestinal forms it is usually found in two or three pieces.
