indices dx“ is just a ‘Kronecker delta’ translating the abstract index on ‘p,’ to conventional 1-
form notation). When PV = PN, so our symplectic 6-manifold is the canonically given pN(=pV),
we can apply twistor notation, finding

® =iZ"dZy =-iZ,dZ", EY =db =idZ% A dZy.

Equality of the two expressions for follows from the nullity of Z%, since 0 = d(Z%Zq) = Z¢dZ +
ZqAZ.

At this point, the idea is to appeal to the procedures of geometric quantization [9], according
to which a bundle connection is provided, the bundle being a circle bundle over the symplectic
manifold (here p\/) under consideration, the curvature of this connection being the given
2-form ®. In the present situation, we are fortunate in the fact that the appropriate circle bundle,
namely N, is already to hand, the circle being the phase freedom in 14, where the momentum null
(co-)vector pa, taken to scale the rays, is spinorially split:

Pa=ara’; with phase freedom zy +> een (0 real).

The 2-spinor zy’ is also taken parallel-propagated along each ray y—providing a -scaled
ray [’—the phase freedom applying to each ray as a whole. This defines our required bundle
7-space NV. In fact (up to a twofold sign ambiguity) the phase is geometrically realized as a null
2-plane (‘flag plane’ [1]) through the null-vector direction determined by p". In the flat-space case,
this phase freedom is simply the Z+> e!@Z noted in §1, our circle bundle WV over pN being N.

The geometric (pre-)quantization connection [9] is defined by the 1-form # (= ~iZ~dZ*, in the
