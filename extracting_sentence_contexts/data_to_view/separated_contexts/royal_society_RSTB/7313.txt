In order to do this
more readily, the Lucilia growth curve has been superimposed upon that for C. marginalis in
figure 44. Lucilia is half-way through its most rapid growth period by the time that C. marginalis
enters this phase. In fact, by this time, Lucilia has completed nearly three-quarters of its
total growth and has a very excellent chance of finishing it before a shortage of food occurs. Furthermore, Lucilia can, at this juncture, form viable pupae, larvae which have attained
this weight having given rise to healthy adults in experiments. The relative weights of the
larvae of the two species at this point are significant.
