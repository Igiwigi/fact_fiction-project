what would be the appearance of several such juxtaposed currents, if
een in a transverse section ; but it should be borne in mind that we cannot look for a
strict analogy in the breadth, average thickness, and degree of compactness in lavas of
ancient and modern cones, unless we are able to compare sections of such cones at
corresponding heights, which is usnally impossible,

Fleaures and arches in ancient lavas. In order to guard against imagining a contrast between older and newer lavas, where
none really exists, we must remember that the steeper the angle at which a current
has cooled, the more parallel in general will be the planes of stratification of the several
scoriaceous and stony layers which compose it. No doubt a great diversity of cha-
racter prevails in this respect in lavas which have congealed on corresponding decli-
vities, but I never met with ridges and furrows of great dimensions where the original
slope exceeded an angle of 20*; and the rare occurrence of flexures on a gigantic scale
in the steeply inclined layas of the Val del Bove, has always appeared to me a fact in
favour of the original steep dip of those lavas. We have already seen (p. 718, fig. 6, and
