hat the presence of solvent interfaces (capillary bridges, free surfaces) can create
forces that entirely suppress Brownian motion even within the colloidal domain,
as can the non-equilibrium phenomenon of glass formation.

In planning the meeting, the organizers were mindful of the fact that high-
precision experimental work, often involving direct particle imaging, has shed
new mechanistic light on both sides of the granular/colloid divide, highlighting
similarities as well as differences between granular and colloidal dynamics.
An instance is in the formation of separate regions of static and flowing material
under homogeneous stress conditions to create ‘shear bands’. In dry granular
flows, these are usually microscopic (a few grains across) whereas for colloidal
systems they are often macroscopic (occupying a substantial fraction of the width
of the sample cell). This difference is not understood; yet shear banding (as well
as jamming, see below) underlies the physics of thixotropy—a theme explored
in the contribution of Bonn and colleagues in this volume (Moller et al. 2009).
Shear banding also poses important challenges to the modelling of dense granular
flows, exemplified here by the contribution of Pouliquen & Forterre (2009) on the
