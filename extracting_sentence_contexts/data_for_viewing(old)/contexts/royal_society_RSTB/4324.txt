* Presumably, in employing this name, KAsTsCHENKO intended to emphasise the superficial origin of
this part of the thymus, since, unlike the corresponding glands in Trichosurus and Talpa, it does not
retain a superficial position in the full-grown animal.

question as to the ectodermal derivation of by far the larger portion of the primordium,
That being so, we would lay special emphasis on the fact that the cervical gland, so
far as we have been able to observe, differs in no essential histological respect from
the thoracic glands which are unquestionably of purely entodermal origin so far as
their epithelial basis is concerned. In both glands, cortical and medullary regions of
apparently identical constitution are recognisable, in both Hassall’s corpuscles are
developed, and in connection with both accessory epithelial bodies may be present.*
It would appear then that we have here a remarkable case of parallelism in
histological differentiation between two glands, one with an epithelial basis largely
ectodermal in origin, the other with a purely entodermal basis, and the question arises
what significance are we to attach to this phenomenon? In this connection the
bearing of the facts above set forth on the much discussed question of the origin of
the “lymphoid” cells of the thymus (referred to elsewhere in this paper as
lymphocytes), which, after all, form the characteristic and essential elements of the
