If we assume that the
monopole density is small, then, following the theory of weak electrolytes, we
would expect the cross terms Lj with ij to be zero. However, the monopole
motion should be strongly correlated in the sense that it always acts to maintain
local charge neutrality:

Quis + Q5-=0 (4.2)
and

Qec4 + Qc =0. (4.3)

It is important to emphasize that this thermodynamic force is not the same
as Ryzhkin’s reaction field m which is a purely spin phenomenon peculiar
to spin ice. In fact, equation (2.3) does not account for Coulombic correlation

4In the temperature range considered here (e.g. 0.4-10.0K for Dy2TigO7), at zero applied field,
the Debye length is the dominant length scale in the system, and, as shown below, magnetic
inhomogeneities develop on this length scale. In the lower temperature range, not considered
here, inhomogeneities on the scale of the Bjerrum length ty =o Q?/8mkT become particularly
important, and probably dominate (see [11,12,42]). Phil.
