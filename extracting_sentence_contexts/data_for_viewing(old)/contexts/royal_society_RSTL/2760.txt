'THE rexearches of PrmesTLEY, INcENHOUsZ, SENEBIER, ELLIS, and above all of the
younger SAUsSURE, have long put us in possession of the leading facts appertaining
to the influence of light upon the green parts of plants; and Professor DzcanDoLLE
has embodied the substance of all that had been ascertained on this subject, up to the
year 1831, in his admirable work on Vegetable Physiology. But there appear, by
the confession of this latter naturalist, to remain certain subordinate questions re-
specting this same function, which, though perhaps occasionally touched upon by
the above-cited experimentalists and by others, can scarcely be said to have as yet
obtained a satisfactory reply.

The first of these questions relates to the nature of the influence which, in the
cases alluded to, is assignable to light. As this agent often produces chemical
changes by its direct action upon inorganic bodies, decomposing saline solutions,
discolouring oils, and reducing metallic oxides, s0 it may be supposed to operate
