When the population of wolves had been
reduced by approximately 50%, the deer multiplied rapidly for about 10 years and reached
a population level which was three times as high as before. In South Africa, it is undeniable that the blowfly position has steadily deteriorated
during the last 20 or 30 years. This period roughly coincides with the rapid extension of
sheep rearing over large tracts of country, but this fact does not provide the full explanation
of blowfly increase. In the past, birds of prey and carnivorous animals formed a normal
part of the wild fauna. Unfortunately, these predatory animals do not confine their atten-
tions to the indigenous fauna but will also attack domesticated animals of a suitable size,
such as fowls and lambs.
