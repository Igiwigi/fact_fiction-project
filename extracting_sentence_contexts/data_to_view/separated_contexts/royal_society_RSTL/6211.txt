Jags S1MPs0N, formerly student of Natural Philosophy in my class, has furnished
me with thirty-three observations taken in good sunlight. Ten of these were between
the two standard colours, and give the following result ;—

88:7(88)-E38'1(68)=W. . 7. =. (1)
The mean errors of these observations were as follows :—

Error of (88)=25; of (68)=2:3; of (88)+(68)=4:8; of (88)—(68)=1-3. The fact that the mean error of the -sum was 80 much greater than the mean error of
the difference, indicates that in this case, as in all others that I have examined, observa-
tions of equality of tint can be depended on much more than observations of equality of
illumination or brightness. k

From six obseryations of my own, made at the same time, I have deduced the
+ trichromic ” equation
22:6(104)+26(88)+37:4(68)=W.. . - « « +» - (2)
If we suppose that the light which reached the organ of vision was the same in both
cases, We may combine these equations by subtraction, and s0 find
22-6(104)—7-7(88)+4-3(68)=D, . . . . . . - (8.)

where D is that colour, the absence of the sensation of which constitutes the defect of
the dichromic eye. The sensation which I have in addition to those of the dichromic
eye is therefore similar to the full red (104), but different from it, in that the red (104)
has 7-7 of green (88) in it which must be removed, and 4-3 of blue (68) substituted. This agrees pretty well with the colour which Mr.
