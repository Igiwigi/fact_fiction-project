The resulting network maximal : s
modularity can be evaluated as a function of the parameter Â¢, thus tuning the weights in D, (41, d2) 1 oe

to the best structural result. Such a tuning is not an artefact, as the resulting classification shows. In fact, it is possible to observe a good classification of the different communities of ZKCN. Remarkably, for the case of C. elegans, the method precisely separates all the metabolic pathways
and intrapathway functions. Consequently, such a detailed function identification represents an
improvement with respect to the GO classification available at KEGG.
