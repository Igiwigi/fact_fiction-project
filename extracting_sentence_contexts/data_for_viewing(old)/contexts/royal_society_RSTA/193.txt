are particularly interesting in the context of binary systems: they can be created,
altered and destroyed by interactions with their many nearby neighbours. Naively,
one would expect that the gravitational interactions of stars in clusters will
ultimately lead to a core collapse to an infinite mass in a finite time. Indeed, post-
core-collapse (PCC) clusters do exist, but their cores have not collapsed in such
a dramatic manner. Something must therefore eventually stop this process, most
probably the formation of binaries in the cluster cores during the late collapse
stages. In fact, the formation of a few hard binaries could entirely halt this core
collapse, even in the most massive clusters.

X-ray observations, in particular, have provided circumstantial evidence for
significant binary populations in star clusters. A much higher fraction of X-ray-
bright sources in our Milky Way is associated with globular clusters than would be
expected from the field stellar population. These are believed to be short-period
binaries in which mass is transferred from a main-sequence onto a neutron star
(cf. Phinney & Kulkarni 1994). These low-mass X-ray binaries form preferentially
in globular clusters, perhaps as the result of core collapse. However, many PCC
clusters do not contain X-ray binaries, so other types of binaries must exist there
o halt their collapse.
