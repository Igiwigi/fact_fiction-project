But we were surprised to find that on refractionating, the
Edensity of the gas, instead of rising, fell. This we found subsequently due to the
Braet that the gas was pumped out of the fractionating bulb without removing the
jacket of liquid air; and under these circumstances, the xenon, of which the density
Sis 64, remained in the bulb. On one occasion, the jacket was removed; and the
Bamall remaining quantity was collected separately ; it turned out to possess a ABO:
iru totally differing from that of krypton, and was subsequently named ‘“ xenon.’
The spectrum of krypton is one which is remarkable for its brilliancy, and for the
fact that a small amount of gas, present along with argon, is easily recognised by the
Sspectroscope ; and this led us to believe that krypton possessed a density not
-adiffering greatly from that of argon. Repeated fractionation, moreover, did not
Zappear to produce any marked change in its character or brilliancy.
= It would be tedious to relate in detail all the unsuccessful experiments which were
ae before the truth was discovered, that krypton isa gas present in very small
E quantity, but possessing a density of 40°8. Suffice it to state that the gas was
gfractionated more than twelve times, and that 24 determinations of density were
made, We will, therefore, at once proceed to describe the method by which krypton
Band xenon were prepared in a pure state.
§ The gas remaining after the evaporation of the air used in various experiments,
which we estimate as having been not less than 30 litres in all, was purified in the
A manner already deseribed from oxygen and nitrogen.
