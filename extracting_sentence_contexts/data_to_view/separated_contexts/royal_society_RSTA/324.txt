Alternatively, the fictitious
points could be expressed in terms of w,, Wz, We and wp, leaving four equations for relaxation. OF ELLIPTIC DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 367

Or again, an iterative process could be used, in which the fictitious points are held fixed at
some approximate values while equations (B.16) are solved for wy, W;, We and wp. New
and more accurate values can then be obtained for the fictitious points from (B.17) and
the process repeated until there is no further change. This last method is effectively the one
used (graphically) by Fox & Southwell, and has the advantage that no complicated formulae
are used in the relaxation; the process may, however, converge only slowly. The solution of these equations agrees with the analytical solution (B. 14) to four figures,
the precision being dependent on the number of decimals retained in the binomial coeffi-
cients and subsequent work.
