We let
p be the unique weak solution in L®([0, T]; LR, (R%)) of the transport equation (1.1) with advecting
field v and initial data p (note that v has compact support). By a scaling computation (as in §3.2 of [9]) and using remark 2.3 we see that

But, thanks to the bound (2.5) provided by proposition 2.2, for every n € N, we have

Mn = |IVAI12(Q,)-


Therefore, using the fact that we will select the cubes Qn to be disjoint, it follows that

We conclude that our task is to determine the location of the disjoint cubes Q,, and choose the
sequences {A,,} and {t,} in such a way that

where we denote by Q,(x) the cube of side-length r > 0 centred at x € 4, and we set [8

By the Lebesgue differentiation theorem, we have |R4 \ D|=0.
