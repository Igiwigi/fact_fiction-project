How are we to explain this high acuity for lights of all colours? This is difficult enough
on the triple-receptor plan, but almost impossible on the poly-receptor plan of Granit. Clearly, the hypothesis which most easily fits in with the observed facts is the single-
receptor plan. For, according to this, no matter what the colour of the light may be, every
receptor is capable of responding. Nevertheless, there are grave difficulties in the way of
the acceptance of this plan, into which it is not proposed to enter in detail here; but it is,
for example, contrary to the results of Granitâ€™s experiments.
