us take n = 10" as a probable maximum for the number of corpuscles in a cubic
centimetre of, say, carbon; then, at 2730째 absolute {nw = 3 x 10째, so that the
saturation current would be 18 x 10'% electrostatic units or 6 x 10째 amperes per square
centimetre. As the largest current which has been yet obtained is 2째0 amperes per
square centimetre, it is evident that we are still a long way from the limit. This
calculation seems to indicate that the region on the current temperature diagram
when the current begins to be proportional to the square root of the absolute
temperature is much higher than any temperature which can be reached in the
ordinary way.

The magnitude of the currents which have been obtained with low voltages
indicate that a vacuum bounded by a hot conductor is, at any rate under certain
circumstances, an extremely good conductor of electricity. In fact, it seems probable
that such a vacuum is capable of becoming the best conductor that can possibly be
obtained. The conductivity of metals is limited by the shortness of the mean free
path of the ions, whereas the mean free path of a corpuscle in an atmosphere of
corpuscles is probably very large. All that is necessary, therefore, to produce a big
current is to supply the ions quickly enough at the hot surface, that is, to raise the

temperature of the hot conductor to a sufficient extent. The experiments also seem
to show that as far as electrical conductivity is concerned, the boundary of a hot
conductor is an indefinite term; since so many of the corpuscles pass freely to the
