pathways on this material. Specifically, weak van der Waals interactions are key to the
selectivity of Au materials, including npAu. We also briefly describe other systems in which
this integrated approach was applied.

]. Introduction

For global energy security, there is an absolute imperative for a transformational approach to
downsizing the energy footprint of the chemical industry. Chemical industries are the second
largest users of energy in the manufacturing sector and the largest for delivered energy (19% of
total global energy use in 2010) [1]. Current worldwide energy demand and consumption will

increase from 524 quadrillion Btu in 2010 to 820 quadrillion Btu in 2040, an increase of 56%. :2
This fact alone supports the need for new, innovative, sustainable catalytic conversion processes : =
to offset this global consumption within the industrial market. Given that the industrial sector, : Ss
including the manufacturing of bulk chemicals, uses more delivered energy than any other end- : =
use sector, the need for new and sustainable catalytic processes is all the more urgent. In the USA, DR
the industrial sector is responsible for nearly a third of total energy use, where consumption is in : 3
energy-intensive processing. Breakthroughs are required so that bulk manufacturing of chemicals 3
is performed at lower temperatures and catalytic conversion reactions are more selective and :8
energy efficient. : s

Future energy needs call for dramatic increases in the sustainability of chemical production. 73

Meeting this challenge requires deep insight into how to control reaction selectivity for networks
of complex transformations. It also relies on innovative design of new types of catalytic
