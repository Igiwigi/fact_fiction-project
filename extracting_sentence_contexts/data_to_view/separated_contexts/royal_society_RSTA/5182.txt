On the other hand, the 785nm laser showed better S/N ratio for the
detection of sulfate/carbonate mineral matrix in the cases when the fluorescence background
was at reasonable level (figure 2). A strong fluorescence background was registered when employing the 785nm laser for
analysis of pigmented crusts from the Mojave salt lakes. In fact, this is considered to be the
main reason for no carotenoid Raman bands being detected within these samples using this
laser wavelength. The spectra achieved by the spectrometer equipped with the 532 nm excitation
source also have fluorescence background (see the comparison of the raw and baseline-corrected
spectra for the both laser lines in figure 3). Nevertheless, its intensity is lower compared with
that observed at 785 nm, which together with the attendant resonance Raman enhancement of the
carotenoid Raman signal allowed the detection of carotenoids to be accomplished successfully
in the majority of the samples.
