fallen (from 37) to that of the air, It was found now to be even greater than in
Experiment 1. It thus became clear that the relatively great value of the latter was
not due to a time effect lasting over three months (as was at first thought possible),
but to the fact that the material had been allowed to cool uninterruptedly from a
temperature of about 550° C. (see Experiment 7). If the permeability had been
measured immediately after this cooling it would apparently have been found to be as
high as it was three months later. An attempt was now made to find how the permeability of the ring in its new state
altered with rising temperature.
