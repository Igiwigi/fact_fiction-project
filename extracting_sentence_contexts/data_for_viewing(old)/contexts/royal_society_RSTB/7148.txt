THE DYNAMICS OF THE HALTERE

The haltere may be considered, from a mechanical point of view, as a system as shown
in figure 6. This diagram includes all the articulations of the organ in a way which makes
it easier to understand their action. The main horizontal articulation is represented by
the bearings AA; the secondary freedom of movement given by the depressed fold and the
condylic peg by a rotation about the pin P, whose axis lies at right angles to the paper. This

movement is damped by the fluid contents of the basal swelling, the damping being repre-
sented by the dash-pot H. Owing to the fact that the centre of gravity C of the end-knob
lies to the rear of the axis of the haltere stalk, the line joining this to the articulation point P
makes an angle of less than 90Â° with the main hinge AA when the haltere is at rest. The
elasticity of the main hinge is represented by the spring S, whose ends are inserted respec-
tively in the axle and the bearing, and the arm M represents the attachment of the haltere
muscle, whose pull must be taken as coming in a direction at right angles to the plane of
the paper.

The first point to note about such a system, which can be rotated about AA in one direc-
tion only by the pull of the muscle, being restored by an elastic force, is that the frequency
of oscillation must be very nearly the natural period of the system. Successive contractions
of the muscle must occur at a frequency related accurately to the mechanical resonance
