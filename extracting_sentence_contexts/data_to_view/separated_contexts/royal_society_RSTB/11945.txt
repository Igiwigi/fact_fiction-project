Main assumptions and comparison between the full and simplified models.

model assumption full model ( simplified model (§3)
extracellular glutamate flow and diffusion yes yes
ammonium flow and diffusion yes No (no ammonium present)
extracellular potassium flow and diffusion yes yes
decay of flow and diffusion rates towards the biofilm interior as a yes yes
consequence of cellular density
glutamate uptake favoured by hyperpolarization and disfavoured by yes yes
depolarization
glutamate uptake enhanced in metabolically active cells through the effect of biomass- directly linked to intracellular
producing biomolecules glutamate
saturable glutamate uptake yes yes
GDH dynamics regulated by glutamate yes no (no GDH present)
ammonium produced from intracellular glutamate by GDH yes No (no ammonium present)
growth favoured by high levels of intracellular glutamate through intermediate biomass- directly modulated by
producing biomolecules. intracellular glutamate
metabolic stress inhibited by intracellular glutamate yes yes
potassium channel opening probability (n,) increased by stress yes yes
potassium released as a result of the opening probability (n,) and yes yes
membrane potential
potassium uptake governed by homeostatic processes and the metabolic yes yes
state of the cells (intracellular glutamate)
membrane potential determined by intracellular and extracellular yes yes
potassium concentrations
ThT as a reporter of membrane potential yes yes
neighbouring lattice sites. In addition, we also account for the part in the various biochemical reactions. We model explicitly

‘Biofilm’ sites correspond to small biofilm regions, such ammonium by the action of the enzyme GDH. In turn, we
that variable values would correspond to averages across mul- model GDH synthesis in its inactive form (h) and subsequent
