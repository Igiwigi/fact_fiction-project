GltPh has an occluded substrate binding site. (2) Electron density for substrate situated in a pocket underneath
hairpin 2 (HP2; red), above HP1 (yellow), and adjacent to TM7 (orange) and TM8 (purple) (Yernool ez al. 2004).
(6) Close-up of substrate electron density (blue mesh) and sulphur anomalous density associated with bound cysteine
sulfinic acid (green mesh) and interacting residues on HP1, HP2, TM7 and TMB8. Colouring is the same as in (a)
(Boudker et al. 2007).

might also act as a competitive inhibitor of GltPh. On the aspartate-
basis of 7H-Asp uptake experiments using purified GltPh

reconstituted into proteoliposomes, we showed that

TBOA does in fact inhibit transport (Boudker et al.

2007). These results then prompted us to determine the

structural basis for TBOA inhibition. We solved the structure of TBOA bound to GltPh
and found that in the complex with TBOA, HP2 L-aspartate
adopts an open conformation, with residues at the tip
displaced as much as 10 A from the closed, occluded
state conformation (Boudker et al. 2007; figure 7).
