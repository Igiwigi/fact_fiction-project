The explanation of my case comprebends and accounts for, with trifling
exceptions, the whole varied range of symptoms described by others; and I think there
are fair grounds for believing that the few discrepancies that exist are but apparent,
and admit of being satisfactorily explained away, on the grounds above alluded to. It
appears to me, therefore, a reasonable inference, that the great majority of cases of
colour-blindness hitherto described, correspond in general nature with my own.

26. And I think there must be great difficulty in finding any hypothesis, except that
of perfect dichromic vision, which will satisfactorily account for the facts observed. Take for instance the most common symptom, the confounding of red and green. If it
be assumed that either of the colours presents its proper sensation to the colour-blind, it
is difficult to avoid the inference that this colour ought always to be recognized ; but
this is not 80, red and green being generally both mistaken.
