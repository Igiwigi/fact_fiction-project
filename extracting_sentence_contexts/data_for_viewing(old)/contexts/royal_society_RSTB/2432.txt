divisions, Filices Gyrate, and Filices Agyratze, according to the presence or absence
of an annulus. The character thus introduced was used in various ways by subse-
quent writers, the position and form of the annulus being noted, as well as the mode
of dehiscence. It is not necessary here to follow through the detailed history of the
matter, as this has been efficiently done by BommEr* ; it suffices to say that the use
of the annulus culminated in the classification of Prest.t His Ordo. I. Filices, which
excluded Hymenophyllacese, Parkeriacese, Schizeeacere, Osmundacee, Marattiacez,
Ophioglossacese, was divided into two sub-orders, Helicogyrate, BERNH., and Catheto-
gyrate, BERN. ; according as the annulus was oblique or vertical. This character has
been used with greater or less prominence by all subsequent writers on the subject,
but exceptions were found by G. Kunze,{ in the case of certain Japanese Ferns referred
to the genus Lomaria. These sporangia showed an oblique annulus, with lateral
dehiscence, and a short massive stalk; in fact, characters which resemble those of
the Cyatheacew ; he styles them “sporangia Plagiogyrata” (see above, figs. 139-143).
The question was thus raised of how such Ferns are to be classified. Kunze did not
hold the oblique annulus to be a sufficient reason for removing them from the genus
Lomaria, with which their affinity had been recognised on grounds of habit, but
founded for them the section Plagiogyria, which was adopted by Sir Wm. Hooxer,
and remains in the ‘Synopsis Filicum.’ Merrentus,§ on the other hand, concluded
that, recognising the oblique direction of the complete ring as the character of the
Cyatheacee,-and the vertical direction of the incomplete ring as that of the Poly-
podiaceze, with the same right as Alsophila is separated from Phegopteris, Hemitelia
from Cystopteris, Cyathea from Woodsia, Cibotium from Dicksonia, so ought
Plagiogyria to be ranked with the Cyatheacez.
