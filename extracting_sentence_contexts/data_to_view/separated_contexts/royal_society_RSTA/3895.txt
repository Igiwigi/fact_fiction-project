In addition, cell membranes are stuffed with lipids and proteins, some of
which have large appendages or are tethered to skeletal proteins. From the biological point of view, the consequences of crowding is still an open question. In
fact, crowding exerts important effects on the transport of macromolecules and their aggregation,
binding, reactivity and stability, cell metabolism, signalling and motility [5,6]. Given the wide
diversity of cellular environments, it is quite arduous to determine a few working principles in
the compartment organization. Crowding hinders solute diffusion, so that compartmentalized
metabolism requires diffusive barriers to be overcome.
