of a frequency v where, if 4 is PLANcK’s constant, hy is the difference of energy between
two states—when the electron passes from one state to the other. In the case of
elliptic motion, SommerFetD finds it necessary for certain purposes to confine the
eccentricities of the possible ellipses to definite discrete values, and thus obtains
spectral lines which are not single, as in Bour’s theory in its ordinary form, but which
have a definite structure. In fact, his theory involves the supposition that the Balmer
series is effectively a supposition of Diffuse, Sharp and Principal series, as in some of
the suggestions mentioned in the last section. These series are superposed in the
case of Hydrogen, on account of the simplicity of the atom, and general considerations
indicate—though not with great precision—that they would be widely separated in
the case of other elements. This is not the appropriate place for any discussion or
exposition of the theory, for we are concerned solely with the actual structure to
which it leads.
