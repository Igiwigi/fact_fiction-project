$ The following simple result belonging to the same order of ideas is also used in Part I:

% (8.8) Suppose Â® has only one maximal ideal P. Ifa subset YW of the quotient field of R
generates a principal ideal, (Ql) = 6, then a generating element for (WY) can be selected

Strom A.
2 In fact, At bP provided b+ 0; and any element of bR not in df is an associate of b.
