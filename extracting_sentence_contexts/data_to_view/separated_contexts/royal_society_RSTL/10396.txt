There was also in this case a phenomenon not obseryed in any other cage, viz. â€”
ptosis of the right eyelid. There was no local injury perceptible to account for this,
but whether it was the direct result of the prefrontal lesions is a point that may be
questionable. The facts of this experiment taken with those of Experiments 19 and
20 render it probable that the prefrontal lobes have essentially the same physiological
relations as the electrically effective postfrontal centres. 1

In Experiments 19 and 20, notwithstanding the extensive destruction of the post-
frontal centres, the paralysis of the lateral movements of the head and eyes was very
transitory, and in Experiment 23 the destruction of the prefrontal regions subsequent
to the recovery from the lesions of the post-frontal centres re-induced similar
symptoms. Hence it would appear that so long as portions of the frontal centres
remain intact, the movements of the head and eyes are not permanently paralysed. The prefrontal and postfrontal regions are shown by the secondary degenerative
changes demonstrated in Experiments 22 and 23, to be anatomically related to the
same tracts of the internal capsule and- crus cerebri. 'This fact also would indicate
community in their physiological relationships.
