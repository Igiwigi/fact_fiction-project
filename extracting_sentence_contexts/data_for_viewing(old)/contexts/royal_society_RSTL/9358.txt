panying woodeut (fig. 1); that is, they had the shape of an ordinary PLUokeR
tube, to one end of which a tube of hard glass (4) was fused. On the other
8ide it ended in a tube (b), which was fused to the air pump. The hard-
glass tube was filled with some substance which gave off oxygen on heating.
Permanganate of potash, chlorate of potash, and oxide of mercury were used,
80 as to eliminate any lines which might be due to the snbstance from which
the oxygen was prepared. Tt is necessary to snbject all these substances to
a preliminary heating, in order to free them beforehand, as much as possible,
from moisture, which always is attached to them. IT find permanganate of
potash to be the most convenient substance, and IT have only used the others
in tesb experiments. I have used capillary tubes of different bores, and I
think that some of the contradictory statements made by different observers
are simply due to the fact that the term * capillary tube” is rather vague, and com-
prises tubes of diameters sufficiently different to affect the spectrum. The dimensions
of two kinds of tubes chiefly used are as follows :—

Fs. 1.

A B
Distance between the poles . . . . . 14 8
Length of capillary tube . . . . . . 4 3:5
Diameter of capillary tube . . . . . 007 0:14

The measures are given in centimetres. Tubes with the dimensions given under the
heading A were generally employed. T have sometimes suppressed the capillary tube
