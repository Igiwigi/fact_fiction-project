As has
already been repeatedly mentioned, it is reticulated, the meshes showing elongation
to a considerable length in some sections, whilst in others theyâ€™are nearly round. These differences are probably wholly due to the plane in which it happens to be cut ;
when the section is on a plane pretty truly at right angles to the dentine surface, the
meshes are very greatly elongated, and when it approaches to parallelism with the
dentine they are round or hexagonal. In fact, the appearances are not very different
from those which would result from the apposition of a number of thin-walled tubes
running perpendicularly through it with delicate walls, and, perhaps, some inter-
stitial substance, a sort of honeycomb with enormously elongated cells ; as, however,
they do not pursue an absolutely straight course, the whole length of any particular
mesh never lies within a single section. It takes even plasm stains only feebly,
hemalum staining it better than most other stains, but its outermost portion always
stains much more deeply than the rest, and rounded forms are there seen which at
first I was inclined to regard as nuclei, the nuclei of the transformed ameloblast cells,
But in sections which lie at right angles to the long axis of the tooth germ, and
therefore cut this region into slices nearly parallel with its own surface, it is found
that though the stained areas are circular, their outer borders are indefinite, and that
they surround sharply-defined circular areas which are less deeply, or not at all,
stained; this seems to negative the idea of the stained spots seen in longitudinal
