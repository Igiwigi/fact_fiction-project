The eyes of the Crocodilia act freely to drugs, the pupil expanding from a vertical oat-
shaped slit to a lozenge or round-oval shape, or even to a complete circle. In none of the snakes does atropine or eserine have the slightest effect on the pupil. This is certainly due to the fact that the eye is shut off by the false cornea and its
attachments to the surrounding epidermis at the sclero-corneal junction. In some
snakes light has a marked effect, but again in others no effect is perceptible. Thus, in
Naia, when the light of a lamp is focussed by means of a lens on the eye, the pupil
contracts from about 2 mm. or 3mm, to 0-75 mm. and instantly dilates to its former size
the moment the light is removed.
