which expresses that the ets (, 3, y, 3) and («', 8, y, 2') are homographic; for although
the homographic equation may be considered as belonging to the theory of the bipartite
quadric (x—&y) (x—=e'y), yet the theory of involution cannot be completely discussed
except in connexion with that of homography. If we write
A=(Þ—y)(«—d), B=(y—«)(BÞ—3), C=(a=BNy —d),
A'=(B—y)(s—d), B=(/—)(8'—?), C=(s—BN7—3),
then we have
A+B+C=0,
A'+B'+C'=0,
and thence
BC'—B'C=CA'—C'A=AB'—A'B;
and either of these expressions is in fact equal to the last-mentioned determinant, as
may be easily verified. Tence, when the determinant vanishes, we have
A:B:C=A':B: C.
Any one of the three ratios A: B: C, for instance the ratio B: C=
(y—a)(8—d)

(&—B) (y—8)"
is said to be the anharmonic ratio of the set (, 8, y, 3), and consequently the two sets
(«, B, y,8) and (&', B', y\, 3') will be homographically related when the anharmonic ratios
(that is, the corresponding anharmonic ratios) of the two sets are equal. If any one of the anharmonic ratios be equal to unity, then the four terms of the set
taken in a proper manner in pairs, will be harmonics; thus the equation Bl gives
