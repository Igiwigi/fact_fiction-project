first oblique to the axial line, was upon the supervention of the magnetic forces
drawn into the axial position instead of being driven into the equatorial line, or
remaining in some oblique direction, then I considered it magnetic. Or, if being
near one magnetic pole, it was attracted by the pole, instead of being repelled, then
I concluded it was magnetic. It is evident that the test is not striet, because, as
before pointed out (2285.), a body may have a slight degree of magnetic force, and
yet the power of the new property be so great as to nentralize or snrpass it. In the
first case, it might seem neither to have the one property nor the other ; in the second
case, it might appear free from magnetism, and possessing the special property in a
small degree.

2291. I obtained the following metals, so that when examined as above, they did
not appear to be magnetic ; and in fact if magnetic, were 80 to an amount s0 small
as not to destroy the results of the other force, or-to stop the progress of the inquiry.

Antimony. Lead.
Bizmuth, Mercury.
Cadmium, Silver,
Copper. Tin.
Gold. | Zine,

2292. The following metals were, and are as yet to me, magnetic, and therefore
companions of iron, nickel and cobalt :â€”
Platinum,
Palladium.
