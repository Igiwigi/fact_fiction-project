MOTOR CORTEX AND INTERNAL CAPSULE IN AN ORANG-OUTANG. 147

Face Region —Combination appeared to be universally distributed over the region
for the face.

Upper Limb.—Combination was only found in the squares for representation of the
small muscles (at squares 83, 28, 29, 50), z.e., at the highest part of the hand region.

Lower Limb.—Combination occurred most at the squares situated in the vertical
line drawn towards the middle of the lower limb region.

These facts are simply examples of the principle which we have previously
enunciated, viz., that the representation of function is most intense on the summits
of the gyri, and shades off to the sulci, where the excitability becomes nil.

(B) Internal Capsule.

We next proceed to raise the upper half of the right hemisphere (after ligature of
the middle cerebral artery deeply in the Sylvian fissure just in front of the anterior
limb of that fissure) by a horizontal section carried through the brain, as shown by the
dotted line in fig. 1, Plate 16, so as to expose the internal capsule. See fig. 5,
Plate 17.

Description.—The section exposing the internal capsule of the right hemisphere was a
