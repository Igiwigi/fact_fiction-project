When a little water was put over the mercury, the spark
was greatly diminished in brilliancy, but yery regular both on making and breaking
contact. When the contact was made between clean platina, the spark was also very
small, but regular both ways. The true electric spark is, in fact, very small, and
when surfaces of mercury are nsed, it is the combustion of the metal which produces
the greater part of the light. The circumstances connected with the burning of the
mereury are most favourable on breaking contact ; for the act of separation exposes
clean surfaces of metal, whereas, on making contact, a thin film of oxide, or 80il-
ing matter, often interferes. Hence the origin of the general opinion that it is only
when the contact is broken that the spark passes.
