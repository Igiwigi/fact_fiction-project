surface of their ever having been vascularly connected with the maternal uterus, and
reviewing all the facts observed I should undoubtedly say that the animal was oviparous.

Dr. MUELLER, in transmitting me the foregoing copy of the Gold-Receiver's letter,
writes (November 25th, 1864), © Since writing to you by last mail I have received the
enclosed letter respecting the Ornithorhynchus having proved to be * oviparous.” How are
all these statements to be reconciled ?”

As8uming the fact of the ovipogition, in the month of December 1863 (Dr. NicnoLs0N
writes of the occurrence as having happened < about ten months” before the date of his
letter, September 21, 1864) by a female Ornithorhynchus, of two ova, about the size of a
crow's egg, © white, soft, compressible, without shell or anything approaching to a calca-
reous covering,” the question is—What did they contain? Had the unvascular chorion
been cut or torn open, an embryo or a yelk might have been seen. Better till would it
have been if both ova had been at once immersed in a bottle of whatever colourless

| alcoholic liquor might be at hand. Probably no medical man had ever an opportunity
or a chance of settling a point in Comparative Physiology of more interest, and with less
trouble, than the gentleman who was privileged to be the first person to see and handle
the new-laid eggs of the Ornithorhynchus paradorus.
