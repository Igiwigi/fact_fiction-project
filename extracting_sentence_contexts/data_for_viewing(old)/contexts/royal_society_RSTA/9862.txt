ANOMALOUS BEHAVIOUR OF DELICATE BALANCES, ETC. 411

The small undulations which occur in the first part of this curve cannot be due to
flexure of the beam, for it was found that the sensibility of this particular balance
was precisely the same for all loads. Neither could they have been caused by
fluctuations in the temperature, for those would have been detected by the bolometer.

The observed variations therefore probably owe their origin, as we have already
suggested, to some slight relative movement of the agate knife-edges consequent upon
the loading of the beam. The correctness of this view may also be inferred from the
fact that when the above experiment is repeated with the balance duly fatigued, the
obtained R.P. curve is a right line wholly free from undulations.

We may therefore conclude that the slight periodic variations which the bolometer
has shown to exist in the temperature within the usual balance case, are responsible
for the more or less harmonic motions recorded in the R.P. curve ; and it appears very
probable that these effects must always be detectable in a sensitive balance, the beam
of which is not guarded in some such manner as we have indicated.

Of the Major Undulations to be Found in a Resting-Point Curve.

It may be observed that when an experienced worker is using a balance, he places
the required weights upon the pan at approximately equal intervals of time. As each
