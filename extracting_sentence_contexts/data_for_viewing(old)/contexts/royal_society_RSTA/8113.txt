through many mica discs, were contained in thin-walled resistance glass tubes.
The open end was so fitted as to make an airtight joint.

The thermometers in use (either Nos. 4, 2 or 5) were always balanced with No. 3
thermometer in circuit, the latter being maintained in a steam bath. ‘The difference
between the resistance of the thermometer and that of No. 3 thermometer was measured.
The fixed platinum resistance N (about 20 ohms), wound as a thermometer, but exactly
compensated for change of temperature, was inserted in the case of the resistance box
for convenience. The fundamental interval of each thermometer was about 5 ohms,
so that the unit bridge coil (approx. 0-1 ) corresponded to 2° on the platinum scale.

Each resistance coil of the box was compensated as described by CaLLenpary,
in fact, the same bridge was used. All contacts were either copper to copper soldered

or by cups filled with clean mercury. The battery current could be reversed so that
external effects might be eliminated, and the current could be changed by a plug
resistance R.

The galvanometer deflection was zero when the compensation coils of the box, P,
