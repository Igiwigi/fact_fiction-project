no effect on tissues that have not been previously sensitized by oestrone. The in-
effectivity of progesterone is also of interest in so far as it indicates that this hormone
cannot be concerned in the embryonic differentiation of the female reproductive
tract. Whether or not the hormone that is concerned is an oestrogenic substance is
yet to be determined. It is difficult to believe that it can be in view of the fact that
these substances are not sex specific in their action.

As has been implied above, the monhormonic hypothesis of sexual differentiation
would not conflict with the fact of the reactivity of the uterus masculinus and of the
hydatids of Morgagni to oestrone if it were assumed that these regions of the primordial
female reproductive tract became fully differentiated and determined during the
sexually indifferent phase of embryonic life. The strength of such an assumption
would, however, necessarily depend on the strength of this particular hypothesis, into
whose experimental basis it is not necessary to enquire here. But neither on this view
nor on the more conservative dihormonic hypothesis is it understandable why the
cranial and caudal parts of the Miillerian ducts should continue to survive in the males
of so many species after the disappearance of the rest of the ducts. These regions of the
ducts, it is stated, persist in vertebrates as widely different as selachians and primates.
This particular problem, however, like that of the occasional simultaneous presence
in mammals of normal-sized male and female internal reproductive organs, is open
only to speculation, and it is unlikely to be answered until much more is known than
