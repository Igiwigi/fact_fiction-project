Obviously there are many further
questions arising out of the above result. Evidently a study of the phase constitutes
a method of considerable delicacy for advancing our knowledge of disturbances ; but
a very obvious consideration is that in order to obtain even approximately smooth
diurnal inequalities from highly disturbed days one must deal with a long period of
years. When diurnal inequalities are not smooth, merely “accidental” irregularities
may introduce a fictitious element into the Fourier coefficients, especially those of
shorter period. The results reached emphasise one difficulty in the way of an exact inter-
comparison of stations. Even if all stations suffered equally from disturbance, their
published data would not be strictly comparable unless the standard for omitting
disturbed days when forming the diurnal inequality were absolutely uniform.
