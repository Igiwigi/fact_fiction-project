On comparing these results with the previous ones, it is clear that a different fixation
point is used for yellow rays from that used for green rays. This fact will be referred to in
the next section. (148) The positions of the fixation points for different colours

Evidence was produced (in § 120, p. 613) that different fixation points are used for rays of
different colour.
