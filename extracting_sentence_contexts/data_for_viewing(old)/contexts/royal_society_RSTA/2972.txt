Ga 4x6"). (2.6)
W(x) and n(x’) satisfy
L(x) u(x) =0 (2.7)
and
Oy (x L(x’) = 0, (2.8)

where the index m (n) is the quantum number and cy and dm are coefficients that will be
determined in the framework of McMillan’s theory. We can take the transpose on both sides of
equation (2.8)

LOX) Pn(x’) =0, (2.9)
To find the proper form of L(x')", we should use the fact Kye = ke yz, where key z is a real
space operator kee yz = —idy yz’. For example, if we have a 2 by 2 Hamiltonian
Ax) = So hilke ky, ke6i, (2.10)
i
where 6;=9,1,2,3 is Pauli matrix, AT (x’) is then expressed by
AT (x) =O hi(—ky, ky, ke). (2.11)
i
For convenience, we define a ‘new’ operator H as
A(x) =Al (x), (2.12)

As seen from the 2 by 2 example of equation (2.11), one can find the general relation that the wave
function ® of H(x) and the wave function W of H!(x) have one-to-one correspondence
