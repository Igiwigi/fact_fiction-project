Besides this, a portion of the posterior
leg on the same side had been removed at the tibial joint, and this had now been re-
produced with the tarsus and claw. Tt now formed a short leg, very obtuse at its
extremity, with the minute black claw sunk in its apex. This fact sufficiently proved
to me that a power of reproduction exists in insects which undergo a complete meta-
morphosis, as well as in those which do not change their form, and it led me to watch
with greater assiduity the passing of these individuals into the pupa state. At the expiration of nine days from the commencement of the experiments (June
1st), one of the larve, that was nearly full-grown when operated on, snspended itself
to enter the pupa state. At that time there were only seventeen specimens $till living
out of the twenty-eight originally employed, and four of these died soon after.
