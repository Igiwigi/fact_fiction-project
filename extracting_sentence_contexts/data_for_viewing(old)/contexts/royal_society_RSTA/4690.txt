estimate given by proposition 4.1. In particular, we cannot use this argument to prove global
existence, as the constants grow in time; however, in part (c) of the proposition, we have used a
more sophisticated argument based on the maximum principle to infer the sign-definiteness of
the term dyq; after a fixed amount of time has passed.

Proof of theorem 1.4. Assume for contradiction that T <oo. For any té[Tx,T7[, the energy

Note here the absence of the exponentially growing term in the above bound as compared to eal
inequality (4.8). This is due to the fact that terms Sr, Sr Anquld%al w dx, || + 21 < 6, are positive eae
and no longer treated as error terms. By absorbing the small multiple of E(t) into the left-hand a]
side, and using the positivity of dq; from step 2, we obtain that DN

by (4.8). Finally, we choose €9 in the statement of theorem 1.4 so that €9 < €/2. The bound (4.14)
and the condition E(0) < €9/F(K) (with F(K) given as in (1.15)) imply

E(t) < 5 te[T,T).

Together with lemma 3.1, we infer that the bootstrap assumptions (2.1) and (2.2) are improved.
Since E(-) is continuous in time, we can extend the solution by the local well-posedness theory to
