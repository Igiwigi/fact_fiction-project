In practice, however, this
is quite unnecessary ; and it will be seen from the diagram in fig. 3 that even in this
exceptional case no very considerable error results from taking the curve W W as a fair
Arepresentation of the distribution of the weight. This follows from the fact that the
Seurve W W averages, 0 to speak, the inequalities of W' W' W', and, on the length of 40
Sfeet considered, includes a nearly equal area ; that is, represents as nearly as possible the
S8ame weight. On this account, when considering the strength of a ship as a whole, we

ay avail ourselves safely of the method previously described, taking the planes of divi-
Sion, say, 20 feet apart in large ships; but excessively concentrated weights necessarily
Zeause severe {ocal-bending- and shearing-strains, which must be specially provided against. St will snffice here to say that shipbuilders depend chiefly upon longitudinal bearers or
-Zkeelsons to distribute such concentrated loads over a considerable length, and prevent
Ztheir exercising a prejudicial effect on the structure.
