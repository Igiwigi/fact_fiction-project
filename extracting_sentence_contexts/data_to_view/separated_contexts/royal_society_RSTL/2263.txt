Whateyer intensity may
be, (and that must of course depend upon the nature of electricity, whether it con-
sist, of a fluid or fluids, or of vibrations of an ether, or any other kind or condition of
matter,) there seems to be no difficulty in comprehending that the degree of intensity
at which a current of electricity is eyolved by a first voltaic element, shall be in-
creased when that current is subjected to the action of a second voltaic element,
acting in conformity and possessing equal powers with the first : and as the decom-
positions are merely opposed actions, but exactly of the same kind as those which
generate the current (917.), it seems to be a natural consequence, that the affinity
which can resist the force of a single decomposing action shall be unable to oppose the
energies of many decomposing actions, operating conjointly, as in the voltaic battery.

995. That a body which can give way to a current of feeble intensity should giye
way more freely to one of stronger force, and yet inyolve no contradiction to the
law of definite electrolytic action, is perfectly consistent. All the facts and also the
theory I have ventured to put forth, tend to show that the act of decomposition
opposes a certain force to the passage of the electric current ; and that this obstruc-
tion should be overcome more or less readily, in proportion to the greater or less
intensity of the decomposing current, is in perfect consistency with all our notions
of the electric agent.

996. I have elsewhere (947.) distinguished the chemical action of zinc and dilute
sulphuric acid into two portions; that which, acting effectually on the zinc, eyolyes
hydrogen at once upon its surface, and that which, producing an arrangement of the
chemical forces throughout the electrolyte present, (in this case water,) tends to take
oxygen from it, but cannot do s0 unless the electric current consequent thereon can
have free passage, and the hydrogen be delivered elsewhere than against the zine. The electric current depends altogether upon the second of these ; but when the
current can pass, by fayouring the electrolytic action it tends to diminish the former
and increase the latter portion.
