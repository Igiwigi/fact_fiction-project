These findings suggest that self-relevance is important to how social concepts influence spatial judgments. Consistent with this suggestion, Maddox et al. [132] demonstrated how the socially relevant concept of race can influence spatial
inferences. Participants learned the location of a number of features in a fictional city. Many of these locations were associated
with different racial groups. For example, some businesses were described as primarily serving Black or White customers
and a dry cleaning business was described as having an owner with an Asian-American name.
