serious. The values interpolated are probably rarely wrong by more than one unit in the
last place, except in the case of those in the column furthest to the left (where the variation of
the function is most rapid), and even here the fractional error must usually be small. The
most dubious interpolated figures occur in table 4 and are enclosed in brackets; fortunately,
they are located in a relatively unimportant region.

The computations become more and more laborious as n# increases. It was decided
therefore to make a limited use of extrapolation. This might at first appear a somewhat
dubious operation, but in fact it is fully justifiable. Thus in the relevant region, at the
extreme right of the tables, .¥ (nt, n*,/) varies remarkably slowly along a row. In addition,
it was possible to lock the extrapolated columns at a number of points by evaluating the
function at integral values of both n#., and n¥ using a formula due to Gordon (1929), who
showed that for such values of n#_, and n#
