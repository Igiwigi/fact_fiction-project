This substance does not appear to be very scarce. Among
the crystallized carbonates of lime preserved in Mr. GreviLLE's
collection, I have met with about a dozen specimens of it,
most of which came either from Carinthia, or from Transyl-
vania, or from Scotland. The beautiful and delicately white
stalactitical $ubstance, hitherto known by the name of flos ferr;,
generally belongs to the substance here described, particularly |
certain pieces of it, which have their ramifications covered with
small brilliant asperities, giving them the appearance of fine
satin. These little asperities, all of which are inclined, in the
same direction, to the axes of the various ramifications, are in
fact so many very perfect but minute crystals, which most com-
monly belong to the forementioned flat pyramidal varieties.

Among the specimens of this kind of carbonate of lime which
came from Carinthia, there exist some, in which the sharp py-
ramids are very small, and appear as if planted almost perpendi-
cularly in the matrix. These specimens may, from the above
circumstance, be more easily confounded with: the common
carbonate of lime in small needle-like crystals; there is, how-
ever, the following difference between them, namely, that in
the common carbonate of lime, we cannot touch these little
* crystals, though ever s0 lightly, without breaking them; whereas,
in the substance here described, the crystals are capable of
