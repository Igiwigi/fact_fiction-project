The existence of such a surface of section is closely connected with that of two-dimensional surfaces of
section as studied by Porncaré and Brrxuorr (loc, cit.). We do not enquire here what restriction, if any,
is imposed on the system (14.1) by making this hypothesis. As a simple example, take

BE f (yr/ar, Lay ys) + e738? +H),
where f is one-signed for all real x, y1, %, ys; then it will be found that
d (tan- y/x
( 7 yl) “a

= constant,

so any surface of the family y/2 = constant is « surface of section. This example illustrates the fact that
the existence of a surface of section does not imply that the system is “ soluble.”

Any periodic trajectory cuts #7 in a finite number of points, and from reasons of
continuity combined with the characteristic property of } it is apparent that for
trajectories which correspond to periodic solutions of any one family F the number of such
intersections is the same. We define the order of a periodic solution as the number of
points in which the corresponding trajectory cuts 47. Along any family ff, then, the
order 7 is invariable (and, of course, integral), and the family is represented within 47 by
n analytic curves L,, ... 1,, in which the corresponding family of trajectories cuts ¥7.

Now let Jf, be a real family of periodic solutions which branches from JF at a solution
=, having the period T' and characteristic ratio A/vo. Then for ff, the period tends to
