studies often use foods, goods also include tools, activities and services. Subjec-
tive value generalizes the notion that the value of two apples is not double the
value of a single apple. Instead, subjective value is conditional on a person’s
wealth level (satiety level for foods; [5,6]), on the framing of the decision pro-
blems [7-9] and on the characteristics of the choice set such as the presence
and properties of a third option [10-12]. These forms of conditional preferences
are also observed in primates [13-16].

Conditional valuation is especially important when goods are not consumed
alone but together with other goods (joint consumption). For example, animals
eat berries together with leaves and humans may combine bread with butter,
coffee with milk, or pasta with tomato sauce. In this sense, conditional valuation
is ubiquitous in humans, reflecting the fact that goods are almost never valued
independently of each other. Indeed, if they were, consumers would always
use their entire budget for the best value-for-money product. Yet, in the super-
market, we do not see shopping carts filled with only oranges, or only carrot
juice. Goods are consumed in combination (economists call them ‘bundles’),
and valuation is conditional on bundle composition. This fact is so deeply
built into modern economics that the idea of ‘value’ makes little sense for
