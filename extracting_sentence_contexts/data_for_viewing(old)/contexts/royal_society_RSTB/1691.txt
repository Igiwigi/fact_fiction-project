Since therefore the derivation is capable of stimulating the tissue, it is certain that
the more intense current which flows through the actual active strip can excite
it and thus renew its activity.

It will be noted that with the derivation, it needed, as far as our observations
have gone, two such successive shocks of the response of the primary strip to arouse
the secondary one, which accordingly reacted synchronously with the third change,
but it is obvious that with the intenser current which must be present in the actual
excited tissue which is the seat of the change each single electrical effect may
be fully adequate to stimulate it. Thus it appears that one actual causative factor
of the peripheral rhythm is the susceptibility of the organ to excitation by its own
electrical response. The criticisms advanced by ScHONLEIN* in the case of the
Torpedo do not lay sufficient stress upon the undoubted fact that a portion of organ
can be excited by the response of another contiguous part.

This explanation is further supported by comparing the period of delay of the
primary strip with the interval of time between any succeeding electrical change in
the response and that of its predecessor. The measurements of a considerable
number of records give results which may be summed up as follows :—If LP is
the latent period of the initial change, D the duration of this change, and I the
interval between the termination of the first change and the commencement of the
second, then out of thirty-one records, in three cases LP = D+ TI, in fourteen
LP was greater than D+ TI by a time interval varying from joo to yen second,
and in fourteen LP was less than D-+TI by a time interval varying from y¢55 to
tesa second, but reaching in three cases a maximum of about yoo second, which
