which are theorems relating to any three functions A, B, C whatever. 365, I remark upon the proof that the really fundamental theorem seems to be that
which I haye called theorem A. As to the forms W it is difficult to see & priori why
8nch forms are to be considered, or what the essential property involved in their definition
is; and in fact in a more recent paper, © Die Simultanen Systeme biniren Formen ”
(Clebsch and Neumann, t. 2 (1869), see p. 256), Professor GoRDAXN has modified the defi-
nition of the forms W by omitting the condition that the order of the function shall
exceed n; if it were possible further to omit the condition of at least one index being
= or<Jn, and 80 only retain the conditions n—1, n—/, &c., each of them >0, then the
essential property of the forms W would be that any such form was a rational and inte-
gral function of the special covariants formed, as above, by means of the quantie of the
next inferior order. And moreoyer, as regards the theorem B, there seems something
