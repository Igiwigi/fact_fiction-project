Little need here be said of the Madrepora septum. Its agreement with Turbinaria
is seen in the possession of a well-marked, darker central axis of deposit directed
from the porous wall inwards (¢f also Part IT., pp. 270, 279). The peculiarity of the
septal apparatus of Madrepora, as compared with that of Turbinaria, is in the fact
that a number of the smaller cycles of septa are represented by vertical series of
spines. These ‘‘septal spines” of Madrepora have exch a single centre of calcification which

in some species appears as a ring at its base, in others has itself a broad base and
narrow tip. Its variation in form is always correlated with some external difference
of shape in the spine itself.
