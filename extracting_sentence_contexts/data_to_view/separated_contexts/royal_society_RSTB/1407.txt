There is, however, no doubt, from the evidere
impressions and casts, that the roots arose at the node or immediately above itfr
the base of the internode. Sometimes they were placed in a regular circle, om
times they are grouped in tufts, and these tufts may arise at the base of a bel
It does not seem probable, however, that they had any constant relation tt
branches, such as we find in Equisetum. So far as our knowledge of the external morphology of the vegetative
Calamites extends, we thus find a general agreement with Equisetum, suffici
quite consistent with a relationship between the genera, but not by itself

(1.) It has already been mentioned that in the course of the vascular bun
resemblance to Equisetum, though evident, is incomplete ; the differences
the facts that a bundle may traverse more than one internode, and that the
of successive internodes do not constantly alternate with one another (see
photograph 5, and Plate 78, fig. 11).
