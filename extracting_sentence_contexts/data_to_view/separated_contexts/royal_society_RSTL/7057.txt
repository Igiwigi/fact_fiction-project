A foreign gas will answer for the vacuum, as in
the experiments of Dr. MITCHELL.
= BD The numbers for the'velocity of passage of the different gases in the last Table may
* taken also as representing not remotely the relative absorption and liquefaction of
So various gases by the substance of rubber. Z The passage of gases through rubber is also illustrated by the rapid collapse of the
tle balloon when filled with carbonic acid gas, or even with hydrogen, or with marsh-gas,
compared with atmospheric air. 'The conyerse fact is observed when the inflating
Ss is pure nitrogen : then the balloon is found to become further distended after a few

Urs, in consequence of more oxygen entering from the atmosphere without, than of

Wtrogen escaping from the balloon during the same time ; while the composition is being
Squalized on both sides of the membrane, and the gas within the balloon is finally of the
me compoxsition as the external air, A rubber balloon filled with nitrogen was found. Shen roughly gauged, to increase in diameter from 132 to 136 millims. in the course of

Byenty-four hours. On the other hand, a balloon filled with pure oxygen fell in the

Que time from 150 to 113 millims. in diameter.
