three segments occur between segments 14 and 22, whilst sections of three occur
again towards the tail end, following four or five sections of four. . It is clear, there-
fore, that if the anterior regeneration is exact, always stopping at the right segment,
all the specimens from three originals with more than nineteen segments in the
anterior regeneration, or those with nineteen segments and a growing piece, must
have come from one of the sections of three which occur near the tail end, behind
the sections of four, There are eight worms recorded which come under this head
(Nos. 21-28).

If we compare the specimens regenerated from three original segments with those
regenerated from four, it is clear that the anterior regenerations on the whole contain
more segments when the number of original segments is four, which agrees with the
fact that the sections of four lie behind the principal sections of three. Thus, whilst
from the sections of three there are ten specimens with eighteen or more segments
in the anterior regeneration (eight of which, as was shown, are probably derived from
the posterior sections of three), from the sections of four there are thirty-five
specimens with eighteen or more segments in the anterior regeneration. Also from
the sections of three there are four specimens with seventeen segments in the anterior
regeneration, from the sections of four there are eleven specimens.

On the other hand, the relative number of segments in the posterior regeneration
is larger in the specimens which have regenerated from three original segments than it
is in those which have regenerated from four. There are seventeen specimens derived
from three original segments in which the number of segments in the posterior
regeneration is 50 per cent. or more of the total regeneration, whereas there are only
