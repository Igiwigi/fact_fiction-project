Details of these experiments are given in Table VI, and it can be seen that in all of
them except the last (No. 32) the position of the wound, as indicated by its angle from

allowance is made for the fact that the angles P,-wound, as measured, were probably
about 3°+5 too small (see section 5), then these angles show that, except in No. 32, the
divergences of the wounds from the true median position ranged from about 6° to 11° in
the kathodic direction. On the other hand wounds which were more nearly median,
usually led to the development of I,k only, as in Nos. 16, 22, 24 and 25 (see Table II).
