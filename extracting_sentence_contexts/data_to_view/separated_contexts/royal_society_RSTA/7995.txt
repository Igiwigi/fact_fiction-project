Considering now the conditions obtaining within the narrow zone adjacent to the
propellant surface, we can follow Muraour in accepting that the temperature must
increase outwards from the propellant surface to a closely adjacent region, where the
absolute uncooled temperature of explosion is attained. Molecules moving from this
region towards the propellant surface will tend to drop in velocity, consequent on
temperature drop. On the other hand, collision effects, and the fact that the molecules
are of finite size, will tend to increase the effective molecular velocity in the direction
specified. The two effects are of a compensatory nature, and to allow for this the
conditions within the zone are assumed to be uncooled temperature T, and a gas
obeying the normal Boyie-Cuarzes law. A more rigorous treatment, if practicable,
would lead to the derivation of the molecular velocity in the form of a series, the
first and most important term of which would be given by the foregoing simplified
assumptions.
