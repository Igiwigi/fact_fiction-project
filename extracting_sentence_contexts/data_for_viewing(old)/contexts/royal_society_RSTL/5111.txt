f(a)=Cz,
C denoting a quantity independent of x, namely the value of f(x) when a=1. If x
be not a number, but some symbol, whether of specific quantity or operation, the
notation Cz has no meaning recognised in ordinary algebra. Hence, following the
well-known precedent of indices*, we may generalize the meaning of Cz by assuming
it to be the $ymbolical form for denoting every function, f (x), which is distributive.
If we further suppose, that F(z), and therefore C, is a distributive function of
another independent variable y, we shall find that
C=C\y. and... Cz=C'ay.
"Thus we may, by the same process of generalization, as8ume C'zy to be the $ymbolical
form for denoting every function of x and y which is distributive with regard to both
randy. C' here is manifestly the value of the function when x=1 and y=1. Now
if we adopt C' to be the unit of the function, as, in fact, we do in many cases of
ordinary produets, the symbolic form for denoting the function becomes simply ay.
(7.) This appears to'me to. be the simplest and best method of defining the nota-
tion zy in Symbolical Algebra; though I need not avail myself of it here as it is not
necessary for my purpose. All I require is some simple notation for denoting a dis-
tributive function of two variables ; for, as I hope to show, this distributiveness is a
characteristic of great importance to be distinetly * noted ” in the case of the trans-
lation of a directed magnitude. Now there are three different forms in which a pro-
duct is written in ordinary algebra, viz. ay .y and 2Xy: of these, the latter two
are now seldom used, and there is no necessity whatever for this redundancy of

* & has no meaning, according to its original definition, except a be a positive integer: but we give it a
meaning by defining « to be the notation for every function f (z) which possesses the property F(z)/(y)=/(@+9)-
