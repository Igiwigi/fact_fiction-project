The gynoecium is rather
peculiar in the apical projection of the axis (though this may be shown in Williamsonia
gigas and Cycadeoidea colossalis), and the seeds differ from those of Cycadeoidea and Wil-
liamsonia in being sessile, though again they are nearly sessile in W. scotica. It is suggested
that the long seed stalks of Cycadeoidea are an adaptation allowing a large number of
ovules to grow into fairly wide seeds in their peculiar position just within a spherical
surface. It is impossible to extract the full value from comparing the seed of Williamsoniella
because of uncertainty about fact. Wielandiella is known to have possessed an elongated
seed which yields cuticles of extremely similar appearance (Harris 1932, p. 86). From the
fact that the integument below the micropyle is lined with cuticle and the nucellus is
also cutinized, it follows that the nucellus is ‘free’.
