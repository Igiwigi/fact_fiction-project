So to check whether a graph state has a certain qubit-minor we can check if the corresponding
graph has a certain vertex-minor. Note that one can also include the case where G’ has vertices of
degree zero. Let us denote the vertices of G’ which have degree zero as U. We then have that

IG’) <|G) = G[V(G)\U]<G. (2.26)

(f) Rank-width

In this section, we introduce the notion of rank-width, which is a complexity measure of a
graph. It is in some ways similar to the tree-width, introduced in [21]. The tree-width captures
essentially how tree-like the graph is. This is useful for finding algorithms for problems on graphs
of bounded tree-width, motivated by the fact that many graph problems are easy on trees. More
on algorithms for problems on graphs of bounded tree-width can be found in [22]. Rank-width,


compared to tree-width, captures a larger class of graphs with similar complexity. For example,
the complete graph has very low complexity, due to its highly symmetric nature, but the tree-
width is in this case maximal. On the other hand, the rank-width is one for both trees and complete
graphs. In fact, it turns out that the graphs of rank-width one are exactly the distance-hereditary
graphs, see [23].

We start by defining the cut-rank of a graph. To do this, we will use the following notation
for a graph G with vertices V and adjacency matrix I and two subsets of the vertices A,B C V;
IA, B] is the |A| x |B|-matrix describing the connections between the sets A and B. So, foraeA
