The families of Annelids selected for examination will be placed in juxtaposition,
more on account of an affinity of type presented by the © segmental organ ” than in
deference to any other principle of classification. The Naidea, Lumbricidea, Hirudinea, 'Terebellidze, Nereide, &c. will on this ground
be taken in the order in which they are named. Naidea.—lIn his Report* on the Annelids, the author made the following statement
with reference to the segmental organ in the genus Nats: © The whote reproductive
system is limited by Ducts to the glandular mass which is s0 readily observed about the
anterior third of the body, whereas in reality this only constitutes one 8eqmental unit,
more developed only than those which are repeated in every ring of the body.”
Although in the present memoir the author will avail himself of the opportunity to cor-
rect certain inaccuracies committed in his * Report ” with respect to the interpretation
there given in relation to the segmental organ in Nats, he will only at present observe,
that in 1852 he drew attention to the fact that the generative structures were developed
upon one, two or more of the segmental organs common to almost every ring of the
body. To M. Ducks the segmental organs, as distributed throughout the two posterior
thirds of the body, were unknown.
