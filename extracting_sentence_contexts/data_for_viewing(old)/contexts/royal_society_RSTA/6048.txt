deformation defined by the tensor L. The applied incremental deformation L is chosen to be
the macroscopic zero-energy mode corresponding to the given radial loading path. In turn, the
macroscopic zero-energy modes are obtained by evaluating, on the PD boundary, the eigenvectors
Le leading to failure of the PD condition (4.2), or second-order work C[Ler] - Ler =0. Then, by
solving equation (3.9) and using equation (3.3), the actual displacement field of the lattice can
be determined and visualized. Figure 7 refers to a uniaxial tensile prestress state upon which an
incremental simple shear L =e; ® e2 is applied. Figure 8 refers to a biaxial stress path inclined
at 30° with respect to the horizontal axis and an incremental deformation L = 0.866025 e; ® e2 +
0.5e2 @ e1.

It is worth noting that the zero-energy mode for uniaxial tension (figure 7b) highlights the
peculiar interplay, occurring at the instability threshold, between the local deformation of the
unit cell and the macroscopic deformation. In fact the bifurcation mode shows the sliders within
each cell opening vertically while enabling an overall horizontal macroscopic shearing. Note also
