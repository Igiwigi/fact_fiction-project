Analysis of the time curves for P and 8 led Wrecuertr and Zéprritrz to the
conclusion that the corresponding seismic rays do not travel in straight lines from
the focus, but that they dip down into the earth as if the speed of propagation
increased with the depth. The results of their investigation will be found in
Gauitzin’s ‘Lectures on Seismometry, or my own mpnograph on ‘ Modern
Seismology.’

The surface values are 7°17 km. per second for P and 4'01 km. per second for 8. These are substantially higher than the values found for surface rocks, and emphasize
the fact that in using the term surface we do, on this view, imagine the heterogeneous
crust of the earth replaced by a purely ideal surface at which the speeds acquire the
values stated. The justification of this assumption and the determination of the true
effect of the crust will have to be undertaken before long. We have now to consider the magnitude of the ground movement experienced
when a wave is incident on the surface.
