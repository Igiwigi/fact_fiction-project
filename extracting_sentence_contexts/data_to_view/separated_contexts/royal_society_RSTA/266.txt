If L is non-singular we have y — Qx, where Q — L~'M; and similarly z — Rx, say, by
eliminating y from (1). The points on A, B, C of a generating line of the scroll are given
by Ax, BQx, CRx. In fact the scroll is now

loc {ps Ix, oCRx}, (6)

with p:o and x as parameters of stratum and generating line respectively. This reverts
to the previous form §1 (10) when 4 — {7,0}, CR = {0,1}. The parametric form of the scroll, referred to the basis A — {7,0}, C {0,7} and
containing {B,, B,} as another stratum, is therefore

loc {pB, x, 7B, x}, (7)

and the points {B,x, 0} of A, {0, B,x} of C are in line with (Bx, Bx}, that is with Bx
of B. Such points a and ¢ will be called reflexions of b through B on to A and C, and will
be denoted by an arrow relation

abe or briefly a—c.
