P’ is the generalized free product of the groups G',. (7-5)
Proof. We choose as systems €, of generators of G, simply all the elements of G),; their union
€ = Vz,
then evidently generates P’. As system ®, of defining relations of G!, we simply have all the
equations Ayes
that express the fact that the product of the two elements a, b in G’, is just the element
ce G’,. We wish to show that the union of all these systems of relations,
R= Vz Ris
suffices to define P’. As G’, is a homomorphic image of G,, the relations R, must at least
)=1 (peP,), (7-1)
which correspond to the defining relations of G,.
