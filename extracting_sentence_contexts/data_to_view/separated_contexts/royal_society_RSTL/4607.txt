At the time these inquiries were begun, and nearly up to the period of their completion, I had not scen any
of the works of Dr. STiLLixG, and knew no more of his investigations into the structure of the spinal chord
than what I had gathered from the anatomical and physiological works published .in this country. However
nearly, therefore, a few of the facts brought forward in this paper may correspond to the results of his in-
quiries, I may state that they were made out without any knowledge of Dr. STiLLIxG's views, excepting only
those which regard the origin of the spinal nerves. On showing some of my preparations to Mr. SouLy and
Mr. GrarixGer, I was advised by those gentlemen to look over the works of Dr. STILLING ; and having done
80, I shall refer to them whenever they appear to oppose, or coincide with, my own observations. 412
