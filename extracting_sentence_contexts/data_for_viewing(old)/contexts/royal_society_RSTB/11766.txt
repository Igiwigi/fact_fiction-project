(20-50 Hz) and low-frequency (1-4 Hz) components of the
EEG signal, Siclari et al. found that the presence or absence
of consciousness correlated with local changes in high- and
low-frequency activity, irrespective of global EEG character-
istics. According to Siclari ef al., the occurrence of dream
experiences correlates with a decrease in the low-frequency
EEG component localized to a so-called ‘posterior hot zone’
(low- and high-level sensory areas, precuneus, posterior
cingulate, retrosplenial cortex). Consequently, Siclari ef al.
argue that, in line with the conclusions of recent no-report
paradigms [38,100-—102,106—108,111], their findings support
the view that previously highlighted frontal NCC com-
ponents were, in fact, confounds, and the true neural correlate
of consciousness can be localized to posterior areas.

Note that this claim is in tension with the findings regard-
ing dIPFC activity in REM sleep discussed above [44-48], as
those findings imply some frontal activity. Indeed, despite
the authors’ emphasis on the posterior hot zone [31,38,101],
even Siclari et al. reported increased frontal activity: in cases
of successful dream recalls versus having no dream experi-
ences the high-frequency EEG component increased in areas
extending outside the posterior hot zone to parts of lateral
frontal cortex (including dIPFC, especially in REM) and tem-
poral lobes (see fig. 3c in [31]). Others also reported that
