weight compounds (Cj)—C») [54]. Petrogenesis produces
HMW r-alkanes, but results in a CPI of 1 and generally a


mid-chain (~C25) concentration maximum, neither of which
characterizes the Nachukui samples. There are no known sig-
nificant production pathways from microbial sources for
HMW n-alkanoic acids in soils or lacustrine sediments, but
microbes may produce small (and probably insignificant)
quantities of these compounds [54]. The absence of signifi-
cant post-depositional sources of HMW n-alkanoic acids or
n-alkanes indicates that the compounds we have isolated
and measured are in fact derived from terrestrial plant
waxes. This leaves degradation of compounds as the other
major pathway by which alteration of the original plant
wax isotope ratio may occur.

Several studies have shown that the concentration of
n-alkanes in soils decreases with time, indicating degradation
of plant waxes, probably via microbial processes [55-58].
Results are conflicting however, on whether or not the isotope
ratio is affected by early diagenesis, which is probably associ-
ated with microbial processes. Huang ef al. [55] found no
change in 85°C values of HMW 1-alkanes (Co7-Ca3) over 23
years of organic matter decomposition. In contrast, Chikaraishi
