subspace into which the projections of 2; have the largest variance.

In recent years, attention has been directed at settings in which a nonlinear
manifold of low dimension might provide a better representation. For example,
a collection of images of similar objects is nominally very high-dimensional

(corresponding to the number of pixels in each image), but in fact potentially
described by the variation of a much smaller number of parameters. Some
influential approaches to this problem include ISOMAP (Tenenbaum et al. 2000),
local linear embedding (Roweis & Saul 2000), Laplacian eigenmaps (Belkin &
Niyogi 2003) and Hessian eigenmaps (Donoho & Grimes 2003).

These nonlinear representations can also be described as spectral methods for
dimension reduction, because each involves finding a small number of extreme
eigenvalue/vector pairs for a suitable matrix derived from the local characteristics
of the data (a;). These and other methods are reviewed by Belabbas & Wolfe
(in press) in this volume.

The computational burden of solving an eigenproblem can be significant
