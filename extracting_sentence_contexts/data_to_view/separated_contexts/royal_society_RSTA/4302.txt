This is a contradiction to the circularity of X. The converse follows with similar arguments. Clearly, the above result also gives a handy criterion for the C> property of trinucleotide codes,
namely by the fact that a code is CÂ° if and only if the graph of X as well as the graphs of the two
circularly permuted sets of trinucleotides of X are acyclic. Recently, C? codes played an important
role in the theory of error detection in genetic information. In particular, the maximal trinucleotide
circular code X observed in genes of bacteria, eukaryotes, plasmids and viruses [12,15] initiated a
renewed interest and had another interesting property, namely self-complementarity.
