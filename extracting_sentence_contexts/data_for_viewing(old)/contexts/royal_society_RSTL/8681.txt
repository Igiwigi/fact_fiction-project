+ I am aware that tho conclusion here stated, and which scems to me well established by the above facts,
apparently stands in diametric contradiction to the conclusions which Heraaxy (f Archiv fiir Physiologie,”
Band x. Hefte 2 & 3, p. 77) has arrived at from a few similar experiments on the motor centres of the brain of
dogs. He concludes that because dogs ultimately recover completely from such disturbances of motor func-
tions as are a firs caused by the ablation of cortical centres, these centres cannot be motor in the true sense
of the term. Experiments on dogs, however, are not strictly comparable with experiments on monkeys ; and
the relative subordination and association of lower centres in different animals is a fact which ought to be
carefully considered. The explanation I have elsewhere given (* West Riding Reports,” yol. iti.) of how as80-
ciated movements, such as those of the limbs of dogs, can still be carried out through the associated action of
lower centres 80 long as the cortical centres of the other hemisphere are intact, is quite in harmony with the
facts Henaaxx gives, and is further demonstrated by the complete paralysis of voluntary motion which follows
the destruction of corresponding regions in both hemispheres in these animals.

Puperiments relating to the Localization of Sensory Perception'*,

Certain movements of the eyes, ears, and nostrils, obtained by stimulation of certain
convolutions already described, led me to regard them as the external manifestations of
sensations thus snbjectively aroused; and the following experiments were directed to
test the truth of this hypothesis, and to determine to what extent sensory localization
in the brain might be possible.
