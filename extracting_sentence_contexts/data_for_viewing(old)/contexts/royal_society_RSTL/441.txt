Sulphuric acid.* In the next place, it is very likely that his
solutions were sufficiently concentrate to give a precipitate of
Sulphate of lime. The same was the case with regard to his
mixture of muriate of strontia with muriate of alumina. As to
the general conclusion, that barytes has an affinity for lime,
magnesia, and alumina, which strontia does not appear to pos-
8ess, it is to be explained as follows. Lime often contains a little
sulphate of lime. Mr. GuyTon's magnesia, as well as his alu-
mina, had probably been obtained from the sulphate; and we
are indebted to Mr. BerTHoLLET, for the true nature of many
Similar precipitates,

* It is somewhat $ingular, that GuyTon Should have observed this fact elsewhere.
See his experiments on the diamond, in the Annales de Chimie. The preparation of
a barytic salt, by alumina prepared from the $ulphate of this earth, had been observed
by ScnzeLEs, in his Essay on the Affinities of Bodies. But that great chemist referred

the phenomenon to its right cause, viz, to some sulphuric acid remaining in all
alumina thus prepared.

Barytes is a much more delicate test than strontia, for sul-
phuric acid; and, therefore, barytic solutions were affected by
