points of interest. The deeper immersion of the stern in the wave-slope has the
effect (figs. 16 & 18) of producing an excess of buoyancy of 410 tons on the first 110 feet
of length, and the lowering of the water-level in the hollow causes a defect of buoyancy
of no less than 880 tons in the middle portion of the ship, where in still water the
excess of buoyancy is nearly as great. At the bow, however, eyen more striking results

are met with. Its transverse sections are 0 fine, and its weight is 80 great, that the
increased immersion does not suffice to entirely do away with the excess of weight
existing in still water; in fact on the first 20 feet of length there is a small excess of
weight (about 50 tons) still remaining; and we thus meet for the first time with a case
where the conditions of the two extremities of a ship differ, an excess of buoyancy
existing at one end simultaneously with an excess of weight at the other. In actual
s8hips at sea this must, often be 80, since the pitching and ascending motions are sure to
produce a deep immersion at one extremity simultaneously with the emersion of the
other extremity. Reverting to the * Minotaur' in the wave-hollow, I need only state that
the maximum shearing-force is found to be almost the same as that for still water (470
instead of 450 tons), and that the maximum bending-moment is also of nearly identical
amount with that for still water (44,000 instead of 45,000 foot-tons), only it is a sagging-
strain instead of a hogging-strain. In fact for five-sixths of her length the © Minotaur”
is subjected to sagging-strains when in the wave-hollow; and as the small excess of
weight at her bow can only be expected to existin armoured ships of her extreme length
