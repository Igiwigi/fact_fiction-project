482 Dr. BriNKLEY's remarks on

distance (about g0*) of « Lyrz g" greater in the beginning
of December or February than in the beginning of August
(these are about the middle times of the winter and summer
observations). The Greenwich instrument finds, by twenty
observations in summer, and twenty in winter, the double
altitude (about 154*) of « Lyra exactly the same. Comparing these naked facts together, the first impression
would be, notwithstanding the greater number of observa-
tions at Dublin, that the Greenwich result is more likely to
be right, because it -is more likely that two angles, that are
really equal, should be found equal, than that two angles,
really unequal, should be found equal, by the errors of ob-
servation: This is all the admission, that it appears to me, can be
made. When the collateral circumstances are examined,
unless I greatly deceive myself, the probability will be found
in favour of the exactness of the Dublin results ; and I cannot
but feel surprised, considering the experience Mr. Poxp has
had of the Greenwich circle, that he should attribute 8uch
weight to these results by reflection.
