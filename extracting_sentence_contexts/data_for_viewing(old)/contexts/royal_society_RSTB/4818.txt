arrangement of the fibrils.

wall, separate muscle cells being apparently absent. This is certainly not the case in
the Estheria nauplius. There are three separate muscle cells, and, furthermore, the
muscle fibrils are not accurately described as a ring. The fibrils develop on the lumen
side of each cell as a flat layer, and these, at their ends, join the fibrils of the adjacent
cells. In this way a triangular structure is formed rather than a ring of muscle fibrils
(text-fig. 5, Â¢).

In the metanauplius stages the coiled lumen in the distal cells develops considerably.
It has apparently well-differentiated walls that are distinct from the surrounding cyto-
plasm, and, in fact, it may now be termed a distinct duct running through the two
distal cells. The cytoplasm of the latter has now become full of deeply staining rods
that radiate from a reservoir that has formed in between the nuclei of the two cells.
This reservoir is thus almost completely surrounded by the coiled duct. As develop-
ment proceeds it increases in size, but the coiled duct always lies along its periphery.

Ultimately, when the gland becomes effete and dwindles, there is a very considerable
accumulation of secretion in the reservoir.

If the duct system of the antennal gland, apart from the end sac, is compared with
