From a consideration of the instances given above it is evident that the species ot
the order Carnivora show a very wide range of variation in their sexual and
reproductive capacity. That the recurrence of the cestrous cycle may be concurrent
with the seasons and may take place with a rhythmic regularity is well shown in
certain members of the group, while it is no less evident that the periods when heat
occurs are largely influenced by environmental conditions. Thus it is mentioned by
Biscuorr (1863) that the breeding season of the Fox is affected by the nature of the
country where it lives, and Mituais (1904) refers to the fact that whereas the cubs
of this animal in most parts of Great Britain are not born until the end of March or
beginning of April, in the South of England they are frequently produced as early
as January. The influences of domestication and captivity upon the periodicity of cestrus are
even more marked than those of climate, and the more frequent recurrence of the
cycle in the Ferret, the domestic Cat, and certain of the larger Carnivora in Zoological
Gardens must be ascribed to this cause. The periodicity of the cestrus in certain of
those animals in the Gardens at Dublin is said to be markedly affected by accom-
modation, heating, and feeding, and can to a certain extent at any rate be regulated.
