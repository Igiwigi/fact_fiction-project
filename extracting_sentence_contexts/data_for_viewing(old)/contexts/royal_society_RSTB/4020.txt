VERNON (95) suggested that the reason why his hybrids resembled Strongylo-
centrotus in the spring and Spherechinus in the summer might be due to the relative
ripeness of the two parent forms at the two seasons, summer being the maximum
period of maturity for Spherechinus and spring that for Strongylocentrotus. Any
such suggestion with regard to the Hchinus hybrids at Plymouth is excluded by the
facts stated above, that the inheritance was the same at the beginning and the end
of the ripeness period of each species as it was at its maximum.

As, therefore, no such changes in external conditions at the time of fertilization, or
after, can be made to account for the alteration in inheritance described in this paper,
we incline to the view that the physiological condition of the germ cells of at least
one of the parent species was affected by some alteration in the external environment
during the period of their growth. This opinion is supported by five facts, which at
the same time indicate that it was the female germ-cells of H. miliaris which were
affected :â€”

1. Whereas in the years 1909-11 pure-bred cultures of ZF. miliaris were the
easiest and quickest of all to rear, in 1912 it was only with great difficulty that the
late larvze of this species could be obtained.

2. It was crosses in which E. miliaris was used as the female parent that showed
the changed inheritance.

3. While in previous years cross-fertilizations with H. miliaris gave uniformly
80 or 90 per cent. segmentation, in 1912 it was rare to obtain as much as 20 per cent.
