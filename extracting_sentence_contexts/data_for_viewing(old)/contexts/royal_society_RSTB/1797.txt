Tsogens ” (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 55).

+ The usual statistical diagrams give us, in one of their axes, the magnitudes of the phenomenon to be
observed (for instance, the life-table, the single years of age), and in the second dimension of the drawing,
the degrees of the scale. In the present case we need both dimensions, namely, the horizontal axis
of the Tabellogram to represent the years of age of the mothers, and the vertical that of the fathers,
so that, in order to make sersible the varying level of natality, we ought to apply a third axis, that is,
we ought to pass from the diagram in the plane to the body of a stereogram constructed in the three
dimensions of space.

It is for such cases that Psrozzo invented his stereograms, and his merit is further raised by the fact
that he used this new method of representation in order to amplify the province of ‘the calculation of
probabilities in general. But as such relief stereograms are not applicable to books, we have to look
for other kinds of graphical designs. Such are, for instance, isobars, isotherms, &c., where all the
places, at the same level of the scale, are connected by a line, and furnish an example how the repre-
sentation of a third dimension becomes possible in statistical diagrams. Such drawings ought to be
classed amongst the “cartograms,” whose basis is supplied by a geographical map. Perrozzo has
adopted this system also for the representation of demographical facts, withont any relation to
their topographical distribution, that is, without referring to a geographical substratum. We arrive
thus, as in the hypsometric maps, at lines of equal height. But such representations do not satisfy

the fundamental requirement of statistical diagrams, that is, to show the change of the facts to the eye
directly, in an immediate way, without appealing to a mental process, for instance, to the view of
