The origin of the superficial layer and of the internal parenchyma of
each emergence is seen to be identical with that demonstrated in my description of
fig. 9, Fig. 8 represents a longitudinal section of a similar petiole, in which these
emergences are again seen at h, h, variously intersected. The above facts combined make it clear that Rachiopteris aspera is merely a petiole
of Lyginodendron Oldhamium ; hence the former name must disappear from our lists. It also follows that Lyginodendron Oldhamium is a true Fern, most probably belonging
to some Sphenopterid type. This determination carries along with it the further one
that the stems of some, at least, of the Ferns of the Carboniferous age developed their
xylem or vascular structures exogenously, through the instrumentality of a meri-
stemic zone of the innermost cortex, which practically must be regarded as a cambium
layer, But the history of this interesting plant is not yet ended.
