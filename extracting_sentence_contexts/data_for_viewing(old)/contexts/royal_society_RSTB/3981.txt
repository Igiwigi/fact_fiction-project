Hb+0, = Hb0,.

(2) That the differences between observed dissociation curves of hemoglobin and
blood can be explained on the assumption that the molecules of hemoglobin can
exist in various states of aggregation.

(3) That the effect of slight changes in reaction is to alter the equilibrium constant
of the reaction, with but little change in the state of assumed aggregation of the

molecules.

Of the two formule which have been put forward to express the facts (those of
J. B. 8. Hanpane and A. V. Hitt) my reasons for preferring that of H1n1 are given
in another place.* It is superfluous to re-argue the point here, rather let me say that
so far as the present investigation goes it is immaterial which formula is used.

The general expression for the curve representing the equilibrium between oxygen
and hemoglobin is, according to H1x1,

Ka"

y/100 = TKS’

where « is the pressure of oxygen, y the percentage saturation of hemoglobin with
