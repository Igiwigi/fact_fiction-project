So that this new frontal cap might almost be regarded as
the cap of Broca. It will further be shown that this region is in all probability the
place where the first expansions of the frontal territory occur in response to the expan-
sions which we have already described in the parietal lobe. The superficial resemblance
then between the frontal cap in the apes—the so-called frontal cap of ANTHONy—and
the frontal cap in man is correlated with the fact that corresponding bony areas of the
skull in the apes do not in man cover homologous areas of brain. The Cast of Sinanthropus Compared with that of Pithecanthropus. Looked at as a whole the essential similarity of these two casts is at once apparent.
