JSQ, for all the experiments at 20° C., we find that the correction to be
applied to the specific heat at this temperature is additive and amounts to 1°3 parts
per 1000. For the experiments at 100° C. the corresponding correction amounts to
3°3 parts per 1000. In the latter case, however, we have the correction mentioned
on p. 214 (lines 7 et seg.), which is subtractive and amounts to 6 parts in 10,000, so
that the two corrections together amount to 2°7 parts per 1000.

(2) A correction for the fact that, in the calibration of the tubes, a linear relation
between PV and 6 was assumed to hold over the range of temperature 0° C. to 17°C.
