(2) Asa result of an emergency stop triggered at a 1 ms~~* nacelle acceleration, the tower top
deflection deviates from the operational deflection and, after a transient, attains a parked
state, where the deflection is due only to wave loads, and wind loads acting on the parked
rotor and along the tower.

(3) If the earthquake occurs in a parked state, the tower top deflection increases starting
from the earthquake strike reducing progressively to the parked deflection. Differences
between 0° and 180° parked states are not notable. It can be argued that, although
the geometry of the two rotor positions is different, the difference in terms of mass
distributions along the height is relatively small, with a consequent relatively small effect
on the seismic response. Note that, once the earthquake has expired, the final parked
deflections in load cases LC2 and LC3 are different, due to the fact that load case LC2 and
load case LC3 involve different wind speeds Vhub, wave periods Tp and significant wave
heights Hs.
