tion of a suspension of lamp-black in gum-arabic solution. In the course of a week in
a cool greenhouse scales began to appear through the film of lamp-black. During the
next few weeks, some of the older primordia situated just outside the apex began to appear
through the black deposit as shining mounds of green tissue. The younger primordia at the
base of the apical cone, i.e. P, to P;, also became evident after some time. But whereas the
actively growing leaf primordia were thrusting aside the lamp-black, no comparable growth
was evident in the axils of the younger primordia. The deposit, in fact, persisted in the axil
until the primordium had receded from the apex; thereafter it became dispersed. An
early dispersal of the lamp-black on the abaxial side of primordia was general. Again,
whereas from an early stage there was evidence of active dispersal of the deposit in the
subapical region immediately adjacent to the base of the apical cone, the apex, except in
the region of P, and P;, still showed a dense deposit. That some growth was taking place, in
the apical cone was, however, indicated by the fact that the black deposit slowly became
broken up into a mosaic-like pattern; with the passage of time a gradual dispersal of the
lamp-black on the apex, from the base upwards, took place. It could then be seen that the
deposit lay farthest down the sides of the cone in the positions of J, and J,. Residual black
areas were also present in interfoliar positions just outside the base of the apical cone. After
several weeks, only a light peppering of lamp-black remained in the region of the apical
cell and this eventually disappeared. Some of these points are illustrated photographically
in figures 47, 48, plate 24. From these preliminary observations it is apparent that there is
a sharp increase in the rate of growth below the apical cone.
