increases largely when the breaking strain has been reached. In any case, however,
the alteration of density which can be produced by longitudinal traction is small, and
in my own experiments never reached } per cent., though several of the wires were
strained to breaking.

WeErTHErM has also obtained similar regults.+

RELATION BETWEEN MoDULI OF ELASTICITY AND INTERMOLECULAR DISTANCE.

If we denote the specific gravity of a 8ubstance by A, and A represent the atomic
weight, the intermolecular distance will be proportional to (3) = UN

Tt is natural to 8uppose that as « diminishes the elasticity will increase, and in fact
WerTHEnM has shownf that is the cage, and moreover that approximately © Youxe's
modulus ” yaries inversely as a,
