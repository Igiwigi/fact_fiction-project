consider the systematic position of the Scutigeride or Cermatide. C. L. Kocu,
in his well-known work, “ System der Myriapoden,” includes this group in an
order by itself, dividing the Myriapods into three orders of equal value. These
orders are the Chilognatha, the Chilopoda, and the Schizotarsia (the Scutigeride).
Larze., on the other hand, and with him most other writers, have included the
Scutigeridze among the Chilopoda, not considering the differences to be of sufficient
value to warrant the formation of a new Order.

TI came to the conclusion that so little was known of the Scutigeride that Latzen
was quite right in including them among the Chilopoda; but that a more careful
study of their organisation might very likely render it necessary to modify that view,
and show that Kocr was right in his establishment of a new Order, although, in the
absence of published facts, his doing so might be premature.

I began my observations on the anatomy of the group by a careful examination of
the respiratory system, being influenced by the circumstance that the existing
accounts differ so much that we may say that the respiration of the group is still
unknown. Larzet, in his book, ‘Die Myriapoden der Oesteireichisch-Ungarischen
Monarchie,’ gives the following account of the respiration of the Scutigerid. ‘“ Die
Art und Weise, wie diese Thiere athmen, ist noch riithselhaft. Zwar lese ich fast
