any Zygophiurid, as we know, the articulation is characterised by a change from a
condition of opisthocoely in the dorsal region to one of procoely below, if we may so

express it. In Onychaster, as we have stated, there are three regions, and these
three merge more or less into one another, owing to the fact that the processes are
local developments of a pair of ridges. In cross-sections there is at one level obvious
similarity to a section of a Zygophiurid vertebra taken through the peg and paired
ventro-lateral sockets, This is in the neighbourhood of the radial canal. It is clear
that if we suppose the radial canal to sink, and its place to fill up with skeletal
tissue, we should then have a posterior knob and paired sockets at its sides, and
correspondingly an anterior pit and paired knobs (compare fig.
