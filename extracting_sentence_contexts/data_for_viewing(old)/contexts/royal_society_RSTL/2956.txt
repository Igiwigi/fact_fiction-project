cannot bear a sudden transition in winter from a high to a low temperature, yet it will
be seen by the Tables at Nos. 116 and 133, that the bees were active when the tem-
perature of the hive was not higher than 43?, that of the atmosphere being 35? Fanm.,
$0 that it is not until the medium in which the bees are residing is below 40?, that
the insects begin to pass into a state of repose.

From a gradually increased teinperature through the months of March and April,
the hive acquires its maximum amount, of temperature in the months of May and
June, the periods of the greatest activity, and when the largest proportion of young
bees is produced. Weare now aware of the circumstances connected with the great
amount of temperature in the hive at this season, and of the power which the
bees themselyes possess of increasing it at pleasure, or as the necessity for im parting
it to the young may demand. These facts will explain a circumstance connected
with the temperatare of the hive, which without a previous knowledge of them might
have been of difficult solation. It is the circumstance before alluded to of one part
of the hive being of a higher temperature than another. This is the case in the hive
even when the bees are not in a state of excitement. TI had been led to the observa-
tion of this fact during the winter when making experiments on the bees in a state
of excitement. Being anxious to know whether this was also the case in the spring
and 8ummer, I introduced another thermometer through the top of the straw hive, at
the same distance from the centre, but on the side opposite to the one previously in-
serted. This was on the evening of the 12th of May, when the temperature of the
atmosphere was 58* Fanun. The instrument on passing through the top of the hive
was plunged into a cell of honey, and the mercury rose to 78* Fanr., which of course
indicated the real temperature at that time of the honey and interior of the hive.
