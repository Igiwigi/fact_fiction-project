Fig. 2 of Plate 23 shows the deformed marble, freed in this way from the tube
shown in fig. 1 of the same plate, and beside it a marble column of the dimensions
which it originally possessed, for purposes of comparison.

The deformed marble is uniform and compact, and seems to break with equal ease

in all directions. It differs somewhat in appearance from the original rock in possess-
ing a dead white colour, somewhat like chalk, the glistening cleavage surfaces of the
calcite being no longer visible, and the difference being well brought out in certain
cases owing to the fact that a certain portion of the original marble often remains
unaltered and unaffected by the pressure. This, when present, has the form of two
cones of obtuse angle, whose bases are the original ends of the column resting against
the faces of the steel plugs, while the apices extend into the mass of the deformed
marble and point toward one another. These cones, or rather parabolas of rotation,
are developed, as is well known, in all cases where cubes of rock, Portland cement, or
cast iron are crushed in a testing machine in the ordinary manner. In the present
experiments they seldom constituted any large proportion of the whole mass, and in
some cases are absent or but faintly indicated, but there is always in immediate con-
tact with the ends of the steel plugs a thin cake at least of marble possessing the
characters of the original rock.

In order to ascertain the strength of the deformed rock as compared with the
