And it is what happens, though at a point much less remote, in the
calcification of a mammalian ameloblast, which undergoes calcification at its distal
extremity, these cells being themselves yet further separated from the vessels by the
interposition of the cells of the stratum intermedium and of the external epithelium
of the enamel organ,

42 MR. C. 8S. TOMES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE

To revert to the rods or tubes which have been described and figured (figs. 5, 8), it
seems hardly possible to doubt that they bear some relation to the forming prisms, and
are a stage in their development, and the fact that they are not to be distinguished in
that portion of the enamel stroma which lies close to the dentine tends to bear out
this view. For it is to be remembered that the marked striation of the finished
enamel, whether it be due to tubes or to very distinct prisms, does not exist in the
inner portions which lie close to the dentine; this may be better seen in the thick
enamel of Sargus than in the comparatively scanty enamel of the Gadidw, though
it is true of both alike. But whether the appearances figured are sections of solid rods or of tubes remains
uncertain.
