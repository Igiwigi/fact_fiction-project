layer is only partially de-stained. When, however, such a slide is obtained, it is seen
that nearly all the still visible spherules are as large and as deeply stained as in less
extracted slides, though present in far fewer numbers. Only here and there will a
spherule have been caught in the act of de-staining, and then it is seen that, even in
the case of the individual spherule, there is no gradual transition from an unstained
to a deeply stained condition, for a part of the spherule still remains as deeply stained
as before, while the rest—usually one side or the periphery, rarely the centre—is
already completely de-stained. There is no evidence, in the de-staining of the
peripheral layer during differentiation, that the more or less peripheral position of the
spherules in any way influences the ease with which they part with the basic stain.

That the behaviour of the peripheral spherules is not due merely to their peripheral
position is also indicated by the fact that in the adult egg they are never so closely
crowded as to totally exclude the ordinary yolk spherules from this region, ordinary
yolk spherules occurring among the peripheral spherules right up to the inner surface
of the vitelline membrane.

It is, therefore, clear, from a study of the evidence afforded by the adult egg alone,
that the peculiar behaviour of the peripheral layer of spherules is not of the nature of
a fixation artifact, nor in any way due to the peripheral position which they occupy.
It is, instead, evident that they must differ considerably in constitution from the yolk
spherules. Nor is there any evidence that a conversion of the one into the other is
taking place ; a conclusion fully in harmony with the fact that the number of the
peripheral spherules remains fairly constant, not only during the closing period of yolk
formation, but also after the completion of this process for as long as the egg remains
