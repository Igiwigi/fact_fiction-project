the southern sky was fully covered with cumulus and cumulo-nimbus clouds right up
to the horizon, but the northern sky, particularly near the horizon, was mostly clear.
Thunder was heard for about an hour, beginning from 14 hrs., at long intervals, but
no lightning was observed. During the passage of the cloud it was apparently ramming
10 or 15 miles south of the station, but no rainfall was recorded at the station.

The electrogram and the associated meteorograms obtained during the passage of
the above-mentioned thundercloud have been reproduced in fig. 8 (Plate 4).

In the first few records obtained with the photographic electrograph the time increased
from right to left. The electrogram given in fig. 8 is one of those. The meteorograms
have also consequently been plotted with the time increasing from right to left. This
fact should be borne in mind when comparing this record with the other records in
this paper.

During the passage overhead of the northern fringe of the thundercloud the electro-
gram showed two distinct changes. When the front part of the fringe came overhead
the field became strongly negative, but the intensity of the field was only a small fraction
of that attained in those cases in which the centres of the clouds passed overhead.
During the passage of the rear part of the fringe the field became highly positive, but
here, too, the intensity was much smaller than that attained in the case of thunderclouds
whose centres passed overhead. This is exactly what one would expect, for im this
case the fringe only, in which the density of charge was a small fraction of that in the
most active region, passed over the station. The field changed from negative to positive
with great suddenness, suggesting that there was a sharp transition between the regions
