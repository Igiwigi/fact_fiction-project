continua. Hilbert thought it convenient to go in the opposite direction also, i.e. to derive the laws
of motions of rigid bodies by limiting processes, starting from a system of axioms that describe
space as filled with continuous matter in varying conditions. Thus, one could investigate the
equivalence of different systems of axioms, an investigation that Hilbert considered to be of the
highest theoretical importance.

This is one of the few places where Hilbert emphasized Boltzmann’s work over Hertz’s in

this regard, and this may give us the clue to the most immediate trigger that was in the back : =
of Hilbert’s mind when he decided to include this problem in the list. Indeed, Hilbert had met : S
Boltzmann several months earlier in Munich, where the latter gave a talk on recent developments 2
in physics. Boltzmann had not only discussed ideas connected with the task that Hilbert was now aed
calling for but also adopted a rhetoric that seems to have appealed very much to Hilbert. In fact, 22
Boltzmann had suggested that one could follow up the recent history of physics with a look at [4
future developments. Nevertheless, he said, ‘I will not be so rash as to lift the veil that conceals the : >
future’ [32, p. 79]. Hilbert, on the contrary, opened the lecture by asking precisely, ‘who among us : =
would not be glad to lift the veil behind which the future lies hidden’ and the whole trust of his i8

talk implied that he, the optimistic Hilbert, was helping the mathematical community to do so.

Together with the well-known works on mechanics referred to above, Hilbert also mentioned
a recent work by the Gottingen actuarial mathematician Georg Bohlmann on the foundations
of the calculus of probabilities [33]. The latter was important for physics, Hilbert said, for its
application to the method of mean values and to the kinetic theory of gases. Hilbert’s inclusion
of the theory of probabilities among the main physical theories whose axiomatization should be
