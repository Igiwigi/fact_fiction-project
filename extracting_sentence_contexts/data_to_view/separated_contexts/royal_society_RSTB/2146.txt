The suppression may be permanent
or temporary, An anesthetised like a dead eyeball tested by single currents manifests
only polarisation effects negative in direction to the exciting currents. Tetanisation
then gives only polarisation effect in the direction of the break shocks, negative to the
direction of the make shocks. EXCITED BY LIGHT AND EXCITED ELECTRICALLY. 163

As regards inferences from the facts, and the theoretical signification of the latter,
Tam very unwilling to commit myself too absolutely to any theoretical conclusions. T believe it to be proved by these observations that the retina is the seat of a double
electrical movement, a simultaneous positive and negative effect, but whether this
double effect is the expression of duplex change in one substance, or of two changes
in two different components, cannot be strictly demonstrated, and must remain matter
of opinion. Iam of the opinion that we have to do with a duplex change, construc-
tive and disruptive, in one substance.
