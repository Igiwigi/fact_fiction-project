Therefore, all three top-per-
forming algorithms employ a strategy for pruning indirect
links. On the other hand, being able to detect only linear
relationships does not impact performance strongly. This is
indicated by the fact that partial correlation is among the
best-performing algorithms and that Pearson correlation
and mutual information attain a similar average rank. We
concluded that reconstruction success of an algorithm is
determined more by the pruning strategy used than by
which measure is used to score co-expression patterns. Somewhat surprisingly, the two implementations for par-
tial correlation performed very differently, with the pls
implementation ranking top, although this implementation
has been shown to have the highest error for estimating the
partial correlation matrix on synthetic data [18].
