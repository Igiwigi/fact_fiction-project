rounded boulders and alluvium. Across it a number of small streams make their way
northwards to join the Nalingkwa river, but they are not the only agency by which the
plain has been disturbed. A number of low mounds are seen to rise a few feet above its
general level, and it is probable that they all owe their origin to late Middle Pleistocene
movements, for about a mile and a half north of the east-west Lokitoi scarp, one of
these mounds has been partially eroded revealing the section shown in fig. 10 and
fig. 27, Plate 29. It could be clearly seen that pressure had caused the boulders of the
Valley floor to be caught up with the underlying yellow tuffs in a series of small folds
accompanied by minor thrust faults. The axes of both folds and faults run in a general
north-south direction. The yellow tuffs may: perhaps be the down-faulted continuation
of the tuffs on which the fossil trees were growing south of Lokitoi, but no remains
were found in them at this point. I believe the age of these movements to be late
Middle Pleistocene on account of the fact that Levallois artifacts having a similar
patination to the boulders of the Valley floor were found lying upon the surface.
Though this is admittedly weak evidence, it is supported by the very existence of these
mounds, which being formed of such easily eroded material as they are, would surely
have been completely removed by erosion were they of much earlier origin.
