In the case of the Lepidodendrex, for example, there can, we think, be no
8 doubt that an unprejudiced consideration of their vegetative structure alone is
 saficiont to lead to a true estimate of their relationships, which is only confirmed by
8 our knowledge of their fructifications. So also with the Calamariesw ; as we showed
4 in a former paper, * a minute examination of the anatomical characters, especially
£ © those of the primary tissues, affords by itself the strongest presumption of Equi-
% setaceous affinities, and so helps us to the right interpretation of the evidence from
= the fructifications. i
5 A really accurate knowledge of vegetative characters, especially of those derived
© from the internal structure, may, we believe, be trusted to put us on to the right
B track i in cases where the larger systematic groups are alone in question. EB The fact that in various respects both Lyginodendron and Heterangium strongly
E resemble Ferns has been noticed since the first discovery of these plants, and has been
Q demonstrated in the preceding pages. As regards the former genus, we have now
proved beyond doubt that the highly compound leaves were those of a Sphenopteris,
and in Heterangium the general character of the foliage was evidently similar. The
external form and even the venation of the leaf, however, would by themselves carry
_ ho decisive weight, though hundreds of fossil species have been referred to the Ferns
on no better grounds.
