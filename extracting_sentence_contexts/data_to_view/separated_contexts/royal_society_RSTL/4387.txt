6. Although the warm-blooded animals are in great degree removed, by the inde-
pendent calorifying power which they possess, from the influence of external tempe-
rature, yet it is very easily shown that their vital activity is no less under the direct
and immediate influence of heat, than is that of cold-blooded animals. In fact, it
would seem to be for the sake of keeping up their vital energy to a certain high and
uniform rate, that they are endowed with the heat-generating power; and if this
power be not exercised, and the body be cooled down, its vital activity is reduced,
and at last extinguished. From the experiments of CyossaTÂ®* it appears that Birds
and Mammals cannot (except in the case of the hybernating species) be cooled down
more than 30* below their natural standard, without the entire suspension of their
animal and organic functions. This depression of temperature consequent upon pro-
longed starvation, was found to take place as s0on as all the fat and other disposable
materials in the body had been burned off.
