Recall that a is invertible if and only if 0 ¢ o(a). In light
of theorem 4.4, we know that for any c € R (with c #1) and with a=4a,, as usual, o(a¢)
coincides with the closure of the range of ¢ = ¢(s) along the vertical line {Re(s) = c}. Now,
according to a result of GarunkStis & Steuding in [113] concerning the non-universality of
¢ in the left critical strip {0 < Re(s) < ah we know that, conditionally (i.e. under the RH),
we have that, for all c € (0, 3),0(a) (that is, the closure of the range of ¢ on {Re(s) =c}) isa
strict subset of C and, in fact, that 0 ¢ o(a); see [113, lemma 4 and proposition 5] and their
proofs. Hence, a is invertible. Conversely, assume that a = a¢ is invertible (i.e. 0 ¢ o(a)) for every c € (0, 3).
