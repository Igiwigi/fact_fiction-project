There is every reason to believe that, although the decomposition is difficult bo: regulate,
this same body is formed by the simple application of heat to the substance without the
intervention of the naphtha. The result of one experiment, in which the graphic acid
had been carefully heated in an air-bath to 280® until it ceased to lose weight, gave to
analysis—carbon 80-36, hydrogen 0-71. In other experiments numbers approximating
to these were obtained.

We have not the data to determine with certainty the precise mode of the formation
of this body. The simplest hypothesis which coincides with the ascertained facts, is
that 7 equivalents of the graphic acid give by their decomposition 6 of the new body.
We have 7(C,, H, O,)=1512 and 3(C,, H, O,)=990 and 1512 : 990: : 100: 65:48, 69:48
being the amount of residue found.

On this view it would be possible to form the new substance by the elimination of
water, carbonic acid, and carbonic oxide from the original body, according to the equation

7(C,, H, O,)=3(C,, H, 0,)+6H,0+6CO,+5CO.

The slight excess of carbon in the last series of analyses indicates the presence of 80me
compound containing a higher per-centage of carbon. It will be rendered evident, by
the following experiments, that we have only to heat this s8wbstance under slightly
