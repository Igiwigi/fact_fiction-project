ontogeny would be conelusive on this matter, and we trust that some of the anatomists
+ who have the opportunity of studying the development of the Sturgeon will 800n leb us
know the facts of the case. Tf there are persisting funnels of the mesonephric segmental
tubes in adult Sturgeons, some of them ought to be situated within the genital ducts,
if the latter are not Miillerian ducts ; and naturalists who have the opportunity ought
:Salso to look out for such openings. ,
Z The mode of origin of the anterior part of the genital duct of Lepidosters appears to
Sus to tell strongly in favour of the view, already regarded as probable by one of us,*
'Sthat the Teleostean genital ducts are derived from those of Ganoids ; and if, as appears
Bto us indubitable, the most primitive type of Ganoid genital ducts is found in the
= Chondrostei, it is interesting to notice that the remaining Ganoids present in various
2 ways approximations to the arrangement typically found in Teleostei. Lepidosteus
Zobviously approaches Teleostei in the fact of the ovarian ridge forming part of the
Ewall of the oviduct, but differs from the Teleostei in the fact of the oviduet opening
Z into the kidney ducts, instead of each pair of ducts having an independent opening in
the cloaca, and in the fact that the male genital products are not carried to the
Dexterior by a duct homologous with the oviduct. Amia is closer to the Teleostei in
Ãž the arrangement of the posterior part of the genital ducts, in that the two genital
E ducts coalesce posteriorly; while Polypterus approaches still nearer to the Teleostei in
& the fact, that the two genital duets and the two kidney ducts unite with each other

before they join; and in order to convert this arrangement into that characteristic of

the Teleostei we have only to conceive the coalesced ducts of the kidneys acquiring
