him, according to this method, to investigate the history of any representative initial
disturbance. He argued that the supplementary solution is required to neutralise at
the boundaries the values of ) and éy/éy which are given by the primary solution (19) ;
and that, since the latter inevitably comes to zero when ¢ is very large (the time factor is
ultimately governed by the term e~#***), the supplementary solution must also come
to zero. Hence he concluded that the steady motion is stable.

8. Commenting on this argument, Orr remarks* : “
held that neither does it afford a proof of the stability of the motion.” Orr argues
that the supplementary solution is completely determined by the necessity of neutralising
at the boundaries the values of ¥ and d¥/éy as given by (19); and that Kenvin has
assumed without justification that it consequently starts from zero at t= 0. If the
supplementary solution is in fact to start from zero, solutions of the type (19) must not
only satisfy both boundary conditions initially, but also be capable of representing any
arbitrary initial disturbance.

Later Orr objects to KeLvin’s assumption, that the supplementary solution will
come asymptotically to zero as ¢ increases to infinity because this is true of the primary
solution (19). He says} that this can be asserted only of the bowndary values of the
supplementary solution ; and he concludes that “ Lord Kevin has not proved stability,
even for infinitesimal disturbances.’{ He gives examples to show that Kenvin’s
assumptions will be justified only if it is known that the fundamental free disturbances
are stable,—and this, of course, is the question at issue.

It would seem that a slight modification of Kwtvrn’s analysis enables us to meet
