Venus, made in Sweden, and, among theſe, that of
Monſ. Planman, made at Cajanebourg. Since that
time, ſome new obſervations have ſhewn, that the
difference of meridians between Stockholm and Ca-
janebourg is only 38' 40” to 45”, that is, half a
minute leſs than | preſumed then. This correQion
has convinced Monſ. Planman, that, in his obſerva-
tion on the interior conta&t of the limbs of Venus
and the ſun, there has happened an error of a minute;
not through the fault of the obſerver, but that of his
afliſtant, who counted the ſeconds at the clock : fo
that, inſtead of 10 8' 58”, it ſhould be 10b 7 58”,
I think it extremely probable, that this is the fact;
for, upon this correction, all the obſervations of Mon,
Planman agree very well with each other, and with
thoſe of the other aſtronomers,
