BARIUM. The next metal experimented on was barium, an element of much lower atomic weight
than lead, and in this respect, occupying a position not very much above the mean atomic
weight of the elements. It was s00n found that the facts obseryed with lead did not
completely hold with regard to barium, although they include the phenomena presented
by the chloride, bromide, and iodide. Even with these salts, however, the phenomena,
though the same in kind, differ 80mewhat in degree. For instance, the same number of
metallic lines was observed in all these salts, and between the appearance of the chloride
and the bromide spectrum there was no appreciable difference.
