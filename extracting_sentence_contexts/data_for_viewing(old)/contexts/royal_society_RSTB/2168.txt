was given by the writer of various experiments bearing on the nature of Leguminous
nodules and the organisms concerned in their formation. The work, there described,
had reference almost exclusively to the nodules borne by Piswm sativum and Vicia
hirsuta, but it is now proposed to record some further results obtained from a more
comparative study of nodules from other genera of the Leguminosw, and, in addition,
to discuss, in some detail, subsequent experiments upon the nodule organisms, both
in connection with their behaviour on artificial media, and the effect of their action
upon the host plants, and, in conclusion, to consider these experiments in relation to
the intimate connection, which they suggest as existing, between the host plants and
their parasitic organisms on the one hand, and the very varied and complicated
physical and biological factors of the environment on the other hand.

As regards anatomical characters, the facts to hand are still not sufficiently
comprehensive to admit of any general conclusions being drawn as to the relation of
the nodules borne by the genera of the different sub-orders of the Leguminose ; it will,
therefore, be convenient to consider each genus separately, irrespective of its systematic
position in the order. :

In the study of the nodules of Phaseolus (P. multiflorus and P. oleraceus) it is
noticeable that the formation of nodules in this genus appears to require a greater
length of time than in the majority of our common leguminous crops. For instance,
in ordinary garden soil, Phaseolus plants have been grown for at least three weeks
without a trace of nodules appearing upon the roots, whilst on peas, vetches, clovers,
&c., they are as a rule easily detected after about ten days.
