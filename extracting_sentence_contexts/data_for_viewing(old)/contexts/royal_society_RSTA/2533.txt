The RUM model provides some insight into the nature of the atomic structures of high-
symmetry phases. Perhaps the clearest example is that of B-cristobalite [26,27]. Its crystal structure
can be described as having a diamond arrangement of Si atoms with O atoms lying half-
way between the shortest Si-Si vectors. In crystal structure refinements, the anisotropic atomic
displacement parameters show large motions of the O atoms perpendicular to the linear Si-O-Si
linkages [28], suggesting that there is a strong tendency to bend the Si-O-Si angles away from
180Â° whilst preserving the Si-O distance. To reproduce this effect, it is also possible to refine
the crystal structure with 6 (say) positions of the O atoms displaced away from the Si-Si vector
with partial occupancy. It has, therefore, been proposed that the atomic structure is disordered.
One popular idea is that the apparent cubic crystal structure emerges as an average of small
domains of a lower-symmetry structure. Analysis from measurement and calculation of the pair
distribution function has shown that in fact a domain model is inappropriate [29], and that instead
the apparent disorder in the atomic structure emerges from the superposition of many RUMs with
different wave vectors [26,27]. These RUMs have relatively high amplitude owing to their low


frequency: the square of the amplitude is proportional to the T/#*, where T is the temperature
and w is the angular frequency of the phonon. This situation is actually quite different from
the case of disorder in a spin model. A similar picture has been found to apply in the case of
A-quartz [27,30,31]. In the case of displacive phase transitions in perovskites such as SrTiO3, where
RUMs only exist along lines in reciprocal space rather than on planes, there is much less apparent
disorder as seen in analysis of the pair distribution function [32].
