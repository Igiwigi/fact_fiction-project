have their equivalent in steady motions, but an infinitesimal amount of rotation
would’ immediately convert such steady motions into oscillatory motions of very
long period.

For the particular case s = 0 the roots of the second class are all zero even
when the angular velocity of rotation is finite. Hence steady motions can exist
on a rotating globe, but these are necessarily of zonal type. We have in fact

already seen in Part I.* that the only forms of steady motion which can exist are of
this character, and have explained the fact by stating that the steady motions not
of zonal type which can exist on a globe without rotation must have their analogue
in the more general case in oscillatory motions whose period bears a finite ratio to
the rotation-period, no matter how great the latter may be. Our present work
confirms this statement and throws further light on the nature of these oscillatory

motions.

§ 9. Evaluation of the Earlier Roots.

The errors resulting from the use of the approximate formule of the last section
may be considerable in the case of the earlier roots for which » has small values.
To obtain these earlier roots we must therefore proceed by trial and error, the
