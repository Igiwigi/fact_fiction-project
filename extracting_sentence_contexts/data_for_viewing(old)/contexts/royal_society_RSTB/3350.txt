Possible Source of the Magnesium.—We have mentioned above (p. 194) that
there is evidence of marine conditions at once succeeding the deposition of the coal
in which true coal balls are found, and the case described where they occur in the
Gannister Seam (p. 188) seems very clear evidence that the sea water is of
importance in their formation. As is well known, magnesium is largely found in a
soluble form in nature, yet the formation of numerous coal balls with as much as
40 per cent. magnesium carbonate, and huge masses of dolomite, as at the Wirral
Colliery, shows that the source must have been sufficient to supply large quantities
while these structures were forming.

In the Sea Water.—The conditions under which the balls were formed, in large
areas of undisturbed coal, negative the possibility of dolomite or magnesium springs.
Tn fact, without further preamble, we may state that we look to the sea water itself
as the source of both calcium and magnesium in a soluble form. That sea water was
there, and in large quantities, we know from the presence of the many marine shells
immediately above the coal; that it must have penetrated and completely saturated
the coal-forming masses of plants is inevitable, from their soft pulpy condition.
That sea water contains a certain percentage of calcium and magnesium sulphates
in solution is well known, The analysis quoted is the average resulting from a
large number, and is taken from the “Challenger” Reports (see Dirrmar ('84),
p. 204).
