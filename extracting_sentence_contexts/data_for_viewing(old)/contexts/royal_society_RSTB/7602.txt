to the hole in which the cigarette was originally inserted. Again the cigarette is placed
in the small hole, and the pipe is drawn from the end hole. This time smoke is intended
to be used, so the cigarette is removed from the small hole, and the smoker applying

pipe filled with smoke], but this time the smoker does not inhale the charge himself,
but removes the cigarette and politely hands the charged pipe to his neighbour, who
punctiliously rubs the mouthpiece, and enjoys the long whiff. Very often there is one
drawer for an entire party, whose duty it is to fill the pipe with smoke, and pass it so
filled to each of his companions in turn.

giddy; and they are not infrequently seized with severe fits of coughing when the fumes
have proved particularly suffocating. The supply of tobacco is carried in the armlet or
behind the ear.’

full of dirt and black from smoke, which gives the appearance of having been engraved
