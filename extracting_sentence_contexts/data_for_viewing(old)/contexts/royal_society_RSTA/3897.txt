The identified Young’s modulus is shown in figure 6a. What can be observed is that even
with low variance of added white noise the identification procedure exhibits substantial temporal
oscillations. During the first 20 us, it seems to be impossible to identify the correct value of Young’s
modulus, whereas during the final 80s, the mean identified Young’s modulus is 77.91 GPa,
but still exhibiting noteworthy temporal fluctuations. Figure 6b shows the reconstructed stress—
strain response averaged over the entire region of interest from the beginning to the end of


the simulation. Again, certain oscillation can be observed, however less pronounced than in
the identified Young’s modulus. Additionally, a linear response is observed with the stress-
strain response, and the value of the Young’s modulus obtained from linear regression of the
reconstructed stress-strain curve is 77.35 GPa. Finally, it seems that the identification procedure
exhibits high sensitivity to noisy displacements. However, this was expected due to the fact that
the noise present in the displacement maps affects both strain and acceleration fields.

(iii) Effect of measurement temporal resolution

Dynamic tensile fracturing of concrete is closely related to the nucleation and propagation
of cracks associated with unstable crack growth [66]. Additionally, dynamic tensile fracturing
increases the crack speed under dynamic loadings to about 0.20-0.30 of the Rayleigh wave
speed [67,68]. This increased crack propagation speed of one or several tensile cracks results
in a failure process that lasts only a few microseconds and also makes it difficult to obtain a
sufficient number of measurement points. As in this experimental procedure it is also required to
reconstruct the acceleration maps from the displacement fields, the images have to be grabbed
at very low interframe times, of the order of not more than a few microseconds, which are
