However, the skin patterns of fish and amphibians can often be regenerated in
adults, and disrupting the pattern does not affect the survival of the individual [2]. Furthermore,


dynamic changes in patterns can be observed without experimental manipulation. In fact, it was
the change in the pattern of the emperor angelfish that first alerted experimental biologists to the
existence of Turing’s principle in living organisms [11]. As for the discovery of detailed molecular
principles, one of the earliest was the skin pattern of the zebrafish to which many molecular
genetic technologies can be applied. [12-15]

Today, Turing’s principle is accepted by many experimental researchers and is used to analyse
many morphogenetic phenomena [2,3]. The recent discovery that the number of fingers in
mice is determined by Turing waves has made it clear that Turing’s principle is involved in
the formation of important structures in living organisms and has increased interest in the
theory [3,16].
