II. By increasing the temperature, we expand Hy first towards both ends of the spec-
trum, then HP, He remaining almost unchanged after Hy has passed into an undeter-
mined large violet band.

TI. By increasing the tenuity, He disappears first, H3 remaining well defined, and
moreover the colour of the ignited gas changes to the eye.

IV. Under certain conditions, which are not stated in the memoir, new lines appear
in the spectrum, especially in the neighbourhood of the sodium-line.

As8uming that hydrogen gas is present in the chromosphere and prominences, we
have the following facts to place side by ide with those just stated :â€”

IL. In place of the three lines we haye but He and HP.

1. HP is in process of expansion, the expansion increasing as the sun is approached,
and Hy is 80 far expanded that it no longer exists as a line; most careful obseryations
