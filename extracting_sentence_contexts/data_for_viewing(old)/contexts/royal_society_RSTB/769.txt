between the species in the vertebral formula.

I have found caudal intercentra in one skeleton only (A. australis) : they have the
form of irregular nodules of bone (fig. 206, int.cent.), one between the pygostyle and
the preceding (ninth) caudal vertebra, the other between the eighth and ninth.

The general rule appears to be, as Mivarr states, that uncinates are present on the
cervico-thoracic and on the first six thoracic ribs, but the short cervico-thoracic ribs of
the skeleton of A. australis referred to above (p. 83) are devoid of those appendages,
which are also absent on one side in another skeleton examined. OweEN also states
that they are absent in the specimen first examined by him. The occasional absence
of the cervico-thoracic uncinates, taken in connection with the vestigial condition of
the ribs in one case, and with the fact that in the same skeleton the first thoracic rib
of the right side terminates ventrad in a blunt free end and has no sternal portion,
seems to point to an inclusion of anterior thoracic vertebrae in the cervical region by
atrophy of their ribs.

The descriptions of the sternum by Owen (24, p. 34) and by my Father (43,
p. 191)—the only two detailed accounts I have met with—give all the essential
features of the bone, and at the same time serve to show its great variability. In
Owen’s specimen (A. australis) the posterior lateral processes are slightly longer than
