There is then a 0.494 probability that the process will return to the central states Syj and Sy; on
emission of either an / or an r. If not, then another e is observed. Thus, even though pairs of e’s
(ee) are unlikely (and, in fact, prohibited in this e-machine) the probability of observing two e’s
separated by a single r or / is surprisingly large. It appears that they ‘clump’ into small regions. Often one examines the causal architecture for hints of what kinds of faults might be present. :
But since the most visited states (S,j and Sy;) do not represent a cycle, there is no parent crystal [=
here.
