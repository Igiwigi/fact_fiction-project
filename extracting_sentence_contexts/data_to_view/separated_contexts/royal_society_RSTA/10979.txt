has in fact used the rate of fall of the drops, formed on the ions as the result of
expansion, to determine the number of the ions present, from which he obtains an
estimate of the charge carried by each. The results of measurements with this double apparatus are given in the tables
which follow. After what has already been said in connection with the other
apparatus, it is hardly necessary to point out that, when the right-hand plate is
connected to the positive terminal of the battery, and the left-hand plate to the
negative terminal (the central plate being at zero potential), there will be a great
excess of negative ions on the right, and of positive ions on the left.
