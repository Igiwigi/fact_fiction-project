5 A final word completes this subject. I attempt. to explain the rotation of the
vo . . 2 . . a .
‘3 axis by assuming the passage of the excitation wave along the Purkinje paths of
— septum, apex and lateral wall in that order. As a matter of fact, however, the
e plane of our contacts has not the relation to the heart shown in fig. 5. Here the
— . . .
% plane of section is at right angles to the septum; this plane in the dog makes with
£ the coronal plane an angle of some 45-50°. In other words, the plane of the septum
gE itself is not antero-posterior in the body, but is inclined to it, being approximately
3 midway between the sagittal and coronal planes. Nevertheless, the electro-
3 cardiograms taken in the coronal plane clearly bear the impress of events in this
S : Te ; : =
S mid-plane. If, while the chest wall is closed, we take two series of curves, the
E contacts being in the one instance in the coronal plane (Table V, coronal), and in the

a other instance being in a plane at right angles to the septum (Table V, rotated), the
