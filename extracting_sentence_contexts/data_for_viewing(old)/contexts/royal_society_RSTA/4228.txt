state’ itself (MFQM, p. 350).
Krylov’s primary complaint with von Neumann (pp. 184-85) is the multiplicity of valid
decompositions of mixed-state density operators.

Firstly, in using the statistical operator, we assume the selection of a certain orthogonal
system of coordinates in the subspace delimited by an inexhaustively complete experiment
and we also assume a certain choice of weights 7. [...] A change in the orthogonal system
means, generally speaking, a transition to another physical state described by the statistical
operator, to what is said to be another statistical aggregate. (‘A state’ is understood here in
a more general sense than a state exhaustively completely determined, using a Y-function.)
[...] Therefore, the selection of a certain orthogonal system of functions and the fixing
of certain weights w;, which the von Neumann operator presupposes, amounts to the
introduction of some physically fictitious properties of the reality being described.

That is, Krylov finds the conjunction of the following two statements unacceptable:

— A pure quantum state is a physical property of a system.
— The quantum formalism implies that a mixed-state statistical operator has multiple
decompositions into linear combinations of pure states.

Krylov insists upon the former and therefore finds the latter unsatisfactory. As we discussed
earlier, QBists (and some other varieties of Quantum Bayesians) agree that these two statements
clash with each other, but discard the first instead. Von Neumann holds onto both (MFQM, SIV.3).
