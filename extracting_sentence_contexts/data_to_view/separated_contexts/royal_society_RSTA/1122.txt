The almost-everywhere
uniqueness follows relatively easily.)

8. Conclusion

We end with a quick summary of the above discussion. The key fact to take away is that
proving the uniqueness of solutions depends upon being able to show that they are sufficiently
smooth. There is, therefore, a natural hierarchy of solutions, whose properties improve with their
regularity.

— Very weak solutions are not unique.

— Weak (finite-energy) solutions may not be unique, but exist for all time. They enjoy various
‘partial regularity’ properties, which are, for example, sufficient to show that ‘particle
paths’ exist for almost all initial conditions, so that a Lagrangian approach is valid even
for weak solutions.
