be half as large again as they are found to be.

Hence no section of the surface of wave slowness on FRESNEL'S theory can agree
with the results of the experiments. We may remark, in addition, that the differences
between consecutive values of p for the onter sheeb given by he eg are about
double those given by theory. |

After this investigation it 8eems needless to discuss possible alterations in the posi- |
tion of the plane of the second prism, with a view to bringing the results of experi-
ment more nearly into accordance with theory. While as regards the constants a, b, e,
it has already been seen that they have received their most probable values.

Thus our results, 80 far as they go, point to the fact that FresxeL's construetion {
does not represent Nature, and that some other theory musb be sought to explain the
phenomena of double refraction. |

And as regards the rival theories already proposed, Lord RavLEGn's, we have 8een,
is even more than FResxBr/s at variance with observed appearances, while I can hardly
think that sufficient data have yet been collected to repay the labour of comparison
with the theories of Gree and Cavcay, for on account of the undetermined constants
it would be necessary to force theory and experiment to agree in 80 many points that
they must, perforce, almost agree exactly along the small arcs investigated.
