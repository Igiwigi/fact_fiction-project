Geographical, Bathymetrical, and Geological distribution.

So far as is at present known, Orbitolites tenuissima inhabits only the North
Atlantic Ocean and the seas in communication with it. The firsb complete specimens
were obtained in the © Porcupine ” dredgings of 1869, at depths of from 630 to 1,443
fathoms, between the north-west of Ireland and Rockall Bank. In the © Porcupine ”
expedition of 1870, however, it was brought up from a bottom of only 64 fathoms in
Setubal Bay, on the coast of Portugal, and afterwards from a shallow bottom within
the Mediterranean, near Carthagena. That it is an inhabitant of other parts of the
Mediterranean I then inferred from the fact that I had detected fragments of it in
the Foraminiferal dredgings, made at 250 fathoms by EpwarD ForBrs and Lieut.
(now Admiral) SpraTrT in the Mgean, in 1842; and it is stated by Dr. J. Gwys
JEFFREYS, in his © Report on the Biology of the © Valorous ' Cruise,” that it has been
dredged by the Marquis pu MoxTeRosaTo at from 100 to 200 fathoms' depth, off
the coast of Sicily. That it might extend far to the north, would be expected from
its capability of bearing the low temperature of 37* Fahr., which prevails over the
deep bottom from which it was first brought up ; and this expectation was verified by
its presenting itself in one of the © Valorous” dredgings in Baffin's Bay (lat. 62* 6' N.,
depth 1,350 fathoms, temperature 34* 6' Fahr.), as well as at two stations in the
North Atlantic, No. 12, depth 1,450 fathoms, and No. 13, depth 690 fathoms, both in the
parallel of 56*%, It has been only once brought up, however, in the © Challenger ”
expedition, viz., at Station 44, off Cape Hatteras, from a bottom of 1,700 fathoms'
