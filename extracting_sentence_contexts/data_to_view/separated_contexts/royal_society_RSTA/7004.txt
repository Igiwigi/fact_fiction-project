It is important to note that these results indicate that a lubricant which behaves well at room
temperatures (that is, which gives smooth sliding) may have poor boundary lubricating properties at
quite moderate temperatures of the running parts. Experiments have also been carried out with pure fatty acids and similar effects have been observed,
though the temperature at which stick-slips commence is appreciably higher than the values given
above and increases with the chain length of the acid. The temperature at which this reversible effect
occurs is in fact a characteristic of the particular oil used and, as Tabor has suggested, it probably
provides a measure of the strength with which the lubricant film adheres to the metal surface; the
higher the transition temperature, the more strongly is the film adsorbed on the surface. It would thus
be possible by such means to compare different lubricants in this respect. This opens up a new field of
investigation.

} A preliminary investigation of the detailed physical processes that occur during the sliding of
rigidly-held lubricated metallic surfaces has recently been carried out using a cathode ray oscillograph.
