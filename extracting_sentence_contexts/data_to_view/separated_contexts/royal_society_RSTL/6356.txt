made 120 revolutions in 52" : the diameter of the
fails being 3 fect 6 inches, the velocity of their ex-
tremities will be 25,4 feet in a ſecond; but the velo-
city of the wind producing it, being 6 feet in the
fame time, we ſhall have 6: 25,4::1: 442 ; in this
caſe therefore, the velocity of their extremities was
4,2 times greater, than that of the wind. In like
manner, the relative velocity of the wind, to the ex-
tremities of the ſame fails, when loaded to a maxi-
mum, making then 93 turns in 52”, will be found to
be - 1:3,3; or 3,3 times quicker than that of the
wind,

It appears from the preceding colleQtion of ex«
amples, that when' the extremities of the Duzch fails
are parallel to the plane of motion, or at right angles
to the wind, and to the axis, as they are made accord-
ing to the common pradtice in England, that their
velocity, unloaded, is above 4 times, and loaded to
a maximum, above 3 times greater than that of the
wind :' but that when the Dutch fails, or enharged
ſails, are in their beſt poſitions, their velocity un-
loaded is 4. times, and loaded to a maximum, at a
medium” the Dutch fails are 2,7, and the enlarged
fails 2,6 times greater than the velocity of the wind,
Hence we are furniſhed with a method of knowing
the velocity of the wind, from obſerving the velocity
of the windmill fails; for knowing the radius, and
the number. of turns in a minute, we ſhall have the
velocity of the extremities ; which, divided by. the
following diviſors, will give the velocity of the
wind,
unloaded 4.2
loaded —3.3
Dutch fails in their beſt poſition -- ata Li

oaded —2.7
unloaded 4.0
loaded— 2.6

From the above diviſors there ariſes the following
compendiums ; ſuppoſing the radius to be 3o feet,
which is the moſt uſual length in this country, and
the mill to be loaded to a maximum, as is uſually the
caſe with corn mills ; for every 3 turns in a minute,
of the Dutch ſails in their common poſition, the wind
ill move at the rate of 2 miles an hour ; for every
5 turns in a minute, of the Dutch ſails in their beſt

pofttion, the wind moves 4, miles an hour ; and for
every 6 turns in a minute, of the enlarged ſails in
their beſt poſition, the wind will move 5 miles an
hour,

The following table, which was communicated
to me by my friend Mr. Rouſe, and which appears to
have been conſtructed with great care, from a con-
fiderable number of facts and experiments, and which
having relation to the ſubject of this article ; I here
inſert it as he ſentit to me: but at the ſame time muſt
obſerve, that the evidence for,thoſe numbers where
the velocity of the wind exceeds 50 miles an hour,
do not ſeem of equal authority with thoſe of 50 miles
an hour and under, It is alſo to be obſerved, that
the numbers in col. 3. are calculated according to the
ſquare of the velocity of the wind, which, in mode-
rate velocities, from what has been before obſerved,
will hold very nearly. y

VII. concerning the abſolute effett, produced by a
given velocity of the wind, upon ſails of a given
magnitude and conſtrutfion,

It has been obſerved by praQtitioners, that in mills
with Dutch fails in the common poſition, that when
they make about 13 turns in a minute, they then

in the laſt article, when the velocity of the wind is
$3 miles an hour, or 125 feet in a ſecond ; which,
in common phraſe, would be called a freſ> gale. The experiments ſet down in Tab.
