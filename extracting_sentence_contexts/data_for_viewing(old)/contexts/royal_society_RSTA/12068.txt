calorimeter and obtained a higher value, but it was in an early and very defective
form of the instrument, and an error of positive sign, as I afterwards found, very
certainly obtained in those experiments.

Considering this number in the light of Mr. Grirrirus’ remarks, it certainly
supports his contention that Rreanavir made an error of excess in his value of the
mean calorie—0° to 100°. The above number is however, even less than the value
supposed by Mr. Grirrirns to be the true number. For, as I understand,
Mr. Grirrrrus’ L is calculated on the calorie at 15° C. as unity. If this is also
—as Mr. GrirrirHs suggests as probable—in close agreement with the mean calorie,
0° to 100°, then the mean specific heat from 12 to 100 should come out only a very
little less than unity. In fact, by plotting Barrort and Srracctatt’s observations
below 15°, we can estimate what the mean specific heat from 12° to 100° ought to be
if the mean from 0 to 100 is the same as the specific heat at 15° and both equal
unity. A rough estimate gives this to be 0°9995.

My value is therefore too low to be in harmony with the supposition that the mean
calorie and the 15° unit are identical. The value of the latent heat of steam is, of
course, involved, for the steam calorimeter can only give a ratio, and, if the number
now obtained is correct, it follows that either the latent heat assumed is too low, or
the specific heat of water is even lower than it is supposed to be, or possibly both are

somewhat incorrect.
