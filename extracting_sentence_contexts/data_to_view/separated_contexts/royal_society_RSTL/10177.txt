At Ã¾ we have the thick, older, cell-walls
of the medullary cells, whilst at c we have the newly formed septa by which each older
cell is becoming divided into two or more new ones. The older cells exhibit the
form of regular parenchyma ; the new ones are extremely irregular in 8ize and form,
and would obviously require to undergo a considerable expansion, leading to a steady
enlargement, of the entire medulla, before they attained to the regular forms of the
parent cells. Every fact observed thus far indicates that the vascular cylinder, a,
develops centripetally, and that the multiplication of the medullary cells here demon-
strated to have existed wag preparatory to the conversion of the outermost of them
into new vessels, The known facts of enlargement in the sizes of and in the number
of vessels composing the vascular cylinder thus receives a probable explanation. *

Halonia. In my memoir, Part II, p. 222, et 8eq., I described the organization of 8ome Halonie
in which the central axis consisted, as in mosb of the young Lepidodendroid branches,
of a central medulla surrounded by a vascular, non-exogenous cylinder.
