The corresponding irrotational velocities are also unsuitable for the
same reason. We might try to get over the latter difficulty by adding a suitable
solution of (3.4). It can be shown that this is not possible, but it is unnecessary
to give the proof here, since the fact that the pressure does not satisfy the necessary
conditions is sufficient to render the value of 4 given by (10.82) inadmissible. Thus
the formula (10.81) does not really give a lift at all.

11â€”Tue Crecunation IN THE WAKE

It is well known that in practice the lifting force on a body is always associated
with a system of trailing vortices in the wake. We therefore proceed to investigate
the distribution of vorticity at a great distance from the body in the present theoretical
solution.
