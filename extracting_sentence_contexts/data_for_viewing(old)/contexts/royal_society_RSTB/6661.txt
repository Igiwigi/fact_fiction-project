that the acceptability of a host can be gauged from the frequency of attack as indicated
by the adoption of the piercing posture by the female. Although this act of piercing
has been demonstrated in many insects to be conditional upon the odour stimulus,
final acceptance of any host depends upon a combination of factors and can only be
assessed by the presence or absence of a parasite egg.

(b) The death of the host and its contained parasite

After establishing the existence of a selective faculty, attempts were made to ascertain
some of the factors upon which this selection is based. A certain proportion of the
overwintering Oovencyrtus females which survive to the following spring parasitize
and the progeny develop in gipsy moth eggs which have failed to hatch. As mentioned
in the Introduction, advantage may be taken of this fact to overcome difficulties in the
laboratory breeding of this parasite due to the emergence of the host larvae; this is
prevented by killing the hosts by immersion in hot water prior to exposure to the
female parasites. Reflexion on this technique suggested that an examination of the
selection in hosts containing dead or live parasites might reveal some interesting facts
bearing on this question. Accordingly, the following series were arranged in the
standard manner in Petri dishes, with fifty hosts in each container. With the exception
of the control (series 1) the hosts were alternated in the normal way, so that every
female had a definite choice of media in which to deposit her eggs.

Sertes 1: Dead hosts unparasitized.
Series 2: Live hosts unparasitized alternated with dead hosts unparasitized.
