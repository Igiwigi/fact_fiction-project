appertain to stations $80 circumstanced. In this country, a s0mewhat different mode
of viewing the magnetic system of the globe from that which prevailed generally in
France, caused an opinion to be entertained, that a different line from any of those
suggested by M. Araco might not improbably prove the dividing line of the two mag-
netic hemispheres in this respect ; and that the phenomena of the diurnal variation,
whatever they may be, which should characterise the dividing line, might be most
advantageously studied at a station chosen in its vicinity. The line here referred
to passes round the globe, crossing the several meridian lines at points where the
magnetic intensity in each is a minimum : or, it may be more precisely defined, as
the locus of the points of minimum intensity of all lines on the surface of the earth
drawn at right angles to itself. Its position has been traced through all the meridians
of the globe with considerable approximation*. It is not by its definition necessarily
an isodynamic line, or a line of equal magnetic force; and in fact, it is far from
being 80, the intensity of the force ranging in different parts of the line from 6:4 to
7'6 in absolute measure. Jt happens that Singapore, which, as already stated, is
Situated close to the terrestrial equator, and near the line of no dip, is in a part of the
globe where the lines of least force and of no dip approach each other most nearly ;
consequently the observations at Singapore might be expected to exemplify the
