A heightened sen-
sitivity to same-sex aggression in males, as proposed by some
authors [22], could not be statistically confirmed by the present
data. However, a weak differentiation of male aggression
signals from male control signals in male participants is
suggested by visual inspection of the grand averages (figure 1)
and direct effect testing (P3-2 amplitude: EMO within male
sweat within men Fj 4,=4.14, p=0.048). Whereas brain
responses to male aggression sweat in females could be partly

due to the fact that male aggression sweat was slightly odorous
but male control sweat was not, the brain responses to female
aggression sweat in male participants cannot be explained by
any odour-related effects. In conclusion, chemosensory aggression signals, derived
from highly angry and aggressively behaving sweat donors,
were obtained from and presented to both genders. The
sweat samples were only weakly odorous, they failed to
convey a distinct odour quality profile, and intensity ratings
were not associated with the emotional state of the odour
donors.
