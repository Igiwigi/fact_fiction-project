for Kew and Greenwich arises of course simply from the method of selection. A
considerable number of days treated as “ ordinary” at Kew would fairly rank as days
of disturbance when regarded from the standpoint either of the amplitude or the
number of the oscillatory movements, and would most naturally be classified as dis-
turbed for purposes such as those of Mr. Maunprer. The chief difference in the totals
is for 1892 and 1893, especially the latter year. In 1893, sunspots were at their
maximum, and the regular diurnal range was very large. A comparatively trifling
disturbance might suffice to bring the range over 20’, which Mr. Exuis treats, at
least roughly, as a minimum value for a disturbance ; thus, when main importance
was assigned to the amplitude of the range, it was only natural to reach a larger
number for the disturbed days in 1893 than when attention was directed to the
greater or less abnormality of the curve. As compared to the two adjacent years,
1893 was, in fact, remarkable for the extraordinary absence of irregular movements.
§6. Table IL gives the distribution of the disturbances and disturbed days
throughout the year, with corresponding data from Mr, Maunper’s list ; it also gives
some particulars as to the amplitudes of the movements. In two cases, March—
April, 1891, and January-February, 1896, where successive disturbed days belonged
to two different months, the disturbance has been counted as two. In the second of
these cases six successive days were treated as disturbed; no other sequence of
disturbed days exceeded four. The Kew data in Table IL give a smoother annual
