on account of the clear evidence which it affords of the formation of some new chemical
compound of high dextrorotatory power, perhaps an anhydride :

HO.CH.CO. HO.CH.CO.
| ZO, compare | /NCHs3
HO.CH.CO’ HO.CH.CO
for which [aly = +124", [M]p = +281°, or a sulphate :
/O.CH.CO.OH HO.CH.CO.O.

SOC | or vei] PSO:
0.CH.CO.OH HO.CH.CO.O

Of special interest is the fact, which is disclosed by plotting 1/a against \?, that,
whatever the nature of this compound may be, it is sufficiently “ fixed” to give rise
to a rotatory dispersion which, in the case of five readings out of six, appears to obey
the “simple” law « = k/(\*—),*). In view of the importance of these observations
we made several attempts to repeat them, in order to test the validity of the “ simple ”
dispersion law by means of fresh data extending over a wider range and including a
larger number of wave-lengths ; but, up to the present, we have not succeeded in prepar-
ing solutions sufficiently clear to use for such a test.

-In quite a different category must be placed Bror’s observation that aluminium
tartrate, which is strongly dextrorotatory in dilute solutions, becomes levorotatory
when the solution is concentrated (‘Comptes Rendus,’ 1835, vol. 1, p. 459; ‘Mém.
Acad. Sci.,’ 1838, vol. 16, Tables 12, 13, 14, at end of volume). It is possible that
