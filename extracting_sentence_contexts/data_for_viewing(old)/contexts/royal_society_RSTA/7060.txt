In two cases, 23 4 and 23

5|, the densities of the polyhedra differ from those of the
corresponding Schwarz triangles: 2 3 4| has density 1 and 2 35 | has density 3, compared
with densities 7 and 9 respectively for the triangles (2.3 4) and (2 35). This discrepancy
can be traced to the fact that the vertex-figures are obtuse-angled, and that in 2 3 4], for
example, all except the hexagonal faces are retrograde. It is possible to imagine a distorted
form of 2 3 4| whose vertex figure is acute-angled and whose density is 7. As this is deformed
into 23 | the hexagonal faces pass through the centre of the polyhedron and the density
becomes |7—8|=1. Similarly, 255) has all faces except twelve decagons retrograde,
giving the density |9—12| = 8. We note that 23 $| has the same density as the colunar
triangle (2 3 4), and that 25] has the same density as the colunar triangle (2 3 5).

Ifp = q =r, so that the triangle (p q 7) is equilateral, we have the regular polyhedron
bpp| = {2p,3} (p= 2, §, 8 9).
If p = g+r, so that (p qr) is isosceles, we have
