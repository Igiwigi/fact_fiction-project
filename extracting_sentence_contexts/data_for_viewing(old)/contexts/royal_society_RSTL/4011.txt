plane of second reflexion to the first,

Though the snbject of metallic reflexion is till in a condition of great obscurity, as
to the mechanical causes to which its peculiar character is referrible, yet the applica-
tion of the undulatory theory at least enables us to trace and connect some of its
laws, and in the attempt to pursue such an application to some further relations, the
nature of my researches may be hriefly explained as follows :â€”

1. So far as the objects of my former inquiry were concerned, it sufficed to take
the formula there employed for the polarized rings in the simplified form resulting
from snpposing a common coefficient to the two component vibrations; the plane of
original polarization inclined 45* to that of reflexion, and 90? to that of analyzation.
With reference however to some of the facts connected with observations at different
incidences and azimuths of the polarizer, as well as on other grounds, it seemed
desirable to generalize that formula by removing the above-mentioned restrictions ;
and I have accordingly here given an expression for the rings in elliptic light of all
degrees with general coefficients, and for all positions of the polarizer and analyzer ;
which, though without difficulty deducible, has not, as far as I am aware, been stated
by any writer.

2. With respect to the general character of the rings, the slightest observation
shows that the distinction between the dark and bright centred systems in plane
polarized light, though modifeed, is not lost, in the lower degrees of ellipticity ; it dis-
appears only when the light becomes perfectly circular; when the distinction is only
Seen in the changed direction of dislocation.
