OWEN ON THE MAMMARY GLANDS

ture, and on skinning her while yet warm, it was observed that milk oozed
through the fur on the stomach, although no teats were visible on the most mi-
nute inspection ; but on proceeding with the operation {0 feats or canals were
discovered, both of which contained milk. The carcase also of this female
Mr. Mavrz has kindly forwarded.”

In the preceding account, therefore, two important facts are distinctly tated ;
the one, that the ova of the Ornithorhynchus attain the size of a large musket-
ball, and, like the eggs of the oyo-viviparous reptiles, have a oft outer covering ;
the other, that the fluid secreted by the abdominal glands is milk. The first of
these statements would of course derive additional value if the period of the
year were stated when the eggs 80 deyeloped were observed ; and the precise
part of the body in which they were situated, whether in the ovary, the ovi-
duct, or the cloaca: also, whether they were obseryed at the same time that
the female with her young was captured, or at what distance of time from that
event. With respect to the supposed portions of egg-shell found in the nest, it is
obviously far from being conclusive as to the oyiparous character of the Orni-
thorhynchus ; since, when it is considered that the excrement and urine are
expelled by the same orifice, we may readily suppose the former to be coated,
as in birds, with the salts of the urine, and to have given rise to the above
appearances.
