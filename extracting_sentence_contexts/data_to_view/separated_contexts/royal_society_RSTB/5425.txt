The three segments anterior to these possess mesoderm which
arises in a different manner from that of the region behind them, and in these segments
only, mesodermal masses rather than definite somites are differentiated. The tritocerebral
neuromere is small and develops in close contact with the deutocerebral neuromere. Added to these are the further difficulties presented by the great curvature of the
embryonic head and the fact that external segmentation manifests itself before the
mesoderm has taken on a metameric arrangement.

(a) Appendages.â€”The antenne, mandibles, maxilla and labium develop in the
usual manner as paired hollow evaginations of the ectoderm beneath their respec-
tive mesoderm masses and lateral to their neuromeres. They are from their first
appearance easily recognised and are all primarily postoral in position. As soon as the
embryo undergoes the anterior dorsal curvature already described (EASTHAM, 1927)
an anterior region occupying a dorsal position in the egg (fig. 16, of that paper) develops
extensive lateral outgrowths prominently incurved at the lateral and anterior borders.
