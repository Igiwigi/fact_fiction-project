of the daughter of King Cueors), has a base, according to VysE and PERRING, of 172-5,
feet square, and therefore 100 royal cubits square exactly.

But the same authors give the breadths of no less than seven of the passages in the
pyramids, including the entrances to the First, Second, and Third Pyramids, all of 415
inches (two cubits of 20-750 inches).

DovrsrnsR, from the measures of the nilometer at Elephantine and of three or four
cubits found in the ruins of Memphis, which almost exactly correspond with each other,
estimated the length of the royal cubit at 20-721 inches (se CoxDEs, Â© Dictionnaire des
Poids et Mesures *).

Looking to these facts, and feeling it almost certain that the common and the royal
cubit had some definite relation to one another, like that between the link and foot of
our own country (66 feet equal 100 links), I infer that the most probable length of the
royal cubit was 20727 inches, and that 88 royal cubits were equal to 100 common eubits
of 18:240 inches. :

This does not admit of rigid demonstration. The dimensions of VysEt and PERRING
seem to be given to the nearest half inch, and the measures of length sold in this country
differ from one another as much as the length of the double cubit in the Britigh Museum
differs from its estimated length.
