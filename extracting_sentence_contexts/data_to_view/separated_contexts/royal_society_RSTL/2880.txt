260 MR. NEWPORT ON THE TEMPERATURE OF INSECTS. made in the usual manner, by placing a considerable number of insects of the same
species together, and then introducing the thermometer among them. But it was a
few days previously to making these observations that I first noticed the interesting
fact, that each individual insect maintains its own temperature, which is perceptible
externally by the thermometer, and that the amount of this varies in the different
conditions of the same insect. The observation was first made on the larva of Sphinx
Atropos, LaxN., and on that of Pygara bucephala, STEPn., as will presently be
shown. During the time I have been engaged in preparing the present communication
I have become acquainted, through the kindness of Dr. ForBxs of Chichester, with
the recently published views of Dr. BzrTHoD, of Gottingen, who has made a series
of observations on the temperature of cold-blooded animals*, and among them several
on insects, 80mewhat similar to those which I now have the honour of submitting to
the Society.
