it agreeing with the one described by GutpBerc. However, a close examination
proved quite the contrary. It can only be said, in a general way, that both are
somewhat intermediate between the lower pliocene H. stvalensis and the existing
H. amphibius, a remark which likewise applies to H. Lemerlei; but otherwise the
® skull in the British Museum differs from the one described by GuLDBERG in various
respects, some of the variations being such that it is impossible to account for them
as being due to age or sex. The London skull appears to be equally different from
those described by GRANDIDIER in some points in which these last agree with the
& Christiania skull, so far at least as one may be allowed to judge from GRANDIDIER’S
description. Now, as it seems at first sight difficult to admit that two different
S forms of Hippopotamus existed in the same district, I feel almost inclined to

conclude that the differences alluded to may be due to the fact of the two skulls

= from Sirabé being of a different geological age.
However, I do not wish to insist too strongly on this point so long as the Paris

remains have not been submitted to a close comparison, in which would have to be
included as well, the remains sent to Berlin by Hipesranpr.
