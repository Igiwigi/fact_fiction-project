Consider u a physically realizable weak solution of the Euler equations, as introduced in
definition 2.3, and let {u”} be a physical realization of u. In order to prove theorem 2.4, we will
establish that u satisfies the inviscid energy balance identity (2.2), by passing to the limit v > 0 in
(3.1).

From condition (2a) of definition 2.3, the family {u”} converges to u weakx-L™((0, T); L?(T?)). In
addition, we have F’ — F weak-L1((0,T); L?(T?)) (condition (2b)) and Up > uo strongly in L?(T?)
(this is condition (2c)). Using these facts, and in view of (3.1) it is easy to see that, in order to prove
theorem 2.4, it is enough to show that the weak-« convergence of u’ is, in fact, strong, and that the
energy dissipation term (2.5) vanishes in the limit. Let us begin by addressing strong convergence.

Lemma 3.1. Let u € C([0,T);L2(T?)) be a physically realizable weak solution with external forcing
FeL'((0,T);L?(T?)) and let {u"} be a physical realization. Assume that hypotheses 2.4—2.4 from theorem
2.4 are satisfied. Then u® — u strongly in C([0,T); L(T)).

Proof. Let p > 1 be such that 2.4-2.4 from theorem 2.4 are satisfied.
