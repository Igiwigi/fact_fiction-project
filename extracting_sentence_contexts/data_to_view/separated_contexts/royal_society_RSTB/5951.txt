enlarged, appearing as wide, somewhat flattened tubes, sometimes partially filled by a
deeply staining material and bounded by a flattened nucleated layer of no great thick-
ness, in which cell outlines are not apparent. So far, I have failed to observe any of
these glands opening on the surface. That is no doubt to be accounted for by the
fact that the zone is clothed all over by a very peculiar thick cellular layer, composed
of large vacuolated cells, of quite variable form and superimposed on each other, several

endometrium. ‘here are indications that during life the trophoblast of the adjacent
chorion was in intimate contact with its surface.
