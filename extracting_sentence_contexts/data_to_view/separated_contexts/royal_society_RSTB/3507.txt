All the species here described are new, and all are described from the anatomical
structure of some or other of their parts. The question of their relationship to some
of the numerous fragments of leaf and stem impressions which have been described
from the Cretaceous of many countries is a difficult one, a question, in fact, which
at this stage it is impossible to answer. That the commonest among our petrified
plants should be, in matter of fact, actually the same natural species as the commonest
among the impressions is very likely, although no weight can be placed on such
an assumption, The same difficulty exists in dealing with the Palwozoie floras,
where the number of impressions correlated with structural material is extraordinarily
small. Our nodules, however, are rather more hopeful in this respect than the

Paleozoic ones, and there is reason to suppose that in the future something substantial
may be done in this direction.
