their number, I consider that the error in this determination may equal, though it
probably does not exceed, 14 per cent.

If, as in the case of P and Hg, we try to verify this value by a comparison with
the indices of compounds of sulphur and of its refraction equivalent, we are met by
anomalies which show that no single value of the refractivity of sulphur will satisfy
all cases.

Table X. gives the indices and refractivities of the compounds of sulphur, the
refractivities of all of whose constituents are known. It will be seen that the
refractivities which must be assigned to 8, in order to satisfy the additive law,
vary widely from the value of 551 here given for 8, In SO,, H,8, SO,Cl.,, and
notably in H,SO, and SO,HCI, a smaller value would best accord with the facts. In
SOCI,, PSCl,, P,S, the value 551 would fit in excellently. In SCl., 8,Cl, a value
slightly larger, and in CS,, whose refractivity is 1476, a much larger value is
required ; for the highest contribution we can expect from C. is 250, which would
leave 610 to be accounted for by each of the sulphur atoms. Finally, the smaller of
the two refraction equivalents calculated by GLApsToNE for § (141), when compared
with that of O (2°8), would point to a value as high as 680.

All that can safely be concluded from these highly interesting anomalies is that
the refractive power of sulphur varies greatly, according to the nature of the
compound which it forms, and that the value now found is not far from the mean
round which the discrepant values are grouped.
