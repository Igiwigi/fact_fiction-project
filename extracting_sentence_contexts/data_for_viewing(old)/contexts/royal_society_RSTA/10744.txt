8 conductivity of compressed gases must be taken into account when treating questions
Srelative to the mean temperature of the sun, its rate of cooling, or more generally,
3 any problem dealing with the physical state of gaseous astral bodies.
= Although extrapolations are always very uncertain, in the present case it seems
S justifiable to conclude that under the very great pressures with which astronomical
= physics has to deal, all gases or vapours would transmit heat at a higher rate than
= the best conducting solids known.
& From a practical point of view, the results obtained explain the very rapid cooling
& of the products of an explosion, a fact which has not only been noticed during the
3 course of experiments on ballistics, but has long been well known to all engineers
5 engaged in the construction of gas engines.
z The relatively small cooling surface required, in the case of gases under high
Q pressures, is a fact that had been previously noticed, and is already to some extent
taken account of in the design of the modern compressors.

The laws of thermo-dynamics show that the efficiency of all heat engines is
dependent on their temperature range and pressure : in compliance with these laws
the pressures used are daily becoming greater. It is therefore hoped that the present
investigation may be of some use to those engaged in practical engineering.

Before closing, I desire to express my indebtedness to Dr. Lupwic Monp, the
donor of the Davy-Faraday Laboratory, at which Institution the greater part of the
work was carried out. My sincere thanks are also due to Dr. ALEXANDER Scorr for
the kind way in which he has facilitated the research by every means in his power.
