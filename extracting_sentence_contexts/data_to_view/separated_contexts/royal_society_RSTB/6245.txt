That this space is due to a sudden upward

movement of the axial part of the base of the polyp, and not to a temporary cessation
of the secreting powers of this part of the ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the
peripheral extensions of the lamellae laid down to form the tabula follow immediately
the peripheral extensions of the lamellae at the bottom of the space (fig. 43, Plate 30).*
The development of tabulae, or rather of inter-tabulate spaces, is due to the periodic
relief of stress in the base of the polyp (see Introduction). Stress arises when the
peripheral parts of the corallum grow vertically more quickly than the axial parts. This differential growth results when the rate of deposition of fibres is greater at
the apices of the trabecular invaginations than along the uninvaginated parts of
the base.
