is a resolution, we would have coker ¢) = K[x1,...,x;]/Im ¢1 = K[x1,...,x,]/I. Thus, l= Im ¢) = in
{0}. But I is not the zero ideal, as we are assuming that f is in I. Moreover, the membership problem 4
is already solved if I was the zero ideal. [8

Thus, as coker ¢; = K[x1,...,Xr]/Im ¢) = K[x1,...,x,]/I and we are assuming that f is in I, we :
have f in Im¢,. Now, suppose that there are w,z € F,, with w #z such that $1 (w) = ¢1(z) =f. In the
analogy we have been considering, we would say that there were two ‘proofs’ for the membership
of f in I, given there were two coordinates for f, namely w and z. Now, note that w and z are in
the same coset of ker ¢1, that is, there is a v € Fy such that w,z € v + ker $1. So, w and z are the
same modulo ker ¢; = Im ¢2, the second syzygy module. So, we have a ‘unique proof’ modulo
the second syzygy module.

We would like to note that we do not need a finite resolution. In fact, we only need, in this
context, a resolution of length n > 1.

3. Conclusion and future work

In this article, we established an analogy between the reduction of polynomials and proofs. Since
the reductions can be seen as paths in a graph, we also have an analogy between paths in the
graph and proofs. Doing this, we translated the problem of identifying proofs into a problem of
identifying paths. We were able to easily identify (by reordering) some paths. To identify all of
them we needed to consider the second syzygy module of a certain module. This syzygy module
could be obtained from the graph as well. Thus, in this context, we can always identify all proofs
and therefore the problem of identifying proofs is done. We may think that Hilbert may have
thought something similar, at least informally, since he referred to ‘routes’ while we refer to ‘paths’
