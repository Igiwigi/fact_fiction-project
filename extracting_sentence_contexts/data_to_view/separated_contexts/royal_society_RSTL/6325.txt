M. Fapne, to whose excellent paper I have already 80 often alluded, made, with
reference to some Chilopods, the very curious observation that the male spins a sort of
nest. or rather web of silk, and deposits in the middle a drop of semen, He has not
actually observed that the genus Cryptops has this extraordinary habit, but he thinks it
probable. From the fact that the two spermatheee of the female Oryptops generally
contain spermatozoa, it would seem that the females must, have the scarcely less remark»
able instinct to visit these nests, and in some manner absorb the contents into their
vagina. I find much difficulty in imagining how, under Mr. Darw1N's theory, such habits ag
these can have originated. It is easy enough to understand how they can continue
when they have once existed long enough to harden into an instinct; but I do not under-
sﬆtand how they can have begun.
