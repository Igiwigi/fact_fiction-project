Namely, the current density J is curl B (in units where the magnetic permeability 19 = 1),
so the current I(D) through a poloidal disc satisfies

10)=| J-ds= -dl. (2.1)

‘Poloidal’ means in a plane perpendicular to the direction of axisymmetry. Thus if there is a net
toroidal current then the magnetic field has a net poloidal component. By axisymmetry and volume preservation, the magnetic field lines lie on axisymmetric
surfaces called flux surfaces, and because of the toroidal current these surfaces are closed, in fact
tori. Furthermore, the magnetic field line flow on them is conjugate to a rotation. For flux surfaces
with irrational winding, the time-averaged first-order drift of a circulating charged particle across
flux surfaces is zero.
