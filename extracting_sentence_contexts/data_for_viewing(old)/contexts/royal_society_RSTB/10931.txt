a moderate degree of resemblance suffices to deceive it, and
therefore the process halts at that point.’

In arguing that the selective process comes to a halt, it is
clear that Bates was invoking a ‘relaxed selection’ argument
for imperfect mimicry, with the imperfect mimic enjoying
all the advantages of a more perfect mimic. However, it is
helpful to clarify the meaning of ‘suffices to deceive it’. In par-
ticular, the relaxed selection hypothesis does not rest on the
assumption that the differences between mimics and
models are unnoticed.

In fact, it has long been known that humans are capable of
probabilistically detecting even the smallest of differences
(such as whether a weight is lighter or heavier than a 100 g
standard [25]). Instead, we should recognize that it is not
what the receiver believes, but how it acts that shapes selection
on the mimic’s phenotype.

Why would a predator ever act against its beliefs? If pred-
ators maximize their return from any given encounter then
they should attack a prey item not when p > 0.5, but when
the expected benefits outweigh the expected costs, namely
pb>(1-—p)ec, ie. p>r/(1+r), where p is the estimated
