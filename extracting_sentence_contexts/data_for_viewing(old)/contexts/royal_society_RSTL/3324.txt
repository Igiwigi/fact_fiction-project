16. The addition of cold water does not immediately arrest the motions. I could
not discern any in the remains of the corpuscles after dilute acetic acid had been
added.

_ 17. TI have seen these motions of the altered blood-corpuscles, in fluid collected on
the fimbriated portion of the Fallopian tube, in a Rabbit which had not had connexion
with the male, but was killed during the rut.

18. They seem to be attended in some instances with a considerable increase in
the size of the corpuscle (fig. 3. y.)}.

19. Should these facts be thought to confirm the opinion of Hue, that the

because its corpuscles in certain altered states exhibit © vital action,” still his assertion
that © the red globules” are the least important part of the blood, will appear to have
no just foundation.

+ The examinations were usually commenced a few minutes after the animal had been killed.

{ Reference is made by R. Wacxzr to a statement of Czermac with which I am unacquainted. * Vital
motions,” 8xys Wacxxs, ** such as those which CzerMac maintains that he has observed (for instance in Blood
from the gills of the Proteus), I have never seen ; and this assertion certainly rests on an illusion occasioned
by the phenomenon which is produced by ciliary motion,” Wacns supposes the motions seen by CzErRMAc
to have been caused by portions of the gills, the cilia of which set the escaped corpuscles of the Blood in
