interest with workers interests, rather than the reverse alignment as often discussed, appears to
be a fruitful area for new development.

(b) Individuals and businesses: leisure

John Maynard Keynes, reflecting on this in his essay ‘Economic possibilities for our
grandchildren’, predicted in 1931 that ‘for the first time since his creation man will be faced with
his real, his permanent problem: how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest
will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well’ [29]. Keynes anticipated working
hours reducing initially to 15 h per person per week, and then falling further.

Keynes’ observation arose from the assumption that human beings had some finite set of
‘needs’ that could be sated. In fact, as described in the brief history of manufacturing above, once
these ‘needs’ were generally met in the developed economies by around the 1950s, manufacturers
turned instead to creating ‘wants.’ If the objective of industry is that every unit of capital must
expand, then demand must be expanded in order to absorb the output of ever more efficient
production. The efficiencies of the economies of scale must, therefore, be matched by marketing
campaigns to induce new purchasing. In contrast with Henry Ford’s steady refinement of the
Model-T, General Motors introduced the idea of a yearly model change in the 1920s, and
