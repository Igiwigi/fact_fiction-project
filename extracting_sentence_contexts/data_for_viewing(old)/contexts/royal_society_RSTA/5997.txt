terms of the emergent temperature-based Rayleigh and Nusselt numbers. As argued at the outset,
the definitions (2.10) and (2.11) are probably best-suited for comparison with experimental results,
and we provide in figure 5 a summary of the bounds in the plane (Ramax, NUmax). The upper
bound (2.28) on the Nusselt number scales as the square-root of the Rayleigh number. It applies
only to turbulent branches of solutions, according to the definition (1.2) given at the outset and
assuming that such branches of solutions exist. By contrast, the best upper bound (2.34) over all
flow solutions scales linearly in Rayleigh number, a behaviour associated with laminar analytic
flow solutions such as the one derived in [22].

We then turned to numerical and experimental data to validate the existence of turbulent
branches of solutions. The numerical data indeed point to a finite limiting value of the dissipation
coefficient as the flux-based Rayleigh number—and thus the Reynolds number—increases. We
stress the fact that the validation of the fully turbulent assumption (1.2), when combined with
the ‘ultimate’ scaling-law for heat transport Nu ~ /RaPr, leads to Spiegel’s free-fall scaling-
law for the velocity field Re ~~ /Ra/Pr, where the Reynolds number Re is based on the height
of the domain and the root-mean-square velocity. In other words, using CISS we can validate
both Spiegel’s prediction of a diffusivity-free regime for the heat transport, Nu ~ /Ra Pr, and the
free-fall scaling assumption that underpins it [21].

The upper bounds derived in the present study provide a useful point of view to discuss
the proposed scaling theories for CISS. For instance, in Lepot et al. [12], we report a scaling
exponent y ~ 0.55 for the scaling-law Nu ~ RaY at Pr =7. Assuming that the flow becomes fully


turbulent at large driving amplitude, the slight departure of the measured exponent from 1/2
