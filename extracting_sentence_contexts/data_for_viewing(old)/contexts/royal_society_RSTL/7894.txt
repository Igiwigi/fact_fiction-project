of the mature animal which were transmitted to me from freshwater deposits in another
and remote locality of Australia; and, for a short time, I believed them to belong to a
Proboscidian, referring them, in 1843, on the authority of a drawing of part of a jaw
and teeth transmitted to me by Sir Trnomas MrTCcHELL, to the Dinotherian section of
that order*.
