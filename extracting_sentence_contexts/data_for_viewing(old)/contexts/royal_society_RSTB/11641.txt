mitochondrial activity in sperm’; my italics). When the energy
for the final entry of the female is provided by the female
incurrent siphon, such active competition seems absent.

This brings me to the second, and even more important,
point of discussion, regarding the relation between OXPHOS
activity and generation of mutagenic ROS. Here much is
made of the fact that lower amounts of ROS (as compared
with ‘basal’ ROS production) can be obtained during high exer-
cise activity. The reference in this context is to Barja’s excellent
‘Updating the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging’ [7].
Barja is defending the theory that mutagenic ROS (by mutating
both mtDNA and nuclear DNA) are responsible for ageing.
One of the many misconceptions he deals with is the naive
vision of a direct relationship between mitochondrial ROS
production and oxygen consumption; thus quoting him in
this context seems a bit disingenuous. Mitochondrial ROS
formation depends on membrane potential (Ap), kind of

oxidative substrates, possibility of reverse electron transport
