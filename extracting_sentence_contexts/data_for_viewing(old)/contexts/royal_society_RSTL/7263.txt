is proved by constructing the symbols of chemical substances upon this hypothesis.
There are, however, certain exceptions, be they real or apparent, in which this mode
of exprexsion is impossible, and it will be seen on reference to the table of exceptions
(See. VIIL (4)) that this hypothesis rejects as inadmissible, not only the cases which
are rejected by the atomic theory, but those also which are rejected by the empirical
law of even numbers (p. 786). The symbolic system which is here given is the expression
of these laws, by the truth of which it must stand or fall. The unit of the element
mercury, and the units of several other metals, such as zine, cadmium, and tin, s0 far as
our imperfect experience extends, appear to be analogous in this respect to hydrogen.
But these are the only elements of this simple composition. The units of a second
group, of which the element oxygen, symbolized as £?, may be taken as a type, and to
which belong sulphur, 82, and selenium, a?, are composed of two identical simple weights,
and the facts of the science do not permit us to asxume these units as otherwise composed.
Lastly, another group of elements appears in this system of a different and more complex
composition, to which group belong the elements chlorine «x?, bromine «{3?, iodine aw?,
nitrogen «?, phosphorus (2), arsenic («g?)?, and in all probability numerous other
elements. The simplest view which, consistently with the fundamental hypothesis (Sec.
VIL. Group 1(1)), can be taken of the composition of these elements, regard being had
to the total system of chemical combinations, is that they are severally composed of a
unit of hydrogen and of two identical simple weights, as, for example, in the case of
chlorine, of the simple weight « and two of the simple weights symbolized by x, 80
