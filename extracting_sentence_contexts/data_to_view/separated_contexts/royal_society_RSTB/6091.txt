Such
work relates to populations of wild flies. But there is a secondary group of problems,
which may become more and more important ; they centre round the maintenance
of a supply of clean flies in the laboratory at all times of year, for purposes of
transmission, etc. It is thought that the facts here recorded will be of value to those
who wish to carry out work of this nature. Our work was much hampered
because so little is recorded about the biology of these insects in the laboratory. The work here described was performed at the laboratory of the Tsetse
Investigation at Gadau in the north of Nigeria (12° N., 10° E.).
