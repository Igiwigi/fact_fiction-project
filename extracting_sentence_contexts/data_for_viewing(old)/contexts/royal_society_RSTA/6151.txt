the scalar field mass m must be in the ballpark of a GUT scale, although we should explicitly
remark that ¢ has nothing to do with inflation since ¢ has no effective potential. Actually, we
need not specify any particular property of it apart from its mass, see [58] for more details.
RVM-inflation was studied phenomenologically in a variety of works in the past, see
[95,124,127]. These studies were based on a generalized VED of the form
2p+2
patto= 5 («+1 +0! ) (p=1,2,3,...). (7.4)
K H,?

Here, co is a constant of dimension +2 in natural units, closely related to A, and Hy is the scale
of inflation; v, and a are dimensionless coefficients. For a =0, we recover the low-energy form
of the RVM, equation (5.10), but only in the presence of higher powers of H beyond H? inflation
becomes possible. In fact, in the early universe the term H?P+2 is dominant and one can show
that inflation occurs for any p>1. Once more the participation of only even powers of H is
a requirement of general covariance of the action. The QFT-based model of inflation (7.1) just
corresponds to p=2, for which H® is the driving force of inflation. We should point out that
although the mechanism of inflation based on the higher power of the VED (7.4) was amply
studied phenomenologically in the aforementioned references, it had never been substantiated
on fundamental grounds. The demonstration that RVM-inflation is a consequence of calculations
within QFT in curved space-time has been accomplished only very recently in [58], where the
specific VED form (7.1) for inflation was explicitly derived. Worth noticing is also the existence
of a string-inspired version of RVM-inflation (see [128,129], and particularly also [130] in this
theme issue), in which inflation is triggered by gravitational anomalies and the condensation
of primordial gravitational waves in the very early universe, capable of engendering ~H*
contributions to the VED. It is amusing to think of a double trigger for RVM-inflation from H* as
