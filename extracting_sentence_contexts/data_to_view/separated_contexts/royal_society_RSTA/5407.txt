Hence, these
‘uncertainty data’ cannot be supplied to the CFD practitioners. In the light of
his, it seems surprising, considering the potential data scatter, that most CFD
simulations seem to capture shock location very well. The surprising level of
agreement perhaps reflects the fact that CFD is still a heavily postdictive
