old, and of a fully-grown Python, were also examined.

The thymus of the Tortoise, when the animal is quite small, rezembles that of the
Mammal ; and then the follicle is composed of cortex and medulla ; but as the animal
grows older the follicle is composed of three parts : an outer cortical part, which is
formed of flattened cells, with a delicate reticulum stretching between them (see

APlate 95, fig. 105) ; a medullary portion, containing most of the concentric corpuscles ;

Sand between these two a zone of tissue, looking as if it were compressed, containing

EN ring or rings of yessels, and many lymphoid cells. This peculiarity of the thymus
Zof the Tortoise depends on the fact that the cortex does not disappear more rapidly

zthan the medulla, as in the Mammal or Bird ; but the lymphoid cells disappear, and

She network of connective-tissue-corpuscles increases, and takes their place. A change,

Something like this, is shown in the Mammal in Plate 93, fig. 80, but, it does not there

Sproceed to anything like the same extent, as in the Tortoise, where the cortex finally

Feontains hardly any lymphoid cells. Many pigmented cells can be seen in the connective-

Stigsue at, the edge of the follicle, and surrounding the invading blood vessels ; these
