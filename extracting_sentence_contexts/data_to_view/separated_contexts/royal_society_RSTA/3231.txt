take a different point of view: I dismiss naturalness arguments and explore instead the option
that the scale of new physics might be much larger than the TeV scale, perhaps even as large as
the Planck scale, Mp}. It is a non-trivial fact that the SM can be extrapolated up in energy in the huge range from M; to
Mp) ina consistent manner, e.g. without any of the couplings hitting a Landau pole. Nevertheless,
the extrapolated Higgs quartic coupling has an interesting behaviour [4-10]: due to one-loop
corrections from the heavy top, its beta function is large and negative and this drives it to negative
values at around A; ~ 10!°GeV.! This running coupling is shown in figure 1a, with the bands
illustrating the impact of experimental errors in the top mass, the Higgs mass and the strong
coupling, as indicated.
