The more posterior part of the bone lies parallel to the lower edge of the septum nasi
‘aq in such a way that it might hypothetically be expected to fuse with its fellow to form

Es a bone similar to the mammalian vomer.

& These two cases show that it is not impossible for the paired vomers of a reptile to
2 a great extent to lose their primitive connection with the paraseptal cartilages and
& form a sheath to the lower edge of the nasal septum. At the same time the process

5 is not really similar to that which must have occurred in mammalian ancestors, if the

view that the mammalian vomer is the homologue of that of the reptiles be correct,
é because in each case it is associated with a very great reduction of the paraseptal
5 cartilages and of Jacobsen’s organ. Judging from the large size of the paraseptal
g cartilages in Monotremes, Marsupials, and Insectivora, this region was well developed
3 sin ancestral mammals.

3 This view of the mode of development of the mammalian vomer is supported by

a the fact that in Echidna and Mus (Gaver) and the Guinea-pig (PARKER) the
a mammalian vomer is developed as a paired bone. The alternative view of the homology of the mammalian vomer is that of
Bianp-Surron as developed by Broom. According to this theory the mammalian
yomer is not homologous with the prevomers of reptiles, but is developed from the
reptilian parasphenoid, J

Tn specimen 8 of Ornithorhynchus the paraseptal cartilages are well developed, as
shown in the model which Prof.
