S The envelopes of these eggs became expanded as under perfectly healthy and

i= favourable conditions ; but within two hours of the contact of the eggs with the fluid
= the yelks of the whole became very irregular, sbrivelled, and contracted, and assumed
an appearance very similar to that which first results from the application of a strong
D Solution of potass. Not one egg retained its spherical shape, but the whole entirely
S perished; and it may be needless to add, not an embryo was produced. S These facts then support the statement already made, that only while the sperma-
S tozoon continues to give evidence of vitality in its power of motion does it exert any
= fecundatory influence on the egg. They seem, too, to show that the period during
= which this vital force is retained by the mature spermatozoon after it is passed from
S the body of the Frog is perhaps shorter even than what I have stated, and that the
â€” limit, in regard to time, depends much on physical influences. In addition to this,
3 they seem to Show that after all ocular evidence of power in the spermatozoon is
5 lost, this body is inert, until decomposition has commenced, when its material con-
S 8tituents become injurious and destructive.
