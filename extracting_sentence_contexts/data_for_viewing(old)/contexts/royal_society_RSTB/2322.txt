The fact that lotusin is readily hydrolysed by hydrochloric acid and not by
sulphuric acid may perhaps be explained by assuming that an intermediate chlorimide
is formed through which the rupture of the molecule is facilitated—

The Hydrolysis of Cyanhydrins.—The constitutional formula we propose for lotusin
appeared to satisfactorily account for all its reactions with the exception of the
production of hydrocyanic acid by action of dilute hydrochloric acid, which required
further elucidation. For it is generally stated that cyanhydrins, whether derived
