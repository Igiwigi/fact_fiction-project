clearly a branch of enquiry which might with advantage be followed out by subsequent
observers.

In this connection the experiments of SHERRINGTON* are very suggestive, and we
shall refer again to this part of the subject in describing our experiments on bilateral
representation.

(d.) The Amount of the Galvanometric Readings.

Although, as has been stated, no exact comparison for quantitative purposes can
be made between different deflections of the galvanometer, when, being connected
with the central end of the exposed spinal cord, the cortex is excited, yet the
amounts of the different readings are in themselves of great interest, owing to the fact
that it is always possible with an excitable cortex and a sufficiently strong excitation
to obtain very large galvanometric deflections. It is obvious that the deflection is
dependent not merely upon the intensity but the duration of the stimulation, hence
the excitation was limited by the revolving key, previously described, to 5 seconds
Since, however, the cortical discharge lasts a variable time after the stimulus has ceased,
