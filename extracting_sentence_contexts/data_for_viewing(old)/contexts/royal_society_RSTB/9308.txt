The next step is to use large-scale techniques for molecular
profiling of tissues and cells from human vaccinees [7,16,17].
The tool kit accessible to modern immunologists includes a
broad range of ‘omics’ technologies, such as high-throughput
sequencing of DNA (DNA-seq), RNA (RNA-seq) or transcrip-
tion factor binding sites (chromatin immunoprecipitation,
ChIP-seq) [18], microarrays [7,9-11,16,17,19], high-resolution

mass-spectrometry proteomics/metabolomics [20], CyTOF
mass cytometer [21] and genome-wide RNAi screening [22].
It is essential that the data obtained from these techniques are
integrated or associated with data obtained from ‘convention-
al’ immunological assays, such as ELISA, ELISpot, FACS,
and neutralization assays. These assays enable quantita-
tive and qualitative assessment of immune status and
responses, and therefore can be useful for correlation analyses
or as endpoints in predictive analyses.

The third step is to generate mathematical models from
the molecular snapshots of cells and tissues that explain or
predict the structure and behaviour of the system being per-
turbed. There are a myriad of modelling frameworks that can
be applied to these purposes (reviewed in [23]), which range
from simple linear regression models to advanced and com-
putationally expensive feature selection methods for
