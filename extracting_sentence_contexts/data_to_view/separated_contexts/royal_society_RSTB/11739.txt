Animals (and particularly migrating El
(abiotic, and biotic, including social) animals such as birds or whales) should thus be less prone
to using inheritance systems with high turnovers and could
be expected to rely relatively more on sequencic than non-
sequencic inheritance [14]. We need more exploration of the
links between species movement abilities and the relative
role of genetic and epigenetic components, for which
methods are available [123,124].

(d) A historical parallel

In this paper, we proposed to articulate neo-Lamarckism and
neo-Darwinism around the idea that inclusive inheritance
systems are complex adaptations to environments varying
in complex ways [90]. A historical parallel can be drawn
