is equal to G°. Furthermore, the restriction to G° of any irreducible representation of G is irreducible.

Proof. In view of the definition, the computation of the monodromy groups is a special case
of the Goursat—Kolchin-Ribet proposition of Katz [17, Prop. 1.8.2] (noting that, with the notation
there, if the normalizer of ew is contained in GnG?, then G acts irreducibly on V;, because any
sub-representation is stable under the action of GnG? D Nouv) G? D Gi).


For the last part, let t be an irreducible representation of G. Note that Lo |

by the second condition in the definition of a generous tuple, and the fact that any g € G is of the S

for some & € Gm 1G; C Z(G;) and gj € GC, so that g=zh with z=(&) € Z(G) and h=(g;) € G6.
It follows that for any g = zh € G, we have

t(g) =t(zh) = t(z)t(h). =

As 1(z) is a scalar (because t if G-irreducible and z is central), we see that any G°-invariant : S
subspace is also G-invariant. a 1
