either, but not both, b and ¢ vanish, nor does it, unless we multiply it by 7/2 and
take its sine, equal the coefficient of correlation when a = d and b = e,
Again, we might deduce a fairly simple approximation to the coeflicient of correla-
tion from the Equation (xxiv.) for @, using only its first few terms.
