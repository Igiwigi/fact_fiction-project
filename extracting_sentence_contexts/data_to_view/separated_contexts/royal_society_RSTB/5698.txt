Fig. 21,
Plate 7, shows a young diarch root, with only primary tissues; there is a wide paren-
chymatous cortex, with a dark zone near the periphery. The same kind of cortex is
seen in many roots with secondary growth like those described above (fig. 20, Plate 7). Diagnosis.—In view of the facts now described we may re-define the genus Zygopteris
as follows :—

Genus Zygopteris, Corpa, emend. SAHNI. Stele cylindrical, with a stellate core of primary xylem and a thick outer zone of
secondary wood.
