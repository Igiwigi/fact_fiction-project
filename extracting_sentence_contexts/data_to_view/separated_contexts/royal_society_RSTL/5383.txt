It would appear that the 'elastic reaction developes this resistance to the full extent,
when the section is such that a straight line may be drawn from every point at the
outer portion to every point at the neutral axis within the section ; but that if the form
of section is such that straight lines drawn from the outer fibres, or particles, to the
neutral axis fall without the section (as in the case in the compound sections, Nos. 15
and 16), then it must be treated as two separate beams, each having that amount of
resistance of flexure due to the depth of the metal contained in it. Resistance of Flexure in Wrought Iron. Although from the fact, that in a cast-iron beam (the section being a solid rectangle)
the neutral axis was found to be at the centre of gravity of the section, it might haye
been inferred that the same would be found in wrought iron; yet it was considered
desirable to ascertain it by actual measurement. For this purpose two beams were
taken, one of rolled iron, 7 feet 6 inches long, 6 inches in depth, and 1+ inch in breadth;
the other of hammered iron, 8 feet long, 7+ inches in depth, and 1% inch in breadth,
Holes were drilled at about 6 inches on each side of the centre, or point of application
of the strain, for the insertion of the pins of the measuring instrument. The holes were
8ix in number, and placed at equal distances from the upper to the lower side of the
beam ; and the experiments were conducted in the same manner as those made with the
cast-iron beam, and described in my former paper.
