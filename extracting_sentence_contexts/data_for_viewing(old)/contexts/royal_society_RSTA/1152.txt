dispersion properties (ky = 0) of a2D gas flow at rest, with the same characteristics as for isothermal LBMs (vp = v). For the
2D map, dashed isolines range from —zc? /4 to —77r?/4 with a step of 22/4. Expressions of theoretical curves are [75,78,103]:
Im(as)/v = Im(ws)/v R, Re(as) /c = Mak and Re(a+)/c = (Ma + 1)k, where Ma is the mean Mach number.

that the propagation speed, or group velocity, is the slope of dispersion curves, one can conclude PD
that hydrodynamic waves propagate at constant speed whatever the value of k, at least in the :s
limit of vanishing viscosity [48]. When it comes to dissipation rates, they fit a quadratic trend 13
with respect to the wavenumber [Im()/v « K]and they are always negative. This means that the [3
dissipation of waves is even more important when their spatial frequency k is high. This translates 78
to the fact that viscosity impacts more small vortical structures than bigger ones. :3

(c) Linear behaviour of the D209 discrete velocity Boltzmann equation

In what follows, the linear behaviour of the D2Q9-DVBE is investigated by solving the eigenvalue
problem related to the perturbed equation (A 3). Hence, it is important to understand that V
waves will be evolving in the Fourier space, instead of the D + 1 waves encountered with the
isothermal NS equations. This is because the DVBE, and a fortiori the LBM, is a set of V equations
whose linear behaviour is entirely linked to V waves. Among them, D+ 1 modes linked to
hydrodynamics will be encountered, while V—(D + 1) non-hydrodynamic waves will also be
present in the Fourier space. By comparing modes obtained via the linearization of the DVBE
with those resulting from the linearized macroscopic equations, one is then able to investigate
potential defects of the DVBE in terms of macroscopic behaviour independently from the numerical
