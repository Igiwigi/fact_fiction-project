The second issue concerns the apparent lack of deceleration in the expansion of the Universe,
in fact an acceleration, at late times. This was determined by measuring the flux of a large number
of type Ia supernovae, considered standard candles, that occur at a specific redshifts z and forming
the ensuing redshift-magnitude relation. Fits of the evolution of the Universe to this relation


is best achieved by adding a cosmological term, A/3, to the equations that describe the scale
factor evolution of an homogeneous and isotropic universe [1]. Its energy density is such that it
contributes roughly 70% to the present closure density of the Universe, a value some 120 orders
of magnitude smaller than the ‘natural’ value of such a term, which it is believed ought to be of
order of the Planck energy density.

A rather interesting fact, noted some time ago [2], is that the introduction of DM to account
for the galactic rotation curves becomes necessary at regions where the acceleration of the
orbiting stars, a, drops below a characteristic value aj ~ 10-8 cms~?; interestingly the value of
this acceleration is close to cHo (c is the speed of light and Hp the value of the Hubble constant),
suggesting a cosmological origin of the underlying dynamics. A similar fact, not as much noted in
the literature, is that the introduction of Dark Energy as a means of accounting for the acceleration
of the Universe has occurred when the acceleration of its expansion RW dropped below this same
value ag.

To return to the essential aspects of the gravitational theory, one should note that GR (i.e.
Einstein gravity), despite its impressive achievements, is the only theory among the fundamental
interactions that is formulated not on a local invariance (gauge) principle but only on general
covariance and the demand that the resulting equations be second order; thus, it provides, in
