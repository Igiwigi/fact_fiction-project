Improving or maintaining species status
within protected areas could be taken to indicate success of
protection, even if the same trends are occurring in unprotec-
ted areas and impact is, in fact, zero. Similarly, a protected
area suffering declines in numbers of some species could be
viewed as a failure, even if trends in numbers under protec-
tion are dramatically better than more serious negative trends
without protection. Conservation resources can also be misdirected if counter-
factual biodiversity outcomes are not correctly defined. This
risk is illustrated by a measure of conservation progress
proposed in Australia [64]. The measure compares the
amount of additional protection, say of an ecosystem, with
the amount of loss of that ecosystem over a defined period,
but the measure can be unrelated to impact.
