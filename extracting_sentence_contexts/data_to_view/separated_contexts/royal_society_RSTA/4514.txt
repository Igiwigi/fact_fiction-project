‘Doubt is our product,’ ran the infamous memo written by one tobacco industry executive
in 1969, ‘since it is the best means of competing with the “body of fact” that exists in the
minds of the general public.’ The industry defended its primary product—tobacco—by
manufacturing something else: doubt about its harm. ‘No proof’ became a mantra that they
would use again [and again]... It also became the mantra of nearly every campaign in the
last quarter of the century to fight facts [1].
