* Professor DUNSTAN of the Royal Veterinary College, Edinburgh, informs us that it is a common
practice among veterinarians to cut out the ovaries of Bitches in cases where it is desired that they should
not come “on heat.” We note also that a Yorkshire Terrier in our possession, whose ovaries were extirpated
in December of last year has so far at any rate failed to show any signs of provestrum or estrus. This is
in accordance with the fact, about the truth of which most obstetricians agree, that women cease to
menstruate after ovariotomy (see p. 123, and cf. HALBAN, 1901, for Monkeys). It is to be noted also that
according to KNAUER (1900), removal of the ovaries in Rabbits produces a premature menopause, the
uterus undergoing atrophy, while if ovariotomy is performed prior to puberty, the uterus remains
infantile (see p. 125).
