The study of biological processes often relies on ensemble measurements for the

stance of each data point, or each individual organism, which make up any
distribution used to calculate a mean and characterize a phenomenon is
hugely important. Therefore, being unable to separate and interrogate the
nature of each individual entity within a distribution of data has hampered

population is key for understanding: (i) the variation upon which selection can
act to result in evolutionary adaptation [1,2], and (ii) the diversity of rare forms
present in a natural environment which can rise to prominence in the event of
environmental perturbation [3]. This is a hindrance when we consider the fact
that much of the interesting biology we seek to understand occurs on the scale
of a single cell, a scale that is often difficult to study experimentally.

Consider for example a simple experiment to ascertain the susceptibility
of a clonal population of bacteria to antibiotic treatment. A comparison of an
antibiotic-treated population versus an untreated population with a subsequent
measurement of the mean number of surviving cells can give an idea of the
overall efficacy of the antibiotic in use. However, it has been shown within
clonal populations of bacteria that there can be considerable differences in phys-
iological functions between individual cells [4-6]. Specifically, within the treated
population reside bacterial cells that can survive such treatment, persisting until
the drug is removed, when a subpopulation composed of what is known as pers-
