Devaney
et al. [75] developed a toolkit for accurately aligning monopho-
nic audio to MIDI scores as well as extracting and analysing
timing-, pitch-, and dynamics-related performance data from
the aligned recordings. The toolkit was applied in studying
intonation in three-parts singing.

4, Leaderâ€”follower relationship in orchestras

Orchestras are another particularly interesting instance of sen-
sorimotor coordination. In fact, in contrast with quartets or


other smaller ensembles, the social organization characterizing
these groups is based on a clear and formalized leadership. The
conductor is de facto the driving force behind the pattern of
group information flow, at multiple levels. The conductor is
not merely giving tempo to the players or the timing of attacks
during public performances.
