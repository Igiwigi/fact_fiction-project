Figure 4. SE benefits of optimizing different transmission fibre parameters: theoretical spectral efficiency curves as a
function of launched signal power limits for a representative communication system. (1-black line) Baseline parameters
of system length = 2000 km, amplifier spacing = 80 km, amplifier noise figure = 4.5 dB, channel spacing = 50 GHz,
baud rate=50Gbaud, fibre loss=0.22dBkm~', nonlinearity = 1.4(Wkm)~', dispersion = 16 psnm~' km~',
wavelength = 1550 nm, bandwidth = 5 THz, number of WDM channels = 101. In the additional plots, all other parameters
were kept the same as for the black curve other than (2-indigo line) nonlinearity = 0 (Wkm)~" (conventional Shannon
Limit for a SMF system); (3-blue line) loss reduced by a factor of 2-0.11 dB km~"; (4-dark green line) nonlinearity reduced by
1/1000; (5-orange line) dispersion increased by a factor of 2 to D = 32 ps nm~' km~"; (6-light green curve) amplifier noise
figure reduced to 1 dB; (7-red line) simultaneous changes (3â€”-6) to the baseline parameters as above. The figure highlights the
fact that even by radically improving fibre amplifier properties, then only relatively modest improvements in spectral efficiency
can be achieved. It should though be appreciated that the financial benefits of such radical property improvements could be
significant. (Figure courtesy of Prof. Andrew Ellis of Aston University, UK).

SDM is that if we can define N distinct spatial channels within a single fibre, then the overall
fibre capacity can be increased N-fold, or at least close to N-fold when any signal degradation
mechanisms/mitigation strategies are taken into account.

Interest in SDM has been revitalized due to the rapidly emerging need due to the exponentially
increasing traffic demands and concerns of a potential future capacity crunch and has been made
technically viable by accumulated advances in fibre research over many years. This includes both
the continued refinement of conventional solid fibres (both SMF and MMF variants), as well
as the development of the incredibly precise fabrication methods required to produce complex
