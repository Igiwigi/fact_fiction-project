Figure 3. Results of XPS analysis: (a) fitting results of deconvoluted Nis XPS spectra of four catalysts with different N contents
(results for SD only are not shown). Ns spectra were deconvoluted into five peaks, located at approximately 398.6, 400.5,
401.3, 402.0 and 404.5 eV, which correspond to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N, oxidized pyridinic N, and N-O, respectively.

band suggests the presence of multilayer graphene. The intensity of the two-dimensional band in
the case of the Fe/N/SD (4:10:10) sample was extremely high while the band was the broadest
in the case of the Fe/N/SD (2:10:10) sample. Thus, sample Fe/N/SD (2:10:10) contained
the smallest amount of graphite. In fact, from the BET surface areas shown in the electronic
supplementary material, figure S2, it was confirmed that sample Fe/N/SD (2:10:10) had a
specific surface area twice as large as that of sample Fe/N/SD (1:10:10). This probably resulted
in poor growth of the graphite crystals, which, in turn, increased the ORR activity. Thus, based
on the above-discussed results, it can be concluded that the growth of the graphite crystals
suppressed the ORR activity.

Figure 5a shows the fitting results for the deconvoluted Nis XPS spectra of the four catalysts
with different amounts of the Fe dopant; the result for the catalyst consisting only of SD is not
shown. The N1s peaks could be deconvoluted into five peaks, as shown in figure 3a. The presence
of N was confirmed in the case of all the catalysts. From figure 5b, it was confirmed that the N
content decreased as the proportion of the Fe dopant was increased. On the other hand, as the
amount of the Fe dopant was increased, the proportion of Fe increased in the case of sample
