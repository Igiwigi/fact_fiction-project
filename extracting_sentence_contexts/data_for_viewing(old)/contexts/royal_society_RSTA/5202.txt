tensions of the tendons are due to the combined effect of the third-harmonic heave and pitch
motions, as the contribution of the third-harmonic surge motion is negligible. From figure 15b,c,
we can see that the natural pitch and heave frequencies are 3 x w,/R/g ~3 x 1.055 =3.165 and
3 x w/R/g~3 x 1.081 = 3.243, respectively, which may be slightly different from the undamped
natural frequencies in table 2. At o/R/g* 1.055, the maximum amplitude of kac / pgAR? is
about 0.5, while that of ke) /pgAR? is about 0.05. Thus the contribution to the tensions of
the tendons at this frequency mainly comes from the pitch motion. As a result, the third-

harmonic tensions of tendons one and two both show a maximum around ,/R/g ~ 1.055. At : 2
o,/R/g ~ 1.081, which is related to the heave resonance, the maximum amplitude of ke) /pgAR? : 7
is about 0.19, while that of kag? / pgAR? is about 0.14. Thus, the contributions to the tensions : S
of the tendons from the heave and pitch motions are comparable. This means that the peak in : =
heave does not automatically lead to a peak in the tensions. In fact, due to the combined effect D8
of heave and pitch, the second local peak of the tension occurs at w,/R/g * 1.078 for tendon : oe
one and w,/R/g ~ 1.085 for tendon two, slightly away from the heave resonant frequency at : RS
o,/R/g ~ 1.081. We may also note from figure 16b that there is a local trough at ,/R/g ~ 1.074 : S
for tendon two. This is because the amplitudes of ke / pgAR? and kag) / pgAR? are comparable : 5

but their phases are almost opposite one another for tendon two, which leads to the partial
cancellation in the tension.

5. Conclusion

A higher order BEM has been used to investigate the resonance of a floating TLP generated
by the third-harmonic force in nonlinear regular waves. The comparison of the surge added
