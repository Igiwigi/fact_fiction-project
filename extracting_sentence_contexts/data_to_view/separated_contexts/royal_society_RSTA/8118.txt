That is to say,
every disturbance will ultimately disappear. Atiempt to Deduce Stability from Korrewsne’s Theorem.

3. Although this argument is not admissible (because the boundary conditions do not
require either ¢ or 6¢/én to vanish), the fact that U does not appear in (3) seemed at one
time to indicate that a proof of stability could be based on this equation. When the
boundaries are fixed (so that U = 0), Korrewsa’s theorem* asserts that the vorticity
integral tends always to decrease, whatever the type of the disturbance, provided that
this is sufficiently small to justify neglect of the second-order terms in the equations of motion. But equation (3), which holds for disturbances of any magnitude, indicates that the increase
or decrease of the vorticity integral turns solely upon the type of the disturbance (which

determines the sign of \j Cv*t da dy), and does not depend either upon the scale of
the disturbance or upon the magnitude of U.
