SAHS induces sudden surges in
sympathetic and vagal cardiac activity [55] as well as in NREM EEG 6 activity [33] and, as a result,
suppresses the nocturnal rhythmic physiological shifts in the sympathovagal balance. In turn, this
suppression likely induces a weakened autonomic control of the heart and brain rhythms and
may thus explain their higher complexity, which we measured in this study in terms of markedly

reduced values of full and self-predictability. : =

After long-term CPAP treatment, the differences in full and self-predictability observed in : yy
SAHS patients compared with healthy controls were maintained for the cardiac dynamics (3
(figure 2) and disappeared for the 5 and @ brain dynamics (figure 4). A factor that may contribute : S
to the restoration of the predictability of the brain dynamics is the fact that in this group of 22
SAHS patients the duration of REM sleep, which was significantly lower before the CPAP : 8
treatment, increased to values comparable to those of the healthy controls after the treatment DN
[38]. Because the slow wave EEG activity was found to be much more irregularly affected : g
by apnoeas during NREM sleep compared with REM [33], the restoration of REM duration ig

favoured by the treatment may be helpful to restore also the complexity of the dynamical
structure of the EEG waves. In contrast, the absence of any difference in all sleep parameters
between treated patients and controls, documented in reference [38], was not sufficient to
recover the drop in complexity of the dynamics of the HF component of HRV (see figure 2,
showing that the drop in complexity documented by lower predictability of n for SAHS was
not restored after CPAP).
