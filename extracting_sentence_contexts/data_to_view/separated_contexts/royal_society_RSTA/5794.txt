However, de Sitter space is really
different to Minkowski space in certain quantum aspects, see below. It also plays a fundamental
role as possible asymptotic states of more general homogeneous cosmologies (see later sections
below). In fact, there are two ‘de Sitter’ spaces, one for A positive—the de Sitter space (dS)—and the
case of negative 4, the so-called anti-de Sitter space (AdS) (see [10] for an excellent discussion of
these spaces, and [11] for a more specialized description of their infinity properties). Perhaps the simplest way to distinguish dS from AdS universes is that dS, like Schwarszchild
spacetime but unlike AdS, has a horizon separating its static regions from its evolutionary ones. This was not clear initially, but it later became understood with the work of Eddington and
Lemaitre.
