Another spherule is actually in the nucleus, but showing a
very obvious spatial relation to the spherules in the cytoplasm. In addition to the spatial relation which the nucleolar spherules are thus seen to
frequently bear to those in the cytoplasm, the nucleolar origin of the latter is also
indicated by their arrangement in the cytoplasm. It is difficult on any other
supposition to account for their arrangement in small groups, irregularly scattered
round the nucleus; and this arrangement, together with the fact that they are
never found in a peripheral position, and that there are, at this stage of the egg’s
growth, no cells in relation to the egg’s periphery, exclude the possibility of an
extracellular origin. The fact that the spherules are of much the same size in the
youngest as in older oocytes, and that groups of very small spherules are rarely,
if ever, seen, exclude both a cytoplasmic origin and a mode of origin by diffusion
through the nuclear membrane. Tt should also be noted that the groups in the cytoplasm show no relation to the
distal ends of the radially-arranged chromatin strands, and moreover continue to
appear after this arrangement of the chromatin has been lost.
