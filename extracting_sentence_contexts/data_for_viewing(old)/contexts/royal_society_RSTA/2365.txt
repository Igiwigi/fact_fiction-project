dependence on the ion mass was observed, with smaller ions like OH~ and CH? exhibiting
1/e decays between 600s and 300s. In any case, these lifetimes were found to be long enough
to permit simple infrared-active ions to cool rotationally and to eventually populate only their
lowest quantum states.

3. Cooling of internal degrees of freedom

When magnetic storage rings started to be used for electron recombination studies with molecular
ions [6-8], they offered a number of advantages over the use of traditional plasma and afterglow
methods. Firstly, the ions were mass-selected and the experiments measured the recombination
products directly, practically eliminating impurities or mistakes in ion identification. Secondly,
the high-energy merged beams approach allowed for energy-resolved measurements with
unprecedented resolution. The final and possibly most significant advantage was the fact that
the ions were typically stored for several seconds before the actual recombination experiment
was initiated. During those initial seconds in many cases, all vibrational excitations—which were
known to impact the recombination rate—would decay completely and leave a coasting beam of
molecular ions in their vibrational ground state.

With a few exceptions [9,10], the rotational state of the molecules was neglected in most of the
early measurements and has only come into focus for studies of a handful of important ions like
Hy [11-15], HDT [16] and D3O0* [17]. While the room-temperature radiation field in the magnetic
storage rings would typically result in a distribution of several rotational states, the comparatively
short storage times (typically of the order of 10s) often would not have allowed for full relaxation
into equilibrium in any case.
