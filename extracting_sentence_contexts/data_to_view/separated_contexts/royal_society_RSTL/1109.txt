In this whole space, wherever the precipice is accurately
perpendicular, the several strata are easily distinguished from
each other, but where the slightest obliquity prevails, a grassy
covering is formed that effectually conceals all beneath it ;
hence the face of the precipice seems much diversified;
the columnar strata in some places only exhibiting detached
groups of pillars, while in others they form extensive colon-
nades. I 5hall now state the appearances as we approach, and coast
the promontory from the westward, noticing in this first view
of the precipice, every thing that may be considered as gene-
ral, and reserving ( as I did with you) for my return in the con-
trary direction, a detailed account of the strata taken sepa-
rately. The first circumstance, that occurs to the attentive ob-
server on his approach, is, that although both the promon-
tory itself, and the strata composing it, ascend to the north-
ward, yet it is not in the same angle, the strata being more
inclined to the horizon than the line tracing the surface
of the promontory, a fact which I shall account for afterwards.

From the Black Rock to the Grant's Causeway (about a mile)
the materials, and their arrangement, are similar to those of
the coast to the westward, viz. strata of table basalt, gene-
rally separated by thinner strata of a reddish substance. At the Grant's Causeway a new arrangement commences,
one of the little systems I have mentioned in other memoirs,
by the aggregate of which our coast is formed ; nature having
changed her materials, or their disposition, or both, every
two or three miles.
