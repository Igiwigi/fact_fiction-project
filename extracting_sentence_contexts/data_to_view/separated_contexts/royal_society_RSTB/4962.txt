The subsequent further division of these primitive
sensory epithelial patches into the various macule acustice is accompanied by a
corresponding division of the distal portion of the auditory neurencytium, which thus
ultimately gives rise to the various ramuli of the auditory nerve. This process has
already been observed and briefly recorded in a number of vertebrate embryos by
Cameron and MinnicAN (1910). These investigators consider that they have clearly
established the fact that “the breaking-up of the primitive auditory ganglion is a
necessary accompaniment of the process of resolution of the sense-epithelium patch
into its various macular areas” (op. cit., p. 118). With their observations it is obvious
that the results recorded in the present paper are in complete agreement. The final closure of the otocyst takes place just dorsal to the middle of the lateral

surface of the same region now occurs, thus producing the rudiment of the saccus
endolymphaticus.
