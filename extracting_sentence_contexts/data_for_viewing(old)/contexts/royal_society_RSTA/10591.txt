perpendicular to the vector to its vertex. This generator touches the sphere.
The condition that the fourth root may vanish reduces to

MIED=7E =O" 8 5 ry see ee ee OO

and requires m = 0 for a real function, and in this case the cone breaks into a pair
of planes, and the symbolic quartic degrades.

Admitting that T@-*e = 0 (for an imaginary function), it appears that the
generator —®7'e + xb~*e is common to the quadric and the sphere when four
roots are zero,

The preceding analysis establishes the fact that a real self-conjugate function —
belong to the classes, I,, I,, I;, IL, but not to I,.

A pe self-coniugate fontidtios cannot tickles to I, if its two united points are
real, for certain of the conditions of self-conjugation of the tetrahedron in the
limit require Sa? = Sab =S)? = 0, or the line a, b must be a generator of the
sphere ; and matters are not changed when we assume @ and b to be conjugate
imaginaries. We conclude therefore that no self-conjugate function belongs to I;.

Since self-conjugate functions of the type II, exist, d fortiori they will exist for
the less restricted types IT,, II,, II.

Self-conjugate functions may belong to the types IIT,, IIT,. and to type IV, the
