that time or was produced by warping at a later date.

About | mile south of the point where the Basement Complex appears from beneath
the grits one finds a number of sections that appear to show that the latter have been
folded. The structure was found to be essentially the same at a number of points, and
the section shown (fig. 4) therefore serves to illustrate any section drawn from east to
west over a distance of several miles of the escarpment. It can be seen that whereas the
westward-dipping beds appear from a distance to be members of a tilted block, they
could in fact be the limb of a fold of which the axis lies almost over the foot of the
present escarpment. Near the crest of the fold a disturbance of the deposits, together
with evidence of past fumarolic action, seemed to indicate the existence of a fracture,
At one point there was also a thin upstanding ridge of rock which was, in the field,
