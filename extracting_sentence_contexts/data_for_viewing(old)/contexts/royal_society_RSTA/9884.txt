calcium salt.

From the curve of the very dilute solutions the value at infinite dilution will be
seen to lie between 0Â°076 and 0:098.

Theoretical Considerations.

From the foregoing conductivity results it will be seen that both the calcium and the
strontium solutions are fair conductors of electricity, yet if we judge from the osmotic-
pressure experiments alone, the calcium salt should show no appreciable dissociation,
while the strontium salt shows that there must even be some association.

A tentative explanation of these facts may be based on either of two hypotheses :

(1) that the salts in solution are associated* into double molecules, and these are
ionised, or (2) that the salts are ionised single molecules, and the ions are themselves
aggregated into larger complexes.
