eT emperatures can thus be well equalised before dilution takes place.

2b The following record describes work extending from October, 1912, to December,

a 1914. The accurate determination of heat of dilution is necessarily a tedious business,

3 owing to the fact that only one observation can be taken in an ordinary working day
of six hours.

> Measurement of Temperature.

= In most of the previous researches on heat of dilution a mercury thermometer was
E employed. Here temperature changes were measured with certainty by a platinum
aa ~y thermometer with fundamental interval of 12°8 ohms—mounted in a very thin-
8 walled cylindrical bulb, whose length is not far short of the depth of the solution.
vane experience with the working of this thermometer in other researches and
% careful application of all the corrections peculiar to it, enable the author to guarantee
