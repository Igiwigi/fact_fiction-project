sometimes from our want of knowledge, but often also from our inability to rightl
interpret the known facts, which are only too frequently few in number, and serv
rather to indicate the wide fields of knowledge yet to be searched than to furni
materials from which to draw definite conclusions. The organisation of the Ptero
sauria presents us with some of these difficulties.

The comparisons which have been made will, I think, make it clear that the
Pterosaurian skull, as shown in Scaphognathus Purdont, has a very close affinity to
the skulls of Lacertilia in important points of structure, while the resemblances to
the Avian skull are only superficial, On the other hand, the brain of S. Purdoni
departs from the Reptilian type, and makes an approach towards the brain of Birds,
and more especially to the form found in the fossil Hesperornis and its allies. Accep-
ting these facts, about which there can be no doubt, the Pterosauria show close
affinities with both Birds and Reptiles. From an evolutionistâ€™s point of view, this
seems to be just what would be expected; and one is inclined to say at once, Here
is the link connecting the two Sauropsidan groups. If Birds are modified and more
highly developed Reptiles, the Pterodactyl was surely the intermediate stage, or, in
other words, the Pterodactyl was the direct ancestor of the Bird. Is this really
the case? I think not. The brain of S. Purdoni might, indeed, be taken as inter-
mediate between that of Birds and of Reptiles, and it certainly makes such a near
approach to the brain of Hesperornis that one cannot but recognise their close affinity.

With regard to the skull of S. Purdoni, however, it seems to me, it 1s as truly
Reptilian as that of any Lizard living at the present day, and cannot therefore be said
to be intermediate between Reptiles and Birds. It may be argued that all parts of
