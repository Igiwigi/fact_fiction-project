Bawden (1936) has described this
phenomenon in some detail. If the shoots are infected they are completely so, and
show no amelioration of symptoms such as has been described by Botjes (1934). This
doubtless is due to the fact that the original infection is the result of a single virus and
not a complex. From a single tuber it is not uncommon to find one shoot healthy, and
a second from another eye diseased. Infected plants are invariably stunted in their growth; the leaves, as soon as they
unfold, display innumerable necrotic foci which appear under the upper epidermis
and at first do not penetrate throughout the thickness of the lamella.
