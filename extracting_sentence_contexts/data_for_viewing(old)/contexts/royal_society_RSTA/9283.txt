with rather more than two volumes of hydrogen, the variable and carefully measured
excess over two volumes being sufficient in quantity to ensure a residue of hydrogen
being left after synthesis. The gases were measured consecutively in the same
apparatus. By working with hydrogen in excess, the possibility of the formation of
such substances as ozone, hydrogen peroxide, or oxide of mercury, should be diminished
or eliminated.

The final operation was to estimate the hydrogen residue, when the combining
volumes could be calculated.

For measuring the gases at 0° C., and 760 mm. pressure, the method was the same
as that used by Gray and Burr(") for the volumetric analysis of hydrogen chloride.
In fact, some parts of the original apparatus were kindly lent to us by Dr. Gray.
The measuring pipette (fig. 4) consisted of a thick-walled glass bulb, A, of about
300 ¢.c. capacity, sealed to capillary tubes at either end of its vertical diameter.
The lower capillary expanded into the dead-space, B, which was furnished with a
glass point. The upper capillary, after a right-angle turn, led to the 3-way tap, C.
The pressure of gas in the bulb was registered by the vertical distance between the
mercury surface in the dead-space and the mercury surface in the upper chamber, D,
of the manometer, which communicated with the dead-space as shown in the figure.
The upper chamber of the manometer, of the same diameter as the dead-space
