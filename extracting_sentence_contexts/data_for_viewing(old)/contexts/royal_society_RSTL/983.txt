« 7, The consequence of this is, that there will be idle Re axes, or © dif-
ferent points of compensation for the differently coloured rays.

<«« 8, All these effects may be calculated with the utmost accuracy, if the ratio of
the dispersive powers of the two extraordinary refractive forces is given, or vice versd,
the dispersive powers may be obtained from the angles of the resultant axes for the
red and violet rays of the spectrum,

« g. I have found crystals in” which theze phenomena are decidedly connected
with the rotatory phenomena; and from this highly important fact I am led to
conclude, that borh have the same origin, and that all the rotatory phenomena are,
as T have $tated in my paper, the result of the uncompensated tints of two axes,
equal for the mean ray, but unequal for all the rest. (Here follows an illustration
by a diapbragm.)

« 10, The division into two classes in iii. as founded merely on observation, is
converted into another division into two classes, viz. 1. That in which the doubly
refracting force of the principal axis acts more powerfully on the blue rays than the
other axis does ; and 2, That in which it acts less powerfully. The first class com-
prehends those crystals in which the blue ends are inwards, and the second those in
which the red ends are inwards, or nearer the principal axis,”
