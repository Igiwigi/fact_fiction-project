Recently, a further improvement to the JKR theory was suggested in the works by Popov and : =
his collaborators [24,25]. Similar to Borodich [1], it was shown that the derivative of the total 1B
energy of an adhesive contact produces two terms that vanish and a product of some expression : =

were able to develop formulae that allowed explicit transformation from the solutions to largely : 3
arbitrary axisymmetric non-adhesive contact problems to the JKR-type solutions of the adhesive : s
problems. In fact, those formulae made a number of semi-analytical models of adhesive contact : S
redundant, for instance, Finite-Element Method (FEM)-based approaches [26-28] developed to 1s

describe adhesive contact between a rigid indenter and an elastic layer of finite thickness by
means of introducing correction factors into the classical JKR relations for elastic half-spaces.

The above mentioned approach [24,25] contains a priori assumptions, such as constant contact
stiffness during the virtual ‘unloading’ stage. Those assumption are required to reach the true
configuration of the system in the JKR approach. By contrast, here the same problems are studied
without employment of any assumptions concerning the mathematical form of the involved
force-displacement relations, assuming only the validity of the JKR formalism, i.e. the validity
of the superposition principle of the contact problems for axial symmetric problems. See §2a
