The mean of these experiments gives the ratio of the oxygen in the peroxide com-
pared with the Joss, as 858 : 1703, or as 100 : 1984, They clearly prove that the
reaction is as I have stated. The quantity of iodine taken varies from 2 to 20 equiva-
lents. The number of these experiments may appear superfluons, but there were some
cireumstances connected with the reaction when a smaller quantity of iodine was em-
ployed, which caused me particularly to inquire whether any excess of iodine would
alter its nature. It is plain that this cannot be done. I have also ascertained the
fact, that with a perfectly pure peroxide an equivalent of jodine always decomposes
exactly an equivalent of the peroxide, s0 that if an excess of the peroxide be taken it
remains undecomposed. In this important point this reaction differs from the other
experiments I have given, in which very small quantities of the substance decom-
pose the whole of the peroxide present. With iodine this will not take place.

The decomposition of the chloride of silyer by the peroxide of barium is a true
link between these experiments with iodine and the reduction of the metallic oxides.
In whatever rational form we may express these facts, the facts themselves are the
8ame. We cannot see the mode in which the action is effected, nor for the present
argument is it at all important whether we consider, as we reasonably may, that the
