76 DR. J. W. NICHOLSON ON OBLATE SPHEROIDAL

The analysis of this problem is now sufficiently developed for our purpose, which,
so far as the present problem is concerned, is rather to develop the requisite analysis
of the subject than to elucidate the physics of one special problem in complete detail.
We do not therefore examine the stream lines, whose equation follows at once from
the Fourier-Bessel formula.

§13. A Reciprocal Theorem.
We note that the harmonic (spheroidal) series for ¢/ is symmetrical in e/a and ¢,—
a fact not readily foreseen. ‘This gives us an interesting reciprocal property. On the
axis, where p= 1, 2=a%, or € =z/a. Consider two problems concerning the same
disc, one with a source at —c and the other with one at —c’. ‘ The effect of the dise
is equal at —e’ in the first case and —c in the second.’*

§14. Electrical Applications.

In the present section we obtain the exact solution, by the preceding methods, of
several hitherto analytically unsolved problems of electricity which are concerned with
the circular disc. In each case, no exhaustive discussion of the solutions from a physical
standpoint—which could be supplied at once by various modes of approximation in
the majority of cases—has been included, largely from considerations of space. Such
