the balance,—such as a common cylindrical conductor,—since we have merely to
discover the respective quantities abstracted. In eyery case of this kind the effect of
contact with a plate and sphere of equal area will be found the same. We may also
reverse the former experiment, and connect the plate with the fixed disc instead of
one of the spheres, and s0 examine the decreased intensity of the plate after contact
with the sphere or with a similar plate.

On referring to columns N ; b, M; b', M', &e. of Table VII., we observe one of those
cases in which the force is nearly in an inverse ratio of the distance, the distance 23
and 48 being as 1:2 nearly, whilst the corresponding forces 23 and 12 are nearly
as 2:1.

30. This simple induction of facts appears sufficiently conclusive ; it clearly shows
that a spherical conductor, either hollow or solid, and a plate of equal area, have the
same electrical capacity, and that CouLomse's experiments are not opposed to such a
conclusion.

31. We may now proceed to consider the case of an insulated body plunged within
an electrified sphere, and this will necessarily lead to some further inquiries into the
action of the proof plane, and to the conditions under which one substance receives
electricity from another.

The curious fact that we do not abstract any portion of the charge accumulated on
a hollow sphere by touching its interior surface with an insulated neutral disc placed
wholly within it, will, on inquiry, be found little conclusive of the non-existence of
