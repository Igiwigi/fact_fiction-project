stomach with the pleats, towards the lower part of the slice, â€˜spreads out laterally into two
parenchymatous sheets. These curve backwards, run alongside, and merge into some of the
lower anterior longitudinal muscles. Towards the upper part of the slice it similarly spreads
out into quite independent sheets which, however, curve forwards and merge into anterior
longitudinal muscles higher up in the series. Now it is possible that when the dorsal
longitudinal muscles are in contraction this brings together these sheets and that in this
way they form a barrier cutting off the rostral sinus above from the prosomal space below.
If so, then when the animal is actively casting, a valve would occur diverting the blood from
the blood pump into the peduncular vessel. I merely describe this as something which
looks possible from the structure, and even probable, but I have no direct evidence for it.
If a specimen were obtained which had been fixed instantaneously with the body cast out
of the mantle, then the arrangement of the parenchymatous sheets would show whether
they did in fact close the opening into the prosoma and act as a barrier. Unfortunately
however, in all well-fixed specimens the body is withdrawn into the mantle.

The histological constitution of these sheets is interesting. They are undoubtedly paren-
chymatous, arising in continuity with the main gut parenchyma and the parenchyma
running along the dorsal muscles. But the cells are so stretched out that the sheets look
at first sight to be of a typical squamous epithelial constitution.


OF THE PEDUNCULATE BARNACLE LITHOTRYA 123

The passage of blood down the peduncular vessel and through the peduncular network
will not differ when the animal is casting from when it is at rest. When it returns to the
