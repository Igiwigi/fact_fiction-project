are primarily and uniformly unsegmented.*

2. From the morphological point of view, however, the most important conclusions
derived from the investigations recorded above are undoubtedly the following :—

a. The independent origin of the sympathetic system, and its secondary connexion
with the cerebro-spinal system.

b. Its development from the mesoblast.

_ Both these points are of interest, more particularly because, on the one hand, the
sympathetic system has previously been regarded as a specialised portion of the
general nervous system ; and, on the other hand, there is no fact in embryology more
firmly established than this, that whenever a nervous system is present, it is
developed from the epiblast.

As the foregoing observations are confined to Mammals—a highly specialised
group of vertebrates—it may be objected that, until other and more primitive groups
are investigated, it is unwise to draw conclusions of so general a nature. On the
other hand, I would venture to urge the following considerations :—

(1) In maintaining the independent and mesoblastic origin of the sympathetic, one
is supported by the investigations of a considerable number of embryologists (p. 161),
ineluding Remax, who studied the subject in the Chick, the main difference between
ReMak’s view of the development of the Avian sympathetic system and the observa-
