(a) Super- and sub-solution

Let u be a positive harmonic function in D, with zero boundary values on 9D N By.

(i) We say u is a super-solution at a free boundary point z if whether there is tangential inner
ball condition at z, then one has lim supp,,.,, |Vu|(x) <1.
(ii) A sub-solution is defined accordingly by using outer touching ball at z, and with the
property that lim infps,—.z |Vu|(x) > 1.
(iii) A viscosity solution is a function that is both super- and sub-solution.

The astute reader may already have noted that this definition is implicitly using the facts (1)-(2)
above, concerning the behaviour of positive harmonic functions near boundary points. Indeed,
the tangential inner ball condition for super-solutions is using the fact that the gradient is
asymptotically non-zero at such free boundaries, and the super-solution condition forces it to
stay below one. The latter in turn has a consequence that the free boundary is also smooth from
outside.

We shall here consider the case of Lipschitz free boundaries and then derive local Cl”
regularity. The main idea is to use the approach described in the section of minimal surfaces,

W71t should be remarked that in general there is no uniqueness for our problem, and solutions may cross each other.
Nevertheless, the solutions cannot have contact points between the free boundaries. This is an important ingredient in
constructing a continuous family of sub-solutions that are instrumental for improving the cone of monotonicity.
