Now this I think will be obtained, if
we can make it appear that stopping one sort of rays does not
necessarily bring on a stoppage of the other sort ; for, if it can
be shewn that heat and light are in this respect independent of
each other, it will follow that they must be occasioned by diffe-
rent rays; and I shall make all possible objections to- the ar-.
guments I mean to draw from these tables, in order to shew
that no hypothesis will evade the force of our conclusions. It has been noticed, that bluish-white and flint glasses stop
nearly three times as much heat as light ; whereas, crown glass
stops only about one-fourth more of the former than of the
latter. Now, in answer to this, it may be alleged, « that the
« ingredients of which the former glasses are made, dispose
« them probably to stop the invisible rays of heat, and that
« consequently a great interception of it may take place, with-
« out bringing on a necessity of stopping much light ; and that,
«< on the other hand, the different texture of crown glass may
« stop one sort of heat as well as the other, so that nearly an
« equality in this respect may be produced.”

When a hypothesis is made in order to explain any phezno-
menon of nature, we ought to examine how it will agree with
other facts; and, in this case, we are already furnished with ex-
periments, which are decidedly against the supposition that has
been brought forward. For, the 148th and 149th experiments
shew that the bluish-white and flint glasses transmit all, or nearly
all, the invisible rays of solar heat; whereas crown glass, by
the 150th experiment, stops a considerable number of them. But, to assist the objecting argument, let it be alleged, as has
been proved by the 94th experiment, that our bluish-white
glass stops a considerable portion of the heat that goes with the

red rays; then, if the 86 rays of light which this glass stops,
are supposed to be all of that sort, the heat which will be
stopped in consequence, will, according to the experiment we
have mentioned, amount to 86 multiplied by ,375, that is, 32
rays of heat ; but, since 250 have been stopped, there will.
remain 218 to be accounted for.
