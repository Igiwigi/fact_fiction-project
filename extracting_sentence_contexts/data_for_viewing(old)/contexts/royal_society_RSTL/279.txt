V. On the elliptical coloured rings produced by depolarising
Crystals.

In a former work, to which I have already had occasion to
refer, I have given some account of the colours which accom-
pany the depolarisation of light, and I have particularly noticed
the remarkable fact, that when, a beam. of white depolarised
light is, transmitted through a doubly. refracting crystal, the.
red rays go to the formation of one. image, while the bluish
green rays go to the formation of the other image, In re-
peating and extending these experiments, I have been led into
a new field of inquiry which has already afforded a series of
instructive results deduced from a class of phenomena un=
questionably the most brilliant within. the whole range of
optics.

The plate of topaz which was used in these experiments, is
