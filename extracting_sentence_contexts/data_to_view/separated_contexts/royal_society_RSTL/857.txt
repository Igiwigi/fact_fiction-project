AMAND also gave me part of a stone he had
preserved in his collection ever since the year 1790, when a
shower of stones, weighing from 4 an ounce to 15 and. 25
pounds each, fell in the parishes of Grange and Creon, and als»
in the-parish. of Juliac, in Armagnac; which fact was, at. the
time, verified: by Duzy, Mayor of Armile, and published by
BerTHoLON, in the Journal des Sciences utiles de Montpellier,
in the year 1790. The third specimen, I owe to the Marquis de DREE; it is a
fragment, broken from a stone of 22 pounds weight, which fell
near the village Salles, not far from Villefranche in Burgundy,
on the 12th of March, 1798; this was also accompanied by a
meteor.
