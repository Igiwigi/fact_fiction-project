Interestingly,
TENT4A S is evenly distributed throughout the cell, whereas
only a small fraction of TENT4A L could be found in the cyto-
plasm. Further analysis revealed that the N-terminal region is
crucial not only for nucleotidyltransferase activity but also for
the nuclear localization of TENT4A L [50]. In fact, on the
basis of ribosome profiling [51] and recent experimental work
by Lim et al. [52] it has been ascertained that TENT4A L pos-
sesses 20 amino acids more on its N-terminus than previously
annotated [50]. These, and an additional 10 N-terminal AAs
show strong conservation with the N-terminus of another
human Trf4p homologueâ€”TENT4B [52]. There are some
suggestions that TENT4A may be involved in pre-mRNA
maturation in the nucleoplasm, as TENT4A S was shown to
interact with a non-nucleolar protein PRPF31, which is necess-
ary for U4/U6-U5 tri-snRNP formation [53].
