of the densities indicated by these symbols,
and which, though now revealed to us through the numerical properties of chemical
equations only as * implicit and dependent existences,” we cannot but surmise may gome
day become, or may in the past have been, © isolated and independent existences.” Examples of these simple monad forms of material being are preserved to us in such
elements as hydrogen and mercury, which appear im the chemical system, as records
suggestive of a state of things different from that which actually prevails, but which has
passed away, and which we are unable to restore. Such a hypothesis is not precluded to us, but nevertheless we are not to imagine that
it is a necessary inference from the facts. So far as the principles or conclusions of this
method are concerned, the © simple weights” Z, 0, x, Þ, @, », ©, - . . may be treated purely
as * ideal” existences created and called into being to satisfy the demands of the intellect,
to enable us to reason and to think in reference to chemical phenomena, but destined to
vanish from the scene when their purpose has been served; and the existence of which
as external realities we neither assume nor deny.
