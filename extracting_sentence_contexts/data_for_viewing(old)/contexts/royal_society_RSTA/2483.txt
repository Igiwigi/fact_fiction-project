positive and negative electrode active materials, and/or (iii) decrease the dead weight of the cell
(separator, electrolyte, cell packaging, etc.). While significant progress was made over the last
decades in order to improve the cell engineering, the quest for new battery chemistries (anode
and cathode active materials) is advancing at a slower pace.

The ‘holy grail’ in the battery community is to build rechargeable cells using Li metal as an
anode. Indeed, being the lightest metal with a low standard potential (—3.04V versus normal
hydrogen electrode), it results in very high specific capacity (figure 1). Intensive research on
battery concepts based on lithium metal anodes such as Li-S and Li-air technologies have despite
large theoretical promise, proven many intrinsic issues related to safety, e.g. dendritic growth
of Li and mechanistic bottlenecks, e.g. polysulfide dissolution or reactivity of radicals to be
showstoppers [4-6]. Sodium metal, as lithium, has also a tendency to dendritic growth [7]. This
fact coupled to its relatively low melting point (approx. 98°C) makes it an even less safe anode.

However, magnesium or calcium seem to be less prone to dendrite formation, potentially due to
the lower self-diffusion barriers of the adatom during plating [8-10]. The use of these light metals
couples the advantages of high theoretical volumetric capacity (figure 1) with natural abundance,
low cost and safety. Furthermore, the use of divalent charge carriers accounts for a twofold
increase in achievable energy density with respect to Lit for equal amounts of reacted ions.
