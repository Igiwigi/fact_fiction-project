frame) is shown in bold. The introduction of active elements in the support structure allows

transfer of the control force to the hub without the generation of a reaction force in the flapwise
direction of the blade. In fact, the active elements produce forces that are external to the support
structure and hence nullify the forces in the flapwise direction (e.g. the net flapwise load at
joints A or B is identically zero). Hence, mechanistically, this eliminates any flapwise reaction
forces for the support structure if the algebraic condition ATo(t) sin(go) = AT) (t) sin(g1) shown
in figure 3 is met. The forces T,T},... are static prestressing forces in the cable. The control
force determines the value of ATo(t) and the other active tendon forces (such as AT}(t)) can be
calculated subsequently based on geometry and force equilibrium. The net control force acting on
the blade tip in the flapwise direction for the jth blade is given by

In the mathematical framework adopted in this study, the active control forces have been
modelled as external modal loads applied to each blade. The principle of virtual work is used
