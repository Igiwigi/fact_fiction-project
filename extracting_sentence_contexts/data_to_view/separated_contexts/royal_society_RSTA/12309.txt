Now this for all three
gases agrees with their behaviour as regards Boyur’s law at the pressures covered by
the experiments. It is well known that in the case of air and carbon dioxide the
imperfectness of the gases is revealed by departures from Boyte’s law, small in the
one ease, large in the other, but in the opposite direction to that which is apparent in
the case of hydrogen, whose deviation from the law is, as in the case of air, small. These facts, taken together, are, I think, a strong confirmation of the reality of the
