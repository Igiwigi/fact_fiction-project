where p(x, f) and v > 0 are the pressure and kinematic viscosity and p > 0 is the density. Dotting

Thus, a constraint on the mean power (f-u) can be regarded as a constraint on the mean
enstrophy (|Vu|?). Having found an optimal u, we can then simply read off from (1.2) the
corresponding optimal f. This is not to say that every optimal velocity is dynamically stable—
in fact, in related problems involving extremal orbits the opposite situation holds [41,42].
Nevertheless, to get started, we set aside the momentum equation henceforth and focus solely
on optimizing advection—diffusion.

Switching to non-dimensional variables, let x =R=1. The value of the mean enstrophy
(|Vul*), or the mean energy (|u|?) when we discuss it, will be called the Peclét number Pe as either
quantity sets the relative strength of advection to diffusion. (In dimensional variables, Pe = UR/«
with U being the imposed velocity scale.) In the advective limit Pe + oo, one expects to be able to
drive (|VT|*) > 0 along a well-chosen sequence of velocities. The question is: at what optimal rate


can this convergence occur? Our main result is a set of upper and lower bounds on min(|VT|?) 4 |
