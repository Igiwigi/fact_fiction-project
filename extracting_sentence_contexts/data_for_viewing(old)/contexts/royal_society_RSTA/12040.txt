Attention must be drawn to group 10 of the Great Arc. It contains one of
Lameron’s stations, Takalkhera, which Everest rejected, because he calculated that
the plumb-line is attracted 5” northwards at that point by the tablelands of the
Mahadeo Hills, which are 20 miles distant and rise about 1600 feet above it. But
the group contains four subsequently determined stations whose distances range from
20 to 28 miles to the south of Takalkhera, all which show a still larger amount of
northerly attraction. Here, therefore, there must be not only an excess of visible
matter above ground in the Mahadeo plateau to the north, but a deficiency of invisible
matter underground to the south.

It is only to the operation of underground variations of density that we can look for
an explanation of the fact that at Bombay there is apparently large northerly deflec-
tion, and at Madras there is large southerly deflection, while there is no visible
source of meridional attraction at either place. Whatever the uncertainty about the
actual deflection at each place because of the uncertainty at the origin, there is no
question that the astronomical amplitude of the arc Bombay—Madras is 16°01 less
than the (corrected) geodetic amplitude, mainly because of the local deflections at the
two places, the difference being at least twenty times greater than can be due to
error in the triangulation. There is no apparent cause to which to attribute these
gross deflections. Others of a like nature are presented by the latitude observations
