Numerical integration

For the calculation of the mean magnetization at a given value of h of an assembly of
ellipsoids orientated at random in the field (see table 6, § 4), the value of the integral in

(2:19) is required, namely

cos ¢ = {""cos¢ sin 0d. (3-3)

From table 2, giving cos ¢ as a function of h at a series of values of @, tables may be drawn up
giving (cos ¢), for @ = 0 (10°) 90°, and a series of equally spaced values of the integrand
obtained by multiplying by sin @. Where the integrand is a continuous function of @ over
the range of integration, that is for | h| <3, for }<h<1, and for | h| >1, the integration can
in principle be effected numerically, using the Newton-Gregory formula, or, if the con-
tinuation of the function outside the @ range from 0 to 90° is known and is of a suitable
character, the more convenient central difference formula. For |h| <4, the integration can in
fact be effected with the required accuracy with the intervals in 0 as large as 10°, but smaller
intervals (5 or 25°) are required for }<h<1, and also for | 4| greater than, and close to 1. (The difficulties arise from the behaviour of the differences of the integrand as # approaches
90°, the general character of which can be appreciated, without detailed description, from
the forms of the curves in figures 4 and 5.) For || = 1, accurate integration by this method
is virtually impracticable, since for 690°, (d$/d0) >—oo.
