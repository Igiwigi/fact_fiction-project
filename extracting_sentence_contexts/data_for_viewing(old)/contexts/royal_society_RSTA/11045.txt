The 1841-96 and 1865-96 data in Table III. present some conspicuous differences ;
a is larger in the former series than in the latter in every single month of the year,
but 6 shows exactly the opposite phenomenon in 9 months out of the 12. This

implies a very conspicuous difference between the phenomena in years prior and
subsequent to 1864. Not improbably the want of homogeneousness in the earlier
data, already referred to, may be partly accountable for the apparent change. At all
events, the results for the final period, 1889-96, show no distinct progressive
diminution of @ or increase of b as compared to the period 1865-96. In fact, the
“all” day data for these two periods, and the “quiet” day data for the shorter
period, give almost identical values for the mean b for the year.

As regards the seasonal phenomena, each set of Greenwich data makes b con-
spicuously least, but b/a conspicuously largest, in “ winter.” The December value of
b is invariably the smallest. The “all” and “quiet” day data for 1889-96, as
already stated, give very nearly the same mean value of b for the year, but the
“quiet” days’ value for b is much the larger of the two in winter, and the smaller in
summer. The “quiet” day data at Greenwich present a remarkable similarity to
the corresponding Kew data, as is best seen by comparing the seasonal values for b/a.
The fact, however, that the absolute values of both a and b are some 10 per cent.
higher at Greenwich than at Kew is rather suggestive of some misapprehension as to
