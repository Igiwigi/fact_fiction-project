Those
at z are bounded by planes parallel to-A zy, A 23,47 2» as those at A are by the
planes which meet at A, If the crystal be. divisible according to all the planes of
a tetrahedron or octahedron, there are four different kinds of parallelepiped of
which it may, be conceived to be composed, corresponding to the four angles A, x,
9, z. And we may take anyone of these kinds with equal propriety. In fact, the
mode of conceiving secondary planes to be formed by removing parallelepipeds, is
an assumption to be considered right only $0 far as it exhibits the dependence of
Secondary planes upon the simplicity of the ratios p: + r.

+ If we suppose A zy z to be made up of parallelepipeds, A z, Ay, and A z having
equal numbers of them, planes parallel to zy z will pass through all their angles. And if instead of parallelepipeds, we suppose that we have only points in space
where the angles of the parallelepipeds would be, the planes which are determined
by any adjacent three points will be the four planes, Azy, Azz, Ayz,7 95.

and their symbols are (p; 9; 7), (p; Þ—q; p—?)-
Also the edges Ay, Azare symmetrical ; and hence we have
two other co-existent planes (p; 7; q) (Þ—r: þ—9)
These are included in the formula { Þ3 4.7) (pi p—4q, p—1)}
The solid angles at y and z are also symmetrical ; and. a
plane being supposed to be formed at y as before, we must
have a co-existent plane at z.
