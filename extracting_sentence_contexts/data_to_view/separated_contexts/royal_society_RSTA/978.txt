These multiple boundary conditions are unusual and non-trivial constraints on the design of the
basis set that are not yet fully understood, and will be the most challenging part of using the
RmatReact methodology for reactive collisions. We will thus defer its consideration to §3. We
should, however, be reassured by the fact that this type of approach has been successfully used
in light-particle reactive collisions, e.g. where positron—atom reactants react to positronium—ion
products [30,31].

(iii) Scattering theory: describing the outer region using channels and reduced radial functions

The close-coupling equations [43] also simplify the full Schrédinger equation; instead of
separating based on the rotational and vibrational wave function, the wave function in the
scattering coordinate (the reduced radial function) is separated from the other components of
the wave function, which are described as channels in standard close-coupling treatments. Non-reactive scattering. The wave function is given in terms of channels and the reduced radial

function, F, as
channels

where the definition of F is by convention, c goes over all channel functions and &, are the channel
functions with all necessary coordinates orthogonal to r2.
