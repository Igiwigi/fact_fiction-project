During the first of these an equivalent number of C. albiceps larvae is present initially in
each series. It is indicated by the first point on the chart. There is no difference in the final
population of flies or in the production of progeny, and the presence of Lucilia in the mixed
population has not affected the issue. The second period extends to the point at which the
two curves cross each other, represented by the co-ordinates of 65 larvae and 250 eggs/g.
Over the range so covered, the pure culture of C. albiceps can produce very many more
potential progeny than can be produced by the mixed populations—at the peaks of produc-
tion in each case there are more than twice as many. The presence of Lucilia has had
a detrimental effect upon the population of C. albiceps, in spite of becoming largely destroyed
itself.

This effect is not due to any increased reduction in the general size of the individuals
comprising the population—in fact, at this juncture the surviving C. albiceps individuals are
generally larger than those produced in pure cultures—but to a reduction in the numbers
of C. albiceps survivors. Reduction in size takes place in a normal manner and occurs
concurrently with an increase in mortality as observed previously.

During the third period, where overcrowding on the medium becomes still more severe,
the positions of the two curves are interchanged. With approximately 65 larvae/g. in each
of the initial populations, the two series give rise to an equal number of progeny. There is
a larger survival value coupled with a smaller general size in the mixed population. With
further degrees of overcrowding C. albiceps in the mixed population produces considerably
more eggs per gram of medium from the same initial population mass than does C. albiceps
in pure culture. Lucilia larvae are eliminated at an early stage.
