more centrally placed, there are very many cigar-shaped nuclei (nucâ€™). The chromatin
of the latter is distributed as fine granules and there is no nucleolus present. The
cigar-shaped nuclei are only to be found in those parts of the gut in which there is

developed an extensive neurofibrillar plexus, and one is prompted to suggest, there-
fore, that some, at least, of them represent the nuclear elements of the sensory cells
of the gut epithelium. This suggestion is only made in view of the fact that,
although no direct evidence has been obtained of the presence of sensory elements
within the gut wall, their presence may be inferred on account of the development
of a basal fibrillar plexus. This being so, the nuclei of the sensory elements should
be visible in preparations which show, in all other respects, excellent fixation. The
rounded nuclei correspond to the rounded nuclei of other parts of the body both in
form and number, while the cigar-shaped bodies similarly correspond to the nuclei
of the primary sense cells of the general ectoderm (fig. 8B, s.c.). There are excellent
a priori grounds for the suggestion that we have here the visible signs of the presence
of numerous sensory elements. Their presence would, indeed, not be unsuspected
in an evaginable part of the gut which is capable of being wrapped round the prey
during the process of digestion.
