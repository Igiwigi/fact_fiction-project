Conditional regularity

Strong solutions have many good properties in addition to their uniqueness. For example, if a
solution is strong on [0, T], i.e. once we know that the enstrophy is finite for all t € [0, T], then the
solution is actually smooth for all t € (0,T], so for all 0 <t < T the equations are satisfied in the
classical sense (see Theorem 10.6 in [4], Ch. 7 of [5], or Section 6 in [3]). In fact, in the periodic
case, such a solution is even analytic, see [25]. This motivates the search for other ‘conditional’ regularity results: given a weak solution u
starting from smooth initial data, what additional properties will ensure that it is in fact a smooth
solution? The statement that a strong solution is smooth can be interpreted in this light, where the
‘additional property’ of the weak solution is that its enstrophy is bounded.
