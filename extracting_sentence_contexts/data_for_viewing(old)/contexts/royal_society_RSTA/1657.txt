need to accurately reproduce this in the synthetic spectra for the atmospheric model output by
the algorithm to give confidence that the presence of the wave in the atmosphere is retained. To
isolate the perturbed profiles from the unperturbed profiles, we found the time steps and locations
that the upwardly propagating wave from the original simulations passed through the height of
formation of the 6301 A and 6302 A line pair. We took this as an optical depth of log, t = —0.5 to
—1.5, as studies suggest that this is roughly the region where the line forms [70]. We took a range
of optical depths to account for the fact that the optical depth is likely to vary in different regions
of the tube and in the presence of the wave. Taking a range of optical depths ensures that we catch
the propagation of the wave as it passes through that region of the atmosphere. Then we applied
similar methods to profiles that were deemed as perturbed by the passage of the wave and those
that were deemed unperturbed.

For the 1000G simulations, the R? value was 0.86 + 0.12 for the Stokes-I spectra deemed to be
perturbed and 0.75 + 0.17 for the unperturbed Stokes-I spectra, while the NSE value was found
to be 0.88 + 0.15 and 0.72 + 0.30 for the perturbed and unperturbed Stokes-I profiles, respectively.
The R? value for the corresponding Stokes-V spectra for the 1000G simulation was 0.75 +0.19
and 0.66 +0.18 for the perturbed and unperturbed spectra, respectively. The NSE value for the
perturbed Stokes-V spectra was calculated as 0.82 + 0.13 while the unperturbed Stokes-V spectra
had an NSE value of 0.88+0.10. Note, table 2 summarizes the R* and NSE values for the
