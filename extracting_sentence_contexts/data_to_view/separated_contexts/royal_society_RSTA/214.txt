Ficure 13, A comparison of beach gradients predicted from the calculator
and gradients determined by ground survey. DEPTHS AND EXTINCTION COEFFICIENTS OF SHALLOW WATER 207

calculated from brightness profiles, nor could any reasonable correction for haze produce
a significant increase in the red extinction coefficients.

(ii) Non-homogeneity of the water. Samples taken at greater depths and at greater
distances from the shore gave in fact somewhat higher extinction coefficients in the Pulfrich
photometer than those recorded in table 8.

(iii) Errors in survey. It would require a 4 ft. error in a 6 ft. sounding to explain the
discrepancy. (iv) Random photographic errors.
