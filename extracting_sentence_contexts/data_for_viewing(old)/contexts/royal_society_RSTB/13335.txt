As this diversity demonstrates, studying psychological sys-
tems is potent for understanding how features of human
cognition fashion culture. But scholars have overlooked at least
one additional set of capacities: the subjective psychological cri-
teria involved in evaluations [135,136]. Evaluation crucially
contributes to the development of much of culture. People
often selectively copy and retain variants they evaluate as serving
their goals, over time resulting in increasingly compelling cul-
tural traditions. Still, mechanisms for evaluating causal
