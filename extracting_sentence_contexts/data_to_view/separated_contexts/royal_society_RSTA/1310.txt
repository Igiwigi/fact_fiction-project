Even if the Nash equilibrium obtained in each case
is different it does not have a significant impact on the objective function. The mean objective
function across the population is €1649.58 in the perfect forecast case, and €1649.86, €1649.21,
€1648.99 for W = {0.1,0.2, 0.3}, respectively. Those values are very close, and this result should
be interpreted as the fact that changes in forecast uncertainty are mitigated by population effects
when it comes to population-average costs. In addition, the distributions have similar shapes and
quantiles, therefore, we can conclude that the effect of the forecast accuracy is mitigated by the
population effects in terms of cost, beyond the mean only, but not in terms of consumption. Recall
that the plot shows the mean consumption across the population, but the aggregated effect of this
small deviations has a significant impact on the system demand.

(d) Effect of bounded rationality

Finally, we relax the rationality assumption and study the impact of bounded rational agents on
the system equilibrium.
