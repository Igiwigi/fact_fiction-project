Although the genetic constitution of an organism
must be involved in every aspect of its morphological development, it now seems improbable
that the facts of stelar elaboration can be explained in terms of the theory of recapitulation. In these studies, some of the large, rapidly growing buds, which have been induced to
develop in the subapical region, may be solenostelic from the outset, with no antecedent
protostelic stage. The size and configuration of the stele, in fact, are directly related to the
size of the apical meristem and the latter to the nutritional status of the tissues with which
it is in organic continuity (Wardlaw 1945). A comprehensive study of pteridophytes has shown that the progressive elaboration of
the stele accompanies its increase in size. That there is such a size-structure correlation
may now be accepted as a fact (Bower 1921, 1930; Wardlaw 1947d).
