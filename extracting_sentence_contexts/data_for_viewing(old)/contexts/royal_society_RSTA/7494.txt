theorem 9, part IV, is a multiple of

(bip2S'| M | p2p2,D") = 0, (38)
and the second vanishes similarly. The third is a multiple of

(pip2D" | M | p2p,D").

In principle this could be evaluated by a WVQ expansion; in particular it is well known
and can be seen to have the same expansion coefficients as (p?D!| M | p?D'). All four con-
tributions have to be added together to give the value in table 11, and in actual fact this type
of integral is one of the most laborious to evaluate of those which are usually required for
variational problems.

The expansion of M,, need not be analyzed in detail. It differs from that of M,, only in
the d? replacing 3. Just the same /} expansion, the same changes of coupling and the same
removal are performed. Of the resulting six terms only the last does not vanish, since in
this case the first three terms vanish since the two non-coincidences cause the Vj), coeffi-
cients of fpÂ», d? to be zero.

The expansion of M,, will be described, and this will be considered sufficient to illustrate
the similar evaluations for M,, and Mgs, since they are obtained by exactly the same
changes of form and the resulting terms are slightly simpler. M,, is resolved into simpler
