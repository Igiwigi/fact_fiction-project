This is the reverse of what, arguing from general principles, we might have expected. The angles bom and bom) or rather their supplements have been added to the table
in order to discover whether they displayed any compensatory variation, but it is
sufficiently obvious that the two sets of angles vary independently. In children, as is well known, the occipital angles including those given above

are larger than in the adult, and this fact suggests that a clue to the difficulty
may perhaps be found by comparing the skulls of men as well as of anthropoid apes
in different stages of growth. Let us see if this is the case. The skull of a young
chimpanzee, No. 1 in the diagram (fig. 10), is more human than many men as regards
the magnitude of its exterior foramino-basal angles (vbor = 154° and opbom = 139°),
which are at least 8° greater than the corresponding angles in the South
Australian skull No. 993.
