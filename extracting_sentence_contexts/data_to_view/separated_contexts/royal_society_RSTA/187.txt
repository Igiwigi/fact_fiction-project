The question of wave-formation downstream

42. In both of Examples 7 and 8, the stream having passed the rigid barrier falls steadily
to the lower of the two levels which are associated, according to § 10, with any particular

rate of flow. We had expected to find solutions characterized by standing waves on the
downstream side, but none in fact was found. In view of solutions obtained by Rayleigh
(1883) and others, and which have been reviewed by Lamb (1932, §§ 242-5), this result
calls for some enquiry. :

Lamb (loc. cit.) remarks that in the absence of dissipative forces the problem is to some
extent indefinite, in that one can always superpose an endless train of stationary waves
having the wave-length appropriate to the stream-velocity; and that when the stream-depth
his finite there will be indeterminateness or not, according as the stream velocity c is less or
greater than /(gh).
