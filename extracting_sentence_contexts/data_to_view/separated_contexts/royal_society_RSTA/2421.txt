In the published derivation the plasma was assumed
to be cylindrical and so the elongated shape of the plasma was not included. Repeating the
derivation but including the shape characterized through the aspect ratio, A=Ro/a and the
elongation, «, we find
2 7/2

nT tp x ab () . (2.2)

The details of the derivation are given in appendix A. Here H = (TE) experiment / (TE) scaling is a
simple numerical factor included to allow for the fact that in experiments the actual confinement
time, (TE)experiment, can be above or below (TE) scaling: Typically H is in the range 0.8-2.0. The
parameter q = RoBrk. /A*lp is an operational parameter related to the pitch of the magnetic field
in the plasma and known as the ‘safety factor’. Experiments have shown that q must be kept >2.5
and so for a given device it is essentially a constraint on the maximum current that can be used.
