W. RICHARDSON ON THE IONISATION

platinum is smaller at high than at low pressures. Hence, if the pressure were
suddenly changed from a high to a low value, the leak at constant temperature
should be small at first and then gradually rise to a steady value, while suddenly
increasing the pressure should give rise to the converse effect. As a matter of fact,
the opposite of this is what has been observed in both cases, indicating that the

«“e

ionisation is proportional to the “combined” rather than to the “free” platinum, if
it is permissible to use these words ina rather wider sense than that usually understood
by the term chemical combination,

The other objection depends on the way in which the steady leak varies with the
pressure at low pressures. The preceding.view would make the leak directly
proportional to the pressure at’ low pressures at all temperatures, whereas the
experiments show that at low temperatures and pressures the leak varies as the
square root of the pressure. This result is also readily explained if we suppose the
ionisation to be proportional to the amount of combined or absorbed oxygen rather
than to the rate of chemical action between the oxygen and the platinum.
