The acts of aggression we observed arose

that recipients and aggressors showed the same, strongly spontaneously among familiar, same-aged birds that had

nonlinear change in temperature. This finding indicates been reared together since hatching, as is standard practice in

that, rather than acting as a stressor for one party but not the gamebird industry [89]. Captive pheasants are aggressive

the other, directed aggressive interactions may in fact towards one another within the first few weeks of life [65]

induce similar physiological responses in the aggressor and and dominance relationships can continue to change as males

the recipient, at least in the short term. Numerous other move into adulthood [90], so the behaviour we recorded

studies support this interpretation, suggesting that the likely represents the early emergence of a dominance hierarchy

vertebrate neuroendocrine ‘stress’ response (via the sym- that can ultimately shape their sexual success [64]. By contrast,

patho-adrenomedullary and HPA systems) actually reflects the resident-intruder paradigm commonly used in rodent

metabolic and cardiovascular demands associated with studies of aggression is a more controlled but contrived setting,

behavioural activity, rather than the rewarding or aversive where the intruder is forcibly exposed to an aggressive resident,

nature of the triggering stimulus [68,87].
