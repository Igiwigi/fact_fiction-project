Reducing the ordinates of his original curve by 4 we obtained a curve which touched
our curve, taken under the same circumstances, in the green, but dropped below it
considerably in the red, and very slightly in the blue-green. Fig. 5, Plate 24, gives
the two curves, the maximum of the normal curve being taken as 100. G's prin-
cipal defect is evidently in the red; in fact, when he matched the luminosity in the
part of the spectrum near C with the candlelight, to our eyes, the shadow illumined
by the spectrum was a brilliant red, whilst that illumined by the candle was nearly
black. There may be a very slight falling off in the blue-green, which on the
trichromatic theory can be accounted for by a light want of sensitiveness in the
