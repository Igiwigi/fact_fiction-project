certainly seems to be connected with the fact of the radial tubes being tracts of high
excitability. Now the latter fact, it seems to me, can only be accounted for in one of two
ways, Either (4) we must swppose the course of a radial tube to coincide with that of -
a chain of ganglionic elements, or else (5) we must snppose it to coincide with something
resembling a nerve-trunk—the latter being composed of aggregations of the afferent
lines which we have already supposed to constitute the rudimentary nerve-plexus.
According to the first of these snppositions, the comparatively high excitability of the
radial tubes, as well as the pointing of the polypite to the unsevered tube in a specimen
prepared as represented in fig. 8, would both be explained by the further supposition
that when such a ganglion chain is stimulated—either directly or by conduction of the
stimulus from a distance—the ganglionic elements discharge their influence, and 80 add
to the strength of the original stimulus. According to the second of the above suppo-
sitions (viz. 6), the fact of the high excitability of the nutrient tubes would be explained
by the consideration that a stimulus applied to the snupposed nerye-trunk would directly
affect a greater number of the plexus-elements than would a stimulus applied to any
other part of the bell. The additional fact to be met, viz. the pointing of the polypite
to a single unsevered tube, is not quite 80 easy to explain on the present suppoxsition;
for if the assumed nerve-trunk is identical in function with a true nerve-trunk, the
afferent elements collected in it ought to communicate to the polypite the impression of
having had their distal terminations irritated ; and therefore the fact of a number of
8uch elements being collected into a single trunk ought not to cauxe the polypite to refer
a distant seat of irritation to that trunk rather than to any of the parts from which the
plexus-clements may emanate. Concerning this difficulty, however, I may observe that
we seem to have in it one of those cases in which it would be very unsafe to argue with
any confidence from the highly integrated nervous systems with which we are best
