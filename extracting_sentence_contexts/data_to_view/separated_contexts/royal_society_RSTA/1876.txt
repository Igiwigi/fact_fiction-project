Case 4 updated the power coefficient of the devices from 0.3 to 0.41, based
on recent reported data from full-scale operational turbines in industry [32]. This increased the
estimated annual energy yield obtained in Case 3 by 37%, to 3.18 TWh. Finally, Case 5 reduced the
array capacity of the array to account for the fact that the devices rated speeds, and hence rated
power, were too high for the flow speeds incident on the devices. While this has no impact on the
estimated energy yield of the array, it increases the capacity factor by 63%, from 11% to 18%. Additional array performance improvements have also been identified.
