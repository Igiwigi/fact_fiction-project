And this seems principally to have been done with a view to satisfy
the Public, that their usual meetings were then continued, for the im-
provement of knowledge, and benefit of mankind, the great ends of
their first institution by the Royal Charters, and which they have ever
since steadily pursued. But the Society being of late years greatly enlarged, and their com-
munications more numerous, it was thought advisable, that a Com-
mittee of their members should be appointed to reconsider the papers
read before them, and select out of them such as they should judge
most proper for publication in the future Transactions; which was
accordingly done upon the 26th of March, 1752. And the grounds

of their choice are, and will continue to be, the importance and sin-
gularity of the subjects, or the advantageous manner of treating them;
without pretending to answer for the certainty of the facts, or pro-
priety of the reasonings, contained in the seyeral papers so published,
which must still rest on the credit or judgment of their respective
authors,

It is likewise necessary on this occasion to remark, that it is an esta-
blished rule of the Society, to which they will always adhere, never to
give their opinion, as a Body, upon any subject, either of Nature or
Art, that comes before them. And therefore the thanks, which are
frequently proposed from the Chair to be given to the authors of such
papers as are read at their accustomed meetings, or to the persons through
whose hands they receive them, are to be considered in no other light
than as a matter of civility, in*return for the respect shewn to the So-
ciety by those communications. Â© The like-also is to be said with re-
gard to the several projects, inventions, and curiosities of various
kinds, which are often exhibited to the Society ; the authors whereof,
or those who exhibit them, frequently take the liberty to report, and
even to certify in the public news-papers, that they have met with the
highest applanse and approbation. And therefore it is hoped, that no
regard will hereafter be paid to such reports, and public notices; which
in some instances have been too: lightly credited, to the disghonour of
the Society.
