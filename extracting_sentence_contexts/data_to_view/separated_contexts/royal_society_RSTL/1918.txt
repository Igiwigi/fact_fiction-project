It was obseryed in one frog that the strychnine applied to a single posterior
extremity induced general tetanus. General tetanus, in the human subject, is
the effect of the local wound of a nerve. These facts demonstrate the strict
connexion and unity of the different parts of the nervous system. The anatomy of the reflex function must be particularly studied in the me-
dulla oblongata; in the portions of the spinal marrow which give origin to
the nerves of the anterior and posterior extremities ; in that of the intermediate
space which supplies the trunk ; in that which is the source of the nerves of
the sphincters, the ejaculators, &c., and in that which supplies the tail ; and,
lastly, in reference to the several columns of which the spinal marrow is com-
posed. I think the investigation of the anatomy will, for various reasons, be
best pursned in the hedgehog.
