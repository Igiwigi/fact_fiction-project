On the assumption of dicliny the drop-mechanism of the functional ovule,
which had been utilised by insects, is retained in the staminate flower in full
working order, since insects which go to one flower for honey are likely to expect

plasmolytie sugar-solution, and this may even abstract water from the cell-contents of the massive stigma-
head by exosmosis through the surface-pits. But the question really involved is the extent to which this “stigma dise,” with its insect-visited
exudation, was similarly constructed and equally entomophilous in the original hermaphrodite flowers, at a
period, that is to say, when it also acted as a pollen-collecting funnel. The fact that the edges of the disc
are incurved in older withered flowers, and the papillose surfaces more or less approximated, suggests the
possibility of a preceding mechanism for pollen-retention,
