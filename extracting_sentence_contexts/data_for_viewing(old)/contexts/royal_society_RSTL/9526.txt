each of them equal to a linear function of du and dv: 80 that the quotient-functions are
du da
is thus an addition-theorem for them, in accordance with the theory of these integrals.

26. The first 16 equations of the product-theorem, putting therein first u=0, v=0,
and then v'=0, v'=0, and using the results to eliminate the functions on the right
hand side, give expressions for

in fact the 15 hyper-elliptic functions belonging to the integrals and there

(that is, A(u+u", v+»).B(u—r', v—v)) &c.) in terms of the functions of (#, v) and
(1, v) : and we have thus an addition-with-subtraction theorem for the double theta-
functions. And we have thence also consequences analogous to those which present
themselves in the theory of the single functions.

Remark as to notation.
27. I remark as regards the single theta-functions that the characteristics
