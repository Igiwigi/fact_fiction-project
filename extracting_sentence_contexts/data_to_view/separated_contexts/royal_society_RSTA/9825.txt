DARWIN: FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF THE

term involves under the integral sign’ the factor } (At A)-34, all the other
factors being positive. If we attribute to 0 and to various values between $7 and
zero, we see that in part of the range the factor is positive and in other parts
negative. A general inspection does not suffice to determine whether the positive
portion outweighs the negative, as in fact it does. Therefore, in order to feel
abundantly sure that no gross mistake had been made, I computed by quadratures
the eight constituent integrals involved in the final result, and confirmed the correct-
ness of the value found by the rigorous evaluation. The analysis of the investigation has been carefully examined throughout, and I
have, besides, applied the same method to the investigation of Maciaurin’s spheroid,
where the solution can be verified by the known exact result.*

As a further check, the formule of the paper on the Pear-shaped Figure have been
examined on the hypothesis that the ellipsoid of reference reduces to a sphere.
