But in now taking leave of the interesting
series of facts which have led to these inferences, I should like to observe that, while I
know the former cannot be modified by future investigation, I feel the latter may thus
be shown imperfect or untrue. Tt has not seemed to me, however, that this is a suffi-
cient reason to ayoid speculation at the stage which my inquiries have now reached. There can be no doubt that the facts concerning Tiaropsis indicans are of a highly st1g-
gestive character ; and I think it will shortly be found desirable thus to have paved the
way towards arriving at some sort of conception with regard to analogous, though far
more astonishing, facts which are presently to be adduced concerning Aurelia aurita.

$ 3. Character of the Nervo-museular Tiswe of Staurophora laciniata,â€”(a) The few
individuals of this species which IT was this year able to procure I utilized in the study
of those peculiar spasmodic moyements to which allusion was made in my former paper. These movements, it will be remembered, never occur spontaneously, but only in response
to stimulation of certain parts of the organism, under which condition they never fail to
occur, It will further be remembered that these spasmodic movements consist of a
sudden and most violent contraction of the entire muscle-sheet, the effect of which is to
draw together all the gelatinous walls of the nectocalyx in a far more powerful manner
than occurs during ordinary swimming.
