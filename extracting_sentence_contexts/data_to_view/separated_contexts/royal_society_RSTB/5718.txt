It has been found, however, that these figures give rather little information as to
the stage of differentiation which has been attained, and where more accurate data are required, it has been
necessary to fall back on an arbitrary classification based on the length of the primitive streak. (See note
to Protocols, p. 197.) When the head process had appeared at the time of operation, this is always stated,
