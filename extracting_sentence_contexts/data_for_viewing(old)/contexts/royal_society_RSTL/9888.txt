- A curious accident should here be described which established the fact that the alloy
is a definite chemical compound. A number of pieces of nickel-iron from this meteorite
which had become rusty were heated in a porcelain tube in a current of hydrogen.
During the progress of the experiment, which was conducted out of doors, it came on
to rain, and some drops touched the hot tube and cracked it. Air slowly entered the
crack and oxidised the iron ti]l it acquired a bright blue colour ; while the little plate
of Edmondsonite remained colourless (Plate 53, fig. 1). This result accords with the
conelusion arrived at by STODART and FARADAY 8ome sixty years ago,* on the oxidation
of alloys of iron and nickel. An alloy of iron, or rather of the bess Bombay wootz,
