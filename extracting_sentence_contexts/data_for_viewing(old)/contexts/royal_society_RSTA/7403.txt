divided. The mean of this sample will be denoted by ,A,. Lf ¢ is even there is no centrally
located systematic sample, but either of the two samples a half unit off centre can usually
be taken as equivalent to a centrally located sample.

Since there is only one centrally located sample for a given sequence or function, no mean
square deviation corresponding to V[f,] can be calculated for a single sequence or function.
The sampling error can only be expressed in terms of the difference of the mean of the sample
from the mean of the whole sequence or function.

(d) End-corrections

Instead of taking the ordinary mean ,/, fora randomly located systematic sample, allow-
ance can be made for the fact that the first and last terms are situated at distances from the
ends of the sequence or function which in general differ from 4d. The simplest form of
adjustment, and the only one which is ordinarily worth considering, is to assign a weight to
the first term of ($d-+-r—4)/d in the case of a sequence and (4$¢+-7)/din the case of a function,
and a similar weight of ($d+-r’—4)/d or (4d+7’)/d to the last term, where 7’ is the number
or distance of the last term reckoned from the end of the sequence or function.

We will call such a mean the mean of a randomly located systematic sample with end-
corrections and will denote it by ,/,. If/ is not a multiple of d the divisor ,n, will be replaced
by a non-integral divisor ,n/,. The mean square deviation v[h/,] can be defined as before,
retaining ,n,. If the sequence is random, v[h/,] will not be an exact estimate of o?, but with
a sequence of any length the difference will be of no consequence.
