The references are to Mr. Darrox's paper in the Philosophical Transactions. Tt is unnecessary to refer
specifically to the testimonies to three facts, as almost all the observations co-
incide regarding them. 1st, 'That the arch of the aurora, when at the zenith,
is placed at right angles to the magnetic meridian : 2nd, That there it is only
of small breadth : and 3rd, That it moves southwards. None of the observers
appear to haye had an opportunity for observing the transition of the vertical
streamers from a low northerly situation into the zenith arch ; but Messrs,
CoLpsTrEam and Focgo at Edinburgh saw, and haye well described some of
the concluding stages of this transition, and the transformation which the
figures and intensity of the lights undergo at the approach to the zenith. The
8udden formation of the meteor, only *a few degrees to the north of the
zenith,‚Äù gave them no opportunity for observing the earlier stages.
