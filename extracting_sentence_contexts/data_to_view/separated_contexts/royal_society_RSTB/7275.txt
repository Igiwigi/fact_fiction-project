The result is successive fascicles following one upon another in a wavy course. This probably represents the simplest type of trabecula. It should be noted that the distinc-
tion between a simple and a composite sclerodermite (Vaughan & Wells 1943) is merely
a matter of convenience and relativity, for in fact no sclerodermites are really simple when
more than one bundle of fibres passed out from them, and the calcification centres are very
rarely arranged in a single linear series. A quite distinct type of trabecula was noticed by Hill in the 77yplasma group, which she
calls the rhabdacanth. This is a kind of composite trabecula, in which each rod represents
a small trabecula developed from one small invagination of the ectoderm.
