greater part of the year are necessarily very poor in oxygen because they are rapidly
filled with decomposing organic matter, which remains there until destroyed by bacterial
action.

Thus, during Devonian times the conditions were such as to exaggerate the advantages
of air as a respiratory medium. Under these circumstances the habit of taking air
into the pharynx would be expected to arise, as it has done since in many siluroids,
and even in roach and other British freshwater fish ; and to a consistent addition to
this habit it is natural to attribute the presence of a lung or an air bladder introduced
to render air breathing more effective.

The original conclusion that the internal nostrils of Osteolepids imply an_air-
breathing habit is confirmed by the fact that whilst the Old Red Sandstone Coelacanth
Diplocercides possessed similar internal nostrils, the marine Triassic and Cretaceous
Coelacanths possess only an external nostril, usually divided into two as it is in
Actinopterygii.

It is interesting to notice that the respiratory movements of Ceratodus are carried
out by the same structures as those of Urodeles, and that they have an almost identical
rhythm. In Ceratodus water is drawn into the buccal cavity through the mouth by
lowering the basihyal, whilst the operculums are pressed inward so as to close the gill
chamber. The mouth is then closed and the water expelled behind the operculum by
raising the floor of the buccal cavity.

In the Urodela air is taken in through the nostrils by lowering the floor of the buccal
