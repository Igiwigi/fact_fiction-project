in NaP,
p = 11148678+ 000477 and the denominator of P, (1) = 2°116902+°000070.

The variations are, of course, subject to the correct value of N being 109675 and to
m being integral. Alterations in N or taking, say, m to be m+°5 would produce
further consequent alterations in A,

Relation (D).—An inspection of the values given for S() and D(), with their
possible variations, show that in all cases their values are the same within limits of
observation,

Relation (E).—The equality of P,(o) and P,() is so far justified by the fact
that its assumption in calculating P, gives constants which reproduce the observations
within possible errors. There is, however, still room for doubt as to exact equality,
owing to imperfection of data.

Relation (F).—Viz.: 8(«) = VP(1). If S() be written in the form N/D” and
D be the denominator of P (1), this relation involves the equality of D and D’. The
values are given in the table. From them we get the following values of D’—D :—
