New computations performed with the use of
the GLH3P potential energy surface and the Moss vibrational masses gave close agreement
with the experimental frequencies [44]. The smallness of the rotational parameters, a, and 42,
demonstrated that the rotational non-adiabatic correction is one order of magnitude smaller than
the vibrational correction. Furthermore, due to the fact that the rotational transitions obey the
angular momentum selection rule AJ =0,+1, and hence the absolute J-dependent errors are
similar for the two states, these errors almost cancel out when energy differences are formed. Therefore, the computed rotational transition frequencies are more accurate than the term values
themselves (10-°-10~? cm! for moderate values of J).

(b) Vibrational and rotational shifts by effective mass models

In a paper published in 2007, Kutzelnigg [19] addressed the question of ‘Which masses are
vibrating or rotating in a molecule?’ and analysed the cases of Hz and Hj. Explicit formulae
for effective masses for these molecules were derived starting from an LCAO (linear combination
of atomic orbitals) approach.
