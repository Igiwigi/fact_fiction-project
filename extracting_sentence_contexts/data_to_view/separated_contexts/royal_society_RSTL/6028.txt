The precipitate, after bemg well washed with spirit, was dried and weighed. The size of the liver is to a most striking extent influenced by the nature of the diet ;
and the alteration that is thus induced is chiefly, if not entirely, due to the amount of
amyloid snbstance/ present. TI was first conducted to the discovery of these facts, whilst
in my early experiments I was seeking to determine if the quantity of sngar found in
* the liver and blood of the dog after death was altered from its ordinary amount by the
previous administration of a strictly vegetable diet. The process I then adopted for
examining the liver was to remove and weigh it, and then to pass a stream of water
through its vessels until its tissne was completely deprived of sugar, After a vegetable
diet, T noticed, first, that the liver was of enormous size, in comparison with what IL
had been accustomed to meet with under an animal diet; and secondly, that there was
a remarkable quantity of a material present which much interfered with my analysis,
and which I sabsequently found to be amyloid substance. In all the observations that follow, the life of the animal was suddenly destroyed, its
body then opened, and the liver removed.
