of the fluid passing from the visceral chamber into the water-vascular system, and
conversely, Muscular compression exerted upon the fluid in the water-vascular
system (the walls of which are remarkably muscular) will force it back into the
visceral cavity; a ©diastole* of the vesicles of the feet occurring coincidently with
the compression of integumentary parietes of the general cavity, will cause a return
of it again into the blood-vascular system. This is a beautiful and perfect mechaniem.

The grounds whereon the identity of the fluid contained (in the Echinoderms) in
the system of the blood-proper with that which fills the water-vascular system and
the abdominal cavity is maintained, may be briefly stated as follows :—In Uraster
papposa the oral membranous disc exceeds very much in diameter that of the common
Asterias. This circumstance renders the circular central blood-vessel in the former
much more conspicuous and accessible than in the latter. It was this fact which led
me to make choice of Uraster as the subject of my researches. In this species the
circular channel forming the centre of the blood-system coincides with the circum-
ference of the oral membranous disc. The vascular channel (scarcely to be called
a vessel) rests upon the hard edge of the calcareous framework. It. is 80 closely and
intimately adherent to the hard unyielding surface beneath, that *the conditions”
seem to be destroyed which might permit the contractions of this vessel as a cir-
culating centre. No instance is known in which a contractile heart is thus anatomi-
cally connected : nor are the coats of this circular vessel, in Uraster papposa, endowed
with muscular fibres. It is lined internally as well as externally by vibratile epithelium.
