Before discussing the results of my own observations on the secretory phenomena
of different regions of the oviduct, I have included in Table I a classification of the
cell types and their probable contributions to the formation of the mature egg.
This will serve also to summarize my final conclusions which are dealt with more
fully in this discussion.

As might be expected, the reactions of the constituents of egg-white to different
fixatives and stains, are extremely variable. The chemistry of this material has
been widely investigated, but little attempt has been made, in previous papers on
the histology of the fowl oviduct, to identify the components of the egg-white in the
newly formed secretions lying within the crypts of a functioning oviduct, after
sectioning and staining. The fact that successful histological demonstration of
undistorted albumen is counter to the simultaneous preservation of the mucin
secretions, can be shown to account for differences in previous descriptions of the
oviducal glands. Probably the most successful investigation of the albumen region,
in particular, will result from material prepared by the freezing-drying technique.
The proteins of egg-white may be so little altered after freezing and dehydration
in vacuo as to facilitate the use of reagents or criteria commonly applied in the
chemical investigation of these substances. This method has not been available in
the present work. The best preservation of clear albumen masses in the free lumen
of the oviduct, in the gland lumina and in the cytoplasm of the gland epithelium
has resulted from fixation in Zenker-formol without acetic acid. Mucin identifica-
tion, of course, requires different fixation.
