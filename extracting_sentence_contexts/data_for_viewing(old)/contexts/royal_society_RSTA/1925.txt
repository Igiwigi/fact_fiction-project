extruder. Therefore, is it not always straightforward to simply swap one polymer for another and
expect the melt processing to be exactly the same. These machines are expensive and therefore
if they need to be upgraded or replaced when switching to processing bioplastics, then this
capital cost could be a significant hurdle for many processing companies to switch to using
bioplastics.


(b) Degradation, compositing and digestion

Many synthetic polymers will persist in the environment for very long periods of time, which is
not surprising, since many of these plastics were designed specially to be durable, mechanically
robust, and chemically and biologically resilient. While this means the properties of the polymer
can be relied on to maintain their properties during their legitimate use, the fact they don’t readily
degrade causes the products to persist for a very long time after they have become waste [116].
For these reasons, the concept of biodegradability and compostability of plastics have become
very widely explored.

While many bioplastics claim to be biodegradable or compostable (or sometimes both), in
reality these plastics do not all readily disappear when you try to compost them. Anyone who
has tested the compostability of a biodegradable plastic product at home will have typically
found the product looks exactly the same even months (sometimes years) later. The bio-processes
required to break down the long polymer chains require specific bacteria that attack and break
apart the target chemical moieties in the backbone (see §3b). Some polymers, such as polyesters
that contain ester groups, are particularly susceptible to bacterial degradation, but other polymers
such as polyolefins are effectively totally unaffected. The bacteria need a specific set of conditions
