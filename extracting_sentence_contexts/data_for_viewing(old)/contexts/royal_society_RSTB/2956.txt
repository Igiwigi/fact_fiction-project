exhaustive study of the general anatomy of these forms to demonstrate whether the
similarity in their more obvious features is a family trait or is a phenomenon of con-
vergence. We have, curiously enough, in the Eleutherorhabda no intermediate
gradations between the homorhabdie and heterorhabdic conditions such as are to be
seen in the Synaptorhabda; for even in the case of Lithodomus and its allies, the
approach to the heterorhabdic condition lies rather in the limitation of the inter-
lamellar septa to certain filaments at intervals than in the enlargement and special-
isation of the septum-bearing filaments themselves.

In reviewing the species included in the second and third divisions of the Eleu-
therorhabda, it becomes apparent that in those forms in which the upper extremities
of the ascending filaments are in organic connection, no great importance can be
attached to the fact that the upper edge of the ascending lamella remains free from
adjacent parts in some, while it is concrescent with them in others. Thus, while in
Melina serratula the upper edges of the ascending lamellze show no concrescence with
the mantle, visceral mass, nor with one another, in Melina perna the inner lamelle
fuse with one another behind the visceral mass, the outer lamellae remaining free
from the mantle. In Melina lingueformis the inner ascending lamelle are fused
with the visceral mass, and behind this with one another, while the outer ascending
lamella is fused with the mantle for the full extent of its upper edge.

Conerescence of the inner ascending lamelle behind the visceral mass occurs in
Anomia ephippium, but not in Anomia laqueata nor Anomia patelliformis. In
Aulacomya ovalis and in Septifer bilocularis the outer ascending lamelle are fused
with the mantle, and the inner lamelle with the visceral mass, but not with one
