Yet, in the exception above mentioned, and also in the second one alluded to,
which occurred more recently, the fluid was efficacious at the end of twenty-four
hours in the first, and twenty-siz hours in the 8econd instance, the temperature being
similar on the two occasions. In both instances the fluid contained a very large
quantity of developmental cells, and had been procured from individuals which were
not fully prepared for the exercise of their fecundatory function. Further, I may
add, that in each of these instances, after the fluid had been supplied to some eggs
to test its effect, I found many undeveloped spermatozoal cells adhering to the
surface of the eggs, and detected some spermatic bodies in the act of being liberated
from them. 'These facts, then, are confirmatory of the snggestion respecting the
results obtained by Prevosr and Dumas. The presence of undeveloped cells in the fluid obtained from the living Frog is
explicable in two or three ways: first, in that of the animal having but recently
been taken from its natural haunts, either early in the season, or at a later period,
after a continuance of unusually cold weather and easterly wind, or after the Sexes
have but recently united ; in either of which cases, as also in certain others, in which
the individual itself has been late in the development of its reproductive organism,
developmental cells are thrown off from the testes together with already liberated
spermatozoa, and are usually abundant in the efferential ducts and vesicles. It may
thus be seen that in judging of the length of time during which the fluid preserves
its fecundatory influence, and consequently, the spermatozoon its vitality, after removal
from the body, it is necessary to take into consideration, not only the temperature
of the surrounding medium, but also the precise condition of the fluid itself.
