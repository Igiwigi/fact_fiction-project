Owing to the need for input data, such as equilibria, etc. it was not possible
to perform the calculations for a larger machine as described above. However, if one considers
a 1.3m thick blanket, which is a reactor relevant breeding blanket, instead of the 0.5m blanket
in ITER, then the plasma size represents a 9m fusion reactor which is already quite close to the
10m described above. Owing to the fact that the old ITER machine had an aspect ratio around 3
the fusion power would be lower than in a 2.5 aspect ratio machine with the same major radius. Figures 2 and 3 show the operation spaces in inductive only operation of ITER and the 8.2m
machine named DEMO due to its relevance for a fusion reactor plasma. As one can see in figure 2, ITER will achieve 500 MW below the Greenwald density and if, as
the author is convinced, the Greenwald density is not the limit one can see that ITER could achieve
up to a GW of fusion power in a small corner of the operational window.
