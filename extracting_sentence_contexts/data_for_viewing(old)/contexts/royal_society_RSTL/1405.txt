contained also remains of horns of at least two/species of deer,
(see Plate XXILL. fig. g, 4, and z..) Oneof these resembles the
horn of the common stag or red deer, the circumference of
the base measuring 92 inches, which is precisely the size of
our largest stag. A second (fig. 4.) measures 72 inches at
the same part, and both have two antlers, that rise very near
the base. In a smaller species the lowest antler is g+ inches
above the base, the circumference of which is 8 inches, (see
fig. 5.) No horns are found entire, but fragments only, and
these apparently gnawed to pieces like the bones : their lower
extremity nearest the head js that which has generally es-
caped destruction : and it is a curious fact, that this portion of
all the horns I have seen from the cave, shows, by the rounded
state of the base, that they had fallen off by absorption or
necrosis, and been shed from the head on which they grew,
and not broken off by, violence.

It must already appear probable, from the facts above de-
scribed, particularly from the comminuted state and appa-
rently gnawed condition of the bones, that the cave at Kirk-
dale was, during a long succession of years, inhabited as a
den by hyznas, and that they dragged into its recesses the
other animal bodies whose remains are found mixed indis-
criminately with their own ; and this conjecture is rendered
