Numerical analysis of the results obtained from the experiments was carried out using the DVV
[26] method. DVV is employed as a statistical marker to track structural changes in the system
using only the dynamic responses of the platform and due to the presence of various designs of
MTLCDs. DVV is based on a surrogate data methodology, elaborated in detail by Schreiber &
Schmitz [27], for detecting the determinism and nonlinearity in a time series. The DVV method
is explained and further elaborated and tested in Gautama et al. [28-30] and Mandic et al. [31]. A
separate paper in this Theme Issue tests DVV for floating platforms and the potential of its use for
tracking changes in structural properties is identified there [32]. Advantages of using this method


relate to the facts that it does not require any prior knowledge about the system or the excitation,
it is robust to the presence of noise, it is straightforward to interpret and typically exhibits
improved performance over other traditionally available methods [30]. Numerical analyses were
performed using the DVV toolbox [33]. The output of the method is one number for each
response signal recorded, shown by the root mean square error (RMSE), and represents the degree
of nonlinearity of the response [30]. In all DVV analyses the following parameters were kept
constant: embedding dimension m = 3, time lag t = 1, maximal span parameter ng = 2, number
of standardized distances for which target variances are computed Nty = 50, number of surrogates
considered Ny = 50 and the number of reference DVs considered Ny» = 200. Discussions related
to the choice of these parameters and computation of DVV have already been already reported
by Jaksic et al. [32,34].
