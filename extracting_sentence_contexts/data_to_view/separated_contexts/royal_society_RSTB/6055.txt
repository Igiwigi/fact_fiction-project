That is to say, swift rotation
towards the right and abrupt cessation of a leftward rotation stimulate only the
right posterior canal, and vice versa. ‘The anomaly here is that it is a posterior
canal on the side opposite to that of the persisting utricle that brings about the
upset. Plainly we are here confronted with conditions very different from those
that obtain when the same frog is quickly tilted. Apart from the primary fact that a utricular macula is not affected by mere spin,
whereas it is affected by quick tilt, the only explanation of the anomaly that we would
proffer is that, when a rotation to the intact side is suddenly checked, the frog’s head
is leaning strongly to the operated side. When it now begins, by excitation of the
appropriate posterior canal, to be torqued to the intact side, a wide range of free
arc is available to it. When, on the other hand, a rotation to the operated side is
suddenly checked, the frog’s head still leans slightly to that side.
