In certain sporogonia the similarity of
structure of the young seta and capsule suggests that the former is a sterilised region. of the same nature as the head, In the Pteridophyta such indications are naturally
less clear, though the structural similarity of the vegetative and fertile regions of
Lycopodium Selago point to a similar conclusion. â€˜The facts, inconclusive as they are,
coincide with a theory of sterilisation as the source of the basal vegetative region. (6). In all Archegoniate plants the spores are produced internally, being covered by
at least one layer of protective cells; but the depth within the plant-body at which
they are produced is chiefly determined by the facilities for nutrition, and by the
method of dissemination, while it is also closely dependent upon the bulk of the
sporogenous tissue itself.
