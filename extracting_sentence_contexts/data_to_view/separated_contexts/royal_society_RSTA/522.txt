We here recap
some of the basic properties that have been investigated so far:

— Global-local coherence. Coherence of the aggregate field computations in a distributed
execution is maintained for field calculus by tracking which nbr operations align with
one another, meaning that they are part of the same aggregate operation and should
share information via the field output by nbr. Determining alignment has a number
of subtleties stemming from the fact that execution may proceed differently on different
devices, and that any given function may be called multiple times. As a consequence, two
neighbouring devices may each evaluate a single nbr statement in the code many times,
with some of these evaluations aligning and sharing information, while others do not
align and remain isolated. Alignment is thus the local implementation of the aggregate
notion of a field’s domain, and the key to ensuring a provable relationship between

“In fact, it is sufficient to track only the values supplied to nbr operations and the context of those operations.
