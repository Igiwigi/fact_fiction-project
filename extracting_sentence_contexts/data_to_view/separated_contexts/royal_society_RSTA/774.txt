Therefore, if we have a quantum-realizable empirical model specified by a state |y) and a set of
measurements X, then, given any unitary U, the empirical model specified by the state U|y) and
the set of measurements UXUt = {UAUTt | A € X} is equivalent to the original one, in the sense
that it assigns the same probabilities, which of course implies that it has the same contextuality
properties. In the particular case when |y) is a stabilizer state for the subgroup S <P, and U is an LC
operation, then the state U|) is a stabilizer state for the subgroup usut ={UPUt | PeS}. An important fact we shall need is that AvN triples are sent to AvN triples by such
LC operations. The reason is that LC operations are composed of local unitaries that act as
permutations on the set (+X, +Y,+Z}, and therefore preserve all the conditions of definition 4.1. We now show that AvN triples fully characterize AVN arguments for stabilizer states and that
a tripartite GHZ state is always responsible for the existence of such an AvN proof of strong
contextuality.
