Having been informed
themſelves of what was to be depended upon in theſe
matters, they then ſet about to give others the. ſame
information; and this occaſioned the preſent work,
where we find decifive experiments upon every que-
{tion relating to the ſubject. Theſe have been inge-
niouſly imagined, ſenfibly conducted, ranged in pro-
per order, robbed of all ſuperfluous reaſoning, ws

- made juſt in the ſame manner as thoſe of the academy
del Cimento, the value of which every one preſent, I
preſume, is not now to be apprized of. The truth of this publication is not to be ſuſpected;
it comes from the very place, where medical elec-
tricity took its riſe ; and is not the production of one
perſon, who might be ſuſpected too ſlightly to have
admitted what might tend to favour his own opi-
nions, Theſe are facts confider'd in themſelves in-
dependently of all application, deciſions of the unani-
mous voice of a number of very ſenſible men, and
in the face of a-great number of witneſſes, many of
them prejudiced to the contrary, und but here forced
to be convinced by the evidence of facts,

The gentlemen concerned in conducting theſe ex-
periments divided them into three claſſes, The firſt
claſs contains a ſeries of experiments made with tubes
and globes containing odoriferous or other ſubſtances,
in order to obſerve, when theſe were cloſely ſtopped,
whether the odorous, as well as other effects of the
ſubſtances included, would pervade the glaſs. The
ſecond claſs includes experiments made with tubes
and globes, which have nothing within them ; but
the perſons electriſed hold in their hands, or fome-
times place under their naked feet, odoriferous,

purging, or even the moſt poiſonous ſubſtances, in
order to obſerve, whether the perſons electrifed in
this manner would be ſenſible of the effects of theſe
ſubſtances, The third claſs gives us a ſeries of expe-
riments different from the two former, in which the
ſubſtances before-mention'd are mixed with the wa-
ter, as jn making the experiment of Leyden. From
theſe experiments we are to diſcover, whether from
Eee receiving

receiving the ſhocks from theſe bottles, the perſon is
ſenfible of the effects in his body of the ſubſtances
contained in them.

- I ſhould be carried very far, were I to be too par-
ticular in my accounts of theſe experiments: I ſhall
content myſelf therefore in mentioning to you the
bodies employed, and the reſult therefrom.
