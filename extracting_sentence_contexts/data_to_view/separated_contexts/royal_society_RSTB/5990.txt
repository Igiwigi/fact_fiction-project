J. Parker (1892), and Suscukry (1899) in the forms
studied by them. The recognition of the fact that the infrapolar process is a different structure from
the basitrabecular process solves a problem raised by a comparison between the crocodile
and the bird (DE Brrr, 1926, 6). Infrapolar processes are also present in the crocodile,
and the palatine nerves run on their median side, whereas they run on the lateral side
of the infrapolar processes in birds. Since the infrapolar processes are free down-
growths from the polar cartilage, there is no reason why they should not grow inside
the palatine nerves in one case and outside them in another.
