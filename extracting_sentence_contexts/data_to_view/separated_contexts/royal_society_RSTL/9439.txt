ROWE ON ABEL'S THEOREM.

and by the definition of 7
[0]-[2]=2r,

while from the conditions (E)

27,>3—Jja—A,, 16., >3—5, or 3=$—4L
<3—ja+A, te, <3

8 that 27,>0<83

whence [0]=[2], [2]+1, [2]+2, [2]+3,

and 80 if the degree of q, be denoted by 0 that of q; is +1; and that of 9, may be
either 0, 0+1, 0+2, or 0+83. We have, then, by art. 13 (i)

«=[0]+[1]+[2]+2=38+3, 30+4, 38+5, or 30+6
while
=p {[pi+pi71} +2b2{[p2] p20}
=2(0+3)+{0, 0+1, 8+2, 0+3}
=30+6, 30+7, 30+8, 30+9

80 that, as on the las page,
þp—=a=38. We have proved then that the 8um of any number of integrals of the form indi-
cated by the fact that they are rationalized by the introduction of y, where

Ptpay+py+Þ;=0,

can be reduced to the gum of three; the equation-of condition being gy*+qy + =0%
where q\=qz+1, and q, lies between q, and q+3 inclusiye. SecrIoN III.

22. We have shown that the 8um of any number whatever of similar functions guch
as are discussed in this paper can be reduced to an expression algebraical or logarithmic
added to a fixed number of snch functions whose variables are functions of the variables
of the given functions, this fixed number depending only on the form of function
considered,

From this a more general theorem may be shown to follow, viz. : thab @ similar
