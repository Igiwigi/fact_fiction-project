quency/time law would be slightly modified. First, if parts of the path were unionized and
therefore non-dispersive the f~! against ¢ graph for the whistler would intersect the time axis
at an instant later than that of the atmospheric, the difference between the two times being
the time taken by light to traverse a distance equal to the combined lengths of these parts.
Secondly, if along much of the path there were weak ionization with x/y~1, then one can
show by use of the fuller expression (9) for the group-ray refractive index that the effect
would be to produce a slight downward curvature of the /~! against ¢ graph at the high-
frequency end. In fact, however, it can be seen from the table in §2@, which shows the range
of x/y encountered in the ionosphere, that the condition is likely to be well satisfied along
much of the whistler path.

Whistlers, as stated earlier (§5), are found to obey the linear /~! against ¢ law, and thus
the dispersion theory of their origin is confirmed. The fact that the whistlers are not pure
tones can be explained by assuming that their waves travel from source to observer not by
a single path but by a range of paths, each producing a different dispersion.

The intercepts of the /~! against ¢ graphs of the long whistlers on the time axis were always
found to coincide with the times of occurrence of their preceding atmospheric clicks, but
unfortunately this result cannot be regarded as confirming that their path is dispersive

along the whole of its length, since the probable errors of the estimated positions of the
intercepts correspond to considerable distances at the velocity of light.
