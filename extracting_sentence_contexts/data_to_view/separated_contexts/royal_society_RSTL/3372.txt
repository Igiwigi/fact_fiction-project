In the larvz of several insects, in which both perfect
and imperfect fasciculi may be examined at the same time, the row of central cor-
puscles is equally well marked in both when properly prepared. In an early stage of their development, the primitive fasciculi are often narrow
flattened bands, and present bulgings at irregular distances, which depend on the
existence of these bodies. It is interesting to notice how closely, in this state,
they resemble in form, size, and structure, the adult condition of the musele of
organic life, which has for the first time been correctly represented and described,
though in brief terms, by Dr. Bary, the able translator of Mizzer's Physiology, This
is a fact which may hereafter prove important in the history of organic development. The similitude may be seen by a reference to figs. 56.
