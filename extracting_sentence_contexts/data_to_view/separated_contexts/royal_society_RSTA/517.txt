The term refers to the study of the physical conditions in solar atmospheric magnetic
and plasma structures from the analysis of the observed wave properties. It was first suggested
by Uchida [56] and Roberts et al. [57] in the coronal context, and by Roberts & Joarder [169] in
the prominence context. The aim is to increase our knowledge about the complicated structure
and dynamics of the solar atmosphere and is based on the fact that the properties of the observed
oscillations are determined by the plasma and magnetic field properties. Solar atmospheric seismology has experienced a great advancement (see [24,50,52,53,170,171
for reviews). This was made possible by the increase in the quantity and quality of wave activity
observations and the refinement of theoretical MHD wave models.
