it is thus clear that the canonical Sturm-Liouville series will all converge uniformly

converges uniformly to zero in this interval. We have thus proved the theorem :—

The answer to the question whether the canonical Sturm-Liouville series corre-
sponding to an assigned function all converge uniformly, or not, in an interval (y, 8)
contained within (0, 7) depends only upon the values assumed by the function in an
interval enclosing (y, 8) in its interior, and exceeding it in length by an arbitrarily
small amount.
