At maturity the enclosure of the seed was no doubt
less complete. The transverse section W. 1915, M. (Plate 7, fig. 1) shows that even
in the mature condition the cupule still reached to near the apex, but at this stage it

was in all probability open at the top, as shown by the fact that most of the seeds
found had freed themselves from it altogether. The seed was borne terminally on a pedicel, as seen in the longitudinal section 8, 558
(Plate 5, phot. 15 and Plate 10, fig. 33), the only case in which the connection is shown
ina mature specimen; the seed, though cut tangentially, measures 4°5 millims. in
length by 2°8 millims. in maximum width. The pedicel is shown for a length of
about 2 millims., but as it is incomplete below, no idea of its real length can be
formed.
