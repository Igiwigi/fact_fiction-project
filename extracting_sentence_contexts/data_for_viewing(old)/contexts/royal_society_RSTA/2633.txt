If melt mixing were to proceed more rapidly than cooling, then heterogeneity in the passive
tracer would either be entirely absent or limited to inclusions hosted in olivines with the very
highest forsterite content on figure 4a. By contrast, if mixing is slower than cooling, then diversity
in the compositional tracer should be preserved across the range of olivine compositions: figure 4a
would show a broad band in variability in melt inclusion chemistry across the range of olivine
compositions rather than the clear narrowing that is observed at low forsterite content.

The properties plotted on figure 4 are directly derived from the data and do not involve
assumptions relating to a physical model. The time scale of the mixing and cooling processes
cannot be directly estimated from these properties, but an examination of the relative rates of
mixing and cooling may provide observational constraints on simple models of fluid convection
within a sill. The fact that a record of concurrent mixing and cooling is preserved in the melt
