In practice, however, it is often more convenient. to use, at first, a set of coordinates
more in number than the independent variables of the problem, and therefore subject
to equations of condition,

Let us assume then that the n coordinates 7; +» 2, are Subject to r equations of

and take Z a function of »,, &e., 9:;, &c. (with or without f), defined by the equation

Z==[WIHtwln+:- +2],
(the brackets indicating that x, &c. are expressed in terms of 1, &c.), then it follows
exactly as in art. 18 (Part I.), that the formula (D.) will be changed into the system

Let us now suppose that the system (E.) is to be tr:
