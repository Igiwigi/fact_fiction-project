The different parts do not, however, appear to have the same morphological significance
as those in the mesonephros. Judging from the analogy of Teleostei, the embryonic structure of whose pronephros
is strikingly similar to that of Lepidosteus, the two pronephric chambers into which
the segmental ducts open are constricted off sections of the body-cavity. With the formation of the convoluted duct opening into the isolated section of
