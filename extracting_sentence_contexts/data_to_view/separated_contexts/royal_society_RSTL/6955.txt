which is true, since the left-hand side of the equation is 1+w+pt> ; wil.

which is obyiously the coefficient of a” in (1+2Y)*(@+Ly, i. e. in (1 +a”. (24) If we wish to find the chance of the specific superior limit becoming equal to the
absolute superior limit, we must write 9 in the above formule equal to y, that one of the
two quantities , » which is not greater than the other, and we shall obtain

80 that, in fact, [p, », »+Z]=[p, »+L, »+1], which relation may also be obtained by
@ priori considerations. (25) With reference to the remark made concerning the mode of obtaining the value
of [p, », 9], I proceed to show how it may be obtained directly by the integration of an
equation in differences, and by a method analogous in idea to that by which [p, », +F]
was made to depend on [j, », 9].
