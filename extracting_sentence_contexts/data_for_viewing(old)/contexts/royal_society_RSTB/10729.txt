Figure 2. Eye position offsets caused by suppression of rostral SC activity. (a) Schematic of how neuronal activity is centred and balanced across the two SC during
normal steady fixation. Higher activity is indicated by hotter colours. (b) During suppression of SC activity caused by injection of muscimol, a GABA, agonist that
inhibits neuronal activity, some of the neurons normally active during fixation are silent or less active, as indicated by the cool spot in the SC map. This change in
population activity results in an imbalance in the activity across the two SC. (c) Sample data from a monkey subject (Macaca mulatta) showing the observed
tightward and downward offsets in eye position caused by injecting muscimol into the right rostral SC during one experiment. (d) The stable offset caused
by rostral SC inactivation can be explained by changes in how activity is distributed across the SC. As the eye position shifts down and to the right, the retinotopic
distribution of activity also shifts, until a new equilibrium is reached with balanced activity across the two SC. Figure adapted with permission from [42,43].
