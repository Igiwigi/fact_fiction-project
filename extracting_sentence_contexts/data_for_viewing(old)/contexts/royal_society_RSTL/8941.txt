is the case in the corallum of Corallium rubrum and also in Tubipora, as may be seen
at once by examining the growing end of the tube of a spirit specimen of DubiporaÂ®.
In this respect {{eliopors differs most markedly from both Corallium and Tubipora. The
structure of the hard tisxue of eliopora is, however, in many respects very like that
of the sclerites of Primnoa.

Blue Coloration of the Corallum.

The corallum of eliopor is coloured of a deep blue, and has always been regarded
as remarkable amongst corals for this fact. Now that it is known to be an Aleyonarian
structure the fact is less exceptional, since both Corallium and Tubipora have a deeply
coloured corallum, and many other Alcyonarians have coloured spicules. Amongst Hexac-
tinians Stylasterf ro80ceus is of an intense red, and the corallum of some Fungias is also
red; also that of certain Eupsammide, but amongst these the condition is exceptional,

The blue tint is seen in sections of the corallum to be diffused within the hard tissue.
The colouris faint or almost absent in the freshly growing tips of the corallum, and pale in
the most recently formed superficial structures generally ; it is darkest in the layer be-
neath these in the recently matured tissue. In transverse sections it is een to be darkest at
the surfaces of the walls of the tubes and calicles, In vertical sections of the corallum
the continuation of the dark blue line marking the margin of the wall of each tube
enables the line of the tube to be traced past the snperadded tabula, and marks the
boundary between the two structures. Very exceptionally, intensely blue streaks are
