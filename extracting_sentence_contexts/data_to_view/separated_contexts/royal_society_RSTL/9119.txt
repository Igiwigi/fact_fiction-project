To block Glen Glaster col the glacier would have to
cross Glen Spean, and then to travel 2 miles with a rise of not less than 500 feet Be
and if it reached the top of the pass what was there to stay its further progress ?

* The bottom of the Spean Valley is here about 600 feet above the sea level,

Not only, however, is there the difficulty of conceiving a sufficient vis @ tergo as to
force these two glaciers, after crossing their respective valleys, up the opposite heights,
but considering the breadth and direction of these valleys it is almost impossible to
avoid the conviction that their whole mass would have taken the lines of least resist-
ance, and turning laterally into Glen Spean and the Great Glen, have joined the
ice-streams escaping through them.* That this was the case with the Glen Treig
glacier is I think, as presently explained (p. 684), shown by the direction of the ice
scratches in that part of the Strath Spean immediately opposite the glen. Mr. JamiesoN does, in fact, carry a portion of each glacier for some distance down
these valleys. 80 that one blocked up the entrance of Glen Roy, and the other the
entrance of Glen Spean—but in doing 80 he seems to me to attach too much
importance to their individual action. The formation of the small lake of the Merjelen See, in the Swiss Alps, has been
adduced in illustration of the power of glacier barriers. But this Jake is under 1 mile
in length, by 4 mile wide, with a mean depth of 22 to 25 feet and of 114 feet next
the ice ;f and although it is supported by the Aletsch glacier, which descends 5 miles
lower, and has opposing buttresses in the mountain slopes on the other side of the
glacier a mile wide, nevertheless the water escapes almost every year, and the lake
- drains*in the course of a few hours through crevasses in the great glacier.
