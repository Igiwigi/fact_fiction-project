General curves of M,, for a/t,, = 0 and 10 are plotted in figures 28 and 29. It will be seen
that for small values of a/t, = afte is practically independent of A,/#2, and J,/t4, as would

be expected from the near correspondence of equations (100) and (101). For higher values
of a/t,, this is no longer true in general. For practical beams, however, large a/t,, are
produced by small values of ¢,, which in turn means that J,/¢4, is large and the value of
t,
We thus see that the bending moment in the flange at the loading section may be repre-
sented with reasonable accuracy by equation (100). This equation does in fact set an upper

limit which will never quite be achieved in practice. Most practical beams fall about 10 %

short of it. For example, the undercarriage girder discussed in part I gives = : : = 0-422.

The results for the three mild steel experimental beams of part III are summarized in table 1.
