Except the first and only
pistol, none of the reports were attended with echoes or reverberatiom. But in most
cases, though not in all, after calling T could hear the ring of my voice for ten or
eleven seconds; and on one or two occasions when there were boats within half a mile
of us, I could distinctly hear the echoes from them. Without attempting to explain the
reverberation and echoes which have been observed, I will merely call attention to
the fact that in no case have I heard any attending the reports of the rockets, although
they seem to have been invariable with the guns and pistols. This fact suggests that
these echoes are in some way connected with the direction given to the sound. They
are caused by the voice, trumpets, and the siren, all of which give direction to the
sound ; but I am not aware that they have ever been observed in the case of a sound
which has no direction of greatest intensity.
