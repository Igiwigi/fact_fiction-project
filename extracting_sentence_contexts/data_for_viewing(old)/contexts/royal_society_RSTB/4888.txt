Considering the roughness of the basis the final conclusion is extraordinarily definite,
and leaves no doubt as to the order of magnitude of the required figures. To quote
from p. 84, “ If the age of the flowering plants is 100 million years, or thereabouts, the
doubling-period for species is probably of the order of some 2 or 3 million years : it is,
say, almost certainly over 1 million and less than 6 millions. The present rate of pro-
duction of (viable) specific mutations, amongst all flowering plants on the whole surface
of the globe, is almost certainly less than 1 in 10 years and more than one in 60 years :
it probaby lies between 1 in 15 and 1 in 30 years.” The results are, of course, of the
nature of averages, since the flowering plants are a very heterogeneous group.

It is clear that specific mutations must be events of the very greatest rarity ; and no
argument, as it seems to me, can be based on the fact that we have no knowledge or
experience of such phenomena. My work on the point entirely confirms the conclusion
of Dr. Wiix1s.*

If any conclusions stated in this Introduction or in the body of the paper seem to be
too confident, or at all dogmatic, I hope the reader will attribute the appearance to
inadvertence of wording, or a simple desire to avoid the wearisome reiteration of qualifying
phrases. I have no desire at all to be dogmatic: but Dr. Wiixis’s conclusions do
appear to me to explain a great range of facts, to be natural and reasonable in themselves,
and to present for the first time a conception of evolution at once so simple and so
definite that it can be expressed—even if only roughly owing to the gaps in our knowledge
—in quantitative terms, and quantitative deductions drawn. Admitting all the diffi-
culties of interpreting some results (Section [V)—and as I have said, they are considerable
