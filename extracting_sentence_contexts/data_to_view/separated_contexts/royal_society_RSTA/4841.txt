We may proceed in exactly the same manner as when the restricted permutations
were under view. ‘Taking the lattice corresponding to «;*a,’«, and arranging 6
different numbers in any way so that descending order is in evidence in the rows

For the whole of the permutations derived as above from the lattice which are, in
fact, the whole of the permutations of «,°a,’«; we derive a permutation function
