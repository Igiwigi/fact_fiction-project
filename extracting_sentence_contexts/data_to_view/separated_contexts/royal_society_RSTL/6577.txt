They are elements, and notwithstanding their colour and density, they take rank
after the transparent elementary gases. The perfectly transparent olefiant gas absorbs
more than one hundred and thirty times the amount absorbed by the untransparent
chlorine, and nearly fifty times the quantity absorbed by the intensely brown vapour of
bromine. TI cannot think this fact insignificant. Hitherto chemists have spoken to us
of elements, and we have helped ourselves to conceptions regarding them and their
compounds in the only way possible to our mental constitution. But our conceptions
remained purely subjective, nor were we acquainted with any physical trait which would
in any degree justify these conceptions.
