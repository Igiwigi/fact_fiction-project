as in the cotton, every fibre appears to be endowed with the capacity of liberating
energy in either of two very different ways; and whenever one part of the mass is made,
by the appropriate stimulus, to liberate its energy in one of these two ways, all other
parts of the mass do the same—and this no matter how far through the mass the
liberating process may have to extend. Now, employing this metaphor, what we have
to explain is why this capacity of dual response should exist in contractile tissnes, and
why certain slender lines of differentiated tissue should have the capacity, when them-
selves directly stimulated, of determining the explosive response. And to me it seems

hy that neither of these questions is answered by supposing that it is the ganglionic
= element which, when itself directly stimulated, acts as a detonator. That this may be
Z the case I do not dispute; for it is certainly, to say the least, a curious coincidence
DW that such a marked differentiation of function as the facts imply should everywhere
S accompany and be restricted to the ganglionic tracts*; but what I desire to insist upon
S is this—that even if the ganglionic element could be proved to be the detonating element,
2 the facts before us would not thus be accounted for. Doubtless it would be an
= interesting thing to know that a ganglion-cell may be able to originate two very
£5 different kinds of impulse, according as it, liberafes its energy spontaneously or in
z answer to direct stimulationf; but this knowledge would merely serve to transfer the
5 questions which now apply to the marginal and polypite tissues in general to the
2 ganglionic tissue in particular. Again, the supposition of the ganglia acting as
= detonators when themselves directly stimulated, would in no wise tend to explain why

S it is that the contractile tissues are capable of two such very different kinds of response.
