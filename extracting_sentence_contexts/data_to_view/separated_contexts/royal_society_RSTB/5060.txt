BAtrLEy WILLIs is in the main consistent with the
evidence in Yunnan, except as regards his interpretation of the last period, the Fon-ho. According to him central China had been worn down to a low plain which lasted into the
Pleistocene (Quaternary), when it was raised by a regional uplift of about 12,000 feet
(BatLey WILLIS, 1907, pp. 108, 111). This uplift is regarded as also having affected
the regions to the N. and W.; in fact, according to this view, the great mountains of
western China and the Tibetan tableland of east central Asia were raised from a little
above sea-level during the age of man. The similarities between the history of Yunnan and of central China are so close that
if Battey WILLIsâ€™s view be adopted for North China and the middle part of the Yangtze
basin, the plateau of Yunnan and the surrounding regions should also have been uplifted
during the Pleistocene. We saw, however, no evidence of any such great regional uplift.
