Let us compare the result, we obtained above,

H sin (¢ — ¥)/psin Y cos b cos 2b = constant
with WEIss’s result,
H sin (¢ — y)/I sin b cos = constant,

which he obtains in the case of pyrrhotite. Now pyrrhotite has a non-cubic structure,
and when we come to deal with non-cubic structures, exactly the same result will be
arrived at. It need only be observed here that the presence of the extra factor cos 2
in the denominator corresponds to the experimental fact that the deviation-eflect vanishes
when H is applied at 45° to either of the principal axes. II. The second observation that may be made is important.
