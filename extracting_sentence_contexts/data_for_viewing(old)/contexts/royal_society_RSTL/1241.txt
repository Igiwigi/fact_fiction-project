again by means of a small spring or wedge. It remained open $0 long as it descended ;
but when pulled up again, the wedge was thrown out of its place, and this obstacle
being removed, the box closed itself instantly, This was effected by means of a 8mall
fly-wheel, so confined as to admit of no motion during the descent of the machine; but
the moment it began. to ascend, the pressure of the water communicated tro the wheel
a rotatory motion, which, through a little mechanical contrivance, disengaged the
spring and closed the box,

Another, and more elaborate invention, of the same kind, (a description of which may
be found in the Â© Journal of Science and the Arts, Vol, V.) was devised last year by Sir
Humynry Davy, and was repeatedly used in the late yoyages towards the North Pole ;
andin fact, many of the specimens of waters from those regions, which I have examined,
were raised by means of that ingenious, though I apprehend, not unexceptionable ap-
paratus,

The principle of this instrument may be $tated in a few words, It consists in a
strong copper bottle of an oblong shape, closed at its neck by a stop-cock. To this
bottle is attached laterally, and in a parallel direction, a metallic tube closed at the
top and open at the bottom, with an air-tight piston moving within the tube. As the
open end of the tube therefore descends into the sea along with the bottle, the piston
which closes the orifice of the tube is gradually forced upwards into it, as the ma-
chine sinks, the air within it being proportionally compressed ; but when the piston
has reached a certain part of the tube, it meets with a catch and opens the cock of the
bottle, which, of course, instantly fills with water ; and there is an ingenious contriy-
