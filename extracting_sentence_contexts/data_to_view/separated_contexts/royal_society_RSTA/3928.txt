The largest error, in fact, is below 2%, whereas, in the case of a full LBM simulation
(orange dots in the inset of figure 3a), a 5% error is found to occur within the Knudsen layer. This
result is obtained strictly maintaining mass conservation within the system. In figure 3b, in fact,
the instantaneous number of particles present in the DSMC region is compared with the averaged

Figure 3. (a) Comparison of the velocity profiles averaged over time and normalized with Uyay from a hybrid simulation
(a = 0.2, blue line) and full DSMC simulation (red dots). In the inset, the relative errors as defined in equation (3.1) fora hybrid
and a full LBM simulation are shown. (6) Instantaneous number of particles within the DSMC region versus time step: mass
conservation, on average, is strictly obeyed. The average (N) deviates from the initial number of particles by less than 0.05%.

one, which, in turn, deviates from the initial one by less than 0.05%.
