But the coefficients Ã¾, y, 3, or 6, c, d, instead of being 80 many independent
Sibitrary quantities, may be given as rational functions of other quantities (if, for
Instance, the two conics are circles, radii R, r, and distance between the centres a, then
8, y, 3 will be functions of R, r, @): and it is in a case of this kind quite conceivable that
He functions [3], [4], &c., considered as functions of these new elements, should cease
EN be prime functions. In fact, in the case just referred to of the two circles (the
Sriginal case of the Porism as considered by Ftss), the functions [4], [6], &c., which
<a to'a polygon of an even, number of sides, appear to be each of them decom-
Joable into two factors: the memoir contains some remarks tending to show @ priori
hat in the case in question this decompoxition takes place. I was led to examine the
