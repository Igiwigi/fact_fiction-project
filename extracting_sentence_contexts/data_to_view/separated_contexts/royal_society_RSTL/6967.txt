The connected branch at each ensp crosses the axis of z, sweeps
conyexly towards the axis of 2, arrives at a minimum distance from it, and then goes off

to infinity. The value 4; for #® corresponds to —Þ for , and gives, as it ought to do, the cusp-
node. In fact the values Þ=—#, @=—2 correspond respectively to a cuspidal and to

a cusp-nodal line in the limiting surface whose sections we haye been considering. When the cutting plane is that of D itself, the section becomes a double cubic para-
bola and a single cubical parabola crossing each other at the origin. (7) Let & be an infinitesimal, and P=1-+e; then
