Such an analysis speaks for itself; it is quite clear that the pups as a whole tend
strongly towards the lighter forms, but it is equally clear that Numbers I. and III.
are intermediate between the two extremes II. and TV. In the considerably lighter
results of the former (I.) we probably see the proof that in the shorter stage, IL., the
influences are really more potent than in ILI., which is considerably longer. Similarly
Stage II. was passed in black surroundings in the case of III., and its results are
darker than those of I. In fact, in both I. and III. the colour in which Stage IJ. was
passed predominates in the result, or rather it is more accurate to say that the gilt
surroundings produce more effect in Stages I. and II. than in Stage IIT. alone.
It is also probable that the earliest, most sensitive, part of Stage III. had already
elapsed in most cases before transference took place. But further experiments will
show the inferior susceptibility of Stage III. under the most favourable conditions,
and indeed such a result might have been expected, for, although this stage is, as a
rule, so much longer than any other, the larval sensory surfaces are probably only in a
condition to be influenced in its most early part, for very rapid changes of pupal
construction and shape are going on beneath the surface. These would seem to
preclude the possibility of an external shell, shortly to be cast off, having any important
physiological relation with the organism beneath. But in Stage II. the larva retains
its shape, and the whole of its surface is in close relation with the colour into
