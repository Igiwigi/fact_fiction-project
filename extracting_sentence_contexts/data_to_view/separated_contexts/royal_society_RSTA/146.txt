These stripes are far more shallow
compared with the larger amplitude spots. This compound pattern emerges as for 11 = 1, r2 = 10,
stripes rather than spots will be the dominant Turing pattern. These two-dimensional simulations

highlight the fact that structures of different sizes can result from spatial heterogeneity, and in : =
some situations even distinct patterns can share the same space domain. While the simulations : =
in (a-c) show steady states, the simulation in (d) still evolves, with spots occasionally created on :3
the left boundary, slowly splitting as they migrate toward the centre, and then destroyed and : =
converted into mass for stripes. This behaviour persists even on the much longer timescale of :R
the simulation shown in (d), and is akin to how spatial heterogeneity resulted in spatio-temporal are
(rather than purely spatial) dynamics in [53,54]. :3

We have seen how spatially heterogeneous reaction and diffusion terms can result in a change 8
of pattern size or even structure.
