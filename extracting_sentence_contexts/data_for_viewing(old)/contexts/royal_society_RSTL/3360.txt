given rise to numerous speculations, but even this appears to me far less curious than
the following discovery.

If one of the above papers, when remoyed from the meronrial vapour, be dipped into
a 8olution of the bichloride of mercury, the drawing disappears, but after a few mi-
nutes it is seen, as if by magic, unfolding itself, and gradually becoming far more
beautiful and whiter than beforeâ€”delicate lines, before invisible or barely seen, are
now distinctly marked, and a rare and singular perfection of detail given to the
drawing.

It may appear at first sight that the bichloride of mercury dissolves off the metal
and deposits it again in the form of chloride (calomel). But this does not account
for the fact, that if the paper has been prepared with the nitrate of silyer, the mercury
disappears, and the drawing vanishes, the deposit taking place only on those parts
upon which light has acted but feebly, as, for instance, on the vernations of leaves,
leaving those portions of surface exposed to full luminous influence without a particle
of quicksilver. When the paper has been either a chloride or iodide, the effect is as
above, and the thickness of the deposit is as the intensity of the light has been; con
sequently the semi-tints are beautifully preserved. If the drawing remains too long
in the solution, the precipitate adheres to the dark parts and destroys the effect. The
singularity of this operation will be more striking if the picture has been soaked for
some time in a solution of the hyposuJphite of soda, and then dipped into the bichlo-
ride of mercury. As the drawing disappears, a series of circles, formed of a white
powder, appear to arise from the paper, generally commencing at the centre, and
slowly extending over its whole surface: the powder is afterwards deposited, and the
