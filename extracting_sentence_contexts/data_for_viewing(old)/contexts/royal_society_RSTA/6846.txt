general solution of (1-1) with this surface condition differs from (13-2) by a quantity which is
a solution of (1-1) which is zero over the surface; this represents a starting transient which
depends on the initial temperature distribution and tends to zero as the time increases (for
examples, see Williamson & Adams (1919), formulae (15), (16), (17)). Hence (13-2) repre-
sents the ultimate behaviour of the temperature through the solid. The quantity y(r)/D is
the lag between the times at which the temperature at the surface and the temperature at
the point r pass through any given value; this is independent of the rate of rise of surface
temperature, since the equation and boundary conditions determining y do not involve p.
For a symmetrically heated slab of thickness 2l, the time lag between surface and centre
is /?/2D, and for a symmetrically heated solid cylinder of radius a it is a’/4D; these values
follow directly from formulae (15) and (16) of Williamson & Adams (1919). The numbers 2
and 4 in the formulae for the time lag in these two cases are very closely related to the
coefficients 2 and 4 in equations (3-5) and (3-8) respectively. In fact, in both these cases the
distribution of temperature through the slab or cylinder ultimately become parabolic (see
formulae (15) and (16) of Williamson & Adams 1919), and then the fundamental approxima-
tions (3-2) of the present method is exact, so equations (3-5) and (3-8) are exact and can be
used to go from centre to surface in one interval 6x for the plane, and similarly for the cylinder;

and the time-lag property for constant rate of rise of surface temperature can easily be
deduced from these equations.

Now for a substance for which the diffusivity varies with the temperature, it has been

shown in § 9 that if the diffusivity does not vary greatly through the material at any one time
(though it may vary considerably in the course of time), the heat flow can be reduced
