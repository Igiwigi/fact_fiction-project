We might expect that he
ould have seen colours in his star of light near the eclipses. But when we have a
Fry feeble light changing its intensity ib is very difficult to appreciate differences in
our, and he had no light for comparison as we had. He depended largely for the
aeuracy of his results on two facts : (1) that he took a mean of 546 pairs of observa-
twns, 80 reducing the probable error to one twenty-third part of that of a single pair
> observations, and (2) that he used eclipses as high as the 21st eclipse, which reduces
tBy personal error of the eye observation to one forty-first+ part. We may add that
bs had five phases (which he calls U, u, V, v, and ») differing slightly, and he had
ensiderable latitude in placing any single observation in one or other of these phases. Yo may also add that into each s8et& of observations he introduced what he called
<Sectifications probables,” which assisted to eliminate discordances.
