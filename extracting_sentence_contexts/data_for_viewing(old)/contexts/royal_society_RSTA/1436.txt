has concluded, we then decode and collate the results and perform a Sobol sensitivity analysis
relative to our Qol (number of deaths over time).

We present the first-order Sobol sensitivity indices for each parameter in table 3 and in
figure 10. These global sensitivity indices [67] measure the fraction of the output variance (over
time here), that can be attributed to a single input parameter. During the first 20 days, all
parameters except for the (non-mild) recovery period have a significant effect on the number
of deaths. However, as the simulation progresses, the number of deaths is mainly sensitive to the
