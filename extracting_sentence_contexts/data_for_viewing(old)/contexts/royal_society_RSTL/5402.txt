We now know, from the experiments described above in the present paper, that the
numbers in the first column, and we may conclude with almost equal certainty, that
the numbers in the third also, ought to be each very nearly the mechanical equivalent
of the thermal unit. This having been ascertained to be 1390 (for the thermal unit
Centigrade) by the experiments on the friction of fluids and solids, communicated to
the Royal Society in 1849, and the mane having been found above to fall short of the

equivalent of heat produced, by about 5->, at the temperature of the air-experiments at

T7
present communicated, and by somewhat less at such a higher temperature as 30?,
we may infer that the agreement of the tabulated theoretical result with the fact is
perfect at about 30? Cent. Or, neglecting the small discrepance by which the work
truly required falls short of the equivalent of heat produced, we may conclude that

the true value of *E= for all temperatures is about 1390 ; and hence that if [W]

denote the numbers Bs for it in the preceding table, w the true value of Carnot's
function, and [] the yalue tabulated for any temperature in the © Account of
Carxor's Theory,” we must have, to a very close degree of approximation,
1390
