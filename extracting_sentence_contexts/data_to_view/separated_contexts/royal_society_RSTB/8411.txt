How is the form of the intended message constrained
by individual differences in the developing system, by for
instance, limited vocabulary or reduced memory capacity? This question assumes particular relevance when considering
language development in atypical populations; similar output
may arise from qualitatively different underlying processing
mechanisms (cf. [6]). Recent advances in eye-tracking technol-
ogy may elucidate these processes in new ways, by taking
advantage of the fact that eye-movements are temporally
linked to verbal output [7], and thus can reveal more about
the processes involved in conceptualization, formulation
and articulation of utterances, as they occur. This paper there-
fore considers the application of eye-tracking paradigms
to investigate language production in two common neuro-
developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) Figure 1. Opening page of the childrenâ€™s picture book, Frog, where are you? [8].
