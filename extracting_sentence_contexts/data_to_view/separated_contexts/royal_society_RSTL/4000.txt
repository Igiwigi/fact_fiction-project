On prolonging the passage of
the current for two seconds I obtained a contraction of 10?. TI left the circuit closed
for sixty minutes, and still the contraction was 7 on opening the circuit. Thus far
these numbers merely show the principal fact upon which I have insisted s0 strongly,

which is, the very different rate of reduction of the excitability observable in two nerves,
one of which is exposed to the passage of the direct, the other to that of the inverse
current. It was very important to compare the excitability of a nerve subjected to the pas-
sage either of the direct or of the inverse current, with that of a nerve left to itself
for an equal time.
