]. Introduction

A possibility of ignition and combustion enhancement in
various mixtures by means of the excitation of reactive
molecules was extensively discussed for the past years
(e.g. [1-3]). Interest in this problem is due to the fact that
both vibrationally and electronically excited molecules

react much faster than non-excited ones. Theoretical [4-9] and experimental [10-14] studies
showed that the rate constants of reactions with excited molecules can be by a factor 107-104
higher than those with ground state molecules. Both vibrationally and electronically excited
molecules can be produced with rather high efficiency in tailored electric discharge [2,15-17].
