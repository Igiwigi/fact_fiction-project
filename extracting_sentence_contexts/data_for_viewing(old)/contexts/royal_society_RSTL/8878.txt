MR. W. CROOKES ON REPULSION RESULTING FROM RADIATION. 327

dark or slightly luminous heat-rays—the fingers, a hot glass rod, hot copper, or a candle-
flame being used as the source of radiation. I quote the following sentencefrom par. 94:;—
« Although I most frequently speak of repulsion by heat, and in illustrating any of the
results obtained I generally use either the fingers or the flame of a spirit-lamp as a
convenient source of radiation, it must be clearly understood that these results are not
confined to the heating-rays of the spectrum, but that any ray, from the ultra-red to the
ultra-violet, will produce repulsion in a vacuum. I have already mentioned this fact in
my first paper (58, 68).”

A few experiments were tried on the effect of radiation on surfaces the reflecting or
radiating power of which was modified by coating them with various substances. In
par. 102, after describing a torsion-apparatus for quantitative work, I mention that the
surfaces of pith, as thin as possible, may be coated with lampblack or silver, or may retain
their natural s8urface ; in par. 108 I state, as the result of a long series of experiments with
this apparatus, that © the conducting-power for heat and condition of the surface (whether
coated with lampblack or consisting of polished metal) of the body on which radiation
falls materially influence the movements.” In par. 112 I again refer to the effect caused
by the physical condition of the surface ; and further on, in par. 116, I say, © A series of
experiments have been tried with a view to ascertain what influence the state of the surface
