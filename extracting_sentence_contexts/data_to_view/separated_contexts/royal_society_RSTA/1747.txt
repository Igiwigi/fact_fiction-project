MAxwe tt derives an expression in the magnetic case by statical considerations
based on the method of energy, and then seems to regard it as generally valid under
all circumstances. Objection has however been taken to MAXWELL’s expression
by certain writers who, basing themselves on the presumed analogy between the
dielectric and magnetic cases, prefer a form of expression differing from MAxWwELL’s
by a quantity which vanishes in the statical case considered but which is of funda-
mental importance in the derived problem of reducing the general forcive of
electrodynamic origin to a representation by means of an imposed stress system. It
appears in fact that the presence of this extra part in MAXwELt’s expression is
effective in securing the ordinary expression for the subsidiary term arising in the
induction, which has given rise to the conception of electromagnetic momentum, on
account of its being a perfect time differential. In the alternative form of the theory
the perfect time differential is not secured so that the idea of electromagnetic
momentum is lost.{ In his edition of MAxwELt’s treatise, J. J. Tomson adds a note
attempting to justify MaxweE.’s form of the expression, but his discussion can easily
be shown to be erroneous, for he fails to distinguish between the true and complete
currents of the theory, the latter containing a constituent, viz., the rate of change of
ethereal displacement, which is not affected by the magnetic part of the complete
electromagnetic forcive; nevertheless, the later discussions of the question from the
point of view of the theory of electrons have confirmed MaxwE v's original expression
for the magnetic forcive, but they apparently still give the alternative expression for
the dielectric case.
