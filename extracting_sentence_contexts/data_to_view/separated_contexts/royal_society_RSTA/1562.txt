In addition, this structure supports the efficacy of signal transmission and synchronization : =

Owing to the fact that SWN has a complex but economic structure, it is natural to ask if there [3
is a favourable complexity level or what is its impact on signal processing in neuron populations. :2
Following this motivation, Ozer et al. examined the SR phenomenon in the Newmanâ€”Watts SWN : 8
and showed that at a certain degree of small-worldness provided by an optimal amount of new if
link addition, an adequate noise level can induce emergence of SR across the whole network. : S
This implies that local periodic driving, i.e. subthreshold signal applied to a single neuron in the : Ss
network, can be transmitted through the whole network in a maximal correlation with overall : Ss
electrical activity [60]. Furthermore, they determined the randomness parameter of SWN, the 1a

coupling strength and the driving frequency of the pacemaker as the main actors of signal
transmission, and found by measuring Q values of entire network activity that there is also an
optimal level for each parameter to obtain the best SR performance. On the other hand, SR behaviour can sometimes rely on transmission dynamics, which may
be associated with some necessary biological facts. Yu et al. analysed population behaviour
with transmission delays, which are inevitable in communication between actual neurons, as
well as different control parameters such as noise intensity and rewiring probability [70]. They
investigated SR in Watts-Strogatz type SWN of electrically coupled Rulkov model neurons.
