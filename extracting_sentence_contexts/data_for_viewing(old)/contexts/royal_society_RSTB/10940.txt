examples are the vertebrate eye or the long hind legs of grass-
hoppers and anurans [3]. Interestingly, because such body
parts are often viewed against the surrounding parts of the
body, the organism in question has full genetic and develop-
mental control over both the feature to be concealed and its
immediate visual background, and therefore concealment of
such features could provide opportunities for evolutionary
perfection of camouflage: they could also provide researchers
with opportunities to test ideas about camouflage, without

the interference of background variation. This requires that

surrounding are histologically different, such as the eye and
the skin, scales, feather or fur surrounding it, it may be
easy to identify selection for concealment of a feature.

Coincident disruptive coloration (row 8, table 1) may
provide a means to camouflage morphological features that
could reveal the presence or identity of an animal [3].
Strategic placement of patches of separate colours with a
