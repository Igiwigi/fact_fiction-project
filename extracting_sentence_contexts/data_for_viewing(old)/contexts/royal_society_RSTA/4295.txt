with measured values a = 1.0000, 6 = 0.9345, y = 1.0645 (+0.0002). This particular alloy is : S
interesting in the present context since it was tuned by compositional changes to have Az =a =1 : 8S
where Az is the middle eigenvalue of Uj. (Note that, due to the structure of the energy wells, all 10

Uj,...,Un have the same eigenvalues, which in this case are a, 6 and y.) Given Uj the condition
42 =1is necessary and sufficient that the equation

RU; —I=a@n (3.5)

has a solution R € SO(3) and a,n € R®. In fact, if 42 = 1, there are precisely two solutions (Rj, a1 ®
n,) and (Rz, a2 @ nz) of (3.5). The alloy discussed here,! TisgNigo,75Pdo25, was preceded by the
synthesis of the nearby alloy Tis9Niz9Pd1;, which also has 42 quite close to 1. High-resolution
transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images [35] of Tis9Niz9Pd1, revealed many of these
‘exact (untwinned) interfaces’, and the measured angle in R and the measured values of a and n
were shown to agree well with solutions of (3.5).

The existence of the two solutions allows us to construct a deformation similar to that of §2 but
using the two solutions of (3.5) and the methods of this section. For this purpose, we choose the
first solution (Rj, a; @ n)) of (3.5), and we make the particular choices Rg = R} and, say, yy = 0 to
specify the group generated by h, and e = a[1, —1, 0] for the group generated by the translation t (o
is chosen conveniently). We also choose a region 2’ consisting of a parallelepiped in the reference
configuration bounded by planes of normal nz from the second solution a distance |e| apart. This
