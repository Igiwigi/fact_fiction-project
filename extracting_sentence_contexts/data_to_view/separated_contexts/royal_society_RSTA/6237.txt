For example: in [17], sea ice drift can be substantially altered in the aftermath of energetic wave
events. In [99], FSD-influenced granular mechanics are shown to play an important role in setting
the width and variability of the MIZ. More highly broken floes permit higher contact between the ice and the ocean, by the simple
fact that they move independently, revealing small patches of open water. These small regions
reduce total sea ice concentration and permit more sunlight. More floe-like systems, for example,
in the Southern Ocean, may permit significant amounts of sunlight to reach through them
in summer.
