fact the precipitations of E.M.F. induced by the CO, are seen to be imposed upon a’
gentle curve of descent. If, on the other hand, Experiment B be examined, a case where at the com-
mencement the outer surface is positive to the inner, the following points will be
evident. In the first place the negativity of the inner surface is diminishing, a fact
that has already been alluded to in a previous section of this paper. In the second
place the exposure of the skin to the action of the CO, leads, in contradistinction to
the former normal case of Experiment A, to an augmentation of the E.M.F. of the
current in contra-normal direction, but, as before, upon the admission of air the
effect is cut out, and the ordinary diminution of negativity of the inner surface
continues. In the third place it is seen that though the skin lay for 8 minutes
in CO,, at the first application, recovery from the effect was noticed within 2} minutes,
whale the skin was still subject to the action of the gas, and the effect was relatively a
small one, while in the third application, though the action was only allowed to
continue for 1 minute a far greater effect was produced, suggestive of a diminution of
vital resistance, though the rapid admission of air excluded any observation as to
whether recovery could have still occurred while the gas was still present.
