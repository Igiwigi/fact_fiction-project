tive framework, we then describe ways to conceptualize the
access and phenomenal consciousness as well as the (in our
opinion) closely related concept of working memory.

2. Background for the reorganization of
elementary functions framework

The primary motivation for the original development of the
REF model was to obtain a neurocognitive understanding
that can simultaneously account for both of the two appar-
ently contradictive phenomena of functional localization
and functional recovery after focal acquired brain injury.
The fact that the regional specialization of the brain involves
at least a certain degree of cognitive functional localization
has been well demonstrated in numerous human studies
applying neuroimaging (e.g. [17,18]) or the symptoms associ-
ated with focal brain injury (e.g. [19-26]). Frequently, human
studies of the consequences of acquired brain injury may be
flawed by the lack of information regarding pretraumatic per-
formance, the often limited group sizes and the need to resort

to suboptimal control groups. Obviously, human studies are
essential (not least when dealing with phenomena such as
language and/or consciousness), but there is a need to sup-
plement such studies with animal models that can provide
