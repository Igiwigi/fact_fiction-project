Ni alloys, which have excellent corrosion resistance, are, therefore, selected for this
type of demanding application, especially when H2S-containing streams are involved. Ni
alloys, particularly those that are precipitation hardenable (PH), are indeed the most used
engineering materials for heavy wall completion equipment in HPHT sour wells and deep
subsea production equipment due to their high strength, ductility and toughness over a
broad range of temperatures. All this is combined with exceptional SSC and stress corrosion
cracking (SCC) resistance, which becomes, in fact, one of the most relevant limiting factors
for high-strength super-austenitic and duplex stainless steels when considered as alternatives
to LASs. Table 1 includes the most common PH Ni alloys used in oilfield technology. As shown in
table 1, these alloys contain significant amounts of chromium (Cr) and molybdenum (Mo) to
guarantee chemical stability in corrosive environments.
