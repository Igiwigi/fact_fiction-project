In the case of the 4th brain, 39 blocks were prepared, and of these 34 contained
both laminations, 4 the visuo-psychic only, and 1 the visuo-sensory only. From the
5th brain, 20 blocks were removed, of which 19 contain both laminations, and 1 the
visuo-sensory only. The smaller number of blocks in this case is of course due to the
smaller size of the lobe examined.

Finally, from the 6th brain, 20 blocks were again cut, and of these 11 contained
both laminations, and 9 the visuo-psychic lamination only. The large number of
regions containing visuo-psychic lamination only is here due to the small development
of the area of special lamination.

The greater number of the blocks were cut by the freezing method, which is
probably responsible for the fact that not a single error of orientation occurred
throughout the investigation. The sections were consequently cut, stained, mounted,
and drawn before their different appearances had been forgotten. After being cut,
the sections were prepared by the Nissl method, and by one or other of the modifica-
tions of the Weigert-Pal method, which I have described in previous papers (30). In
the case of a certain number of the more important blocks the paraffin method was
used, and the sections were stained by the Nissl, or by a modification of the Weigert-
iron method, a 2 per cent. solution of iron-alum being substituted for the tinct. ferri
perchloridi usually employed. The latter method was largely used in the case of
brains 5 and 6, as the soft tissue of which they were composed did not lend itself
readily to the freezing method,

The sections were then traced by means of a camera obscura, in order to form the
