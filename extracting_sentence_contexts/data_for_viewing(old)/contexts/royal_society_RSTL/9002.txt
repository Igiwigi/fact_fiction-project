I CAPTAIN NOBLE AND MR. F A. ABEL ON FIRED GUNPOWDER. 131

We have pointed out, however, that although in muskets and small arms the loss of
heat arising from communication to the bore is yery considerable, it is comparatively
unimportant in very large guns. In our calculations also we have taken 2, the specific
heat of the non-gaseous portion of the charge, at its mean value. It should, however,
be taken at a higher value, since the specific heat must increase rapidly with the
temperature ; and this difference no doubt more than compensates for the 1oss of heat to
which we have referred as not being taken into account.

Our hypothesis as to a portion of the charge remaining unconsumed until the pro-
jectile approaches the muzzle, is confirmed by the well-known fact that in short guns, or

Q where powder of high density or very large size is employed, considerable quantities
NJ sometimes escape combustion altogether.

E The appearance of pellet. or pebble powder which has been ignited and afterwards
bay extinguished in passing through the atmosphere is well known to artillerists.

Â£ The general appearance (and in this appearance there is wonderful uniformity) is
= represented in Plate 15. fig. 5, and gives the idea of the combustion having proceeded
S from centres of ignition.
