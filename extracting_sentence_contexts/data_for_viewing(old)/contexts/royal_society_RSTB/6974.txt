definitely terrestrial habitat becomes still stronger in the case of the larger plants of
the Senni Beds. In South Wales the change indicated by the appearance of these
plants occurs at the base of the Senni Beds and within a few hundred feet of rock with
no stratigraphical break. It seems clear that the change in the flora here is not
evolutionary but ecological. It can be correlated with the alterations in the physical
conditions indicated by the increase of sandy over muddy sediments and by the decline
in the fish fauna.

Very special interest attaches to the continued presence in the Senni Beds, along
with the large and definite terrestrial vascular plants, of the peculiarly organized
Nematophytales (Prototaxites, Nematothallus). Nematothallus is abundant and readily
demonstrated at Brecon Beacons Quarry and occurs at Llanover, Talybont and
Kemeys. Prototaxites also has been found in all these exposures. The most striking fact,
however, concerns the occurrence at Llanover not merely of fragments of Prototaxites
but of large specimens. It is not necessary to return here to the general question of
the possible terrestrial habitat of these plants, which was fully considered in relation
to the Downtonian flora (Lang 1937). It need only be pointed out that the presence
of Prototaxites in the Senni Beds affords strong additional support for regarding the
Nematophytales as land plants.

The desirability of further collecting and detailed work on all stages in the remarkable
and continuous succession of plant remains from the Silurian to the Senni Beds will
be evident. There is no advantage at present in entering upon the general questions
involved further than the remarks in the preceding paragraphs. What is needed is the
building up of our knowledge not only of the morphology and structure of the plants
