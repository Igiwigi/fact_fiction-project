test experiment would be afforded by taking young larval Termites, and rearing
them in captivity on thoroughly sterilised wood, excluding them from any associa-
tion with older individuals containing Protozoa. If it is possible to rear Termites
to the adult stage under these conditions, | would be prepared to abandon my belief
in the existence of symbiosis between the Protozoa and their hosts. A very wide
and promising field, for Protozoological research, is likely to be afforded by a study
of the intestinal Protozoa of wood-feeding Arthropods, which have so far almost
entirely escaped attention. Lxerpy mentions (1881, p. 427) that in old stumps and
decaying logs inhabited by Leucotermes flavipes, the Myriapod Spirobolus moarginatus

and the coleopterous insect Passalus commutus are also found. Both the latter
species, he adds, sustain a multitude of “ parasites” (as he terms them), and it isa
remarkable fact that all three animals just enumerated use the same food, and, even
at times, occupy the same habitation. It would be a matter of great interest to
study the contents of the intestine in the larvze and adults of many coleopterous

families which subsist upon wood, more especially the Ipidee (Scolytida:), Buprestidee, —
Cerambycide, and Bostrichide. Among the Lepidoptera the wood-feeding larve
of the families Aegeriiadze and Zeuzeride, and the genus Trypanus (Cossus), like-
wise afford suitable subjects for study. Porrier (1911) has investigated an apparent
instance of symbiosis in the case of the larva of a Noctuid moth Nonagria arundinis BF.
