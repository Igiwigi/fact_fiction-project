Tis affinities must,
therefore, be with Drym@eca, Orthotomus, Prinia, &c., or with the Reed-Warblers,
Acrocephalus, Bradypterus, &c. Tt cannot he referred to Orthotomus, as all the
members of the latter genus have the tail shorter than the wing, or ahout equal to
it in length. In true Drymaeecs the tail is always longer than the wing, and 80 it is
in Prinia, but in Apalis the wings and tail are about equal, s0 that T can hardly
understand Mr. G. R. Gray's 8uggestion that D. rodericana resembled Apalis. The shorter and broader hill, the minuteness of the rictal bristles, and the fact of the
first primary being equal to the inner secondaries in length, all show that Apalis is
not the genus to which the present bird could he referred, though in the © Handlist ”
a clean 8weep is made of all the Grass-Warhlers and their allies, which are sunk
into one enormous genus Drymoica. Tt remains therefore clear that the Rodriguez
Warbler must be referred either to Prinia, to Drym@ca, or to the immediate
vicinity of the Reed-Warblers. After comparing them I have come to the con-
clusion that it should he referred to the last-mentioned group of Warblers, as its
abnormally long bill and strong rictal hristles separate it off from Dryma@ce and
Prinia.
