The other step to be made, and with which I shall commence, consists in showing that
the number of terms in the expression last above written, considered as a function of
(m—i—2)th degree of (i+1) variables, is never greater than the entire number of
ways in which, (2--1) quantities out of , quantities may be equated to the remaining
(m—1i—1) quantities, viz. each of the first set respectively to all the same, or all dif-
ferent, or 80me the same and some different ;/ in short, in any manner each of the, i+1
quantities with, some one or another (without restriction against repetitions) of the
m—1—1 remaining quantities. This latter number being in fact the number of ways
in which (m—i—1) quantities may be combined '(i+1) together with repetitions
