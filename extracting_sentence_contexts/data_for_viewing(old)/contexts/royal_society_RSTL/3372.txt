1. THE influence of bodies, not permanently magnetic, on the compass needle,
has'led to some further researches in magnetism of singular importance. The
valuable papers of M. Araco and other eminent philosophers on this subject,
communicated to the Royal Academy of Sciences, together with those of our
no less talented countrymen which have appeared in the Royal Society's Trans-
actions, are calculated to excite a deep interest in physics. In presenting to
the Royal Society, after such valuable contributions to science, an account of
some inquiries which I have myself been led to make in this branch of natural
knowledge, I am encouraged by the belief, that whilst the deductions are for
the most part derived from simple and direct experiments, the investigation
has been carried on under new conditions; and that although some facts already
made known, have been again referred to, it will neyertheless be found to con-
tain results of sufficient consequence to render it not unworthy of notice.

I have been particularly led to persevere in this investigation, at various
times, from having observed (Edinburgh Journal of Science, vol. v. p. 325.)
that the reciprocal action of a rotating metallic disc, and a magnetic bar, is
not considered by M. Araco as the result of any magnetism induced in the
dise, but is attributed by him to some new force as yet undiscovered :—and
also, from the circumstance, that the magnetic susceptibility of non-metallic
bodies, seems not to have been in many instances satisfactorily established:—
two inquiries of considerable importance.
