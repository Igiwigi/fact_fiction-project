The fact that nearly all lines which make their appear-
ance at low temperatures only are lines which widen easily seems to be suggestive. Spectra of the negative pole. â€”It has long been known that in many gases the glow
surrounding the negative electrode has a different colour from the remainder of the
discharge. This colour appears generally more blue to the eye than that of the posi-
tive discharge, and, this fact was the cause that a certain blueness was often ass0ciated
with the idea of negative electricity. When examined with the spectroscope, it is
found that the negative glow has a s8pectrum of its own, different, of course, in different
gases. Here, also, I think, it will be found simpler to assume that a definite molecular
combination is formed at the negative pole than to suppose that exterior forces pecu-
liar to the pole modify the period of vibration, The following experiments seem to me
to support strongly, if not to prove, this view.
