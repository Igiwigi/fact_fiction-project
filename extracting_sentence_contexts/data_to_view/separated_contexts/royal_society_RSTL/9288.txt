I use, as will be seen, a quadric function 4(a, h, bYm, 3)? with even
integer values of m, 1, instead («, h, bXm, n)* with even or odd values ; and I write
the other term Zri(mu+nv) instead of mu+1v ; this comes to affecting the arguments
1, v with a factor mz, 80 that the quarter periods (instead of being Tz) are made to
be =1.

2, We write

= »)=4(@, h, bYm, n)*+mi(mu+nn),

AND DOUBLE THETA-FUNCTIONS., 899

and in like manner

=” NY $)=1(a, h, bXmb+a, n+B)*+ Li (m+a)(u+y)(n+B)(v+8)},

and prefixing to either of these the functional symbol exp. we have the exponential
of the function in question, that is, e with the function as an exponent. We then write, as the definition of the double theta-functions,

a, m+&, n+
o(= al v)=ZE exp (PE+ wy
where the summation extends to all positive and negative even integer values
(zero included) of m and n respectively : «, B, y, 6 might denote any quantities what-
ever, but for the theta-functions they are regarded as denoting positive or negative
integers ; this being 80, it will appear that the only effect of altering each or any of
them by an even integer is to reverse (it may be) the sign of the function ; and the
distinct functions are consequently the (4*=)16 functions obtained by giving to each
> of the quantities «, B, y, 6 the two values 0 and 1 s8nccessively. Z 3, We thus have the double theta-functions depending on the parameters («, h, b)
= which determine the quadric function (a, hk, b X m, 1)? of the disappearing even

5 integers (m, n) : and on the two arguments (w, v) : in the symbol - 4, which is called

'S the characteristic, the characters «, B, y, 6 are each of them =0 or 1; and we thus
S have the 16 functions,

S The parameters («, h, b) may be real or imaginary, but they must be snch that
&S reducing each of them to its real part the resulting function ( * Jm, n)* is invariable
EZ in its sign, and negative for all real values of m2 and n : this is in fact the condition
& for the convergency of the series which give the values of the theta-functions.

5. As already remarked, the definition of

actually occasion to consider functions of this form where they are not integers : in
particular, «, Þ may be either or each of them of the form, integer +}.
