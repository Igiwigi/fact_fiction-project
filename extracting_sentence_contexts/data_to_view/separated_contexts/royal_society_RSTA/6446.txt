The function xdv/dx is pro-
portional to dv/dt, and thus his dotted curve is of just the same kind as the other,
excepting close to the surface. Now let us return to the expression for the integral stretching, viz. :—

Thus it appears that the integral effect is always a stretching, and that it is the

same in amount at whatever speed the globe cools. The fact that, if the globe cools

suddenly, the integral effect must be stretching has been pointed out by Mr. Davison. If we differentiate (10), we have
