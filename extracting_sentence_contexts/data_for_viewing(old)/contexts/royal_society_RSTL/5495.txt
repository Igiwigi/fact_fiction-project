tion with the advance in the number of rectifications was less marked, but still decided,
and after six distillations I was able to procure a portion boiling as low as 98*5.

It appearing evident that, previous to attempting any examination, it would be es8en-
tial to obtain the crude hydrocarbons of nearly constant boiling-point, they were sub-
mitted to a tolerably complete fractionation, during which there were made, altogether,
no less than one thousand distillations.

An opinion has been hazarded by some persons, that in processes of fractional distil-
lation a continual breaking up is taking place, which they suppose to account for the
variations in the point of ebullition : that the supposition is incorrect will be admitted
by all chemists who have given close attention to processes of this kind, and the ques
tion is placed beyond doubt by the fact that the variation becomes less as the distilla-
tions are more numerous, and, at last, the fractions distil almost entirely between the
points at which they last came over, and doubtless might, if sufficient time was expended
on them, be obtained perfectly steady.

As s00n as by the means described fractions were obtained of almost constant boiling-
points, I proceeded to ascertain whether the fluids consisted of more than one substance,
and, passing over the preliminary trials, it was s00n found that more than one series of
Hodies were present. This was proved by the deportment of the mixed hydrocarbons
