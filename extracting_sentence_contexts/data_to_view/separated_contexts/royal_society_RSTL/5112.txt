Magnetical and Meteorological Observations at Hobarton, and
Vol. IH. Magnetical and Meteorological Observations at Toronto (now in the press),
with the object of investigating some of the laws which govern the occurrence of the
larger magnetic disturbances, I have found that at these two tations, as well as at
the two others, the evidence is complete of the existence of laws of a periodical
character: the facts appear to be important materials towards elucidating the general
laws of disturbances, and I therefore venture to communicate them to the Royal
Society. The observations which have been examined are comprised between September
1842 and September 1847 at St. Helena, and between July 1841 and July 1846 at
the Cape of Good Hope; these periods include all the hourly observations that could
be made available for discussion.
