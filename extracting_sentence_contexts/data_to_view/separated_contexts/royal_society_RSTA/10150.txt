The absorption
was so complete as to leave no visible gas residue. This test assured us that no air
was left in our chlorine. The fact that the chlorine first evolved was allowed to
escape was a safeguard against the possible presence of bromine or iodine, for any
bromide in the silver chloride would have been decomposed by the chlorine, and the
evolved bromine would have been carried over with the chlorine first escaping. The chlorine bulb (immersed in a cooling mixture of solid carbonic acid and ether
contained in a silvered Dewar tube) was then filled with liquid chlorine. The current
was increased and the condensation allowed to proceed until the liquid reached the
level of a circular line etched on the bulb, when the current was stopped.
