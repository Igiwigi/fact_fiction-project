In the Ariciadz especially, it may be observed that the peculiarly
areolated tissue in which the ova are contained is distinguishable into two parts, one of
which is densely and intimately connected with the blood-vessels (se fig. 16; fig. 17 ch),
the other forming a mere utricular receptacle to the generative elements (fig. 17 a, a;
fig. 15 0). There is no doubt .that that portion (fig. 17 e h; tig. 16 46) which is ulti-
mately bound up with the vascular system, is designed to supply a fluid secretion, from
the blood-proper, which is necessary to the further growth of the generative produets. This illustration confirms what has been constantly observed during the foregoing
descriptions, that the blodd-proper system in the Annelids is much more intimately
connected with the process and the organs of reproduction than the chylaqueous fluid,
This important fact implies evidently a difference of vital and chemical compoxition in
these two fluids. The higher fluid is used for a higher purpose, the lower for a lower. The segmental organs in the Ariciadz occupy the floor of each annular compartment
(as shown in fig. 17 45 and 75).
