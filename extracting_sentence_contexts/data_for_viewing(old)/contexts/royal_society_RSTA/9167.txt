5 The ordinary theory of the action of a Lummer Gehreke plate on monochromatic
A light is, of course, familiar, but in its extension to a problem of this nature it becomes
somewhat cumbrous. We have found it possible, however, to devise a more simple
treatment of the theory of the plate which can be applied not only to the present case
but apparently to all practical cases in which the use of the plate is necessary.
We append, therefore, an account of this method, which is to some extent empirical,
although it is not difficult to show that it is equally accurate. It is rendered the
more necessary in that even the strict theory has apparently not been worked out
completely for lines which are not monochromatic, but have a definite breadth as in
the present experiments, where in fact the breadth is itself a matter of investigation,

The ordinary theory of the Lummer Gehreke plate is, as stated above, well known
so far as monochromatic radiation is concerned. If light falls on the plate, as in the
figure (fig. 4), and if « and 8 are the rays respectively reflected once, and refracted
twice and reflected once, their path difference is D = 2 ud cos 7 where « is the index
of the plate for the particular wave-length, rv is the angle of refraction, and d is the
thickness of the plate. When the complete system of multiple reflections is considered,
