The table may now be completed.

Another fact that may be useful in completing the table, is the following. If two
classes are similar, save that operations of the one class contain a cycle of order p, and the
corresponding operations of the other class leaves the p symbols unaltered, then, p being
prime, the characteristics of the two classes are congruent mod. p.

For example, the characteristics of the class (3*) are congruent to the characteristics
of the class (193), and these in turn are congruent to those of the class (1°), mod. 3. In
finding the characters of the symmetric group of order 8!. for example, when these
values of the characters for the first 15 classes have been found, as has been shown,
there remain seven more classes of which one is the class (35). The characteristics
