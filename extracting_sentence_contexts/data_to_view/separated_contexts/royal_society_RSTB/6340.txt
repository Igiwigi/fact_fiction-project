It is clear, however, that an electrical stimulus
could switch the cycle over from the oestrous to the luteal phase. FRimpcoop and
Pincus (1935) found that ovulation could supervene after stimulation of the cervical
sympathetic ganglia, but, as in our experiments, there was a delay of 12 to 14 hours
beyond the normal interval, the result in this respect being in agreement with our
observations. FrrepGoop and Prncusâ€™s experiments are remarkable in view of the
fact recorded above that ovulation can occur in the rabbit after complete cervical
sympathectomy. One may, perhaps, interpret the results on the assumption of
more than one nervous path and more than one mechanism for the initiation of the
processes. Harerrus (1934), however, could not produce ovulation after cervical
sympathetic stimulation.
