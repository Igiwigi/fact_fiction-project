to say, they are approximately the same size as the spores from which they were derived.
For this reason we are definitely of the opinion that no fusion has taken place between
the time they emerged from the spores in the soil and their appearance in the root
hairs of the first host plant. The young swarm spore now migrates further down the
root hair, and there the nucleus divides, and a small plasmodium is formed (see Plate 21,
fig. 6). A mature plasmodium may possess up to thirty nuclei at this stage. Usually
as a result of this development the root hair swells out, though as a general rule it is the
lower half only which becomes enlarged. These plasmodia grow very rapidly, and
their life, as judged by the age of the seedlings, does not exceed two or three days.
When mature, each nucleus becomes surrounded by a mass of cytoplasm, and walls
are laid down between them, cutting up the plasmodium into a number of separate
bodies. CHupp. among others, has observed these, and considers that they are spores.
This view is, however, incorrect. They are, in fact, zoosporangia. The existence of
a second method of reproduction by means of zoosporangia was first described by one
of the present writers (9) in 1928. In the genus Ligniera the zoosporangia represent a
second method of reproduction which all plasmodia were potentially able to adopt.
In P. brassice such is not the case, as zoosporangia only develop in the root hairs.
After the separation of the plasmodia into zoosporangia, the nucleus of each divides
up to give four, or sometimes six, nuclei, and around each a small mass of protoplasm
collects. The wall of the zoosporangium, which is quite thin, collapses, and the zoo-
spores make their way to the exterior. The zoosporangia vary in size from 6 ». to about
6-5 u in diameter. The zoospores are small, spindle-shaped bodies about 1-5 y in
