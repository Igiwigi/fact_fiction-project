This is reflected in figure 1a: the threshold Ks, required for
metastable populations is higher for additive deleterious
alleles (dashed lines) than recessive alleles (solid lines). Moreover, because genetic load in this drift-dominated
regime depends only weakly on the mutational input Ku,
the threshold Ks, is largely independent of Ku (different col-
ours). Finally, for all parameter combinations, the threshold
Ks, increases as the mutation target becomes larger: this
simply reflects the fact that for the total load to be less than
the baseline growth rate, the load per locus must be lower
(requiring stronger selection) if deleterious variants segregate
at a greater number of loci. Accordingly, for very large
mutation targets 2LU = 2L(u/ro) =1, the total load will
exceed ro (and populations will fail), irrespective of the
strength of selection against deleterious mutations. The critical selection thresholds for metastability shown in
figure 1a are computed by neglecting demographic stochasti-
city, ie. by assuming ¢=19K to be very large.
