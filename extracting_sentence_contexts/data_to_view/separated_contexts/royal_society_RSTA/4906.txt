It should also be remarked that large white-hot molten drops do not form on the
silver poles as they do in the case of iron, but that the silver seems to be vaporised
without previous melting. There is, moreover, the additional evidence that the lines
a and ¢, which are intimately connected with the formation of these bands, remain
emission lines throughout. That the silver lines really disappear and are not hidden by the continuous spectrum
is borne out by the fact that on one photograph at a high pressure an impurity line
(of lead) remains visible against the continuous background. The disappearance of the line spectrum seems due to the replacement of the old
vibrating systems by new ones, which are perhaps new and complicated atomic
combinations. Whether these are aggregates of silver atoms, or combinations of silver
and oxygen atoms, remains to be tested—a most valuable research would be the
examination of the silver spectrum under pressure in an atmosphere of hydrogen.
