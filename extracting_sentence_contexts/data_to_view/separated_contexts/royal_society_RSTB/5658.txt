After a certain number of leaves had been laid down, the
divergence angles approached again the normal value of 136°-3. The first few
angles after the angle between I, and I, generally oscillated above and below the
normal, as can be seen from the Table, but the oscillations were not always
regular. The fact that I, arose on the opposite side of the apex from the normal when the
angle I,-I, exceeded 180° supports the theory, mentioned in the introduction, that each
primordium arises in the largest gap between the previous primordia. For I, occupied
the larger gap between I, and I;, on whichever side of the apex it lay. Moreover, it is in
accordance with this theory, that when I, arose on the opposite side of the apex from
that on which it would normally have arisen, the genetic spiral continued in the reverse
direction from then onwards.
