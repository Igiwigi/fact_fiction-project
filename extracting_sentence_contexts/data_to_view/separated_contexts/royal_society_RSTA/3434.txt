500 PROFESSOR HENRY A. MIERS: AN ENQUIRY INTO

the total reflection method can be relied upon, and that there is no sudden break in
the curve. In this particular series there is a considerable dislocation of the curve between
Nos. 10 and 11, due partly to the fact that the corner of the rectangular trough used
in this experiment interfered with the illumination, and partly that, for fear of
causing the liquid to erystallise, it was not efficiently stirred until this point was
reached. For this reason the series is not plotted on Diagram I.

Table TT. represents a series of isolated observations made by the method of total
reflection upon saturated solutions at the ordinary temperature. In Nos. 1 to 4,
which relate to the same solution, the temperature was not recorded ; but the effect
of approximation to crystals in the solution is here traced; No. 1 is a saturated
solution ; in No, 2 a few small crystals have been placed in the trough; in No. 3 a
mounted crystal is brought near to the prism; in No. 4 it is brought almost into
contact with the prism.
