belief in conspiracy theories is trait-like: people who believe existing traditions, if individuals fail to avail themselves of


effective new strategies for the prevention of infection (e.g. vac-
cines), this behavioural decision increases the likelihood that
they will become infected and, consequently, will transmit
the infection to others. The resulting increase in Ro implies a
faster rate of infection within the population and, potentially,
the emergence of otherwise preventable epidemics.
Additional population-level health consequences follow
from the fact that, in many modern societies, individuals’ atti-
tudes influence the laws and public policies created by
governments. Recall that the perceived threat of infection can
lead individuals to endorse more conservative political atti-
tudes [46]. To the extent that these perceptions are shared
widely within a population (as they may be whenever infectious
diseases receive wide coverage in popular media), one potential
implication is the election of more conservative politicians
and the formation of governments with more conservative
political platforms. These platforms inform the passage of
policies, budgets and laws that can have enduring effects on
population-wide health outcomes. The exact nature of those
enduring health outcomes may depend on exactly how conser-
