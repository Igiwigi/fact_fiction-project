Although the position of the polar front [104,105] and the conditions that influence it [20]
are still poorly defined, there is evidence that warming is leading to changes in its intensity
[20,106]. Atlantic surface waters are heating up at approximately 0.4°C decade™!, and Arctic
waters at approximately 0.6°C decade~ [22], weakening the temperature differential between
the opposing water masses and allowing a north-eastward intrusion of Atlantic waters into the
Barents Sea [107]. The fact that changes in species activity and behaviour that affect important
aspects of the ecosystem (nutrient concentrations) are maximized at the frontal edge, and that this
boundary represents a distinction (high south-low north) in faunal mediation capacity, highlights
the significance of this boundary for defining functional precincts and ecological boundaries
[30]. Changes in species and functional groups between seasons, attributed to the presence of
more labile organic matter reaching the seafloor in summer, provide anecdotal support for this
assertion [64]. Indeed, recent work has shown that such spatial-temporal changes are linked to the
functional traits of organisms because environmental context—in particular sea ice and bottom


water temperature [35]—influences the trait expression of individuals which, in turn, dictates net
community-level behaviour and ecosystem functioning [99,108].
