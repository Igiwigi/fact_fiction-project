the inhibitor, we must suppose that we are also concerned with some other
factor, or factors, rendering possible the manifestation of*the polydactylous
effect in spite of the presence of the inhibitor. But although we have devised
various schemes along these lines we have not found one which we consider
satisfactory.‚Äù

An entirely different interpretation of the data discussed by PunNeTT and PEaAsE
was shortly afterwards put forward by Hurcuinson (1931), who shows that the
facts are consistent with the theory that dominance is controlled by genetic factors,
and that different degrees of dominance are found in different strains. Without
postulating that either homozygote can be made by an inhibitor, or super-inhibitor,
to resemble the opposite kind of homozygote, Hurcutnson shows that in some
crosses there is apparently complete, or nearly complete, dominance of the poly-
dactylous condition ; in others, it is the four-toed condition which is completely
or nearly completely dominant ; while in a large number the heterozygotes are
divided more or less unequally, some being four- and some five-toed, owing to the
segregation of factors controlling dominance. Factors controlling dominance can,
of course, be introduced with either the four- or the five-toed parent.

If an inhibitor existed capable of reducing homozygous polydactyl (PP) birds
to the four-toed condition, its existence could be proved unequivocably by estab-
