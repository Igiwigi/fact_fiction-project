Our experiments revealed tain optimal thermogenesis. Although cytokines are proposed
that the loss of BAT function caused an upregulation of SLN as key mediators of muscle-BAT crosstalk, future studies
expression during cold adaptation in both the models. In fact, should explore these mechanisms in detail [108].

exposure to a mild cold of 16Â°C was sufficient to increase SLN
expression in oxidative muscle fibres in UCP1-KO mice. These

data suggest that the loss of UCP1 in BAT places the burden of (b) Sarcolipin-based thermogenesis in mammals

thermogenesis on muscle, which responds with an increased lacking brown adipose tissue

recruitment of SLN-based thermogenesis in the skeletal muscle. Not all eutherian mammals are endowed with BAT function.
