It is a most important part of the character of the current, and essentially
connected with its very nature, that it is always the same, The two forces are eyery-
where in it. There is neyer one current of force or one fluid only. Any one part
of the current may, as respects the presence of the two forces there, be considered
as precisely the same with any other part; and the numerous experiments which
imply their possible separation, as well as the theoretical expressions which, being
used daily, assume it, are, I think, in contradiction with facts (511, &c.). It appears
to me to be as impossi√æble to assume a current of positive or a current of negative
force alone, or of the two at once with any predominance of one oyer the other, as
it is to give an absolute charge to matter (1169. 1177.).

1628. The conviction of this truth, if, as I think, it be a truth, or on the other hand
the disproof of it, is of the greatest consequence.
