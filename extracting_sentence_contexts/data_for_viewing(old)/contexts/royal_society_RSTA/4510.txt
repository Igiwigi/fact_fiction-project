The synthesis of inorganic nanomaterials is driven by
the ever-increasing array of applications found to benefit
from the reduction in size of the primary particles.

These benefits can arise simply from the fact that nanoparticles may, through a combination of
their small size and adjustable surface chemistry, be made highly dispersible or soluble [1-4],
allowing simple solution-based processing for the formation of coatings, thin films or dense
structured ceramics. Moreover, materials confined to the nanoscale often display properties vastly
different from those of their bulk counterparts. The reduction in size may lead to changes in
structure and an increase in surface defects, as demonstrated in the case of ceria [5,6]. Small
particle sizes also lead to increased surface areas, and these two factors combine to offer enhanced
catalytic activity. When the particles are sufficiently small, many materials exhibit quantum
confinement effects, causing a change in the optoelectronic properties of the material [7-9].
Material properties can also vary with varying size and shape, enabling the development of
dye-sensitized solar cells [10] and quantum dots, which find use in biomedical imaging [11]
and display devices [12]. The enhanced physical, chemical and optoelectronic properties of
many nanomaterials have thus led to them finding use in a vast array of technological : =
