Hence the preponderance of the results by various methods is in favour of the lower
minimum. Weare confirmed in the view that the minimum is in fact at about 25° C.
by an entirely different set of experiments which were made by us by heating with a
constant power of about 250 watts regulated by a watt-balance, so that determina-
tions of current and resistance were unnecessary, This set of experiments also gave
the minimum value at about 25° C. We have not here set out the details of these
experiments, as they could not be relied on for absolute values, and would have
lengthened this communication without corresponding advantages. But for relative
values, which alone are required for determining the minimum, such measurements are
better adapted than any others for determining the comparative rise of temperature
at different points of the scale for the same heating, and they strengthen our view as
to the probability that the minimum is in fact in the neighbourhood of 25° C.

On the other hand, as regards the absolute value of the 15° calorie which we place
at 4°179, the preponderance of the results is against this low figure and in favour of
the value of 4°184, at which it is placed by Barnes. Jounn’s determination, which
works out at 4°173 at 16°°5 C., or about 4°174 at 15° C., is the only one which is
lower than our own (JouLs, ‘ Phil. Trans.,’ vol. 169, p. 365, 1878). All the electrical
determinations give higher values than ours.

For the purpose of further comparing our figures with the most recent figures
given by Barnes, we have worked out a formula for BARnas’ figures and have found
that BARNgs’ values from 0° C. to 80° C. may be represented with sufficient accuracy
by the equation
