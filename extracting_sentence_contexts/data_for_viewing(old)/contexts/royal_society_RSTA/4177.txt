Figure 7. Action changes along the unstable manifold. The solid line in panel (a) is the action difference for the two unstable : 5
manifolds as shown in figure 6, except that the manifolds are propagated t = 4 iterations. The dashed line in panel (a) is the : =
perturbation result, equation (4.1), which is too accurate to distinguish from the solid line. The variable / represents ‘length’ DR
along the manifold, and therefore is single valued. Panel (b) is a histogram of the action changes for t = 8 iterations along the ia
manifold. The solid line is a Gaussian function, whose width is given by the classical action diffusion constant, equation (2.12). : =

If this overlap integral were amenable to a saddle point analysis, then the reversibility
properties of the quantum and classical fidelity would have to be identical, because one could
follow the orbits forward and backward in time using the saddle point approximation the
entire way. In fact, the information about this issue is exactly contained in the criteria on y
just mentioned. For example, if € is fixed, in the limit of h — 0, there comes a point where the
typical or majority values of the {55;} become greater than the value of fi. The crossover occurs
just where the relation above switches to y* <d/hxsty. That is the point at which the method
of steepest descents becomes accurate again. Thus, it is also the point at which the quantum
reversibility properties again become identical to the classical, and the classical action diffusion
constant is no longer relevant. In other words, that is why it has to be the criterion for whether
the quantum reversibility properties are in the Lyapunov regime, equation (2.13), which is the
only regime where they match the classical reversibility properties. In the final analysis, it is the
structural stability of chaotic systems that enables the predictability and reversibility of quantum
and classical dynamics to differ.
