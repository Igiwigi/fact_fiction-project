The intervals of the remaining pairs have been less
accurately determined and cannot be used for such a comparison. As in the case of
the corresponding line \ 2798 of the Wide doublet (D) series, the observations of the
» 4390 doublet suggest a satellite on the more refrangible side of the chief line, and
this unusual position would accord with the greater strength of the more refrangible
components of the “ 4481” series. The “4481” series may accordingly be considered to be associated with either of the
two systems of doublets, but a more direct connection with the “ F.P.” group is
indicated by the fact that these lines occur under precisely the same experimental
conditions as 4481. With this relation no difficulty arises with regard to the small
interval of the “4481” lines, or to the limits of the series when compared with the
corresponding figures for Ca, Sr,and Ba. It may therefore be concluded that the
“ 4481” series is the Fundamental series of the “ F.P.” system. y
