Tf the Earth could be regarded as a system such as we have been considering, we
see that in addition to the ordinary Solar and Lunar Nutations, which would be of
the same nature as when the Earth is supposed solid throughout, there might exist
# certain free nutations the amplitude of which could only be determined by observa-
tion. If the amplitudes were sufficiently large, the oscillations corresponding to the
root 4 = w (1 + E) would render themselves visible in the same way as the Solar and
Lunar Nutations, namely, by small periodic displacements common to all stars. The
period of these displacements would be 1/E sidereal days, and a knowledge of it would
enable us to determine E, a quantity which depends on the form of the internal
surface and the thiokness of the crust.

The oscillations which correspond to the root \ = w/{(«, + Gq) («2 + Ge)}
would manifest themselves in a different manner. They are, in fact, similar to. the
“Kulerian” nutation (vide TisseRAND, ‘ Mécanique Céleste,’ vol. 2, p. 494), and will
involve a small periodic change in the latitude of places on the Earth’s surface, as
found by meridian observations of a circumpolar star, this change taking place in a
period of {(«, + ge) (Ky + ge.)}~? sidereal days.

Now it appears probable that in oscillations of long period, such as Precession, the
effects of fluid friction would be to make the internal fluid move with the crust
as if rigidly connected to it (T1sseRAND, ‘ Mécanique Céleste,’ vol. 2, p. 480, or
Lord Kenviy, ‘Popular Lectures and Addresses,’ vol. 2, p. 244). Hence, if @,
&, & be the principal moments of inertia for the Earth as a whole, supposed
symmetrical about its axis of rotation, the Theory of Precession will still enable us
