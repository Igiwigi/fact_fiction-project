This assertion seems strange after $0 many memoirs, of more or less value, by
different obseryers, on various species; but the wonder is much lessened by a re-
examination of their subjects. Of the thirteen monographs enumerated, two are on
Floscularia, three on Melicerta, three on Lacinularia, three on Asplanchna, and two
on Notommata. Now in Melicerta and Lacinularia the manducatory apparatus is of
the same type, and that an abnormal one; in Floscularia and Asplanchna the types of
Structure differ widely from the former, and as greatly from each other, These three
types are in fact unintelligible in themselyes, and can be explained only by tracing
the organs from their normal development, through their modifications and degene-
rations. Nothing then, in fact, has been attempted towards an explanation of the

Jaws, in the great families of Hydatinea, Euchlanidota, and Brachionea—the true
types of RoTvirtRa—except my own two memoirs on Notommata in 1850. And 1
freely confess, that, in spite of many and persevering efforts, I had not, at that time,
been able to attain any satisfaction on the true structure of these organs,
