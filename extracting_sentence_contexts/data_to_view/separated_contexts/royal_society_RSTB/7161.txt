All
six rectangles were found to become colourless at 23 m. The blue rectangles were now
moved close to the yellow ones, so as to produce three pairs, when the position for loss of
colour was found to be 8-3 m. This experiment emphasizes the fact that for loss of colour
at the maximum visual angle, the blue-yellow pairs of rectangles should be as close
together as possible.

(41) The yellow-blue grating test object

In the yellow-blue grating test object, the effect of proximity is made as great as possible
by mounting rectangles of these colours in close apposition, so that the colours alternate. In one grating prepared in this manner there were eleven yellow and ten blue rectangles,
each 100 x 6 mm. With this test object many of the experiments described in Part II were repeated, that is,
the effects of intensity of illumination, diameter of pupil, and similar factors were investi-
gated.
