HE Committee appointed'by the Royal Society to dire@ the pub-
lication of the Phrlofophical Tranſactions, take this opportunity to-
acquaint the Public, that it fully appears, as well from the council-hooks
and journals of the Society, 'as from repeated declarations, which have
been made-in ſeveral former Tranſactions, that the printing of them was
always, from' time to time, the fingle ad of the reſpeQive Secretaries, till
the Forty-ſeventh Volume : the Society, as a body, never intereſting them-
"ſelves ariy further in their publication, than by occaſionally recommending
the revival of them to ſome of their Secretaries, when, from the particular
circumſtances of their affairs, the Tran/afions had happened for any
+ length of time to be intermitted. And this ſeems principally tohave
been done with a view to ſatisfy the Public, that their uſual mcetings-
were then continued for the improvement of knowledge, and benefit of
mankind, the great ends of their firſt inſtitution by. the Royal Charters,,
and which they haye ever ſince ſteadily purſued: ,
But the Society being of Jate-years greatly inlarged, and their com-
munications more numerous, it was thought adviſcable, that a.Committece
, of. their members ſhould .be-appointed'to reconſider.the papers read be--®
fore them, and ſele&t out:of them ſuch, as they ſhould judge moſt pro-
per for publication in the future Tranſa@ions ; which was- accordingly
done upon the 26th of March 1752. And the grounds of their choice
are, and will continue to be, the importance and ſingularity of the ſub-
jets, or the advantageous manner of treating them ; without pretending .
to anſwer for the certainty of the facts, or propriety of the reaſonings,
contained in-the ſeveral papers ſo publiſhed, which muſt ſtill reſt on the-
credit or judgment of their reſpeCtive authors.

It is likewiſe neceſſary on this occaſion to remark, that it is an eſta-
bliſhed rule of the Society, to which they will always adhere, never to
give their opinion, as a body, upon any ſubjed, either of Natore or Art,
that comes before them. And therefore the thanks, which are fre-
quently propoſed from the chair, to be given to the authors of ſuch pa-
pers, as are read at their accuſtomed meetings, or to the perſons through
whoſe hands they receive them, are to be conſidered in no other light
than as a matter of civility, in return for the reſpe& ſhewn tothe Society
by thoſe communications. The like alſo is to be faid with regard to
the ſeveral projets, inventions, and curioſities of various kinds, which
are, often exhibited to'the Society ; the authors whereof, or thoſe who
exhibit them, frequently take the liberty to report, and even-to certify
in the public news-papers, that they have met with the higheſt applauſe
and approbation...
