What precedes is not to be understood as precluding the existence of a relation
between the spaces which are the loci in quibus of the coordinates (z, y) and (x, y)respect-
ively: not only may these be Spaces of the same kind, but they may be one and the same
Space or line; and the points of the two systems may then be points of the 8ame kind ;
and further, the coordinates (x,y) and (x, y) may belong to the same system of coordi-

nates, that is, the equations (v, y=a, 1) and (x, y=a, 1) may denote one and the 8ame
point.

Same line; in fact, taking arbitrarily a point out of each pair, the points 80 obtained
form a system which is homographic with the system formed with the other points of
