The description and illustrations which GARDINER gives (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 62,
p- 100) of the minute perforations which exist in the closing membranes of the pits
and walls of vegetable cells, certainly suggest that such structures are eminently
fitted for producing all the diffusive phenomena which we have found to belong to
multi-perforate septa, and it is impossible to read the descriptions without being
struck with the fact that such an arrangement is admirably adapted to bring about a
local concentration of gradient and an enhanced flow through the separating cell-
membrane, when there is the slightest difference of osmotic pressure between two
contiguous cells,

Prerrer, in his ‘ Physiology of Plants’ (Engl. edition, 1900, p. 114), when dis-
cussing the probable réle of these fine plasmatic connections, while not actually
denying that they may play an accessory part in translocation, states “ there are,
however, no observations in favour of the view that such transference is of importance
in the translocation of nutritive or excretory substances from one cell to another. Were the latter the case, the fineness of the threads would render necessary extremely
active streaming currents directed both towards the interior and the exterior of the cell ;
and to such, as well as to any passive diffusion through their substance, the relatively
trifling total sectional areas of the threads would interpose a marked hindrance.” In
another place he also remarks that the minute diameter of the connections must
necessitate the expenditure of a large amount of energy to secure transference.
