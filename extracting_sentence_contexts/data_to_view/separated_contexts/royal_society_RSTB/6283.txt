keeping these leaves in separate blocks so that the average differences between them
might be eliminated from the treatment comparisons.

2. This is supported by the fact (obtained from comparison of the mean square
variance between plants with the remainder) that the variation between plants is no
greater than within plants between leaves, so that nothing would be gained by restricting
blocks to single plants.

8. There is apparently no difference between right and left halves of leaves as
is shown by a comparison of the two mean squares for within leaves between half-leaves. FACTORS AFFECTING INFECTION BY APHIS TRANSMISSION 465

The variation between leaves is, however, significantly greater than that within
leaves so that there is a correlation between the numbers of lesions on halves of the
same leaf; but it has already been shown that this correlation is not sufficiently great
to increase the accuracy of experiments where corresponding half-leaves are used as
controls.
