numerous “biologic forms,” of which we found each morphological species to be
composed, were rigidly separated one from the other by immovable limits which
restricted each “biologic form” either to a single host-species, or to certain host-
species of one genus. At the most, a “biologic form” might, by means of a
“bridging species” (see 5, p. 285), pass from the host-species of one section of a
genus to those of another. The result of the present experiments, however, shows
us some conditions under which “ biologic forms” break down—some conditions under
which the conidia of one “ biologic form” can infect host-plants (of another “ biologie
form”), which are, as a rule, immune against its attacks. We find that when the
vitality of the leaf-cells of a host-species, susceptible, as a rule, to the attacks of only
one “ biologic form,” is affected by an injury—such as a cut or burn—the leaf-cells in
the neighbourhood of the injury are rendered susceptible to the attacks of other
“biologic forms.” It is evident, and we have clear experimental proof of the fact,
that such injured leaves will serve as “ bridges,” enabling a “ biologic form,” restricted
in its parasitism, as a rule, to one genus, to pass over to the host-species of another
genus.

We can see, now, more of the factors at work in the evolution of “ biologic forms.”
We find, on the one hand, factors, which we may call “ specialising factors,” tending
to make specialisation of parasitism more and more complete, with the result that
there originate from each morphological species a number of “ biologie forms,” each
one of which is incapable of infecting healthy leaves of any but its own host-species
