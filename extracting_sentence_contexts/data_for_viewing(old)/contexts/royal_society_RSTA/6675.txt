generally give a reasonable indication of the resultant forces to be expected on an aerofoil
surface. This paper is concerned with the extension of the linearized supersonic theory to
flow past finite aerofoils, so far as possible of arbitrary plan and cross-section. In fact,
certain limitations will be found in the applicability of the theory, which will be discussed
as they arise.

A brief discussion of previous work on supersonic flow past finite aerofoils is perhaps
necessary to explain the author’s standpoint. The first attempts were made by Schlichting
(1936) on the basis of a lifting-surface theory put forward by Prandtl. Unfortunately, an
error in the analytical treatment led to the conclusion that the problem could not be solved
analytically, and on this basis some false numerical solutions were given. The error in
Schlichting’s work was first detected by Busemann (1943) who, by the so-called ‘cone-field’
method, provided an analytical answer to the problem considered by Schlichting—that
of the rectangular plate aerofoil at incidence. In this country Lighthill (1944) in the mean-
time refined the conceptions underlying Schlichting’s work, introducing the idea of super-
