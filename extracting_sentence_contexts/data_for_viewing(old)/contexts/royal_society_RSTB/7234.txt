344. Fisher pointed out that ‘it was essential that there should be at least two in-
dependently located sampling units in each sampling area, since it was from the differences
between these, or the variance among them, if they were more than two, that the error
of sampling was estimated. The variance among the units of measurement within the
same sampling unit served a different and subsidiary purpose. It was essential to the study
of what structure or size the sampling unit should have, and by analysing the variance
within and among sampling units, one could ensure that the sampling units were so chosen
as to give the maximum precision in return for the labour expended’ (p. 615). Fisher
further pointed out that ‘the error of random sampling, on the other hand, should be
ascertained with high precision from every experiment to which the sampling method was
applied, for on it one relied for judging the number of sampling units which could with
advantage be taken from the growing crop’ (p. 615). This is exactly the point of view
adopted in the present paper. In fact the fundamental criterion used in obtaining the
optimum solution is identical with that stated by Fisher, namely, ‘maximum precision
® in return for the labour expended’, which is conveniently measured in practice in terms
of the total cost.

345. Since the publication of Neyman’s paper a number of other papers have been
published on this subject by Neyman (1938), Stephan (1939), Hansen & Harwitz (1942),
and other workers dealing, however, mainly with investigations relating to human
populations, although the theory has had applications in other fields as well. Besides a
rigorous deduction of the various formulae Neyman’s theory covers a good deal of ground
which is somewhat different from the topics discussed in the present paper and need not
therefore be considered in greater detail here.
