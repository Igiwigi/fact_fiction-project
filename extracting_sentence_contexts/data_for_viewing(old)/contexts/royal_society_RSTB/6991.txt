Dimensions: Length 0-35 mm.

Horizon: 123d—m.

Remarks: The present specimen is much flattened, and is furnished with a fine keel,
particularly along the dorsal margin. The sutures are deeply depressed, making the
chambers appear slightly inflated. The megalospheric ovoid protoconch and the lack
of any close coiling of the early chambers are characteristic features. Cristellaria
parallela Terquem (1870, 2SO, p. 430 (168), plate 9, figure 27a, 6) (non Reuss 1863,
non Schwager 1865) appears to be a closely similar form, but it is without a keel. The
depressed sutures and consequently slightly inflated chambers strongly resemble those
of the present specimen; in fact the likeness is closer in this respect than to C. similis.
Terquem’s 1886 record under the same name seems to refer to quite a different form or
forms. I have found no later record of it, and have no further specimens.

C. similis was described as rather rare from the parkinsoni zone (=Bathonian) of
Fontoy, Moselle, eastern France.
