Lax's Method of finding the Latitude of a Place,

dently of the second incremental area, which I have demon-
strated above can never be necessary, except when the zenith
distance at noon is very small. The error of three seconds arises
from a different cause, and might have been entirely excluded
with the assistance of the gd and 4th tables. We should, in
fact, deduce from these tables an approximation of 22'; and, if
we calculate the area gc with the lat. 54* g2/ o”, it will be

found equal to 34,762, and consequently —_ = 48”,62, which,

multiplied by 22, produces 17” 49,64, for the correction, and
the lat. is found = 34* 27” 49,64. It would have been still better, however, to have obtained a
near value of the lat, in the first instance, by means of the gd
and zth tables. The work might have been dispatched in
rather less time, and the conclusion would have been as rigidly
accurate.
