permanent set unless they are left in the deformed state for a very long time or are subjected
to too extensive a cycle of deformations. In order to minimize the effects of permanent set
and any anisotropy arising from it on the experimental results, the same test-piece was not
used for too many experiments.

The necessity for taking account of internal friction was avoided by restricting the
experiments to static conditions of loading.

In each of the experiments described in this paper one of two recipes was used in preparing
the vulcanized rubber test-pieces. These are referred to as A and B and are given in §20. In
principle, it would have been preferable to use a single recipe for all of the test-pieces.
In view of the general similarity in the behaviour of the rubbers prepared according to the
two recipes and the fact that even if a single recipe were used we should not be able to
count on the various test-pieces being identical in their properties, it was considered that no
purpose, except perhaps the aesthetic, would be served by repeating any extensive series of
experiments.

A. EXPERIMENTS ON PURE HOMOGENEOUS DEFORMATION
2. THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS

If the stored-energy function W for an ideal incompressible highly elastic material which
is isotropic in its undeformed state is known in terms of the invariants of strain J, and J,, then
it can be shown (Rivlin 1948 d@) that the principal components ofstress ¢; (i = 1, 2, 3) associated
with the pure homogeneous deformation of the material, for which the extension ratios are
A; (i = 1, 2,3), are given by
