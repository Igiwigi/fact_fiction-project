We can, however, say with some
confidence that at least three genotypes were represented among the five clones of the
small strain. This is very suggestive of the enormous genetic diversity existing not only within
a single species but within a given population of a species inhabiting a restricted
and continuous area. The fact, however, must not be lost sight of that, in the
absence of segregation, heterozygous genotypes retain their individuality, and
therefore a â€˜greater diversity may be expected to reveal itself here than in a self-
fertilising or closely inbred sexual population. Comparison with the Monoclonal Population. As we have seen, the monoclonal. population was descended from 70 original
ancestors, themselves all descended parthenogenetically from a single known female.
