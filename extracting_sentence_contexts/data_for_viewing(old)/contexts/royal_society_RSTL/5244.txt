* KGLLIKER, oper. cit. at p. 360, describes accurately the formation of lacunze from cartilage cells in a rickety
bone, and although he has not observed the changes with equal distinctness in normal bone, appears to have
satisfied himself that in the ossification of cartilage the cells of the latter become converted into lacunz.
M. K6Litxss does not however seem to have recognized the relation of the lacunal cells as such to the inter-
cellular tissue, neither does he mention the fact that the granular cells with their long stellated processes can
be separated from the investing cell-wall in the manner described in the text.


STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF BONE. 127

Separated the one from the other, and are no longer to be recognized as distinct
parts. If accidentally broken across, we see that they have a hollow centre, in fact,
a lacuna; but when loose and entire, they appear as rounded dense masses, project-
ing from the surface of which we may not unfrequently detect a few short needle-
like processes. Lacunal cells of the Jatter kind are not, however, very easily de-
tached, for when they have advanced thus far in development, their union with ossified
intercolumnar tissue is too strong to admit of ready separation ; indeed, after this
period their separation is impossible. It has been stated that the granular cells of
cartilage previous to the formation of lacunal cells send out processes. There are,
however, a certain number of granular cells that do not appear to undergo this change,
but preserve their state of granulation and their external figure, and show the round
nucleus even after they are surrounded by and imbedded in ossified tissue. Indeed,
we may find perfectly ossified crypts of intercolumnar tisswe at some little depth
within the forming bone, containing several of these granular cells in an unaltered
