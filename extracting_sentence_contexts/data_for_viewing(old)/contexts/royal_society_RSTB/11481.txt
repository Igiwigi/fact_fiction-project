auditory, haptic and gustatory modalities. We did not consider
interoception in that study, but it is plausible that it too may be
subject to such neglect or distortion. The net effect is that, when-
ever people consider the abstract/concrete distinction on the
basis of sensory experience, they most likely fail to consider all
relevant sensory information, and so many strongly perceptual
concepts end up erroneously categorized as abstract. If this
explanation is correct, then concepts like love (indeed, emotion
concepts in general), thought and fashionable would not be
abstract because they are strongly perceptual. Only concepts
that are weak across all perceptual modalities, such as year,
hydrogen or plausibly, would be truly abstract. However, such
an explanation is not entirely consistent with the fact that

some weakly perceptual concepts are nonetheless considered
to be highly concrete. For instance, the concepts of month,
cyanide, bacteria and brainstem are all extremely concrete (ratings
between 4 and 5 on a 1-5 concreteness scale) and yet are
simultaneously weakly experienced by all perceptual modalities
(ratings between 0 and 2 ona 0-5 perceptual strength scales). An
alternative explanation might be that the abstract/ concrete dis-
tinction does not rest on the relative extent of perceptual
grounding, but rather depends on the extent of objectivity:
abstract concepts have a subjective existence inside the mind
whereas concrete concepts have an objective existence that is
