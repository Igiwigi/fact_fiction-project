Preface

Published online 5 May 2004

There is currently a great effort amongst biologists, geneticists and mathemati-
cians to understand the mechanical properties and spatial deformations of the DNA
molecule. These deformations do in fact play an absolutely crucial role in allow-
ing DNA to perform its functions of replication and transcription. This effort has
generated a lot of deep collaborations between biologists on the one hand and math-
ematicians on the other. Writers from each camp here describe their latest research,
making a great effort to make it understandable to their counterparts in the other
area. All contributors are leading international researchers.

Viewed globally, DNA is a very long flexible rod which can be modelled, to a first
approximation, as a uniform elastic continuum. The mathematical theory of Kirch-
hoff rods then allows a study of the twisting and writhing of the molecule. Locally,
however, the mechanical properties are highly dependent on the coding sequence, and
this must be analysed to understand the more-detailed interactions of the molecule.
Important issues are the bending of DNA by proteins, and the structural phase
