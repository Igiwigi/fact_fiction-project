Now, if the disturbance could be analysed: as a number of simple circular functions
with distinct periods, the separate elements would have meaning, as in the familiar
harmonic analyses of tides, vibrations of musical instruments, &c. The question we
have to answer is, have the simple elements meaning in the limit, when their number
is infinite, and the sum becomes an integral ?

§ 7. We will at once notice an obvious criticism; this was, in fact, offered by
Porncarh,t soon after Gouy’s article appeared. Each of the component vibrations
du(C cos ut + § sin ut) exists unchanged through all time. This is true whatever
be the nature of the disturbance we are analysing.
