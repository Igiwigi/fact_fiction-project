In the last, it is
situated at the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the fissure, in the Orang
and in Man it is found at about the mid-point between the upper margin of the
hemisphere and the Fissure of Synvius, or higher. We would suggest that this
is due to the greater development in the higher animals of the convolutions about
the lower end of the Fissure of RoLanpo, including the third frontal gyrus. We
think this is borne out by the fact that it is the lower part of the Fissure of RoLanvo,
a.e., that part below the genu, which is so much lengthened. Of further curvation, the Fissure of RoLanpo often exhibits at its upper end
a slight bend forwards which, in man, is surmounted by a small curve in the opposite
direction. The Precentral Sulcus

Consists of a vertical arm, which springs from close above the Fissure of Sytvrus,
and ascends till it bifurcates just below the horizontal level of the genu of the
Fissure of RoLanpo, into a posterior ascending branch and an anterior horizontal.
