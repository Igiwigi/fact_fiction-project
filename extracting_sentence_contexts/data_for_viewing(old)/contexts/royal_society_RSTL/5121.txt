revolved, directly, it produced a current (3091.) ; and when the internal radius wire
alone (being insulated from the magnet) reyolyed, directly, it also produced a current
(3095. 3098.) in the contrary direction to the former; and the two were exactly
equal in power; for when both portions of the wire moved together directly, they
perfectly compensated each other (3095.). This radius wire may be replaced by the
magnet itself (3096. 3118.).


ON THE LINES OF MAGNETIC FORCE WITHIN A MAGNET, 39

3117. So, by this test there exist lines of force within the magnet, of the same
nature as those without. What is more, they are exactly equal in amount to those
without. They have a relation in direction to those without ; and in fact are conti-
nuations of them, absolutely unchanged in their nature, 80 far as the experimental
test can Ã¾e applied to them. Every line of force therefore, at whateyer distance it
may be taken from the magnet, must be considered as a closed circuit, passing in
some part of its course through the magnet, and having an equal amount of force in
every part of its course.

3118. When the axial part of the wire is dismissed and the magnet employed in
its place, s0 as to be included in the circuit, it is easy to See how it acts the part of
the conductor. For suppose the wire itself to be continued Fig. 12.
from N to b, fig. 12, by any of the three paths indicated by
dotted lines, the effect is the same in all the cases, both by
experiment (3093.) and by principle (3100.). For whatever
