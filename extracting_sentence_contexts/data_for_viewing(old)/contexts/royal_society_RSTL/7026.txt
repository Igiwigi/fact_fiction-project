E corpus callosum measure respectively 1:3, 1:25, and 1:9 inch; whereas in the European
EZ they measure 1-4, 1:6, and 22 inches.
Z Imaginary lines drawn from the centre of the medulla oblongata, where it intersects
= the pons, to the extreme occipital, frontal, parietal, and vertical points of the cerebrum,
Y lines which I have elsewhere designated cerebral radii*, measure, in the Bushwoman,
Z respectively 34, 40, 35, and 41 tenths of an inch; whilst in a European female they
S measure 33, 43, 39, and 46 tenths. Accordingly the occipital radius, owing evidently
to the length of the temporal lobe backwards, is slightly in excess, the frontal radius is
a little defective, the parietal a little more 80, whilst the vertical radius is the most 80,
as compared with the European brain.

'The final result of these measurements, as well as of others given in Table I. at the
end of this paper, and of the facts elicited by the examination of the several aspects
of the brain, is to show that in this Bushwoman the cerebrum is s8mall but long,
defective in width, and especially s0 in height; that its outlines and surfaces are angular
and flat, instead of rounded and full as in the European ; that, of its several regions,
the frontal, though long, is very narrow and shallow, much excavated below, and com-
pressed laterally in a remarkable manner behind its angles, in front of the Sylvian
