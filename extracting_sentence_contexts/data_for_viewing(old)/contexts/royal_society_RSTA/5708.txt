do =H ® f(x) ® D(z). (1.2)

In practice, QCD factorization formulas like equations (1.1) and (1.2) do not involve simple
products, but rather convolution integrals over shared momentum fractions, and this is
represented by the ‘®’ symbol.

As might be expected, such simplistic pictures as these come with many caveats, and they
are only approximate when they hold at all. But they provide a useful starting point for more
detailed studies and are ubiquitous in investigations of partonic structure by way of scattering
experiments.

The practical usefulness of factorization formulas like these lies in the fact that QCD is
asymptotically free over short time and distance scales, so that it is possible to calculate H
(which describes the actual collision with the quark) using ordinary small coupling perturbation
theory techniques. The other pieces of the formula, f(x) and D(z), are to be viewed as intrinsic to
the incoming proton and hadronizing parton, respectively. These non-perturbative functions are
independent of the particular physical process and can be constrained by experimental data.

The semi-classical nature of the factorization formulas above suggests that their derivations in
real QCD are ultimately arguments about decoherence between processes happening over widely
separate time and distance scales. Departures from the simplest factorized pictures typically
involve some form of failure of decoherence. Since the original fully inclusive DIS process in
