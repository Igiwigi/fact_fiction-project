wide field of view also makes LOFAR an attractive survey instrument, and itis the only instrument
currently capable of sub-arcsecond resolution at megahertz frequencies, where the Dark Ages
signal can be reached. This provides access to higher values of k_.

Figure 1 shows what values of k, and kj are currently available to LOFAR. Horizontal
shaded regions indicate the redshift ranges which LOFAR cannot access because of its frequency
coverage. This is based on the default observational set-up and current array configuration.
This includes 13 international stations, which provide k, ~ 107°-107 Mpe7! for the HBA and
k, ~10!5-10?3 Mpc“! for the LBA. The default frequency set-up is 30-78 MHz for the LBA and
120-168 MHz for the HBA. The LOFAR EoR project [26,27] uses a slightly different frequency
range to access higher redshifts, but has to deal with the increasing radio-frequency interference
(RFI) at the top of the HBA band (the RFI rapidly increases above approx. 168 MHz). The LBA is
clearly more interesting for studying the Dark Ages, and in fact Gehlot et al. [28] have placed the
first limits on the power spectrum for z = 19.8-25.2. They use only the Dutch array, which limits
ky to <0.16Mpce~!, and places a 20 limit of A3, < (approx. 1500 mK)? at k= 0.038 Mpc™! from
two simultaneously observed fields. They centre their bandwidth on the most sensitive portion
of the LBA band, setting frequency limits of 39-72 MHz. Increasing the redshift upper limit to
z> 100 is technically possible by shifting the usable bandwidth down to start at the hard limit
of 10 MHz, but this comes at the cost of greatly reduced sensitivity. It is worth noting that finer
frequency increments provide diminishing returns in reaching higher values of ky. The limits are
ky ~ 10-21-1027 Mpc™! for the HBA and ky ~ 10-24-1024 Mpc7! for the LBA. These calculations
assume that there are no foregrounds to remove, which is addressed in the next section.
