work was projected can be gathered from the fact that at Tirox’s death writ

than 350 clinical cases bearing on the question came into the hands of the late P
fessor Ducuek. TUrRck experimented only on the Dog. He divided the spi
nerves outside the vertebral column and, conversely to Preyer, EckHARD, 4
KoscHEWNIKOFF, severed only the spinal nerve which he desired to examine.

extant in the posthumous paper is twenty-five. Of this number twenty were up
the brachial plexus; the remaining five upon the lumbo-sacral, The difficulty of unde
standing the experimental notes and the drawings left by TURcx is partly due to th
brevity and to the variation found in different individuals. Partly it is due to
terminology which he considered it advantageous to employ. I will quote his indu

does not appear to have examined the trunk apart from the region abutting on the limb

The area of distribution of each nerve-root in the neck and trunk is shaped like
band which runs round from the vertebral column to the ventral middle line in a di
tion at right angles to the long axis of the body. The areas of distribution of
spinal nerves supplying the skin of the extremities follow, with some modificatic
the same plan as the other spinal nerves. Their agreement with the others is, hoy
ever, only apparent when the limbs are brought into a certain position with relati
to the trunk. For the anterior extremity this position is when the limb is at righ
angles to the trunk, fully extended at all its joints and with the hand somew
supine. The areas of distribution of the limbs behave as if they originally ran rout
the sides, as in the neck and trunk, and had been displaced by the sideward extensi¢
