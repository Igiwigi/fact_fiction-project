Ram [40] says,

Courts, agencies, and legislatures have accepted that individuals have significant and
cognizable interests in their identifiable genetic information. Many individuals appear
similarly interested in protecting their identifiable genetic information from prying eyes. But the rules that these institutions embrace are largely under inclusive because they fail
to take seriously the inconvenient fact that identifiable genetic information is involuntarily
and immutably shared with close genetic relatives. In the future, there will likely be a number of similar challenges as novel digital assets and
digital personas of connected people may exhibit connected properties, either in their digital
behaviour, activities, opinions or in their attributes, beyond any hard data. Suppose that some
institution collects information on the behaviour of some digital asset (an account or an avatar,
online, say), from a largish population sample, together with the corresponding hard identity
and some hard attribute information of the individual (culture, race, beliefs, region, age, gender,
socio-economic group, etc.).
