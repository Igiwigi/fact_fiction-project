TI always found (with one or two doubtful exceptions) that this is a pigment
confined to the tentacles, and, as already stated, it cannot be changed into anything
capable of being oxidised and reduced ; but whether it is intended for a protective
purpose or as a means of attracting prey, further research may decide. Another kind of pigment is that found in the * eye-spot‚Äù of Actinia mesembryan-
themum (spectrum 9, Chart I.). Tt is a noteworthy fact that in the eye of Mus
domestica + a red colouring matter occurs which gives a band covering D. Tb is also
found in other insects' eyes. Poxssibly, the band in Actinia mesembryanthemum denotes
that the pigment is capable of absorbing certain rays of light, 80 as to enable the animal
to distinguish light from darkness. 'The presence of other light-absorbing pigments,
and their possible use in 80me obscure photo-chemical processes in the bodies of
Aetinize, ought not to be overlooked.
