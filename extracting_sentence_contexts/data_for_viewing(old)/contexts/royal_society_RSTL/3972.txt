*All the other SysToLIDes, having jaws enclosed in a muscular pharyngeal bulb,
which is moveable and protractile, at the bottom of a ciliated vestibule, may be
distinguished according to the form of these jaws. Thus the Rotifers have their
Jaws in the form of a stirrup, opposed by the base, and bearing two or more small
teeth, laid parallel, like arrows on a bow. The outer border, which is semicircular,
furnishes a point of attachment for the muscles of the pharyngeal bulb ; and, drawn
by them, it is strongly elevated and depressed, to produce, during manducation, the
movement of the jaws. Their inner border is composed of two transverse bars, a
little arched outwardly... . . All the others . . . have jaws more resembling those of
articulated animals, and composed of an assemblage of articulated pieces, which we
may, up to a certain point, compare to the two pairs of mandibles and jaws, to the
lips, to the tongue, and to the labial palpi of insects. In fact, in many of the SysTo-
LIDES we observe a central odd piece, on which are articulated two simple branches,
which bear upon each other, or meet as by a hinge, in the midst of moveable and
articulated pieces, supporting the jaws properly 0 called, and transmitting to them,
thus, all the effort of the median muscular mass, to make them bite upon the prey, by
furnishing to them a point d'appui, when the lateral muscles draw back the external
branches which carry the jaws *.‚Äù

15. The eminent French naturalist, in this description of the Jaws, which appears
to be drawn from the type found in such genera as Diglena and Albertia, has touched
a key which might have unlocked the structure, not in a few genera only, but in the
whole class of Roviysra. As it is, however, I cannot agree with Dr. OsKar Scamipr,
that the arrangement and function of the teeth, and of the Surrounding bulb, are 80
