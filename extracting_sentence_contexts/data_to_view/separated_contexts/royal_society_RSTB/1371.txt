It is only quite recently, however, that we have acquired any
exact knowledge of their structure. As mentioned in our former paper,§ Renavuut
has now found decisive proof that certain fossils formerly described under the name
of Astromyelon|| are identical with the roots of Calamites, thus confirming the
conclusion at which he had already arrived in the year 1885.1

Relation of Root and Stem. The evidence for the fact that roots with the structure of Astromyelon were borne
on Calamitean stems, depends at present on the discoveries of Renauit, who in
his latest work repeatedly figures such roots in direct connection with the stem of
his Arthropitys (our Calamites) as well as of Calamodendron and Bornia,**
