greater than those in the LAD branch both before and after stenting. From a physical point of
view, the shear stresses inherit the flow hydrodynamics, as they are proportional to the fluid
velocity gradient. Therefore, figures 12 and 13 inherit the velocity distribution shown in figures
10 and 11.

Figure 14 shows the contribution of myocardial revascularization (stenting) to the change in
the mean wall shear stress at the artery bifurcation site. The obtained result indicates that the
performed procedure of stenting of both branches of the left coronary artery leads to a significant
(several times) decrease in shear stresses in the bifurcation area. The obtained result is consistent
with the instantaneous distributions of shear stresses at different characteristic moments of the
cardiac cycle (figures 12 and 13). We can see that the shear stress decreases most strongly in the
area before stenosis in the LAD branch. This occurs apparently due to the fact that the DA branch
flow near the bifurcation region before and after stenting is the most intense. As a consequence,
larger shear stresses arise on the surface of its walls.

The most intense blood flow in the DA branch before stenting is probably due to the anatomical
localization of the stenosis in the affected area and its angle of origin. As this takes place, after
stenting, it would be logical to observe a uniform increase in the linear velocities of blood flow in
both the LAD and DA branches. Nevertheless, according to the analysis, the blood flow again
