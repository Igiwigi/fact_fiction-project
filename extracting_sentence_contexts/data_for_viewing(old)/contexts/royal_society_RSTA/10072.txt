increases ; but at the same time the [H curve becomes more and more clearly that of
a mixture of magnetically hard and magnetically soft materials.

§7. In the alloy containing 26-7 per cent. Ni the relative amount of the magnetically
hard material, at —186° C., has so far increased that the initial fall of permeability
during heating has’ practically disappeared.

The decrease of permeability of the soft material during rise of temperature is
almost exactly counterbalanced by the corresponding increase of that of the hard
material, 3

Thus over a considerable range of temperature we have a material of practically
constant magnetic properties. We have, in fact, a magnetic analogue of the alloy of
practically negligible thermal coefficient discovered by GUILLAUME.

The 26°7 per cent. Ni alloy isa magnetic invar. Its BH curves are nearly identical
for values of H between 25 and 400 over a temperature range of more than 300° C.
(from —186° C. to at least +120° C.).

§ 8. In the 24-4 and 24:04 per cent. Ni alloys the permeability increases as the
temperature rises from —186° C., even in the strongest fields. A study of the data
shows that the effect of a magnetically hard material now preponderates. The
presence of the nickel-poor material is shown clearly, in the curves for the 24 per cent.
alloy, by the marked increase of permeability (for H = 50) beyond 200° C., “e., after
the opposing influence of the nickel-rich material has disappeared.
