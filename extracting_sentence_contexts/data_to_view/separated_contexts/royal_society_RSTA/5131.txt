For the case worked out by FREsNEL, that of isotropic media, the
constitution of his medium is thus limited to be precisely that of the labile sether
of Lord Kevin ; in order to satisfy also the fifth condition, that of continuity of
energy, we are constrained to take the displacement perpendicular to the plane of
polarization, which gives a reason independent of experiment for Fresnutâ€™s choice. 24, Let us next consider the second form of hypothesis, that of incompressibility,
At the interface all three components of the displacement must now be continuous;
and to obtain a solution, there is needed only one other condition, which may be taken
to be the preservation of the energy of the motion. Here, as NEUMANN remarks, there
is absolutely nothing assumed about the elastic condition of the media, which may
fact remain wholly unknown except as to their assumed incompressibility and as to the
law of density, and the problem of reflexion will nevertheless be completely solve But if we go further than this, and attempt to speculate about the elasticity of th
optical medium, it must be limited to be of such nature as also to satisfy two other cor
ditions which are involved in the continuity of the tangential stress at the interface. Thus on the principles that the energy is propagated along the rays, that it is a



'

any instant half potential and half kinetic, and that there is no loss of energy of the
light in the act of reflexion, and on the hypothesis that the medium is incompressible,
the solution of the problem of reflexion as distinct from that of the elastic constitution
of the medium is immediately derived, for all media which polarize the light linearly,
without the aid of further knowledge except the law of density and the form of the
wave-surface.
