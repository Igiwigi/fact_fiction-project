to eggs that died under hens. A, has the same meaning as in Curves IV.; A, is for


442 DR. A. P. CHATTOCK ON THE PHYSICS OF INCUBATION,

9 of the 10 eggs marked * dead in shell” in Table II. ; and A, is for 41 eggs which were
either infertile or died at the beginning of incubation under hens. A, has been raised
in the diagram by 0-06 for easier comparison with Aj.

It will be seen that, A, behaves much as B, and ©, in Curves [V., so far as the rapid
rise in the first few days is concerned. The peak shown about the tenth day, and which
appears in A, and slightly in A, itself, is not found in Curves LV. That it corresponds
to something happening in the eggs seems to follow from the fact that the sitting boxes
from which the eggs for A,, As, A, were taken were, in the main, different; and, in the
case of Ay, that the peak was reproduced in an incubator.

This incubator, a 60-egg Hearson, was set with 50 eggs, which were weighed separately
each day. Among the eggs were several infertiles, and these, with others that died
at the start, furnished 15 eggs of the A; type. Thirty-one eggs hatched out.
