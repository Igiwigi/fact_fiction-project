more clear. And, recognizing that the obscurity of a passage is often due to imperfect
punctuation, he at times felt it his duty to offer advice to an author even with regard
to his commas and semicolons. The papers which the Society published during Stokes’
secretaryship are doubtless not in all cases models of lucid and elegant English; but where
there is failure in this respect the fault cannot be laid at Stokes’ door; he, during long years,
did his best to make it otherwise.

So wrote Michael Foster, Cambridge physiologist and secretary of the Royal Society alongside
Stokes, in the Memoir and Scientific Correspondence of 1907 [2]. Herein, we present the second part
of the contributions to this bicentenary celebration of Stokes’ achievements. As we have already
seen in Part 1, and we find once again here, these range over huge areas of physics and beyond.

In fact, it was aspects of Stokes’ character beyond his scientific contributions that first caught
the attention of poets. Stokes was deeply interested in attempting to reconcile science and religion,
and nineteenth- and early twentieth-century poets singled out his religiosity for praise—Jebb and
Mason were both Cambridge classicists (boxes 1 and 2). A more recent poem by Michael Berry
highlights his contributions to the theory of asymptotics (box 3). A couple of us have tried our
hand at following this Stokesian poetic tradition and we celebrate his work in fluid mechanics
(box 4), and sum up his entire biography in verse (box 5).

The Stokes?” Symposium took place at Pembroke College, Stokes’ college, from 16 to 18
September 2019; we show representative scenes of those 3 days in Cambridge in figures 1-3.
What is the function of celebrating his anniversary with a symposium and with these papers? In
our introduction to part 1, we argued—as T. S. Eliot [4] and Michael Polyani [5], among others,
have done before us for literature and science, respectively—that being steeped in the tradition is
