@;, 7, 7, be the components of w along fixed axes, and w,, w,, w, be its components along

and we have just seen how that proposition follows at once Fan the fundamental
theorem in section 35, and from the self-evident fact that D,(Q, Q)=0.

41. Recapitulating then the results of the two last sections, we see that a particle's
system-acceleration is equivalent to det (D(Q), R) minus the centrifugal force, and that,
the absolute acceleration of the particle is compounded of the relative acceleration of
the particle, its system-acceleration, and 2 det (Q, V,), V, being the particle's relative
velocity. Tf we now look back on the analytical expressions obtained in section 38 for the com-
ponents fe 56 absolute acceleration, it will be easy to see their full meaning.
