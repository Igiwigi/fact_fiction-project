should be made clear at the outset that the aim in doing so
is not to label human evolution one way or the other.
Major transitions, of whatever sort, are not biological pro-
cesses, but descriptive or analytical categories. One person’s
major transition is another person’s new adaptation. Rather,
the purpose is to use the concept of evolutionary transitions
to explore the tempo and mode of the changes that led to
humans as a uniquely unique species.

In the first part, I will discuss different levels of evolution-
ary change, and introduce a four-part classification. The
distinction between normal and transitional evolution is an
oversimplification, and there are in fact a scaled series of
types of change in evolution that will be described. In the
second, I consider the evidence for these in human evolution,
and when they may have occurred. Finally, I will look at the
overall evidence in terms of the tempo and mode of human
evolution, and the nature of its causes. The main theme is
that evolutionary change occurs persistently throughout the
five or more million years of our lineage, but that it is more
significant in some periods than others, with cascades
of change that may be inter-related. In moving from the
specifics of human evolution to the general processes of evol-
ution, I will argue that the advantage of human evolution as
a model for evolutionary change is that we have a detailed
