In the one case, the motion is uniform; in the other,
it is accelerated. In a current, the body may be carried forward
in all directions; and even in curved lines; but, when it falls in
a quiescent fluid, by the action of gravity, or rises, in conse-
quence of its being specifically lighter than the fluid, it must
necessarily move-in a vertical direction. The fact is, that I very often -observed, in the course of my
numerous experiments, the motions of small particles of matter,
of different kinds, in water, which Dr.. THomson describes;
but, 80 far from inferring from them the existence of currents in
that fluid, their-cause was $0 per≈øectly evident, that I did not
even think it necessary to make any mention of them.

I cannot conclude this Paper, without requesting that the
Royal Society would excuse the liberty I have taken in troubling
them with these remarks. Very desirous of avoiding every spe-
cies. of altercation, I have hitherto cautiously abstained from
engaging in literary disputes ; and I shall most certainly endea-
vour to avoid them in future. ;

I am responsible to the public for the accuracy of the accounts
which I have published of my experiments; but it cannot rea-
sonably be expected, that I should answer all the objections that
may be made to the conclusions which I have drawn from them.
