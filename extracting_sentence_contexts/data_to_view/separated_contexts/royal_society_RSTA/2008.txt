A notable characteristic of the governing equations
based on VO operators is the resulting evolutionary nature. In other terms, VO operators
offer the possibility to update their order as a function of either dependent or independent
variables, resulting in governing equations that can evolve in real time from linear to nonlinear
without requiring modifications to the fundamental governing equations. Probably even more
remarkable, and certainly in stark contrast with a more traditional approach to the analysis of
nonlinear dynamical systems, is the fact that VO governing equations do not require a priori
assumptions on the physical location of elements undergoing the nonlinear behaviour. In other
terms, the nonlinear behaviour naturally emerges, propagates, and annihilates based on the
instantaneous response of the system and of the individual particles. In conclusion, the results
presented in this study illustrated some unique features of VO-FC for the modelling of nonlinear
dynamical systems with evolving discontinuities and suggested that this mathematical tool could
play a critical role in the development of advanced simulation techniques for complex nonlinear
dynamical systems.
