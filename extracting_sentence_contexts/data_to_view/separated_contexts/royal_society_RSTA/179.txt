For flexure in the yield range F(x) cannot be expressed in a manner
suitable for differentiation, so that it is necessary to integrate equation (15-3), giving

F(x) S94 2% = Pf (2) (15-4)
where ke) = eae dd. By considering the end conditions it will be seen that the arbitrary constant of integration
a assumes the value 0 for the case of a central concentrated load, and 1 for the case of
acantilever. The utility of equation (15-4) lies in the fact that C/A, is usually small. With the
numerical values adopted for the case of pure bending, C/A, = 0-023. The term /, (x) is
therefore small, and can be estimated with sufficient accuracy from a rough guess of the
mode of Â¢.

(b) Solution by finite difference approximations

The eigen-value y in equation (15-4) may readily be determined by using finite difference
approximations to the first and second derivatives of 6.
