S therefore (as in Nais and Tambricus) two of these organs in each ring of the body.
I This fact is of morphological value, for the testes bear no relation either in number or
SE position to the annuli of the body. The organs stand vertically i situ, the ends («, @)
2 S being attached to the abdominal surface, and the fundus (b) floating guts near the
# roof of the containing chamber.
EZ 1n order to the further examination of these delicate organs they must now be cut
S out, as closely to the abdominal surface as possible, by means of small curved scissors.
S They should then be floated in water on a glass slide, covered by a thin slip and placed
Z under the microscope. If the organs have been successfully dissected out, it will be seen
= that one limb (@) is broader and more transparent than the other (9 @). In the former
© mb (a?) the ova (&) are merely pellucid cells, consisting exclusiy ely of the germinal
vesicle and germinal spot. Tn the latter limb (9 @) the ova (5) have acquired their full
complement of vitellus. At this stage they exhibit a flattened ovoid form. 'This fact
affords a demonstration as to the course taken by the ova in their passage from the ovary
(f @) properly 80 called, towards the exterior. The seat of the true ovary is marked
by the plexus of vessels (F). By the ovary is meant that part of the apparatus in
which the ova are formed, that part which is endowed with the peculiar power of ovoge-

nesis. Tn relation to this special centre, all the rest of the organ may be characterized
density of the integuments, it was impossible to obtain such a view of the internal parts as would justify
any conclusions on the 8ubject. These organs in CTepsina are 8tated by LEYDIG to be ciliated. No cilia
ean be discovered in any part of their structure, either in the Common Leech or in the Sea-leech.
