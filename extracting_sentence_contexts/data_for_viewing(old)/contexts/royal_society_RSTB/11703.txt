Some say that a conscious reflection of probabilistic represen-
tation can be found in conscious confidence. One can have a
conscious sense of a low degree of confidence that that is Isaac
in the distance. As one gets closer, oneâ€™s conscious confidence
that it is Isaac might increase [21]. However, such confidences
involve cognitive categorization of perception (where cognition
is the domain of thought and reasoning). One can be very con-
fident that one sees something, less confident that one sees a
person, still less confident that one sees a guy in a ill-fitting
suit and still less confident that one sees Isaac [6]. The fact that
conscious confidence depends on the imposition of cogni-
tive categories raises the question of the extent to which the
phenomenology of confidence is perceptual phenomenology.

Morrison has countered by appealing to perceptual categor-
ization, saying it is the perceptual categories that make the
confidences perceptual [22]. However, it is not the case that
perceptual categorization is involved in all perception. The
operational index of perceptual categorization is faster and
more accurate discrimination across perceptual categories
than within perceptual categories. And that obtains in only
some cases of perception, for example, colour perception and
