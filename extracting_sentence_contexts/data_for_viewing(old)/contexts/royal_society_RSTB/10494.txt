is that interference is a mechanism to avoid COs occurring in
close proximity, which might reduce cohesion between homol-
ogues [158] or slip and cancel each other out when they involve
two or four non-interlocking chromatids, resulting in no CO
occurring [159]; however, these mechanisms do not explain
long-distance interference. A further suggestion is that CO
interference may be adaptive by breaking up genetic associ-
ations. First, adjacent COs may be avoided because they cancel
their effects on genetic associations [160]. Second, it has been
speculated that CO interference may reduce the chances of
breaking up co-adapted gene complexes (supergenes) [157].
Some support for the idea that CO interference is not a purely
mechanistic constraint comes from the fact that some species
lack interference [154] and, more importantly, that there is
some evidence suggesting that interference levels evolve in
long-term evolution experiments in Drosophila [161].

(c) Differences in recombination rates between the

Sexes
In many species, CO rates and localization differ between male
and female meioses, and these differences can vary in degree
and direction even between closely related species [162-164].
The most extreme case is achiasmy, an absence of recombin-
ation in one sex, nearly always the heterogametic sex [162].
