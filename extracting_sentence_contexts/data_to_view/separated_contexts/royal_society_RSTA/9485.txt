These new disclosures mean that twice during each complete rotation of the
“head ” of such a “‘ spinning” detonation, there recurs abruptly either an ignition
of a pocket of gas or a sudden increase in combustion intensity—for reasons given
below, more probably the former—in or immediately behind the wave-front. Whichever it is, it constitutes a characteristic feature of the phenomenon. Another point to be borne in mind is the extremely high temperature and radiating
power of the “ head ”’ of detonation, as proved by the fact that on traversing a glass
tube upon the inner wall of which a mirror of silver had previously been deposited,
it cut a spiral track by volatilizing the deposited silver during its passage. Theoretical—(A) The new explanation of detonation to which the cumulative
evidence of our researches has led may now be amplified with the aid of fig. 8,
which has been constructed from photograph, fig. 5. It represents diagrammatically
the state of things at each of twelve successive instants, 1/100,000 second apart,
in the explosion of a moist 2CO + O, medium starting from a point in the pre-
detonation stage 1/50,000 second before the auto-ignition occurs.
