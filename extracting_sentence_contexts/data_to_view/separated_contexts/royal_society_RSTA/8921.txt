The two former authors confined themselves to the solar diurnal
magnetic variations, but VAN BEMMELEN broke fresh ground by applying harmonic
analysis also to the lunar diurnal variations. The importance of the latter was
fully recognized by both Batrour Srewarr and Scuusrer, who, in his second
memoir (p. 181), urged the desirability of further study of them. Some of the above, and other, writers reached conclusions adverse to the SrEwART-
Scuuster theory, partly owing to the fact that the results of their analyses of
the observational data differed from Scuusrerâ€™s. The present paper embodies an
attempt to resolve the points in dispute, and to remove other obscurities in the
theory. New analyses are made both of the solar and lunar diurnal magnetic
variations, so that the chief facts relating to each may be discussed together.
