XXI. On the Double Metamorphosis in the Decapodous Crustacea, exemplified in

IN the Memoir published in my Zoological Researches, p. 1, with its sequel, p. 63,
having first made known the fact of the Brachyura of the Decapoda (Crabs) passing
through the intermediate form of Zoea; I have now to announce that they undergo
another metamorphose, no less singular and unlooked for, in which they assume the
form of the genus designated by the name of Megalopa by Dr. Leacn, from the dis-
proportionate size of the eyes. This second stage we may therefore consider analo-
gous to that of pupa in the class Insecta.

By the former memoir it appears that the young of Cancer Pagurus, the common
market Crab, first presents itself as a Zoe *, and that a full-grown Zoe was observed
passing into some other more perfect form , which at that time was considered to
be that of some species of Crab : the discovery now first detailed, however, shows
that it must have been only passing into that of a Megalope.
