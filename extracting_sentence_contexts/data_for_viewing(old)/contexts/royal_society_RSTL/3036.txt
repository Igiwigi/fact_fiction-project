after him. It does not however appear that the eminent
historian just mentioned had ever been present at the em-
balming of a mummy, or that he ever had an opportunity
of examining one of them. He 'must, therefore, like many
other travellers, have noted down what he had -collected
from hearsay, in which, amidst much that was surmised,
there was something approaching to the truth. It is in
evidence that/the art was kept a profound mystery among
those who (professed 'it, 80 that the different modes of em-

by Heroportvs, could only have been conjectural. It is a
curious fact, that, with the exception of the lateral incision,
and immersion into a saline solution mentioned by that histo-
rian, we find no confirmatory evidence of the other steps of
the supposed processes of embalming detailed by him in any
of the various mummies that have hitherto been examined.
