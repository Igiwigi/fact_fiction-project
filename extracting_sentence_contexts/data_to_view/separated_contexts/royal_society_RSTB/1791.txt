The real test of a coccolith is thus its
double structure. Judged by this standard, by far the larger number of bodies
described by geologists as coccoliths, have no claim to be so considered. There is, in
fact, no evidence that they are derived from even allied organisms. In order to place this matter beyond doubt by an examination of authentic
geological coccoliths, we were supplied by Professor Jupp and Mr, Caapman with
material for comparison with that obtained from the surface organisms and the deep
sea deposits. Houxtey has figured a true coccolith with double structure from the Sussex chalk
