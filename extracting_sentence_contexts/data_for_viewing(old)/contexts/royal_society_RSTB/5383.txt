(1900) refers to it in Acanthias as follows :—

“Am Uebergange der Arterie basilaris in den Tractus spinalis ventralis findet sich
bei allen injicirten Gehirnen eine schmale Insel eingeschaltet, deren beide
Schenkel nahezu parallel nebeneinander liegen. Sie soll als Circulus arteriosus
spinalis primus bezeichnet werden.” i

The longitudinal anterior spinal artery is formed at the level of the uppermost rootlet
of the first cervical nerve. Only a short segment of the vessel is seen in the specimens
before the level is reached at which the brain was sectioned. The branches of the
anterior spinal artery are small vessels which are distributed within the area bounded
by the median and antero-laterial sulci. In man, Stoprorp has found that these
branches are distributed to the medial region of the cord and bulb; in fact, in man
he has found that the trigonum hypoglossi is invariably delineated in injected
specimens (1916). This I have confirmed (1927).

In the left side of the specimen depicted in fig. 1 there is, however, a branch which
arises from the left stem of origin and which proceeds laterally to inosculate with the

posterior spinal artery. This branch is not present in the other specimens, and in a
large series of other mammalian brains I have not encountered it. Its presence is
therefore emphasised, since it has an important bearing on the hypothesis put forward
