ยง 32. When comparing the Kew data with those from the Bureau Central and the
Eiffel Tower, we found that the 12-hour term in the diurnal inequality of potential
was the only one which presented under all conditions closely similar features as
regards times of maxima and minima, and as regards amplitude near the ground.
Similarly, it is well known that the 12-hour term in the diurnal inequality of
barometric pressure presents at the ground level phenomena of a much more regular
character than does the 24-hour term. The latter term seems largely dependent on
local conditions, whereas the 12-hour term is usually pretty much the same at places
of nearly the same latitude. These phenomena are shown in a striking fashion by
comparing the data of Table XVIII. with corresponding data for Jersey* based on
observations by DECHEVRENS.

In view of these facts, it is highly significant that the general resemblance that
has been noticed between the diurnal inequalities of potential gradient and barometric
pressure is now found to proceed almost entirely from the parts that have a 12-hour
period. At Kew, at least, so far as the 24-hour terms are concerned, it isa case not
of resemblance, but of marked dissimilarity.

During the seven years whose data have been considered, the charge of the
electrograph and the taking of the absolute observations have devolved upon
Mr. E, G, Consrasxe, the Senior Assistant engaged in the meteorological work of
the Observatory Department, and his Junior Assistant, Mr. E. Boxatn. The
selected days were chosen by Mr. ConsraBxe in consultation with myself.

The chief burden of the preliminary work was borne by Mr. ConsraBie, who drew
