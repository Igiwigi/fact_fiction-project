that the time requisite for the molecules to move the length of the tube was decide
less than that occupied by the discharge, but was sufficiently comparable with it to
the diminution of intensity of the streams from the side of the tube to make it
visible before the streams from the negative terminal experienced a similar dimin ti

Thus far we have only been dealing with positive relief But the phenomens

In that case we know that the impulses that cause discharge arrive at the negaW
terminal of the tube and at the tinfoil synchronously, for the difference (if any) in
time required to pass from the machine along the wires to the two Places is ineo
parably smaller than any of the quantities with which we have to deal.* And yet

accompanying molecular streams are still in full vigour when the molecular streams
