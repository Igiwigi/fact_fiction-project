I have seen bile in the
marginal zone of cells when all the rest of the lobules was in a state of complete
degeneration ; I have observed in the liver of an animal, to whom calomel had been
given, bile, though present elsewhere, yet most abundant on the margins of the
lobules; I have seen a similar state, accumulation of bile in the marginal cells,
occasionally in Human livers ; and lastly, I have often found biliary deposits adhering
to the ducts in the oily livers of fish, occupying thus an analogous situation to that
of the bile in the preceding instances. The circumstance that oil in many cases accumulates particularly in the marginal
zone of cells, seems to me most probably accounted for by the relation of this part
to the circulating blood. These marginal cells are, in fact, the first which are exposed
to the stream of portal blood as it enters the lobular capillary plexus; they conse-
quently obtain most abundantly the oily matter therein contained, and store it up in
their cavities; this, I think, is a more probable view, according to our present know-
ledge of the habits of cells, than to suppose that the oil is transmitted from the

+ When a liver presents the * nutmeg appearance ” in the most marked manner, the following is commonly
found to be the condition of the structure. There is fatty degeneration of the marginal zone of the lobules,
which is thereby rendered quite pale; while the central part, occupying perhaps rather more than a half, is
uniformly saturated by a deep venous congestion, The cells in this part are in great measure destroyed,
reduced to a granular detritus, and the remaining ones are converted into spherical masses of orange pigment. The sanguine congestion and the pigmentary accumulation are precisely coterminuus.
