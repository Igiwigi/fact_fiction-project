3°3. The free torsional vibrations of a thin isotropic visco-elastic non-circular cylinder.

The solution of the problem for a circular cylinder breaks down in the case of a non-
circular cylinder because the z-component of traction across the curved surface does not
vanish. Nowa visco-elastic solid behaves as a perfectly elastic solid when in equilibrium.

A solution of the equilibrium problem, due to Satnr-VENnAanv,* shows that there is an
axial displacement given by

w= Bey,

where 2 is the twist and is constant; and the function ¢ (z, y) is a plane harmonic
function, determined by the fact that

Y — 4} (a + ¥*) = constant
over the curved surface of the cylinder, where ¥ is the function which is conjugate to ¢.

The torsional couple is C . where

joe l ad o¢g\
C= ul (+ y+ ot — 958) dedy
and is called the torsional rigidity.
