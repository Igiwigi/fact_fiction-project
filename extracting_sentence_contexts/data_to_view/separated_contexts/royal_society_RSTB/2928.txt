Whether the fleshy sarcotesta of Cycas, with its vascular strands, correspond to a
completely adnate cupule, may, perhaps, be left an open question. In any case, the
detailed structure of Cycadean seeds is a subject fully deserving further attention
and elucidation,

THe Sysrematic Posrrron or Lyyinodendron. When Binnpy, in 1866, first described his newly-discovered Dadoaylon Oldhamium,
no doubt of the Gymnospermous affinities of the plant seems to have occurred to the
mind of its discoverer. “It evidently belonged,” he says, ‘‘to the genus Pinites of
WirHam, since changed by Enpticner and Bronentart into Dadowylon.”*
Wittramson’s full investigation of the structure of the stem, published in 1873,t
left the taxonomic relations of the plant doubtful, but removed it definitely from the
Dadoxylon lumber-room ; WiuutAMson had, in fact, already separated it in 1869,
under the generic name Dictyorylon.{ Speaking of Lyginodendron Oldhamium,
