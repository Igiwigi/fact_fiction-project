However, in general (x,A) +> E"(x,A) is not continuous on (—0o, +00] x [—A.0, 0], and similarly

for (x, 4) +> E(x, 4) on [—00, +00) x [—Aco, 0]. For more on this topic, see [6, appendix].
We also let EY" too, A) denote the stable/unstable spectral subspaces of A(A).

Lemma 4.2. The subspaces Ey (x, A) have the following properties:
() EY" (x, 2) 2223 BY"(H00, a) and EN" (x, 4) “2-3 EV"(—00,2);
(ii) EY"(400,4) ND = {0} and E™"(—00, 4) ND = {0}, with D as defined in (1.7).

Proof. (i) This is a well-known fact about dichotomy subspaces.
(ii) The result E4 (—00, 4) MN D = {0} was already shown in the proof of lemma 2.11 (ii); the proof
is analogous for the remaining cases. Ld

Proof of theorem 4.1. (i) We follow the proof of a similar result from [32]. By construction, Mor(H)
is the number of negative zeros of the Evans function; that is, the number of 4 < 0 such that

ES. (0,4) AE%X(0,A) =0.

Here the wedge product / is defined to be det[u7 (a) ooo uf (Ayu (A)+++v_ (A)], where {oF @)} are
analytic bases for E* (0,4) and E¥ (0,4). A change of basis will simply multiply the determinant by
a non-vanishing analytic function, so the zeros and their multiplicities are well defined. Similarly,
Mor(H_) is equal to the number of negative zeros of the function
