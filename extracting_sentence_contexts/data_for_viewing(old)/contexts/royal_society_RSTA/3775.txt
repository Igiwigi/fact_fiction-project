and overlapping with the photo-ionization threshold at about 2.72eV converting Ni; to Ni’.
Unfortunately, absorption data beyond greater than 2.54 eV (less than 488 nm) are not reported
for the 2.51 eV centre, to the best of our knowledge, to gain insight about this issue.

Next, we discuss the strength of the ZPL and the replica. First, we note that even the ZPL of
the lowermost T) only contains 7% (*T1) contribution and 1% Debye-Waller factor, thus only
1% optical transition dipole moment is visible in the replica of 2.51 eV. Additionally, the A+ tt y(et|
spin-orbit coupling may turn (4Ag|d|*T) optically allowed by (Az/2)* © (50 meV/2510 meV)* =

The missing fluorescence of the 2.51eV band may be explained by the fact that the optical
transition dipole moment is weak and /?T2), |2T1) and |?E) doublets exist between the 2.51 eV
optical transition that could lead to an efficient non-radiative channel for the 4T> excited state.
The estimated spin-orbit coupling between the 2F and 4A, states is about A+ ~ 50 meV, which
mediates the intersystem crossing in the non-radiative process.

(b) The 2.56 eV ODMR centre and Ni?

The 2.56 eV ODMR centre is associated with the ground state of Ni; but observed in luminescence
which may be explained by the optical emission from Ni? as speculated in [24]. We discuss this
scenario in the light of our results. One of the 3E excited states could be calculated with relatively
high accuracy at 2.61 eV which is resonant with the calculated photo-ionization threshold energy
at 2.62 eV. The excitation energy of the other three triplet excited states could not be well calculated
