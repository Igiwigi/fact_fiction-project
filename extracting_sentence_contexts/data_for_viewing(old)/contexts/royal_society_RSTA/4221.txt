in quantum mechanics outside the experimental context. The apparatus constitutes the necessary
conditions for attributing a classical property, and, together with an actual outcome, they form
the necessary and sufficient conditions of attributing such a property.

The essential lesson of the analysis of measurements in quantum theory is thus the
emphasis on the necessity, in the account of the phenomena, of taking the whole
experimental arrangement into consideration, in complete conformity with the fact that
all unambiguous interpretation of the quantum mechanical formalism involves the fixation


of the external conditions, defining the initial state of the atomic system concerned and the
character of the possible predictions as regards subsequent observable properties of that
system. Any measurement in quantum theory can in fact only refer either to a fixation of the
initial state or to the test of such predictions, and it is first the combination of measurements
of both kinds which constitutes a well-defined phenomenon. [19]

In other words, Bohr suggested that the word ‘phenomenon’ should refer to an observation in
which it is impossible to separate the behaviour of a quantum system from the experimental
context in which it takes place. The reason is that, if a reference to the experimental set-
up establishes the necessary condition under which we meaningfully can ascribe a particular
property to the system, it is the experience of the outcome of a measurement that constitutes the

phenomenon.

Turning our attention towards QBism it is more difficult, at least for me, to say whether : =
