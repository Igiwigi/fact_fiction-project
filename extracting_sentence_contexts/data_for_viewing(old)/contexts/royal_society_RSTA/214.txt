5. Conclusions and outlook

The creation of the first low energy antihydrogen atoms in 2002 has spurred a
massive increase in the interest in antimatter physics and the race is now on to
try to trap the anti-atoms and compare them with their matter counterparts.
This research is challenging, as the temperature of the antihydrogen formed
must be much lower than in the original experiments in 2002 in order for it
to be magnetically trapped. Further complications arise from the fact that no
appropriate way seems to exist to slow and cool the atoms to aid in trapping,
such that the experimenters are forced to make the atoms inside the neutral trap.
This feat has only recently been accomplished.

However, in spite of the difficulties, the physics payoff of a successful
comparison of hydrogen and antihydrogen can be very large indeed. If any
difference is found between the properties of these two the call is out to
reformulate quantum field theory, one of the most successful theories of the
twentieth century and the foundation of much of modern physics.
