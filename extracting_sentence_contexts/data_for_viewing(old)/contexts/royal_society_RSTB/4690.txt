have branched off from the Holectypoid stock, the ambulacral structure of
Trematopygus seems explicable on that principle, though remaining none the less
surprising. But if Galeropygus, which must surely be claimed as the parent of the
Nucleolitidse, were evolved from some Diademoid ancestor independently of Plesi-
echinus, the appearance of typically Holectypoid structures in its descendants would
hardly be credible. Much more study of the ambulacra of the Nucleolitoida is
needed before the suggestions made above can be considered proved, but they seem

to be the only ones possible, in the light of facts and morphogenetic tendencies as
yet known.

A somewhat similar, though far less extraordinary, feature is illustrated in
Plate 68, fig. 5. Clypeus sinuatus has petals in the most complete stage of develop-
ment attained in the Jurassic period (see Plate 68, fig. 6), and also possesses well-
developed phyllodes. But, in the parts of the ambulacra that intervene between the
two specialised extremities, the characters shown are distinctly Holectypoid. The
pore-pairs are triserial, and the tuberculation is very regularly repeated on every
third plate. The plates concerned are tending to revert to Bothriocidaroid pro-
portions, showing a considerable difference from those similarly situated in Galero-
pygus, and with this reversionary character there appears a regularity of ornament
and disposition of the pores that strongly recalls the corresponding features in many
