Taking into account this history, and the considered opinions of such workers as
de Beer, it is plain that paired or unpaired centres of ossification are valueless as
criteria in this problem at least, and cannot be used for identifying homologues of
either the palatine processes of the premaxillae or the vomer. Since centres of ossification are useless in this problem, the only evidence provided
by embryology is that of the relations of the debated bones to the surrounding
structures, in particular to the cartilaginous neurocranium. The fact that the embryo-
logical evidence as interpreted by most previous writers is in direct conflict with the
palaeontological evidence makes it important that comparisons should be made on
as wide a scale as possible, both in regard to the number of forms which are compared,
and also with regard to the number of “landmarks” which are used as points of
reference. Up to the present the embryological evidence has been drawn largely from a
comparison of the embryos of Ornithorhynchus and Lacerta, but, since the form and
relations of the mammalian vomer are undoubtedly associated with the formation
of a false palate, it is worth while examining the structure of the nose in the Chelonia
because in this group a false palate may be developed and there is no debate as to
the identity of the premaxillae and prevomers. The work of Kunkel shows that the prevomer of Emys develops from paired
rudiments which soon fuse.
