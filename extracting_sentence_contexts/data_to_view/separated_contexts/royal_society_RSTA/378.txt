In none of the references cited above is this equation given in its most general terms. Careful examination of its derivation shows that (3-3) is restricted neither to a perfect gas
nor to one whose specific heats are constant, but is applicable to any fluid provided E is
a function of T only. The dissipation function is given by

& = wl2V{(9V) 93+ 0 —29V4 —§4?], (3-4)
and is unaffected in form by the fact that viscosity is a variable. An alternative form of the energy equation can be obtained in terms of the enthalpy; it is

pa —# = 6+. V{(KV) T}, (3:5)
but since in this form it is now assumed that both EF and Jare functions of T only this equation
is necessarily restricted to a perfect gas, but no restriction to constant specific heats is as
yet implied.
