— The red area is elasticity dominated (ED) which includes experimental results reporting
purely elastic instabilities (FP, DW).

— The blue area is the intermediate region (INT) in which the elastic and inertial effects
compete, resulting in a transition with the appearance of RSW. Surprisingly this regime
includes only moderately elastic, non or slightly shear-thinning Boger fluids.

The plot clearly illustrates the suppressing effect of shear thinning on the elastic instabilities
as reported by [23,68] as at high values of 8, the ID region extends to high values of El. In the
boundary between ED and ID, the experimental data of [23], denoted by cyan circles, exhibit
a strong variety of co-existing elastic and inertial instabilities. The boundaries between ED and
INT on the other hand are not very clear, as interpenetrating areas exist: the FP also appears at
moderate elasticities (E! < 1) and close to the semi-dilute regime (f > 1). This fact may suggest


that the weak polymer entanglement without substantial shear thinning, normally obtained for
PAAM solutions, can enhance the elastic behaviour of the fluids. Another explanation is due to
the different methods and inconsistencies in the definition of polymer relaxation time and El. The
graph also implies the existence of a triple co-dimension point (TP) in the chart at which there is
a balance among inertial, elastic and shear-thinning effects. At this point, TVF, RSW and FP could
have a significant role in the same transition sequence.

Point ‘1’ in figure 7 illustrates a TVF/RSW coexistence without the appearance of FP in the
transition. This implies that this point is more of a co-dimension point between shear-thinning
and moderately elastic fluids. Instead, point ‘2’ in figure 7 illustrates all TVF, RSW, and EIT and
