be, therefore, that in a certain number of human brachial plexuses the IInd thoracic
does not contribute to the innervation of the hand muscles ; and certainly in Macacus
the amount of contribution by it varies, for I have in some individuals failed to evoke -
contraction of the deep flexor of the forearm through it, though this is often readily
done. On the other hand again, it is possible that the segmental position of diaphragm
(or rather of phrenic nerve) may vary independently of that of the musculature (or
nerve-trunks) of the limb; but this supposition is not in harmony with the rule I
found deducible from the lumbo-sacral plexus, viz., “the shifting up or down of
the region of outflow along the cord applies vo all the efferent fibres of that
length”; in other words, although each muscle (nerve-trunk) is displaced absolutely,
it is not displaced relatively to its neighbours. LaNncury’s researches on the
Sympathetic show that, to use my own nomenclature, the cervical sympathetic is
more prefixed in the Cat and Dog than in the Rabbit ; a fact in accord with the not
infrequent absence of the contribution from IInd thoracic noted above in the Cat
(and Dog). Ktumexr’s conclusion from clinical data, that in Man the dilatators of the
pupil emerge from cord entirely in the Ist thoracic root, is almost certainly not
correct. We know of no type, including Monkey, in which the outflow of dilatators is
limited to one root, and Brun’s case shows that in Man some leave by a root lower
than Ist thoracic. Yet Kiumpxe’s evidence makes it probable that they leave in
man chiefly by Ist thoracic, If so, then the evidence from the sympathetic, and also
from the phrenic, points to the nerves and muscles of this region in Man being
prefixed, as compared with Macacus and the laboratory types. This fact may be
