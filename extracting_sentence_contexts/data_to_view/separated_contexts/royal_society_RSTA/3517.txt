In fact it requires only 10 average quiet days to bring about a
decrease in I equal to the secular change observed in an entire year. The absolute magnitude of the non-cyclic change in I, as we see from Table X.,
does not vary very conspicuously with the season of the year, but relative to the
range of the diurnal inequality it is most important in winter. In January, in fact, it
averaged fully 30 per cent. of the range of the proper cyclic diurnal variation. ยง 17.
