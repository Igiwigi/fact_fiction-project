Bent, 0 Notch, 2 Notches (by comparison with the
whole of the A series and the whole of the Long S series). 'The thermometers described
as Bent 0 Notch and Bent 2 Notches are otherwise marked R and L, and are the ther-
mometers which were inserted in the quicksilver trough, and on which in fact almost
the whole of Mr. SHEEPSHANKs's operations in the comparison of his own standards
depend, 80 far as they are influenced by temperature. In some few instances, how-
ever, the temperatures depend on 7 and s (bent thermometers with small bulbs which
were inserted in holes in the bars). The freezing-points and the inequality of gradua-
tions of L, R, 7, s were determined independently, but not the boiling-points.
