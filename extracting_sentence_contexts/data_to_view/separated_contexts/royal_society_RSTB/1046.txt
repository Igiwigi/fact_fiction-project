a (B.) Drrrerentriation or THE GerminaL Layers. g With respect to the origin of the mesoblast and hypoblast of the Nauplius, the
Girripedes oceupy an isolated position among Crustacea. a They differ from Cetochilus (35) among Copepods, Moina (65) among Phyllopods,
d from Astacus (73), and most other Decapods, as well as from Ligia among Isopods
@ in the fact that the hypoblast and mesoblast do not arise as multicellular areas
srming a specially differentiated and separate portion of the blastoderm, but from a
@mmon source, the single yolk cell, the nucleus of which is derived from the last,
possibly, in rare cases, from one of the last formed cells completing the blastoderm
Sd filling the blastopore. e The mode in which the mesoblast and hypoblast are differentiated, presents most
â€˜semblance among Decapods to that found in Palemon and Eriphia, where the
Besoblast arises from the invaginated portion of the blastoderm, which also forms the
Biid-gut (and hind-gut).
