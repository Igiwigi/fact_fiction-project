On the contrary, during the
summer when there is nearly permanent sunshine, ascending currents will be formed
at all times of the day and night. This accounts for the winter maximum and the
summer minimum of the radio-activity. One strange fact is that the activity should be so high during the winter when the
whole country is covered with snow. This at first led me,t with other observers, to
doubt Exster and Gerretâ€™s theory, but the reason is not hard to find if it is
remembered that the snow must form a very large reservoir to hold the emanation as
it is escaping from the soil. It would be interesting to see if air, drawn from the
; snow in the way Ersrer and Gerret drew it from the ground, would be charged
with emanation.
