* The arguments on which-I have founded my opinions have
hitherto been all taken from the hollows in our surface, and the
interruptions in our-strata, both which, the concomitant circum-
stances have led me to consider'as s0 many excavations; but
the lofty elevations, and the abrupt prominencies rising sud-
denly from our surface, when minutely examined, lead us
irresistibly to the very'same conclusion. When you andI examined together the line of our northern
fagades, we studiously sought for the points where nature
had made any change in her materials or their arrangement,
hoping that at the junctions of these little systems, we should
find some facts that would throw light on the subject; but
we generally failed ; want of perpendicularity, or other local
circumstances, impeding us at the most interesting points. On the present occasion she has adopted an opposite line of
conduct, and in many of the steps she has taken, obtrudes
upon us: demonstration of what she has done. Whoever has attended to the exertions of man, when em-
ployed in altering our present surface, either by levelling
heights, or-by making excavations, must have, observed that
it is the practice of the workmen to leave: small, cylindrical
portions standing, for the purpose of determining the height
of the old surface, and thereby ascertaining the quantity of
materials removed.
