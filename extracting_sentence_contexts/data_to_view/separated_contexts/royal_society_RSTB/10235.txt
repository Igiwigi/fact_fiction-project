Another interesting aspect about oomycete gen-
omes is that they exhibit variations in ploidy and can exist as
either triploids or polyploids [23-25]. The relevance of this fea-
ture is currently not fully understood, however, polyploidy has
been shown to enhance vigour and buffer mutational changes
by masking deleterious alleles [26], and is therefore believed to
play a vital role in pathogen success. In fact, many successful P.
infestans clonal lineages are made up of triploid genotypes [26]. Here, we discuss seven oomycetes that are emerging or
re-emerging threats to world agriculture, horticulture, aquacul-
ture and natural ecosystems. They were selected based on their
impact on economy and society, and include both well-known
and understudied pathogens of both plants and animals.
