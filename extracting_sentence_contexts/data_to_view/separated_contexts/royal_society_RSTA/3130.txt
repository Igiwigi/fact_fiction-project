The price to
pay is that one of the basic notions that distinguishes probability from general measure theory,
namely conditioning, was absent in this approach. An indication that von Neumann was aware
of this is that he devoted a long manuscript to the quantum conditioning problem. The fact
that this manuscript was never published is an indication of the authorâ€™s dissatisfaction with
its conclusion (which amounts to an algebraic version of the usual Bayes formula: today we
know that this is not the correct answer). This manuscript was later published under the editorial
supervision of Halperin [12]. The attempts to introduce a notion of quantum conditioning in
the context of C* and von Neumann algebras have a long history, which eventually led to the
conclusion that, in von Neumann algebras, there is an analogue of the conditional expectation,
but contrarily to the classical case, in general it is not a projection [13].
