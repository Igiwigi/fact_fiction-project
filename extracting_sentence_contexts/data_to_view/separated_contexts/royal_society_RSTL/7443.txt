The method of procedure was as follows:

1. Ordinates were erected at every hour and half hour, careful attention being paid to
the times of commencing and ending, which were in every case indicated by entries made
on the photographic sheets by the Kew observers. In placing the ordinates, it was
asswmed that each sheet had moved with uniform velocity through its whole length,
but it was not assumed that different sheets had moyed with the same velocity ; in fact
the difference in the lengths of the curves, taken in connexion with the times of begin:
chowed that the velocities of different sheets must haye differed by (in
extreme instances) about 5 per cent. As it was impossible therefore to use one times

Scale for all the curves, about twenty different time-scales were prepared differing bh
nd for the measurement of each curve that scale

small gradations one from another, a
was employed which suited it best. 2.
