Fig. 3 is drawn in the same way. The defects of the arrangement in fig. 3, considered as representing the shape of
the continental block, are sufficiently obvious, the chief being the absence of any
indication of an Arctic ocean, and the almost complete submersion of South America. On the other hand, the fact that even tolerable agreement in so many respects is
obtained from a spherical harmonic analysis of the extremely simple distribution
detailed in the table of § 56 may be regarded as a confirmation of the theory which
led us to assume that harmonies of the first, second, and third degrees should be
predominant. Geological Implications of the Theory.

62, The results appear to admit of a geological interpretation. We have adduced
dynamical reasons for the hypothesis that the lithosphere consolidated in a shape
which may be described as an ellipsoid with three unequal axes, with its centre
of gravity displaced from its centre of figure, and with a wrinkle upon its surface
expressed by spherical surface harmonics of the third degree ; and we have found that
the figure of the lithosphere now, as determined by difference of level above or below

* The coefficients 7, «, a, }, ¢ are especially sensitive to changes in the assumed distribution in the Arctic
and Antarctic regions where the actual distribution is least known.
