We have also calculated formulze for the specific heats of air under constant pres-
sure and constant volume, by which the variations of these elements with the tempe-

facts, other equations of condition will have to be introduced and other constants of
the empirical formula determined, to do away with the discrepancies; but probably
no experiments have yet been made of sufficient accuracy to test them. The following expressions are derived from the general equations (7) and (8) for
the mechanical values of the specific heats of a fluid, by substituting for p the parti-
cular expressions for the case of air afforded by the empirical formula (39), and inte

Lastly, denoting the ratio of the specific heats, 5 by k, and the particular value, ry
corresponding to the case of extreme dilatation, by k, we have, to the same degree of

In the Notes to Mr. Jouzz's paper on the Air-Engine#, it was shown that if MavzR's
hypothesis be true we must have approximately,
