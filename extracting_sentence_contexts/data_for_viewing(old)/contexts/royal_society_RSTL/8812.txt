He als showed that the freezing-point and the point of maximum density were pro-
portionate to the quantity of saline matter in the water, and that both therefore varied
with the degree of salinity of the sea.

The effects of pressure and the properties of fresh and salt water were therefore per-
fectly well understood previous to the date of Ross's voyage. How, then, the unsup-
ported opinion of one who, though a most able and enterprising navigator, had not any
pretensions to an exact knowledge of physical science could haye been accepted by
scientific writers of 80 much eminence is a singular fact, I can only account for it by
the circumstance that the 8ubject had not been made in this country one of special
investigation, and therefore the results*of Ross's work had not been questioned by any
competent special authority. In fact they had never been discussed.

The observations of Lenz, Du Prrmt-Taovars, and others, combined with the
researches of physicists, had gufficiently established the law of the decrease of tempe-
rature with the depth to 2* to 3* above the zero of Centigrade in the temperate and
tropical zones of both the great oceans; and their conclusions could hardly be consi-
dered as seriously affected by the unsupported though ingenious hypothesis of D'URvILLE
and Ross. LeNz had obtained, by means of his bathometer, with corrections for change
of medium, the low readings given at p. 599; and subsequently Du PerIT-Tuovars by
means of protected thermometers had obtained directly, without correction}, amongst
a number of others at lesser depths, the following deep-sea temperatures :—
