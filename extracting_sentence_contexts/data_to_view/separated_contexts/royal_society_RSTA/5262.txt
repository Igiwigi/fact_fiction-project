Attached to several of the
curves are the diameters of the wires expressed in millimetres. These numbers are
stated to four decimal places, but it would have been better to have given, as in the
above Table, only three significant figures, this being the probable limit to the
gecuracy of the measurement of the diameters.
& Suspecting that some of the results of published experiments on the currents
®quired to fuse wires had been much influenced by the cooling action of the blocks
& which the ends of the wires were attached, we started by making a calculation on
Hie length necessary to give to our wires so that the loss of heat by conduction
hould not introduce any important error into the determination of the emissivity. Bo do this it was necessary to calculate the distribution of temperature along a wire
#hrough which a steady current was flowing, and from which heat was lost by
tadiation, convection, and conduction, and it was further necessary to improve on the
€leulation one of us had published on this subject in the ‘ Electrician, for 1879, by
‘Bow taking into account the fact that the emissivity, as well as the thermal and
Blectric conducting powers of the wire, were different at different points in conse-
‘quence of the difference of temperature. Such a calculation has not, as far as we are
ware, been hitherto made, it having been assumed in all previous investigations that
éhe effect. due to the variation of the thermal and electric conducting power of the
paterial with temperature, as well as the variation of the emissivity per square
¥entimetre with temperature and with the diameter of the wire, could be neglected.
