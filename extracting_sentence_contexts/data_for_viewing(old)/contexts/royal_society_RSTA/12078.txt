SprorrRA OF THE BESSEMER FLAME.

Description of the Spectrum of the Bessemer Flame, as photographed at Crewe,
January, 1898, at the Steel Works of the London and North-Western Railway
Company.

The lines of the alkali metals .appear, and are, in fact, the only prominent lines
during the first period of the ‘ blow,” when the silicon is being oxidised and slags are
in course of formation. During the second period, or the “ boil,” the flame exhibits a
continuous spectrum of bright rays, overlying which is a number of bright bands ;
some of these appear to be degraded towards the least refrangible rays, others do not
appear to be degraded, but are bounded by lines, or by very narrow bands, possibly
by the sharp edges of bands. There does not appear to be any distinct fading away
of bands in the direction of the least refrangible rays more than towards the blue. At
the commencement of the “boil” the bands are not so numerous as afterwards, nor
are the lines so strong and numerous as subsequently, excepting the lines of the alkali
metals. It is noticeable that certain lines appear only at the commencement of the
“boil,” others do not appear until the end. There is no very great difference between
the spectra taken at the close of the “boil,” and at the commencement of the third
