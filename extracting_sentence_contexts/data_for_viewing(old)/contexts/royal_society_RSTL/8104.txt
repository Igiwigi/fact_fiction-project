herbivorous that the family to which it belongs has been- regarded as representing in
the Marsupialia the Ruminants of the placental Mammals. With this fact before us,
is it likely that the premolars of Plagiaulaz and Thylacoleo © were applied to cut and
divide flesh'?”

To this I reply ; consider the difference of the molar teeth following the trenchant
one in Plagiaulas and Hypsiprymmus respectively, and the true solution will be given}.

$ 14. Interrupted and continuous applications of Teeth.—The deduction of the
carnivorous nature of the extinct Marsupials in question was drawn not from shape
merely, but from correlation of teeth. The © arbitrariness,” if sach quality be predi-
cable of the conclusion, is applicable to the guiding principle, not to the palzontologist
confiding therein. If reference to confirmatory and collateral facts was omitted in the
Papers of 1859 and 1869, it was under the belief of their being the common property
of the interpreters of fossil remains.

In the adaptively modified dentition of the class Mammalia the differently shaped
teeth are put, some to occasional and interrupted, others to continuous use. The
incisors of the child biting a piece of bread and butter exemplify the first functional
character ; the molars which pound the piece bitten off, the second. These incisors are
trenchant or sharp-edged like the premolar of a Bettong or the carnassial of a Cat;
their action in the human subject leaves a clean semicircular border of the bitten slice.
The teeth, of whatever kind, incisors, premolars, or molars, which have the continuous
work 8hoy its effects by an abraded surface. Those which have the occasional and in-
terrupted work show little or no indication of 8such. The laniaries of Carnivora, when
