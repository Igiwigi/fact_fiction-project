Marco Porto and other travellers, influenced by which Professor BraNcont, of
Bologna, has endeavoured to prove in several Memoirs that the Aepyornis was a bird
of prey allied to the Vulture.t

The legends referring to gigantic birds may not necessarily be considered as a proof
of their contemporaneity with Man, as they might have been originated by the view
of the enormous eggs. In the same manner as the fables relating to monsters and
amazons inhabiting the island of Samos, and which are reported by AULIANUS and
Prurarcn, owe their origin to the acquaintance of the ancient Greeks with the great
quantity and occasionally enormous size of (Miocene) bones met with in that island.t

The opinion that the Aepyornis was contemporaneous with Man is, however,
strengthened by the fact stated by Mung Epwarps and GRANDIDIER, viz., that on
one of the tibie, “On voit 4 Vextrémité supérieure des empreintes profondes
pratiquées 4 Taide d’un instrument tranchant ; il semble évident que ces incisions
ont été faites en coupant les ligaments du genou pour séparer les os de la jambe de
celui de la cuisse, et elles décélent la main de l’homme.”§

Moreover, on one of the fragments of metatarsus are to be seen, according to the
same authors, some superficial cuts or scratches (incisions), very similar to those found
sometimes on bones from caves and considered to be the work of Man.||

On the mandibula of the Megaladapis scratches are also seen which have the
appearance of age, and which seem to have been produced by some cutting instru-
ment; but they may also be referred to the action of sharp-pointed teeth.
