HexLe (15), 1837, showed that the intestine is covered by a layer of epithelium. Goopsm (7), 1842, firs: noticed that the epithelial cells apparently contain fat-
granules. He did not, however, lay any stress on the fact, but supposed that certain
* yesicles‚Äù close to the membrane have the property of absorbing, and that the epithe-
lium is cast off previous to absorption. This author saw the membrana propria clearly,
and considered that the nuclei situated in it at regular distances were the germinal
spots from which the epithelium is reproduced. Lacarente (19), 1843, first noticed the moyements of the villi, and attributed them to
a system of muscles.
