itself requires the specification of a design storm duration and an associated design intensity or
depth, with a corresponding temporal pattern to represent variations in intensity for the duration
of the storm. Until recently, the conventional approach to design flood estimation involved using a
fixed design storm and fixed antecedent conditions, ensuring the design flood did not change into
the future with climate change. These assumptions have been found to be wanting as illustrated
in figure 1.

What are the implications of the changes in figure 1 to the design flood magnitude? The design
flood will depend on the extent of change the three factors (rainfall depth, temporal pattern and
AMC) exhibit. While a 6-7% increase in the design depth with each degree rise in temperature
follows from the Clausiusâ€”Clapeyron relationship, increases above this have been observed for
sub-daily rainfall (see [12]). There are also locations where the observed day-to-day variability of
rainfall intensity to temperature is, in fact, negative [13,14], though the negative scaling appears
to be an aberration (see [15]) forced by the unusual relationship temperature change exhibits with
the occurrence of rainfall in tropical climates [16,17]. Observed increases in tropical precipitation
extremes [18] have been confirmed in such locations using a more suitable warming surrogate
