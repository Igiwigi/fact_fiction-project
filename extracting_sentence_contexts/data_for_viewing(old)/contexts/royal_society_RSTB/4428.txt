WIELAND's (1906) description of the American C, Wielandi might have been drawn
from the present specimen, so like is this feature in the various species of Bennettites.

The cortex is quite similar to the pith, and appears to show no distinctive feature.
It is rather poorly preserved, but in a number of places the peculiar pitted cells as
described in the pith and leaf-base tissues can be seen. I have not observed any
resin cells or gum-canals.

The nucleus-like bodies mentioned by WreLANb (1906) as being conspicuous in the
medulla cells of his species, are paralleled by roundish bodies in a great many of the
cells of the cortex in the present species, which are sometimes remarkably like nuclei
(see text-fig. 17, where even the suspending threads of protoplasm can be seen). In spite
of their extraordinarily nuclear appearance, however, the fact that in some places there
are more of them than there could have been nuclei, and that in some regions where
the tissues have broken down and mineral matter only is present, identical bodies are

to be seen, some of which are rather larger than the nucleus-like ones, makes me
hesitate to accept the obvious conclusion that these bodies are true nuclei, It may
well be that nuclei formed the centres for the accretion of certain mineral substances
which also collected round other centres in different parts of the plant in process of
petrification.

The meristeles, which run in the cortex, leave the main cylinder as stout loops, and
break away from the axis as thick crescents of secondary wood and phloem. In the
course of the passage of each out through the ground-tissues of the main trunk, the
