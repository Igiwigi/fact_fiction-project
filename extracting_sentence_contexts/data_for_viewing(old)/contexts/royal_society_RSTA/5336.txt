The last equation in (4.7) is interesting insofar as that here the induced pressure component
of leading order O(c!) enters. Furthermore, in the main layer, /X= Ym /x and the pressure
induced by Wms in the UD and acting in the LD forms the component of O(e!®) in the pressure
expansion. These facts suggest a pressure variation in the vertical direction for precisely this term
of O(e!®) to come into play, since its normal gradient will be comparable in size with the leading-
order convective term in the vertical momentum equation. Consequently, the extended version of
the horizontal pressure gradient in the MD is given by

where, as in (2.6), all terms representing Taylor expansions of orders higher than O(e*) have been
omitted since they will not contribute to the results presented in the following. Most important,
all terms in this expansion, except for pm5(X, Ym, t), are identical to the corresponding components
in the LD. As already indicated by the above order-of-magnitude argument, the asymptotic
