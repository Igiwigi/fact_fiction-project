Tate two chief modifications of the normal course of the life-history of a feru,
aBogamy and apospory, are of interest in themselves, but have acquired a more
eStended importance from the possibility that their occurrence may aid in indicating
true relation between the sexual and spore-bearing generations, and so throw
Iiht on the nature of “alternation of generations” in archegoniate plants. This
sgpect has been recognised since the discovery of the phenomena, and will be best
w®preciated by tracing the progress of opinion on the nature of alternation from the
time of Hormerster to the present day. Only the more important contributions
Baring on the subject can be mentioned in this place.
— With the publication of the ‘ Vergleichende Untersuchungen’ (1851), the fact of
e regular alternation of a sexual with an asexual generation in the life-history of
ophyta, Pteridophyta, and Gymnosperms was established. HormersTer subse-
& ently extended the observation to Angiosperms. In the work mentioned, and in
e ‘Higher Cryptogamia,’ published some ten years later, no views as to the nature
@ alternation of generations are discussed. With the extension of accurate know-
ledge of the life-histories of Thallophytes, the attempt was made to compare the
different individuals of the same species of Algw and Fungi with the sexual and
asexual generations of archegoniate plants. Two main views of the nature of alter-
nation in the latter were put forward. On the one hand, Cerakovsky* regarded
alternation of generations in the Archegoniate and a few Thallophyta as essentially
different from that found in the majority of the latter group. He distinguished the
two types as antithetic and homologous alternation respectively. Princsnem,*
