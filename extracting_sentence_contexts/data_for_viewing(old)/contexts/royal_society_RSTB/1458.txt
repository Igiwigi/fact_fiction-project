5 regarded it as a superoxidised oxyhemoglobin in which the oxygen is more stably
‘= held than in simple oxhyhemoglobin. This extra oxygen could not be obtained
86 directly from aldoxime. Aldoxime is not split up by reduction. The molecule is
4 reduced as a whole, into a primary amine.
‘S In order to obtain nitrous acid. from aldoxime there must be an oxidation process.
EB Active processes of oxidation in the blood are paradoxical to the generally received
3 physiology of to-day. It is a well proved fact that active processes of oxidation take
4 place in the tissues, indeed we know that such is a necessary condition for the life
@ of the tissue cells. I cannot see why it should therefore be argued that oxidation
% processes cannot take place in the blood. The blood is also a tissue containing living
= cells. These cells must consume oxygen in the same way as any other living cells.
g Active oxygen has not been found in extra-vascular tissues any more than in the
& blood. It is a fact that reducing substances cannot be found in normal blood ; but
8 according to the experiments of Lupwie and ALEXANDER Scumipt (ALEX. SCHMIDT,
& ‘Ber. ttber die Verhandl. der Siichs. Ges, der Wissensch. zu Leipzig, Math. phys.
§ Classe,’ vol. 19, p. 99, 1867), the blood of animals, which have died of suffocation,
contains only traces of oxygen or none at all, whilst it contains reducing substances in
large quantities. Aranasstew (N, Aranasstew, ‘ Ber. der Siichs. Ges. der Wissen-
- sch.,’ vol. 24, p. 253, 1872) showed later that these reducing substances could only be
found in the corpuscles and none at all in the serum.

It would appear that these reducing substances are normally seized by the blood
corpuscles, and by them immediately oxidised, but failure to supply oxygen caused
them to be stored up in the bodies of the corpuscles,
