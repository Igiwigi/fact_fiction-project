(38.) It thus appears that the effect we have been examining, of the diffusion of


356 MR, GROVE ON THE GAS VOLTAIC BATTERY. phosphorus in gas, is not due to any peculiarity of nitrogen, and is not peculiar to
any particular gas, as once believed ; but being in all probability common to all 'gases
which do not exercise a specific action on the phosphorus, it may be more properly
called a volatilization of phosphorus at ordinary temperatures than a solubility in
gas; the ordinary slow combustion of phosphorus in air is, in fact, a combustion of its
vapour. T incline to think that the inferiority of its vaporization in pure oxygen is
due to a protecting film being formed, and that the phenomenon is in some respects
analogous to the inactivity of iron in nitric acid. (39.)
