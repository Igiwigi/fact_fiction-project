But while the gradations of the brains
of this type are tolerably regular and unbroken between the largest and the smallest of
the series (i. e. Homo and Hapale), the Lemurs do not continue in precisely the 8ame
line of degradation, but rather should be placed as a small subseries parallel to the lower
part of the large series, and distinguished from it by the shortness of the posterior lobes,
the large size of the olfactory bulbs, and the inferior condition of the cerebellum. With regard to the general characters of the posterior lobes throughout the series,
although the examination of all the forms is not yet complete, the facts which have
already been brought together are sufficient to justify the following conclusions :â€”

* A further examination of this specimen, and of the brains of zome allied genera, leads me to doubt
whether the above-described * cavity * in the posterior lobe existed before dissection, the length of time that
it had been in spirit having greatly facilitated this process. Tf it did not, it will justify the statement of
the absence of the hippocampus minor by anatomists who have looked at this 8tructure only in its relation
to the posterior cornu, but at the same time will afford a further illustration of what I have endeavoured to
show throughout this paper, viz. that the part of the brain to which this term has been applied can exist inde-
pendently of the yentricular cavity.

1. That the posterior lobes, whether we understand by the term that portion of the
cerebrum which lies over the cerebellum, or, taking our definition from internal struc-
ture, that part which is situated behind the hippocampus major, exist in all the Qua-
drumana, and are characterized in all by the presence of a deep longitudinal sulcus
(calcarine) on their inner surface.
