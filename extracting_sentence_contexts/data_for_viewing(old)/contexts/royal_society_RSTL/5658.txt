2 The form of the equation shows that IT+wP is the tangent at the point of the cubic

S The theorem contained in the last equation, viz. © that if a conic pass through four
Z consecutive points of a cubic at yz, the chord joining the remaining points passes
E through the second tangential of ay/z',” may easily be deduced independently. In fact,
£ if abe=def be the equation of any cubic, any conic ab=pde meets the cubic again in
65 two points whose chord pc=f passes through the fixed point of And hence, as is well
Z known, all conics through four points on a cubic meet the curye again in a chord pass-
Sing through a fixed point which I call the opposite of the four given points, and which
& Bs constructed as follows: Let the line joining the points 1 and 2 meet the.curve in a
Point 5, let the line joining the points 3 and 4 meet the curve in a point, 6, then the
line joining 5, 6 meets the curve in the point 7 required. Now when 1 and 2, 3 and 4
coincide, the points 5 and 6 both coincide with the tangential of that point, and con-
8equently 7 is the second tangential.

It follows immediately that the conic through five consecutive points meets the curve
again in a point which is found by joining the original point to its second tangential,
