period segmentation of the yelk took place, and an embryo was produced. This was
with fluid which had been obtained nearly an hour before it was employed. In a
further trial, with an isolated egg, to which a full quantity of fluid was added, by
three or four applications of the loaded pin's-head, after the egg had been one minute
in the water, I detected several spermatozoa, within half an hour afterwards, sticking
like the preceding into the vitelline membrane, and this egg also produced a good
embryo.

It was thus evident, that in some cases, spermatozoa certainly penetrated through
X the envelope; but as there was also one instance, in which the egg had hecome
fecundated, and afterwards produced an embryo, in which I had not seen sperma-
> tozoa within the envelopes, it was necessary to pursue the investigation further, to be
: quite assured of the fact of penetration as connected with the act of fecundation.
On the following day an opportunity occurred to me of examining the egg after
= impregnation by the natural union of the sexes. I had several pairs of frogs in
a basin of water covered by a glass bell jar. when, having my attention directed for
v a few minutes to some other object, one pair of frogs spawned suddenly, as I knew
S by the sound of a plunge or splash in the water, which always occurs after the act,
E at the moment of separation of the sexes. Nearly the whole of the eggs were depo-
= sited in a mass, but there were a few which were detached from the rest, and were
: lying at the bottom of the water. This seemed a good opportunity to examine these
eggs, which had been expelled naturally, singly, in search of the spermatozoa within

the envelopes. Fifteen of these detached eggs were placed, each in separate cells,
E and carefully examined, during the first hour and a half after their expulsion. In
