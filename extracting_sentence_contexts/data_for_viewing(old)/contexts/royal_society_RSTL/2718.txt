its arterial and venous state. If voltaic electricity operate on the same principle as
the nervous influence, it will raise the temperature of the former, but not of the latter,
which has already undergone the operation of that influence. Such was found to be
the case. The arterial blood immediately rose several degrees on coming into contact
with the voltaic wires, but there was no increase of temperature in the venous blood,
although, in hoth instances, the blood was subjected to them as it flowed from the
vessels; it having appeared from previous experiments that the delay of even a few
minntes, although no apparent change had taken place in the blood, and no elastic
fiuid had been disengaged from it, prevented any rise of temperature; s0 rapidly do
8ome of the properties of living blood undergo a change after its removal from the
vessels |.

Such being the facts, I could no longer doubt that the nervous influence and vol-
taic electricity are powers of a similar nature, and it appeared to me that this would
be most convincingly illustrated, by causing the nervous influence to pass through
other conductors than the nerves; because such a fact would, independently of all
others, prove that it is not a vital power properly 80 called, it being acknowledged
on all sides that no such power admits of separation from the texture to which it
belongs in the living animal.

With this view I made many vain attempts, and hardly escaped the ridicule of my
ass0ciates for expecting that the nervous influence could exist in any texture but that
to which it belongs in the living animal,
