Either the mean of the times of the first and fourth phenomenon, or the mean
of the second and third, or the mean of all four, may be used as the true time of
Coincidence; and it was left to the discretion of the observers to adopt which they
preferred. They chose, in every case, to observe the first and fourth only. This
amounts in fact to using only one side of the aperture. It is necessary for the success of this observation that the arc of the detached
pendulum be less than that of the clock pendulum ; in fact it was always much less. It is indifferent whether the detached pendulum vibrate quicker or slower than the
clock pendulum ; in fact it always vibrated slower.
