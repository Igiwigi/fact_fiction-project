In consequence, the


VISUAL PERCEPTION OF FINE DETAIL 619

colour of a point source will never be a pure red, or a pure blue-green, but always dilute
shades of these colours: namely, pink and pale blue-green. If, however, the point source
be insufficiently bright, even when its image does fall entirely on a single cluster, the colour
produced by that cluster maynot be perceived because vision is colourless, since the inten-
sity is below the threshold for the perception of colour as Abney (1895) has shown. The
cluster hypothesis thus accounts for four of the observed facts: (1) why a point source must=
be used; (2) why its intensity must lie between certain limits; (3) why colours are seen so
rarely; and (4) why only pale colours are seen. We have still to account, on the cluster
hypothesis, for the necessity for the source of light to be intermittent, and for it to be moving. Movements are necessary in order to prevent fixation of the source by the eye, because the
source, consisting as it does of white light, would comprise green rays which are sharply
focused, and red and blue rays which are not.
