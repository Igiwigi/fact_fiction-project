This simple proposition obscures two facts. First, it allows for molecules to be overlapping. Once recognized, this is in fact a good feature in terms of applications. An example is the ethane
molecule, C2HÂ¢, which, in terms of the present discussion, can be considered as the orbit of
C-H under its isometry group. But, clearly, various elements of this group map the C of C-H
to itself.
