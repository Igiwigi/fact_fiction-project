third electrical rises close to the last, divided only by a very thin plate of car-
tilage ; the principal portion of it passes into the electrical organ and ramifies
through its inferior part, and besides, gives off three small branches, which are
sent to the adjoining branchize, to the gullet and stomach, and to the tail. The
branch which supplies the stomach appears to be the principal nerve of this
organ ; it descends along the inner and inferior portion of the gullet, and
ramifies in the direction of the great arch of the stomach. The caudal branch
descends in a straight line under the peritoneal lining of the abdomen, and
under the spinal nerves, without giving off a single branch till it reaches the
tail, in the muscular substance of which it is lost.

T have not yet been able to discoyer any connexions of the electrical neryes,
besides those pointed out. It is an interesting fact that the gastric nerves are
derived from them. Perhaps superfluous electricity, when not required for the
defence of the animal, may be directed to this organ to promote digestion. In
the instance of a fish which I had in my possession alive many days, and
which was frequently excited to give shocks, digestion appeared to have been
completely arrested ; when it died, a small fish was found in its stomach,
much in the same state as when it was swallowed ;â€”no portion of it had been
dissolved.

Though I have not found the temperature of the electrical organs higher
than that of other parts of the fish, or the temperature of the fish generally
different from that of the water in which it has been confined, yet it seems
probable that as the branchize are liberally supplied with twigs of the electrical
