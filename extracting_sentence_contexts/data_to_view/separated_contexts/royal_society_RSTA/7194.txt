Since the atomic weight of
tellurium is less than that of lead, it would be expected that initially tellurium would be
lost by diffusion from the vessel more rapidly than lead. If this were the only process
occurring, a dynamic equilibrium would be established in such a way that the concentration
of lead in the vapour was increased until the rates of loss of lead and tellurium from the
vapour became equal. This, however, would not lead to a progressive increase in the
relative excess of lead in the residue, which is, in fact, observed over a period of time long
compared with that required to establish equilibrium in the vapour. If the composition
of the solid is also taken into consideration it would be expected that some of the dissociated
lead and tellurium would dissolve in the solid phase, thus preventing equalization of the
rates of loss of lead and tellurium by diffusion from the container. On account of the much
lower vapour pressure of lead than tellurium it is not unreasonable to expect that in this
way a considerable excess of lead could be built up in the solid.
