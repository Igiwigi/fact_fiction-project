The curve (6), which expresses the reaction of two substances originally present in
equiyalent quantities, is a rectangular hyperbola, and when the original quantities are
infinite, the residue varies inyersely as the time. This result has been already referred
to at pages 202 & 203, where experimental evidence of' the relation has been adduced.
That evidence is, however, somewhat impaired by the fact that the numbers which
express the percentage of chemical change during the first four or five minutes fail to
satisfy this relation ; but it may be shown that this failure is probably due to the
gradual formation of one of the substances which take part in the reaction.

Let us suppose that at the commencement of the reaction there are present @ equiya-
lents of a substance A, which during the course of the reaction is gradually changed
into an equivalent quantity of a substance B, and that B reacts with a substance C of
which & equivalents are originally present ; also let be the number of equivalents of A
which remain after an interyal &, and v the number of equivalents of B which remain
after the same interval ; then, since the velocity of diminution of u is proportional to its
quantity, and the velocity of diminution of v proportional to the product of its quantity
into the quantity of c, and the velocity of increase of v equal to the velocity of dimi-
