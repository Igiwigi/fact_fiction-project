nebula.

We can, therefore, satisfy all the equations for a vibration of frequency p == 0 by
imposing a single relation upon the constants of the nebula. The unknown solutions
which are multiplied by E, and E, have not been taken into account at all, but since
the condition that there shall be a vibration of frequency p = 0 must of necessity
reduce to a single equation, it will be clear that if these solutions had been taken
into account, we should have found it necessary to take E; = E, = 0.

Thus, in the case which we are now considering, a vibration of frequency p = 0
is equivalent to a configuration of limiting equilibrium. It is not hard to see that
this results from the fact that the particles of which the nebula is composed are
physically indistinguishable. This very fact, however, introduces a further complica-
tion into the question. It will be noticed that, although the value of € has been
found at every point of the nebula, it is impossible to determine the separate values
of Aand B. On the other hand, the physical vibration must have’ a definite limiting
form when p= 0. Now it is easy to see that a motion of the gas in which
€ vanishes at every point of the gas, and in which A and B vanish separately at the

boundary, will, in every configuration of the gas, satisfy our equations with p = 0.
Such a motion, in fact, simply leads to a configuration which is physically
indistinguishable from the initial configuration, and in which the potential energy
