On the other hand, a reference to those analyses in which hyposulphite exists in large
proportion, shows that were we to assume the whole of the hyposulphite as formed
after the remoyal of the products from the cylinders, there would exist a deficiency
in oxygen much larger than the existing exeess. Hence we may equally fairly, from
this line of argument, conclude that it is impossible to attribute to accidental causes
the formation of the whole of the hyposulphite, and that a considerable proportion
of it must be looked on either as a primary or secondary product. We now pass to the question of the amount of heat generated by the combustion of
gunpowder, and in 80 doing we may remark that we were fully cognisant of the incon-
veniences inseparable from the form of apparatus used by us for this purpose and
described in our firs memoir.* In fact, the errors likely to arise from its use were
very exactly pointed ont by ourselves,f and we were quite aware of the great advantages
in regard to saving of time and labour, and to accuracy, that would result from the
use of apparatus similar to that which we shall presently describe. But the apparatus, such as it was, was deliberately adopted, because at the time
when these experiments were made we could not be sure that the decomposition
experienced by gunpowder in its explosion when fired in considerable quantities and
under tensions similar to those existing in the bores of guns was by any means the
8ame as that occurring when it is fired in 8mall quantities and under feeble tensions.
