that the mean value of @ and Ãž is the same in
the two ellipses*. The calculation which I now give rests upon the fact, that the length
of the chord of the arc must be the same in both the ellipses, the local and the mean,
drawn through the stations at the extremities of the arc. 'There was a difficulty in
following this course before, which I have now overcome. T find the length of the are
in terms of the unknown chord and semi-axes, and then differentiate with respect to the
semi-axes, remembering that the chord is constant.
