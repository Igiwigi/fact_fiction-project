Single filament.

inquiry to make an exhaustive study of the general anatomy of the various species,
and the material available was not adequate for the purpose ; but it may be pointed
out that there are other features besides those of the gills, which suggest that a
revision of the genus is desirable. The muscle impressions in the imperforate valve
of the shell, for instance, are three in number in Anomia ephippiwm, whereas in
Anomia patelliformis there is a single impression incompletely divided into two. GILLS OF THE LAMELLIBRANCHIA. 199

Except in the fact that the two inner lamelle of the inner demibranchs are not
united at their upper edges, the gills of Placuna placenta agree exactly, both in
general and minute structure, with those of Anomia ephippium. Arcide. In all the species of Arcidee examined, the upper ends of the ascending filaments
are in ciliary connection, but it would appear that the upper ends are fused in longi-
tudinal series in Arca barbata (PELsENEER, 71, p. 188, footnote) and Arca glacialis
