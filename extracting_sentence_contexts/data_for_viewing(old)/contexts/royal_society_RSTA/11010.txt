piece, was too small to be measured, but in certain cases the character of one of the
outlines of the pit altered slightly, being a fine line at one end of the crystal, and
a narrow wedge-shaped dark area at the other. This appearance indicates a change
in the slope of that side of the pit, and thus a change of orientation of the internal
facets of the pit. This change of orientation seems therefore to occur principally—
if not entirely—in the vertical plane, 7.e., in the plane of least thickness of the
layer of tin.

Under these circumstances it seems that the term “crystal” should only be used with
some qualification in speaking of the patches developed by etching the surface of
commercial tin-plate. In a erystal which is undistorted by elastic strain constancy
of orientation of the elements is an essential characteristic of a true crystal. Some
light is thrown on this matter by the fact that we have not observed this “ concave”
appearance in samples of solid tin, but only on commercial tin-plate where we are
dealing with a very thin layer of tin adhering to sheet-iron, Even in tin-plate this
effect may be made to disappear by re-melting the tin over a flame and allowing it
to cool slowly and at rest. The appearance produced on re-etching such a specimen
is shown in fig. 31 (to the same scale as fig, 28). Here, although the crystals are
marked with a multitude of straight lines, suggesting a great number of twin
crystals, there is little or no trace of the “ concave” effect seen in fig. 28.

In view of these observations we are inclined to attribute the “concave” appear-
