chemical agencies of Electricity*.” On the decomposition of metallic salts by
the Voltaic battery, Sir Humpury is very brief. He clearly ascertained, how-
ever, that * when metallic solutions were placed in the circuit, metallic crystals
or depositions were formed on the negative surface ;” and that © the metals
passed towards the negative surface, like the alkalies, and collected round it +.”
In the course of my experiments on this subject, phenomena occurred which
led me to think that some noyel results might be obtained by instituting a
series of experiments on metallic salts, using as a Voltaic arrangement the
feeble power produced by the contact of small slips of different metals, with
Solutions of the common metallic salts. Operating in this manner, I could
readily detect very minute quantities of different metals, coat platina with
gold, silyer, copper, &c., or cover gold with a surface of these metals, and tin,
copper, brass, iron, &. Several of those facts I have been in the habit of
bringing forward and illustrating in my annual courses of lectures delivered
both in the Royal Cork Institution, and in the Royal Dublin Society. Cireum-
stances which it is unnecessary to mention, have hitherto prevented me from

giving greater publicity to those facts. In the course of the present summer
my attention has been directed to apply similar means to the detection of
