In this case there was well-marked motor paralysis in the right hind limb
with rigidity, and diminution of perception of sensory stimulation of the same limb.
she right knee jerk was exaggerated. When partly etherised the right hind limb
became flaccid and the left somewhat rigid, the knee jerk then on the right side was
“greatly exaggerated and marked clonus present. These facts were noted just before
“ghe experiment now to be described. Eighty-four days later the cord was exposed
= divided below the lesion, and the central end of the whole cord connected with
he galvanometer electrodes. (See fig. 9.) The two cortices were then exposed and
excited with an intensity of stimulus indicated by coil 8000 for 5 seconds. The following definite results were obtained :—

In the first place excitation of each hemisphere evidently produced unilateral
epileptic fits.
