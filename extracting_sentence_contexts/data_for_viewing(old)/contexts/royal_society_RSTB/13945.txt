response to noise, similarly to the Lombard effect in human tic parameters may highlight a rare ability of vocal plasticity
speakers. The flattening in the spectral tilt observed for pup G in harbour seal pups. It has been previously shown that
under noise was approximately 0.31 dB/octave (no additional elaborate control over the vocal apparatus provides a bio-
flattening from low to high noise condition). A similar change physical mechanism for vocal learning. Thus, laryngeal
(flattening of 0.27 dB/octave) in spectral tilt occurs in human plasticity and vocal flexibility may provide indirect evidence

speakers speaking in quiet versus 82 dB SPL background for vocal learning in harbour seals’ puppyhood [28,38,75].


fo is a major feature shaping human singing and speech
production. Frequency modulations may be physiologically
more demanding to perform than temporal or amplitude
modulations; in fact, several anatomical and dynamic fea-
tures affect fo, such as length, tension and stiffness of the
vocal folds [38,76]. Therefore, controlling fo requires neuro-
muscular control over several anatomical _ structures
whereas duration and amplitude of a sound are mostly con-
trolled by modifications of exhalation.

In humans, vocal learning requires control—mediated by
the laryngeal motor cortex—over multiple phonatory struc-
tures linked to both the source and the filter [77,78].
Neurobiological studies, based on electrical stimulation and
localized destructions, showed that the laryngeal motor
cortex has a key role in volitional control of vocal fold move-
