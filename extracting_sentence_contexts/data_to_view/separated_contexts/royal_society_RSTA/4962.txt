In a key strategic move, Newton switches to a different and little-studied instrument—the
prism—for exploring the nature of light. Rewriting his repeated trials, mistakes and cul-de-sacs
as a logical and systematic investigation, he makes his conclusions sound inevitable and hence =
unchallengeable—and by concealing vital details, such as the type of glass or shape of the prisms, :
Newton renders replication extremely difficult. The paper has no sub-titles, but Newton presents his case in four stages, inviting his readers nee)
to follow him on his journey from plain experimental fact towards a quantitative theory of light :
supported by empirical verification. For more details, see Zemplén’s ‘The history of vision, colour & ne]
light theories’ [9]. DNS

(a) Stage 1 13

In this artfully naive account, Newton reports that he started out by observing how a circular
beam produces a rectangular spectrum on being passed through a prism (even though it is more
pear-shaped).
