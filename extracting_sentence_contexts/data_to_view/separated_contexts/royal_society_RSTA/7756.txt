The v — displacement shows that all planes »’ = constant have changed into
planes passing through the axis of the cylinder. This is quite a natural thing to
expect. In fact, from a physical point of view it is the simplest change which
can happen to a plate bent into a cylinder. IV—Torsion or A Ricur CrrcuLtar CYLINDER
16—Need for Extension of the Present Theory

The necessity of calculating the torsional couple on a circular cylinder to a greater
degree of accuracy than what exists in its present well-known value, ducra’‘, has
been recognized by various authors. Samvt-VENANT himself has calculated the
correction which should be added to it if powers of < higher than the second
can be neglected. ‘To this we shall refer later.
