Yet, on the other hand, it hath been obſerved,
that even the German ſpaw ſometimes hath proved
£00 irritating in ſome tender conſtitutions, where our
ordinary milder chalybeates have ſucceeded well; and
we are otherwiſe informed, by an accurate obſerver,
that, in ſome tabid caſes, particularly that called the
galloping conſumption, the mildeſt and lighteſt of our
own chalybeates, and even altho' blended with milk,

have been found to increaſe the heQtic heats and
tenſion of the pulſe. Now, this obſervation ſeems not eafily reconcile-
able to another of Dr. Horſeburgh, in the place
above-mentioned, on the Hartfell ſpaw (a much
ſtronger and harſher chalybeate than either the Ger-
man ſpaw, or any of our ordinary chalybeates), viz,
that it hath actually been given, with notable ſucceſs,
from half a pint to a pint a day, in conſumptions of
the lungs, far advanced, even attended with heCtic
heats and night ſweats. So memorable a fact, in the cure of a deplorable
diſeaſe, deſerves attention ; and the Scotch phyſicians
in that neighbourhood are called upon to corroborate
it by further obſervations ; as how long thoſe cures
ſtood, and how far they may have been confirmed by
the like ſucceſs in ſimilar caſes; whether uſed with or
without milk ; and laſtly, whether, as an acid auſtere

_medicine, they may cool, correct, and give a better
conſiſtence, in a colliquative ſtate of the blood ; ſeerns
well to deſerve further inquiry, and that the reſult
ſhould be communicated for the public utility. There had indeed formerly obtained a general
prejudice againſt the uſe of the ordinary chalybeates
in diſeaſes of the lungs; but, at length, experience
hath convinced us, not only of their ſafety, but uſe-
fulneſs, and good effects, eſpecially when tempered
with milk, in many of thoſe caſes. And moreover,
it is but doing juſtice to our acid vitriolic waters, to
acknowlege, that the empirical trials made on them
by the giddy vulgar haye been frequently ſuch, as
demonſtrate, not only their ſafety, but even power-
ful effeQts in other rebellious diſorders; as, particu-
