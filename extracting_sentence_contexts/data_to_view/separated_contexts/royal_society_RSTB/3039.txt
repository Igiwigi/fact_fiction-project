Howern.t confirmed this result, and showed that it is
confined to extracts of the posterior lobe. He further found that the elevation of
blood-pressure occurs in spite of the fact that the heart may be markedly inhibited
and the pulse far slower during the action of the extract; he determined this
inhibition to be a peripheral effect, since it continues even with the vagi cut. But
the most interesting fact observed by HoweEtt is the immunity which a first dose of
any magnitude} confers, so that if a second dose is injected intravenously within a
given time—about 30 to 60 minutes, depending upon the amount of active material
used for the first injection—no second rise of blood-pressure or accompanying cardio-
inhibitory effect is produced, The results obtained by Howktt were confirmed by
Scuirer and Vincent.§ In many eases the rise of blood-pressure which is character-
istic of the first injection of pituitary extract is preceded by a slight fall of pressure. When a second and succeeding doses are given within the period of immunity the
effect.
