S With regard to the manner in which the abnormal condition of the blood was brought
5 about in these cases, it has been already mentioned in Section I. that the galvanic cur-

Z to think such an effect likely. It may, however, seem not improbable that the galvanic
S Shock might, by its direct action upon the blood within the vessels, reduce it to the
