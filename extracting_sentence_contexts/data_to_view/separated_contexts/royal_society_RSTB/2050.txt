In 1878 Mercert invented
a refinement of this method; he used paper impregnated with certain salts of
palladium and mercury, which assume a dark brown or black colour when moistened. In a hypostomatal§ leaf the paper in contact with the lower surface of leaf changes
colour, while that on the astomatal upper surface retains its original tint or, at most,
shows a change which is insignificant in comparison with the effect produced by the
stomatal side.

* The fact that Uncrr (62) (p. 335) did not find the stomata open at 5 a.m. in June is, according
to my experience, clear evidence of the faultiness of the microscopic method. + Kont (86, 95). t Mercer (78).

§ The term hypostomatal implies that all the stomata are on the lower surface; amphistomatal may
be used for leaves having stomata on both sides, and epistomatal for the rarer cases in which all
are above,
