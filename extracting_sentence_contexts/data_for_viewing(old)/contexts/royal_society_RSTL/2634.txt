columns by the posterior peaks of gray matter ; and judging from the fact that the
sensory division of the fifth pair of nervyes is continuous with these fibres, it appears
most probable they form part of the sensory tract. See Plate XXXVIII. fig. 2. 1.

The anterior set, the cerebellic fibres of the anterior columns Þ, proceed from the
front and sides of the cord, continuous therefore with the true motor tract. A por-
tion of them may frequently be seen without dissection, and have been adverted to
by several writers under the title of arciform filaments, though their termination in the
cerebellum remained undiscovered. See fig. 1. 8.

* Mr. Henmzagr Maro is, I believe, the only author who points out the fact that the restiform bodies are
partly formed by some fibres from the posterior part of the cord, but anterior to the posterior lateral fissure,
and therefore not olely by the true posterior columns. In the second edition of his Outlines of Physiology,
P. 273, he says, * On cutting through and stripping down the corpus restiforme, it is found to carry with it
the posterior lateral furrow.”

ramidal bodies, are separated from the posterior fibres of the antero-lateral columns,
already described as ascending to the cerebellum, by fibres which occupy a place in
