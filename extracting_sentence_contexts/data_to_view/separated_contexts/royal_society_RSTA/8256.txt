Since
do /dz is an elliptic function it must also have four zeros in this domain.

7.22. If a zero were to occur at the point (x, y) then by symmetry there would have
to be zeros at the points (x, y), (w, 2c — y), (2b — a, y), (2b — w, 2c — y), (b+ x, — y),
(b + «, 2c + y), that is, there would have to be eight zeros within a period parallelogram
—which is impossible. The statement about the symmetrical disposition of the points
of zero velocity is obvious from the point of view of hydrodynamics and it can be seen

from the point of view of analysis, firstly, from the fact that i = ur Sea and,

secondly, from the fact that since dw/dz is real on lines such as X = 0, then by
“ Scuwarz’s Reflection Principle ” it takes conjugate values at points which are image
points with respect to this line.

7.23. There can be four zeros in one of the following ways :—

(1) « = 0, in which case the zeros are at (0, y), (0, 2c — y), (b, — y), (b, 2c + y).
(2) y= —e, in which case the zeros are at (x, — c), (6 + a, ¢), (2b —a, —c).
(3) « = 4, y = 0, in which case the zeros are at (4b, 0), (4b, 2c), ($b, 0), (3b, 2c). VORTICES IN A CHANNEL OF FINITE BREADTH. 287

This third case is impossible for the following reasons :—

We have
f (2) f(}— 2) = 1,
so that

and

fh (D+h'G—-2 =0, where fy’ (Z) = an (Fa):

Putting Z = } we see

dz /:=w 8xb? | dZ [(Z) a=} ;

This means that if dw /dz is zero at Z = 4, then this zero is of the second order, thus
making eight zeros within a period parallelogram—which is impossible.
