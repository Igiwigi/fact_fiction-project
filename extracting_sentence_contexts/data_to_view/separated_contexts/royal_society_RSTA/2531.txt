Actually, as Knuth [13,14] points out, these recommendations are too demanding for
teachers, requiring a deep understanding of the nature and role of proof. And even when there
is agreement among mathematics educators of the relevance of ascribing to proof a central role,
several research studies suggest that turning it into a reality in the classroom is a challenging task
for both teachers and researchers [3,11]. The fact is that, ‘despite the increased attention and emphasis being placed on proof in school
mathematics, students of all ages continue to struggle learning to prove’ [18, p. 2]. Some studies
suggest that the difficulties are related to the abrupt way in which formal proof is introduced at
the secondary level [16], recommending an earlier and less formal introduction. At the earlier
levels, the students’ experience with proof could start with example-based justifications, and
continue using progressively more general and deductive arguments [16,18].
