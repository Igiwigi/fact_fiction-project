Since then, the seasonal patterns of breeding


MIGRATION OF THE DESERT LOCUST 263

and migration of the Desert Locust in single regions have been analyzed and published
(Rao 1942, for India; Waloff 19464, for eastern Africa; Donnelly 1947, for West Africa). The
subject has passed entirely beyond the stage of ingenious inference from fragmentary data,
which was all that was possible when Bodenheimer (1932) made his bold, speculative sketch
of the cycle of Desert Locust swarm movements. Information services are still imperfect
and interpretaion of the information sometimes difficult, but it is now possible to draw
conclusions on a firm foundation of facts, and even to give countries advance warning of
locust incursions. The migration patterns that have emerged from all this work are not yet complete and
present a complex and fluid appearance. Reducing the movements to a system of distinct
trends is not easy.
