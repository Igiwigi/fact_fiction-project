(31) Comparison of the Results with the Theoretical Values.—It is possible to
make a comparison of the above results with Jouy’s value for s in a manner similar
to that adopted on p. 230 for air. Jony performed two sets of experiments. The
first of these gave s as a function of the absolute density (p) in the form
s = 0°16577+0'2064p. The second gave s = 0°1650+0°2125p+0°340p’, the experi-
ments referring to a mean temperature of 55° C. In order to obtain the true value
of s) it will, perhaps, be advisable to take the mean of the two values given by the
above equations, for, although Jouy considered his second set of experiments the
more reliable, the first set applied more particularly to the lower pressures.

Thus we obtain for s) the value 0°16538 cal. per gr. degree at 55° C. Correcting
this value for the fact that Jony used the value 536°7 cal./gr. for the latent heat of
steam, we obtain s) = 0°16645, on the assumption that L = 540°2 cal./gr. This value

is expressed in terms of the calorie at 20°C. If we assume a linear law for the
variation of S with temperature over the range from 20°C. to 100° C., my own
observations give, for the value of S at 55° C., S = 0°21050 in terms of the calorie at
20° C.
