where ¢ is the Lie algebra of X and in each pair we give the (possibly quantum) symmetry group
and the (possibly quantum) space-time algebra on which it acts. The relevant factorization for
three-dimensional quantum gravity is SL(2,C) = SUz >< H3, where H3 = R? x R is the group of
upper-triangular matrices in the Iwasawa decomposition. Focusing on the first two pairs, we
have the top line of figure 3 where on the top left U(/3) is the quantum space-time
