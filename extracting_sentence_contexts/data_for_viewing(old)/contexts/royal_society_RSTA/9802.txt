be exhibited by the following scheme, where d stands for 091707 :—

D(#)—VD (2+d—99A,—1559),
D(#)—VD (3+d—1558),
D()—VD (4+d),
D()(+78)—VD (5+4),
D()(+153)—VD (6+),
D()(+33d)—VD (7+d).

The line D,,(2) is interesting. PascHEN gave it as 19859°9 with the remark
“Wahrscheinlich doppelt 1985679, 19864'6,” and he allotted 19864°6 to D,, and
19856°9 to the Principal series. But in [IL, p. 56] reasons were given against the
latter allocation. In fact the line is very close (probably within observation errors)
to the collateral formed by adding one oun to D,, The wave-length of such would
be 19857'8 = D,,(2)(+4) [see Note 2 at end].

The value of 3 is calculated as 277'89 from A,+A, = 125x0,, which gives
3 = 361°64w*. The differences as shown in the table are extremely close to multiples
of 3. Moreover, the limits of variation for the first two are so small that the
variations of RowLANn’s standards from the correct values for his scale may become
of importance. For D(3) the values should be 2 less, whilst for D (2), failing direct
observations for reduction to vacuo, recourse must be had to extrapolation on
Kayser and Runar’s formula,* which has been done. In order to bring the
