Each TSO could follow a local regulatory scheme to allocate this ex-post cost :&

to the grid users. We could further also envision that energy market operators could propose
hedging products related to these ex-post costs. To exemplify our proposal, we relied on a demonstrative application to the problem of static
N-1 security management for a fictitious three-area interconnected system. We designed such
a system with varying degrees of intra-area grid flexibility, as well as intra-area generation
resources of different cost magnitude, for the sake of demonstrating the functionality of the
settlement scheme. The results clearly showcase how the proposed scheme would reward intra-
area grid flexibility, provided that it also creates a global benefit for other external areas of
an interconnected system.
