Whether. the
saddle near 1 p.m., which is more apparent in the sunspot maximum and minimum
than in the 11-year curves, is a real or an accidental feature is open to some doubt. The V and T difference curves closely resemble one another, as might have been
inferred from the fact that the difference between ordinary and quiet day inequalities

is much larger for V than for H. The two curves, while quite unlike the ordinary
day V and T curves, closely resemble the disturbed less quiet day V difference
