To revert again to Table IX, and the excess of births over deaths. The figures for
whites are very uniform so ,far as proportion goes, they vary from 94°28 to 94°95 M.
per 100 F., the average being 94°6 ; for coloured there is much greater irregularity,
the variation being from 106-98 to 187°72 M. per 100 F., the average being 121°7 ;
but they are consistent inasmuch as the net increase in the case of whites is always
an excess of F. over M., while for coloured it is always an excess of M. over F. In spite of the fact that for each year 1904-6 the actual number of deaths shows
a regular increase for both races, there is a marked excess of births over deaths, for
both, in each of these years. But in this respect the return is not uniform. In 1905
the excess of births over deaths is highest, in 1906 it is lowest, while in 1904 it is
only slightly higher than in 1906.
