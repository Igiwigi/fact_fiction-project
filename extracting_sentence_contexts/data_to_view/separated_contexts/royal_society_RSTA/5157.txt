Similarly, where Hamilton calls explicitly for ‘governance before research’, must it be government
regulation enforced by law, or would a formalized researcher code of conduct suffice? Despite the ambiguities in these calls, there are some common arguments. From the fact that
the authors are calling for a delay in research until there is governance, and none of them calls
for currently available ad hoc governance measures to be applied, it is reasonable to infer that
these commentators perceive novel challenges from outdoors research and want new formalized
governance arrangements to be in place before it can proceed. In addition, the majority implicitly
or explicitly call for international agreement before field experimentation can begin, and it seems
a reasonable assumption that they mean multilateral convention-style agreement rather than
bilateral memoranda of understanding, for example.

The range of people calling for some variant of ‘governance before research’ indicates that this
is a view that is widely shared.
