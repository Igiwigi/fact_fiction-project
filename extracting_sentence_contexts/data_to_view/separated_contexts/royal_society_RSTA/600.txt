This is not all: when a single quantum system is measured and one of the possible eigenvalues
of the corresponding observable is obtained, the quantum system emerges in a special state such
that repeated measurements of the same kind thereafter will always yield the same eigenvalue. Such a state is therefore called an eigenstate (also ‘basis state’), and one says that the initial state
of the quantum system has collapsed into, or been reduced to, an eigenstate as the result of the
first intervention. These experimental facts allow the development of linear algebra algorithms in which the state
of a quantum system is represented by a (unit) vector in a (complex) Hilbert space; interactions,
measurements and transformations are represented by specific operators. The axes represent
eigenstates or basis states, and the squares of the projections of the state vector onto the axes
represent the probabilities of occurrence of the corresponding eigenvalues. A general quantum
state (called a pure or superposed state) is thus represented as a linear superposition of basis
states; a measurement is represented by the rotation of the state vector onto one of the axes.
