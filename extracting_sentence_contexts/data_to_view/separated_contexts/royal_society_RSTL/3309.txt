364 MR. JOHNSTON ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE RESINS,

Still it appears to me exceedingly probable, that in the rational formulze for this
and similar groups of resins exhibiting striking sensible properties, common to all,
we may hereafter find that connexion in constitution which the irrational formula
do not exhibit, and the absence of such connexion js not without its weight in favour
of the opinion, that the resins in general are not mere oxides of a carbo-hydrogen
radical, but are in many cases at least made up of two or more compound radicals. Into the consideration or development of this yiew, I do not propose to enter, until,
in the sequel of the present and in some subsequent papers, I shall have brought for-
ward facts and analytical results by which it may be better s8ustained. XIX. Euphorbium Rein.
