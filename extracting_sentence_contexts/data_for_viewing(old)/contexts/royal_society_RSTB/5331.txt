“the preliminary stages of the assimilation of the genitals—a phenomenon that is
preparatory to their coalescence and fusion in the Clypeastroida ” (p. 481).

Two facts tend to support Hawxins’ view that the Clypeastroid apical system
evolved from that of, e.g., Discoidea, namely, (1) that some Clypeastroids, e.g., Echin-
arachnius, possess four genital pores, while some, e.g. Clypeaster and Echinanthus, have
five ; (2) genitals 4 and 2 + plate x do seem to fuse to form the pentagonal plate in the
apical system of Echinarachnius. But his hypothesis is considerably: weakened by
the following facts. (1) Genital 5 is absent in the Clypeastroid which has been studied
—the spicule from which it should develop is, of course, present since it is essential
to the larva throughout its free swimming life, but it is resorbed with surprising rapidity
at metamorphosis. This seems to show that genital 5 disappeared early in the phylo-
genetic sequence. (2) Genitals 1 and 3 have also disappeared. It is unlikely that
genital 5, once lost as Hawkins postulates, should have been reacquired only to be
lost again.

Hawkins realised that his hypothesis was confronted with some difficulties. He
writes (1912, 6, pp. 470-471), “The greatest difficulty that appears when an attempt
is made to trace a phylogenetic sequence from the Holectypoida to the Clypeastroida
is the presence in the latter group of a few large ambulacrals in the adoral part of the
area, with no signs of plate crushing. Can a compound plate be resolved by evolution
