The other metals were as they are furnished in commerce as pure,

26. Each metal gives its own distinetive spectrum ; but it is remarkable that these
differences are not obvious in the less refrangible end. The true metallic spectrum, when
the sparks pass in air, is in fact combined with that due to atmospherie air, as has already
been pointed out for the visible rays by AxgsrrGar and by Are. The photographic
lines of the air-spectrum are most marked in the less refrangible portion, whilst the
characteristic lines of the metals are particularly evident in the more refrangible parts, Hence the photographs which I formerly obtained by the use of a prism of bisulphide
of carbon, which transmits rays of low refrangibility only, represent, as I then correctly
pointed out, lines which are chiefly atmospheric ; and consequently they exhibit ap-
pearances which are almost identical whatever be the metal employed.
