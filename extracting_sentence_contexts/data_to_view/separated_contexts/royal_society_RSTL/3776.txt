Thus, in the last developed specimen the second leg on the left 8ide
was reproduced, but the third one was not. This fact appears at first to support the
opinion that the reproduction of lost parts depends on the existence of special strue-
tures, situated in some portion of the base of the limb, the remoyal of which: preyents
the redevelopment of the-lost part. But this conclusion is-opposed by the fact, that,
even in those instances, in these experiments, in which the entire limb, with the
coxa or hbasilar joint was removed, a new limb was afterwards produced, or the
merest possible rudiment of a limb was developed, while in others there was no in-
dication of it whatever. When an entire limb is reproduced it is always composed of its essential parts
(fig. 4.),—coxa, femur, tibia, tarsns and claw. Besides being inferior in size, the
tarsus is often deficient in the number of its joints; and the subsidiary parts of the
limb, the articular spines, are almost always absent.
