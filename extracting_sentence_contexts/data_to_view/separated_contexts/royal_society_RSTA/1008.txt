Note that we presented a
theoretical model based on this hypothesis that semiquatitatively predicted the experimental
trends for the rigidity modulus as a function of particle concentration [28]. As for the even
higher enhancement of the rigidity modulus for anisotropic magnetic hydrogels, its origin must
be connected to the presence of the parallel strips observed in figure 3b. In fact, ina previous work,
we also developed a theoretical model which demonstrated that magnetic hydrogels consisting of
percolating cylinders of dense phase dispersed in a more diluted environment presented strong
enhancement of the rigidity modulus, in agreement with results in figure 4 [47].

Alginic acid and its salts, which are mainly obtained from the extracellular matrix of brown algae,
are biocompatible, non-toxic, abundant in source, cheap and readily available materials which

have therefore found great popularity in several fields such as biotechnology, food industry and
pharmaceutical industry [49].
