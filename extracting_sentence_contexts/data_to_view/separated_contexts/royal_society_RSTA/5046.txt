Both appeared at room temperature in detector #9 of the first COMPACT. These Fl events were separated from the main part of Pb and Hg observed at lower detector
numbers. The volatility of Fl is demonstrated by the fact that it was transported in the flowing
transport gas to the detector. The reactivity of Fl is evaluated from its adsorption on an Au surface
at room temperature, where Cn does not adsorb as readily as Pb and Hg. This indicates that
Fl is less reactive than Pb.
