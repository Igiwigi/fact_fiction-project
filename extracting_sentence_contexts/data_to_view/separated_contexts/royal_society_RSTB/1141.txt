The excitation of the anterior columns produced no effect. The results are, however, probably mixed, as will be seen by reference to the
experiment on the remaining animals. In these all connections of the sciatic nerve with the cord, except the anterior
roots, were divided ; the interesting fact then came to light that, even with a strength
of stimulus above that employed in the previous experiments, very small electrical
effects were evoked in the nerve by cord excitation, these being evoked by stimula-
tion of the posterior column of the same side and the lateral of the same side. When,
however, the strength of stimulus was increased very markedly, effects were produced
which were more marked in the case of the lateral. It is not, therefore, until the
intensity of the stimulus is far beyond the limits hitherto used that any marked nerve
effect is produced by the passage of impulses from the cord down efferent nerve
fibres.
