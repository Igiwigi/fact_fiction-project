may be absent or obscured by confluence with the sulcus fronto-marginalis. Each
of these elements is also related to a separate branch of the anterior cerebral artery.
I have already pointed out that the usual conception of three horizontal tiers of sulci
in the frontal lobe tends to obscure the fundamental morphological construction
of the sulci. This is well illustrated in these elements of the superior frontal sulcus,
for they are not horizontally, but obliquely disposed. They run from behind forwards

and inwards and tend to overlap one another in echelon. These facts were patent
to both GunnincHaAM and EBERSTALLER, but not having the work of BRoDMANN to
guide them they could not be aware that this direction of the elements is the general
direction of the cortical areas of BRopMANN. CUNNINGHAM’s statement is as follows :
“In direction they are oblique, and the posterior end of each is placed on
the outer side of the anterior extremity of the one behind, whilst the other
extremity approaches close to the mesial border of the hemisphere. EBERSTALLER
has also observed this mode of arrangement of the complete pieces of the first
frontal furrow in those cases where its continuity is disturbed by the presence

of superficial annectant gyri.”

In virtue of the fact that the sulci on the medial surface of the frontal lobe are
