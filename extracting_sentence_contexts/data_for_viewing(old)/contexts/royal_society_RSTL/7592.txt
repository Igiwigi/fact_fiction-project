observation of the objects contained in such catalogues as those of Sir Jonx HERSCHEL
and Dr. D'Arresr, since many of the objects which I examined were specially selected,
on account, of the probability (which was suggested by their form or colour) that they
were gaseous in constitution.

All the differences which I have hitherto observed between the spectra of the gaseous
nebulz may be regarded as modifications only of the typical form of spectrum which is
represented in the diagram, since they consist of differences of relative intensity, of the
deficiency of one or two lines, or of the presence of one or two additional lines. It is
worthy of remark that, 80 far as the nebulz have been examined, the brightest of the
three lines, which agrees in position in the spectrum with the brightest of the lines of
the spectrum of nitrogen, is present in all the nebulz which give a spectrum indicative
of gaseity. It is a suggestive fact that should not be overlooked, that in no nebula
which has a spectrum of bright lines, has any additional line been observed on the less
refrangible and brighter side of the line common to all the gaseous nebule.

OF SOME OF THE STARS AND NEBUL@E. 541

The faint continuous spectrum, which in some cases is also seen, has been traced in
certain nebule, by its breadth, to a distinct brighter portion of the nebula which it is
convenient still to distinguish by the term ©* nucleus,” though at present we know
nothing of the true relation of the bright points of the nebule to the more diffused
