I did not allow for the fact
that the larva always spins a film of silk over the glass for a considerable distance
round the boss from which it is suspended, and that the transparency is much
impaired in this way. Finally, it has been shown that when in the last experiment
(XIIL, B., y) there was an equally large opening to the upper as to the lower chamber
the gilt surface when above did actually produce greater results than when it was
below, although the conclusion is only supported by a pair of pupz (the sole survivors
in this experiment). Although there are so few, the fact that the only (5) out of
83 pupw was thus produced is certainly important testimony. Finally, when we
compare these results with those of the more perfect conflicting colour experiments
conducted with the frames previously described (XII., D.), and which will be further
mentioned below, we see that the above explanation of the effects produced in the
compartmented tubes is probably correct ; that such results show that the sensitive
surface is not represented by a sense-organ in the head, or with an anterior position
only ; while, on the other hand, when all the conditions of experiment are considered,
the results harmonise well with the converse theory of a general susceptibility of the
larval skin to the influence of certain colours,

C. Notwithstanding the order in which the above experiments are arranged, the
use of compartmented tubes was an earlier contrivance than the frames mentioned in
XII., D., and by the end of the last experiments I realised that the latter method
was far better, because of the equality of illumination, whether the gilt area was
above or below.
