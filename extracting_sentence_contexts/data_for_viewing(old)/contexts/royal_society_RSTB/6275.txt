contained 9 corpora lutea, of which 1 was cystic and consequently abnormally large,
and 4 were definitely smaller than the others. No signs of retained ova were found
in any of these, the mean diameter of which (excluding the cystic one) was 409 pv.
The ten large corpora lutea resembled each other histologically and had a mean
diameter of 487 Â» (excluding that which was cystic). The seven small corpora
lutea also resembled each other histologically, but differed from the larger ones.
They had a mean diameter of 309 u. The connective tissue reticulum in them was
better developed and the luteal cells did not appear so plump as in the larger ones ;
than which they appeared to be slightly older in consequence. It is clear that
either (a) all the corpora lutea formed a single set resulting from a single ovulation
or (b) that they formed two sets of 3 + 4 and 5 + 5 respectively, resulting from two
consecutive ovulations. The first alternative is supported by the fact that ten
embryos and one degenerating ovum were present in the uterus. Even if it were
assumed that the embryos were derived from the ten ova presumably liberated at
the second ovulation the degenerating ovum could only be accounted for by assuming
its persistence from the previous ovulation. Moreover, no other animal was
obtained with more than one recent set of corpora lutea. The second alternative is
supported by the histological differences in the corpora lutea, but these might
possibly have been caused by the overcrowding resulting from the presence of so
large a number in the ovaries. The fact that no other animal was obtained with
more than 12 corpora lutea in a set supports this alternative. The second alternative
postulates that the first ovulation, which may or may not have been preceded by
copulation, did not result in pregnancy and was followed by a second which did ;
the interval between the two being sufficiently short to allow of the persistence of the
