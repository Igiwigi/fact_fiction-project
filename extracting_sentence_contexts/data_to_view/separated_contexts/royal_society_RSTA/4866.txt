So our sum is

which we rewrite as

> X2,8, x" — nt"1x + (n — 1").
teF, ,xeF,

For t=0, the inner sum becomes Dxer, X28, (X"), which vanishes because n is odd. For t 40,

we use the fact that x” — nt"~!x + (n — 1)t” is homogeneous in x,t of degree n, so we write it as
8 8


t"(X" —nX +n —1) with X := x/t. The sum over t 4 0 becomes

YS x28, (¢'(X" —nX +01),

teFy .XeF,
which is the product
YY x22, (t") (= X28, (X" —nX +n — »} ,
teFy XeFy
in which the first factor vanishes (again because n is odd). a

In fact, we have the following explanation of this vanishing. Lemma 7.2. The cohomology groups HAZ [1/A], F) all vanish.

Proof.
