These ossicles of Amphiura squamata are, as ZUR STRASSEN points
out, represented in other forms by similarly placed but more substantial ossicles. We
have observed them in microscopic sections of Ophioglypha lepida as hoop-like ossicles
embracing the tentacles, articulating below with the under arm-plate of the second
segment, above with ad,, and we find that a precisely similar pair of ossicles is present
in the Liassic species Ophioderma egertoni. There can be little doubt that they are
“etwas neu erworbenes,” as ZUR STRASSEN says, of the peristomial plates, and possibly
they are the equivalent of an under arm-plate, the fact that they are double being
due to their position. It should be pointed out that Lupwie figures an under
arm-plate in the vertical wall of the oral angle (9, Plate 3, fig. 1). Sometimes each
of these little hoop-like plates is divided by a transverse suture.
