A point of special interest is the rise of the lower eyelids. This is due to an
elastic recoil of the lids when the depressor of the lower eyelids is paralysed. The
interest attached to this point lies in the fact that Cobra venom and another
Colubrine venom produce the same symptom, while it is invariably absent in the
course of Daboia poisoning. We have therefore concluded that the minimum lethal dose of our specimen of
dried Krait venom was, in the case of the frog, about 0Â°0005 grm. per kilo.
