Including education also leads to a much better model

(w = 0.98) than the cohort-only model, with women with the

6. Results ALB (table 2; ‘cohort + educaton’). Variation in education
For coherence, we report results in the order that we does not, however, account for the initial temporal change
presented our hypotheses. across cohorts in ALB given the relatively small number of

women in the higher education category and the fact that
they are limited to more recent reproductive cohorts. Never-
theless, the model suggests that the highest educational
levels might indeed delay reproductive cessation, counter-
vailing other temporal influences; this trend is nonlinear,
with women at intermediate (elementary) levels of education
actually progressing faster to a last birth. H1.
