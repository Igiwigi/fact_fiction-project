(3) By means of “ quadrant photographs” it is shown that the molecular complex
of «-keratin stretches reversibly by about 2°% before the onset of the main transformation. (4) The limiting elastic extensibility of all mammalian hairs is about 100° of their
initial, unstretched length. By combining this fact with the X-ray data exact quantita-
tive agreement is found by assigning to «-keratin intramolecular folds of the nature of
linked pseudo-diketopiperazine rings which open up on extension to produce the normal
zigzag protein chain. (5) These folds (“secondary folds”) are transverse to the general direction of the
side-chains. (6) The side-chains of §-keratin are roughly coplanar and serve to unite neighbouring
main-chains by a variety of cross-linkages, including both co-valent and electro-valent
bonds.
