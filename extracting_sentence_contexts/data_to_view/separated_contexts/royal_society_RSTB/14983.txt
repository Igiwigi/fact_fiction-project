These individual-level differences may attest to variations
in internal traits, such as energetical needs or consistent behavioural tendencies (i.e. personality), which were shown to correlate
with the individualâ€™s propensity to learn socially [27,83-87]. For example, the observed time-lag differences between the first exposure to the first tree visit suggest these bats can retain
the memory of the new information for several nights post-exposure, allowing them to weigh the costs of visiting known
resources against the benefits of exploring new ones according to their current energetical requirements, which are expected to
vary among individuals. This notion is further supported by the fact that almost all bats visited at least one tree prior to visiting
an F. sycomorus after the manipulation, which implies that all bats postponed the exploration to some degree to first use more
reliable resources. Alternatively, since bats were smeared with a large amount of fruit pulp, more than expected under natural conditions, this
could have prolonged the lifespan of the odour in the cave for several nights after the manipulation. In this case, some bats
may have delayed their response because they required additional insurance that the information was reliable.
