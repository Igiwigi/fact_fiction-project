A comparison of these two ingots only might lead
one to think that the residue was D, but a study of ingots intermediate in temperature
of chilling proves that the white residue is alpha. Forced Recalescence. The fact that ‘recalesced ingots lose all trace of the recalescence pattern when
heated above 520° C., at which temperature the beta is solid, makes us doubt if it
would be possible to trace the liquidus of Y by-seeding liquid alloys with fragments
of a recalesced alloy. But we have been able to show that beta, which, spontaneously,
does not often recalesce above 410° C., can be stimulated to do so at all temperatures
up to 515°C. The experiment was conducted as follows :—An ingot was melted, a thermocouple
placed in it and the ingot allowed to cool slowly while its cooling curve was traced on
the recorder.
