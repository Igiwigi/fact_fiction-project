According to this observer the oculo-motor may be
regarded as the first segmental nerve, whilst the descending root of the Vth belong
really to the first or second bulbo-spinal segments. My experiments have shown that
T never fail to obtain descending degeneration of the descending root, when I injure
the Sylvian grey matter in the neighbourhood of the nuclei of the oculo-motoi
They further show that these fibres pass out of the bulb without interruption, s¢
therefore, they, in all probability, correspond to efferent root fibres, and are the a
cylinder processes of- motor cells in the Sylvian grey matter, and belong to
highest segments of the bulb. In no other case have I seen evidence that the fibre
of the remaining degenerate tracts which I have described, internuncial or pyramid i
pass out into the nerve roots, a fact which accords with the results obtained by #
Go.a1 method,

The great bulk of the anterior and lateral columns consists of internuncial fibre

according to Casau, that the commissural fibres are the axis cylinder processes of
