double amount was applied in each of the last 10 years, it will be observed that there
was nevertheless a considerable falling off in the produce of hay, and in the quantity
of mineral matter taken up, during the second 10 years, where the silicates were not
also applied. Where the silicates were applied, however, the falling off in the produce
was very trifling, and that of the mineral matter taken up much less than where they
were not applied ; whilst, under their influence, there was also a considerably greater
increase in the amount of nitrogen taken up over the second 10 years.

With regard to the nitrogen, it is remarkable that, with the enormous amount, of
about 200 lbs. of ammonia, corresponding to about 164 Ibs. of nitrogen, applied per
acre per annum, for 80 many years, there was, 80 far as can be judged, as large if nob
a larger proportion of that supplied taken up by the growing herbage as where only
half the quantity was employed. There was, in fact, a proportionally much greater
increase in the assimilation of nitrogen than in the amount of total growth—that is,
produce of hay—by doubling the application. In other words, the percentage of
nitrogen in the produce was very much increased. It was, indeed, very abnormally
high ; and, as already pointed out, such a condition indicates a deficient assimilation of
other constituents in proportion to the nitrogen taken up. This result may be due to
a deficiency of available mineral constituents, or to the limitation of the climatic
characters of the 8easons for the assimilation of a larger amount of carbon by the
quantity and quality of the leaf-surface presented over a given area ; or the effect may
be due to a combination of these causes.

The further increased total yield of hay, of nitrogen, and of mineral matter, where
the silicates of 80da and lime were used, and at the same time a decrease over the
