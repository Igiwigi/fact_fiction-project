Similar changes were found following lesion of the ascending root in its
medullary course, but only below the seat of the lesion ; while, as a result of desiut
tion of the postero-lateral aspect of the medulla (tubercle of RoLaNnDo), no degeneri
was traced in the course of the root above the lesion. The descending nature of the degeneration of the so-called ascending root
fifth nerve, which we have observed, is in harmony with the observ:
BecHtEREW (55) and BreeMann (56), who likewise traced it after sectio
nerve between the Gasserian ganglion and the brain. Toorn (57) and Sa
have also confirmed the same fact. :

The general statement may be made here, that the symptoms which foll
section of this root consisted of anzesthesia to all forms of sensibility in
supplied by the fifth cranial nerve. In this respect it compared with di
posterior spinal root. Lenwossex (58) and Toors (57) have shown that the fibres of the ascen
of the fifth nerve are analogous to the middle group of fibres entering the spinal
