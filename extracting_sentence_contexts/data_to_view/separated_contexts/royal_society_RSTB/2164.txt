fluid in 40 minutes; but a tendency to group beating and to imperfect dilatation
was still recognisable. Vagus and Venous Sinus Stimulation after Diacetyl-Aconitine. Ample proof has been obtained of the fact that in lethal doses which do not act too
rapidly, a decline, and ultimately, a complete suspension in vagus activity, may be
induced by this derivative. The sinus also yields, but at a later stage than the vagus
termination within the heart. The general results of stimulation of these structures are so similar to these
produced by aconitine that reference may be made to the section dealing with this
body.
