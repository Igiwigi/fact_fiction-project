‘© columns VIII. and IX. that when the exciting primary radiation is of just shorter
§ wave-length than the bromine K radiation, the K absorption is accompanied by
2 the emission of a much smaller number of electrons than is the L, M, N absorption.
oh For instead of 205, 194, 198, L, M, and N electrons, there are emitted 87, 104, 125,
‘6 142, 144, K electrons for primary radiations of higher frequency; or for equal
5 absorptions of energy there are only about half as many K electrons emitted as
L, M, ... electrons, when the primary radiation is of just shorter wave-length than the
-2 K characteristic radiation. As primary radiations of shorter and shorter wave-length
% are used, the number of K electrons emitted more closely approaches the number

S At first sight it appears from column VIII.-as though twice as many electrons are
é emitted from C,H,Br as from air when equal absorptions of Cu, As and Se radiations
2 take place. This, however, is due to the fact that more ions are produced by a high
£ speed electron moving through C,H,Br than through air. The former is more easily
3 ionized. The factor by which the numbers 2°05, 1°94, 1°98, &c., in columns VIII.
