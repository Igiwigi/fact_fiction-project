This genus, in the structure and arrangement of its skeleton, is intermediate between


AND PHYSIOLOGY OV THE SPONGIADM. 1115

- Halichondria and Chalina, as defined in the present work. Like the former, the spicula

of the network composing the skeleton are merely cemented together, not enclosed
within a regular horny fibre; but the disposition of the network is not entirely irregular,
but like that of the latter genus, more or less composed of a primary series of lines
radiating from the axis or base of the sponge, and of secondary series connecting the
primary ones at about right angles to them—in fact simulating very closely the arrange-
ment of the skeleton of Chaling oculata, but without the keratose fibre Surrounding the
spicula of the skeleton in that sponge. In some of the species of this genus the symmetrical arrangement of the lines of the
8keleton is distinct only near the surface of the sponge, while in the more deeply seated
parts the irregular character of a Halichondria is 8imulated. Tn determining the
species of this genus, the sponge requires to be carefully examined by sections at right
angles to the surface, where the distinctive character rarely fails to be readily detected.
