2. When the black had reached the surface, but the yellow injection had hardly gone
so far, but had filled the network of slightly larger vessels close beneath it, many of these
lymphatic vessels contained a certain proportion of black mixed with their yellow
injection mass (Plate 88, fig. 22). The “ fine” vessels were completely black.

3. When neither the yellow (lymphatic) nor the “ fine ” vessel injection had reached
the superficial networks, or when the yellow had done so, but the black had not (Plate 88,
fig. 23), neither system was invaded by the injection of the other.

From this one can conclude that the connection between the two systems takes place
at or near the superficial capillary lymphatic network in the skin and mucous membranes,
and (from the fact that lymphatic injection did not invade the “ fine ” vessels) that the
flow of fluid takes place more readily from the “ fine ”’ vessels into the lymphatics, than
in the reverse direction. The actual connection might be expected to take place in one
of two ways; either insensibly by the gradual breaking up of the “ fine’ vessels to
form a capillary net common to them and the terminal branches of the lymphatics,
or abruptly by anastomosis with the lymphatic vessels or their terminal capillary
networks. The latter is what, I think, actually takes place.

In both Lophius and the Cod it is noticeable that the finer terminal branches of the
“fine ” system lying close to the surface of the skin or mucous membrane give off here
and there short and very slender branches transverse to their long axis (Plate 88,
fig. 24, cn.) These branches end upon neighbouring lymphatics and apparently open
into them.
