320 DR. KANE ON THE CHEMICAL HISTORY OF ARCHIL AND LITMUS;

In the production of this substance there are therefore two equiyalents of chlorine
directly added to the betaorceine, and the proportion of hydrogen proves that in this
case no replacement of hydrogen occurs. This is further shown by the fact, that in

_ the action of chlorine on pure orceine, there is produced a mere trace of hydrochloric
acid. The relation of the carbon and the nitrogen has been ass8umed as being unal-
tered by the action of the chlorine : this I have not directly proved completely; indeed,
for 8ome time I believed that a portion of the nitrogen was eliminated by the chlorine,
as 8al-ammoniac, but although the small quantity of orceine at my disposal prevented
me from fully ascertaining the relation to remain eighteen to one, yet in a trial which
I made it appeared $0 nearly that, that I believe it may be looked upon as sufficiently
determined to be made the basis of the formula. I therefore look upon chlororceine
as being Cj, Hj, N Og Cl,, and I consider the bodies
