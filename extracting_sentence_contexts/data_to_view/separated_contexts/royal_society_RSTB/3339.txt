Tn 1905, however, the second breeding season is specially emphasised ;' not only is
there a substantial advance on the increased birth-rate normally seen in Novemberâ€”
December, but there is an excess over that recorded for July ; thus the normal spring
breeding season was unusually boisterous that year. The exceptional fertility which
has already been noted for that year is no doubt due to the causes which induced
this specially vehement reproductive activity in March and April of the same year. My belief that this is exceptional is strengthened by the following facts. The
total births for the following year (1906) are considerably lower than for 1905,
though higher than for 1904, and yet the highest number of births during the period
when most children are born is markedly lower in 1906 than it is in 1904, especially
among illegitimate births. In the same way the lowest birth-rate in 1906, though it
is normally low in February, is abnormally low again in September.
