There does not appear, however, to
be any conceivable grounds for the admissibility of this very limited hypothesis, according
to the theory of central heat ; for though irregularities in the structure and conductivity
of the unstratified portion of the earth at such depths might produce considerable irre-
gularities in the forms of the deep isothermal surfaces, it is difficult to imagine the possi-
bility of any such relation as that above mentioned, between these irregularities of form

and the existence of snperficial sedimentary masses of lower conductivity. In fact, if the
form of the isothermal surface LM (fig. 3) were established before the formation of the
sedimentary mass AB, the tendency of that mass, when subsequently formed, would be
to reduce LM more nearly to parallelism with the external 8urface ; becanse the escape
of heat from M being greater than that from L, the effect would be to lower the surface
at M relatively to its position at LL. But if the hypothesis of the particular relation represented in fig. 3 between the
depression of the isothermal surface at I, and the existence of a sedimentary mass like
AB, directly above it, be deemed, as I conceive it must be, far 'too restricted to be
admissible, we must consider our hypothesis respecting the non-concentric form of
the deep isothermal surfaces independently of this additional restrictive hypothesis.
