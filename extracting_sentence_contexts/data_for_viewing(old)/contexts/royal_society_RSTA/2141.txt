in terms of minimizing risk (i.e. the KL-Divergence between predicted and a priori predictions of
outcomes in the future) and ambiguity (i.e. the expected uncertainty about particular states, given
external states of the world). We conclude by considering to what extent this anthropomorphic
interpretation is licensed by the underlying physics.


5. Discussion

In the above, we started from the simple, but fundamental, condition that a system must remain
separable from its environment for an appreciable length of time [31]. On unpacking this notion—
using concepts from information geometry and thermodynamics—we found that the states
internal to a Markov blanket look as if they perform variational Bayesian inference, optimizing
posterior beliefs about the external world. In fact, both active and internal states (on average)
minimize an upper bound on surprise. This means that Markov-blanketed systems make their
world less surprising in two ways. They change their beliefs to make them more consistent with
sensory data and change their sensory data to make them more consistent with their beliefs.

The sort of inference (or generalized synchrony [32,33]) we have described here is very simple,
where we have grouped all external states together. However, the broad distinction we have
drawn between internal and external states could be nuanced by subdividing the external states
into other systems with Markov blankets. From the perspective of the internal states, this leads to
a more interesting inference problem, with a more complex implicit generative model. It may be
that the distinction between the sorts of systems we generally think of as engaging in cognitive,
inferential, dynamics [34] and simpler systems [35] rests upon the level of sophistication of the
generative models that best describe their dynamics or gradient flows [36]. For example, if we
