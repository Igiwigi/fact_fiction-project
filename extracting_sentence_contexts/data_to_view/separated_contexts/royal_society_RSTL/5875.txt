Hence it appeared
t the influence of food is in two degrees: â€”lst, that which lies between those two lines
End exceeds the normal or basal line; and 2nd, that which sustains the system up to
e minimum or basal line. The former action is temporary and of short duration,
Fhilst the latter is permanent. S Proceeding from these facts, T have prosecuted a lengthened inquiry into the influence
F mamorow articles of food over the respiration, when taken separately and not in the
mbined form in which we take them at meals, and have endeavoured to ascertain
hat is their maximum effect. As nearly all food tends to sustain and increase the
tal actions, and as in the total absence of food for a lengthened period the respiratory
anges are sustained to the extent of 75 per cent. of that with food, my inquiries
have been almost entirely directed to determine that influence, which acts 80 as to
_ Ui between the maximum and minimum lines just mentioned. Except within very
row limits, T have not found any substance taken as food or with food which mate-
y lowers that minimum line; and, moreover, T do not know any method whereby
it would be possible, in a state of health, to show the action of any substance which
acts much below it.
