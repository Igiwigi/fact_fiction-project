way requires a long continuous time-series of met-ocean conditions, hindcast databases are the
best tool to describe the past wave climate. However, the propagation of hindcast databases to
shallow-water areas may have significant uncertainties. Firstly, there is the uncertainty related to
the ability of the nearshore numerical databases [14] to reproduce the past waves and sea-level
conditions. Secondly, there is the uncertainty related to the wave models for propagating wave
parameters from coastal scales to depth-limited areas. For these reasons, a probabilistic calibration
method using instrumental or satellite data should be applied to the long-term wave climate at
the nearshore position. Then, an appropriate model for solving the shallow water hydrodynamics
processes should be used.

In relation to the geometrical and structural variables of the breakwater (i.e. seaward slope or
mass density of the crown-wall), an adequate statistical characterization is also needed due to
the fact that limit state equations are also influenced by the uncertainties related to the resistance
variables. Generally, complex analyses are not possible due to the lack of data and statistics of
these variables. Although it could be improved by taking samples of the structural elements of
the analysed historic breakwater, this is out of the scope of most works. For these reasons, the
geometrical and structural parameters are usually defined by a normal distribution N ~ (1,0, =
tx x CV) and are assumed to remain constant throughout the whole lifetime.

(c) Hydraulic behaviour characterization

The third step is characterizing the hydraulic response of the historic coastal structure by means
of the L,, formulae.

In the field of port engineering, three different approaches are used to assess the m failure
