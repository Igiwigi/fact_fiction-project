In several of the other figured nebulz something has been discovered as to matters
of detail. In some we have found perhaps a few minute and apparently accidental
stars, in others a Jarger extent of nebulosity, and consequently a different form of
outline, but nothing of sufficient importance to make it desirable further to prolong
this paper. It appears to me, however, to be an important fact, that all we have seen
strongly confirms the accuracy of Sir Jonx Herscner's judgement in electing the
nebulz which he places in the class designated as resolvable. It is important from
its bearing on future researches ; for where the power of our instruments is insnfficient
Â«to do more than to bring to light distinctly the peculiar characteristics of resolvabi-
lity, these once observed with due caution and their reality ascertained beyond doubt,
we $shall conclude with little danger of error, that the object is really a cluster. We
should err, however, were we to assnme the converse of the proposition, that the
absence of all symptoms of resolyability was evidence conclusive that the object was
not a cluster.
