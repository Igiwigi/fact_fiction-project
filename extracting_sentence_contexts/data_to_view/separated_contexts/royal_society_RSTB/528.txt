SINGAULT points out, however, that in 1859, there was about twice as much nitrogen
taken up by a haricot growing in 100 grams of the soil, as by one growing in only
50 grams in 1858. It may be added that haricots took up much more nitrogen in
proportion to a given amount of soil than lupins. Referring to the main results, BousstNGAULT says the singular fact appears, that
the soil not only gained ammonia and nitrates, but organic matter also, possibly the
remains of living organisms. On careful examination, he has observed that vegetable
earth contains, not only dead organised matter, but living organisms, germs, the
vitality of which is suspended by drying, and re-established under favourable con-
ditions as to moisture and temperature. This mycodermic vegetation is not always
visible to the naked eye, and its progress must be followed by the aid of the micro-
scope.
