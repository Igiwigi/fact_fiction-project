value of Â¢ for the downcoming extraordinary wave. Similarly, in the neighbourhood
of the height where the electron density has the critical value NV, corresponding to the
point B in fig. 7, there is a stratum within which the ray theory ceases to describe the
propagation of the ordinary wave owing to the fact that the wave is in process of being
reflected. To describe what is actually happening within a reflecting stratum it is
necessary to obtain a more exact solution of the electromagnetic equations than that
upon which the ray theory is based. This has been done (Gans 1915; Hartree 19316)
under certain simplifying restrictions, and, so long as damping may be neglected, it
appears that, although the ray theory fails to describe even approximately what is
actually happening within a reflecting stratum, nevertheless it does give practically
the right expression for the reflected wave.

If the effect of damping is now taken into account, a complication arises from the fact
that the values of g corresponding to the upgoing and downcoming waves, being com-
plex, no longer attain actual equality, with the result that reflexion becomes partial
instead of total. So long as the difference between the two values of q decreases to a
value small compared with their rates of change per vacuum wave-length upon 27,
reflexion may still be considered total. But if the difference between the values of g
decreases only to a value comparable with their rates of change per vacuum wave-
length upon 2z, reflexion is only partial. If the effect of damping is so marked that
the value of q for the upgoing wave always differs from the value of q for a downcoming
wave by an amount large compared with their rates of change per vacuum wave-length
upon 27, no question of reflexion of the upgoing wave arises: it simply travels
