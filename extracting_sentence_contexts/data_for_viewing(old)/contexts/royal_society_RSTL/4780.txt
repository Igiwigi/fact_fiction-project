falls, the liquid still containing the rubian of the extract, as seen by its deep yellow
colour and bitter taste. If sulphuretted hydrogen be now passed through the filtered
liquid, a great part of the rubian goes down with the sulphuret of lead, and may
again be separated from it by means of boiling alcohol. That this action of the sul-
phurets on ruhian depends very much on their state of division, and is therefore
mainly of a mechanical, and not chemical nature, is proved by the fact, that the sul-
phurets of tin and lead, if prepared by precipitation from solations of salts in water,
and then allowed to settle and repose for some time before being added to a watery
extract of madder, remove far less rubian from it than they do, if they are formed in
the extract itself, whence it follows that it is only in the minute state of division, in
which they exist at the moment of precipitation, before the particles have time to
cohere, that these sulphurets exert any great attraction for rubian. That they do
however combine with some portion of the rubian is proved by the fact, that the
power of dyeing in an extract of madder is very much diminished by adding to it
sulphuret of tin or lead, previously precipitated. Of the two sulphurets, the sul-
phuret of tin, which is always precipitated in much finer particles than the other, is
by far the most powerful absorbent of rubian. If equivalent quantities of proto-
chloride of tin and acetate of lead be added to equal measures of watery extract of
