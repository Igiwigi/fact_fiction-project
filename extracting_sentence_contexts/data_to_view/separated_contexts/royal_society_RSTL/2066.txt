This explanation accords with the
apparently capricious nature of the fact; the circumstances
on which a direct or a retrograde motion depends are 80
numerous, and in the present state of our knowledge we have
so few data for calculating their influence, that it is not sur-
prising that the result of any given combination should be
uncertain. Besides the relative distances, we ought to be
acquainted with the relative conducting powers of the screen
and plate, —the intensity which can be excited in each by a
given inducing source—the quantity of that inducing action
which can be transmitted through the interstices of the
screen—the time each body takes to acquire and give up
electricity—before we can attempt accurately to predict the
result of any proposed arrangement. There is another circumstance in which the above expla-

nation agrees well with the observed facts ; since the motion
communicated to the needle is the difterence of two forces,
each of which is very small, it must itself be 'smaller than
either; and in case of any approach to equality in those
opposing forces, it will become exceedingly minute. With respect to the action of heat in encreasing these rota-
tions, I am inclined to conjecture, that the distribution of
electricity on the metallic plate is altered by the application
of heat; that the part under the needle becoming electrified,
produces in it induced electricity ; and thus the plate being
made to revolve, the rotation of the needle follows from the
explanation previously given. It may, however, happen,
that the wax needle becomes itself electric by the heat it re-
ceives from the plate below it.
