7. Two pairs of hypoglossal foramina.

Of these features, 1, 2, 6 and 7 are certainly to be regarded as primitive, and the
same is probably true of 3. The most striking fact when comparing the chondrocranium
of the rabbit with those of other mammals is, on the one hand, its dissimilarity to that
of the Insectivora (‘Tupaia, Erinaceus, Talpa, and Sorex). and on the other, its resem-
blance to that of the Primates.

None of the seven features enumerated above is present in the Insectivores, except
the ala hypochiasmatica in Erinaceus and the paracondylar process in Talpa, each
of which structures is reduced in these forms. On the other hand, features 3, 4, 5 and
6 are present in the Primates. These facts suggest the following conclusions :—

The possession of the seven features enumerated shows that the Rodents are a
primitive type, which diverged at an early date from the main stem of mammalian
descent. The absence of these features from the present-day Insectivores shows that
they have undergone specialisation and have departed considerably from the conditions
which presumably obtained in the primitive Insectivore type. The presence of four
of these features in the Primate is evidence of the primitive nature of that group. It
is probable, therefore, that the similarities between the chondrocrania of Rodents and
Primates are evidence of a general affinity between these groups at an early time in
the history of the Mammals, since when the Rodents have become specialised along
the line of mastication which is peculiar to them, while the Primates have perfected
their nervous system.
