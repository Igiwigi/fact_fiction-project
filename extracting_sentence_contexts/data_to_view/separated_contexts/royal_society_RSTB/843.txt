with the innervation of the well-developed muscles of this region, and may similarly
be described as a local development of a nerve-plexus connected with the musculature
of the cesophagus. Having thus established the fact that the inner ring is sensory
and the outer motor, can we proceed a step further and identify the two rings with
the two parts, anterior and posterior, of the typical ganglion? The connections of
the commissural portions, that is, those thicker portions which lie on the posterior
surface of the oesophagus stretched between the ganglionic enlargements on each
nerve cord, enable us to do this with certainty. The anterior and posterior com-
missures of the typical ganglion present, as we have seen, certain well-defined
structural characters.
