The design
flood will depend on the extent of change the three factors (rainfall depth, temporal pattern and
AMC) exhibit. While a 6-7% increase in the design depth with each degree rise in temperature
follows from the Clausiusâ€”Clapeyron relationship, increases above this have been observed for
sub-daily rainfall (see [12]). There are also locations where the observed day-to-day variability of
rainfall intensity to temperature is, in fact, negative [13,14], though the negative scaling appears
to be an aberration (see [15]) forced by the unusual relationship temperature change exhibits with
the occurrence of rainfall in tropical climates [16,17]. Observed increases in tropical precipitation
extremes [18] have been confirmed in such locations using a more suitable warming surrogate
