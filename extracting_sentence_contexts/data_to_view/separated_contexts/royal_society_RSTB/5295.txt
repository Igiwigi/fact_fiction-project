Hemicidaris intermedia. Calne does not come within the province of this paper, but this list of Echinoderms
is inserted in order to show that, palwontologically as well as lithologically, it is partially
isolated from our district. It is difficult to account for these facts, except by connecting
them with the analogous change which is observed in the Berkshire Oolites, and to
attribute the whole to the effects of the uplift of the Purton anticline. We find final
confirmation of these conclusions in a study of the Upper Caleareous Grit. (ce)
