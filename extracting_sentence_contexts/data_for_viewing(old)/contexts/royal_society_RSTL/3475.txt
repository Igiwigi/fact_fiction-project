DR. KANE ON THE CHEMICAL HISTORY OF ARCHIL AND LITMUS. 289

These numbers are confirmatory of the constitution of the substance as analysed
when uncombined, and hence the formula given above may be looked upon as well
established, although the number of analyses was limited to those above given, from
the very small quantity of the snbstance which I obtained in a sufficiently pure con-
dition. The connexion of this formula with that of the erythrine series is at once
s8een from the permanence of the twenty-two atoms of carbon which characterize
that group of bodies, among which the erythryline appears to be that from which the
azoerythrine is most directly and simply formed, in fact

One equivalent of erythryline . . . . . Cy Hy 0;
One equivalent of ammonia . . . . . TL ON
Sixteen equivalents of oxygen. ., . . . Oi;
One equiyalent of azoerythrine . . . . Cy, Hi, Oz, N.

To explain the formation of azoerythrine from amarythrine, which is the highest
member of the erythrine series by which we can consider it to be produced, we must
suppose three equivalents of water to become fixed in the substance, thus :

One equivalent of amarythrine . . . . Cz, Hz, O,,
