micromeres in the A quadrant asymmetrically, but soon takes up a symmetrical position
in the cleavage cavity, where it forms the larval adductor muscles. In Crepidula, it
has been found by ConKLIN arising from the second quartette in the quadrants A, B,
and C. In Annelids, it has been found by Esra (4) in Capitella, arising from a
portion of 4d; in Aricia from either the second or the third quartette; while
in Podarke, by TREADWELL (20), arising from descendants 3a, 3c, and 3d. In
Thalassema it arises from all the first three quartettes, and from all the quadrants,
which indicates its primitive character. In other words, as ConKLIN (2) has
remarked, the larval mesoblast is ancestral and might be called the “
distinction to the “secondary” mesoblast. It is not improbable, therefore, as
already mentioned, that it corresponds with the general mesoblastic tissue of
Platyhelminths, while the secondary mesoblast would correspond with the mesoderm
of the genital follicles of these forms. In fact, young larvee, such as that represented
in fig. 30, consist of ectoderm, endoderm, and larval mesenchyme, the definite
mesoderm being present only potentially, so to speak, as two cells in the anal region,
not different in any way from the other ectoderm cells among which they lie. As
the most primitive of mesodermic tissues, we should expect the larval mesoblast of
Annelids to possess the “ ancestral reminiscence,” as WILSON (24) has termed it, that
we find it does in reality possess. Its radial origin, in some cases arising from all
four quartettes as in Thalassema, its early appearance, and its distinct separation in
larval forms from the definite mesoderm, all amply testify this. We find, as we
