were an issue. The average of these lengths in inner units (Lt) is presented in figure 2 on log-
log axes, where the lighter (grey) symbols are outside the inertial domain. Clearly, (Lt) increases
with distance from the wall. In the inertial region, the average length increases approximately as
(Lt) ~ (yt)0-382, In fact, the power-law exponent is curiously close to 1/: @*, as indicated by the
solid line in the figure. We note that the power law has a range that seems to extend beyond
y/5 =0.15.

As an interesting aside, we note that the average lengths of u signal, both positive and negative,
have been investigated by Sreenivasan and co-workers (e.g. [21,22]). It turns out that the average
length is proportional to the Taylor microscale, and this is true for any random signal that obeys
a Gaussian probability density function. In the inertial region or log region of the turbulent
boundary layer, the Taylor microscale is proportional to (y+)'/. Figure 2 also shows a line of slope
1/2 (dashed) for comparison. Evidently, (Lt) follows a different scaling. In fact, it will be made
clear later (in figure 3) that the probability density function (PDF) of the uv signal is far from being
Gaussian, ruling out the expectation of a (y+)'/? scaling. Furthermore, we observe that the signal
spends a large portion of its time at values close to zero. This is likely to cause some uncertainty in
determining (Lt); however, the signals were obtained from two different experimental facilities
and both show highly similar behaviour.

The above discussion shows that, with close approximation, the negative time fraction
