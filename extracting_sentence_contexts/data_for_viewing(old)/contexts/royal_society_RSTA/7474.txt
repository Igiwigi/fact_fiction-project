aluminium, however, it can be seen that the curve for ~ = —4-8° is drastically different from
that for —0-8°. This very rapid variation of the behaviour with angle is even more strikingly
brought out in the bottom left-hand curve where the variation of couple with y for a fixed
field is shown; it can be seen that the region over which the couple increases proportionally
to siny cosy (i.e. to ¥ for the small angles concerned) is only about 1° wide, and it was
found that where the couple becomes small (e.g. for # = 2-5°) it is not merely that the
couple happens to be small for the particular field chosen, but that it is small at all fields.
It is rather as if the whole effect were modulated by a factor which passed through zero and
changed sign every few degrees. This complicated behaviour made the precise magnetic
determination of the orientation of the tetrad axis rather difficult, since the de Haas-van
Alphen amplitude vanished for several directions of the field within the possible uncer-
tainty of the direction of the tetrad axis as determined by the optical method. In each
series of measurements it was in fact necessary to measure a rotation curve such as that of
figure 16 and choose the origin of y in such a way that the curve for negative y was the
image of the curve for positive y after reflexion in both the axes of ordinates and abscissae.

Within the small region where the couple increases linearly with 7 the curves of C/H?
against 1/H have the usual sinusoidal form, but at larger angles complicated modulations
