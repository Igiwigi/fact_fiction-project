Where, as in Area granosa (fig. 3E) and Pectunculus glycimeris (tig. 11A, p. 201),
the filament is broad, the frontal cilia may extend round on to the sides of the
filament beyond the region where the latero-frontal cilia are usually located. A
similar disposition is figured by KeLoaa in Area pexata (42, fig. 66); but in the


GILLS OF THE LAMELLIBRANCHIA. 165

figures of Area barbata and Peetunculus glycimeris by Petseneer (71, figs. 36 and
34), the arrangement conforms with the normal plan. :

The non-ciliated interval between the latero-frontal and the lateral cilia appears
to be wanting in Solenomya (fig. 7 E, p. 192). The specimens examined in the
course of this investigation were not sufficiently well preserved to enable one to deny
its presence with any degree of confidence, although the cilia certainly seemed to be
continuous ; but it is a significant fact that in the figures given by Perseneer (71,
fig. 28), Kennoae (42, fig. 77), and Srempett (97, fig. 20) it is not shown. If this
be a correct conclusion, Solenomya stands alone as the sole example of a Lamelli-
branch with the frontal and lateral cilia continuous. Haren-Norman, it is true,
shows some small cilia occupying the interval between the lateral and the latero-
8 frontal cilia in Cardium ciliatum and Astarte sulcata (31, figs. 44 and 48), but,
although I have examined neither of these species, I have little hesitation in
regarding this as an error of observation.
