then e = Id'(a)W(a)da,

x, +2, = — $(a);
thus we arrive at the known general solution

y = x(a, + x), 2 = o(a, + 2).

whence, by elimination of 1,
(x2db + de)? (a db + de) + agtde’da = 0.
This equation must fail to define x, so that b, c, and a or ¢ must be constant ; thence it follows that all
four parameters must be constant.
I lay stress on this, because it is not in agreement with the results of Professor K6N1GSBERGER (‘ Crelle,’
vol. 109, p. 318), and appears in fact to show that his method there given is faulty. Professor KOn1as-
BERGER assumes (p. 313; I take m = 2) that the most general integral of the equations

Alm, Lay Ys % Pry Pry Qi, G2) = O

Pali %y Y, % Pry Py Vy G2) = O
Y = (tr, %, dil¥i(rr, %2)], a[¥o(a5 #2)])
2% = o(%, 2, filYr(e1, x2)], po[Yo(m, w2)]),

where ¢1, #2 denote arbitrary and y, Y2 definite functions. But suppose these equations solved for
dy, hy in the form
