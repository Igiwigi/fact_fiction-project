The sowing of March 29 (diagonal cross) increases this interval to six days, that of
April 5 to 11-12 days, and the last sowing of all gives a curve which rises a fortnight
later than that of the early sowings.

Tt will be noted that the last two sowings do not come into full flowering quite so
quickly as the others, this being shown by their curves rising less rapidly. Since the
sudden rise of these 1913 curves to an abnormal mode, before dropping back to the
normal horizontal maximum, was a special seasonal accident (p. 419), and since the
form of the flowering-curve is largely pre-determined by antecedent growth-processes,
it would seem reasonable to assume that these last two sowings had not developed
their flowering branches when the cause producing the abnormal mode was operative.

The fact that the sowing of March 15 is shown in these curves to flower slightly
yet definitely later than the sowing of March 8, will have some interest when we
come to consider the form of the curve which expresses the final yield (p. 438).

The Maximum Height of the Curve.—Neglecting until Part III the abnormal mode
which is shown in the week ending on July 18, we find a fairly horizontal maximum
in all the early and middle sowings during the month of August. We have delayed
consideration of this part of the curve, in comparing 1912 and 1913, to the “ Technical
Details” (p. 462). The evidence there presented seems to accord with the tentative
explanation which we gave in the spacing experiment to account for the existence of
this horizontal portion, namely, that the limit of available soil-salts had been reached.

It seems that we may extend this explanation to cover the present cases, for those
