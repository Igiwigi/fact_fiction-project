in the Barents Sea, estimated as 93g Cm? yr~! [8]. Complex oceanographic dynamics have a : BS
major influence on the Barents Sea PP. This is mostly driven by the inflow of nutrient-rich, 8
relatively warm Atlantic Water (AW) and its modification over the shelf through atmospheric : S
heat exchange. Furthermore, AW interacts with cold Arctic Water (ArW) giving rise to the Polar : &

Front (PF) along the Central and Great banks. Additionally, sea ice dynamics, marked by strong
seasonal and interannual variability, also play an important role in shaping OM productivity
patterns [9-14]. Such factors lead to an overall elevated PP in the AW-dominated southern shelf
(120 gC m7 yr~}), which is two-fold higher than PP of the northern shelf [7,8]. Spatio-temporal
PP patterns dictate OM vertical export and the quality of OM delivered to the seafloor [4,15,16],
which is reflected in benthic ecosystem structure [17,18]. Therefore, climate change-driven
perturbations to this Arctic system can lead to large, yet unquantified, disruptions of ecosystem
functioning in the Barents Sea. In fact, there is evidence of long-term summer sea ice retreat
[12,19], resulting in sea ice loss and an expansion of the seasonal ice zone [10]. Recent modification
of summer sea ice dynamics has been attributed to strengthening of AW inflow in the southern
Barents Sea region, forcing the PF towards the northern and north-eastern shelf, resulting in an
‘Atlantification’ of the northern Barents Sea [5,11,13]. In addition to sea ice retreat, disruption to
water column stratification and associated deepening of the mixed layer result in increased PP
due to enhanced nutrient recycling and replenishment, as well as longer duration of blooms [8].
Thus, PP patterns are likely to change significantly, modifying OM export and benthic ecosystem
structure [7]. If perturbations to Barents Sea oceanographic conditions persist, the present-day
southern shelf conditions might represent the future scenario of the northern shelf, and possibly
the wider Arctic Ocean [10,19,20]. In recent years (e.g. 2018), ice-free conditions have been
established over the entire Barents Sea shelf during summer months (Norwegian Meteorological
Institute, https: / /cryo.met.no/archive/ice-service /icecharts /quicklooks/2018/). This is critical,
