Much doubt then has centred around the possible alterations in the hydrogen-ion
concentration of the blood, and the extent to which they are responsible for a
physiological adaptation under discussion, ¢.e. the increase in total ventilation which
leads to an approximation in composition between the alveolar and expired airs. Tt was shown by one of us in Teneriffe(13) that the actual affinity of heemoglobin
in the body was the same, within the limits of experimental error, at 7,000 feet
altitude as at the sea-level. A few determinations seemed to show that the same
was true after a stay of a night at 11,000 feet, and this fact was subsequently
confirmed at Col d’Olen (15) (10,000 feet) and by the Pike’s Peak Expedition
of 1914 (4) at 14,000. In the latter case the length of residence before the
determinations were made was not specified. The most probable inference was
that, in the corpuscles at all events, the hydrogen-ion concentration remained
unaltered, and subsequent work has borne this view out to the extent that it has
been shown that small changes in the already large saline content of the blood do
not produce any appreciable change in the dissociation curve.
