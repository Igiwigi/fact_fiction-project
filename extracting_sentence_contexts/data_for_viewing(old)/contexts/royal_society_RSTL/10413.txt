Examples of the continued division of the segmentation nucleus before cleavage of
Sthe vitellus are very common, but in most cases the nuclei become far more numerous
Nbefore cleavage occurs than in the ovum of Renilla. In the case of the Isopod Asecllus
Z(Vax BEeNEDEN) the 8egmentation is entirely similar to one of the forms observed in
=Menilla, the nuclei multiplying to the number of eight, and the vitellus then dividing
Sat once into eight spheres. In view of the total dissimilarity of the adult forms, this
Wdentity in segmentation is a striking instance of the independence of the yolk-
Scleavage from the adult strueture; and it would be clear, from this case alone, that
-Sthe particular form of the s8egmentation may be wholly determined by secondary or
:Zadaptive causes.

E This fact is rendered especially conspicuous from the astonishing amount of variation
Shown in the Renilla 8egmentation. This variation concerns nob only 8mall details,
Sbut also features which are usually held to be characteristic of quite different types of
Edevelopment. Hence we can see how readily the form of segmentation might be
Eacted on by natural selection, for advantageous variations would certainly tend to be
#preserved and harmful ones destroyed. It must, however, be admitted that the
Saction of heredity appears to have little precision in this case, for the most unlike
Evariations appear in the eggs of the same parent, and I have not observed that any
Sparticular variation occurs more frequently in the eggs of particular individuals.
YZ We may now inquire, What is the direch cause of the variations in the
Syolk-cleavage? As we have seen, the nuclei divide, 80 far as can be determined,
in the ordinary course, and sooner or later the vitellus follows. It is highly
Aprobable that the division of the nuclei is in all cages nearly regular, and the
