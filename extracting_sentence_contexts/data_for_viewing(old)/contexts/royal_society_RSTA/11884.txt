xpansion of sulphur and aluminium imust lead either to the film separating from the
Aluminium or to both it and the aluminium being thrown into a state of strain. We
now that the plates remained firmly attached to the film, from a subsequent exami-
‘fion, and, consequently, we are driven to admit that heating strains both the film and
She plates. Now the coefficients of linear expansion as obtained from Sir W. THom-
pson’s ‘Collected Papers’ (vol. 3, p. 209), which numbers were taken from ‘“ CLARK’s
‘Constants of Nature,” are for sulphur, say, ‘000063, and for aluminium, 000022. To
pe quite satisfactory, of course, the linear expansion of this particular kind of sulphur
Bught to be observed, but the values given (mean of those of Fizzau and Kopp) are
caese not very far wrong.

It is probable that when the aluminium plates are heated they are quite free to
‘expand laterally and also vertically ; in fact, the gold dish is so weak and soft, it may
Ev set on one side, and the sulphur round the aluminium plates will, if anything, tend
Sto drag them outwards. We may assume, therefore, that when the condenser is

eated the aluminium plates increase in area, and are subject to some little stress,

hile the sulphur film increases freely in thickness, but is prevented, by sticking to

the plates, from expanding beyond their limits. The film being thin and weak,
compared to the plates, nearly the whole of the resulting strain is borne by it.

Consequently, any change in condenser capacity observed on heating will be due
either to the direct effect of temperature change in altering dimensions or dielectric
