For our present purpose
it will suffice to say that the line about which moments must be taken in order to
determine the bending effect produced by the pressure at the section coincides with the
ecntre of gravity of the section*®. As8wming that we know its position, and knowing

* It may be interesting to state here that Euizs's mistake respecting the action of this longitudinal pressure
arose from the fact that he considered the lower side of the keel as the © fulerum,”” as it was then termed, about
which moments should be taken. 442 MR. E. J. REED ON THE UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF

the amount and the line of action of the resultant fluid pressure, the determination of
the bending-moment due to it is very simple. I will now consider the cases of some actual ships, in order to give a more definite
idea of the amounts of the bending-moments due to the longitudinal pressure, and the
proportions they may bear to the bending-moments resulting from the action of vertical -
forces.
