1. Introduction

Group-living behaviour is assumed to occur when the benefits of living in a
group outweigh the costs. Numerous studies provide convincing evidence
of the benefits of group-living behaviour, including increased predator detec-
tion [1], increased survival [2-4], load-lightening [2,5], greater success at
territorial defence [6,7], stable pair bonds [8] and higher reproductive success
[9]. However, the majority of research on group-living focuses on intragroup
behaviours, despite the fact that in group-living species groups tend to be sur-
rounded by other groups and may regularly interact with them [6,10,11]. When
group-living brings benefits, group size relative to the size of neighbouring
groups may become an important determinant of group stability. Unsuccessful
breeding can cause a group to decrease in size through lack of recruitment to
the adult population, and this is of particular importance if neighbouring
