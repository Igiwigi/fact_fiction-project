If these results be conclusive against fluid being effused
into the pericardium after death in dogs, the conclusion from
them, admits of being extended by analogy to other cavities
of the same texture, and to man ; and I am not acquainted
with any pathological observations in opposition to it. The
discovery of serous effusions in examinations post mortem,
no symptoms of their occurrence or existence having been
noticed during life, is surely no evidence of their having taken
place after the cessation of vital action. It is too well known
to be insisted on, that large portions of fluid may accumu-
late in the pericardium, and even in the ventricles of the
brain, without a single symptom to indicate the fact.
