This result is based on the law that the rate is
proportional to the cube of the velocity. The Irish Sea is remarkable in that the
maximum current occurs nearly at high water, whereas in ordinary places the water
is nearly slack then; though other examples will be given later in this paper. This
affords the most favourable conditions for an accurate estimate of the rate at which
energy enters the sea; to this Tayior added the rate at which the moon’s attraction
does work on the sea, and from the fact that all this energy must be dissipated in
the course of a period (for if it were not, there would be a continual increase of energy
in the Irish Sea) he found that the mean rate of dissipation at spring tides was
6°0x 10" ergs per second. This estimate is probably more accurate than the other,
as the data involved are obtained from observations in St. George’s Channel, supple-
mented by an accurate theory ; but the former is based on an average of the velocities
in the Irish Sea itself, which are more difficult to determine.
