Oxygen, which is a typical gas
for every difficulty in spectroscopy, is a case in point. Oxygen seems to have two
perfectly distineb line spectra, each of which generally appears by itself and unmixed
with a trace of the other spectrum. Let us for a moment consider how we may explain these facts without having
recourse to molecular combinations. We huve to assume that, when the vibrations of
a molecule are mall, they take place in a series of periods, and consequently show
lines in the spectroscope at places corresponding to these periods. Now imagine the
temperature to be raised.
