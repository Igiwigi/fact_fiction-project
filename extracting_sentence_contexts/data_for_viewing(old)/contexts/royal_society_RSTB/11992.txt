Figure 1. A display of mammalian TENTs. The display summarizes major facts about 11 mammalian TENTs. The enzymes fall within two major classes: poly(A)
polymerases (highlighted in green) and poly(U) polymerases (highlighted in yellow and pink). Their homologues can be further grouped into seven families based
on their phylogenetic conservation (separated by dashed lines and/or coloured background). The display states protein names according to currently recommended
terminology, the multiple aliases, protein molecular weights (in kDa) and number of amino acids within the canonical isoform (after uniprot.org), activities and
targeted RNA types. Additionally, a cartoon representation of each protein (or a consensus representation for the TENTS proteins) is provided with indicated domains
that are colour-coded and labelled as follows (in alphabetical order): KA-1—kinase associated domain (in TENT1), MTS—rmitochondria targeting signal/peptide,
NLS—nuclear localization signal, NTr—catalytic nucleotidyltransferase domain (or an inactive domain), PAP-associated domain, Pneumo G and atrophin-like
domains in TUT4, RRM—RNA recognition motif, ZNF—zinc finger domain of either C2H2 or CCHC types. snRNA, small nuclear RNA.
