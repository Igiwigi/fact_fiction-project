electromagnetism and the nuclear forces are based on conserved quanta. Gravity is also by far
the weakest force. A direct consequence of this is that the energy at which all the forces have
comparable strength is close to the so-called Planck scale which is some 15 orders of magnitude
higher than the energies currently being explored by the Large Hadron Collider. This fact calls
into question the validity of the standard model of particle physics, as it is thought that this
theory cannot be stable in the presence of such an immense fundamental energy scale. On the
other hand, our confidence in Newtonian and Einsteinian gravity comes from carefully controlled
experiments. The universality of free fall is an empirical foundation of Einstein’s theory of gravity
and states that the free acceleration of matter in a gravitational field does not depend on its
chemical composition. Laboratory tests of the universality of free fall [2] and Newton's inverse
square law on the scale of less than 1m [3] use the same measuring devices and techniques as
those used in determinations of G, as we describe further below. However, in order to perform
the most sensitive tests and to relieve the burden of metrology, these experiments are cleverly
designed to give a substantial signal only if nature misbehaves in the way sought out by the
experimentalists. In determinations of G, we actually have to measure all relevant quantities in
physical units and attack the metrology head on.
