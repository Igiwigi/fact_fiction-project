Saucted in the same manner as those for the * Victoria and Albert,” and the results are
Srepresented by the curves shown on fig. 4. It is necessary to remark that in these
Erexxels there is an armoured upper-deck battery amidships above the central main-deck
<battery, and that there is neither a bow nor a stern battery protected by armour, as the
Sfore-and-aft, fire, s0 essential in ironclads, is obtained with the central battery guns on
Sthe upper deck. By this means nearly all the principal weights are brought towards
Sthe middle of the length, and the extremities are much less heavily burdened than in
Smost other ironclads, not excluding even ships like the © Bellerophon.” In short, the

present case is one of a ship with weights very unusually concentrated at the centre.
A'The curve H H of weight of hull in this case bears a certain resemblance to that of the
© Bellerophon * in fig. 3, only the cusps P, P are more pronounced on account of the
armoured bulk-heads of the upper-deck battery. This fact also accounts in part for the
difference between the curves of total weight W W for the two ships. It is only neces-
sary to add that the length of the © Audacious * is 280 feet, and that the same scales
have been used for lengths and weights in fig. 4 as in the preceding diagrams. 'The
distribution of weight and buoyancy for this ship may be summarized as follows :—
On the 35 feet of length between the bow and the foremost balanced section (R' in fig. 4)
