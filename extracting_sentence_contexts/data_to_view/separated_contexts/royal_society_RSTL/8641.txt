The membrana of the coiled tubes is exactly similar to that of the ducts of the tubes
or that of L1EBERKUnNN'S glands. I must leave to another paper any complete description of fat-absorption in the
stomach, only observing that in sucking animals the epithelium covering the surface is
seen apparently completely filled with fat. This fact was noticed by Brucn (102) and
KG6LLIKER (103), In fully developed animals no fat can be observed in the epithelium
covering the surfaces of the plice villos; but the epithelium of the ducts and of the
coiled tubes appears cloudy with fat, and this is much marked in animals whose stomachs
contain bile. It is not intended by the foregoing remarks to give any opinion as to the
method of fat-absorption in the stomach. The occurrence of lymphoid follicles in the mucosa will be discussed in the next
chapter.
