with the Weyl scaling equation (2.13), we get a transformation that leaves the metric fixed. So if : =
general covariance is a valid symmetry, then the ‘dimensional analysis’ re-scalings considered in : a
high-energy and condensed matter physics are equivalent to constant Weyl transformations. 12

In modern physics local Wey] transformations, though interesting, do not appear to be a good aes
candidate to provide new fundamental symmetries, or new gauge interactions. There are major 22
barriers to supposing that local-scale invariance holds in Nature. As we already observed, scale : re
invariance would forbid basic properties we seem to need, like particle masses. That difficulty DN
might not be insuperable, as we have become accustomed to exploiting hidden (spontaneously : =z
broken) symmetries of equations that are not manifest in their stable solutions. More difficult :&

to finesse, it seems, is the fact that local-scale symmetry is in tension with the basic structure of
interacting quantum field theory, due to the need for renormalization—running of couplings. This
effect brings in distance dependence, even when the underlying classical theory is scale invariant.

Remarkably, that difficulty may well prove to be a blessing in disguise. For there are situations
where that quantum effect, running of the couplings, is the main correction to scale symmetry.
Then we can gain insight from an appropriately corrected version of scale symmetry. In the
remainder of this lecture, I will indicate how pursuing that line of thought enables us to quantify
and refine an attractive proposal for the unification of force and substance.
