Anatomical connections between the mPFC and the amyg-
dala have been implicated in the mechanisms that mediate
stress-related mental illnesses in humans as well as in traditional
animal models of stress and learning [37,38,42]. To determine
whether these anatomical connections were likewise necessary
for the stress effects on learning, we conducted a classic discon-
nection study, similar to that developed by Holland [43]. The
method is based on the fact that most (but not all) regions in
the rodent brain are connected to one another only on one side
of the brain. By lesioning one structure on contralateral sides
of the brain, the connections between those structures are dis-
rupted on both sides of the brain (figure 3a,b). As a control
procedure, each structure is lesioned on the same side of the
brain, thereby only disrupting the connection on one side of
the brain while inflicting the same amount of lesion.
