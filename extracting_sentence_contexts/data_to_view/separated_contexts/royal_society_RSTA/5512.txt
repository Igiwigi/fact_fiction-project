From experience and characterization of a multitude of spinning polymers, the complex :s
viscosity should be in a region of 100 Pas-500 Pas for a good processibility. This is reached for the [&

used lignin in a temperature region from 180°C to 187°C, which is a really small process window. With regard to the fact, that a temperature deviation of 8°C was measured within industrial
spinning heads [56], this could lead to an uncontrollable viscosity profile from 500 Pas to 1700 Pas
(asm. 180°C is the highest temperature) to 25 Pas—100 Pas (asm. 187°C is the lowest temperature). In the first case, due to the high viscosities, brittle fractures below the spinneret will occur. In the
second case, due to the low viscosities, the formation of droplets will occur [41].
