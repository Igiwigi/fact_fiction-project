The
formula y/100 = Ka"/(1+K2") fits the known curves, and therefore provides a useful
method of notation, but the assumption that represents the mean number of
molecules in a clump is hypothesis. SuMMARY.

1, Although there is a marked fall in the CO, pressure at high altitudes the blood
does not become pleonectic. This fact is due to an acidosis, the specific nature of which
has not been completely discovered at altitudes below 10,000 feet, though it is in
part a lactic acidosis, but above 10,000 feet is largely a lactic acidosis. It is probable
that the acidosis which takes place below 10,000 feet is less due to any acid abnormal
in kind than to a fresh adjustment of the usual acid and basic radicals. This
readjustment is probably set up by the kidney.
