We hope that this review paper on FFST will remind readers of what is now in our toolbox,
help in the development of the platform, and entertain those interested in non-trivial scaling
properties in the dynamics of physical systems.

2. Basic concept

An important procedure in FFST is to look for a viable state of the system during the speed
control, taking into account physical constraints. This resembles the fact that our running form
changes with speed. As you may notice, our body is not simply moving faster when we run
faster (figure 1b). It is because that we are in the air for a certain period of time after kicking off
the ground, and fall at a constant acceleration due to the gravity no matter what speed we are
moving horizontally.
