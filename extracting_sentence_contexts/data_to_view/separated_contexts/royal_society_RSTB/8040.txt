Justification for the topology of this tree and its being correctly rooted and thus historically
correct is elsewhere (Cavalier-Smith 2006a,c; Valas & Bourne 2009). A widespread contrary view that the root is between eubac-
teria and neomura stems from protein paralogue trees with long-branch topological artifacts and ignoring palaeontological
evidence that negibacteria are immensely older than eukaryotes. For simplicity, the fact that the nucleus (N) has a double
envelope that is part of a pervasive endomembrane system is not shown. The ancestral eukaryote is shown with a single
cilium and centriole, but both had probably doubled in number prior to the earliest divergence among extant eukaryotes
(Cavalier-Smith submitted 5).

2006a,b). By failing to recognize this, most who where the root of the tree really is within the immen-
discuss the last common ancestor of all life have sely diverse eubacteria before deducing the ancestral
reached entirely incorrect conclusions about its phenotype.
