If is the horizontal component of acceleration, # = ka, where k gal/cm.
is a constant of the apparatus, and the second-order correction dg is #?/2g. Assuming that
each peak is sinusoidal, a? = 4a2, and dg = k?4a2,/2g; hence

A(g) = KA(az) /4g = Ke (az,/N)4/2g. For a typical acceleration recorder record, N = 360, k = 9:81, (a2,)* = 0-4 and Â¢ may be taken
as --0.1 cm., to allow not only for errors in measuring the amplitude but also for the fact
that individual peaks are neither truly sinusoidal in form nor of equal duration. This gives
6g=7-8 mgals and A(dg) =0-146 mgal. If we assume that the two horizontal components
are independent, then the error in the resultant will be the square root of the sum of the
squares of the errors in the individual components.
