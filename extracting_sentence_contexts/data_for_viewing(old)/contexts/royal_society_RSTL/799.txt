acquires that texture, which fits it, when extravasated in
living animals, to open a communication with the general
circulation, and by that means become a part of the solids of
the animal.

It has ever been a desideratum to ascertain in what manner
blood after it had coagulated, and remained at rest in different
parts of a living animal, is rendered vascular. The fact itself has
long been known to every enquirer into the operations of the
animal economy, and several theories have been formed to ex-
plain it. Mr. HunTER, who perhaps understood theappearances
such coagula put on, when injected from the neighbouring
vessels, better than any other physiologist, was unable to
trace a direct continuation of ramifying branches from the
circumference of the living parts to the centre of the coagu-
lum, and therefore referred it to a principle of life existing in
the blood, which principle was consequently inherent in the
coagulum, and formed a series of vessels, pervading every
part of it, which opened for themselves communications with
the surrounding vessels. Since Mr. HunTER's time, no more
