HANSON ON THE SHADOW OF A STRAIGHT EDGE 57

the displacements of the medium are everywhere small. But when an edge is sharp
the solution may make the displacements at the edge infinite, so that the above assump-
tion is broken. It is only due to the fact that these infinite displacements are confined to
points very close to the edge that the theory, in its application, is but little affected. Medium Mo

the electric force in the incident wave, which is supposed to be plane, is parallel to
the edge.
