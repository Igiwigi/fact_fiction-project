Measurements based on the sensitiveness
would not therefore be trustworthy if, upon the comparatively simple changes of form
assumed in the calculation of that quantity, other and more complex variations were
8uperposed, We have therefore investigated the form of a film consisting of two
parts of different surface tensions, assuming that it does not differ much from a
cylinder,

If the surface tensions are T and T+dT, the generating curve of the film may be
regarded as consisting of two parts, PR and RQ, which produce unduloidal surfaces
of different curvatures. The conditions which these curves must satisfy are as follows —

(1.) If X, and XN, are the differences of the abscisxw of R and P, and Q and R,

respectively, then X; and X, may be considered as constants which are given

by the conditions of the problem.

(2.) The values of the ordinates which correspond to P and Q must both be Y.

(3.) The ordinate of R(=y) must be the same for both curves.

© (4.) The tangent at R mus be the same for both curves.

(5.) The sum of the volumes of the two unduloids contained between the rings may
be taken as given.

(6.) The pressures exerted by the two parts of the film on the enclosed air must be

1 the same. A These eight conditions may be used to determine the eight unknowns, viz., de,, dÞ,,
Jt, 4B, $, and þ,, the values of $ which correspond to P and Q, and , and yþ,, the
ues of 4 which correspond to BR, considered as belonging in the firs case to PR,

&d in the second to RQ.

& The discontinuity at BR is dependent on the fact that in the cylinder the value of þ
