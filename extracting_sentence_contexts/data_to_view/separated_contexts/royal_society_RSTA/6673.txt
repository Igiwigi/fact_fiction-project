SOUTHWELL AND G. VAISEY ON RELAXATION

From the membrane analogue it is clear that

(1) the boundary of the wake will have a horizontal tangent (i.e. a cusp) where it joins
the line of symmetry ;*

(2) the specified gradient q may not exceed some limiting value; for otherwise the edge-
loading will eventually carry the broken-line boundaries past the points (F, F, figure 29)
at which q, has its largest value, and then no solution will be obtained. It appears (cf.
figure 28) that in fact the limiting ‘free’ boundary leaves the cylinder at F, F;

(3) the wake will extend to infinity when the ‘wake pressure’ is atmospheric. For then
the gradient q is correct far downstream, so that there the imposed edge-loading will be
sustained: elsewhere qq will be too small, so the edge loading will depress the whole line of —
symmetry.

48. Method (B) was actually used in this manner to start the computations for some of |
the cases summarized in figure 28, but all were completed by Method (A).
