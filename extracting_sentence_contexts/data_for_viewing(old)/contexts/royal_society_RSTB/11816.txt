These findings contrast with some results obtained in pre-
vious theoretical studies. In a model of haploid, facultatively
parthenogenetic organisms in which only resistance could
evolve, Gerber & Kokko [37] found that intense conflict
under high densities favoured sex because accepting multiple
matings was less costly for females than resisting them. Our
findings suggest an alternative pattern: in our model, parthe-
nogenesis proliferated in highly productive, densely
populated habitats—even when resistance was costly—
because larger numbers of coercive males generated stronger
selection on females to resist, and high productivity allowed
resistance and parthenogenesis to spread together. These
differences may reflect the fact that we modelled sexual con-
flict as a reduction in female fitness as mating number
increased over 1, whereas Gerber & Kokko’s model assumed
no costs of mating, only costs of resistance [37]. Thus, the
nature of sexual antagonism could be important in determining
outcomes of alternative reproductive modes.

The extent to which sexual conflict drives female bias in
facultatively parthenogenetic populations is currently unclear
because of a lack of data on sexual conflict in such systems.
Nevertheless, our model suggests three preconditions that
are jointly sufficient for sexual conflict to generate and
maintain geographical patterns of reproductive mode in facul-
