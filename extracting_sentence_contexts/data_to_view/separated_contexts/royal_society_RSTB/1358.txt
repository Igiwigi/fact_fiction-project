Pouiton has shown that among butterflies the
Vanessidx excrete uric acid under like circumstances. I have myself observed that
e yellow Pieride also void uric acid immediately after they leave the chrysalis, and
it is a point of great interest to note that this is associated with a yellow pigment,
most certainly the same as that found in the wings.* I have obtained clear
§. lepidoporphyrin reactions from the yellow material so voided. The fact is thus
= emphasized that the substances used in ornament are the true excretory products of
q ‘the animal.

_ The nature of the process whereby these products reach the wing-scales can only
| he ascertained by a careful study of pupal development. I have myself repeatedly
observed that the scales are fully developed anatomically before the pigments
‘appear in them. No murexide or lepidoporphyrin reactions can be obtained from the
{ embryo wings until the perfect insect is close upon emergence, not, I believe, much
before the time when similar excretory products have begun to accumulate in the
m.
