In the food of Sheep
(and of oxen also), the proportion of s0-called © woody fibre” is very much greater than in
that of Pigs. With the former, therefore, there will be a larger proportion of indigestible

matter voided than with the latter ; and, as will presently be seen, with the larger pro
portion of digestible or assimilable matter in the food of the fattening Pig, there is at
the same time a less proportion of the consumed dry substance expired, perspired, or
voided. At the head of the other results in Table XV. are given the amounts of the main
classes of constituents stored up in increase for 100 of collective dry matter in food 1
the case of the analysed <© fat Pig.” From the cireumstances under which the data were
obtained in this particular instance, it may be assumed that the figures exCce' i
closely represent the actual facts. The indication is that, for 100 of dry matter of
