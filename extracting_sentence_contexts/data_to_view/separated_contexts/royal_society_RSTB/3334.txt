The proportion of F. born in towns is very
considerably higher than is experienced in the provinces (Tables XI, XII), and this is
true for whites as well as coloured, and is evident, as a rule, in legitimate and
illegitimate birth records. A suggestion is made as to the causes, associated with the metabolic activity of the
mother, which bring about this result, but it is not claimed to be a fully adequate
explanation. The fact, however, remains, and this is a third example of the exercise of
extraneous forces on the proportion of the sexes produced and, so far as I can see, of
the failure of any theory of heredity to account therefor. Thus this investigation shows that extraneous forces may influence the proportion
of the sexes produced, and it is clear that the hereditary tendency of any race or
species to produce the sexes in certain proportion may be radically interfered with by
a great variety of circumstances. In dealing with human beings living under civilised conditions, such interference
can only be comparatively slight, and the comparatively small differences recorded
under some headings of this paper may be judged by some to be inconclusive. â€” I
think, however, it cannot be denied that the main points of difference I have set forth
are so consistently exhibited for both the white and coloured races in Cuba, and the
variations in the proportion of the sexes produced are so intimately associated with
factors which undoubtedly affect the metabolic activity of the women, that they must
be accepted as valid evidence of the fact that physical, and especially nutritive,
conditions do affect the ratio of the sexes of offspring, and may override the
hereditary tendency of the race in this respect.
