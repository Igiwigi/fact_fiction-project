In the case of the relatively high figure + 0°0046 which stands
amongst internal readings, it is to be noted that the corresponding external readings
were also higher than usual,

Apex of Right Ventricle.—From this region there are six readings (—0°0013,
—0°0041, 0:0008, —0-0003, 0:0031 and 0:0029). The readings are of similar order to
those of the central region. Despite this fact, the epicardial surface of the apical
region reads higher than that of the central region ; this is to be accounted for by the
greater thickness of muscle beneath the former. The Base of the Right Ventricle.—There are nine readings from this region
(—0°0023, 0:0032, —0°0005, —0-0022, —0°'0016, 0°0009, 0:0138, 0°0018, —0°0001)
and two from an area between this and the central region (—0°0022 and —0°0025). The base readings are higher than those of the central region, but not so high as
might have been anticipated from the distribution of the Purkinje system to this
region.
