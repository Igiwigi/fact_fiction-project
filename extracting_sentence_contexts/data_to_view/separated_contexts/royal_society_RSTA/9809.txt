The results of these experiments are interesting, in that they show—

(1) The breaking of drops of water is accompanied by the production of both positive
and negative ions.*
(2) That three times as many negative ions as positive ions are released. The difference between the negative and positive charges produced should correspond
to the charge remaining in the water. Now, it has been shown above that 55 x10“
els. unit of positive electricity is retained by the water of each drop after breaking,
and this amount agrees as well as could be expected with the 2°2x10-* els. unit
per drop found in the air; the difference is no doubt due to the fact that many of the

* This experiment does not indicate the nature of the ions produced : for instance, the positive ions

might be exceedingly fine water drops. Still it shows that something of the nature of ordinary ionisation
takes place and that the ions exist long enough to be separated by the Ebert instrument. RAIN AND ITS ORIGIN IN THUNDERSTORMS. 405

tions given to the air at the splashing of the water are not drawn into the Eber
instrument, but give up their charges to the sides of the apparatus.
