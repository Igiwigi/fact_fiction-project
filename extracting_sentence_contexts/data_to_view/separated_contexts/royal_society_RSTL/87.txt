To this end,
I took young ones, the Moment they came from the
Parent, which was alone in a Glaſs; or I even parted
them with Sciffars: Each of theſe young ones I
put into perfect Solitude, T fed them every one
{cparately in a Glaſs ; they all multiplied, nor only

themſelves, but alſo their Offsprings, which from
Generation to Generation, as far as the Seventh,
were all confined to Solitude with the ſame Precau-
tion,

Another Fa, which I have obſerycd, has proved
to me, that they have the Faculty of multiplying, be-
fore they are ſeycred from their Parent, 1 have ſeen

+ @ Polypus, till adhering, bring forth young ones;
S and thoſe young ones themſelyes have allo brought
» forth others. Upon Suppoſition, that perhaps there
2 was ſome Copulation between the Parent and young
S ones, whilft they were yet united; or between the
S young ones coming from the Body of the ſame Parent;
Z I made diyers Experiments, to be ſurc of the Fact; = but nor one of thoſe Experiments eyer led me to any
Z thing that could give the Idea of a Copulation. = The - Polypus multiplies more or leſs, as he is

Warm.
