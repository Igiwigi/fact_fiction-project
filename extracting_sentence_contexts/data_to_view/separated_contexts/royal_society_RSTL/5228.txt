Reviewing the whole of the cases which have fallen under my observation in
which indigo has become deyeloped in the urine, there is every reason to believe that
the occurrence of that snbstance in the urine is strictly pathological : that it is 80
when in large amount, no doubt whatever can be entertained. Looking to the
composition of indigo, there is als no doubt that, like bile and urine pigments,
it forms a vehicle for the elimination of carbon from the system ; and since it
contains a much larger proportion of carbon than either hazmatin, urine or bile
pigments, we should be led to look for its occurrence in the urine in all those cases
of functional derangement of any kind in which any impediment exists tro decarboni-
zation, as is the case especially in most diseases of the organs of respiration. From the facts which I have already succeeded in ascertaining, there is good
reason for believing that the above view is, in the main, correct. Turning to the
history of the three cases of blue urine which first attracted my attention, I find
that one died phthisical ; the second, thongh living, has undoubtedly tubercular
disease of the lungs, with greatly diminished capacity of respiration ; while in the
third case there have been evidences, although less marked, of lung affection. Again, turning to the histories of the twenty cases in which samples of urine were
st aside for observation, and in four of which samples indigo became developed in
considerable quantity, I find that these were also cases of phthisis.
