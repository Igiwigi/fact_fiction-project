nitric acid was pure, and of specific gravity 1:48. Both strong and weak solution
of potassa gave the same order. The yellow sulphuret of potassium consisted of one
volume of strong solation (1812.) and five volumes of water. The metals are num-
bered in the order which they presented in the dilute acids (the negative above), for
the purpose of showing, by the comparison of these numbers in the other columns, the
striking departures there, from this, the most. generally assumed order. Iron is in-
cluded, but only-in its ordinary state; its place in nitric acid being given as that
which it possesses on its first immersion, not that which it afterwards acquires.

consequent on dilution (2005.) ; and thus show that there is no general ruling in-

conductors, apart from their pure chemical relations. But how can the contact
theory account for these results > To meet such facts it must be bent about in. the
