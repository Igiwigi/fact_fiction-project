aquatic Tnvertebrata. The investing bones of the face may be grafted on such
cartilages, but the two things are quite different in their nature. The condition of the
visceral arches in this type, both in the larya and in the adult, has led me to
reconsider the whole question of the nature of these arches.

There are several things to be considered at the ontset, before a comparison is made
of the skeleton of the throat, the branchial skeleton, and the skeleton of the chest.
The post-auditory part of the cranium has manifestly undergone secular shortening,
0 that the pharyngeal or ventral region belonging to it often extends under the twice-
seqmented 8pine, whose fore part is, 80 to speak, intercalary or 8uperadded, and does nob
correspond with the arches beneath it, which often extend backwards for some distance.

At one time this appeared to me to be an explanation of the fact that the inner
(or proper) branchial arches of Fishes are developed beneath the fore part of the spine
and the hind part of the basis cranii, whilst the mandibular and hyoid arches, the first
and second of the branchial category, often fix themselves to the basal plates of the
cranium.

I now strongly suspect this view of the matter to have been a mistaken one ; and
that it is the abnormal 8ize and gpecial modification of the mandibular and hyoid
arches that make it necessary for those arches to seize hold of swinging points above
their normal dorsal region or apex.

T think that the figures IT have given of the visceral arches in the larval Sterleb
(Plate 13, figs. 6 and 11) will make my meaning plain, Here only one arch is
