April
is on the west side of the mean line at the Cape at all hours without exception, and
at St. Helena at all hours with the exception of 11 a.m. and noon. I abstain from dwelling on other particulars, fearing that, not possessing any
clue towards an explanation of these remarkable phenomena, I may do harm rather
than good by contributing to give an undue significance to what may not prove the
most important features. I will only permit myself therefore to point out one or two
practical considerations snggested by the facts now under notice. 1. Recent researches in meteorology have shown us, that when we confine our
attention to the mean annual and mean diurnal values (of the temperature for example)
in different parts of the globe, we derive but a small part of the instruction which the
observation of nature is eapable of affording.
