Two forms of thread-cells may be
distinguished,—one oviform (fig. 4, «, a'), with the invaginated sheath occupying the
axis; the other fusiform (fig. 4, 6, 0), with a slightly curved axis, and having the invagi-
nated sheath oblique. Both kinds of thread-cells are formed in the interior of certain
cells belonging to the superficial layer of the ectoderm, and may be seen, some lying
2 free among the true cells of this layer, others enclosed in their generating-cells, and
either completely immersed in the granular matter of the cell or surrounded by a large
clear vacuole (fig. 5). No facts, however, have come to my knowledge tending to throw
2 further light on the mode of origin of the thread-cells. The deep layer of the cellular ectoderm (fig. 2, h) is formed by a very remarkable tissue,
to which I shall refer under the designation of the claviform tisxue. This is composed
of cells consisting of a yellowish granular protoplasm, entirely destitute of membrane,
and each drawn out into a long caudal process.
