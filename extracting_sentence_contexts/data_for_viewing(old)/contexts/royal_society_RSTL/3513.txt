chemical theory, it was natural to expect that it would also produce some corre-
sponding change in the voltaic pile. The effects observed by Avocapro and CErsTBD
in 1823 are in accordance with such an expectation, for they found- that when the
8ame pair of metals was plunged in succession into a'strong and a dilute acid, in
certain cases an invyersion of the current took place*. In 1828 De 1a Rivs carried
these and similar cases much further, especially in yoltaic combinations of copper and
iron with lead4. In 1827 BecquertLy experimented with one metal, copper, plunged
at its two extremities into a s0lution of the same 8ubstance (alt) of different strengths ;
and in 1828 Ds La Rive\ made many such experiments with one metal and a fluid
in different states of dilution, which I think of very great importance.

1970. The argument derivable from effects of this kind appeared to me 80 strong
that I worked out the facts to some extent, and think the general results well worthy
of statement. Dilution is the cireumstance which most generally exalts the existing
action, but how such a cireumstance should increase the electromotive force of mere
contact did not seem evident to me, without assuming, as before (1874.), exactly those
influences at the points of contact in the various cases, which the prior results,
ascertained by experiments, would require.

1971. The form of apparatus used was the bent tube already described (1915.)
fig. 7. The precautions before directed with the wires, tube, &c., were here likewise
needful. But there were others also requisite, consequent upon the current produced
by combination of water with acid, an effect which has been described long since by
Becquese. ||, but whose influence in the present researches requires explanation.
