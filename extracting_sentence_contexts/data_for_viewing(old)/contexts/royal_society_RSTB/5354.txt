H Two significant facts come to light:â€”(q) pairs of seams, widely separated from one
another, show dominance of fern and fernlike plants or dry flora, and (6) pairs of seams,
close together, show dominance of the Lycopodiales or wet flora.

3 Fauna.

a Faunal remains on the whole are somewhat rare, and of the different genera, Car-

oh honicola, Anthracomya and Naiadites are sometimes very rare. At other times they

ES appear in well-defined bands, but how far such bands extend laterally is not known.

5 A significant fact is that on horizons where plants of the class Lycopodiales are
5 dominant, shell bands generally occur. Further, the shales in such bands are of a
2 carbonaceous nature. Possibly swampy lagoons with brackish water conditions would
2 have a disastrous effect on the Mollusca, owing to the poisoning of the waters. (lHydro-

= carbons due to decaying vegetation would have strongly impregnated the sluggish
waters.) Fresh-water shells exist under such conditions to-day.

. The soft black sediments themselves would be covered with dead vegetable tissue,

5 with the result that the Mollusca would perish on the spot. The shells appear in all

= stages of growth in the black shales. Every slab of shale is covered with their remains
