The contention of Davis that Micuaux’s plant represents
a very distinct species is inadmissible, although it would evidently rank as a variety
of O. Lamarckiana, distinguished from the strain of pz Vrirs by certain well-marked
differences. It is highly probable that wherever this strain of Micuavux grew wild,
the strain represented by the O. Lamarckiana of pz Vries would not be far distant
geographically. The present genetic survey has brought out the fact that seeds of O. Lamarckiana
agreeing with the English garden strain, which differs slightly in colouring and
crinkling from that of pe Vrigs’s cultures, have not infrequently been introduced
into private gardens in Eastern Canada, from whence they have sometimes escaped
more or less successfully. In company with Professor Marte-Vicrorin in 1932,
we found at Lotbiniére, above Quebec on the south side of the St. Lawrence, a small
group of plants of this species growing on the edge of a field by the roadside. They
were probably a recent escape from a.garden in the neighbourhood and they showed
no definite signs of spreading.
