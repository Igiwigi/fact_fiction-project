nator, where indeed the same causes, viz. the shadows of

mountains, will, no doubt, at times occasion an uneven, ragged
appearance, but cannot materially affect the very faint light
of the whole.

It is, moreover, evident, that even when the extremities of
the cusps are, as in fig. 1, not darkened by shadows, the faint
luminous points fg, þ 7, are not always visible, but can only

* The perpendicular height of these mountains, as I have already shewn in a former
work, is in proportion to the diameter of the planet, at least as great as the height of
the mountains in the moon, in proportion to its much $horter diameter ; this fact I
have had frequent opportunities to ascertain, See Selenotop. Fragm. $. 522.

and calm, and a good telescope with a large aperture, and high
magnifying power, is used in the observation. And it follows
that, except under those circumstances, the parts of the cusps
af, c þ, must, on account of their great sharpness, be the ap-
parent and sufficiently luminous extremities ; since, according
to well known principles, the exterior points a, and c will
