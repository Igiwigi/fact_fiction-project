Fig. 36. (Ovis 66.) Age 20 days. Stained with hemalum, thionin, orange G.
A section taken near the centre of a cotyledon, showing very clearly the
conspicuous character of the diplocaryocytes. Most of the ordinary
trophoblast cells, which have nuclei which show very little chromatin,
have their cytoplasm filled with long bodies stained yellow, probably of
proteid nature. x 400.

Fig. 37. (Ovis 12.) Age 52 days. A section taken longitudinally through the
middle of the cotyledonary area. The stroma cells are darker in colour
and are lined by a very irregular layer of trophoblast cells. In the
middle is a section through one of the villi taken close to the surface so
that only the epithelium is cut through. The diplocaryocytes are recog-
nised by the more deeply staining quality cf their nuclei, and by the fact
that the protoplasm is drawn away from the general surrounding tissue.

â€˜Fig. 38. (Ovis 12.) Age 52 days. A highly magnified section through the base of
one of the crypts showing the plasmodium formed by the trophoblast cells ;
the strands, processes of protoplasm, are seen to be in direct connection
with the cells of the stroma. x 900.

Fig. 39. (Ovis 65.) Age full term. A section taken vertically through the inner
part of a cotyledonary area showing the interlocking of the foetal and
