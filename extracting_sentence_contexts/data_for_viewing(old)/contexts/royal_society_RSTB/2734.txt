Tn such a case the cells of the outer layer have spherical nuclei, which are of the type
found in secretory cells, while the cell-substance shows basophil staining, and, in a
few cases, asmall number of eosinophil granules. Such an appearance, I believe,
represents the early stage of reconstruction of an alveolus from the islet. Fully
formed and loaded alveoli are often seen, which yet appear to be included in the islet
outline. An instance of this is to be seen near the upper border of the specimen in
fig. 9. In spite of much searching, however, I have not been able to trace a series of
intermediate stages in the formation of such an alveolus.

Two other points in the histology of the resting pancreas of the toad are deserving
of mention and further investigation. The first, which has some relation to the
appearance just described, is the fact that the alveoli immediately surrounding such a
“resting” islet are more fully loaded with secretory granules than those in the rest
of the gland. This was noticed by JArorsky in the mammal, and by him attributed
to the formation of a prezymogen by the islets. I have also noticed it in the resting
dog’s pancreas, but the difference in the toad is far more striking. These fully loaded
alveoli are not always seen surrounding the islet on every side. At one point the
islet may be growing, by the breaking down into islet tissue of an imperfectly loaded
alveolus, while on its other sides it may be surrounded by the fully loaded alveoli,
which, by their concentric disposition round the islet, give the impression of having
formerly formed part of it. Another process, of which the significance is not quite clear,
is generally to be seen at some point of the resting pancreas of the toad. This is a
vigorous nuclear multiplication, giving, under a low power, the appearance of a
localised infiltration with round cells. When seen under a high power, this is seen
