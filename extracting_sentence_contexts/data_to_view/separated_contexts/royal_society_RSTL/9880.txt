In virtue of the greater radius of the coil, this important advantage was
obtained without undue increase of the correction for magnetic moment, which
amounted to about 004, only twice as great as before. The effect of mechanical
disturbances, such as air currents, was still further reduced by diminishing the size of
the mirror, particularly in its horizontal dimension. On both accounts the influence
of air currents was probably lessened about 15 times, and, in fact, no marked disturbance
was now caused by the proximity of a lamp to the magnet box.* In consequence of
these changes, however, it was found necessary to introduce an inertia ring in order to
> bring the time of vibration up to the amount (about 5% seconds from rest to rest) neces-
8ary for convenient observation, The diameter of the ring was about # inch, and the
whole weight of the suspended parts was not too great to be borne eagily by a single
fibre of silk. A brass wire passing between the spokes of the ring prevented the needle
from making a complete revolution.
