Fig. 8.—The liquidus curve of the system copper-aluminium.

As one of us has shown,* there is considerable evidence that aluminium is univalent
in the crystal of the element, and we suggest that this very small depression of freezing
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the molten alloy is also univalent. There
is, however, considerable evidence (see p. 37) that the aluminium is trivalent in solid
solution in copper. If this be so, we have a case involving an equilibrium between
different states of the same atom, and a simple relation is not to be expected. Examina-
tion shows that the binary copper-aluminium curve cannot be made to fit the standard
equivalent composition curve by means of an arbitrary factor. The ternary system
copper-aluminium-tin has been investigated in great detail by Srockpauyz,} whilst
the system copper-zinc-aluminium has been studied by Carpenter and Epwarps{
