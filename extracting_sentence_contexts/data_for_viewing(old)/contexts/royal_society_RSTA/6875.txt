the whole of the specified loading, so were multiplied by an appropriate factor (e.g.
0-958 in the case of figure 19). Similar multiplication was introduced about half-way
through the liquidation process summarized in figure 20. In that diagram both the
starting and the final (i.e. accepted) values of w are recorded, together with the loadings
for which they account. (The specified loading per nodal point, multiplied as above,
is 15-26.) The accuracy is such that greater residual forces would result from a unit
change in the last digit of any displacement.

“MATHEMATICAL Prostiem II.’ AN EXTENSIONAL EXAMPLE

35. Our last example concerns extensional stresses due to specified edge tensions,
a problem of the class to which photo-elastic methods are most commonly applied (§ 1).
It has in fact been so treated by Coker and Filon (1931, § 7-06).

Figure 21 records the dimensions of the B.S.I. standard ‘briquette’ for the testing
of cement, with an indication (shaded) of the ‘jaws’ by which tensile loading is applied.
The waisted form is intended to ensure fracture across the minimum section, and (on
the ground that in this neighbourhood the boundary is not stressed) a definite stress-
system is assumed to obtain at the waist, notwithstanding that the applied tractions are
not known with great precision. Uncertainty is introduced (1) by friction accom-
panying the wedging action on the jaws, due to which the applied tractions may have
