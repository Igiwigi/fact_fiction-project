immediate effect has been horrible distortion of the face by the prevalence of
the muscles of the opposite side, but without the loss of sensibility ; and that
distortion is unhappily increased when a pleasurable emotion should be re-
flected in the countenance.

These facts are 80 distinct, that I cannot presume to detain the Society with
the instances of the lesser defects which I have witnessed from the more partial
injuries or temporary diseases of the nerve ;â€”such as distortion of the features
produced by glands pressing on this nerve, paralysis from suppurations in the
ear affecting the nerve in its passage, or temporary derangement disturbing
one or more of its functions.

As to the fifth nerve, the facts are equally impressive, and correspond with
our former experiments and opinions. By a small sacculated tumour affecting
the roots of this nerve, the sensibility was destroyed in all the parts supplied
by its widely extended branches ; that is, in all the side of the head and face
and the side of the tongue, whilst the motion of the face remained. Two cir-
cumstances affecting this nerve have occurred with most curious coincidence
in the symptoms. By the drawing of a tooth from the lower jaw, the nerve
which comes out upon the chin to supply one half of the lip was injured, and
exactly this half of the lip was rendered insensible. When the patient put
his mouth to a tumbler he thought they had given him a broken glass !
Precisely the same thing occurred from the division of that branch of the fifth
nerve, which goes to one half of the upper lip. A gentleman falling, a sharp
point entered his cheek and divided the infra orbitary nerve: the effect was
