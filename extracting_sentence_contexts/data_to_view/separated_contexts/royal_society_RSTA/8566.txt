Chem.,’ 1907, vol. 57, pp. 583-556) that when sodium hydroxide is
added, the specific rotation of the salt assumes a large negative value, probably because
“in the alkaline solution an antimony alkali tartrate is present, in which the hydrogen
atoms of the alcoholic hydroxyl groups are also displaced.”

Our own experiments give no support to Kreckn’s view that tartar emetic obeys
Bror’s law. Thus the first preliminary series of observations gave for the product
[M]? values which increased progressively from 156-17 at wave-length 6708 to 203-85
at wave-length 3917. But a “ simple ” dispersion formula [M] = 140-67/(\*—0-0477),
based upon the readings for the two dominant mercury lines, showed an agreement that
was very satisfactory, especially in view of the fact that the observed rotations had been
multiplied by nearly 12 to convert them into molecular rotations. Moreover, the
