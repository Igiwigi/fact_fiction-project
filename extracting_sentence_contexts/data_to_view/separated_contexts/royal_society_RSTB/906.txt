AND BEHAVIOUR OF THE WANDERING CELLS OF THE FROG. 283

‘od a Mammal has only one kind of wandering cell. These facts suggest two
5: firstly, that a certain fixity of type must be accorded to each kind of
ering cell, that the different forms found in the more complex animals must be
arded as distinct from one another in their development and life history, even if
y be regarded as having a common origin ; and, secondly, that, corresponding with
s divergence and fixity of type, there must be divergence and fixity of function.
have endeavoured to demonstrate a disparity of function comparable to the
parity of form by comparing the behaviour of the different kinds of wandering
s towards various substances when added to the lymph or blood. Zince the wandering cells of the Frog retain their vitality for a long time after

emoval from the body, that animal has been mostly used. The lymph is obviously

serviceable for examination, but the cells of the blood are similar and offer

ar phenomena.
