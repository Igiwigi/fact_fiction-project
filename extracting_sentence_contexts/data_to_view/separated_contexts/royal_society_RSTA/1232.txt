is large; (10) is, in fact, an asymptotic expansion. The values of I,/H, derived from observation (§ 2.4) indicate* that, if » = 1, 8 must
be about 8\/p, while if » > 1, « and % must be increased nearly in the ratio yw: 1.
Computations were made for the two harmonics P,! and P,*, and values of » from 1
to 100 were considered.t
