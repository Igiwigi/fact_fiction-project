A few drops of solution of corrosive sublimate were mixed in a cup of tea
sweetened with sugar and cream. About a teaspoonful was put into the pla-
tina crucible, with nearly an equal bulk of muriatic acid. A slip of zinc being
applied for about a minute, a greyish substance was found at the bottom of the
crucible, which, when washed, dried, and heated, afforded metallic mercury.
These experiments were repeated with success, both in the platina crucible and
in the platina gilt crucible ; and precisely similar results were obtained with
coffee, under like treatment.

It is proper to remark, that the experiments noticed in this section, were, in
general, carried on only for a few minutes, s0 that the decompositions were
mostly partial, and probably in-no instance complete. This statement is con-
firmed by facts, for I repeatedly found that after a given effect had taken place
in the platina' crucible in a few minutes, a still further effect was s00n pro-
duced, by transferring the same materials to the platina gilt crucible.

When a solution of corrosive sublimate (in small quantity) was added to
some s$herry or port wine in a platina crucible, and the zinc applied, a beau-
tiful effect gradually took place. In the course of about a quarter of an hour,
calomel was formed, and deposited at the bottom of the crucible in snccessive
