I give publicity to the facts which prove that horrible distortion of the whole
countenance, the loss of distinct articulation, the loss of expression, the loss
of motion of the eyelids, and consequent inflammation of the eye, must follow
such an operation. .

Much has been said in favour of experiments when made by men who are
positively without any expectation of the result, or, as they affirm, are unbiassed.
The only instances of this that I can allow, are when the surgeon cuts the
nerves of the face in a surgical operation. In s8uch operations as these for tic
douloureux;, he is indeed unbiassed ; and we have seen the result, that after fifty
years of such experience we remained quite ignorant of the distinctions in
these nerves. But on the other hand when attention is roused to inquiry by
aantomy, facts are obtained of the utmost importance both to the knowledge
of disease and to the safe practice of surgery.

Of the Motor or Manducatory portion of the Fifth Nerve.

The fifth nerye is usually called Trigeminus, from piercing the skull in three
grand divisions. But when it has been shown that it is composed of two
distinct roots having different functions, the accidental circumstance of its
divisions passing through the bones yields in importance to another inquiry,
How is the muscular portion of the nerve distributed ?

Since the publication of my first paper this inquiry has assumed importance ;
although the principal facts of the anatomy were known to WRrisBERG, SAN
