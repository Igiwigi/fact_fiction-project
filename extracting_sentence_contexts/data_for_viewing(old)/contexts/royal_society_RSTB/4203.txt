AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE KINETONUCLEUS IN THE BINUCLEATA. 385

The process of syngamy is almost identical with that in [elkesimastix. Stages in
it have been previously seen but regarded as representing division. Thus Kent's
fig. 20, Plate 14 (after Srern), and Wenyon’s text-figs. 1 and 4 (Joe. cit.) showing
forms with doubled flagella, really represent conjugation. A very great help in
distinguishing between individuals undergoing fission and those undergoing syngamy
(union), which from my long observations on these coprozoic flagellates will prove, I
believe, of general application in such cases, is the fact that division is a very short
process, whereas conjugation is a very long one. Moreover, in division, the body
practically ceases to displace itself, only undergoing little jerky movements where, or
S50 long as, the flagella persist. In all the forms which I have studied, division is
g usually a matter of only 15-20 minutes at the outside. In Cercomonas, the
