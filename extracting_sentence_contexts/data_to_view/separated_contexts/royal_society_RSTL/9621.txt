Yet when specimens
80 mutilated are inverted, one out of every four specimens is able to right itself. This,
however, is only done with great difficulty and after a long time, 80 that, under these
circumstances, the execution of this manceuvre seems to be just barely possible. Still
the fact of its being possible at all proves that the integrity of the nerve-centre is not
absolutely essential to its performance. Therefore, as experiment has failed to reveal
to us any other general nerve-centre in the animal, and as even a segment of the
animal containing only a single row of pedicels is in many cases able to perform this
mancenvre, we conclude, as already stated, that the action of the pedicels is partly of
a serial character, though largely assisted by the co-ordinating influence that emanates
from the nerve-centre. The effect of this operation upon the spines and pedicellarize still remains to be
considered.
