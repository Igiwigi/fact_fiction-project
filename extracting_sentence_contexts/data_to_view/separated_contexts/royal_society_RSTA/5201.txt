at a temperature close to 10°C. In the experiments at low pressures it was, of
course, essential that the firing tube should be absolutely gas-tight; the tube was
therefore tested before each experiment. An important fact concerning the develop-
ment of the explosion-wave was detected in these experiments. As the pressure was
reduced the flame was found to travel a greater distance before its rate became con-
stant ; so that, although four feet start was allowed before the first measurement was
taken, this distance was found insufficient. Accordingly a tube 20 feet long was
interposed between the firing point and the first bridge, after it had been shown that
& the flame acquired its maximum velocity in this distance under the lowest pressure
“used.
