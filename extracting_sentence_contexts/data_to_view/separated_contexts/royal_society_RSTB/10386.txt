1. Introduction

The term ‘statistical learning’ was initially used to describe the fact that infants are
sensitive to the probability with which syllables co-occur, and can use this prop-
erty to segment words from fluent speech [1,2]. In this original set of experiments,
the probability of co-occurrence between syllables was described in terms of ‘tran-
sitional probability’, which is defined as the frequency with which syllables X and
Y co-occur, relative to the frequency with which X occurs. That is, if the syllable X
occurs 100 times, and the conjunction of XY occurs 80 times, the transitional prob-
ability between X and Y is 80%.
