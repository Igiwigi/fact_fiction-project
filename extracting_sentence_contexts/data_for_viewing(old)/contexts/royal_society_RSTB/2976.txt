somewhat oblique end-walls (fig. 21, p.c.w.). A conspicuous feature of this layer is
the relatively great radial thickness of the cells, especially in the lower region of the
pollen-chamber, where their tangential walls often project as convex papillee (figs. 19
and 24). Distally the layer thins out considerably, and in the region of the neck,
where it is in close contact with the canopy, it has almost a membraneous thinness
and is usually much darkened by carbonisation (figs. 19 and 21).

The contour of the chamber varies in different sections according to their plane.
The only really longitudinal section, that shown in W, 1931 A. (see phot. 2 and fig. 24),
shows it to have been rather truncate in form like a water bottle.

‘The pear-shaped form seen in U. C. L., R.1 (fig. 19), and the still more tapering
outline in U. C. L., R.2 (phot. 8 and fig. 21), both depend on the fact that these
sections are oblique (cf. text-fig. 1, where the planes of section are plotted). The
former cuts the base of the pollen-chamber midway between the centre and the
periphery, whilst the latter follows a plane parallel to and close within the sloping
wall, which it intersects just above the level of the insertion of the pollen-chamber
upon the plinth.

A still more oblique section is shown by the Manchester specimen, K,. 14257
(fig. 29). This intersects the base at an angle of 45° and then travels out of the
pollen-chamber about half-way up the sloping wall. The bevelling of the wall is
excellently shown in this specimen. Yet another oblique section of the pollen-
chamber is shown in a specimen from the Kipsron Collection, No. 260 (fig. 22).
