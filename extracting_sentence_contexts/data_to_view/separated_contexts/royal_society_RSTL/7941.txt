the fourth power of e being neglected—a formula which may be applied without sen-
sible error to any orifice of an approximately circular form. In fact for a given area the
circle is the figure which gives a minimum value to c, and in the neighbourhood of the
minimum the variation is slow. Next, consider the case of two circular orifices, If sufficiently far apart they act
