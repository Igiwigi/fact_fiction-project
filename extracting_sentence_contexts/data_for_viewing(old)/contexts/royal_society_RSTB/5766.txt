3) The final mother-liquors on evaporation gave an alcohol-soluble tar weighing 24-8 gm.
“ from which further quantities of citromycetin could be extracted by dissolving it
© in alcohol and precipitating with a large volume of ether.

a (b) The tarry matter may also be separated somewhat less thoroughly by taking
= advantage of the fact that it is more soluble in 50 per cent. aqueous alcohol than is
£  citromycetin. This method can only be applied efficiently, however, if the proportion
+ of tar in the crude citromycetin is not high. With very impure specimens of crude
3 citromycetin, the whole product is soluble in small amounts of aqueous alcohol and,
£ for purification, is better treated by method (a). Method (6) is carried out as follows :—
2 A quantity of crude citromycetin is ground in a mortar with sufficient hot 50 per
S cent. aqueous alcohol to convert it into a thin paste. This is then quickly filtered on
a Buchner funnel and washed with small quantities of the same solvent. he filtrate
is brownish black in colour while the colour of the insoluble material is changed from
the original dark brown to a much lighter yellowish brown. If the colour of the pro-
duct is not satisfactory it is again extracted by grinding with hot aqueous alcohol.
Finally, it is recrystallised several times from 50 per cent. aqueous alcohol, from
which it separates quickly, on cooling, in yellow needles.
