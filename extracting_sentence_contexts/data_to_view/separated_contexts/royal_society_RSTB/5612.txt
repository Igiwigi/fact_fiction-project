Albinism in this snail is also, as usual, a simple mendelian recessive, and is inherited
directly ; an albino fertilised by a pigmented produces pigmented young in F,, and
F, consists of broods each of which contain pigmented and albinos in the proportion of
3to1. The characteristic shell shape of an Irish lake form of the species also disappears
in F, on crossing with a normal specimen.

4. It is suggested that the delay in the inheritance of sinistrality is due to the fact
that the twist of the animal and its shell is determined at the first division of the egg. Pigmentation and shell shape, on the other hand, are not fixed till a later period in
development, and the spermatozoon would have more time to bring its influence to
bear.

5. This simple scheme of inheritance is a good deal interfered with by a general
tendency for dextrals to appear where sinistrals would be expected.

(a) Genotypic dextrals, breeding true (* dextral break-throughs”’) arise not un-
commonly in sinistral lines: dextral broods with a few sinistrals (“‘ F broods ’’)
represent the same mutation in an incomplete form.

(b) Phenotypic dextrals often appear in sinistral broods (‘‘E broods”’’) and may
constitute up to half the brood.
