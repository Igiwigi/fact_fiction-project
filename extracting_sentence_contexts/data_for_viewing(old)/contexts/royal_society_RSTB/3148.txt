For instance, in fig. 4b, he shows the protoplasm of the solenocyte drawn away from
the tube itself, which stands out as a stiff hyaline cylinder; exactly the same thing
is shown by Goopricu in his figures of the solenocytes of Nepthys scolopendroides
(7, Part 2, fig. 27, Plate 9). This hyaline nature of the solenocyte tube I have
never been able to observe in P. newpolitanus, but doubtless it is the same hére also,
for, in preserved material, the tubes are the parts of the solenocytes that are best
preserved, and this points to their being composed of some firm substance, for the
protoplasmic heads can seldom be seen in sections or preserved preparations, being
extremely perishable and delicate. Thus, the solenocytes of the Polygordius larva,
with the exception that each does not possess a separate nucleus, are essentially the
same in structure with those of other Annelids. In a recent paper, JANowsky (10)
has examined the nephridia, and has confirmed a number of the above-mentioned
facts concerning their structure.

8. The Structure of the Head-kidney in the Free-swimming Larva.

Before considering the early development and gastrulation, it may add clearness to
the foregoing remarks to give a brief résumé of the anatomical structure of the head-
kidney in the free-swimming larva. It can readily be divided into three portions :
the canal portion, the head portion, and the web-like funnel portion bearing the
solenocytes. Of these, the canal portion is the largest, and is composed of an intra-
cellular tube opening on the exterior on the lower larval hemisphere. This opening
is difficult to see on account of its slit-like nature, which allows it to be kept closed,
and so almost invisible. In the Neapolitan larva, its position, however, can be
determined by the presence of a small amount of pigment in the ectoderm, which
