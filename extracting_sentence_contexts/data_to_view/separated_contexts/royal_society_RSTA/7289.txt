* ‘The argument involved considering how fully the atmosphere in these regions could possibly be ionized,
bearing in mind the fact that pulse echoes are not observed from above the F, layer, and then calculating as
a function of the assumed temperature the dispersion which such a distribution of ionization would produce. Full account was taken of the effect of diffusion in limiting the degree of ionization at high levels, and of the
variation with height of the acceleration of gravity and the magnetic field strength. AN INVESTIGATION OF WHISTLING ATMOSPHERICS 139

Office for their co-operation in the work of locating the sources of the atmospheric clicks
which gave rise to whistlers, and to Mr P.
