We suspect, without proof, that such a form of benevolence
lies at the basis of the most remarkable successes of machine-learning and modern artificial
intelligence applications. But this cannot be assumed to be the universal rule: a big red light is there in general, the name
of the game being ‘overfitting’, that is a stiff solution exists which reproduces very well a given set


Figure 3. Examples of three classes of landscapes that may be encountered in connecting input to output variables, shown
in three dimensions but typically, in fact, arising in much higher dimensions which cannot be drawn. (a) A relatively smooth
(i.e. continuous) landscape over which machine-learning algorithms might be expected to perform well; (b) a fractal landscape
which is not differentiable and contains structure on all length scales; (c) another discontinuous landscape with no gradients. Neither (b,c) would be expected to perform reliably in the context of machine-learning algorithms. Reproduced from Coveney
etal. [7].

of data, but fails grossly as soon as the dataset is enlarged, if only slightly.
