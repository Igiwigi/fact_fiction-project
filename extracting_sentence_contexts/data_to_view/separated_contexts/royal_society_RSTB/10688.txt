Some CCCs had a community liaison
officer whose job was to encourage people in the surrounding
area to attend them when they were sick. Thankfully, the stat-
istical models proved unreliable and the worst case scenario
did not occur. In fact, the general curve of the epidemic
declined before many CCCs opened, meaning that it was
rare that they admitted Ebola patients, though they did
triage suspect cases and, in some cases, treat other illnesses. This meant one of the biggest tests of community engage-
ment—how people would interpret rising caseloads in their
locale—did not materialize. As documented by Oosterhoff et al. [48], the community
engagement processes around the CCCs found that people
simultaneously appreciated and resented the CCCs.
