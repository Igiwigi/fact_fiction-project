Linearized models are prone to be analytically solved, as done by
Hunt and co-workers to describe the flow over low hills [7] and over forested areas [8]. These
analyses led to the development of commercial software such as WAsP and FUGA [9]. Despite
the fact that wind turbines can be described as body forces distributed over the rotor disc (similar
to the actuator-disc method), and that the work of Belcher et al. [8] could be apparently applied
to a distribution of wind turbines, no analytical model has been proposed for the flow over wind
farms. The key assumption of the analytical solutions of the linearized equations relies on the scale
separation between a lower layer, described by a parabolic equation (where the pressure gradient
is constant in the wall-normal direction), and an elliptic region above it, where the pressure field is
determined as a response to the body force. According to the model assumptions, the pressure at
the bottom of this upper layer will then be imposed over the lower layer.
