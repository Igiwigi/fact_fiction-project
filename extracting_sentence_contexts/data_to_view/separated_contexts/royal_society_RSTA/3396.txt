This arrangement corresponds to two features of Sonnas’ description of the Earth’s
surface. The nearly symmetrical breaking at three places of the belt and three of
the ring, which he also noticed, indicates the presence of the sectorial harmonic of the
third degree. If we refer to the polar axis, instead of any other morphological axis,
the presence of the zonal harmonic of the third degree is indicated by the existence
of an Antarctic continent, and by the fact that most of the land of the globe is north
of the Equator. The harmonic of the third degree and second rank, referred to the
polar axis, vanishes at the Equator and at four meridians symmetrically placed. If
this term were the only one, then, in two northern quadrants there would be land,
and also in the two alternate southern quadrants, an arrangement which suggests
Central Asia and North America as the land quadrants of the northern hemisphere,
Australia and South America as those of the southern.
