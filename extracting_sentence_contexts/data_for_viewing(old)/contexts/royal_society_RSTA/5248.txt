dynamics in the lower stratosphere. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the catalytic
chemistry is highly sensitive not only to aerosol surface area density (SAD), but also to
water vapour [13]. Elevated levels of lower stratospheric water vapour constitute an additional
uncertainty and risk factor for ozone and SRM.

(a) Catalytic chemistry

In 1994, it was demonstrated by direct in situ observations of the rate-limiting radicals by
Wennberg et al. [14] that chemical ozone loss in the lower stratosphere is dominated by
catalytic removal through reactions with the hydrogenâ€”oxygen (HO) radicals OH and HO). This
represented a major turning point in our understanding of ozone loss from the previously held
view that the catalytic loss of ozone was rate limited by NO, radicals, specifically NO and NO} in
the lower stratosphere. In fact, because HO, radicals are the dominant rate-limiting radicals in this


system, and because reactions with NO; radicals are the dominant reactive pathways converting
the rate-limiting HO,, ClO, (CIO and Cl) and BrOx (BrO and Br) radicals to their non-catalytic
inorganic forms, the NO, radicals become the buffering species rather than the catalytic species
in ozone removal. As a result, with a decreasing concentration of NO, species, the rate of ozone
catalytic loss in the lower stratosphere increases, because the rate-limiting radicals HO2, ClO and
BrO that are removed by NOx increase in concentration.

Large ozone losses that occur over the polar regions result directly from heterogeneous
reactions involving inorganic chlorine [15]. These reactions serve primarily to transform inorganic
chlorine (principally HCl and CIONO) that constitute approx. 97% of available inorganic
