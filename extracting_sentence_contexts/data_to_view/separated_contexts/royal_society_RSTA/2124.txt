Three explanations seem to me to be possible :

(1) The current of air may not be fast enough to prevent an extra loss caused by
diffusion to the sulphuric acid. (It is to be noted that when no air passes, about
0Â°03 gr. of water diffuses in the time usually taken for an experiment.) This
hypothesis is ruled out by the fact that in an experiment with water in 3, 4 and the
first two branches at 5 (the other two containing sulphuric acid), 4 still showed the
usual loss in weight. (2) Remembering that the vapour is practically all absorbed in the first branch
of 5, it seemed possible that the sudden drop in pressure caused by this absorption

* It is only with apparatus D, where the deposition of water in the quartz joining tubes is very small,
that we have been able to put two water vessels in series.
