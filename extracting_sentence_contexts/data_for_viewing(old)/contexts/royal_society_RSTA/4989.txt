We have

on V x Fp, where, for all i, Aj is an irreducible representation of the group G which is also a sub-
representation of the representation std?" ® D(Std;)®" of G?, with Std; denoting the natural faithful
representation of G? corresponding to 1*F;.

In fact, for G given as above, we have

U-generous, then there is equality, and the converse also holds. : 5
In general, if § is given by (2.3), then there exists a character x of G/G° such that : 5

Clearly, the case n = (0,...,0) recovers theorem 2.7. Dy
Proof. This is the same as that of theorem 2.7, mutatis mutandis. a : s
