The largest “character” figure for the five days 107 to 111 occurred on day 111
in group (A) and day 110 in group (B), but on day 107 in groups (C) and (D) ; while
the lowest figure occurred on day 108 in group (A), and on day 111 in groups (C)
and (D). Considering this variability, much weight cannot be attached to details in
the results for the fourth associated subsequent pulse. The fact, however, that the
figures for all five days 107 to 111 are so decidedly in excess of the normal seems
clear evidence that this pulse is by no means negligible. The primary pulse in Table V. shows the two characteristics noted in the discussion
of fig. 2.
