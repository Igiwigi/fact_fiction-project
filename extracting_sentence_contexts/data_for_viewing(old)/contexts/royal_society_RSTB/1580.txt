After the removal of the inmer tunic, and tle exposure of the tunica externa, the free

the anterior chamber ear its anterior extremity and » little to the onter side of the

consequently more rigid than the tunica interna; it is, in fact, entirely owing to the
thickness and strength of the former coat, combined with its more or less exterisive
