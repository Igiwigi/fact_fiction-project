This line of research began with Ashurst & Hoover [13], and
moved onto massively parallel computers through Abraham eft al. [14]. While computers became
more and more powerful over time and seemed to make the need for analytical understanding
obsolete, it proved surprisingly easy to be misled by the solutions that came from seemingly
obvious choices about initial conditions and boundary conditions. For example, because of lattice
trapping, it was possible to think that certain loading conditions made crack motion impossible,
when in fact the stationary crack was only a metastable solution. Many cracks were driven in
simulation by boundaries made to move apart at rates that were far to fast ever to be realized
in experiment. Therefore, analytical understanding of dynamical crack motion in crystals was
important, and complemented the understanding that could come from simulations.

The first analytical solutions for dynamic cracks in a lattice were obtained by Slepyan [15].
