action will be strongest when transpiration, and therefore, also, photosynthesis, are
most active. So that a stream of air rich in oxygen will be drawn down the
intercellular spaces, and thence diffusing into the vessels, will produce the excess of
oxygen often found in them,

60 DR. A. J. EWART ON THE ASCENT OF WATER IN TREES.

Section 13.—The Influence of Death on Flow.

The fact that the water flows equally well up or down cut stems appears to indicate
the absence of any vital pumping action, for this would naturally tend to favour flow
in the customary direction. Furthermore, SrraspurGER killed stems for considerable
distances (as much as 10 metres) and observed that the parts above remained fresh
for some time. The proof is not perfectly satisfactory, since in the case of a large
tree, the trunk and branches may contain sufficient available water when fully
saturated for from 1-3 weeks’ transpiration. In addition to this stems killed by
heating to 80° C. appear to have their conductivity permanently reduced, possibly
owing to the swelling of the walls of the wood-vessels, or to the partial occlusion of
their lumina. This is well shown by the following experiment with 25 centims. of an
apple, using a head of 3 metres of water.
