that the one cannot continue the effect commenced by the other, whether it be for
the production or for the destruction of the photogenic effect. I would again ob-
serve, whenever I speak of a photogenic effect, I mean that which gives to the Da-
guerreotype plate the property of attracting the vapours of mercury.

If we expose a plate covered by an engraving to the red light 5000 times longer
than is required to produce an effect by white light, we obtain by the fixation of
mercury a feeble image, the lights of which are of a grey tone. I could never go
beyond this feeble image, which appeared to be the maximum of effect for the red
glass. It is impossible to attribute this effect to some feeble quantity of rays, pro-
perly called photogenie, passing through the coloured glasses, for we have seen that
the blue and violet rays cannot operate under the destructive action of the red rays ;
this fact proves then evidently, that if the red radiation has a photogenic effect, it
cannot be due to the same principle which produces the photogenic effect of the rays
Situated at the other extremity of the spectrum. The yellow glass has also a pecu-
liar photogenic action of its own, it is a hundred times slower than that of white
light, whilst its destructive action is not more than ten times as slow. We can ob-
tain by the photogenic action of the yellow glass an image almost identical, as to
force and colour, with an image produced by daylight ; with this difference, that the
excess of action does not give the blue solarization which we observe upon plates
strongly affected by daylight.

'The different nature of the photogenic action of red, orange and yellow glasses,
from that of the daylight, is also proved by the fact, that the photogenic action pro-
duced by these coloured glasses cannot be destroyed by their own reversing action,
