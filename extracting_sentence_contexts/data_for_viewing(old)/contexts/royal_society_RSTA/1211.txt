for planet formation, subsequent planet migration, and ice line evolution must all be compatible,
which is difficult to achieve in current models [92,96].

(b) Rock giant

In the rock giant model of Neptune, there are still significant quantities of ice in the interior,
but most of the heavy elements are supplied by rock instead of ice. The rock giant model has
the advantage that Neptune can be formed from more conventional objects with similar rock-ice
ratios to Pluto, giant planet moons, and KBOs. KBOs appear to have a wide range of relative ice
compositions from almost pure rock to almost pure ice with smaller objects tending to have lower
densities, suggesting they are more ice-rich [97]. For example, a large object such as Pluto has a
relatively high rock:ice ratio of approximately 3 : 1 [98]. Recent observations and modelling show
that a rock fraction of approximately 0.7 can in fact fits many of these objects, with variations in
porosity explaining the density-size trend rather than variations in ice content [99]. If Neptune
were formed from such objects the interior would be rock-dominated and have a much lower
O/H enrichment, perhaps around 30-130 times solar. A lower O/H enrichment would also be
more consistent with the 50-100 C/H enrichment, assuming typical Neptune formation scenarios,
except those in which the heavy elements derive from clathrate hydrates (e.g. [100]). Another
advantage of a rock giant is that the reduced fractional content of ice means that the D/H ratio can
be explained with primordial ices with a similar D/H enrichment to present-day solar system ices,
even in the case of complete internal mixing, which allows a greater range of realistic formation
scenarios [9]. Additionally, sequestering significant quantities of rocky material in the cores of
Uranus and Neptune during planet formation could potentially explain the deficit of refractory
material in the surface of the Sun compared to similar stars without planets [101].
