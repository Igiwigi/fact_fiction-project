It would seem, however, if the electrical indications are to be relied upon,
and we see no reason to discredit them, that the impulses which enter the central
structures from He, suffer a diminution which more than counterbalances any such
addition. We are, however, well aware that the reduction may be due to a spread
of nerve impulses in their passage through the afferent side of a centre; and since a
similar reduction occurs both in the case of impulses descending the pyramidal tracts,
and emerging in the roots, as well as in those which as described are reflex in character,
we incline to the opinion that ascending nerve impulses do suffer a diminution in
intensity in their passage through the afferent side of a centre. With reference to the impulses descending the pyramidal tracts, whether originating
in the cortex cerebri or the fibres of the corona radiata, the facts given in Chapters V.
and VI. suggest that a very considerable reduction occurs before they emerge in the
anterior roots. In this connection we would here draw attention to some experiments which we
have made to record the muscular contraction evoked by excitation of the spinal
centres, and particularly to measure the time between excitation and the commence-
ment of the muscular contraction. ‘The period of delay or latency thus estimated
was ascertained by the use of TiGERSTEDT’s signal method, as described in Chapter III.,
Section 8, and in Chapter VIII., Section 1.
