Determination of Roots of A; = 0.

To determine the roots of the equation A, = 0 it is necessary to assume a value
for 6 and a value for P, and to calculate the values of the determinant formed by
taking the first 1, 2, 3, 4,..., rows and columns of A;. Owing to the fact that
all the diagonal terms after the first two are equal to 1 the actual numerical value of
the determinant converges to a definite limit. Taking a value of 4 and a series of
suitable values of P, the value of P for which A; changes sign is found by interpolation.
This is the root of A; = 0 which corresponds with the particular value of 4 chosen.
By taking a series of suitable values of 6 the maximum root of A; = 0 is found, and
also the corresponding value of 0.

Tn evaluating A, for any value of P and 6 the method adopted was first to find the
numerical values of the terms, then to eliminate successively the third, fourth, fifth, etc.,
rows and columns. The effect of this procedure was to alter the values of the first
four terms in the top left-hand corner of A;. It was found, however, that after this
operation had been repeated a few times no further alteration occurred, the effect of
