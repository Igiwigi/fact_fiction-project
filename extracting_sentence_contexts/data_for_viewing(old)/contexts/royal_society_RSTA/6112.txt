and (c) distortion by self-generated zonal flow with even parity. Suppression and saturation take place due to not tilting like
(c,.) but by bending. (d) Temperature relaxation ST (difference from the initial profile) and corresponding that of 5 (Ro /Lr) due
to the ITG mode near saturation of ITG mode from the df simulation of GKNET. (e) The produced radial electric field due to the
zonal flow and temperature relaxation given in (d), which show in-phase relation (data: those from [33]). (Online version in

) couples with pressure corrugation as seen in the distribution of R/Lr in figure 7b, and Ete)
and R/Lr exhibit a clear (face to face) in-phase relation. Namely, the steepening of the temperature
profile is regulated not by a simple turbulent suppression due to the Ege shear, but by the
balance with the Ego? field itself through radial force balance relation. This is also consistent with
the fact that FY shale and 3E®) are in-phase, and 5E®) is determined so as to satisfy the radial
