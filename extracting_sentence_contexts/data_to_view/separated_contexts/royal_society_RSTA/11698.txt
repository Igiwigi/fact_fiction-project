The proper thickness was calculated from the results
@btained by one of us in a paper on “ Quartz Threads” (‘ Phil. Mag.’ [5], vol. 30,
8. 99, 1890), and the thread was then picked out by measurement with a microscope ;

i factor of safety of about 2 being generally allowed. As a matter of fact, the thread
Bequired is very fine, but not unmanageably so: pieces about 25 centims. long were
generally used. We find that the thread can be fastened more securely by a little
“nelted shellac than by hard paraffin; we have had several accidents from the thread
“Slipping out of the paraffin. Of course shellac that has not been overheated or

issolved in alcohol, must be used.
