His vision
and leadership shaped e-Science, in the UK and beyond, such that it has been
able to generate work of the quality that is demonstrated in these two issues. We
are pleased to include the paper that won the award (‘Reconfiguring practice:
the interdependence of experimental procedure and computing infrastructure in
distributed earthquake engineering’) in the second part of this Theme Issue. The
quantity and quality of entries for the award were high, reflecting the fact that
many young scientists have been attracted to e-Science, which has opened up
novel ways for them to tackle key problems. It was also encouraging to see that
many young researchers are confident enough to collaborate across disciplines in
order to bring multiple perspectives to a scientific challenge. This has now gone
beyond the ‘traditional’ e-Science model in which computer scientists collaborate
with domain scientists, and we are beginning to see the benefits of the widespread
involvement of, for example, social scientists and those in the arts and humanities.
