anew; and all his pounded ice being expended, he was fortu-
nately obliged to ſubſtitute ſnow in its place, With this freſh
mixture he had the fatisfaCtion of ſeeing the mercury in _his-.
thermometer fink to — 100, and in ſucceſſive experiments to

— 244% and - 352% Surpriſed at fo unexpeRed an event, he
drew the inſtrument out of the mixture, and carefully exa= -
mined its_bulb, to ſee if it had received any injury 3 but he | $i
found it perfe&ly entire, and moreover perceived a much more {
unexpected phznomenon, that the. quickſilver was fixed, and ©
remained immoveable above 12 minutes. On repeating the ſame
experiment with another thermometer, graduated no lower than ;
= 220), all the mercury ſunk into the ball, and. became ſolid 3
as before, not beginning to re-aſcend till after a ſtill longer -*

y

interval of time. From theſe appearances the profeſſor very juſtly concluded,

that the quickſilver in both inſtruments had , been fixed or |
frozen by. the cold ; but as the evidence was not yet complete, |
he only ventured to propoſe the congelation of mercury as a
probable truth, at the next meeting of the Academy held three
days afterwards; and in the mean time was making prepara-
tions to acquire more palpable proofs of the fact. The ther-,
mometers ordered with this view, were, not ready till the 25th,»
of December O. S. when, in company with the celebrated 7
ZAyINUs, Profeflor of Phyſics, he performed the experiment with
fimilar materials, and as ſoon as he found the quickfilver, 1um-
moveable, broke the bulb of his thermometer.
