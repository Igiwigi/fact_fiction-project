(1.) The column which starts from the positive terminal will be found suddenly

to terminate at the tinfoil ring in a bright column of small diameter

occupying the centre of the tube. This column is usually striated, and
ends in a stria with rounded head.

(2.) On the side of the tinfoil towards the negative end of the tube a conical column of
luminosity is seen to start from the inside of the tube immediately beneath
the tinfoil, and to stretch towards the negative terminal. This cone, in fact,
forms the base of the new positive column.

(3.) On examination, this luminous cone is found to be hollow, the interior having
an ill-defined and hazy surface in strong contrast with the somewhat sharp

A and regular outline of the exterior (Plate 16, fig. 10).

Q Let us consider what is the explanation of these appearances. We know that

Strong pulsations of positive electricity pass to the positive terminal of the tube and

the tinfoil, keeping time with the passage of the air-sparks. These pulsations, when
