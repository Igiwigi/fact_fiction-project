Under this general form it may be geometrically defined as the curve
whose tangent retains always the same angular position in respect to its axis*, and
in respect to a line drawn from the point where it touches the curye perpendicular to
the axis; or in other words, which traverses the space round the axis always in the
same direction in respect to it. A second property of the logarithmic spiral, equally referring itself to the uniformity
of the animal's operations about the axis of its shell, is this; that it has everywhere the
same geometrical curvature, and is the only curve except the circle which possesses
this property. Certain physiological facts having reference to the growth of the Mollusk are de-
ducible from the geometrical description of its shell. If it be a land shell, its capacity
may be supposed (reasoning from that principle of economy which is an observable
law in Nature) to be precisely suflicient for the reception of the animal who built it. If it be an aquatic $hell, it serves the animal at once as a habitation and as a float ;
enabling it to yary its buoyancy according as it leaves a greater or a less portion of
the narrower extremity of its chamber unoccupied, and thus to ascend or descend in
the water, at will.
