The sterile and fertile segments, as we have seen, are placed alternately one above
the other, so that in every vertical series there is an equal number of each kind, In
the transverse plane there is no alternation. At the same level all the segments
cut medianly are sterile or all fertile (Photographs 12 and 13). It follows from
these facts that of the six segments of each sporophyll, either the three upper must
be fertile and the three lower sterile, or vice versd. The question whether the
upper or lower segments are fertile may seem a simple one to determine, but as
a matter of fact it has presented great difficulties, and for a long time it was
not possible to obtain direct and conclusive evidence from the material available. The segments are long and slender and in only one instance could the same segment
be traced through its whole length from axis to periphery.
