| | The manner, in which the agaric a&ts, is, by contra-
Ring, or purſing up the extremities of the divided veſ-
ſels. I had an opportunity of enquiring into the fact, in -
the caſe of a patient, whoſe leg was cut off below the
knee. Immediately after the amputation, piecesof agaric
were apply'd to, and properly ſecur'd upon, the mouths
of all the principal veſſels. In about an hour after
the operation, the ſtump bled afreſh; on which ac-
count, I remov'd all the dreſſings, except thoſe pieces
of agaric, that were at firſt, apply'd.
