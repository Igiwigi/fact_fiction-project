and form a plexus in front of the aorta. Several smaller ganglia are formed in the
plexus, some of which are s0 minute as to measure only th of an inch. Minute
branches are sent from this plexus towards the aorta, and are lost in its cellular coat,
systems of nerves; one compoxsed of gelatinous nervous fibres which have their origin at the different ganglia ;
the other composed of tubular neryous fibres which arise at the brain and spinal cord ; for notwithstanding
the opposite opinion held by VoLkMany and Bivvpzr, founded as it. is upon very careful and elaborate inves-
tigations, I have assured myself, that the tubular fibres, which are mixed with the gelatinous in the gray cords
of the sympathetic, are really derived from the cerebro-spinal nerves, and do not originate in the ganglia. The
claim of the gelatinous fibres to be considered true nervous fibres is further shown, by many small nerves being
entirely composed of them, and by the ultimate distribution of many of them to the arteries. The s0-called
white roots of the sympathetic are then branches of the spinal nerves, and are distributed to the viscera ; and
the 80-called gray roots, branches of the sympathetic, which passed from the thoracic ganglia, and are distri-
buted to the vessels in the neighbourhood. These facts were demonstrated by preparations at the time this
paper was presented to the Society, but in consequence of their differing from the received opinions upon the

subject, I was diffident of having drawings made from the preparations. The drawings, with their accompany-
ing explanations, will be presented in a supplementary paper.â€”(May 1846.)
