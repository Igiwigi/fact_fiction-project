The required (figure 1c) revealed that the library size used for most of
number for the aptamer candidate sequence, in which at the aptamer generations, except for the anti-DEN1-NS1,
least one aptamer sequence possibly appears, was deter- DEN2-NS1 and DEN4-NS1 aptamers, was too small. How-
mined using the number of essential/important bases and ever, the aptamers were successfully obtained from the
the stem length in each aptamer. The important bases are libraries, suggesting that some factors used for the calculation
indicated in orange-coloured circles in the secondary struc- might not reflect that fact. One of the uncertainties in the cal-
tures in figure 1b. Each important base was estimated by culation is the determination of the important or essential
the data obtained from the second ExSELEX, using doped bases in each aptamer.
