necessary for the investigation thereof. They then compare
the lines, and meridians, of these original diagrams with those
in their diagrams delineated from their own re-SUrVveys re-
cently made ; when it is always expected that the lines, and
meridians, of the former will coincide with those of the latter.
It is evident that this coincidence could not happen if any
variation of the magnetical needle had: taken place in the
intermediate time elapsed between the making of the. first,
and of the last, survey. My business being very extensive, I
was frequently applied to in disputes at law about boundary
lines, and I had, besides, abundance of opportunities, on
other surveys, to ascertain this fact satisfactorily. From all
which I have discovered that the courses of the lines, and
meridians, delineated on the original diagrams annexed to
patents, from 1660, downwards to the present time, and of
the re-survey diagrams thereof, annexed to deeds, coincide
with, and are parallel to, the lines and meridians delineated
