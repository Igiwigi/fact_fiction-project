The unique chemical properties of carbon result in an immensely varied range of
compounds, such as graphite, diamond, hydrocarbons, soot, oil, complex molecules,
etc. In the last decade, the field of carbon N&N emerged, following the discovery of
ullerenes (hollow carbon nanoscale cages) and the identification of carbon nanotubes
(cylindrical tubes consisting of rolled graphene sheets). This is a clear demonstra-
ion of the fact that carbon is even more flexible than previously realized and that
it can adopt various totally unexpected nanoscale morphologies with novel tensile,
electronic and magnetic properties. Carbon, already recognized as the most unique
and versatile of elements, now seems on the verge of giving birth to a vast new range
of exciting technological applications. HAROLD KROTO
