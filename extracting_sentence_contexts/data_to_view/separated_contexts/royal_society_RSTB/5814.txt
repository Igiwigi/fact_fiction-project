Such a photometer is quite unsuited for measuring the effect of the sea surface on the
light, as it ignores all light scattered downwards, by waves, at angles beyond 48-5° with

the vertical, and all light totally reflected by the surface, which may be appreciable in
shallow water over a light-coloured bottom. That the wave effect is important is shown
by the fact that the presence of an opal with its under surface wet renders the readings
obtained just below a disturbed water surface very much steadier. Measurement of the Opacity of the Water. The opacity of the water is indicated by the quantity which we have called the
“vertical absorption coefficient’ (termed the “ vertical transmissive exponent”’ by
some workers*), and denoted in the tables by the symbol y,.
