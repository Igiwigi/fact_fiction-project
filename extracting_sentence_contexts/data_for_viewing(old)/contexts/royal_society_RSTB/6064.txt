that their development conforms in all essentials to the human type, so that for the
details of early Anthropoid ontogeny we depend on the work of the human embryologist.
The outstanding feature of the early human blastocyst is its extraordinary precocity
as exemplified, for example, in the relations it very early acquires to the uterine lining
and in the remarkably early differentiation of its trophoblast and its extra-embryonal
mesodern. It is no longer content to undergo its development in the uterine lumen as
does that of all the lower Primates, but, whilst still quite minute, burrows its way through
the uterine epithelium and implants itself in the very vascular subepithelial decidual
tissue of the uterus. Therein it forms for itself a decidual cavity and undergoes its
subsequent development, completely embedded in the maternal tissue. In this way
the Primate germ reaches the acme of its endeavour to maintain itself in the uterus
and to obtain an adequate supply of nutriment at the earliest possible moment. And it
is an interesting and significant fact that just as the Pithecoid blastocyst always attaches
itself by the embryonal pole, so here that pole is normally the first to enter, so that the
embryo lies on the deep side of the blastocyst in immediate proximity to the site of
formation of the definitive placenta. Certain features, distinctive of the Anthropoids,
are to be regarded as the direct outcome of this process of interstitial implantation and
consequently, as purely secondary specialisations. These include (a) differentiation of
a decidua capsularis from the decidual tissue covering the blastocyst ; (b) formation
round the very early blastocyst of a complete enveloping network of syncytiotrophoblast,
possessing in even more marked degree than that of the Pithecoids, destructive and
penetrative properties ; (c) development from the chorion of the older blastocyst of a
more or less uniform covering of chorionic villi. In the blastocyst itself, formation of
the extra-embryonal mesoderm apparently takes place at such an early period that it
