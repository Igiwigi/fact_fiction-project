The colours of the animals may then have originated in one of three different
ways: as a direct reaction on the part of the animal to the light, the reaction having
no reference to the need for protection ; or it may have been evolved solely in
answer to such need; or it may represent a compromise between the two, the
pigments themselves serving some function other than that of cryptic colouration,
which function is capable of fulfilment by the pigments which have passed the
censorship of protection. A first step toward the determination of which of the
three above-stated alternatives is correct, consists in a thorough physiological and
morphological investigation, without reference to these theories, of the chromatophore-
system of the animals under consideration. If this has for a result the bringing to
light of facts incompatible with the theory that the pigments have and have only
a protective réle, it then becomes necessary to cast about in order to ascertain what
other function they possess,

We have taken the first step. In the course of our observations a number of
facts have come to light which are difficult of interpretation in terms of protection. The nocturnal blue colouration which, as we have described, is assumed by Hippolyte
varians and other Crustacea, cannot, as we conceive, be regarded as conferring any
protection on these animals.
