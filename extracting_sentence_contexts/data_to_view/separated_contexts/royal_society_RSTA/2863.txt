How to open out
the scale on the sides is a matter of judgment, but the amount of enlargement is
based on the fact that the mean temperature shown along any even kilometre height
should coincide with that giv@n in Tables IT. and III. The distance across may be
taken roughly as 1000 miles. Fig. 1 obviously fails in this respect ; it is only meant as a representation of the
facts disclosed in the tables previously given. In both figures the full lines represent
the section of the isobaric surfaces by a vertical plane, and the dotted lines the
sections of the isothermal surfaces. Fhe broken lines show the departure of the
temperature + or â€” at any point from the mean value for that height.
