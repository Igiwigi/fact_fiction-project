is then, in the “ opening ”’ reaction and its transference to neighbouring pedicellariae,
evidence of nervous connexions outside the body of the pedicellaria, while in the
“closing”? reaction, which is not transmitted from one pedicellaria to another,
there is evidence of an independent sensory-motor system within the body of the
organ. JENNINGS (1907) found, moreover, that in the absence of inhibitory impulses
stimulation of the inside of the valve caused closure, while stimulation of the outer
surface caused opening of the valves. As a result of JeNNING’s work it is established
that while many of the movements of the pedicellaria are coordinated with those
of its neighbours, each individual pedicellaria is capable of a functional autonomy ;
which autonomy, we may add, is determined by the independent sensory-motor
system of the organ. We are aided in our search for the nervous reflex arcs by the
knowledge that closing or opening are respectively conditioned by stimulation of the
inside or outside of the valve. With these facts in mind we are in a position better to
appreciate the morphological features of the straight and crossed pedicellariae of
Marthasterias glacialis, particularly as regards the musculature and its innervation.

1—The Straight Pedicellariae

The straight pedicellariae are usually solitary, and are restricted in their distribu-
tion to the sides of the disk and to the margins of the ambulacral grooves, where they
are borne on the adambulacral spines. In specimens of Marthasterias glacialis with
an arm length of 25 mm., the straight pedicellariae, which are sessile, may attain a
length of one-third of a millimetre. In longitudinal sagittal section (fig. 29A), the
pedicellaria is seen to consist of two equal and similar blades, each of which is
supported by an ossicle (4/. oss.)—the calcareous material of which has been dissolved
