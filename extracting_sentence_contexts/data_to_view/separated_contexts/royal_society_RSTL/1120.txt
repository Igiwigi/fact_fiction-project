We are now unavoidably led into a discussion of a question
which has at all times occupied the attention of naturalists. v8 Dr. Ridfikiips08”s Letter on the basatti: Surface
Whence\arise «the Tnequatlilies with which the Surface of the
Earthis' $0:exceedingly diversified?. «;

I shall not attempt to encounter this question""generally,
nor to extend my enquiries' beyond the limits I have pre-
scribed to myself; but I shall try whether' the curious facts
so profusely exhibited over our basaltic area, throw any light
upon the formation of our own inequalities, or lead us a step
towards the discovery of the operations by which such stu-
pendous effects have been produced. Some to escape the difficulties in which this question is
involved, ascribe our inequalities to original formation ; as if
the world had come from the hand of the Creator withithe
variegated surface which now contributes 0 much” to its
beauty ; but the frequent interruptions; and resumptions of the
Strata in our area, with the perfect resemblance of the corres-
ponding parts, however great the mterval by which they are
separated, can' scarcely leave a'doubt that these strata were at
first 'continuous ; of course, the figure of our surface at: that
time must have depended on the original positions and incli-
nations of 'these strata, which, as appears by the-gd fact; are
now unconnected with the superficial line, the figure of which
is governed hy their abruptions and removals alone. Naturalists have differed much in opinion as to the direc-
tion in which the causes acted that produced the inequalities
on the surface of our globe ; some referring us to the bowels
of the” earth as to the scene of action ; while others assert
that the operations were performed upon the surface itself.
