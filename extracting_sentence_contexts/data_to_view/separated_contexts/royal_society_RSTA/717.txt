The value should be regarded as an upper limit. 13—GENERAL REMARKS ON THE EARTH MOVEMENTS

Hitherto, in discussing the results we have referred to the first shock and the main
movement observed in the record of one of the local earthquakes as the P and S waves
respectively. Do these wave motions correspond in actual fact to the waves similarly
designated in the description of the seismograph record of a distant earthquake? There
is no doubt that they do correspond to two different types of wave motion propagated
with different speeds. Apart from the clear evidence provided by the “distant”
shocks there is a general tendency for the duration of the fore shock to increase the
farther the distance of the focus from the seismograph station in the case of the
“local” shocks in Montserrat.
