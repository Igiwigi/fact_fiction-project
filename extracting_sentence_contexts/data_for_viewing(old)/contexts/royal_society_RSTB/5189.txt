No trace of a pecten can be found in any Amphibian eye, unless we choose so to call
the patch of grey pigment which is very commonly to be seen spread over the greater
part of the disc of the Anura and Salamanders. But this light grey pigment is quite
different in appearance from that which begins to assert itself in the various families of
the Chelonia. In the Amphibia the disc merely appears as if it had received a wash of
grey paint. There is no heaping up of pigment as one observes for the first time in
Chelodina longicollis. There is no trace of vascularization, which one also meets with
for the first time in Ymyda granosa (Burgoma river-turtle), or any sign of differentiation.
In some of the Ranide which form the highest family among the Amphibia (as, for
example, in Rana cateshbiana), the pigment coating is certainly black and not grey, but
even then it is impossible to associate it with either a vestigial relic or the commence-
ment of a pecten. The fact that one never finds a pecten in any eye which is provided
with either retinal or hyaloid blood vessels, unless it is a mere vestigial relic, such as one
frequently meets with in certain families of the Marsupials and very occasionally among
the Rodents (e.g., Agoutis), seems sufficient reason for doing so. Moreover, if we
trace the growth of the pecten from its source, we find a gradual increase in the amount
of pigment and fine blood vessels or capillaries, which at first form tiny functionless
loops, become more and more enveloped in pigment, and as they progress form first
a mossy cushion, as in the Crocodilia, and then as they fill up with secreting cells they
coalesce, and thus prepare the way to form a prominent functional pecten which occupies
the greater part of, or the whole of, the disc, and ultimately protrudes far into the vitreous.

This we find, first of all in the Geckos, and better developed in the next higher group, the
Lacerte, which have a perfectly active pecten, although often of a still somewhat primi-
