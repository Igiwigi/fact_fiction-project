I much regret I was unavoidably prevented from examining this
locality with all the attention it deserved. But from the structure of the small ter-
races, it appeared to me certain that water must for a period have occupied a level
above that of the highest shelf of Glen Roy; and likewise that fragments of a shelf,
or line of terrace, which as far as the eye could judge was horizontal, extended within

the basin of the Spey, and therefore beyond the limits of the supposed lake of Roy. This
latter fact is, at least, certain, for I have since learned, through the kindness of Sir
Davip BrewsTE, that he has seen, as will be hereafter mentioned, shelyes resembling
those of Glen Roy at two points, at a distance of several miles down the valley of the
Spey. The watershed at the head of the valley of Kilfinnin, has precisely the same
character with the foregoing cases : here also a flat-topped buttress projects on one
side above the level of the shelf, and this seems to indicate, as in the former case, the
presence of water at a leyel rather above that of the shelf itself*,

The division of the waters between most of the glens and ravines in this district,
in situations where no shelyes occur, does not take place on a sharp ridge, but on
level, and often broad land-straits, similar to those just described. I may instance a
long one (at an elevation of between 1400 and 1500 feet aboye the sea,) separating
two branches of the water which flows by Habercalder into the Great Glen, and one
branch of the Tarf Water.
