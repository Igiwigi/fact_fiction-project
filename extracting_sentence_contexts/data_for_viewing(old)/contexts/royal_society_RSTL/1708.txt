and which, he observed, might affect the relation of the
cistern and scale. That the alteration should have taken
place at that time and in some such manner ; and that the
mercury which appeared between the cistern and its cover
had lodged there accidentally in the original putting toge-
ther of the instrument, and that it was not therefore con-
cerned in producing the change, would seem the more
probable supposition, than that it should have escaped subse-
quently from the cistern ; since, if a part of the mercury had
found a means of escape, more would have followed either
then or since, which however has not been s0, as no altera-
tion has taken place subsequently in the relative indications
of the two barometers. Having ascertained this last fact on
my arrival at Spitzbergen, in July, a careful series of compa-

*risons was instituted to determine the exact amount of the

alteration since the original comparison at Mr. NEWMAN's,
and to obtain a fresh index correction and neutral point, since
each would be alike affected, whether the cause were 'a



trigonometrical measurements at Spitzbergen. 299
