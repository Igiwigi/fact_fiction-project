This has been made possible by systematic advances in algorithms and numerical techniques, but
most of all by an extraordinary, steady, decades-long exponential expansion of computing power. Figure 1 shows the expansion of computing power at one of the laboratories that in fact traces its
history back to the von Neumann era. The very first numerical weather forecast was in fact issued
in 1956 from the IBM 701 [4], which is the first computer shown in figure 1. Numerical meteorology, based on a representation of real numbers in a finite number of bits,
also serendipitously led to one of the most profound discoveries of the latter half of the twentieth
century, namely that even completely deterministic systems have limits to the predictability of the
future evolution of the system [5].! Simply knowing the underlying physics does not translate to
an ability to predict beyond a point.
