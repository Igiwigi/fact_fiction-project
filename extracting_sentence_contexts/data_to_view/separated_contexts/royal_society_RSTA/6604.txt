Suppose that
the product (x? -+-x3) x, is not equivalent to a multiple of

u3 + u3 + ud +-u3 uy — uj uy + Quip us —uzu, — 3uy Uy Us. (40)

Then the inequalities | (xf +23) x5 |< Tas) ia ie | Xs) ae (41)
have infinitely many solutions for any ¢>0, as also have the inequalities

| (x43) "I< 75 23) |D|, xi+x3<e. (42)

If (x2 +3) x, is equivalent to a multiple of (40), then (41) and (42) have an infinity of solutions if the

first inequality signs are replaced by equalities. Proof. This is similar to that of theorem 5, and depends on the facts that the body
