Laſt
Summer I read three Memoirs at our weekly Meet-
ings, which contained many Particulars on this Sub-
jet: 'But-as theſe were Matters of mere Curioſity,

and of no real Uſe, they almoſt tired out my Pa-

tience. I now ſend you ſome Experiments, which

I made during the Vacation, which ſeem to pro-

miſe at leaſt the being of ſome Seryice ; but of this

you will be the beſt Judge, 1 will deſcribe them in

the ſame Order as I-made them, and to which I was

not led by mere Accident. You know, that when

a Veſſel full of Liquor, which runs out through a

Pipe, is clearified, the eleftrified Jet or Stream is

thrown farther than uſual, and is diverged into ſe-

yeral divergent Rays, much in the ſame mannec

as the Water poured out from a watering Pot.

'Every body at firſt Sight will judge, that the
Stream is accelerated, and that the eleQrificd

| Veſſel will ſoon be empty, 1 was unwilling to
rely. on the firſt Appearances, and therefore re-

ſolyed to aſcertain the Fact, by meaſuring the

Time, and the Quantity of the Liquor running our. B b And

And in order to know if the Acceleration, ſuppo-
ſing there was any,” was uniform, during the whole
Time of the running out, 1 made wiſe of Veſlels of
different Capacities, terminating in Pipes of differ-
ent Bores, from three Lines Diameter to the ſmalleſt
Capillaries: And I give you in groſs the Reſult of
upwards of an hundred Experiments, as It is not ſo
caly a Task to draw .a ſafe Concluſion, as may at
firſt be imagined.

1. The clerified Stream, tho! it divides, and carries
the Liquid farther, is neither accelerared nor re-
tarded ſenſibly, when the Pipe, thro' which it if- |
ſues, is not leſs than a Line in Diameter.
