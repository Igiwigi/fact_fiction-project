By applying the criterion, which I saall presently
explain, we cut off a great variety of series whose sums are
erroneously given by the method in question ; whether this
criterion does not exclude some series whose sums: are cor-
rectly given, is a point which I do not consider yet completely
decided ; the difficulties to which the application of acknow-
ledged principles have in this instance conducted us, appear
worthy cf the attention of mathematicians. A more strict
method might have been pursued in determining the sum of
that part of the series which is neglected ; but this in general
leads to such differential equations, as cannot afford us much
assistance. I have, however, given one example of this
method, and I have shown that when the part which had been
neglected, as being apparently equal to zero (but which is in
fact a finite quantity,) is added to the sum furnished by the
method of expanding horizontally and summing vertically, the true
value of the series results. This confirms the. explanation I
have given of the reason of the apparent failure of that
method. It will be sufficient to point out the cause which leads to
error, and to determine the conditions on which its existence
depends for one only of the series; suitable modifications of .
the reasoning will readily suggest themselves for the others.
