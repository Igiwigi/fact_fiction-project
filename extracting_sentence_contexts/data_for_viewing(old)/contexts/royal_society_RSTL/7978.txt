EZ Since a propelling instrument which acts by the reaction of the water, as a paddle,

S A SCreW, an oar, or a jet, drives the particles of water astern, it tends to diminish the
height of the crest of a wave, and to increase the depth of a trough or hollow ;—in
the former case diminishing, and in the latter increasing the energy of the wave, which
partly goes to waste in the case of divergence; and hence it follows that it is favourable
to economy of power that 8uch a propelling instrument should act on the crest, rather
than on the hollow of a wave. This fact is well known in practice.

The production of diverging waves is not prevented by totally submerging the dis-
turbing body ; but those waves are of less height at the surface of the water, the more
deeply the body is covered. 'The virtual depth, and consequently the speed, of the waves
of the second and third classes increases, and their angle of divergence diminishes, with
