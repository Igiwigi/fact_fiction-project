nodules which contain the marine shells so characteristic of the seams in which true
“coal balls” are found. The typical roof is composed of black shales, in which the
nodules are to be seen directly above the coal, sometimes even pressing down upon it
so as to leave their imprint on the surface of the seam. These nodules vary con-
siderably in size, but on the average are of larger size and more uniformly symmetrical
than those in the coal. Such a nodule, of considerable size, is seen at R, fig. 4,
Plate 17.

Each nodule has the form of an oblate spheroid, and lies in the shales so that its
greatest diameter is parallel to the bedding plane. When cut through, these nodules
often show a distinct though very fine bedding in the same direction as the bedding
of the shales, and frequently the small Goniatites within them congregate in bands
along the planes of this bedding (fig. 16, Plate 19). These facts prove that the nodules

must have been formed in situ; had they originated elsewhere such an arrangement of
the bedding would be impossible, The fact that the floor and the roof nodules are
formed in situ lends support, were it needed, to the argument that the seam nodules
were also formed where they are found.

In these roof nodules isolated plants are also to be found in which the tissues are
partly excellently preserved. The plant tissues are generally completely surrounded,
