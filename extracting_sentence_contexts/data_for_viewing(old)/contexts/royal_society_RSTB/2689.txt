with which it has been in contact and every part of the picture can be identified ;
but this is not always the case, for with certain woods a picture is always formed
which is not visible to the eye even if the wood be examined with a magnifying glass,
This is specially the case with bass wood. Fig. 19 is an ordinary photographic
picture of a specimen of this wood and fig. 20 is the picture produced in the dark.
Figs. 21 and 22 show the strong difference there is in the pictures of olive wood
obtained by these different processes, and figs. 21A and 224 show the Cifference in
cherry wood. With some specimens of the wood of Abies pectinata the same thing
occurs. Bar wood also gives in the dark a picture in which apparently a large number
of cracks are represented ; these are not visible in the wood. That the picture produced
in the dark is perfectly definite and constant is shown by the fact that if successive
sections of the same branch be used the same picture is always produced. The botanist
may be able to throw some light on this curious fact.

The true bark, the outside layer of a tree, appears to be in almost all cases quite
devoid of activity, but the layer within it, often of a brownish colour, is very active,
even more so than any other part of the wood. Fig. 23 is a transverse section of a
small Pinus pinaster, showing that the outer layers, which were remarkably thick in
this case, were more active than the wood itself. Fig. 24 represents two pieces of
larch bark, and shows the great activity of the inner layer. With the oak and the
beech the same thing holds good, the outside inactive and a thin layer between the
bark and the wood very active. In the case of the Rhizophora mucronata wood the
bark is about 4 inch thick, but it acts in the same way as the other woods. In the
cases where the resin canals come up within the bark they, of course, are very active.
This is shown in fig. 25, where a series of dots are seen round the outside of the
