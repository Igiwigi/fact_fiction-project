The bursts correspond to the press and release events, while there was almost no response in-
between. The contact onset is associated with a decrease whereas contact release generates a
signal increase. The signal peaks are arranged in sequence reflecting the fact that the touches
were applied to the sensors sequentially. Figure 5c shows that the sensing system can capture
multiple touches when they were applied simultaneously. Finally, figure 5d shows a sliding
pattern that started on the palm, crossed the volar side of the index finger and ended on the
fingertip of the index finger.
