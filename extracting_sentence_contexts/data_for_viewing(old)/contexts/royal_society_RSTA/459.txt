harder to explain. This reduction in the northward heat transport persisted through to the next
year and likely drove the cooling of the sub-tropical Atlantic [67]. This may have contributed to
the anomalously cold northern European winter the following year [68].

Data assimilating model simulations, such as the Met Office FOAM system, that are driven
by the observed ocean data can reproduce the mean strength and depth of the AMOC,
including the reduction associated with the 2009 event [65]. This is reproduced in figure 19.
As RAPID observations are not currently assimilated by the FOAM system (although studies
have considered this [69]), they can be used for independent evaluation of the initialized model
state—analogous to the use of surface drifters to assess the initialization of the ocean mesoscale,
as discussed in §2.

More surprising is the fact that when only atmospheric boundary conditions are prescribed (i.e.
no ocean data are assimilated), the FOAM system still captures the majority of the 30% reduction
in the 2009-2010 event (blue lines in figure 19). This result does not preclude an important role
for the ocean in constraining the evolution of the atmosphere during this time. However, it does
indicate that constraining surface momentum and buoyancy fluxes is sufficient to explain the
seasonal and interannual variability of the AMOC at 26° N and indicates a limited role for initial-
condition-dependent mesoscale activity in driving the observed event during 2009-2010 [65,70].
How representative this behaviour is of other large interannual AMOC variability will need to be
examined using further observations (along with further modelling studies). It may, however, be
consistent with studies that suggested tropical Pacific SSTs as the source of the strong negative
NAO anomaly in 2009-2010 [71].

In addition to the 2009-2010 event, the extension of the RAPID time series appears to show
