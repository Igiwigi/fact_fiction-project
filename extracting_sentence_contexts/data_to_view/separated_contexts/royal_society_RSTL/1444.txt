When I employ the doubler to investigate atmospheric
electricity, I use it with its revolving plate uninsulated, when
opposite to that fixed plate which is insulated; because, with
respect to insulation, that position of the doubler exactly
corresponds to the insulated and uninsulated parts of my high
pointed rod, and of course their electrical accumulation will
always be of the same kind in all weak electrifications of the
atmosphere. To avoid repetition, permit me here also to
mention, that care has been always taken to clear the doubler

of its former electric charge, before I proceeded to accymulate
another. Some observations which I made some time ago, induced
me to suspect that air, by being vitiated even in a small de-
gree in various ways, as by respiration, putrefaction, &c. lost
a portion of its natural electricity, and became thereby elec-
trified negatively: the following facts seem to substantiate
this supposition. The room I usually inhabit being of small
dimensions, is on that account more liable to suffer a change
in the electrical state of its air than a larger one ; and having
been often struck with the constancy of the doubler charging
negatively in it, whereas in the open air, and often in the ad-
Joining room, which is larger, the doubler would give positive
electricity ; I saw nothing to occasion this difference between
the two rooms besides what could he attributed to the respira-
tion and to the usual effluvium of my body. I was therefore
curious to try on the gth of July, 179g, whether a change
could be effected in the electrical state of the air in the large
room by the same means.
