ยง 4. There is a further source of inaccuracy in the ordinary method of measuring
permeability, of which the effects are usually small, but can on occasion become quite
noticeable. It may be of interest to describe a method of procedure by which such
effects can be eliminated almost entirely.

In the usual way of measuring permeability by the ballistic method the galvano-
meter circuit includes, in addition to the ring secondary, one of the two coils of an
inductor not containing iron. The convenience of this arrangement arises from the
fact that by its use measurements of resistance are avoided which otherwise would be
necessary owing to the fact that the total flow of electricity in a circuit, in which
a given change of induction is produced, depends upon its resistance. The method is
especially convenient when, as in experiments of the kind described in this paper, the
resistance of the secondary circuit has a succession of different values. But, unless
certain precautions are taken, values of the permeability determined in the way just
indicated are frequently liable to quite appreciable error owing to the effect of
hysteresis in the ring secondary.

The quantity of electricity indicated by the galvanometer throw, when a current
is established in the primary either of the inductor or of the ring, is a measure of the
total change of induction in the secondary circuit. When a current is established in
the primary coil of the ring the total change of induction in the secondary of the
inductor is zero and the galvanometer throw therefore indicates the total change of
