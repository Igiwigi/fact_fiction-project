â€˜The observations have, however,
not before been generalised. Frank considers that the conditions are those of true symbiosis. He in fact
concluded that the chlorophyllous tree acquires the carbon, and the fungus the water
and the mineral matters, that is the soil nutriment. Frank did not refer to nitrogen. But there is no reason to suppose that the
fungus could not, as do the fungi in the case of fairy rings for example, avail itself of
the organic nitrogen of the soil.
