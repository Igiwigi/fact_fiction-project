and well circumscribed, but not with confidence in more
diverse assemblages from elsewhere in the world where
often a number of similar spore morphotypes occur. Spores
of all of the other Rhynie plants belong to Retusotriletes spp.
This taxon is not very distinctive and has been reported
in situ from many plant types (particularly from zosterophylls)
[54-57]. Thus it is unsafe to identify its parent plant within
the Rhynie assemblages and certainly in other assemblages
from elsewhere.

(c) Interpretation
This diversity of the Rhynie dispersed spore assemblage is
lower than all of the other sequences, despite the fact that
the Rhynie sequence was one of the most exhaustively
sampled with 70 productive samples logged. This suggests
that the Rhynie flora was somewhat depauperate compared
to the others. The most likely explanation is that the Rhynie
flora represents one existing in an inland intermontane
basin where the environment was more stressed than that
in the lowland floodplain deposits represented by the depos-
its from southwest Wales and Gasp√©. The very high taxon
diversity reported from the Ardennes-Rhenish region probably
reflects the fact that these assemblages are from nearshore
marine deposits into which numerous rivers drained bringing
elements of the floras from throughout the entire drainage
