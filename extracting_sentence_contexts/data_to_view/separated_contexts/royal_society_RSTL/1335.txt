Now, in this experiment, there was surely room
enough for the influence to pass through both metals, and the
moisture immediately touching them, without going near to
the nerve. I think it, therefore, probable, that motions are in
no case produced by any thing passing from the dry exciters
through the muscles and nerve, but that they are occasioned
by some influence, naturally contained in those bodies as moist
substances, being suddenly put in motion when the two dry
exciters are made to touch both them, and each other ; in like
manner as persons, it is said, have been killed by the motion -
of their proper quantity of the electric fluid. But to return
from conjecture to facts, I shall now examine, whether it be
always necessary to employ two dry exciters, that is, two
metals, or one metal and charcoal, in order to occasion con-
tractions. c
Gold and zinc, the first the most perfect of the metals, the
other an imperfect one, operate together very powerfully in pro-
ducing contractions; while gold, and the next most perfect me-
tal, silver, operate very feebly. It would seem. therefore, that
the more similar the metals are, which are thus used, the less is
the power arising from their combination. Two pieces of the
same metal, but with different portions of alloy, are still more
feeble than gold and silver ; and the power of such pieces be-
comes less and less, in proportion as they approach each other.
in point of purity.
