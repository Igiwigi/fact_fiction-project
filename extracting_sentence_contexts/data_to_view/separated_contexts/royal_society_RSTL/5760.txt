MR. HANCOCK ON THE ORGANIZATION OF THE BRACHIOPODA. 837

"Tt is not easy to explain this phenomenon on the supposition that the corpuscles are
1 y blood-globules ; but the difficulty would at, once disappear if it were assumed that,
80me local disease had produced this abnormal condition in the contents of the ceca;
in which case it must be concluded that the corpuscles form an integral part of the cweca
themselves, or rather that they are permanently placed within these organs, and do not
flow through them, as they must do were the cxca connected with respiration. Tt is also a significant fact, that the Terebratulidae are liable to be covered with extra-
neous matter. Several of the individuals of W. australis that have passed through my
| were extensively encrusted with zoophytic and other parasitic growths; and one
Qor two of T. caput-8erpentis had both valves entirely enveloped in a dense downy coat, of
Rome species of sponge. 'This appears, from what Fornrs and Haxuey state im their
ED British Mollusca,' to be frequently the case, and to have gained for the specimens 80
Sclothed the specific name of pubescens. Were the czca respiratory organs, even in a
Ssecondary capacity, this would hardly be the case.
