XVI—TuHE OENocyTES

The oenocytes are found in all the three stages of the flea larva. They are
colourless and are distributed as free cells among the cells of the parietal fat tissue.
They (fig. 57, oe.) show variation in their form and size owing to their compression
by the surrounding fat cells, but normally they are sub-spherical in form. They
occur in the pleural regions of all the first nine abdominal segments. The presence
of oenocytes in the ninth abdominal segment of the flea larva is a point of great
interest. According to most investigators (SNopGRAss, 1935, p. 411), the oenocytes
originate in the embryo from the ectoderm at places just posterior to the spiracles
in the first eight segments. Thus the association of the oenocytes with spiracles is
purely incidental and has no morphological significance. As a matter of fact, the
oenocytes are ectodermal in origin and their presence in the ninth abdominal seg-
ment in which the spiracles are absent clearly indicates that the formation of oeno-
cytes is not confined to any particular part of the ectoderm, as is often considered to
be the case. They are smaller than the surrounding fat cells, being only 21-29 »
in the larger diameter. Their number on each side of a segment varies from five to
eight. Usually they are found away from the epidermis but sometimes, a little
before second larval ecdysis, some of these oenocytes are embedded in the epidermis
with one end, which is narrow, closely applied to the cuticle and the other broad
end projecting into the body cavity, thus showing that new oenocytes are formed
from the epidermis. They are often found arranged in groups of closely placed
free cells and are not held together by-fine branches of tracheae, as is the case with
Lepidoptera and Trichoptera (vide SNopGRass, 1935, p. 411).
