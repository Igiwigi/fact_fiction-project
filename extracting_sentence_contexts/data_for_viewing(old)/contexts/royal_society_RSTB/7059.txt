without anaesthesia, the urine was collected by manual expression every half-hour. Since
the animals were not hydrated the urine flow was necessarily low, the average flow being
(about) 1 c.c./$ hr. The method of collecting the urine by manual expression gives figures
of limited accuracy at this level, and although no tests have been made, it is felt that
variations of 10-20% in the rate of flow would probably have been overlooked. However,
in ten of the twelve experiments, the urine flow remained apparently unaffected by the

stimulus; in the other two cases an increase of flow to 2-2 c.c./} hr. (rabbit 17), and
6-8 c.c./} hr. (rabbit 20) were seen. The significance of these two cases is rendered doubtful
by the fact that out of four control experiments in which ‘mock stimulation’ was performed,
a similar rise was observed in one case.

It is concluded that in the conscious rabbit, stimulation of the neurohypophysis does not
cause a hyperglycaemia or a diuresis, and since the electrode tip in these rabbits was
partly in the pars distalis (rabbits 17, 20, 21) and partly in the pars tuberalis (rabbit 17)
also, it seems likely that acute stimulation of these regions also fails to cause a hypergly-
caemia or diuresis. These results do not agree with those of previous observers, and it is
felt that the difference may be accounted for satisfactorily by the fact that the earlier work
was conducted on animals anaesthetized with ether (Weed et al. 1913; Keeton & Becht
1916) and pentobarbital sodium (Ingram & Barris 1935).
