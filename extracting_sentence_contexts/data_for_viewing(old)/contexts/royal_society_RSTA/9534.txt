constituent of the alloy Al 28 at the summit D of the liquidus. D may very well be
the compound Al,Au,; it is very constant in appearance in all the alloys from Al 18
to Al 28, in which we have studied it, and from the fact that second freezing-points
occur along the line Cd to a point almost under the summit D of the liquidus it does
not appear probable that D is a solid solution.

The diagram ends at 400° C., and all alloys considered in it are supposed to have
been melted, cooled to a temperature not below 400° C., and chilled. This limitation
is important, as alloys cooled below 400° C., even if afterwards heated, generally
require another diagram,
