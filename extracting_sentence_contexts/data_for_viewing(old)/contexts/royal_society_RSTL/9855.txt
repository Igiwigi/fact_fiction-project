OF THE FOSSIL PLANTS OF THE COAL-MEASURBS. 291

where, instead of being detached from the medullary vascular cylinder, the boundary
between the two was only indicated in the transverse section by two slight lateral
construetions in the otherwise unbroken circle of vessels. Other sections of the
same 8pecimen in Mr. Ar1rKEN's cabinet exhibit similar conditions. We have here
a clear proof that, contrary to the conelusions of M. RexAvuLT, age does bring about
very important changes in the form and arrangement of the tissues in the branches of
these plants. Other examples of stems in a very much younger state, for which
I am indebted to Mr. ArmKEN and Mr. Cazn, exhibit corresponding phenomena.

My most recent researches have brought to light another very remarkable series of
facts indicating the Lycopodiaceous character of the Lepidodendroid and Sigillarian
stems. Whatever els& may be doubtful, there is no doubt that Stigmaria ficoides,
with its peculiar rootlets, is the root alike of Lepidodendron and of Sigillaria. IT had
long noticed the cireumstance that the vascular bundle in euch of these rootlets was
rarely in the centre of the small innermost circle of cortical cells by which it is usually
gurrounded ; but such structures are 80 often pushed out of their normal position in
these fossil plants that I regarded this eccentric position of the rootlet bundle as
accidental. The perusal of a very important paper by M. Pu. Vax Tizcnrn,* first
called my attention to a peculiarity in the structure of the true roots of the Lycopods,
especially of the Selaginellece, and led me to re-examine the rootlets of Stigmaria
with the results to be described. M. Vax TrizGneM has shown that when a rootlet
belonging to auy class of plants is first formed its primitive vascular elements commence
by developing a small vascular bundle at each of two or more points on the periphery
