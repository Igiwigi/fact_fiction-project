Then, in figure 10b-d, we
show the oscillation frequencies for yp = 0.04 and F = 0.01, F=0.1 and F =0.14, respectively. We
can appreciate that as the forcing amplitude grows, the oscillation frequencies are restored to the
no-damping case. In fact, in figure 10b, the frequencies are nothing similar to the non-damping
case. On the other hand, in figure 10c, the frequencies curve is almost restored, except for some
boundary t values that are related to the zones of the region on the parameter space in which
there still remains some fractalization. Finally, figure 10d shows that the oscillation frequencies
return close to the values of no-damping case.
