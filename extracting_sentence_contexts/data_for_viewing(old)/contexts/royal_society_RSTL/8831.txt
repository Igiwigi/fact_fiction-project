basement membrane, the epithelium being apparently eaten away at its lower extremity
by the round cells. If the section be a favourable one, and very deeply stained, it will
be seen that processes from the dark line on which the epithelium appears to rest run
up between the epithelial cells; and where this is the case the epithelium which covers
the follicle contains a tissue similar to that found within the follicles. (Identical appear-
ances are met with in the epithelium covering the follicles of the tonsil*.) Thus we
find that the epithelium contains a tisswe consisting of a reticulum containing in its
meshes lymph-corpuscles.

If, now, sections of the epithelium covering the villi or the yillus-like processes of
the large intestine be examined in any animal, it will easily be seen that the epithelium
contains lymph-corpuscles similar to those in the follicles (see fig. 13). It is specially
easy to demonstrate this fact in the intestine of the rabbit and sheep. In preparations
treated by chromic acid and stained in hamatoxylin, these cells are seen to consist of a
small zone of unstained protoplasm surrounding a very deeply stained spherical nucleus.
tn the following pages T intend to apply the term <lymph-corpuscles ” only to these cells.

Again, if the villi of a recently killed rabbit be examined (either in the fresh state, in
ſaline s0lution of three quarters per cent., with the addition of weak acetic acid, or after
having remained in one per cent. bichromate of potash from two to six days), it is easy
to show that the lymph-corpuscles are scattered everywhere among the intestinal epi-
thelium ; and it is equally easy to show, if the epithelial cells be separated from one
another by teasing, that the lymph-corpuscles are not found within the epithelial cells,
but lie between them. Thus Arxsrely (40) was mistaken in supposing that these cor-
puscles were eyer contained within the epitheliumF.
