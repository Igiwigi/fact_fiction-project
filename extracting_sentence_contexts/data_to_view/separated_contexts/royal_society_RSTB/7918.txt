This phylum, which
comes off from the main stock at the bottom of the zone of M. cortestudinarium, comprises
the forms which are placed in the species M. senonensis. It goes on, evolving parallel
to the main stock, until it disappears in the zone of Marsupites. If Micraster senonensis
were more common, the fact that it is not found below the base of the zone of M. cor-
testudinarium, i.e. it is confined to the Senonian, might be of practical use to the field
geologist. As both M. corbovis and M. senonensis intergrade with their contemporaries of the main
phylum, it is almost certain that interbreeding took place between the main and the
branch phyla. â€˜This would be disadvantageous to both the stocks in which it took place
by hindering them from becoming fully adapted to their environments. In addition,
poorly adapted transitional forms would be produced.
