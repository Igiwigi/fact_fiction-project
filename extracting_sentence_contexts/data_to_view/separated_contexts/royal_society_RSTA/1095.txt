Practically, Q(y, ~) as a function of two : S
variables was constructed on a 64 x 64 equidistant grid in a domain (0,2z) x (0,27). [fF

Note that determination of the respiratory phase y is simple: since the respiratory signal looks : a
like a modulated and slightly distorted sine-wave, its phase can be easily estimated, e.g. by means : =
of the Hilbert transform. On the contrary, the ECG signal has a quite complicated form and : =
computations of its phase represent a non-trivial stand-alone problem, see [15]: here one needs 1B
very high-quality data, and its processing is technically quite demanding. This fact motivates : =
a development of techniques operating only with point processes, namely with instants of the 8
R-peaks, corresponding to the peak of depolarization of the ventricles of the human heart. These if
events can be easily detected and therefore are commonly used in the analysis of HRV. Since these : |
peaks appear once per heartbeat cycle, their continuous phase ¢ without loss of generality can be : §
set to zero. a

First, we discuss how the disentanglement of the HRV can be performed if both continuous 18

phases g(t) and w(t) are available [15].
