Another example is afforded by a condenser with
terminals connected to two points in the circuit. The plates of the condenser are
E then virtually parts of the circuit.
} The effect of a junction of two wires, say of the same diameter, but of different
= gpecific resistances, upon the level surface will resemble that of a charge upon the
Soeparating surface. This can be seen in a general way from the fact that the level
S 8urfaces must cut the wire with the higher speecific resistance at intervals shorter than
.& those at which it cuts the other wire.
2 Tf there be an insulated conducting body, say a metal sphere, near the circuit, we
'S know that in the steady state there is no electric intensity, and therefore no current
within it ; consequently there is no movement of energy and no movement of
> induction through it. We can see how this condition is arrived at. As the first
= tubes of electric and magnetic induction come up to the sphere they will enter it, and
2 the parts of the electric induction tubes thus entering will be broken up, causing a
Z transient current in the s8phere.
