potassium. 'This examination has led to the discovery of a singular class of com-
pounds, which form the subject of the present memoir.

The previous knowledge on the action of nitric acid on the prussides may be
snmmed up very briefly. Txomson* examined the gases produced during the action,
and recognized them to be nitrogen, cyanogen, nitric oxide, and carbonic acid, while
the residue was believed to consist of pernitrate of iron and nitrate of potash.
DosxreINERrF remarked that previous to the complete decomposition of the prus-
sides, a strong coffee-colonred liquid was produced, which, after neutralization,
precipitated protosalts of iron of a dark blue colour. GmeLin{, to whom chemistry
was already indebted for important discoveries in the prussides, observed that the
coffee-coloured liquid noticed by DosgreINER was rendered of a magnificent purple
or blue colour on the addition of an alkaline sulphide. The same fact was noted by
Mr. Mzrcery of Oakenshaw, without his being aware that it had already been re-
marked by Gmztin. CamrBELlL||, in repeating GMeLN's experiment, threw out the
intelligent suggestion that the purple colour might be due to the production of a
sulphuret of nitrogen, which Grecony Â© had already remarked produced an ame-
thystine colour when mixed with an alcoholic solution of potash. Smez**, in an
examination of the action of nitric acid on the prussides, observes that ferrideyanide
is produced, nitric oxide being evolved.

I am not aware of any further knowledge on this subject ; and as it is far from
being sufficiently extended, a new examination was desirable.
