to exhibit the dangerous failure characteristics well known in buckling of thin shells...
Optimization thus leads to buckling instabilities, but worse is to come... In a structure
of any appreciable complexity optimization seems to call for simultaneity of failure loads,
and this is becoming a significant feature in the design of large composite structures.
Unfortunately the coupling of even apparently unrelated and harmless failures can give
rise to severe shell-type instability. . .

Besides, Thompson & Hunt [40] observe ‘that an optimum design is by its very nature
imperfection-sensitive, since any deviation from the idealized optimum design must yield a lower
failure bound’.


Thus, despite the fact that ‘the ethics of our profession today does not allow any design for a
structure without optimization’ [41], one should proceed with extreme caution, as Michael and
his co-workers showed. The answer to the extreme question [42], ‘Shall we abandon optimization
theory?’ should be in the negative, as was substantiated by Ohsaki & Ikeda [43]. These authors
specifically showed that ‘imperfection sensitivity law varies according to the type of a critical
point, and coincident critical points are not always imperfection-sensitive. The sensitivity is severe
for semi-symmetric and completely symmetric bifurcation points, but is less severe for a hilltop
branching point’. In the book by Elishakoff & Ohsaki [44], the authors advocate the idea that for
uncertainty and optimization not to remain purely academic concepts, they ought to be combined
with anti-optimization, or with a search procedure for worst scenarios under uncertainty.

And as uncertainty has been mentioned, I would like to quote from Hunt & Virgin [45]:
