united into a flat shell, hidden in the * mantle,” which is pierced by the apertures for the tentacles and gills.
The dispoxition of the calcareous particles in the Doride is very regular, though it seems too much to aszume
with Lovtx that they imitate a subspiral shell (zee Lovix, Oxex's Isis, 1842).

+ The memoir by Dr. GzcGexnaus, © Beitrige zur Entwickelungsgeschichte der Land Gasteropoden,” which
has just appeared in SrenorD and KGclIkER's * Zeitschrift fiir Wissenschaftliche Zoologie,” furnishes very
powerful support to the doubts above suggested, eince it demonstrates that the shell of Clausilia, and gives
good reason for believing that that of Heliz, are developed within the substance of the mantle, following exactly
the type of Limaz.

© The land Gasteropoda are distinguished by the peculiar mode of development of their hell, if we may draw
eonclusions for the whole group from Heliz and Clausilia. The original depoxition of the shell in the interior
of the mantle (as in the Loligide among the Cephalopoda) is as yet an isolated fact among the land Gastero-
poda, of which we find no indication in other Gasteropods.”

There seems to be a very curious relation between the internal or external nature of a hell, the curvature of
its whorls as regards a vertical plane, and the hzmal or dorsal flexure of the intestine.

Take, first, the case of a true external shell, as that of Nautilus or Argonauta, or Atlanta. Here the direction


50 MR. T. H, HUXLEY ON THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE CEPHALOUS MOLLUSCA.

From all that bas been stated, I think that it is now possible to form a notion of
the archetype of the Cephalous Mollusca, and I beg it to be understood that in using
