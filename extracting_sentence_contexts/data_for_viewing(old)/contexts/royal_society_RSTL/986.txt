tained an increase of volume = 40 parts ; it burned with the
pale flame of hydrogen; and when detonated over mercury
required scarcely more than half its volume of oxygen, and
afforded a very minute portion of carbonic acid. The interior
of the platinum tube was lined with charcoal, the crystals
were covered with it, and some had assumed a beautiful
brown tint.

4. The conclusions drawn from the last experiment are
founded upon the supposition, that olefiant gas is decomposed
bythe simple operation of a high temperature, and that one
volume is resolved into two volumes of hydrogen, losing at
the same time its carbon. The importance of this fact, as con-
nected with these researches, induced me to repeat with every
requisite precaution, the beautiful experiment of M. Ber-
THOLLET, Which consists in decomposing this gas by passing
it repeatedly through a red hot earthen tube; instead of
which, however, I employed a tube of platinum, arranged as
in the last experiment, increasing the heated surface by the
introduction of quartz crystals. One hundred measures of
olefiant gas,* obtained by distilling alcohol with sulphuric
acid, were passed and repassed through the tube heated -to
high redness, until they ceased to dilate : when the apparatus
was cool, the volume of gas was almost exactly doubled ;
there was a copious deposition of charcoal in the part of the
