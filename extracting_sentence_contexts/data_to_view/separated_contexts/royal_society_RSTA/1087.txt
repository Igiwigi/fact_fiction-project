Within this
range the dispersion is therefore apparently normal, since the rotations increase
progressively with decreasing wave-length; but this is only because the anomalies

have been displaced to longer wave-lengths. This conclusion was confirmed by the
fact that a reversal of sign was detected in the methylene bornyl ester, IV, at about
7000 A., where a zero reading was observed, whilst a small positive rotation, « = 0:06,
[x] = 0-2, was observed at about 7100 A., using a carbon arc as a source of red light. In the region of absorption, however, the curves of rotatory dispersion are of just the
same type as those referred to above. (d)
