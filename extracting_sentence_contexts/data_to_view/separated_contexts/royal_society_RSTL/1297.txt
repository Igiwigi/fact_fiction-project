mixed with a certain portion of animal matter, which was se-
parated and floated under a membrane-like form, on the

Z lishes the same fact by its semi-transparent appearance, and
Y regular prismatic crystals of the triple salt, discoverable by a

E done by the operation. By this examination they were found
E, less fusible than the general mass, and appeared to contain a
ES larger proportion of phosphat of lime, for by admixture of a
