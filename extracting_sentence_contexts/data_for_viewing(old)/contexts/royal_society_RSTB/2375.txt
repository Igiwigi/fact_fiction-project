Iw a former paper* we have shown that in the disease called General Paralysis of the
Insane the degenerative changes that occur in the central nervous system are
associated with the presence of the products of such degeneration in the cerebro-
spinal fluid. We specially investigated one of these products, namely, choline, which
is derived from the breakdown of lecithin ; but we also noted that there are others, for
instance, nucleo-proteid. Choline can be identified in the blood also of these patients,
The tests on which we rely for the detection of this alkaloid are mainly two: the first
is a chemical test, namely, the obtaining of the typical yellow octahedral crystals from
the alcoholic extract of the blood. These crystals have not only a definite form, but
their solubilities distinguish them from other somewhat similar crystals, as also does
the fact that they yield a fixed percentage of platinum, and give rise to an odour of
trimethylamine when decomposed by heat. The second test is a physiological one: a
saline solution of choline, of choline hydrochloride, and of the residue obtained from

the alcoholic extract of the cerebro-spinal fluid, and blood of these patients, produce a

temporary fall of pressure when injected intravenously in animals. This fall is partly

cardiac in origin, and partly due to dilatation of peripheral blood-vessels; the

dilatation is due to the direct action of the alkaloid on the neuro-muscular mechanism

of the blood-vessels themselves, There are many substances which produce a fall of
