ceeds more quickly (e.g. [26]). One intriguing response
to this mismatch, suggested by Schapiro [38] is that the
hippocampus may be more prominently involved in some
aspects of distributional statistical learning.

Another possibility is that conditional and distributional
statistical learning arise from different potential encodings
of the input [27]. Sensitivity to transitional probabilities
arises, from this perspective, when participants encode the
input in terms of chains of elements (e.g. A-B-C). This kind
of encoding is insensitive to the position at which each
element occurs, and instead represents only their serial
order (the fact that A preceded B, irrespective of which absol-
ute position that occurred in). Sensitivity to distributional
information may arise when participants encode the absolute
position of items in the sequence (especially first and last
position), an encoding that is easier when there are breaks
or pauses in the input that provide cues to element bound-
aries. Together, McClelland ef al.’s [52] and Endress &
Bonatti’s [27] approaches highlight two important distinc-
tions within the memory system—neurological substrate
and encoding—that may explain distinctions within statisti-
cal learning. But note that not only are there several
possible variations on neurological substrate (e.g. differential
function within the hippocampus; e.g. [94]) and on possible
