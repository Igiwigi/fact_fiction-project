other cyclical only after having been at first spiral—were constantly presented in well-
marked contrast with each other, there would be good ground for considering them
(as Professor W1LL1amsoN has done*) to be characteristic of distinct specific types.
But this idea cannot be entertained, when a large number of individuals are examined.
For it then becomes apparent, that the number of cases in which the nucleus is
surrounded on all sides by the same number of zones, indicating that the concentric
mode of growth has prevailed from the very first, are very few; but that in by far
the larger proportion of specimens, there is a slight excentricity of the nucleus, with
a larger number of zones on one side than on the other, as in Plate IX. figs. 1, 3;
indicating that the first-formed zones have been incomplete circles, owing to a
restriction of the gemmation of the nucleus to one part of its periphery. This is
shown extremely well by decalcified specimens of the animal, no two of which, in
fact, precisely resemble one another as to the mode in which the first zone of segments
originates in the nucleus. Thus in the specimen represented in Plate IV. fig. 1, of
which the nucleus is represented on a larger scale in fig. 12, the circumambient
segment of the nucleus gives off only Zhree stolons, at the end most remote from its
connexion with the central mass; and the first zone of segments is far from being

entire, the cyclical type not being completely attained until two or three successive
additions have been made. In fig. 13, eight stolons are given off from the nucleus;
and from the half-zone which they form, an entire circle is next produced ; thns
affording a remarkable confirmation to the idea I have already suggested («| 37.), as
to the capacity of a portion of a zone to give origin to a complete annulus, by the

lateral extension of its bands of sarcode. In fig. 10, the nucleus gives off eleven
