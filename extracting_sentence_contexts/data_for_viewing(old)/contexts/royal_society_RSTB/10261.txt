Figure 3. (a) BOLD and DA responses to reward prediction errors (RPEs). (i) BOLD response to positive (green trace, N = 5143) and negative (red trace, NW = 5591)
RPEs. A star represents difference significant at p < .05, FWER corrected, two-tailed. (ii) DA response to positive (green trace, W = 1018) and negative (red trace,
N = 991) RPEs. Differences p > .05, FWER corrected, two-tailed. (b) BOLD and DA responses RPEs with BET greater than or equal to 0.9. (i) Bold response to
positive (green trace, N = 675) and negative (red trace, N = 679) RPEs and BET greater than or equal to 0.9. A star represents difference significant at p < .05,
FWER corrected, two-tailed. (ii) DA response to positive (green trace, N = 238) and negative (red trace, N = 216) RPEs with BET greater than or equal to 0.9. A star
fepresents difference significant at p < .05, FWER corrected, two-tailed.

coordinates with radius 5 mm and sampled into the space of the (n) BOLD analysis
functional images. These coordinates were the peak-activation
coordinates in L/R caudate, L/R ventral striatum/putamen for
fictive error and RPE from [25]. A time series was formed for
each ROI by averaging the functional images over this mask.
Subjects were selected sequentially and assigned an ROI so
that the proportions of the four ROIs represented were the
same as in the DA subjects (see the electronic supplementary
material). Snippets of time series anchored on the Reveal event

For plotting and analysis, the extracted BOLD time series were
further reduced to values at nine time points (2s before reveal,
14s after). For plotting, the series were binned according to the be-
havioural variables. For statistical analysis, the data were pooled
across subjects and the BOLD values from 4, 6, 8 s were used and
entered (in the same manner as for the DA series) into a two-factor
