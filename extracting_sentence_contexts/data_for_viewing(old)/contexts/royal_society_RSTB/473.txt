spaces at the ends of the tubes (seen in the preceding sections) a part of the pericardial
space. In other words, the spaces separated off from the rest of the body-cavity by
the pericardial membrane are, (1) in the greater part of the segment, a triangular space
enclosing the heart, and (2) in the region of the organ, the same space and all the
spaces in the overlapping part of the dorsal shield round the organ. All these spaces
are in communication with one another and are separate from the rest of the body-
cavity.

The next figure (fig. 6) shows a section anterior to the last. The tissues of the organ
have quite disappeared, and in their place is a space occupied on each side by the two
masses of fat body, which were shown in the last figure, and which are now enclosed by
the pericardial membrane. The space marked ext. sp., shows that the overlapping
part of the dorsal scale is almost past. It is, in fact, the remnant of the space that in
the posterior sections divided the overlapping portion of the dorsal scale from the rest

of the body.

In fig. 7 the main part of the segment is reached and the organ is no longer present.
The fat bodies are within the pericardium and the blood corpuscles are passing from
them to the ostium of the heart round which they are clustered so as to hide it. The
