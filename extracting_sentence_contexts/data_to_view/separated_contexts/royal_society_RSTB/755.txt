The general rule appears to be, as Mivarr states, that uncinates are present on the
cervico-thoracic and on the first six thoracic ribs, but the short cervico-thoracic ribs of
the skeleton of A. australis referred to above (p. 83) are devoid of those appendages,
which are also absent on one side in another skeleton examined. OweEN also states
that they are absent in the specimen first examined by him. The occasional absence
of the cervico-thoracic uncinates, taken in connection with the vestigial condition of
the ribs in one case, and with the fact that in the same skeleton the first thoracic rib
of the right side terminates ventrad in a blunt free end and has no sternal portion,
seems to point to an inclusion of anterior thoracic vertebrae in the cervical region by
atrophy of their ribs. 8. THe STERNUM.
