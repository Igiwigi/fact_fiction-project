fixed concentration of solute and the solvent, current density values were varied and optimized.
Next, keeping the optimized current density constant, the molar concentration was varied
and optimized. Keeping the optimized current density and the optimized molar concentration
constant, two solvents were used and an optimum was selected. The optimization was based on
hexadecane CA and TA, and surface morphologies. As before, the angles reported in the figure
are after the surfaces have been coated with fluorosilane.

In 0.2M solution, at a lower current density, 0.25 Acm~?, and 5V, the oleophilic surface with
hexadecane CA 80° becomes more oleophilic with hexadecane of about CA 10°. This is also in
agreement with the theory discussed in the previous pathway. However, on increasing the current
density further, the hexadecane CA starts to pick up and reach about 100° at 0.75 Acm™?, 15 V. It
was attempted to go beyond the current density value; however, the surface edges had started to
lose their structural integrity. This was owing to the fact that non-uniform pitting had occurred
across the surface with the number of pits being denser near the edges. Additionally, increasing
the current density made the situation worse leading to complete dissolution of the edges. As
discussed earlier, lowering the solute ion concentration results in fewer pitting sites and a larger
current density results in larger pits. Therefore, it was determined that the molar concentration
chosen for the anodization was not enough.

Keeping the current density constant at 0.75Acm~?, the solute concentration was varied
between 0.2 and 0.4M. For 0.3M, there was an improvement in pitting uniformity and in the
wettability. The surface had turned superhydrophobic without the fluorosilane coating. It had
water CA of about 165° and TA of about 5°. And with the fluorosilane coating, the surface had
become superoleophobic with hexadecane CA of about 155° and TA of about 5°. The changing of
