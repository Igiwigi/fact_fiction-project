SYNGE ON THE TIGHTNESS OF THE TEETH. 461

If, as before, we suppose that a single transverse force Y is applied at the biting edge
of the upper central tooth, we are to put

N = ep¥ = 1-80aY ;
hence the following result is a consequence of (91) :

TuEorEM XIV.—The distribution of pressure in the membrane of the wedge-shaped
model of the upper central tooth, under the application of a transverse force of Y lbs. at
the biting edge, is given in lbs. per sq. in. by the formula

p=P + 0002 (1 — =) (20-46), Peretti est toa)

where the dual sign is to be interpreted as in Theorem XI. We note that the pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure, not only at the
margin of the membrane and at the apex, but also at the points for which « = 0-46a,
a value which is, of course, independent of the values of Y and P. There are four points of maximum and minimum pressure, namely, those points
for which

x = 0°784 = 0°38 in., 2=0°20a=0:10in,. ..... (95)

It is easy to distinguish the maxima from the minima by the fact that at a maximum
the tooth approaches the socket as a result of the displacement, which is a rotation
about a point close to the middle point of the axis of the root. In fig. 8, M,, My are

Fia. 8.

the points of maximum pressure and My, M, are the points of minimum pressure. We obtain the following values :—

Pressure at M, = P + 33Y Ibs. per sq. in. ;
Pressure at Mz = P — 25Y Ibs. per sq. in. ;
Pressure at M,; = P + 25Y lbs. per sq. in. ;
Pressure at M, = P — 33Y Ibs. per sq. in.
