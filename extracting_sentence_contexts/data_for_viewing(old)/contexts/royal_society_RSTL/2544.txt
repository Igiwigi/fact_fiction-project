At Madras, in a lower latitude than Poona, at the level of the sea, I have shown it
to be only 0790; whilst at Calcutta, in a higher latitude than Poona, the means of
three years make it *1100. Proceeding to higher levels, however, we find a marked
diminution in the extent of the diurnal tide. At Mahabuleshwur, at 4500 feet, the
means of eight months reduce the oscillation to 0694 ; at Hurreechundurghur, at
3900 feet, the oscillation for the three hottest months was 0969 ; whilst at Kota-
gherry, at 6407 feet, it was for five months from noon to sunset only 0498. The oscil-
lation at Mababuleshwur, at 4500 feet, was in fact /ess than HumBorLpT's oscillation
at Mexico of 0708 at nearly 7000 feet.

When we pass to the other tides we find the same puzzling anomalies. The mean
rise from 8unrise to 9â€”10 a.v., whether at Hurreechundurghur, at Mahabuleshwur,
or Kotagherry, instead of being less than at Poona, is in fact greater. The mean of
three years on the level of Poona gives :0445, whilst the first place gives *0488, the
second place 0476, and the last 0490. The maximum night tide, on the contrary,

is infinitely greater at Poona than at Mahabuleshwur or Kotagherry (it was not de-
termined at Hurreechundurghur), being 0884 at Poona, 0439 at Mahabuleshwaur,
and 0430 at Kotagherry. The fourth or minimum nocturnal tide occurring in the
dead of night, has been rarely observed at the exact a.m. limit hour ; but the obser-
