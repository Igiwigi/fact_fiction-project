We may therefore take 300 kilometres as an outside
limit for e, giving the value of 10- as the lower limit for the conductivity. This
no doubt is a high value, and there may be some hesitation in accepting it as a
possible one. Mr. C. T. R. Wrtson has, however, already drawn attention to the
fact that at high altitudes we must, with the same ionising power, expect a much
increased conductivity, for the ionic velocity due to unit difference of potential varies
inversely with the pressure. If, further, as the experiments indicate, the ionising
power and rate of recombination of ions both diminish directly as the pressure, it
would follow that when the pressure is only the millionth part of an atmosphere the
conductivity should be for the same ionisation a million times as great as at the surface
of the earth. Researches on the conductivity of gases generally give relative measures, so that it
is not always easy to infer its value in C.G.S. units, but I think the following
examples will give an idea of the order of magnitude involved.
