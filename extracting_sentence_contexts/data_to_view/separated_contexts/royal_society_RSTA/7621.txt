For a particular
monthly mean value of cloud amount we have taken the average of the readings
at all the hours of observation available to us. There is a high negative correlation between sunshine duration and cloud
amount, the coefficients for anomalies taken during the same month being respec-
tively

0-74, —0-85, —0-84, —0-72 (n = 85)
for the four quarters of the year, at Douglas, and
—0-82, —0-89, —0-88, —0-65 (n= 24)

for the four quarters of the year, at Southport. This correlation corresponds to the
fact that corresponding significant entries in Tables XII and XIII have opposite
signs.
