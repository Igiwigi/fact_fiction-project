For the very short composite segment which thus intervenes between the second
pouch and the sinus-ectoderm, we adopt the designation suggested by Hammar (22)
viz. ductus ecto-entobranchialis IJ. The corresponding structure in the pig (Zorrer-
MAN, 69, p. 527) and guinea-pig (RupEN, 50, p. 591) differs from that of Trichosurus
mainly in the fact that the union of its two constituent parts is not of such a
markedly overlapping character as in Trichosurus, but is more of the nature of an end-
to-end junction. In Stage VI (embryo of G.L. 7:75 mm.), the walls of the dorso-cranial angle of the
- sinus proper, with which the ductus ecto-entobranchialis is continuous, have become
thickened and fused together to form a solid mass which is the first indication of the
primordium of the cervical thymus (Plate 4, fig. 15, s.tm.).
