A remark, that putting z=0, we have

E VP+2fYZ+P=—pPA(fY +2).

Sand hence writing 1 for Y, and —1, —@, —«? for Z, we have
Bpo=2f=—1PA(p—2), b+anMef=—p (fot), b+oo—2af=— Af —a/S);
Zand hence the product of the three factors is —y%%(4*—2?(y*—o*2)(y*—w*z?)*, which is
equal to =z/2(x*—2#)(y*+2)?, which yanishes in virtue of the assumed equation x=0.
HThis shows that the function 6+ — 8f* + 6bef contains the factor x. IT have not veri-
Sfied @ posterioni, but T assume it to be true, that it contains in fact the factor a*, and con-
quently that the expressions for ,, y,, 2, are rational and integral functions of (@, y, 2)
Sof the degree 25, and containing respectively the factors #, y, 2.

AQ 46. In the theory of the cubic, a point which depends linearly upon a given point
may be termed a derivative of s8uch point. According to a very beautiful theorem of
Profexsor SyLVvEsTER's, the coordinates of a derivative point are necessarily rational and
integral functions of « 8quare degree of the coordinates (@, 9, 2) of the given point; and
moreover, there is but one derivative point having its coordinates of any given square
degree m?, or, as we may express it, only one derivative point of the degree m2. The
successive tangentials are derivative points of the degrees 4, 16, 64, &c.; the third point
of intersection with the cubic, of the line joining two derivative points of the degrees
mn and n? respectively, is a derivative point of the degree (m+n)*. Thus the third point
