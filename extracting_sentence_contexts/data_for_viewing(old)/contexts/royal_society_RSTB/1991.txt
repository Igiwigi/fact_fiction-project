228 MR. W. H. LANG ON APOGAMY AND THE DEVELOPMENT

This opinion is not inconsistent with the occurrence of apospory in Mosses, which will
be considered later.

(2.) The Normal Life-Histories of Pteridophyta.

These afford little evidence in support of one or the other theory of the nature of |
alternation. On the homologous theory some rudiment of the sexual stage might be
looked for during the development of the sporophyte. The facts of ontogeny mostly.
afford merely negative evidence, though the “ Analogy between the young asexual
generation and the sexual generation ”* in Lycopodium cernwum pointed out by Treus,
may be explained in this way.

(3.) Abnormal Modes of Reproduction in Pteridophyta and Bryophyta.

Apogamy and apospory are the most important phenomena which come under
this head. The former is known only in Leptosporangiate Ferns, the latter in the
Mosses as well. Though conveniently considered together it does not follow that
the evidential weight to be attached to them is equal. Both are commonly regarded
as indicating that the distinction between the two generations is not a rigid one.
Beyond this, which is indeed nothing more than a statement of the facts, widely
