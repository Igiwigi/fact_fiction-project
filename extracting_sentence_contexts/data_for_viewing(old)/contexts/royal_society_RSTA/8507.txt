We first examine the possible standing oscillation maintained by the currents across
the northern section only, in the absence of the earth’s rotation. This is shown in
figs. 4 and 5, in which the currents and elevation-gradients respectively are at a maximum.

The positions of the nodes and loop depend on the distribution of depth, and in fact the
northern section proves to be a nodal line. The currents along and near the loop are
obtained by applying an extension of Atry’s rule, to the effect that a quarter of a period
before high water at any place the currents there are directed towards the shoals. But
the complexity of the distribution of depth makes the application of this rule rather
uncertain.

We next examine the effect of the earth’s rotation ; from T'AyLor’s work we are led
to suppose the results to be as indicated in figs. 6 and 7, which are to be superposed
on figs. 4 and 5 respectively. The tides may now be regarded as consisting of a wave
travelling round the sea in the positive direction and representing a progression of
energy. The effect of friction will be the continual dissipation of this energy, so that
the amplitudes on the east coast will be smaller than those on the west coast and this
