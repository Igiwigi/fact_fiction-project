The recent expenditure of conservation resources for our
cohort of bird species was shown to perform strikingly worse
than the optimal conservation protocol for maximal PD gain
with the same total available funds. This emphasizes the
need for effective, empirical evaluation of conservation project
investment and success using economic frameworks [51]. We
show that whether recent conservation efforts are maintained,
they are likely to achieve less than a quarter of the Aichi target
of improving the status of all species in this cohort [32]. Failure
to meet or even get close to this target reflects the limited
amount of resources available for conservation, and also the
poor distribution of those resources. In fact, our analysis illus-
trates that the amount of money spent on our cohort of 206 bird
species over the last decade should be sufficient to downlist 136
species recognized as the highest priorities for cost-effective PD
conservation in our ADEPD framework, enabling preservation
of levels of future PD to reach 88% of that associated with the
Aichi-like target outlined in our analysis. While there is a ques-
tion over what percentage of resources should be used to
allocate the remaining resources optimally, we have shown
that there is a very large difference between optimal and cur-
rent spending patterns and therefore that it may be worth
making some effort to reassess avian conservation activities
in order to move towards the optimal.
