The Raman spectrum (figure 7a) of the outer blue layer of sample VCO2 (figure 6, layer IV)
showed characteristic bands of lazurite at 545, 586, 807 and 1092cm~! [21], together with minor
bands at 626 and 967 cm~! attributed to wollastonite. The symmetric stretching vibration of S3~
radical anion at 545 cmâ„¢? is appreciable in the spectra of natural and artificial ultramarine but the
presence of bands of wollastonite is indicative of a natural pigment [20]. This fact together with
the presence of iron and magnesium in the SEM-EDS analysis of the surface blue layer of the
sample, attributable to pyrite and forsterite or diopside, suggests the use of a natural ultramarine
blue in the glazing of sample VC02. SEM-EDS analysis (table 1) of a blue crystal (figure 8a) in the blue-crystal layer (figure 6,
layer III) of sample VCO02 revealed the presence of silicon, potassium and cobalt, characteristic
of smalt, a potassium glass of blue colour owing to the addition of variable amounts of cobalt. Its composition is variable and it may contain other elements such as barium, calcium, sodium,
arsenic, magnesium, iron, nickel, copper and manganese [22].
