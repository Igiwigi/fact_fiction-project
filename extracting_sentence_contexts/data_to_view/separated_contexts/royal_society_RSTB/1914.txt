Tate two chief modifications of the normal course of the life-history of a feru,
aBogamy and apospory, are of interest in themselves, but have acquired a more
eStended importance from the possibility that their occurrence may aid in indicating
true relation between the sexual and spore-bearing generations, and so throw
Iiht on the nature of “alternation of generations” in archegoniate plants. This
sgpect has been recognised since the discovery of the phenomena, and will be best
w®preciated by tracing the progress of opinion on the nature of alternation from the
time of Hormerster to the present day. Only the more important contributions
Baring on the subject can be mentioned in this place.
— With the publication of the ‘ Vergleichende Untersuchungen’ (1851), the fact of
e regular alternation of a sexual with an asexual generation in the life-history of
ophyta, Pteridophyta, and Gymnosperms was established. HormersTer subse-
& ently extended the observation to Angiosperms. In the work mentioned, and in
e ‘Higher Cryptogamia,’ published some ten years later, no views as to the nature
@ alternation of generations are discussed.
