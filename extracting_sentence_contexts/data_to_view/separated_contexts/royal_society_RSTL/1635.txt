Ropr16uez's Observalions on the *

reduces all angles to the plane. of the horizon, and with such
a degree of correctness, that the, error in the sum of the three
angles of any triangle is scarcely, in any instance, found to
exceed three seconds of a degree, and in general not more
than a small fraction of a second. Accordingly the geodetical obseryations were conducted
with a degree of exactness, which hardly can be: exceeded;
and even if we suppose for a moment, that the chains made
use of in the measurement of the bases may-not admit of equal
precision with the rods of platina employed-in France, never-
theless, the degree of care employed in their construction;/ in
the mode of using them, and the pains taken to verify their
meagures was such, that no. error that. can have occurred-in
the length of the base, could make any perceptible difference
in the $ides of the series of triangles, of which the whole -ex-
tent does not amount to. s0. much as three degrees. Nevertheless, the results deduced by the author, from this
measure alone, would lead to the: supposition that the earth,
instead of being flattened at the poles, is in fact more- elevated
at that part than at the equator, or at, least, that-its surface- is
not that of a regular solid. For; the, measures of different
degrees on the meridian, as reduced; by.Lieut. Col.
