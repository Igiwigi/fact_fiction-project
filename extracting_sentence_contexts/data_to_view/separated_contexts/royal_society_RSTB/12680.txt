were under our second approach. We believe that this approach s
is the most realistic in that it reflects the temperature-dependent gq
nature b as supported by data, and it reflects the fact that this trait

is unlikely to evolve instantaneously (though it could be plastic). This approach predicts the greatest reductions in developmental
durations, particularly in high latitudes (see Results).

We used our estimate of how temperature affects the temperature species with aplanktonic development by between 1 and

dependency of the developmental mode to project how tempera-
ture increases will affect planktonic durations in the future. To
illustrate our results, we parametrized (equation (2.3)) to con-
sider two hypothetical species—a species with feeding larvae
and a species with non-feeding larvae, and set their developmen-
tal duration parameters as follows.
