The response may be very
powerful, although such as would be evoked by only a single stimulus, and this
even after the fish has been subjected to the squeeze treatment for a considerable
number of times. * This fact has become familiar to us,as to Du Bors-Reymonp, by
many prolonged experimental demonstrations, particularly those in which a large
number of people have successively obtained, by the same method, the discharge
through the hand, as for instance at the Conversazione of the Royal Society, and
that of the British Association at Ipswich, where living specimens of Malapterurus
were shown. An analysis of those reflex records in which the members of a group of responses
recur at the more rapid intervals, shows the following time interval between the
successive members of the group :—
