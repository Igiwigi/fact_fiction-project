This typically requires a large bath.

°Since system S and bath B can permanently exchange energy, subject to the constraint E7 = ES + E® =const., their
temperatures have to be defined as statistical averages with respect to the microcanonical density operator of the total
system T (see Sec. III.D in [8]).
