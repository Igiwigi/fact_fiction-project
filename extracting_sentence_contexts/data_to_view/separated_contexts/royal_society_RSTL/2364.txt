250 SIR HUMPHRY DAVY ON THE PHENOMENA OF VOLCANOES. The same circumstance which would give alloys of the metals of the earths
the power of producing volcanic phanomena, namely, their extreme facility of
oxidation, must likewise prevent them from ever being found in a pure com-
bustible state in the products of volcanic eruptions ; for before they reach the
external surface, they must not only be exposed to the air in the snbterrancan
cavities, but be propelled by steam ; which must possess, under the cireum-
stances, at least the same facility of oxidating them as air. Assuming the
hypothesis of the existence of such alloys of the metals of the earths as may
burn into lava in the interior, the whole phenomena may be easily explained
from the action of the water of the sea and air on those metals ; nor is there
any fact or any of the cireumstances which I have mentioned-in the preceding
part of this paper, which cannot be easily explained according to that hypo-
thesis. For almost all the volcanoes in the old world of considerable magnitude
are near, or at no considerable distance from the sea: and if it be assumed
that the first eruptions are produced by the action of sea water upon the metals
of the earths, and that considerable cavities are left by-the oxidated metals
thrown out as lava, the results of their action are such as might: be antici-
pated ; for after the first eruptions, the oxidations which produce the subse-
quent ones may take place in the caverns below the surface ; and when the
sea is distant, as in the yoleanoes of South America, they may be supplied
with water from great subterranean lakes ; as HumBorpr states that some of
them throw up quantities of fish. On the hypothesis of a chemical cause for yolcanic fires, and reasoning from
known facts, there appears to me no other adequate source than the oxidation
of the metals which form the bases of the earths and alkalies ; but it must not
be denied that considerations derived from thermometrical experiments on the
temperature of mines and of sources of hot water, render it probable that the
interior of the globe possesses a very high temperature : and the hypothesis of
the nucleus of the globe being composed of fluid matter, offers a still more
simple solution of the phenomena of yolcanic fires than that which has been
just developed.
