Specimens not so crushed (plate 33, figure 4) show that at least the penultimate three-
quarter whorl is inflated and possessed of a nearly vertical umbilical wall with bullae on
the edge, as in P. robiginosus (p. 574). The beginning of the last whorl of Neumayrâ€™s holo-
type, shown in his drawing as smooth and featureless, if undamaged would have had
a crater edge with bullae. The coiling and whorl development is, in fact, more like that of
Docidoceras cylindroides and some Bullatimorphites and Rugiferites of the Middle Bathonian
(cf. Arkell 1951-3, text-fig. 24). The diameter of the holotype, 110 mm, is about normal.
