ambulacrum (area 1) is, of course, situated mid-way between areas 2 and 5, and extends
over on to the most anterior part of the ventral surface.

Tue Post-LARvAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE TEST.

Fig. 5 is a diagram of the disarticulated test of an adult Hehinocardium, and brings
out clearly the bilateral symmetry of the animal. Viewed from the ventral surface
the outline of the test is ovate. The peristome is reniform, and situated considerably
nearer the anterior than the posterior end of the body, the flexible membrane possessing
a number of relatively small calcareous plates (Lovin, 1874, Plate XXXIX, fig. 225).
The slit-like mouth is situated at the posterior border of the buccal membrane, and is
partially concealed by a projecting lip (labrum). The five ambulacra appear to meet
round the mouth so as to exclude four of the inter-ambulacra. his is due to the fact
that the first (unpaired or peristomial) plate in inter-ambulacra 1, 2, 3 and 4 is greatly
reduced (fig. 5). That belonging to area 5 is also small, but forms the lip or labrum
already referred to.

The inter-ambulacra bear numerous, rather delicate, spines, those on the ventral
surface, notably those on the sternal plates (fig. 5, st.), being spatulate. When the spines
are removed, the plates are seen to bear numerous closely set tubercles of almost equal
size. These are somewhat larger in the neighbourhood of the peristome, and tend to
decrease towards the apical region. There is no distinction into primary, secondary,
and tertiary tubercles as in Hehinus (GorDON, 1926, p. 295). In each inter-radius,
plates 2a and 26 (those which succeed the unpaired one), are very large, those in the
unpaired inter-ambulacrum (5) being greatly lengthened in a radial direction (fig. 5, sÂ¢.).
