a means of formulating ideas concerning the coupling of
rotational and bending motion; a problem not unrelated
to Harry’s graduate work on the quasi-linear molecule
carbon suboxide, OCCCO. However, Harry was also
fascinated by the chemistry of the interstellar medium
(ISM), something that possibly originated from his earlier
interest in laboratory experiments on the structure of
C3, a quasi-linear molecule that had been detected in
comets [3].

A further link with the ISM came from the fact that
HC3N had also been detected in space [4] and Harry
questioned whether or not it might be possible to observe
some of the longer carbon chain molecules that he and
David Walton were making and investigating in the
laboratory [5,6]. A subsequent collaboration with Takeshi
Oka resulted in HC5N, HC7N and HCoN becoming some
