of the whole consumed, will be found finally stored up in the
increase of the animal. Of the mineral matter of the food, a less proportion still than
of the nitrogenous compounds, will, especially in the case of Pigs, be thus retained in the
increase. 4

It is not the province of the present Paper, nor are the facts applicable to such a pur-
pose, to consider the chemical and physiological changes undergone, or the offices 8ub-
served, by theâ€”say 95 per cent. of the consumed nitrogenous compounds in their pasage
through the system. But, it may be remarked, that from the form in which a large
proportion of them leaves the body, it is to be concluded that they must have entered
into its fluids, if not its solid structures, and therein been subjected to oxidation and trans
formation.
