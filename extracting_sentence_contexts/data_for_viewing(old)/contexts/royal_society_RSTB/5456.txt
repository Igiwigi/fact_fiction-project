lateral portion, should come to form the floor of an extra-cranial space (cavum epipteri-
cum) is easy to understand. ‘The cavum epiptericum itself is developed as an expanded
space accommodating the large trigeminal ganglion. In its expansion, this space has
extended laterally as far as the ala temporalis would allow, and since the skull-wall is
membranous in this region, it has bulged medially as well. In so doing, it has pushed
its way in over the trabecula, and may be said to rest upon it, much as in Selachians
the innermost part of the orbit “ rests ” on the subocular shelf.

The hindmost region of the cavum supracochleare is interesting, because it comes
into relation with the suprafacial commissure and the facial canal. ‘Che hindmost portion
of the cavum supracochleare is lodged between the suprafacial commissure on the inside
and the secondary facial foramen on the outside. That the suprafacial commissure
represents the true side wall is shown not only by the membranes, but also by the fact
that as soon as the facial nerve has emerged through it, its palatine branch (greater
superficial petrosal) separates from the main trunk and runs forwards and downwards,

into the sulcus facialis. The palatine branch thus slips out as it were between the two
