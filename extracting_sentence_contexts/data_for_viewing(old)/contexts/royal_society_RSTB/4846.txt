this loss of structural specialization is the appearance of functions not usually associated
with specialized cells, 7.e., motility and phagocytic power.

The dedifferentiation of the alveolar epithelium is thus functional as well as
structural.

Sometimes alveolar collapse is so marked in implants of adult ling, and the swelling
of the alveolar epithelium so general and synchronous, that comparatively few of the
cells can undergo detachment, owing to obliteration of the alveolar cavities. Such a
culture. in section, shows closely packed strands of rounded, oval or cubical cells of
large size and a not very deeply staining cytoplasm. Their character, in fact, is definitely
embryonic and indifferent—so much so that these cells would afford no clue to the
type of epithelium from which they were derived to one who had not followed the history
of their derivation. Adult lung, w vitro, rapidly dedifferentiates, and, in so doing, it
frequently passes through a stage in which its elements are strikingly “ foetal” in
appearance, owing to the small alveolar cavities and the thickened epithelial cells lining
them. This seems to be the pulmonary counterpart of reversed development described
by CHampy (8) in cultures of adult kidney. Degeneration, usually heralded by
pycnosis and karyorhexis, is often present, especially in the centre of cultures of adult
lung, owing largely, I imagine? to oxygen want. The process of dedifferentiation, how-
ever, is quite distinct from it, in time of onset, in the stages through which it passes,
and in appearance.
