and Sternberg in the early 1980s [1,2], using the so-called Thimm’s method of collective motions
[3], and which is related to the classical work of Gelfand and Cetlin in representation theory [4].
A result of Alekseev & Meinrenken [5] states that this system is also equivalent to an integrable
system found by Flaschka & Ratiu [6], via the so-called Ginzburg—Weinstein transformation.
Compared with many other integrable systems, especially those arising in classical mechanics
and physics (see, for example, [7,8]), the Gelfand—Cetlin system has some very special topological
and geometric properties:

— Its base space (i.e. the space of connected fibres of the momentum map), together with its
intrinsic affine structure, is a convex polytope, similar to the case of toric systems (whose
base spaces are the so-called Delzant polytopes [9]), even though the system is not toric.

— In fact, the Gelfand—Cetlin momentum map of the system (which consists of eigenvalue
functions of a chain of matrices) generates a toric action, but only on a dense open set of
the symplectic manifold in question. This momentum map is not globally smooth, though
it can be changed into a smooth momentum map with the same fibres (i.e. preimages)
by taking the symmetric functions of the eigenvalue functions. However, this smooth
momentum map does not generate a torus action.

— Unlike the toric case, where the singularities are all elliptic non-degenerate (in the sense of
Vey-Eliasson; see, for example, [8,10-13] for non-degenerate singularities), the Gelfand—
Cetlin system admits many degenerate singularities.

— The degenerate singular fibres of the Gelfand-Cetlin system are very peculiar in the
sense that they are all smooth isotropic submanifolds, as will be shown in this paper
