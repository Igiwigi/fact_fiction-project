Another species of inaccuracy originates in our conceiving
the fluxion of the lat. to vary as Tz, instead of a Tz; and it
may be useful to ascertain how much our conclusion is affected
by this circumstance. We suppose, in fact, that the incre-
ments of the lat. corresponding to the finite times gf and ge
are to each other as the areas gc and gb drawn into the co-
sine of the first lat. ; whereas, in strict propriety, they are to
each other as the sum of all the elements of these areas drawn
into the cosines of the latitudes belonging to each, z. e. (if ge
=m x gf )
