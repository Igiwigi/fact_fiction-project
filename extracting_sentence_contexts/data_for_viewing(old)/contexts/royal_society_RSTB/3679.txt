and interesting species should have been sacrificed to methods now out of date,
Nevertheless, however much we may deplore this waste of time and material, we
cannot fail to appreciate the fact that this author has at leastâ€™ attempted, for the first
time, a comparison of the vertebree of Onychaster with those of modern types.

We shall now describe the structure of the vertebrae and jaws, as it appears in
