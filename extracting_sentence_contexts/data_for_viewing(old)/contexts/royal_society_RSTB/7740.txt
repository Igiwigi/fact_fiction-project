into the deposits of No. 3 (the age sequence being 4-2-3), whereas Dr Tomlinson pictures
No. 3 passing up into No. 4 the full sequence being 3-4-2; and consequently she visualizes
the cold episode of No. 2 terrace separated from the Great Eastern Glaciation by a single
extended warm period, whereas Wills interposes it in the middle of the latter.

Along the upper Avon and Leam, the top of No. 3 appears to overlap the base of No. 4,
but its base is always separated by a rock step from the top of No. 2. I therefore support
the sequence of events suggested by Dr Tomlinson.

(g) No. 1 terrace

Although Dr Tomlinson did not map No. 1 terrace above Hampton Lucy and therefore
suggested the possibility that it passed beneath the alluvium, it is in fact apparent along
all the Avon from Warwick to Rugby (forming a feature from 5 to 10 ft. above the
alluvium) and even more strongly developed on the Leam-Itchen system. Frequently it
is in two stages, separated by a small step of 3 or 4 ft., and in such cases I have shown it on
figure 9 as 1a and 14; but I do not think there is any important difference in age between
the two levels, which may have resulted from the migration of meanders.

The terrace is not worked in any pits, though its gravels are visible in natural and
temporary exposures. Whereas it is separated from No. 2 by a rock step, its gravels abut
against the alluvium and indeed go below the level of the top of the latter; but they appear
to be wholly earlier than any of the alluvial fill and separated from this last stage by a down-
cutting amounting to about 25 ft. (measured from the top of 14). Several shallow bore-
holes recently put down east of Willes Bridge in Leamington (324658) to test the foundations
