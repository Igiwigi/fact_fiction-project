There then remained only the suggestion that the prominent
scales of Merino wool are responsible for the central halo which distinguishes the Mermo
photograph, but we have not at the moment confirmed this hypothesis on account of
the great difficulty of manipulating this fine and crimpy wool. Another point which might possibly be considered as an objection to the photographs
described here is that human hair and prepared wools have been subjected to soap-
scouring which might conceivably cause incipient hydrolysis of the protein and thus
produce false X-ray effects. That such a criticism is without weight is proved con-
clusively by the fact that the characteristic features of the Â«-photograph are independent
of whether there is any record of soap-scouring in the history of the fibres examined. For the human hair of fig. 1 soap-scouring must have been very frequent, and
it had also formed part of the preparation of the Cotswold wool of Plate 2, fig.
