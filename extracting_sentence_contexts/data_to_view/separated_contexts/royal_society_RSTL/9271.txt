Moreover, the conical is
not the only type of striz which can be successfully produced in this manner. Tt is
equally possible to form flat or annular strizz by proper adjustments of the air-spark
interval, as explained in page 192. And as these are precisely the forms which natural


k.

strize tend to assume when they deviate from the conical type, ib may be fairly stated
that all the forms of natural strizz can be artificially reproduced : a fact which is
strongly in favour of the identity of the two phenomena. But it is nob only in structure that these luminous shells resemble striz. There is
also an identity of function.
