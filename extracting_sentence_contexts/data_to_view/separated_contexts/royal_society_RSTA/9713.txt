Failing this force the pressures at A and C will be equalised in some-
what the same time that it will take for sound to travel along the unopposed line of
communication between A and Â©. At all events, the velocity should be of the same
order as that of sound. This statement hardly seems to me to require proof, but if it
does the following facts may be quoted. The wave of pressure produced by the erup-
tion of Krakatoa passed round the earth with the velocity of sound. On the equator,
where there is no possibility of any opposing force, there are hardly any appreciable
differences of pressure, save those due to the semi-diurnal pressure wave which travels
with a velocity of about four-thirds of that of sound.
