thermal history. The difference in NB aggregates between the two lenses is thus due to
sampling location.

Figure 2. Fluorescence topographs of the two diamonds. The images are collages made from individual micrographs recorded
using ultraviolet illumination in DiamondViewâ„¢. The contrast results from variations in the concentration of point defects for
material corresponding to different stages of octahedral growth. The topographs are very close to being mirror images of each
other. This suggests that the corresponding surfaces were originally coincident to one another in the same diamond and a cleave
has been made to separate them. The fact that the patterns are close to regular hexagons is consistent with a final cleavage being
made close to the centre of the stone.

The mirror-like symmetry observed in the fluorescence topographs and the birefringence show
conclusively that the diamonds came from the same crystal from adjacent crystallographic planes;
they are mating surfaces.

X-ray diffraction in the backscattering (Laue) geometry was carried out using a Photonic
Science intensified Laue X-ray imaging camera system with a Philips PW1830 X-ray generator
operating at 35kV and 35mA. The large facets of the crystal were aligned perpendicular to the
X-ray beam and the observed spot patterns indicated that the large facets of both diamonds
had orientations very close to {111}. With a detector-diamond distance of 31mm and with the
diamonds oriented with the (112) axis of the large facets aligned horizontally and perpendicular
