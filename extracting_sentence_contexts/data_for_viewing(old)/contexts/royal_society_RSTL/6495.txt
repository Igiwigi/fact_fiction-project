axes are parallel, and gives a diagram. At the present time they are neither in a line nor
parallel, but inclined at an angle of about sixteen degrees. The micrometer is employed
without illumination ; various contrivances were tried for illuminating the lines in a dark
field ; but the darkness was not absolute, and faint details were obliterated. We therefore
substituted bars for lines.

In the © Transactions* for 1850 are given Mr. JouNsToN STONEY'S Measures of H. 1622.
M. Orro STRUvE was good enough to send me measurements of the same spiral, and to

— direct my attention to the fact that Mr. SToxey's positions are about two degrees in
© eXCess. A little consideration made it evident that the construction of the universal
joint which supported the telescope was the cause of the error, and that a certain cor-
tection must be applied, depending upon the polar distance and the distance from the
meridian. Mr. Bixpox SToxgY's measures of IH. 1622 are also given, as also his mea-
sures of H. 2060, and STrUve's measures of both. As OrTro STRUVE'S measures are no
doubt as exact as possible, it will be easy to judge of the degree of dependence to be

As to the figured nebulce, little can be added to the information contained in the
general catalogue. Plates XXV. and XXIX. figures 7 and 35, are from sketches by
Mr. HuxTeR, but they had been previously sketched several times by others. We pre-
