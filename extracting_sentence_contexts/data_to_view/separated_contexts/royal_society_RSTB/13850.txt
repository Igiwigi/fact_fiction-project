Further personalization should also be informed by a patientâ€™s psycho-social history. For instance, the mechanism of
endocannabinoids seems to be dependent on stress and trauma history and can be affected by epigenetic modulation that
may be transmitted through trans-generational epigenetic inheritance [270]. Individuals with a trauma history may then
in fact self-medicate with cannabis [271,272] in order to treat an endocannabinoid-deficient state that impacts stress suscep-
tibility and may be especially amenable to treatment enhancing endocannabinoid tone [127]. Populations with significant
trauma history may also be uniquely impacted by modulation of the endocannabinoid system. For instance, Native Amer-
icans have altered 2-AG levels in the cerebrospinal fluid compared with Caucasians [273].
