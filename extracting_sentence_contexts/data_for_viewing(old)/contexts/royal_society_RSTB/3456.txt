side of the nucleus (figs. 68 and 69), This growth is certainly for the most part in a
downward direction. But the frequent occurrence of an irregular projection at the
micropylar end probably indicates that at first the cell elongates in both directions.
Since, in later stages, the micropylar end of the pro-embryo is always found in contact
with unbroken nucellar cells, it seems that the upward growth continues until a
point @appui is reached. A very similar projection at the micropylar end of the
elongating oospore of Gnetum Ginemon is described and figured by Lorsy.t The
cells at first lie entirely within the canal excavated by the pollen-tube and
embryo-sac-tube. In many cases the pro-embryo continues its course down the canal
formed by the embryo-sac-tube, which formerly brought the female nucleus which
has given rise to it. On the other hand, it frequently bores a new path through the
hitherto uninjured nucellar tissue: Gravity can have little if any influence upon its
direction of growth. Apart from the fact that the female cones, and with them the
ovules, are usually inclined at a considerable angle to the vertical, there are
circumstances in which the pro-embryo will grow directly upwards towards the
micropyle.{ This has been observed only in a few cases, in all of which fertilisation
has occurred above the line B (text-figure). It would seem therefore that the
direction of growth is determined mainly by conditions of nutrition and, further, the
downward course will usually be that of least resistance. It may be that oospores
situated near the micropyle are within the range of influence of the sugar left by the
drying up of the micropylar fluid.

As the cell elongates the nucleus moves downwards and, when not far from the
lower end of the tube, undergoes mitosis (figs. 68 and 69). At the conclusion of this
division a wall is formed, transverse to the axis, dividing the oospore into two cells,
