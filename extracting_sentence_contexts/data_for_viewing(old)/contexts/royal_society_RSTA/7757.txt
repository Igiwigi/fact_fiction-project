spheres, and the whole apparent displacement of the interatomic distance at the
moment of impact, occurring in connexion with a variation of temperature, is explained
as produced by such deviations. Since, however, R, is in reality a function of tempera-
ture, SUTHERLAND’s correction does not give us a correct interatomic distance, and the
atomic radius calculated according to SUTHERLAND has thus hardly any simple
physical significance. In view of this it is more correct, in calculating Rj, to employ
the uncorrected value of Ry, according to the kinetic theory or the corresponding un-
corrected value, calculated by the help of measurements of viscosity. These points
were stressed by the writer (WASASTJERNA 1923) already in 1923; the R, values, given
in Table V, have since been used in several papers (WASASTJERNA 1923, 1932¢, d).
These values are, however, very uncertain, which makes any further calculations
unreliable. It must be clearly realized that the calculations based on these figures do
not prove the truth of any theory, but rather only indicate that theory and facts, as

far as we can judge at present, are not conflicting.

As the calculated values of x, for A, Kr and X are almost identical we deal with
these three gases as a single group and thus take into consideration the two points
