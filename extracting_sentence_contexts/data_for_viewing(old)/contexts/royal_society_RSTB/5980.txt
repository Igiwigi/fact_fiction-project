it is rare to find tubules in which the lumen has been obliterated. The size decrease in
the hedgehog testis is correspondingly less.

In the ferret the degree of atrophy of the ancestrous testis is extreme, and it is known
that the anterior pituitary body is inactivated, or practically so, during this period
(Hitt and Parkes, 1983). As regards the hedgehog, it seems likely that the anterior
lobe is partially active throughout the winter. This difference is more remarkable
since the hedgehog becomes extremely torpid during winter even if true hibernation
does not occur, while the ferret shows no appreciable lethargy. A comparison of the
testis of the ancestrous and of the hypophysectomized hedgehog should throw light
on this point. It is possible, also, that the more active condition of the ancestrous
testis in the hedgehog is connected in some way with the fact that the testes are abdominal
throughout the cycle. The testes of the mole, however, which are almost abdominal,
are described by Courrmr (1926) and by TanpLer and Grosz (1911, 1912) as extremely
atrophic in winter.

(d) Effect of Captivity—A small number of animals were kept in captivity at room
temperature, and it is of interest to note that the normal rhythm had been disturbed
and that animals killed in January, February and March all possessed completely
active testes though the accessory organs did not differ materially from those of animals
in the field. This disturbance of the normal cycle is important from the point of view of
experimental work and will be dealt with later.

(e) Use of Accessory Organs.—In the fully active hedgehog, the reproductive organs
