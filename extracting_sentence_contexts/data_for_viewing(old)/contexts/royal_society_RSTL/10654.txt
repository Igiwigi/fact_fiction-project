ments of the head were seen, and also extension of the trunk. Tn this case also'in
addition to the frontal regions, portions of the head of the corpus striatum was remoyed:
on both sides, more on the left than right. þ

The facts of Experiment 23 show that extensive lesion of the prefrontal lobes, 8ubse-
quent to the time when all effects of destructive lesions at the base of the frontal
convolutions had disappeared, caused for a time disorders in the movements of the
head—shown in lateral oscillation of the head, and apparent inability to turn the
head and eyes.

There was also in this case a phenomenon not obseryed in any other cage, viz. —
ptosis of the right eyelid. There was no local injury perceptible to account for this,
but whether it was the direct result of the prefrontal lesions is a point that may be
questionable. The facts of this experiment taken with those of Experiments 19 and
20 render it probable that the prefrontal lobes have essentially the same physiological
relations as the electrically effective postfrontal centres. 1
