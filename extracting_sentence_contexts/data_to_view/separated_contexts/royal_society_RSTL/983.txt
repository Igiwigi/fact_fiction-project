Whether these cavities, which I have called preparatory
stomachs, are solely for purposes connected with digestion,
or are also in any way connected with the formation of secre-
tions peculiar to those animals, cannot be ascertained in the
present state of our knowledge of digestion. The oil of the physeter, which crystallizes into spermaceti,
shews some affinity in this respect to the secretion of fat,
that becomes suet, which is only met with in ruminating
animals: but on the other hand, the oil of the rest of the


of the Cavities which constitute the Stomach of the Whale. 101

whale tribe does not form this substance, more than the fat
of the horse produces tallow. These facts may be afterwards
explained by an examination of the digestive organs of the
physeter, when an anatomist shall have an opportunity of
examining them. These are enquiries which do not belong to the present
Paper, as it is only intended to add some facts to those already
laid before the Society, and in a future communication I hope
ﬆill further to increase their number.
