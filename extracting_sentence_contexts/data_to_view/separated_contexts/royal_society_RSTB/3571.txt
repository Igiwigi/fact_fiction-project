These “chorda cells” have, of course, no connection
whatever with the giant fibres (see RANDoLPH, 1892).

CUNNINGHAM (1885, p. 12) “got back... . to the old idea of the homology of
the notochord and the three giant fibres beneath} the nerve cord in the earthworm,”
and Perrter (1881, pp. 228, 229) remarked that the three longitudinal cords of
Pontodrilus recall, by their position, the chorda of Vertebrates. The connection of the giant fibres with undoubted nerve cells and the fact that
they contain typical neurofibrille are sufficient to dispose of the idea that these fibres

have any homology whatever with the notochord of Vertebrates,

V. Tue Grant FIBRES REGARDED AS SUPPORTING ORGANS, BUT NOT HOMOLOGOUS
with THE NorocHoRD oF VERTEBRATES. Vespovsky regarded the giant fibre in Rhynchelmis (1876, p. 340) as a hollow
central axis{ separating the two halves of the nerve cord, and that of Tomopteris
(1878, p. 88) as a medullary canal representing the remains of a groove of
invagination of the ectoderm, but in 1879 he pronounced the giant fibres of
Enchytraus to be tubes of a cartilaginous substance, but did not adduce any
histological evidence to support this statement. In his ‘System und Morphologie
der Oligochaeten’ (1884) he brought forward the view, to the support of which he
contributed further arguments subsequently, that the neurochord§ forms a peculiar
“ Accommodationsapparat ” which serves to support the ventral nerve cord during
the bending and contraction of the body, an interpretation which he regarded as
highly probable because the neurochord is best developed in those forms in which the
muscles of the body wall are weak (e.g., Lwmbriculus, Rhynchelmis), while it is
absent in Phreoryctes, which is remarkable for the strength of its body wall.
