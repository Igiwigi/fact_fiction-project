and elongation values in air. Similar evaluations have been made in the literature (e.g. [5]), but ae
the complete data should be considered before drawing conclusions. &

Similarly in the 1400 MPa strength class, the evaluation of the results can be skewed. The : S
dataset given in figure 5 shows an extremely low embrittlement factor for the TM1400 material. .
Tempered materials often exhibit a reduced sensitivity to HE (reinforced by the best elongation
and strength during charging; figure 3), but these results are also strongly influenced by the
material’s poor performance in the control test, where it showed the lowest strength and lowest
elongation of all materials (see ESM_1400class in the electronic supplementary material). The
embrittlement factor for elongation of QP1400 is in fact also penalized due to the material’s high
elongation in air, but both M1400 and QP1400 achieve the same elongation and strength in the
presence of hydrogen.

Whether the evaluation method of the test results is correct or skewed, the bigger question
is whether such tests are representative of the in-service conditions of high-strength steels and
which steels are best suited to the customer’s requirements. The SSRT has advantages in that it
is simple, reproducible and every sample is tested until a comparable (in stress or displacement)
point of failure. This avoids ambiguity of results from tests such as a constant load test, which
simply provides a pass or fail result, making a ranking among different materials difficult. The
test also has a major advantage in that even the longest tests took less than 10h. Compared with
other tests which can take up to 720h, the SSRT provides results much quicker.
