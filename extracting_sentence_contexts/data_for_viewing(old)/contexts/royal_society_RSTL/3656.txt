scribed, the germinal spot and vesicle are formed like other nuclei and cells.

191. I long found it impossible to understand in what way the membrane of the
ovisac, as I termed it, was formed around the mass of peculiar granules having the
germinal vesicle in its interior; and equally difficult to conceive the mode of origin
of the discus vitellinus, the true yelk, and the membrane of the yelk. It now appears
to me that all these (as well as the germinal vesicle and spot) originate in a corpuscle
having the same appearance as a corpuscle of the blood. That part of this corpuscle
which surrounds the germinal vesicle (see the figures), becomes the source of the pe-
culiar granules (as I formerly termed them) by which this vesicle is surrounded.
These peculiar granules—the objects snbsequently contained within the ovisac—are
not originally cells: so that the term granule proves to have been not inappropriate.
The fact is, they are discs, having the same form and general appearance as discs in
other situations (only being very red); and by a change the same as that we have 80
often seen elsewhere, assume a cell-like appearance, and are reproduced in the same
manner as other discs. Hence, in advanced states of the ovisac, the quantity of
these objects becomes very large: and, as we formerly had occasion to observe, they
arrange themselves into structures, some of which—the retinacula—enter into the
formation of the mechanism regulating the expulsion of the ovumZ.

192. But my purpose in referring to these discs s0 fully in this place, is to be en-
abled to make the following addition : namely, that they also give origin to the mem-
brane of the ovisac, the discus vitellinus as well as the true yelk, and the membrane
of the yelk. And as the discs in question are derived from a corpuscle having the
same appearance as a corpuscle of the blood, so therefore are all these objects.
