strongly than when simply mixed, it is fair to conclude, that
it is a real suboxide. Had not muriatic acid been used, the na-
tural conclusion would have been, that the ore was a mixture,
or at most a combination, of these two substances ; for, such
did it appear to be, by the testimony of the other acids. The
truth is, we are but little acquainted with the exact state in
which substances exist, in many natural combinations. How-
ever, in the mineral kingdom, such fallacious conclusions are
less frequently to be dreaded, than in the vegetable and animal
kingdoms. But, in every research, it is important to leave as
little room for them as possible ; and he who would indicate a
sure and constant method of ascertaining whether, in many
cases;‚Äù what we deem a component part is not in fact a product
of the operation, would render to science a service, the real
value of which is, perhaps, not now entirely foreseen.
