It is there that, during the period in which the stem is continuing t0
increase, we always find the most rudimentary segments ; and we may trace, as WE

descend the stem, a gradual passage from snch as consist of little else than the primor-
dial ring, to those which have attained their complete cylindrical form and their full
dimensions. Moreover it is obyiously there that the nutritive activity will be the
test; the sarcode-substance intervening between the base of the calyx and the suwm-
mit of the stem being in most direct relation with that of the interior of the calyx
(through the imperfect closure of its basal plates, < 61), and consequently with the
yisceral apparatus. And there is no other part of the stem in which there is the least
appearance of any multiplication of segments, either by the subdivision of those already
formed, or by the interpolation of new ones ;—the snggestion of Professxor ALLMAN, that
Wo transyerse ridges running round the centres of the segments may be the indication
=f such a diyision, being negatived by the facts already stated as to its real character. That this ridge, which is prominent in the segments of the upper and middle part of the
m, 80 far disappears in those of the lower as to be represented only by a single line,
due to the circumstance that the lower segments are those of which the skeleton is
Srat completed. —By the time that the opening-out of the Calyx commences in the man-
Her to be presently described, the number of segments in the stem has usually risen to
$5 or 16; those of the inferior third of the stem are pretty nearly solidified throughout,
Dnly a xmall pasage still existing through their interior; but those of the middle and
Spper thirds of the stem are still 80 far from having attained their completion, that
eir calcareous cylinders when broken across are found to be mere shells. The highest
Plate, on which the base of the calyx rests, is now distinguished from those below it by
b. somewhat larger diameter ; but it does not as yet present any approach to the pecu-
Dar shape which it afterwards comes to possess.—The entire stem remains clothed with
A thin layer of sarcodic substance; and its cavity is occupied by a cylinder of the same,
Skicl forms a continuous axis throughout its entire length, and passes up at its sxummit
Znto the calyx.
