with sufficient accuracy for practical purposes the next thing necessary was to settle the
best size and density of sample units or grids. In the jute survey the total expenditure which-
could be incurred was fixed by the amount of the grant sanctioned for this purpose. In this
situation the size and density of grids had to be determined in such a way that the margin
of error of the final estimate would be a minimum. (Alternatively, the permissible un-
certainty in the final estimate being assigned, it is possible to work out a solution for
doing the work at minimum cost.) Such solutions (which may be called optimum solu-

tions) are discussed in an abstract form in Part II, and numerical examples are given in
Part III.

34, As already indicated, the theoretical approach adopted in the present paper is based
on the joint use of the variance and the cost functions. This has been justified by the fact that
variances were found in practice to decrease more slowly than one would expect in the
normal case, and also by the possibility of determining the cost function with sufficient
accuracy for all practical purposes by empirical methods. The present approach has been
also fully justified on grounds of economy. The cost of a survey on the same scale as the jute
survey of 1941 could have been easily increased two or three times by a plausible but wrong
choice of the size of grids. For annual or periodic surveys (which give scope for what I have
called exploratory work) the present technique would thus appear to be the most suitable
one. On the other hand, for a survey which would be carried out only once or only at very
long intervals and where no previous information is available a simple random sampling
procedure would probably be found most convenient.

35. The human factor. So far attention has been confined to sampling fluctuations (which
