Did no
friction result from the pressure of the surfaces of bodies upon one another, their mu-
tual resistance would be exerted in the direction of the common normal to their point

of contact. We know, however, by daily experience, that the resistance of no two
surfaces is limited to this single direction. Friction presents itself wherever the re-
sistance of the surfaces of solid bodies is exerted, and is, in fact, but the resolved part
of that resistance in a tangent plane to the snrfaces at their point of contact. And
from the laws which have been proved by experiment to obtain approximately in
respect to it, it follows that within the surface of a certain cone, called the cone
of resistance, whose apex is at the point of contact of the surfaces, whose axis coin-
cides with the normal, and whose angle is twice that which has for its tangent the
coefficient of friction, every direction that can be taken is one in which the mutual
resistances of the surfaces of contact is exerted as perfectly as in the normal direction ;
in fact, that any pressure (less than that which produces abrasion) being applied to
the surface of an immoveable solid body by the intervention of another body move-
able upon it, is sustained by the resistance of the surfaces of contact, whatever be
its direction, provided only the angle which that direction makes with the perpen-
dicular to the surfaces of contact do not exceed a certain angle, called the limiting
angle of resistance of those surfaces. This is true, however great the pressure may
be, within the limits of abrasion.
