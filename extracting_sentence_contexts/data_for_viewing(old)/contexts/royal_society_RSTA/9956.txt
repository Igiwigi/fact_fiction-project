reaches a limiting value as the size of the drops increases (very nearly equal to ~
8 metres a second), above which it does not increase ; it even decreases a little as the
drops grow still greater.”

He then showed that this apparent anomaly is due to the drops becoming deformed,
so that instead of retaining the shape of spheres they become flattened out, thus
presenting an increased resistance to the air through which they fall. In consequence of
this deformation large drops rapidly break up in the air into smaller drops, and
Lenarp found that drops of 4 mm. diameter were stable under all conditions, but that
drops 5°5 mm, and above in diameter could not exist for more than a few seconds after
attaining their final velocity relative to the air.

This fact plays an important part when drops of water are falling through ascending
currents. According to the table given above, all drops of water of a smaller diameter
than 4°5 mm. will be carried upwards by a current of 8 metres a second, while
all drops of a larger diameter than this will be held in suspension, neither rising nor
falling. But the latter are unstable, and after floating for a few seconds in the
current break up inte small drops which are carried upwards. Thus no water could
possibly fall through an ascending current of air having a velocity of 8 metres a
second or more.

That thunderstorms are accompanied by strong ascending currents is admitted
by all meteorologists, but I know of no actual measurements of the ascending
currents within a thundercloud ; still the question can be discussed from indirect
evidence.
