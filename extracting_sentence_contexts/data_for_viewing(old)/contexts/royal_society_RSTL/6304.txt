282 MR. PRESTWICH ON FLINT-IMPLEMENTS,

unayoidably short notice, T had to start alone, although I was afterwards joined by my
friend Mr. Joux Evans, F.S.A.*

Thus the inquiry had not the adyantage of all the co-operation for which I had hoped ;
nor was I more fortunate in Paris, for my friends there, upon whom I called in the hope
that they might join me, were absent in the country. On my arrival at Abbeville,
M. Boucuen DE PERTHES at once accompanied me to the seyeral localities he had described,
opened his interesting collection for examination at my leisure, and placed me in full
possession of all the facts bearing upon his discoveries. To M. Marcorre, Curator of
the excellent local Museum of Abbeville, I am indebted for information on many points
respecting the organic remains and the recent fauna of the district. To some members
of the engineers © des Ponts et Chauss6es”” I have to express my obligations for the
various levels taken through the instrumentality of M. Bovenzr DE PERTHEs. At
Amiens I was most kindly assisted in the furtherance of this inyestigation by M. CxarLEs
P1x8ARD, a Member of the © Societ6 des Antiquaires de Picardie,” who liberally placed
at my disposal a small but special collection of teeth and bones he had found at
St. Acheul, and obligingly undertook the determination of seyeral levels which were not
given on the Ordnance Maps of that district. See Appendix (F).
