he regarded it as his liberal and Enlightenment duty to oppose the ‘new system of chemistry
to his dying day’, which occurred on 6 February 1804 in Northumberland, Pennsylvania [26,
pp. 262-401].


Contrary to the traditional view of Priestley’s role in the Chemical Revolution, his main focus
was on the critical evaluation of the oxygen theory rather than the speculative defence of the
phlogiston theory, though he did believe that, in the current state of chemistry, rejection of the
former entailed acceptance of the latter [28,32]. He showed that the phlogiston hypothesis, which
upheld the traditional view of elemental water, was not clearly evidentially inferior to Lavoisier’s
oxygen theory and its revolutionary view of the compound nature of water [33, pp. 1-70].
He also expressed a general, epistemological scepticism about Lavoisier’s results; he cited—as
confusing the phenomenological description of facts with a hypothetical interpretation of them—
the French chemist’s excessive use of sophisticated experimental procedures, elaborate and
expensive laboratory apparatus, and overly complex ‘computation’ and ‘allowance’ to generate
the idealized data necessary for the formulation of ‘true equations’ [31, p. 132]. Although Priestley
opted for the ‘phlogistic hypothesis’, he recognized that it was ‘not without its difficulties’, but he :
insisted that it shared these difficulties with Lavoisier’s theory. Whether in the form of phlogiston :=
or caloric, each theory violated a shared epistemic commitment to a chemistry of ponderable
substances, isolable in the laboratory [28, pp. 203-205]. Priestley valued both hypotheses as
heuristic devices for the generation of new facts in a patient, humble experimental approach to nee)
God's infinite creation.

Priestley and other phlogistic chemists faulted Lavoisier not for emphasizing the importance [4
of quantitative analysis, but for narrowing the domain of chemistry to the stoichiometric DNS
