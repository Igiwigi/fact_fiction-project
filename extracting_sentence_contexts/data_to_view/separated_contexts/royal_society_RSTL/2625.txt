We here perceive, in accordance with the preceding phenomena, that in column A,
where the intensities are not considerable, and the distances small, the force is as TD
or very nearly s0; whereas in column F, in which the intensities are considerable, and
the distances great, we have the force nearly as uy In the other columns, B, C, D, E,

the forces are nearly as 3:1 when the distances are as 2: 1, except in one case in


INQUIRIES DEPENDING ON REPULSION LIABLE TO FALLACY. 435

column B, where the force is again nearly as — in the case of the distances being

small, as at 9* and 45, We also perceive in one instance, that where the distances
are as 4: 1, the forces are as 6:1, as in the distances 18? and 4*5 of column B.

20. These facts are of great consequence to every species of electrical inquiry de-
pending on any instrument whose indications are derived from repulsion. CoULOMBE
found, for example, that the balls of his balance were repelled with only one half the
force at a given distance when the quantity of electricity in one of them was reduced

to one half, and further concludes that the whole repulsive force expressed by Þ

diminishes for the same distance, D, as the absolute quantity of electricity in each of
the repelling bodies considered as points. This principle he applied extensively, with
a view of detecting the ratios of the quantities of electricity accumulated in charged
bodies or in any given point of them.
