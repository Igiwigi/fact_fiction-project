Figure 1. Steady-state and transient oscillations in the MSC: (a) the scheme of the structure, (b) the dispersion curves, (c) the
standing wave of anti-phase oscillations and (d) the resonant pattern. (Online version in colour.)

There, an unexpected result was detected in the SCL: the action of the frequency of the point
harmonic force that is resonant for the MSL results in the development of growing oscillations
in certain selected directions, while the oscillations in other directions are practically locked into
the source vicinity. Despite the fact that an incorrect explanation was suggested for the obtained
results, the detected phenomenon attracted attention to the problem and strongly motivated its
further study.

In [21], a comprehensive investigation was performed of the out-of-plane dynamics of the SCL
and of the uniform triangular-cell lattice. The new line-localized primitive waveforms (LPWs)
were discovered. Their main features are listed below:

— LPWs are ‘self-equilibrated’ standing anti-phase oscillations, strictly localized on node
lines of certain orientations, while the nodes outside these lines remain at rest. Any
canonical sinusoidal wave consists of LPWs.

—A single LPW does not conduct energy, while a band consisting of two or more
