The time of first crack appearance ta decreased with increase in both frequency and applied
voltage, as is often seen in fatigue cracking under cyclic loading. The exponential nature of the
collapsed graph indicates that both amplitude and frequency of the applied AC field determine
the time of first appearance of the cracks. A possible explanation of the decrease in ta with increase in frequency incorporates the fact
that the number of electrical load cycles increases with frequency, for the same time interval. If
each AC loading cycle causes inhomogeneous strains between the particles that try to align along
the field direction, the material becomes more fatigued and easier to fracture. Sircar et al. [37] report that for the same applied voltage, the curvature of the cracks varies with
frequency.
