describes how the mathematical properties of connectivity patterns in complex

Author for correspondence: networks determine the dynamics of the systems exhibiting those patterns [1].

Daniel KostiÂ¢ A network is a collection of nodes and edges that are connected in certain

Topological properties are mathematical properties obtained by quantifying net-
works by using graph theory and similar approaches. Since many biological
systems can be modelled as networks, i.e. they have many interconnected
elements that can be considered as nodes and edges, this approach clearly has
enormous explanatory potential. This fact is even more significant given the
sheer microphysical diversity of biological systems, e.g. the same topological
explanatory pattern can be used to explain the robustness of the brain, a computer
network, an ecological community, a protein interaction network and so on.

One of the major demands on such a theory of topological explanations
is to account for what it is for a certain pattern to be explanatory as a matter of
a principle (why the explanation succeeds, or why it does not succeed), as
well as to account for explanatory asymmetries, i.e. in a good explanation, if A
explains B then B should not explain A; otherwise, the explanation is circular or
too permissive.

In this paper, I present a general theory of topological explanations and
