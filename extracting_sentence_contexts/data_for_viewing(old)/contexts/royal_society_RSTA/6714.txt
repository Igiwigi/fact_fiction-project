§ See, for example, Fricke (1928); on the conductor, ‘Grell (19274, 1927). A concise account of the
classical theory from a modern point of view is given by Krull (19394).

Schmeidler (1928) has generalized parts of the Dedekind-Weber theory of algebraic functions of one
variable to functions of m—1 variables yo, ..., Y, over a perfect (vollkommen) field P. He does not, how-
ever, work directly with yp, ...) Ym» but with new variables x, ..., ¥, obtained by a linear transformation with
indeterminate coefficients. Under these conditions, his paper includes (1.6), the expression (d(«))—'R[«]
for the module complementary to R[«], and the inequalities be =< S, DecS. .

that the discriminant of the polynomial (x—a)~-!f(x) belongs to S, we obtain the relation
