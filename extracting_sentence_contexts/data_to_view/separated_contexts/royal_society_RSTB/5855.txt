In the six experiments in which I,k did not extend above the wound (section 11), the
distances of its centre from the wound were usually rather less, though again much more
than could be expected on Scnouts’s theory. They ranged from 37° to 65°, the mean
being 48°, and in five of these six experiments I,k was imperfect, its stipule next to the
wound being abnormally small. But reasons were given for considering that these
imperfect I,k leaves resulted from operations made late in the plastochron, and this
fact helps to explain them. For when P, is split in a similar manner, then a very
imperfect leaf often develops from the larger part of that primordium as we have found,
with its stipule next to the wound very small or absent. Consequently it can be under-

‘stood that when I, is split late in the plastochron, at a time when it is probably already
partially determined, an imperfect I,k leaf arises.
