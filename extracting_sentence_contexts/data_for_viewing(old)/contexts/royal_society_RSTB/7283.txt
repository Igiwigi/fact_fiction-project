branches, one extending from the gonad to the seventh and the other to the ninth sternite.
These strands establish the linkage between the gonads and the ectodermal efferent ducts.
After junction of these two parts has been established an ectodermal encroachment takes
place from the proximal part of the hypodermal efferent ducts to invade and largely
replace the original tissue of the mesodermal ducts. This encroachment has been shown in
both sexes of the three species studied. The condition in the male Mycetophila, where the
mesodermal strands are very short or absent, is evidence that anterior extension from the
ectodermal ducts could reach the gonads even without the intervention of a mesodermal
tissue tract.

At the point where a mesodermal strand ends distally it is usually fixed to the hypoderm
through some myoblastic tissue, which is clearly distinct from that of the rest of the meso-
dermal strand. This fact has not been realized by many authors, who have described the
mesodermal strands as extending posteriorly further than they really do go. This has led
to the description of terminal ampullae, which are, in fact, hypodermal rudiments of the
secondary reproductive system. The myoblastic tissue does not merely run between the
distal ends of the mesodermal strands and the hypoderm, but it also covers the growing
rudiments of the ectodermal organs. It is transformed later into the muscular tissue of the
hypopygium.

(hk) The efferent system in the female

The efferent system, excluding the two mesodermal oviducts, and the accessory organs

originate in all the forms studied from hypodermal rudiments, one on the eighth and one on
