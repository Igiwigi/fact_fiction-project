The Trotter-Neveu-Kato Approximation Theorem S
states these semigroups converge to another semigroup, say {T(t),t > 0}, iff their resolvents 1S
converge to the resolvent of this semigroup. More precisely :<

lim T-(f)x=T(t)x, t>0, xeX, (2.2) a
rol :

iff :=
lim (A-A,) 1 x=(A-A) lx, A>, xEX; (2.3) :8
role :

where A, is the generator of {T;(t),t > 0} and A is the generator of {T(f),t > 0}. Recall that the D8

resolvent of the generator is the Laplace transform of the semigroup; because of (2.1) we have Dw

oo :
(A—A,) 1x =| e“T,(pxdt, A>a,xEX. [3

In particular, the implication (2.2) > (2.3) is immediate by the Lebesgue Dominated Convergence
Theorem and the real value of the approximation result lies in the fact that it allows deducing
convergence of semigroups from the convergence of their Laplace transforms. This is particularly
important because the operators forming the semigroups are rarely given in a manageable
form but in many cases something substantial can be said about the resolvents. (By contrast,
unless extra conditions are met, convergence of Laplace transforms of a sequence of vector-
valued functions does not imply point-wise convergence of these functions, see e.g. [2] p. 42,
[3] pp. 319-320, or [4] p. 13 and pp. 47-48.)

Three remarks are here in order. The first is that to prove (2.2) it suffices to show (2.3) for just
one 4 > w; this is handy, as we seem to remember curious situations where proving (2.3) for all
2. > w was next to impossible because one A > w was particularly uncooperative, despite the fact
that, as we already said, convergence of the resolvents for just one 4 > @ is known to imply this
convergence for all A > w.
