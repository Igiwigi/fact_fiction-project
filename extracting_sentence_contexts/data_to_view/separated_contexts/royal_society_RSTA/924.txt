We now use (3), which expresses the fact that the flow of current across a surface of
revolution bounded by the plane s = 0, and having its vertex at any point of the axis

We are led from the considerations of Section 4 to expeot that a solution of the above
equation can be found, In fact, it oan be shown as a particular ease of a general contour
integral that, for unrestricted values of y, positive or negative, (z > 0),
