of the crack is shown below each image.

segment the crack, it does improve the visibility of the crack. Compared with the resin-rich region,
the relatively poor detectability of cracks in the fibre-rich region is also worth noting. In fact,
crack A has cut through the entire transverse yarns (shown in the SEM observation in figure 6). However, none of the three scans has shown any evidence of it in the region of the transverse
fibres because of the more uneven background contrast against which to detect the crack. Strategy IV.
