As regards the positions of the carbon atoms in the unit cell, we can approximately
locate them with the help of the magnetic data. Let us assume that the benzene
ring in C,Cl, has the same structure as in C,H,, and that the chlorine atoms are
magnetically isotropic ; the anisotropy of the C,Cl, molecule will then be the same
as that of the C,H, molecule. This assumption may not be wholly justified,
especially in view of the fact that Mrs. Lonspate’s X-ray results for this crystal

* We should remark here that yin the magnetic case is the angle ¥ which the 7, axis makes with

the “c” axis.
