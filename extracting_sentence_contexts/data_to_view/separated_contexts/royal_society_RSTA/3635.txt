The consideration of sea level in these studies, however,
usually assumes that the present-day hypsometry also applies to the past. This assumption is
difficult to justify because the surface topography of the Earth has gradually been modified
by the thermal and chemical evolution of its interior. In fact, substantial water influx is possible
without causing any change in the sea level, as shown in the next section.

3. The secular evolution of water budget and the emergence of continents

(a) Eustasy and continental freeboard

After the rise of atmospheric oxygen at approximately 2.4 Ga, hydrogen escape into space became
trivial [41], and the amount of surface water has been subject to a dynamic balance between
volcanic degassing and subduction. There is no a priori need for the volume of water in the oceans
to stay constant, and the distribution of water among different reservoirs could also change.
