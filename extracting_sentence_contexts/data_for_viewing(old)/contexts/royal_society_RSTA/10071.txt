There will be mixed crystals containing every proportion of nickel from 2 or 3 per
cent. to about 6°5 per cent. (as well as the richer crystals of the second type formed
at the eutectic temperature), for the cooling will have proceeded so rapidly that the
continual redistribution of nickel necessary to produce uniformity in composition of
the mixed crystals (of the nickel-poor type) will not have had time to occur.

$15. On such a view of the process of crystallisation during cooling as is above
indicated, it will be seen that a structure identical in form with that observed in the
Widmanstiitten figures and similar in composition to that shown by the magnetic
properties is explicable. The fact that the breadth of the layers of kamacite some-
times varies from one part of a meteorite to another would be explained by difference
in the rate of cooling, or in the manner of deposition of nuclei in different parts of
the material. The fact that the average thickness of the kamacite bands decreases
as the total percentage of nickel in the material increases can be explained in the
same way. Thus, for example, in a meteorite containing a relatively high percentage
of nickel, e.g., 12 per cent., the whole material will exist “uncrystallised” until a
temperature in the neighbourhood of 300° C. is reached. When this temperature—
the temperature of lability of the metastable solid solution—is attained, crystallisa-
tion will begin; but the rate of growth round the original nuclei will be so slow (on
account of the lowness of temperature) that, unless the rate of cooling is excessively
slow, there will be a succession of returns to the state of lability during cooling. If
we assume that the successive growths of nuclei take place in parallel octahedral
layers, the final result, after the eutectic temperature is passed, will be comparatively
narrow bands of kamacite with intervening thin bands of taenite.
