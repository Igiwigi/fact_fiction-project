This, naturally, was only possible in young animals. The intact skull in
3 Puppies was compressed for this purpose in various directions, and the amount
2 measured by the diminution in diameter of the skull between the points compressed. A As a matter of fact the results thus obtained did not differ materially from those
S produced by the bag pressure, and consequently are not detailed further. ic The effects of intra-cranial hemorrhage were employed as a means of pressure when
5 the compression by the bag had injured some vessel, which bled when the pressure
2 was removed from the bag.
