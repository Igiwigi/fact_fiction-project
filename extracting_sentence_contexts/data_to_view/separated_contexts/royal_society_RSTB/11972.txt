However, analysis
of the strings Nim produced, as well as those of other sign-
trained chimpanzees, did not provide evidence for the use of
syntactic structures as adult humans do [39,40], suggesting
that they lack the cognitive ability to produce syntactic combi-
nations of words. Supporting this, an analysis of wild
chimpanzees revealed that call sequences partially represent
imperfect ordering rules, but most of them do not follow any
tule [41]. However, the fact that chimpanzees can produce
different signs or calls in sequences suggests that the ancestors
of humans and apes were capable of producing trivial combi-
nation, which provides the basis for compositional syntax [3]. The ability of receivers to extract a meaning from a
sequence may not necessarily depend on grammatical rules. For example, mothers can understand what their children
want them to do from trivial combinations of words, such
as ‘mom, milk’ or ‘milk, mom’.
