I also append tracings of another observation to render
the difference in the rate of the rhythm more apparent to the eye.t

* It is of importance to point ont the fact that some of my previously published experiments appear
conelusively to prove that the natural stimulation which is supplied by the marginal ganglia of the
Meduse resembles all the modes of artificial stimulation which are competent to produce artificial rhythm
in one important particular; the intensity of the stimulation which the marginal ganglia supply is 8ghown
by these experiments to be about the same as that which is required to produce artificial rhythm in the
cae of artificial stimulation. In proof of this point I may allude particularly to the observations which are
detailed in V., $ 1 (a), (b), and (c) of my sccond paper. f
