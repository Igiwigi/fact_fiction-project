Introductory. Iv has long been known* that the grains of the Darnel contain a poisonous body
(Lolium), which can be extracted by ether. This substance has marked toxic action
on rabbits and certain carnivorous animals, and is said to induce vomiting and other
unpleasant symptoms in man, but to affect pigs, cattle, and geese but little, or not
at all.f

In 1898} attention was drawn to the fact that a large percentage (80-100 per
cent.) of the grains of this grass contain a definite fungus-mycelium, always situated
in a definite layer of the seed, z.¢., in the remains of the nucellus, just outside the
aleurone-layer of the endosperm. Although certain details were made out regarding the nature and position of the
hyphe, their relations to the seed and seedling, and to the poisonous properties
referred to, almost nothing was discovered regarding the systematic position of the
fungus, the course of its life-history, or even how it obtains its entry into the Lolium. In the following account of an investigation pursued in the Cambridge Botanical
Laboratory during the past session, I have succeeded in carrying our knowledge of
this remarkable fungus considerably further, and especially in rendering clear the
principal points concerning its life in the plant, and the mode of infection of the
embryo.
