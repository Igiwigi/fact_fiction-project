to distinguish it from a “ dark line,” which breaks up into a series of ‘‘ dark points.”
Several authors have observed that the “ dark line ” in certain genera is so constituted,
but it was long looked upon as a fairly accepted fact that the median “dark line” in
other genera, e.g., Huphyllia, Flabellum, was a really continuous line representing a
special median lamina, Huinpz (Introd., p. 99), in examining Septastrea, a genus
structurally resembling Flabellwm, found, instead of a distinct lamina in the median

of a median “line

plane of the septum, a separable fenestrated tissue on the inner or median surfaces of
both halves of the septum.

Those are the already observed facts on which the theory rests of a ‘ primary
septum ” composed of “ primary spines.” No one has sought to explain the origin of
the said “spines,” or how it came about that they are so remarkably varied in size,
colour, composition, whereas the rest of the septum, throughout the whole group of
Madreporaria, has a perfectly definite fibrous calcareous structure.

Similar Dark Bands of the Growth-lamelle.

In studying the “dark line” of the median plane of the septum, an important
consideration appeared to me to be the exact similarity in appearance presented by the
dark bands at the inner surface of each of the growth-lamelle composing the fibrous
portions of the septum (cf. below, figs. 30a and B). It was not difficult to recognize
the cause of the latter appearance. For each calicoblast which I had observed at the
