Now there are a number of lines, which by
their position and absence of », separations to stronger lines have the appearance of
being D,, (1) lines. If they are, their mantissee must differ from multiples of A, (in
the present case 80A,) by multiples of the oun. The fact that they may do so does not
of course prove that they are D,, lines. If they do not do so it proves that they are
not. They may however in the latter case belong to a displaced series, satisfying the
multiple law when the proper displaced limit (yé,)S (0) is employed.
