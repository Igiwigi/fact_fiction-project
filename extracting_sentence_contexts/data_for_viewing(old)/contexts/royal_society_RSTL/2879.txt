In conclusion I may be permitted to observe, that in applying weak electric cur-
rents to the reduction of metallic oxides, it is absolutely necessary that a continuous
current be employed, and that its cessation even for an instant is often fatal to the $uc-
cess of the experiment on hand, which cessation or suspension, as far as my experi-
ments have gone, the modification I haye proposed of Professor DaxiguL's battery
appears to be capable of obviating.

* Some other curious circumstances connected with the decompoxing electro-chemical power of currents of
low tension have fallen under my observation, but have not yet been sufficiently examined to authorize their
publication as facts. Some of these I may perhaps at a future period, with the permission of the Society,
have the honour of submitting to its notice.
