screw stop for allowing a slow and definite escape of air. An opening at the bottom,
with a cock for drawing off water, was also provided. For forcing the air in, a syringe
for inflating bicycle tyres was used in the first instance and proved ample; in fact,
when once the pressure was raised, the small amount of air released from the water

was more than sufficient to maintain the pressure, so that it was continually allowed
to escape. The Stuffing-box and Cap to prevent Leakage.

24. The thing that was revealed by the experiments at high temperatures was that
the leakage of water at the coned bushes of the brake was so much increased by the
pressure within the brake that even when these bushes were adjusted to run, as close
as was practicable, on the cones of the shaft, this leakage was very considerable, so
that some other method of controlling this escape became necessary.
