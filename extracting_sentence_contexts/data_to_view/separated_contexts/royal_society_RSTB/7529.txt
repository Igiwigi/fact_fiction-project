Judging by the speed of wind
gusts which, suddenly meeting the locusts, carried them momentarily backwards, the
cruising air speeds of locusts flying against light winds varied between 2-5 and 4 m./sec. The impression that low fliers were regulating their ground speed by adjusting their air
speed according to the wind speed, was strengthened by a further impression: that higher
fliers were not so adjusting their air speed, so that their ground speed was more closely
dependent on the wind speed. The fact that higher fliers appeared to be more easily slowed
down and even carried backwards than low fliers in the same gust, might, of course, be
attributed merely to the fact that the wind is stronger away from the frictional drag of the
ground. But higher fliers appeared also to surge forward more freely when the wind dropped,
which could not be explained in the same way, and suggested that they were actually
