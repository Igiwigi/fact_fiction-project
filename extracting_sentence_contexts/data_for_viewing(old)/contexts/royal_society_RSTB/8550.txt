e-mail: pkappel@gwdg.de Animals must act to gain access to food and other vital resources; to find suit-

able habitats; to maintain homeostasis; to avoid becoming food for others; to
find and select mates; to rear their offspring successfully and to manage their
social relationships with conspecifics. Behaviour therefore represents a major
mechanism influencing an individual’s inclusive fitness, and thus ultimately
evolutionary change [1,2]. Adaptive behavioural solutions to recurrent, predict-
able environmental and social problems should therefore be favoured by
selection, resulting in robust, species-specific behaviour patterns [3]. Thus, opti-
mal behavioural rules can evolve [4], leading to an intraspecific reduction in
behavioural options. While there are several other main constraints on the evo-
lution of behaviour (see §4), this particular one is central to understanding
behavioural adaptations. Its importance derives from the fact that animals
typically first respond behaviourally to changes and challenges in their environ-
ment, whereas adaptations of their morphology, physiology and life history
take much longer [5]; indeed, tests of an influential concept in behavioural ecol-
ogy demonstrated that mobile animals respond quickly, often in an ideal-free
manner, to variation in resources, predators and competitors [6]. In fact, maxi-
mal behavioural flexibility might be generally advantageous in various natural
situations [7,8], including adaptations to climate change [9]. Thus, as has long
