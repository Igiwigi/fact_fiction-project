stems had been clothed, neither did any of them afford proof even that the plant
had been a jointed one. I then turned to the coal-seam from which the fossil strobilus
was obtained, and was at length rewarded by the discovery of a cluster of stems, each
one of which was clothed with its peculiar bark, having the enlarged lenticular nodes
