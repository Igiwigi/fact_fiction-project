holds in the sense of distributions. To obtain this we denote u! = u(x + 2) and u = u(x) and derive
a weak form of the ‘doubling variables’ identity

where we used the fact that u is distributionally divergence-free. This establishes that (3.3) holds
in the sense of distributions. Dotting the above equation with ¢, we find

(d + u- V)(Seu- L) = —L- Vydep — Set - Ve(Seut - L) + [Seul? + def. (3.4)

Integrating this balance over the torus, we have

[ |Seul? dx=-Ve - I deu(Seu - £) dx, (3.5)

where we used only periodicity of the solution fields. Averaging (in the separation vector ¢)
equation (3.5) over a ball of radius L centred at zero, we find
