It reveals a deep connection between the two-dimensional harmonic
oscillator and three-dimensional rotation, in particular accounting for the occurrence of the Pauli
spin matrices in (2.1), without directly invoking quantum mechanics, and anticipates many
properties of the two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator, such as the Schwinger oscillator
representation (as discussed below). A given state of elliptic polarization has specific values for each of L, M, M as well as H—being
1/2 times the four Stokes parameters, they satisfy L? + M? + M =H. In fact, any unit vector
u =(X,Y,Z) corresponds to a constant of the motion by the inner product C =u: (M, M,L). For
the polarization state whose Stokes vector s = u, C = H and antipodally, s = —u, C= —H; the basis
of L,M,M of the su(2) Poisson algebra is convenient, but no more unique than the choice of linear
and circular polarization states in defining the Stokes parameters. The Hamiltonian formulation gives an insight into polarization geometry in terms of abstract
phase space, which is four-dimensional with coordinates (Qy, Qy, Px, Py), and initial coordinates
(qx, 4y, Px, Py).
