When the several matrices are each of them equal to

we have of course q=g'=9q".., R=R'=R”.., and we find

or substituting for the right-hand side, the matrix represented by this notation, and
putting for greater simplicity

we find
(a,4 Y=(GWL(V/Reotng—(d—a)), Ls ) c,d | Le AL(/Reot ng+(d—a)) |

where it will be remembered that

The formula in fact extends to negative or fractional values of the index n, and when 1

is a fraction, we must, as usual, in order to exhibit the formula in its proper generality,
write q+2mz instead of 9. In the particular case n=, it would be easy to show the
identity of the value of the 8quare root of the matrix with that before obtained by a
different process. 46
