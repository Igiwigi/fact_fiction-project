I shall now proceed to select from the great mass of facts
that are exhibited on the face of Bengore promontory, and
occur in the contiguous basaltic country, such as seem appli-
cable to geological questions, and likely to throw: light on
such subjects.

Facts applicable to geological Questions.

1, Every stratum preserves accurately, or very nearly, the
same thickness through its whole extent, with very few ex-
ceptions.

2, The upper and lower surface of each stratum preserve
an exact parallelism, so long as they are covered by another
stratum ; but when any stratum becomes the superficial one,
its upper surface is scolloped, or sloped away irregularly,
while the plane forming its base continues steady, and recti-
lineal ; but the parallelism of its planes is resumed as 8001 as
another stratum is placed over it.
