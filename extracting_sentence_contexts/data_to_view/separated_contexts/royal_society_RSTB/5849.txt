HAMSHAW THOMAS ON SOME PTERIDOSPERMOUS PLANTS

allied to the Paleozoic pteridosperms existed in the Mesozoic period immediately prior
to the time when the Caytoniales first appear, and at a period when the earlier stages
in the evolution of the flowering plants must have been accomplished. In these groups
the seeds and pollen grains were borne on special branch systems or inflorescences,
some suggesting dichasial cymes, others apparently racemose in character. This
fact suggests a modification in our usual concepts of the characters of the Pterido-
sperme, and removes the difficulty which was felt in suggesting the derivation of the
flowering plants from forms in which the seeds were isolated on the margins of large
multipinnate fronds. Axilary branching is a characteristic of the flowering plants and was previously known
to occur in only one of the pteridosperms Lyginopteris oldhamia, where its presence had
been demonstrated by Brencutey (1913, p. 354). It is a constant feature in the
Corystospermacew, while the fertile branches of several species in this group
possessed bracteoles.
