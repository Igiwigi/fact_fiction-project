Whether this view be correct or not, it fits in well with the teachings of physiology
and pathology. For T1zzont has shown that the removal of the adrenals is followed
by pigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes, and in the majority of cases of
App180N's disease in which well-marked bronzing of the skin took place they have
been found diseased. The occurrence of ADpp1soNn's disease without apparent disease
of the adrenals can be easily explained on the hypothesis that they are supplementary
organs, as other organs may do duty for them, but it remains to be proved whether,
when they are apparently healthy in cases of bronzing of the skin, other conditions
may not be present which hinder the discharge of their functions, such as obliteration
of their arterial or nervous supply.

No sufficient explanation has yet been offered as to the cansation of ADppisoN's
disease, and if the facts described in this paper 8hould help to s0lve this problem it
may induce others to follow up these observations, which at first sight seemed to have
but the remotest bearing on human pathology. TI have tried to obtain pigments from
the adrenals by the use of various solvents, but as yet without result.

Are there any grounds for supposing that the product of their metabolic activity
may be derived from the histohzematins ? T believe this question may be answered
in the affirmative for this reason, that in the integument of Uraster rubens, as already
mentioned, hzmatoporphyrin occurs as $:ch, and here it is highly probable that it is a
