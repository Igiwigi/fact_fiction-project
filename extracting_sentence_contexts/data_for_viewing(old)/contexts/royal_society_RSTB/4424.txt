tubular, but in shape and size like the stone cells among which they lie, which may
be mucilaginous or resinous, but which are very different in appearance and distribu-
tion from the cells now considered (see below, pp. 400 and 405).

The general ground-tissue of the scales, low down, consists of generally uniform,
small rounded cells, averaging 10-20 in diameter. Their walls are somewhat
thickened, and are very definitely rounded off, so as to leave considerable inter-
cellular spaces (see text-fig. 3, g).

From still lower regions of the scale, approaching its level of attachment to the
peduncle, Licnizr describes a central, soft, parenchymatous ground-tissue for the
scales, coupled with a general increase of sclerification in an upward direction, The
fact that the lowest level reached by the scales in the fragment of the new species
is still considerably sclerised, and not yet provided with a parenchymatous centre,

lends its quota of support to the suggested magnitude of the cone, as given in
text-fig. 1. "

The stone cells, which invade and gradually replace the whole of the ground-tissue,
are very various in size, some of them being 90 and more in diameter, others only
