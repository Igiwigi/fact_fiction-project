was employed was fifteen pence a day, or £22 16s. 3d. a year. This is mentioned because it is not generally
known at how small an expense, services of this nature within the competency of the military force stationed
in the colonies, can be rendered, whilst the men who are 80 employed are ayailable for military duty at any
moment that may be required.


IN THE MEAN EFFECTS OF THE LARGER MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES. 125

influence its position, and taken on an average of a sufficient number of days to
make the figure a fair mean representation. This is the © diurnal variation,” as
shown by observation at different seasons and at different parts of the globe, which
it has been Mr. Farapar's object, in papers recently read before the Society, to ex-
plain physically. But the variation thus observed is in fact constituted by two vari-
ations superimposed upon each other, having different laws, and bearing different
proportions to each other in different parts of the globe. At tropical stations the
influence of what have been hitherto called the © irregular disturbances” is compara-
ratively feeble, and their periodical effects may be therefore less deserving of atten-
tion; but it is otherwise at stations situated as are Toronto and Hobarton, where
their influence is both really and proportionally greater, and already amounts to a
clearly recognizable part of the whole diurnal variation ; and it must be very far
otherwise at stations which still more nearly approach those localities on the globe,
where disturbances of this class become much greater than either at Hobarton or
Toronto. As these localities are approached, the mean diurnal variation must be
expected to partake more and more of the law by which the effects of those disturb-
ances are regulated ; and if that law be different, as it will be shown to be in the
