I have not ascertained expe-
rimentally on the Snake that the same muscles act when the animal inspires that
are shortened when we distend the lungs, but I have ascertained it in the Dog
and the Ass. I observed these animals breathe when the muscles were exposed,
noted the actions of the various muscles one by one, and after death inflated the
lungs; those muscles that acted during inspiration were invariably shortened when
the lung was distended, and those that were passive were lengthened ; on the other
hand, those muscles that were active during expiration, were shortened when the
lungs were flaccid. This fact rendered it unnecessary to find out by further vivisec-
tions the actions of the respiratory muscles, they could be ascertained leisurely on
the aead body and represented by accurate drawings; such drawings I have made
by aid of the tracing-frame recommended to me by Dr. HopexinÂ®*. 'These drawings
exhibit the changes effected in the form of the chest, the direction of the ribs, and
the length of the various respiratory muscles in inspiration and expiration. In the Snake all the ribs have similar motions and similar muscles by which the
motions are effected.
