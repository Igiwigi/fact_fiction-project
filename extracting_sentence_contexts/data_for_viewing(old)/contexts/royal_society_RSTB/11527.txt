step reaction, as was previously observed in the Type I
process in the presence of a-LA [41]. This fitting provided
ky = 1.64871, ky = 0.85871, kg =1.20s71 and ky=0.57871.

A The value of ky is close to that of k®*' (=1.21 s~1), while the
Ss value of ky is close to that of k™®! (=0.56 s~ '). Moreover, the
a sum of 1/k, and 1/k, (1.79) is identical to the lifetime of
2 | | Type I football (1/k'®'=1.79s). Therefore, we performed

the data fitting again under the restrictions of ks =k" and

ky = kB! which provided k, = 1.84 +0.21s~ 1 and k=
0.81 +0.06s~!. The fact that 1/k; + 1/ky + 1/k*®" holds,

s rather than 1/k, + 1/ky + 1/k®*"!, indicates that an additional,

Next, we analysed the residence time distribution of bound

ses in the presence of DM-MBP (figure 3k). It was well fitted
sce to a sequential four-step reaction with rate constants of
