+0°5 c.c. N/10 NaOH must be extraordinarily minute. Now, as HENDERSON (18)
has shown, protoplasm is admirably adapted to maintaining a constant hydroxyl ion
concentration, as it must contain carbonate and phosphate radicles, so that any small
amount of alkali entering the egg fails to change the hydroxy] ion concentration of
the cell contents.

The observations of Hanvny (17) upon the effect of N/250 NH,OH and
N/250 NaOH upon the museular and nervous mechanisms of Oassiopea afford
striking evidence to show that weak and strong bases differ in their action on the
cell. When the ectodermal granules of the Meduse are stained with neutral red,
and the animals are placed in the above solutions, muscular and neural responses
continue after sufficient NH,OH has entered to affect the colour of the granules, but
they cease in N/250 NaOH before the granules are affected. This fact points very

* Also an extremely minute trace of atmmonia should have the same effect as a solution of 50 c.c.
van't Hoff’s solution +0°5 c.e. NaOH, which is not the vase.

+ The pigment of Avbacia eggs ix certainly not in solution, as when the eggs are treated with ammonia
the pigment becomes purple, which is the colour characteristic of this pigment when precipitated in the
presence of alkali, and not the brownish-red colour of the pigment in alkaline solution.
