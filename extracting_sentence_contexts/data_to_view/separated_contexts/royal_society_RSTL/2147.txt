And it certainly
has the merit of simplicity and satisfactory explanation of
the phenomena. But it is an opinion which has not received
direct proof; and it is also obvious, that the phenomena may

be explained without it ; for we may just as well account for
the facts, by supposing two distinct heating influences, one
associated' in some very close way with the rays of light,
carried as it were by them through a glass screen without
heating it; the other being merely simple radiant heat,
affected by the screen exactly as the radiant heat from a non-
luminous body. (5.) In order to ascertain which of these suppositions is
true, it will not be sufficient to observe the effects produced
by the intervention of a screen alone.
