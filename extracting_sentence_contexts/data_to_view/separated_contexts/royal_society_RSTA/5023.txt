With some effort, introducing one hole to the d shell of Ag :
may be realized; yet the resulting highly electron-deficient Ag(II) cation claims its electron back :3
both in the gas phase [8] and when present in chemical compounds [9,10]. In other words, all :3
species containing Ag(II) are very strong oxidizers. This feature is seen in the second ionization :
potential of silver being the largest of the three congeners (21.45 Ag > 20.52 Au > 20.29 eV Cu); in
fact, it is larger even than those of non-metallic P, Se or Xe, and very close to that of bromine
(21.80 eV), a halogen! Concomitantly, Ag(II) is found mostly in fluoride ligand environments
[11], and only in a handful of known compounds does its first coordination sphere contain O,
N, C or S (see [12] and references therein). Ag(II) is incompatible with many common inorganic
and organic anionic ligands such as iodides, bromides, chlorides, sulfides, cyanides, carbonates,
amides, imides, phosphates, carboxylates, alcoholates, etc., and also with many neutral ones.
