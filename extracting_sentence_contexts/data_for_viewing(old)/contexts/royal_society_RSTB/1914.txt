ordinary reticulum ; the threads of the spindle can be distinctly traced into the
threads of the reticulum. Fig. 29 shows a little later stage in this process of
extinction of the spindle; the spindle in fact hardly exists as such, but is only to be
distinguished as a reticulum with small meshes ; this reticulum passes over directly
into the wider meshed general reticulum.

3 These observations agree completely with those of WrLson (21) on the cytoplasm
S in the egg of the Sea Urchin. Farmer and WILLIAMs (20) made similar observations
in the oogonia and oosphere of Fucus.

Such observations as these militate strongly against the view of a special spindle
forming substance, either archoplasmic or kinoplasmic (cf. SrRAsBURGER (12)). They
point to the fact that the spindle forming or kinoplasmic fibres result from a
rearrangement of the ordinary cytoplasmic reticulum.

That the spindle fibres stain more deeply with gentian violet, &c., than the other

* It is this substance which makes it so difficult to render visible the reticular structure of the cyto-
plasm. If the washing out with orange G. is insufficient, the substance in the meshes remains blue,
and obscures the reticulum; if the washing is carried too far, the blue of the reticulum becomes lost.
When the differentiation is at its best the amorphous substance appears as transparent yellow masses,
lying in the meshes of a blue reticulum,
