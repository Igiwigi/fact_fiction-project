and form peculiarly rich plexuses in the walls and trabeculz of many of the lymph sinuses.
I have not, however, been able to detect any communication between the larger com-
ponents of these plexuses and the cavity of the sinus, although such evidence as I have
is sufficient to show that the “ fine ” vessels do form a connection with the lymphatic
system,

Repeated injections have produced somewhat contradictory results. Injection
thrown into the “ fine” vessels has sometimes, though not always, made its way to
some extent into the lymphatics, appearing most often in those situated in front of the
clavicular symphysis upon the intermandibular floor or in those distributed over the
branchiostegal membrane and partially filling several of the large sinuses. The fact that
injection passes only with difficulty and sometimes not at all from the system of “ fine”
vessels to the lymphatics, added to the fact that no connection could be traced by
dissection between the two systems, suggests that the connection between the two
cannot be of an open nature, but that it takes place probably through the capillary ends
of the two systems, or at least between their finer constituents.

When dealing with such delicate structures as the lymphatics of Lophius, there was
always the danger that constituents of the “ fine ” vessel system, when injected, might
rupture into one of the fasciculated lymph channels or sinuses with which they are often
in such close contact ; and the capriciousness with which injection found its way into
the lymphatics made me for a long time hesitate to assume that there was, in fact,
a natural connection between the two systems. As the result of a recent and more perfect
injection (cold gelatine and prussian blue) I am, however, certain that there is a con-
nection, and that it takes place, at any rate in part, in the mucous membrane of the
