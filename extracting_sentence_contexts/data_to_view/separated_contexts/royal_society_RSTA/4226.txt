Given the ERIS (Q, €;, Dx) for k € Noo :=
NU {oo}, a sequence (ti, qi)ken With t, > t, and qi, — qx in Q, and q € Q, a sequence (9x)xen is called
an MRS if 4, ~ g and

lim sup (Ex (ter Fk) + Dic(qes Ike) — Ex the Mk) S E volts, 4) + Doo (Gur 9) — Eooltes qx)-

The importance here is that we have to recover mutual information on the energy increment
E cot, G) — Eoo(te, qu) and the dissipation D.o(q,.,q) with the help of one sequence (4x)x. This is
clearly distinct from separate relaxation, where there is no interaction between the two quantities. In particular, this relates to the obvious fact that, for an evolutionary theory, we need a recovery
condition that couples properties of the energy storage and the dissipation. Another instance
of an explicit coupling occurs in EDP-convergence (EDP =energy-dissipation principle) for
generalized gradient systems (Q,€,,R,) defined in [18]. To highlight the major advantages of MRS, it is sufficient to look at the case €, = € and Dy = D
for k € Noo, since, even for showing the existence of energetic solutions for one ERIS, the concept
of MRS is relevant and non-trivial.
