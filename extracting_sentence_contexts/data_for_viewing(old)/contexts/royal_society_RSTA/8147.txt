wards it will be necessary to pick out from the regions satisfying this condition that one
which reduces to a minimum the chance of accepting H’, when a simple alternative
hypothesis H, is true. If this region is the same for all the alternatives H, of the
set Q, then we shall have a common best critical region for H’y with regard to the
whole set of alternatives. The fundamental position from which we start should be
noted at this point. It is assumed that the only possible critical regions that can be
used are similar regions; that is to say regions such that P (w) =< for every simple
hypothesis of the sub-set . It is clear that were it possible to assign differing measures
of a priori probability to these simple hypotheses, a principle might be laid down for
determining critical regions, w, for which P (w) would vary from one simple hypothesis
to another. But it would seem hardly possible to put such a test into working form.

We have, in fact, no hesitation in preferring to retain the simple conception of control
of the first source of error (rejection of H’, when it is true) by the choice of ¢, which
follows from the use of similar regions. This course seems necessary as a matter of
practical policy, apart from any theoretical objections to the introduction of measures
of a priori probability.

(b) Similar Regions for Case in which H', has One Degree of Freedom.

We shall commence with this simple case for which the series (68) becomes
