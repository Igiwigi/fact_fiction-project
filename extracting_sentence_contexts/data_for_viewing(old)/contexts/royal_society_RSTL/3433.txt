the focus, the phenomenon may be ascertained to extend as munch in depth as in
breadth, so that the contracted portion may be compared to a solid ball, lying in the
midst of uncontracted and flaccid parts. If this ball be at the sarface, the almost in-
variable concomitant is a collection of expressed water in bullze between the sarco-
lemma and fibrillae. The contractile force seems to be exerted solely in the direction
of the length of the fibrillze, for in this direction only are the strizz beyond the spot
distorted. The distortion consists of an extreme stretching and widening of them
and their interspaces, which is greatest close to the ball, and gradually ceases at a
distance of thirty, forty, or more strize : thus the fibrillee not implicated in the con-
tracted ball are undisturbed, while those s0 implicated have their segments drawn

* Owing to the polygonal, and sometimes flattened form of the fasciculi, they may present, if twisted, an
appearance of unequal thickness at different points of their length, without there being, in fact, any contrac-
tion, or approximation of the transverse striz.

closely together in the one part, and stretched to a corresponding degree immediately
beyond. This first stage is represented in fig. 89.

The nucleus of contraction slowly extends itself, by involving a greater length and
a greater number of fibrillz, and while doing 80, has generally an oscillation along
