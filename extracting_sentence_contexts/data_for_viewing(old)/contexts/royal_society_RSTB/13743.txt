(c) Communication systematic combinatorial structure is at least plausible.

The model of communication we use is inspired by To model the village sign language setting, with vertical
the Rational Speech Act framework [60], albeit simplified rather than horizontal transmission, the simulation then iter-
for our purposes. Consider the case where an agent has to ates over the following steps:

all the languages, weighted by their posterior probability. 20 times:

However, this does not take into account the fact that a
receiver of a signal does not know what the meaning is,
so even if the correct meaning is associated with that
signal in a particular language, if there are other meanings in
that language with which that signal is also associated, then
there is the possibility of a failure of communication. To

(a) A meaning is chosen at random.

(b) The oldest agent produces a signal for that meaning.
