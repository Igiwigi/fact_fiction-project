charges from these amorphous regions. In the case of the P3HT with a MW of 77kDa, these
ordered phases are unlikely to be as present as in the 124 kDa P3HT sample, which leads to faster
carrier recombination kinetics of the carriers trapped in the amorphous regions of the polymer.
By contrast, for the low MW sample (44 kDa), the number of rich ordered phases within the film
would be larger but the degree of energetic disorder seems to be greater or at least there are less
favourable domains for intermolecular carrier transport that influences both the photocurrent and
the FF of the solar cells.

3. Conclusion

We have analysed a series of PSCs using different MWs of semiconductor polymer P3HT used as
hole selective contact. We have focused on the differences observed in the overall efficiency of the
solar cells under standard conditions and the fact that the PSHT polymer with higher MW leads to
the highest efficiency despite the fact that the use of high MW implies the presence of less ordered
polymeric domains and less crystallinity. An analysis in depth of the solar cell charge under
different light biases and the interfacial carrier recombination kinetics shows that the efficiency
of the solar cells with the 124kDa P3HT polymer is due to slower carrier recombination when
compared with the other two lower MWs of P3HT polymer. In good agreement with previous
experimental work, we have observed that the crystallinity of the polymer is not as essential as
had been previously considered, but that the balance between the interconnections of crystalline
domains and amorphous polymer phases results are key for the creation of percolation ways for
efficient carrier extraction.
