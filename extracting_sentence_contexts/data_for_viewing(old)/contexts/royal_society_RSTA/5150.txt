where p is air density, A is the rotor disc area and the thrust load Fy depends both on wind
speed U and the state of the rotor, conveniently represented by a thrust coefficient Ct. The latter
is primarily a function of the tip speed ratio A =wR/U and the blade pitch angle 6. The wind
velocity in equation (2.1) can be taken to be the relative velocity U,,| = U â€” x, thereby explicitly
including the effect of aerodynamic damping through the tower top velocity <(f). This model is
extensively used for control system studies (e.g. [4]).

The coefficients C,(A, @) to be used with equation (2.1) are here derived in three different ways.
The standard way is to use values obtained from steady-state rotor simulations under constant
wind. It is not straightforward to estimate (in fact, model) these coefficients accurately for many
different values of blade pitch and tip speed ratio, which also includes cases in significant stall
where the turbine slows down over a relatively long period of time to reach steady state. Typically,
the wind speed fluctuations move the turbine out of this regime long before the steady-state
behaviour is reached, and it is questionable how realistic the use of steady-state coefficients would
be in these cases. Therefore, the quasi-static model is only evaluated for the low wind speed of
6ms-! (case FcCtSteady). It is also common to approximate the Cp curve of a wind turbine by
a parametric function, e.g. using an exponential approximation [22]. From this, a formula for the
C, curve can be derived, but this approach is subject to the same limitation of modelling only the
steady-state behaviour.

In order to improve upon this, we have used a linear statistical model that assumes
the following relationship to regress the values of C; on values of the covariates A, 6 and
