Towards this aim, the complex
explanation is that other voltage-gated Ca** channels in the impedance is measured by imposing a small sinusoidal vol-
presynaptic terminal, particularly those directly involved in tage to the cell while measuring the elicited current. Using
presynaptic Ca‚Äù* entry (P/Q, N or R type), are affected differ- a lock-in amplifier, very small changes in phase and ampli-
ently. In fact, the opposite behaviour with pressure observed in tude between the voltage excitation and the current
Cay1.2 and Cay3.2 indicate that different calcium channel response can be detected at low noise levels [11]. Changes
types react very differently to pressure. Therefore, the release in the real part of the impedance correspond to changes in
processes of extra-somatic and somatic vesicle fusion are differ- the equivalent resistance and shifts in phase correspond to
ent in terms of activation volumes.
