The greater theoretical flow is readily explained by the fact that the vessels are
irregularly thickened internally, which has the effect of decreasing the effective
radius. Furthermore, transverse partitions occur at long intervals, and slight
constrictions at much shorter ones, and these will also retard the flow. The presence of imbibed water in the walls of the wood vessels is a factor worthy
of consideration, When saturated, the lignified walls contain about 50 per cent, of
