The greatest value of the numerator is 2 when 0 is a right angle, and the least
value of the denominator is 2\/pK, when the two terms are equal to each other and
to vg kK.

The maximum value of v therefore is Jar and occurs when 0=7 and KG?=pH

The preceding examples will suffice to show that it is easy to arrange some of the
known experimental facts in accordance with the general law of the flow of energy. I
am not sure that there has hitherto been any distinct theory of the way in which the
energy developed in various parts of the circuit has found its way thither, but there
is, I believe, a prevailing and somewhat vague opinion that in some way ib has been
carried along the conductor by the current. Probably Maxwerrs use of the term
* displacement” to describe one of the factors of the electric energy of the medium has
tended to support this notion. Tt is very difficult to keep clearly in mind that this
* displacement” is, as far as we are yet warranted in describing it, merely a something
with direction which has some of the properties of an actual displacement in incom-
pressible fluids or solids. When we learn that the © displacement” in a conduetor
having a current in it increases continually with the time, it is almost impossible to
avoid picturing something moving along the conductor, and it then seems only natural
to endow this gomething with energy-carrying power. Of eourse it may turn out that
