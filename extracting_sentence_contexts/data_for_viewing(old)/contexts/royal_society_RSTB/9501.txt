There simply is no evidence in the record to support
such a conclusion. To the contrary, the National Research
Council, the FBI, and SWGFAST have all recognized
the lack of scientific basis for such testimony and have
advised against permitting examiners to express opinions
to this level of certainty. Such a conclusion lacks a reliable
scientific basis.’

These cases attest to the increasing tendency among courts to
refrain from accepting fingerprint evidence as facts that can
be expressed with 100% certainty or suggesting that the evi-
dence alone is enabling the exclusion of all others in the
world except the concerned individual. Legal scholars
echoed that call for more humble conclusions [10,11,13].

‘SWGFAST recognizes that individualization has been used
within the latent print community to mean ‘to the exclusion
of all others’. The ability of a latent print examiner to indivi-
dualize a single latent impression, with the implication that
they have definitively excluded all other humans in the
world, is not supported by research and was removed from
