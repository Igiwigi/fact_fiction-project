Additional produced fluid processing is needed as ASP flooding results in the
production of emulsions with droplets as small as 10,1m in diameter. Finally produced fluids
(containing the ASP chemicals) need to be disposed of without impacting the environment. Technical difficulties include the fact that the chemical mix needs to be carefully designed for
the fluids to be encountered in the field. ASP flooding works best with relatively low-salinity
water (often optimal performance is achieved by the use of a salinity gradient during injection of
the different stages), but, offshore, seawater is the only source of injection water so desalination
or alternative chemicals may be required. Despite these difficulties, ASP flooding was applied onshore in the early 1980s when the oil
price was high.
