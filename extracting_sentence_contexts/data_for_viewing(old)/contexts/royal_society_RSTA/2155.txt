reduces latency on software functions triggering the DMA, and improves performance without 8 |
compromising functionality. Several additional optimizations have been made to the framework

for software routing: the process whereby a packet key is converted into the target synaptic 3
row address in SDRAM. As discussed previously, the updated packet key structure of figure 4, :
enables significant reductions in size of the master population table, greatly reducing average binary
search times. However, through recognition of the cortical microcircuit structure and topology,
it is possible to further optimize performance. For example, while the sPyNNaker software
package can handle a generic SNN model with multiple projections between populations, the
cortical microcircuit model has only a single receiving projection between each population. This
information is used to simplify code handling address look-up, acknowledging the fact that :8
only a single address will be returned, and removing multiple loops and conditional statements [S
accordingly. Overall these updates enable a single spike targeting a single neuron to be processed :3
in 3.55 1s, a 31% reduction relative to previously published results [12]. It is useful to contrast =
this number with the spike processing window, which effectively begins when neurons start : ‚Äù
sending spike packets, and ends when the second timer event is triggered, giving it range: : =

SpiNNaker machines comprise multiple 48-chip SpiNNaker boards, with board-to-board : ws
communication via data packets. All cores on the same board share a common crystal governing 1
clock speed, and therefore have aligned timers. However, crystal manufacturing variability leads 1
