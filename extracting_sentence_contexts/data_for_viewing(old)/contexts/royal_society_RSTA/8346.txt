the quartic ruled surface which is the intersection of two quadrics which touch each
other at every point of a line /. This is not a possible ®-surface ; for a general quadric
touching the first two at every point of | meets the surface in | counted four times and
in four of its generators ; and such a composite residual curve cannot be a -curve.
The other kind is not ruled, and it is the intersection of two quadric cones which touch a
given prime Il along a given line | of the prime.

4.4. The Surface 1;.—The surface just defined we shall call I;. Any prime through
| meets the quadric cones in quadric conical surfaces, and these, having the same tangent
plane along /, meet further in a conic which must lie on I;. Thus I; contains »?
conics lying in primes through |, and it is therefore a projected Veronese surface and
representable on a plane o by conics. There will be «4 of these conics ; so that they
will satisfy one linear relation ; and in fact it is known that they have a fixed self con-
jugate point pair XY, and that any two points which separate XY harmonically corre-
spond to the same point of the double line 1. Any line of w meets the line XY and
corresponds to a conic of I, touching II at some point of /. Any quadric cone which

touches II along ! will meet such a conic in just two free points, and the curve in which it
meets I, will therefore be represented on o by a conic. Now there are »7 such quadric
cones, »® of them having a given point of | for vertex ; and they meet I, in «5 curves
to which must correspond the 2 conics of a. In the present case however A consists
of sections of I, by just such quadrics touching II along 1; and A’ therefore consists of
all the conics of the plane w ; and any H-net of these gives rise to an H-system of quadric
cones in which the general ©-surface is a projected Veronese surface with a fixed double
line. It is easy to see that the curves of A are all rational normal quartic curves.
