The chills at 675° and 600°, together with the chill of Sn 15 at 600°, determine a
point on the 7C’ line with considerable accuracy, for this line separates the region in
which the 8 is free from @ from that containing the new « which has erystallised out
of the solid B.

Here we have, as might have been expected, a much more abundant and large «
crystallisation. Moreover, the 8, except in one spot far removed from «, has not
broken up into the striation. This phenomenon, seen also in the preceding chill, is
one reason, perhaps the most conclusive, for the truth of our view that the striation
did not exist in the 8 at temperatures above 500°, but is a change produced during
and sometimes after the chill, and due to the fact that the B of Sn 14 is so rich in
copper that at low temperatures it is in a very unstable state and readily breaks up
into a copper-rich and a tin-rich phase, thereby producing the striation. It is clear
that 8 slowly cooled below the JC’ line, out of which « has already crystallised, will
be less supersaturated and therefore more likely to bear a low temperature unchanged
than the B chilled above the JC’ line. For the same reason Sn 9 chilled at 546°
contains a mother-substance of 8 unstriated. We shall see that the 8 of Sn 16 and
17, necessarily poorer in copper, is much more stable and rarely striates. We are not
disposed to think that the two phases forming the striated B are identical with the «
and 6 of an unchilled alloy.
