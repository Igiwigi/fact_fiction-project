follicles filled with large fatty particles, differing most widely from the true sperm-cells.
The office of this median glandular mass is undoubtedly to supply the Cn. and
cementing fluid by which the animal forms and moulds its tube.

The testes in the male Terebella are the lateral pouches or true segmental organs, as
in the female they are ovaria. In this genus, as in. Arenicola, the generative products
in both sexes are early introduced into the general cavity, in the fluid of which they
rapidly become deyeloped.

In concluding his remarks upon the Terebellide, the author is anxious to recapitulate
one or two points. That the lateral pouches are the real reproductive organs is certain

from these facts :—
S At a particular season they are crowded with ova (in the female) and sperm-cells (in
he male). These products respectively are less developed than those contained in the
neral cavity; but as to their being one and the same bodies in the two places, there is
EM doubt. Next, there is the negative evidence of the absence of any other organ in
Jhe body entitled to be called a genital apparatus. And thirdly, there is the incontro-
&ertible proof, derived from the structure and segmental position of the organ, that it is
'Zhe homologue of that part in the Hirudinei in which the ova are formed and afterwards
Aodged throughout the entire period of their intra-maternal life. The segmental organ
"Df the Terebellidze, as will be afterwards proved, bears a most intimate analogy to that
2f the Sipunculide amongst the Echinoderms.
E Sabellide and Serpulide —The system of the segmental organs in these families pre-
RFents several peculiarities. In the true 'Terebellidzee these organs were found to be
