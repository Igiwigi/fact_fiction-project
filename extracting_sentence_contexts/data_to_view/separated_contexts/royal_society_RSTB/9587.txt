CsrA also controls motility, with CsrA upregulating the
expression of flagella by stabilizing the transcript of the flagel-
lar master operon flhDC [87,88]. Interestingly, CsrA not only
regulates motility in this post-transcriptional manner, but is
also directly involved in flagellum biosynthesis by suppressing
flagellin biosynthesis prior to completion of the flagellar T3SS
[89]. Based on the fact that the CsrA gene is mainly present in
genomes that encode flagellin, this has been postulated to be
the primordial function of the Csr system [89]. In addition,
CsrA directly regulates the expression of several main regula-
tors of c-di-GMP levels, connecting the two main pathways
influencing flagellar biosynthesis [90,91]. Both T3SS also can sense and react to the proximity of host
cells or other surfaces.
