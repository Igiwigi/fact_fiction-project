A particle in such a potential will, to the leading order in ¢, undergo drift with speed

independent of the drag coefficient c, provided c > 0 — indeed, when matching the drag c@ to the
forcing ecm A” the drag coefficient cancels out. Interestingly, although the drag is responsible for
the presence of drift, the speed of the drift is independent of the drag coefficient. The explanation
of this seeming discontinuity lies in the fact that as c— 0, the time it takes to approach vgrift
approaches infinity.

(ii) A bead ona rigid hoop

As another application of theorem 4.2 we consider a point mass constrained to a rigid hoop in R?. The particle is subject to drag proportional to the speed of sliding along the hoop. No additional
forces, apart from the constraint and the drag, act on the bead.
