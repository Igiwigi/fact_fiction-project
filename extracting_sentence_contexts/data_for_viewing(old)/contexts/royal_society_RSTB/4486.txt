which precedes rupture in tension than in compression in all the woods studied, and
in the different inclinations of the planes of slipping in some of the woods, can be
correlated with the differences in the numerical values, obtained for the strength
under these stresses. It is pointed out that this mechanical anisotropy of the cell-
walls is not wholly inconsistent with the micellar hypothesis of NAcent, which was
framed to explain the anisotropy in other properties of cell-walls. Since, however,
fundamental portions of NAGrxi’s hypothesis, such as the postulating of crystalline
ultimate particles, are not necessary to explain the facts, an alternative hypothesis of
cell-wall structure is proposed.

8. In the hypothesis, it is suggested that the mechanical anisotropy, as well as the
double refraction and visible structure of cell-walls, may be explained as a result of
mechanical causes operating on the substance of the cell-wall in the course of its
development from a highly viscous fluid to a more rigid condition.
