Our next goal is to consider the effects
of more global copying operations.


4. Knowing of the record but not the outcome

Immediately above, in equations (3.18)-(3.20), we have insisted that the orthogonality condition,
Tr pea ps A — 0, should be satisfied ‘in the apparatus’, that is, that the apparatus eigenspaces that
correspond to the records should be orthogonal. This insistence stemmed from the fact that the
copying evolution 4p coupled only to A. However, one can imagine a situation where S(s_4)p
couples D to a global observable of SA. In that case, one might be able to find out that A ‘knows’
the outcome—the state of S—without actually finding out the outcome.
