S There is evidence here of a slight temporary increase of excitability after benza-
nine, though this is soon lost sight of, and the reaction thereafter is practically
parallel with that of the protected nerve.
& In cases of still deeper poisoning, especially when the heart showed unusual
Resistance, stimulation of the poisoned nerve caused contraction in three experiments,
&t 9°5 centims., 6 centims., and 5 centims. respectively, whilst the companion pro-
cted limbs responded at 15, 19°5, and 16 centims,
& Excitability of motor nerves is entirely suspended by doses of benzaconine just
insufficient to arrest a vigorous heart. Though all these facts may be demonstrated
with the aid of single induction shocks, similar phenomena follow stimulation by
faradisation, the muscle yielding a good preliminary contraction, which shows a
tendency to break down if stimulation is extended to 2 or 3 seconds. ‘Ihe
subsequent failure of response on repeated stimulation and recovery after a rest
pause are both witnessed.
