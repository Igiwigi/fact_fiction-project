porphyrin nucleus, central to the structure of chlorophyll, that paved the way
for using chemical fossils as biomarkers ((38]; cf. [17]), even before the age of
photosynthesis life may have been living on energy sources bound within rocks,
such as iron. Rather than just the presence of water or energy, it is the kinetics
of water flows that constitute the crucial criterion for such processes to succeed
(cf. [39]).

Not only has Earth initially provided an environment for life to develop,
but also the resulting living organisms have subsequently shaped the planet.
In particular, the large abundance of oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere is the
result of biogenic photosynthesis. Such feedback mechanisms gave rise to the idea
of describing the Earth’s biosphere, atmosphere, oceans and soil as a complex
entity in what is referred to as the ‘Gaia theory’ [40,41]. In fact, it emerged from
thoughts about simple signatures of life on another planet [42], and given that
planets outside the Solar System cannot be explored by spacecraft, measurements
of the abundance of molecules in the planetary atmosphere from related spectral
features in order to construct a biosignature are the very limited ‘bits and pieces’
of information upon which we can draw conclusions about life. Such efforts
mark one of the greatest challenges ever undertaken in observational astronomy
