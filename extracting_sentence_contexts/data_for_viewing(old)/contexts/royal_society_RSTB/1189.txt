methods of experiment in each case, it will be better to arrange the facts as follows :—
(1.) Excitation experiments on the cortex.
(2.) Excitation experiments combined with division of commissures, ‘.¢., corpus
callosum, &c.
(3.) Excitation experiments combined with the excision of the opposite “motor ”
area.
at(4. ) Excitation experiments combined with hemisection of the spinal cord or bulb.
a5. ) Ablation of one hemisphere.
B(6.) Ablation of the “motor” area of one hemisphere followed by ablation of that
E the opposite side.
a7.) Excitation of the corpus callosum.
(8) Degeneration of fibres after excision of portions of the cortex cerebri.
gWe will now briefly state the more important facts determined by the above
iathods of experiment, postponing for the present any criticism.

2 1. Excitation Experiments on the Cortex.
Ey was first observed by Hirzie,* later by Ferrier,t ALBertoni,{ and Munk,§ and
equently by Franck and Prrres,|| that powerful excitation of one hemisphere in
ip Carnivora produced movement not only of the corresponding or opposite side of
Te body, but also of the same side as that stimulated.
Franck and Pirres|| showed further that when the muscles of the same side were
ilown into action they contracted ‘01 second later than those of the opposite side, a
mdst important observation.
UBNOFF and HempENHAIN,1 CARVILLE and Duret,1 confirmed these facts.
J Antoxe** observed that while in dogs bilateral representation of the facial muscles
