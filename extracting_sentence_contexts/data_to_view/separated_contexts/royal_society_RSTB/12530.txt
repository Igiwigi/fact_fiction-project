It has been
suggested that TRPA1 menthol sensitivity is linked to specific
serine and threonine residues found in transmembrane seg-
ment 5, and that several nearby residues are responsible for
species-specific TRPA1-menthol interactions [31]. Insects lack a true TRPM8 orthologue. In fact, the Drosophila
genome contains only a single TRPM family gene, Trpm
(figure 1, top) [32]. While separated by several gene duplication
events and more than 550 million years of evolution, Drosophila
Trpm and its chordate counterpart, TRPM8, are both involved
in cold sensing [33]. With respect to TRPAs, the Drosophila
genome encodes four TRPA family genes (figure 1, bottom):
TrpA1 (the homologue to chordate TRPA1), painless (pain),
water witch (wtrw), and pyrexia (pyx).
