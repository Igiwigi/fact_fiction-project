two other species of Echinus which are common at Plymouth, viz., #. miliaris and
E. acutus. In the case of EZ. miliaris a fairly complete series of stages were obtained
which were used to confirm the observations made on Â£. esculentus, and to bridge over
one or two gaps which through insufficient material were found in the series of stages
of E. esculentus in my collection of the larvee. In a previous paper (16) T have
described the main peculiarities of the echinopluteus of E. miliaris, which differs
markedly from that of E. esculentus. I may here remind the reader that it is a
smaller larva, and of a more flattened shape in an antero-posterior direction than the
larva of Hchinus esculentus ; that it only develops one series of ciliated epaulettes,
and that the characteristic green pigment of the adult first makes its appearance at
the base of each of these epaulettes (compare figs. 7 and 9, Plate 8), The just meta-
morphosed Echinus miliaris is also distinguishable from that of H. esculentus by the
fact that in the former case there is a pair of fully developed tube feet in each radius
in addition to the unpaired one, whereas in the latter case this is not so (compare
figs. 8 and 10, Plate 8). In the case of Echinus acutus I was not successful in
rearing the larvee for more than 10 days.

A comparison of the early stages of development of these three species shows that
from the start they are distinguishable from one another, although the larvae of
E. esculentus and FE, acutus very closely resemble one another, differing principally in
size, whereas that of /. miliaris is markedly different from them both (compare
figs. 12 and 13, Plate 7). The blastula stage in the last named is more elongated
and thinner walled, and this elongation is shown by the succeeding gastrula and
echinopluteus stages to be due to an increase in size of the forehead or preoral
portion of the larva. This enlarged forehead, which is evidently a reminiscence of
