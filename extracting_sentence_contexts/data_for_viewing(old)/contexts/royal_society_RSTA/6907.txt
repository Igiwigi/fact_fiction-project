19. At first sight it would seem that this method of total reflexion super
earlier method in giving all information about the exponents e, more readily even in
the non-singular case: but this is not so. The nest (C,) terminates with a space C, which
includes those parts of D given by the ¥ and 0, excepting those 0 which belong to C.
Similarly for any stratum S$. Hence the process does not in general locate precisely the
meeting of D and § already denoted by §,,. Both methods of reflexion are in fact required
to complete the geometrical theory.

For example, let D PR ee ae 3d b, |; with «+ 7 columns in all, where

D,, denotes « columns referring to neither ®, A nor C. Here m,— 2, my — 1, e, = 2,

C, = Cyg567,5 to use an obvious notation, the last suflix ~ denoting a set of 4 single
suflixes. We should then have a nest
