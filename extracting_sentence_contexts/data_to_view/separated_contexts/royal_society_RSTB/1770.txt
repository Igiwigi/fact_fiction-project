The isogens have been constructed by me on the following method :—
If the probability for the single age combinations of the parents could all be expressed in whole
= numbers, we should have nothing more to do than to connect all the squares marked by identical figures. If further, we had to do exclusively with vertical or exclusively with horizontal curves, we should need
simply to draw connected lines from the centre of one square to the centre of the other square showing
the same probability. But, as both suppositions are not satisfied by the facts, we have to use inter-
polations. Regarding the first cireumstance, that the centre of a square is occupied, not by the whole degree, but
| by a mixed fraction, it follows that the point of the full degree must be looked for on another point of
the axis of the square. Thus, for instance, the isogen of 37 per cent. must have its starting point
| between the ages of
24-23* = 37°5 per cent.
and difference 2°2 per cent,
24-24 = 35:3 ”
To fix the place of this point, I divided the space between the centres of these two squares into 20
t equal parts of 1 millim. each; the whole distance of the two squares being 2'2 per cent., each of the
20 millims. represents 1°1 percent.
