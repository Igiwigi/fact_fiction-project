E.M.F. between carbon, platinum, and other metals, b for carbon should be 5:2 x 104,
since its value for platinum is 4°93 x 10“ The difference between this and the above
numbers does not appear to be very great, but the effect of a small error in b is
enormous when we come to calculate from it the value of , the number of corpuscles
in a cub, centim. of carbon.

If we take 7°8 X 10 as the best value of b, and C = 2180 at 1515° absolute as
being the mean of the two series of temperature measurements, we find A is of the
order 10** and n is of the order 10”. Now, Mr. Parrerson* finds that at ordinary
temperatures n= 10". The effect of temperature on the resistance of carbon
indicates that the concentration of the corpuscles would be at least ten times as
great at 1000° as at 0° C., so that we should expect to find n of the order 10”. As
a matter of fact, if we take ) = 5°2 x 10* instead of 7°8 x 10%, we find n = 5 x 10?!
instead of 10*%.

Reasons which might make this method of determining » give values which are too
large, will be considered at some length after the experiments on sodium have been
described.

IIL. Experiments with Sodiwn.

$1. Nature of Problem.

Sodium was selected as the next metal to be investigated on account of its strong
electropositive character. Since this implies a great attraction for positive electricity,
