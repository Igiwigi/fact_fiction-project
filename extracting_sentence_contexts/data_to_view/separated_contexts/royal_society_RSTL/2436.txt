F.R.S. Received May 21,â€”Read June 4, 1835. IN the Memoir published in my Zoological Researches, p. 1, with its sequel, p. 63,
having first made known the fact of the Brachyura of the Decapoda (Crabs) passing
through the intermediate form of Zoea; I have now to announce that they undergo
another metamorphose, no less singular and unlooked for, in which they assume the
form of the genus designated by the name of Megalopa by Dr. Leacn, from the dis-
proportionate size of the eyes. This second stage we may therefore consider analo-
gous to that of pupa in the class Insecta.
