(electronic supplementary material, table S2), this formula yielded
a value between 0 and 1 for every interaction.

Variability was calculated using two components. First, unpre-
dictable variability was calculated as the number of changes in AU
combination, plus the number of changes in intensity of AU10,
AU12, AU26 and EAU3, divided by the length of the video in
seconds. Second, predictable variability was the number of frames
for which a repetitive dynamic action descriptor (RDAD)—
AD181 (lipsmack), AD182 (teeth chatter), AD183 (tongue chatter),
AD184 (jaw wobble)—was active, divided by the overall duration
of the facial movements in frames, and multiplied by 2 to account
for the fact that these movements occur at approximately 2 Hz.
Overall variability was the sum of these two components. The com-
ponents are weakly negatively correlated, indicating that both need
to be taken into account in order to gain an overall picture of the rate
of change of the face.

(e) Measuring social relationships

We used available data on social interactions between April 2018
and April 2019—from eight months before video collection
started until the end of video clip collection—to construct a dom-
inance hierarchy for both groups. The types of interaction used
were displacement, unidirectional aggression, and submission.
