the Cause of coloured concentric Rings. 281

The same experiment may be repeated with the red bow ;
but as here the first surface is essential to the formation of the
bow, the plain side of the convex lens or concave glass, when
placed against the prism, as before, will produce streaks ;
neither the bow, nor its streaks however will be in: the least
affected by the convexity or concavity of the outward surface

D of the glass applied, through which the light is admitted. A
a scattering glass will have no effect to disturb the bow or its
Â£ streaks, and when this glass is emeried on both sides, we have
= again the bow complete, but without streaks ; and by this fact
5 it is proved, that unless a polished plain reflecting surface is
5 applied to the prism, streaks cannot be formed.

S The most favourable way of observing the eolours of the
E blue bow streaks that are formed when a plain glass is laid
Z under the base of a right angled prism, is to place a screen of
