Muscle Curve.—The contraction curves of frogs’ gastrocnemii are greatly altered by
aldehyde. There is seen a much nearer approach to the veratrine curve than was
geen in the case of aldoxime. In fact, in the prolonged descent and alteration, or
Sven obliteration of the secondary curves, the action closely resembles that of
‘veratrine. In the ascent and height of the curve the likeness to veratrine is not
found. On the contrary, the height in solutions of medium strength may be increased,
fand the ascent is always at first rendered more abrupt.
