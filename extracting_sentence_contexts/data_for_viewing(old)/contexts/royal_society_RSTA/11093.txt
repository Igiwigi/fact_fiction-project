And they are all members of the same chemical family and of zero valency. In all,
too, the molecule is monatomic, so that whatever complication may be caused by the
expenditure of radiant energy on internal work in the molecule may be presumed to
be absent. Any relation, therefore, which exists between the refractivities of the
elements may be expected to show itself more clearly in this chemical group than in
any other.

The refractive indices of all five gases have been measured by Sir WitiiAM
Ramsay and Dr. Travers, and are given in their paper published in the ‘ Philosophical
Transactions.’*

In a letter, published in ‘ Nature’ of October 16th, 1902, I drew attention to the
fact that these figures bear to each other a curiously simple relation. Within narrow
limits of divergence, easily accounted for by the difficulty experienced in purifying
the gases, and the smallness of the quantities with which the experiments were
made, the refractivities are in the proportion of 1, 2, 8, 12, and 20; or, more simply,
of }, 4, 2, 3, and 5, as shown in the following table :
