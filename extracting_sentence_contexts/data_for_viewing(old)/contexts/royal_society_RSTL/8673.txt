478 DR. D. FERRIER ON THE BRAIN OF MONKEYS.

the cerebellar surface beneath was yellowish in colour, but not softened, No other
lesion existed in the brain.

This experiment was unsuccessful in 80 far as the object of localizing the lesion in the
occipital lobes was concerned, but is a valuable confirmation of the results obtained by
former experiments on the angular gyri. In this experiment, besides the complete
removal of the left occipital lobe and extensive injury to the right, the angular gyrus
was deeply involved on both sides, not throughout, however, The lesion was, however,
extensive enough to produce total blindness; and it further illustrates the fact that when
the angular gyrus is destroyed on both sides no compensation of visual perception
occurs.

Beyond the fact of loss of sight, which is to be attributed to the lesion of the angular
gyri, the lesions of the occipital lobes were in a great measure negative, the animal
retaining its muscular powers, and apparently other senses, and till exhibiting, though
to a less extent than before, its desire for food.

Experiment XXII.

January 22nd, 1875.â€”The occipital lobes were exposed on both sides in a monkey,
and the surface exposed destroyed by the cautery, which was also passed deeply into
