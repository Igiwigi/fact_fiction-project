If it be held for some time in the flame, it will be gradually
diminished, by evaporation ; but there is much reason to think,


and the Mode of its Communication, 155

that the heat which it acquires is not communicated to it by the
flame, but by the wood to which it adheres, which is s00n heated
by the flame, and even set on fire. I cannot refrain from just observing, that it appears to me to
be extremely difficult to reconcile the results of any of the fore-
going experiments, with the hypothesis of modern chemists re-
specting the matertality of beat. Deeply sensible of the insufficiency of the powers of the
human mind, to unfold the mysteries of nature, and discover
the agents she employs, and their mode of action, in her secret
and invisible operations; and being moreover fully aware of the
danger of forming an attachment to a false theory, and of the
folly of wasting time in idle speculations; I have ever, in my phi-
losophical researches, been much more anxious to discover new
facts, and to show how the discoveries of others may be made
useful to mankind, than to invent plausible theories; which much
oftener tend to misguide, than to lead us in the path of truth
and science. There are however situations, in which an experimental en-
quirer sometimes finds himself, where it is almost impossible for
him to abstain from forming, or adopting, some general theory,
for the purpose of explaining the phenomena which fall under
his observation, and directing him in his future researches. Finding myself in that situation at this time, I beg the atten-
tion, and above all the indulgence, of the Society, while I en-
deavour to explain the conjectures I have formed, respecting
the nature of heat, and the mode of its communication.
