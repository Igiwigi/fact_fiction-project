Its
nearest analogue in the ring theory is a Fourier component. The essential property ofa
spherical harmonic of degree n is that when the operator V? is applied to it the effect is the
same as multiplication by —n(n-+1)/p?. In view of this fact it is evident that a solution of
(12+1) is

X=hA+ s s (Am elant +. Bm eignt) Pm(cos 0) eimt,

n=O0m=—n

waa (12-2)
Y=k+ 2, PAC eign! + Dm eign!) Pm(cos 0) eiF,
where q, and qj, are the two roots of
(9-4 S n(n 1) (7-4 Salut 1)) SUE (12-3)
and : Ap(q,—a Bama 1)) Gr
Baqi —a iHam(nt 1)) =0D™, (124)

This is the most general solution, since the coefficients A”, and B” can be chosen to give any
required values of X, Y when ¢ = 0, except when (12-3) has two equal roots, in which case
a treatment is required which is similar to that applied in similar circumstances in §7. The
analogy with §7 throughout will indeed be obvious, though the summation with respect
to m does not appear there.
