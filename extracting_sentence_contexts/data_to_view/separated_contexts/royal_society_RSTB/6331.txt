(Pp. 142-143.) If successive cross-sections of a feather are taken from tip to base, it will be seen that
the two most apical barbs fuse to form the rhachis before cornification commences,
and since the feather is growing only at the base, this fusion is really a combination
of their growing basal regions. In fact, the process of cornification does not usually
begin until several barbs have thus fused. When sections are taken through older
feathers in which cornification has proceeded almost to the base, there might appear
superficial grounds for such a statement. Actually, the tips of the barbs are keratinized
before the bases, but it must be remembered that growth takes place in the reverse
direction (7.e., base to tip) and fusion of barbs occurs before cornification has begun.
