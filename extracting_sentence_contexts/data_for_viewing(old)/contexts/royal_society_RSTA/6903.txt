Hence

Tueorem 9. Jf, and only if, D meets each stratum of &, then the matrix pencil possesses a
singularity N of column dependence. D will then meet each stratum in a [v—1] with the possible
exception of h separate strata, each of which D will meet in an [¢+-v —1], where ¢ is the number of
elementary divisors associated with the particular stratum. And if these meeting spaces of D and B
do not completely define D, then D must also contain a singularity M of row dependence.

MINIMAL INDICES OF COLUMN DEPENDENCE

17. The method of reflexion can now be applied to any stratum S, and it will give
all information about the singular form N as well as the original form L. In fact let D
meet S in the space §,,, an [e+v—1], and therefore admit a certain nest of spaces
(S,,) through successive reflexions

Assume one or more ¥/, to occur, else no new feature arises. Since D will now meet each
stratum, we can take S$ to be the stratum C (x — 0) without loss of generality. The total
