Sbundle.t Hence we regard these gaps as corresponding to the typical canals
Fdinary stem, in so far as they mark the position of the disorganized proto-
=n ps. As to the lax tissue which usually fills these spaces, two views are
| It may have been primary, consisting of parenchymatous cells which were
among the primitive trachese from their first origin ; or it may have been a
nation, analogous to a thylosis, such as has been observed in the carinal canals
setum.{ We regard the latter view as the more probable. All our specimens
branching are comparatively advanced stems, with a considerable thickness
dary wood. Hence it is almost certain that the primary tissue at the base of
hh would have already become functionless, especially since many of these
were evidently abortive, as will be shown below. The formation of thyloses
ich conditions is quite probable. We are the more inclined to this hypothesis
s fact that the tissue filling the gaps is conspicuously different from the sur-

© point is shown in a similar section of another specimen, C.N. 132*. In one of the

kindly lent to us by Count Sorms-Lavpacn, this structure is, if possible, even more
preserved than in the section figured, é
O.N. 20n, and 1554.
