The theoretical value of the reciprocal compressibility (2-40 10! dynes/cm.’)
satisfies, of course, exactly the relation rat +-2c¢,) with the theoretical values of ¢,,

and ¢,, and coincides with the experimental value since this value has been used for
the determination of the constant A. But it differs from the experimental elasticity
constants. This is an incongruity not of the theory, but of the experimental results. In
fact, the measurements of ¢c,, are rather inaccurate (it has been measured only within
10% error). Therefore the experimental values agree with the theoretical values within
the limits of error.

The perfect agreement of the experimental and theoretical values of ¢,, are a strong
confirmation of the theory; for, the theoretical value of c,, does not depend on A (ork),
but only on the lattice constant.

8. NUMERICAL RESULTS FOR THE COUPLING COEFFICIENTS

For the purpose of numerical calculation of the coupling coefficients the adjustable
parameter ¢ in equation (5-10) has been chosen equal to 1. All terms smaller than 1 %
of the largest term in each series were neglected. Since the series in question converge
