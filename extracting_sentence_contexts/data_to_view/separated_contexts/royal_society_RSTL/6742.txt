If we look at the above » Table, the ll important fact will be obvious, namely,
the higher the conducting-power the higher the percentage decrement in the conducting-
power between 0® and 100*; in fact we have always found this to be the case; and from
experiments made with about 100 alloys in this direction we haye not found a single
case where the percentage decrement in the conducting-power between 0* and 100? is
greater than that of the pure metals; further, we haye found that we may deduce the
conducting-power of the pure metal from that of the impure one when the impurity in it
does not reduce it more than, say, 10 to 20 per cent. ; for we have proved experimentally
that within those limits the percentage decrement between 0? and 100” in the conducting-
power of an impure metal varies in the same ratio as the conducting-power of the
impure metal at 100”, compared with that of the pure metal at 100%. Thus the per-
centage decrement in the conducting-power of pure iron between.
