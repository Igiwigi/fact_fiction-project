et al. (1987), Young (1997) and de Dominicis & Giardina (2006). It is, however,
appropriate to mention that they have involved the introduction of unusual (and,
at least initially, non-rigorous) mathematics and ansitze, often guided by physical
insight as well as driven pragmatically by a lack of alternatives to progress at
the time. These irregular procedures led to predictions that regularly turned
out to be confirmed in computer simulations of the models, as well as similar

5More precisely, the Dean’s problem corresponds to the SK spin glass where the sum in
equation (2.1) is over all (ij) and each Jjj(=Jji) is drawn independently from the same distribution.
To model a short-range spin glass, the {i,j} are chosen as neighbours on a lattice of appropriate
dimensionality; three for normal experience.

6M fact, introduction of an analogue of temperature has proven to be a very valuable tool in
optimization, using the so-called ‘simulated annealing’ (Kirkpatrick et al. 1983), in which stochastic
imprecision is deliberately introduced into a computer updating algorithm in order to stochastically
overcome barriers in a simple energy/cost description, and is then gradually reduced.

with new types of probes. For the infinite-range Sherrington—Kirkpatrick (SK)
spin glass,’ most of these results have recently been proven with rigorous
