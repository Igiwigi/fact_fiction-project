I have now finished this endeavour to exhibit the more recent
historical facts connected with muscular motion.

It will be obvious to every one, that much remains to be done,
before any adequate theory can be proposed. 1 have borrowed
from the labours of others, without acknowledgement, because
it would be tedious to trace every fact, and every opinion to its

myself, and I have adduced many general assumptions and
