Here, regardless any €y)x improvement due to A, the measure ||L2(jx)||
remains controlled by &,, «€7. The same happens with the BB rule, but in a rather more punitive
way as &, «€. This error degrades the overall simulation accuracy to first order.

7The structure of these errors in the duct flow modelling results from the fact that in bulk the third-order derivatives vanish
on the account of a FxCqy Dy lx =O, Dog Cox ayCge Ayyeix = 0, etc. because the implicated odd-order velocity moments amount to
zero. However, this form of truncation error does not apply to boundary rules, which implies that third-order derivatives are
typically non-zero. This constrains the boundary error of parabolic schemes to third order.
