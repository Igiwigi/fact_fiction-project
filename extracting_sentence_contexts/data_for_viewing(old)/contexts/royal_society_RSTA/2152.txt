Here, Q is the maximum value of the period to be represented. The following properties of Sq are
proved in [12].

(i) Any non-zero signal in S, has period exactly q (i.e. it cannot be a proper divisor of q).
(ii) The spaces Sj, and Sj, are orthogonal for q;#4qj, over any interval that is a common
multiple of qj and qj.

So (3.6) is a decomposition of x(n) in terms of an orthogonal set of signals where the component xq(n)
has period q and belongs to the $(q)-dimensional Ramanujan subspace Sj. But since Sq only has
dimension ¢(q), it does not include all period-q signals. In fact, an arbitrary period-q signal can be
decomposed into a sum of components in S, where q; are divisors of q [13].? The beauty of the
decomposition (3.6) is the so-called lcm property [13]. Namely, once we have obtained a unique
decomposition (3.6), suppose the non-zero terms are

Xqu (11), Xqo (M),- -«/ Xqx (1). (3.7)
Then the period P of x(n) is given precisely by
P=Ilcem(q1,92,---,4K): (3.8)

It cannot be smaller, that is it cannot be a proper divisor of this lem, as proved in [13].
Note that the set of rational numbers k/q in the frequencies 27k/q represented in (3.4) includes
all rationals of the form
