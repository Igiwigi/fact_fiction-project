The chloride effect has more recently been used as evidence that
an anti-diuresis produced by some experimental procedure has occurred through the
mediation of the animal’s own pituitary. Thus, Pickford (1939) showed that administration
of acetylcholine inhibited a water diuresis in dogs and at the same time increased the
concentration of urinary chloride, results which were shown to be dependent upon the
integrity of the posterior lobe. These and other facts were produced as evidence that acetyl-
choline probably acted on some part of the nervous system stimulating the secretion of the
hypophysis. Van Dyke (1936) stated in his monograph (p. 326) that the ‘chloride-con-
centrating’ effect of an extract may be studied to show its similarity or otherwise to the
action of the vasopressor hormone. ACTIONS OF THE NEUROHYPOPHYSIS 405

It was thought that investigation of the effect of stimulation of the neurohypophysis on
the concentration of urinary chloride might give additional evidence as to the site of action
of the stimulus.
