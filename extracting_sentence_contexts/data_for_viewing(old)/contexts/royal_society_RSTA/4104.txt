structures to manipulate water. By studying these examples, it is hoped that new solutions can be
developed to help in water collection, water purification and separation of water from oil.

2. Collecting water

Air is a potential source for water. Fog is a mass of micrometre-sized water droplets that form

when air becomes saturated with water vapour. The size of the droplets means they float in the Dos
air and deposit onto a surface as a result of either settling or interception. Fog can be a vital source : =
of water, particularly in arid areas that receive little rainfall. : S

It would be beneficial for populations in these arid regions to develop a means to harvest fog 73
directly from the air. Such ideas are by no means new. In fact, there is evidence that suggests aed
hunter-gatherer groups were able to populate arid areas along the southern coast of Peru by 22
using fresh water from fog over 5000 years ago, though the collection method is unknown [14]. : Sg
Today, a common method for fog interception and harvesting uses nets which are able to provide : S
a supplemental source of water in arid regions across the globe (figure 4). Charities such as : Ss
FogQuest have installed polymer nets in Central and South America, Africa and South Asia. In : a

addition, to overcome the limitations of a two-dimensional net, new designs are being developed,
such as a tower by the charity Warka Water. However, the nets in these devices are typically made
of material that has not been optimized for water collection.

Several animal and plant species have evolved surface structures and chemistries that enable
them to collect water from fog (figure 5). These include Namib Desert beetles, several lizard
