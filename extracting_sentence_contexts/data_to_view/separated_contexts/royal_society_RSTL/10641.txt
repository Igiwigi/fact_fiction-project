= From a consideration of these tables there can be no doubt of the general fact that

a diminution of pulse-rate, brought about by lowering the temperature of the blood

flowing into the heart, causes an merease in the quantity of blood thrown out from the

gventricle at each 8ystole, and consequently an increase in the work done at each, systole ;

Sond vice versd.

> The changes in the outflow from the ventricle at each systole are not, however,

Zinversely proportional to the changes in the pulse-rate, 80 that the total outflow,

Zand, therefore, the total work during any given period of time, decreases with a

Sdiminiched pulse-rate, and increases with an increased pulse-rate.

& Whether any definite relation, beyond the general one given above, can be

Destablished between the pulse-rate and the outflow at each systole, we are not as yet

Sprepared to say ; a consideration of this and of some other interesting points which

= 8uggest themselves in this connexion must be left for a future paper. AQ In conclusion, we desire to express our most earnesb thanks to Professor MARTIN
for the aid and encouragement which he has given us during the progress of this
work. We are indebted to him not only for many valuable suggestions in the earlier
part of the investigation, when snccess seemed doubtful, but also for personal
as8istance which he has sometimes kindly given.
