THE EVEN-FACED POLYHEDRA bq7| AND p q,|

Generalizing figure 5, we see that the in-centres of a network of Schwarz triangles

(f 77) are the vertices of parl,

which is a single polyhedron whenever f, q, r are either integers or fractions whose denomin-
ators are odd, the faces at a vertex being

In particular, 234|, 235|, 234|, 233], 225]

are the truncated cuboctahedron and its analogues:

as we remarked in § 5. In two cases, 23 4 and 23

5|, the densities of the polyhedra differ from those of the
corresponding Schwarz triangles: 2 3 4| has density 1 and 2 35 | has density 3, compared
with densities 7 and 9 respectively for the triangles (2.3 4) and (2 35). This discrepancy
can be traced to the fact that the vertex-figures are obtuse-angled, and that in 2 3 4], for
example, all except the hexagonal faces are retrograde. It is possible to imagine a distorted
form of 2 3 4| whose vertex figure is acute-angled and whose density is 7. As this is deformed
into 23 | the hexagonal faces pass through the centre of the polyhedron and the density
becomes |7—8|=1.
