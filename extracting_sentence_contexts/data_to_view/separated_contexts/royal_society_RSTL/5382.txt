The theory at present acted upon, proceeds on the assumption that there are only
two resistances in a beam, namely, tension and compression ; but this supposition fails
to account, not only for the strength, but also for the visible changes of figure which
arise under transverse strain. If abde (fig. 3) represent the centre portion of a solid rectangular beam before any

transverse strain, the beam being supposed to be supported at the centre F. and loaded
at its extremities.
- In this change of figure it will be observed that there are three effects ;—
- First, an extension of the fibres or particles, commencing at the neutral axis lm.
and increasing to the upper portion of the beam.
© Secondly, a compression of the fibres or particles from the neutral axis to the lower
portions of the beam ; and

Thirdly, the planes or surfaces alc and bmd are forced downwards to the distance ep,
wo and fg. There are, in fact, two distinct changes of figure :—

-Ehere is the change produced by the tension and compression, which, if acting alone,
ould result in the figure efhg; and there is the change produced by curvature, which,
acting alone, would result in the figure {pnorm. The effect produced by the curva-
Ls is, to cause the sides or planes bd and ac to descend parallel to themselves; the
Aect produced by the tension and compression 1s, to cause these planes to turn about
Ke neutral axis. The combination of these effects is necessary to produce the figure
Thich a beam asswmes when placed under transyerse strain ; and the changes of figure
int out distinctly the nature of the resistances.
