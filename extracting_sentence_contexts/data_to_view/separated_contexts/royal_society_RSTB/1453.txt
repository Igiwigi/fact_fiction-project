The only difference is that the final loss of irritability produced by isobutyl-
Sildoxime is reached somewhat earlier than that produced by isonitrosoacetone. 2 As previously pointed out, the inverse relationship exists between isonitrosoacetone
spn propylaldoxime, and whilst thus occupying a position between these two aldoximes,
‘Bhe toxicity of isonitrosoacetone more nearly approaches that of the isobutyl compound. Bhis latter fact may be further illustrated by fig. 55.
