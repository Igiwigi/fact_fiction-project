on Bitumen in stones. Â© 527

bituminous and vitrifiable, agglutinate, and form substances
resembling pumice, is a 8ubject which may throw some light
upon the natural formation of that substance.

The conversion of obsdzan into a species of pumice, and the
proof that it contains bitumen, will probably be considered
as supporting the mineralogical arrangement, which places
that curious substance in connection with pitch-stone.

As it appears from the facts here detailed that bitumen, or
a volatile inflammable oil, exists in considerable proportion,
and in chemical union, with all the rocks of the Floetz Trap
formation, is it a far-fetched mference to consider that forma-
tion as the chief source, whatever its own origin may have
been, of the ejected volcanic products ?

The appearance of an inflammable substance in the lower
or elder rocks, such as mica, slate, &c, and, in particular, the
exception in favour of colourless rock crystal and adularia,
will probably obtain the attention of geologists,

It is observable also, that in the last named rocks, the
