If correction is made for the difference in the densities of these liquids the positic
of some of the nitrites of small molecular weight would probably be lowered, and
nearer approximation obtained to an order corresponding with that of the homologe
series.

It is, however, remarkable that in most cases an increase in the quantity of nitrit
administered does not lead to tke corresponding increase in the reduction of bl
pressure which we should expect, in fact the relatively powerful action of sm
quantities of these compounds is very extraordinary.

The differences in the boiling-points of the liquids do not seem to exercise am
important influence on the extent to which they reduce blood-pressure. Those boilin
at lower temperatures do not act more rapidly.

The amount of nitroxyl present in the compdund evidently does not here, a
more than in the action of the pulse, condition the physiological activity.
tertiary butyl and amyl nitrites, though containing much less nitroxyl than
nitrites of ethyl and propyl, are the most active. With certain exceptions the powe
ot reducing blood-pressure increases with the molecular weight, and, therefore, wit
the introduction of the methyl group. The conclusion arrived at in connection witl
