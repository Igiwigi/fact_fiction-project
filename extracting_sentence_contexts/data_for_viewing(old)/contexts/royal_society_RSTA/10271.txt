for the allotropy of silver in the form in which he prepared the metal. We proceed
to examine these arguments.

In the first place, then, all Carey Lxa’s silver films were prepared from silver
suspensions. He claims that these suspensions were “true solutions,” and that the
ability of the silver to remain in solution in water was evidence that the molecules of
the silver in question differed from those of normal silver, or, in other words, the
silver was in an allotropic form. We are now, however, familiar with the fact that
particles of normal silver, as of many other metals, are able, in consequence of mutual
electrostatic repulsions,* to keep themselves in suspension in quite pure water.
Again, we have seen that, when a silver solution is prepared by Brepie’s method, its
refractive index is that which is possessed by a suspension of small spheres, but not
of molecules, of silver in water,t and in the same case there is a strong absorption
band at exactly that point of the spectrum at which small spheres, but not molecules,
of silver in water would produce a maximum ;{ so that in this case the greater part
of the silver is certainly present in the form of small spheres. Further, if, when
prepared by deflagration, silver in suspension in water takes the small sphere form, it
is primd facie probable that it does the same when obtained by Carry Lxa’s
method,§ and this probability is increased by the fact that Cargzy Lxa’s silver
suspensions exhibited the same red, yellowish-red, and yellow colours which are
