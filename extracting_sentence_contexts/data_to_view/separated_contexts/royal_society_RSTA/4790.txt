Determination of the Period. a
The method we have followed hitherto has enabled us to express the displacements
a any point of the body by means of two arbitrary constants 0,, 0,, but the
antity \, whose value it is our chief object to determine, has entirely disappeared. e have, in fact, verified that: the equations (7), (8), and the boundary conditions (9) Â§e approximately satisfied by the forms (28), while to the same order zero is the
a@proximate value of A. We require now to have recourse to .a method which will
@iable us to carry our approximations to the value of \ further.
