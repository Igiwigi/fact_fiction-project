As a matter of fact, in the
particular case, taking e as 0, this quantity is equal to 8°24. If, on the other hand, d is less than 1, then the quantity 2b —1-+ e in the two
equations above must be replaced by b)-+1-+e, a quantity necessarily positive ;
hence, whether 0 is less than or greater than 1, the circuit cannot be too large. If the same process that has been followed in finding the best conditions with respect
to weight be employed to find them with respect to moment of inertia, a difficulty
arises in consequence of the fact that the upper end or cross wire of the circuit has a
resistance which depends upon its length simply, while it has a moment of inertia which
is only one-third of what it would have if it were placed alongside of one of the side
wires of the circuit. Thus, while the expression for 7 remains as before, viz.,
(21+1-+e)v +a, that for the moment of inertia of the wire will be {(62 + 8e
+ 1)/12} wa. If with these values the attempt is made to find the best values for a
and / with respect to moment of inertia, a complicated cubie equation results and
symmetrical expressions can no more be obtained.
