The structure of the ocean basins is one of the most outstanding problems of geology. The
fact that the rocks which form the floor of the ocean are not directly accessible for investiga-
tion renders its solution a matter of considerable difficulty. Until recently, almost the only
data available were derived from soundings and bottom samples, but the development of
geophysical methods now provides means by which additional information can be ob-
tained. One of the most notable advances was the development, by Professor F. A. Vening
Meinesz, of the submarine pendulum apparatus which enables accurate measurements of
gravity to be made at sea. More recently, the application of the seismic technique has pro-
vided another powerful means of investigation. In 1935, Professor M. Ewing (Ewing, Cary
& Rutherford 1937) used this method to study the structure of the continental shelf on the
Atlantic seaboard of the United States. His results indicated that although the depth of the
water only increased very gradually out to the 100-fathom line, the underlying basement
rock, as it may be called, shelved more steeply, and near the edge of the shelf was overlaid
by many thousands of feet of less compacted sediments. This work was soon followed by
