avoid parallax, to the drawings to be measured; such an arrangement will neither conceal
and confuse the drawings nor unduly dazzle the eye. The circles first enable the position
of the plate to be adjusted so that the primordia under examination are spaced outwards
from their centre as uniformly as possible, and then provide the scale to measure the
primordial distances from this point. It appears probable that a similar method could be
used to measure the sections directly through the microscope; for this purpose the photo-
graphic reduction would need to be considerably greater, to a size suitable for an eyepiece
graticule; the circles might be printed on film and this mounted between cover-slips.

When determining plastochrone ratios oblique sections should be avoided as far as
possible. Single determinations of r (e.g. derived from the distances from the centre of
primordia 1 and 2, or of 2 and 3) are subject to considerable error, owing largely to the
fact that the primordia compared are situated in very different azimuths; one region of an
apex may differ slightly from another in its growth and irregularities persist sufficiently long
to be reflected in the phyllotaxis pattern; obliquity of the sections would produce a similar
effect. Hence measurements in radial directions inclined to one another at only small
angles are preferable. In Fibonacci phyllotaxis this means that primordia differing in age
by 2, or better by 3, 5, 8, etc., plastochrones should be compared, according to the height
of the system. If now the radial distances of two primordia differing by three plasto-
chrones be measured, the plastochrone ratio is given by the cube root of the ratio of the
measurements.

A better estimate could be obtained by finding log r as given by each of the pairs of
primordia 1 and 4, 2 and 5, 3 and 6, and taking the mean of the three derived estimates
before converting to phyllotaxis index. Finally, in order to achieve the greatest accuracy a
