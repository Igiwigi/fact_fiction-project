Here the Millstone
Grit is about 3000 ft. thick, but it appears that some of the lower beds are missing. To the
west of the Pennines at Formby near Southport, a borehole proved over 1000 ft. of Millstone
Grit of marine facies, the evidence suggesting that originally at least 6000 ft. were present,
much having been removed by post-Carboniferous erosion (Kent 1948). These and similar facts make it appear likely that the Lower Carboniferous land surface
sloped down from the North Derbyshire area to a basin of deposition occupying the Lanca-
shire and Cheshire plain. It is probable therefore that sedimentation was continuous here
from the Lower Carboniferous into the Millstone Grit, and that the thickness of sediments
deposited in the Nook and Astley Green region was at least as much as is met with in North
Derbyshire; that is to say, it was at least 3000 ft. The beginning of the Lower Carboniferous
period was marked by a gradual marine transgression.
