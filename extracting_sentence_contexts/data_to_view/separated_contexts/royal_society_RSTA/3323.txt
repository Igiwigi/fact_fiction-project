In particular, we have studied the DDO of phenol via breaking of the
C-OH bond and oxygen removal. The assumption is that Ru nanoparticles of size below 1-2 nm
are present on the surface. In fact, the surface of large Ru particles is very active and leads to C-
OH bond scission with similar and even lower energy barriers [12]. In this case, it is assumed that,
in the presence of hydrogen, the reaction proceeds towards full HYD. In analogy with the study
of ZrO; in the ketonization process, see above, three different forms of anatase TiO? have been
considered: (i) the ideal stoichiometric (101) surface; (ii) the same surface reduced by H addition
and formation of Ti*+ radical ions; and (iii) the surface with one O vacancy and two Ti5+ centres.
