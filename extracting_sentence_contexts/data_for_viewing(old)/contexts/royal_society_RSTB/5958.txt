as a contribution towards the biology of one of the strangest of sea creatures.

The chief interest centres around the metamorphosis, cataclysmic in its rapidity
and astonishing in the profound changes it brings about within a few seconds. In
this respect a few other larvee resemble it, the most familiar of them being the Actino-
trocha, and more especially the endo-larva of Polygordius lacteus, so fully and carefully
described by WoLtTEeRECcK (1902). Throughout the following pages frequent comparison
will be made with this Polygordius larva, and it should be understood that unless
otherwise stated, a reference to Polygordius means to the endo-larva of P. lacteus.

This paper is by no means an exhaustive account. The cleavage and very early stages
have not been studied, and, as will become apparent later, these stages probably hold
the key to the explanation of several puzzling facts. The study starts with the fully
formed trochosphere and finishes with the young worm a few weeks after metamor-
phosis. Nor has it been possible during this period of the life-history to fill in all the
details; size alone has been a great handicap when studying the smaller structures.
The larva at its maximum size is very small—a mere half-millimetre across the compara-
tively large prototroch—and only an eighth the bulk of Polygordius. Failure to
ascertain details is possibly as much due to inability to see with the highest powers as to
faulty technique.

The terminology used for the parts and the spatial relations of the larval organs is
based on WoOLTERECK’s 1902 paper. Terms of position are used as far as possible in
