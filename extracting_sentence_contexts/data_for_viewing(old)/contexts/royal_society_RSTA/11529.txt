Remarks on this table seem unnecessary, as they so plainly indicate the guiding
factor in the extinction.

This, perhaps, is one of the most curious results that have been obtained, for it is
hard to conceive that the area of the retina impressed should not be a factor. The
experiments clearly show that the estimate of small intensities of light by their
effect on the light-perceiving apparatus is not a simple matter. The extinction of
comparatively larger areas of light is most instructive. The light from a square, or
a disc, or an oblong, just before extinction, is a fuzzy patch of grey, and appears
finally to depart almost as a point. This can searcely account for the smallest width
of an illuminated surface determining the intensity of the light just not visible ; but
it tells us that the light is still exercising some kind of stimulus on the apparatus,
even when all sensation of light is gone from the outer portions. The fact
that the disappearance of the image takes place in the same manner, whether
viewed centrally or excentrically, tells us that this has nothing to do with the
yellow spot or fovea, but is probably due to a radiation of sensation (if it may be so
called) in every direction on the retinal surface. Supposing some part of the
stimulus impressed on one retinal element did radiate in all directions over the
surface of the retina, the effect would be greatest in the immediate neighbourhood,
and would be inappreciable at a small distance, but the influence exerted upon an
adjacent element might depend not only on its distance, but also upon whether
it was or was not itself exerted independently. Following the matter out further,
we should eventually arrive at the centre of an area, being the part which was the
recipient of the greatest amount of the radiated stimuli, and consequently that would
be the last to disappear. With a slit aperture, the slit is visible till extinction is
