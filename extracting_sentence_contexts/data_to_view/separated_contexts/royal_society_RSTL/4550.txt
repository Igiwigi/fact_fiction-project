myself, upon the action, at a high temperature, of hydrated oxide of phenyl on am-
monia. In this reaction a small but unequivocal quantity of aniline is formed. The formation of aniline, ethylaniline and diethylaniline, appeared to have esta-
blished in a sufficiently satisfactory manner, the point of theory which is here in
question ; still I thought desirable the acquisition of additional facts in support of
the position to which this inquiry has conducted me. Thus I have been led to study
the action of bromide of ethyl upon several of the derivatives of aniline, and to try
whether other alcohol-radicals, such as methyl and amy], would bave a similar
