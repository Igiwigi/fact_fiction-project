"This change is not only interesting as an additional corroboration of the formula
of the base, but likewise as affording a new source from which triethylamine may be
obtained in a state of perfect purity ; for as I shall show presently, the oxide may be
also prepared from very impure mixtures of the lower ethyl-bases, and even from
ammonia directly.

This, too, deserves to be noticed, as a new instance of the failure of the analogy
between iodide and oxide of ethyl (ether)—a fact which was pointed out long ago by
MM. LavggxT and Gernarpr, and most indubitably demonstrated by the recent
investigations of Dr. WiLL1amson. If the decomposition by heat of oxide of tetre-
thylammonium was perfectly analogous to that of the iodide, we should expect to
se the former $plit into triethylamine and oxide of ethyl (ether).
