this way is

By taking derivatives with respect to u, we can calculate the double occupancy d as a function of
x, and combining this with (3.13) we can study how d changes with e for the different families n. The results are shown in figure 1.

(c) Double occupancy for thermal versus atypical states

It is interesting to compare the behaviour of the double occupancy in thermal states and the
particular family of atypical states as identified above in §3b. We can calculate the energy density
and double occupancy for typical states using the free energy of (3.7) as

(e)p = ale and (d)g= a + e (3.14)
where we have used the fact that we are working at half-filling. This determines d as an implicit
function of e for thermal states. We note that this is of experimental relevance, as recent ultra-
cold atomic experiments are able to directly measure the double occupancy in realizations of
the one-dimensional Hubbard model [41].
