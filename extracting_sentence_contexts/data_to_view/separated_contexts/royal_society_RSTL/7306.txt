$ It secms possible that in some cases the anterior half of the body may survive much longer from a cons
deration. of the following facts. On April 5, 1864, I found in a wide-mouthed bottle containing salt water and
a yery 8mall quantity of a filamentous green seaweed, the anterior balf of a specimen of Oncholarmus vulgarity
quite active in its movements, though presenting no traces of repair. Tt seems almost certain that the injury
to this animal must have been done on or before the 24th of the preceding month (March), since the water and

weed were put into the bottle on that day, and had not been interfered with in the meanwhile.
