This latter
phenomenon, in particular, may lead to a measurable positive shift in the retrieval of the Doppler
width.

4. The carbon dioxide experiment

Figure 1 also indicates that the use of CO2 at 24m wavelength (whose lines belong to the
v1 + 2v2 + v3 combination band) may be advantageous, the A-ratios being larger than those of
ammonia and water. In fact, at a pressure of approximately 100 Pa, this ratio amounts to about
40, which, in conjunction with the fact that collisions are much less effective (the molecule
being non-polar), explains the success of the experiment that immediately followed the first DBT
implementation [54]. In that experiment, the shape of the well isolated R(12) component was
probed at different temperatures, between the TPW and the gallium melting point (302.9146 K),
by using an ECDL. This spectral line was also selected by researchers at the PTB-Braunschweig,
for laser-spectroscopy-based measurement of the amount of substance fraction of CO) in Np
[55].
