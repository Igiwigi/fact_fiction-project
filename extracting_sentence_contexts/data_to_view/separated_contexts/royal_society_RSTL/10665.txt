large extent counteracted by lactic acid, and the subsequent passive s8hortening of th
muscle under the non-balanced action of a strong solution (1 to 500) of the acid. ON THE RELATIVE ACTION OF ALKALIES AND ALKALINE EARTHS ON MUSCLE. We cannot enter here into a full consideration of the antagonism which certain
members of these groups show with regard to the action of other members, but we
may briefly state a few of the most striking facts. Thus potassium shortens the.
lengthened curves of veratria, barium (Plate 10, fig. 43), calcium, 8trontium, of large
doses of sodium and of lithium (Plate 10, fig. 44), and reduces the contracture which -
they have caused. Sodium, which we have shown in large doses to cause a
lengthened curve with increased contraction, adds to the length of calcium and
strontium when applied in strong solutions.
