compared with
0-22in. for the bullet. These facts indicate that Hopkinson’s theory of the effect of the
strength of a bullet on the force which it exerts needs modification in the light of recent work
on the propagation of plastic waves. The curves shown in figure 12 satisfy the momentum relationships, since the value

of [pdt taken over the duration of the pulse is 12-0 x 10°g./cm.sec. when evaluated

from the experimental (/, /) curve and 11-9 x 10% g./cm.sec.
