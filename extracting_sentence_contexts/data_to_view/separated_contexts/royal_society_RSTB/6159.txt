There is some reason to think that the tuberculate surface
of the cast is not the true outer surface of the reniform body and that, if this had been
exposed, the tubercles would not have appeared upon it. A thin dark layer that did
not show tubercles externally was removed from one specimen ; the surface then
exposed showed small circular depressions, while the inner side of the flake of dark
material had corresponding elevations. It is a significant fact also that tubercles
are not evident along the convex margin in any specimen. The question of the
nature of the tubercles cannot be settled satisfactorily from the present material. There is no evidence that they represent contents such as large spores.
