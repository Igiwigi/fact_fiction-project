1. Introduction

Most diseases are associated with genetic mutations or gene expression
abnormalities. The ability to introduce or correct mutations and/or to restore
gene expression of any given gene therefore would allow researchers to inves-
tigate the origins of diseases, and might even provide novel therapeutic options.
The concept of introducing or correcting genetic mutations relies on the fact that
double strand breaks in a living cell will induce mechanisms to repair the break.
Depending on e.g. the cell cycle and chromatin context [1,2], the cell will choose
to repair the damage by non homologous end joining, which can induce inser-
tions/deletions often resulting in inactivation of the gene. The alternative repair
pathway is via homologous recombination, in which the damaged allele is
exchanged with a homologous template. By introducing DNA damage at a
given location in the human genome, one can thus correct mutations or
introduce sequences of interest.

Introduction of DNA damage specifically at one genomic locus requires
programmable DNA-binding platforms, which can be used as gene-targeting
