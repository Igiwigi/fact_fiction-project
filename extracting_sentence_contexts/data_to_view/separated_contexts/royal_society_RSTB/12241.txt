Much work on spindles still needs to be carried out. This
research will not only address some fundamental questions
about the role of sleep but will also open new avenues for clinical
research. In fact, spindles may play a protective role in the cortex
in some forms of epilepsy [166]. Furthermore, spindles are
diminished in schizophrenia patients [167]) and their global
coordination is impaired in mouse models of schizophrenia
[129]. More generally, the covariance of spindles characteristics
with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders
offers a promising use of spindles as a biomarker in neuro-
pathology.
