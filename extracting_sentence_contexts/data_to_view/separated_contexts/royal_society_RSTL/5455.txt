The process in fact amounts to the multi-
plication separately of each term of cd=
1(2?1)+3(21*+10(1*)

by 6=(1). It would perhaps have been proper to employ an analogous rule for the
calculation of the combinations &d”.. not containing 6, but instead of doing s0 I ayailed
myself of the existing Tables (5). But the comparison of the last line of each Table (a)
(which as corresponding to a combination 4” was always calculated independently of the
Tables (6)) with such last line as calculated from the corresponding Table (6), seems to
afford a complete verification of both the Tables; and my process has in fact enabled me
to detect seyeral numerical errors in the Tables (6), as given in the English translation
of the work above referred to. It is not desirable, as regards facility of calculation and
independently of the want of verification, to calculate either set of Tables wholly from
the other; the rules for the independent calculation of the Tables (6) are fully and clearly
explained in the work referred to, and T have nothing to add upon this subject. 'The relation of symmetry, alluded to in the introductory paragraph of the present
memoir, exists in each Table of either set, and is as follows: viz.
