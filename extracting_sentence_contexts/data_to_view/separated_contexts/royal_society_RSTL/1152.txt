When so many eminent chemists concurred in nearly the,
same assertion, I was not a little surprised to observe, in some
experiments (which I made for a very different purpose), that
the whole of the sulphate of ammoniac was not only volati-
lized by heat, but also that the distillation of it was accompa-
nied with some remarkable phanomena. I therefore diluted some very pure concentrated sulphuric
acid with an equal quantity of distilled water, and having sa-
turated it with ammoniac, I gradually evaporated it till it be-
came a concrete salt,

EXPERIMENT I.

I put two ounces of the salt into a glass retort, capable of
containing three times the quantity, then fitted on a receiver
without any Juting, and placed the retort in a small open fur-
nace over some lighted charcoal, ?
