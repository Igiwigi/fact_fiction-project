To the same object must also be attributed the
subdivision of the posterior section of the air-bladder in all normal Siluride: into two
lateral compartments by « vertical longitudinal septum, as well aa the frequent
piesence of secondary transverse septa in wach chamber, such structural features can
searcely have any other effect than that of rendering this portion of the nir-blaudder
ihove inélastic and indistensible than it would othernvise be, and, thevetore, still
frther restricting ull volumetric variations to the anterior chumber ulone, Tt js also
possible tat the presence of lateral cutaneous areas may be related to the increasing
Sensitiveness of the air-bladder of the Siluride to pressure disturbances, if, as

Sacemenn (Joc. ett.) has suggested, the function of these areas ts to enable the air
bladder more promptly to react to pressure oscillations, or, a5 we have surmised, more
readily to allow vaviations in the volume of the contained gases to modify the bulk
and specific gravity of the Fish. The comparative freedom of the anterior vertebra: from snchylosis in the Cyprinule
is obviously velated to the fact that the air-bladder, including the anterior chamber,
lies free in the abdominal cavity, and is searcely, if at all, invested by skeletal ;
elements ; hence. as the bladder is less likely to be affected by any compression which —
may result from the flexure of the vertebral coluton during vigorous locomotor moye-
ments, anchylosis is unnecessary, or at all events does not take place to anything like
the same extent as in the Silurida,

Certain distinctive structural variations in the Siluridm are probably dependent
upon other modifications of a more direct physiological value, and in any comparison
with the Silavidie it is interesting to notice the necessary sequence of particalar
anatomical differences between the two when an initial modification is once started in
one of them. In the Silurids, the restrietton of volumetric variations in the anterior
chamber to its lateral expansion or contruction is in part brought about by the invest-
ment of its dorsal surface by the complex and fifth centra and the expanded arid
otherwise modified transyerse processes of the fourth aud fifth yertebra, which not
only prevents the expansion of the chamber dorsally, and to some extent anteriorly,
but indirectly aids in preventing expansion in other directions by affording thes
necessary surface for the direct attachment of the walls of the chamber to the skeleton
at certain definite points.
