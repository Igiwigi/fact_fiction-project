the collapse of the Atlantic Ocean overturning circulation, or the death of the
Amazon rainforest?

Such questions are complex to answer. They sit at the intersection of a number of
disciplines: atmospheric physics, oceanography, ecosystems science, etc. Notwith-
standing the issues of nonlinearity and chaos in fluid flows such as the atmosphere, the
coupling between physical and biological processes means that it is very difficult (if
not impossible) to develop an elegant theory for answering the key questions posed by
society. We are therefore left with the rather inelegant, but at least practical, solution
of developing numerical models of the climate system that represent the major
processes and their interactions and using those models to make predictions.

The very fact that a team of people can take the fundamental laws of fluid flow,
electromagnetic radiation, etc., approximate the equations, discretize them on a
grid, code them up on a computer and produce a simulation that bears a passing
resemblance to the world we live in is, in retrospect, a significant feat. Yet,
perfectionism dominates and we are quick to point out deficiencies in our simulations
of climate. These deficiencies, often called model errors (although perhaps better
called as model imperfectionsâ€”they are not simple coding slip-ups that can be easily
corrected but rather fundamental limitations that arise owing to finite computer-
processing capacity) reduce our confidence in the projections we make of future
climate with those models. Model imperfections, coupled with fundamental
limitations on the initial-value prediction of chaotic weather and the unknown
path that society may take in terms of future emissions of greenhouse gases, imply
that it is not possible to be certain about future climate.
