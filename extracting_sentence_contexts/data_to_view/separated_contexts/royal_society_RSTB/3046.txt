HISTOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS ON INTUMESCENCES, ETC. 239

intumescences (while still attached to the growing plant) was darkened for four days
and five nights, and at the end of that time the oil and starch were as abundant as at
the beginning of the experiment.

2. Hemispherical Outgrowths.â€”By far the greater number of outgrowths belong
to this type, which has accordingly been already described by various authors in a
considerable number of species. Some new facts have, however, been observed in the course of the present
investigations. Intumescences of this type consist of both epidermal and mesophyll
cells, and are of two kinds, each kind having a different pathological effect upon the
plant which bears it. In the one kind (a) the cells of the outgrowth, both the
mesophyll cells and those of the epidermis, are in uninterrupted connection, and no
rupture of the tissues occurs.
