Acting
by u_¢ on Z; would achieve this, but only in a trivial manner, because the composite ii—; 0 ily is
simply the identity on Y, independent of t. Clearly, we need a different construction. We make use of the fact that the context V is isomorphic to the context u;Vu_; as a commutative
von Neumann algebra. Gelfand duality [3] implies that ¥, is isomorphic to Y\. Concretely,
let us write

Vu

Uyy : V — upVu_t (35)
a> u;au_y ,

for the isomorphism between the unital, Abelian von Neumann algebras V and u;Vu_;.
