sections through the sorus, and as the consecutive steps of development were not
stringently compared, so as to elicit the mode of progression from one to another, and
to show the exact origin of the sporogenous tissue, it is plain that much yet remained

to be done. Gorse (‘ Bot. Zeit.,’ 1881, p. 685) briefly notes his own observations on
Marattia cicutefolia and alata, aid states that, as regards the archesporium, there is
a complete similarity to that of Angiopteris, and that the archesporium is referable
in origin to a single cell. He further regards the separate origin of the archesporia
as evidence of the whole synangium being a sorus, and not a septate sporangium ; in
his outlines of classification (Engl. Ed., p. 254) he remarks that the fact of each
sporangium having its own archesporium “ proves that in Maratiia, as in Angiopleris,
we have two rows of distinct sporangia, which have grown together by their lateral
faces.” We shall inquire subsequently whether the facts are always as stated, and
secondly whether this conclusion is really justified.

Since Marattia is a middle type of the family, it was thought useful to trace the
origin and development of the sorus with the greater care, for purposes of comparison
on the one hand with Danaea and Kaulfussia, and on the other with Angiopteris.
Moreover, this could be carried out with greater certainty, owing to a plentiful supply
of growing material of Marattia fraxinea (Smrru), which allowed of the earliest stages
being traced.
