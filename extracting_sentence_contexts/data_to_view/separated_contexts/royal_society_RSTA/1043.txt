The platinum temperatures
obtained from the readings of T, and T, had to be corrected by — 0-012° Pt., of which
—0-010° Pt. was due to the difference in the heating effect of a current of 0-004-amp. on the thermometer wire under the conditions of calibration in the bath of stirred
water and under the conditions of use in the stirred air of the apparatus enclosure. The additional correction of — 0-002° Pt. arises from the fact that a comparison at
50° C. of the indications of T, and T, with those of standard thermometers of known 3
showed that the value of 5 for T, and T, was somewhat higher than that for 0. A
correction of — 0-002° Pt. is sufficient to adjust this difference at 20° C. Platinum
temperatures were corrected to values in terms of degrees Centigrade on the Inter-
national Temperature Scale by means of a conversion table, based on the usual formula
(t — ty) = 5.t ((— 100) 104 for a value of 3 = 1-500, which was supplied by the
Physics Department of the Laboratory. Readings of the barometer gauge and its associated thermometers are shown in the
section of Table XIX devoted to pressure measurements.
