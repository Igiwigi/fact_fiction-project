The broken curve B’ is calculated from d = er 5

Although the deflection corresponding to a given value of 7 is greater in the B curve
than the A curve, it must not be inferred that the sound was louder in the former
case. The deflection obtained depends not only on the loudness of the sound but also
on the sensitivity to which the amplifier is adjusted and which can be varied over a very
wide range. As a matter of fact the sound was louder in the A than in the B
experiment. It may also be noted that in both cases the sound was louder than in
the Wheatstone’s Bridge experiment. To sum it up, it may be said that the available evidence points to the fact that, when
the microphone is employed with an amplifier‘and vibration galvanometer and only very
faint sounds are observed, the deflection shown by the galvanometer is approximately
proportional to the amplitude of the sound.
