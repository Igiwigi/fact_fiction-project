Special attention was paid to studying the Turing bifurcation near the Andronov—Hopf
bifurcation boundary [16-19]. In particular, it was shown that diffusion can transform
homogeneous oscillatory modes into heterogeneous oscillations or suppress them entirely to
form a stationary pattern. To simulate self-organization processes as best as possible, one has to
take into account the effect of random perturbations in a dynamical system, where the interplay
between nonlinearity and stochasticity can cause many unexpected phenomena [20-24]. Among
them, we should mention noise-induced phase transitions [25-29] and stochastically forced self-
organization [13,30,31]. Despite the fact that noise is caused by random processes, it often helps
to establish a relative order in dynamical systems. Since respective models for studying self-
organization are nonlinear and stochastic, analytical approaches are quite limited; therefore,
asymptotic computational methods should be used [32].

In the present paper, we study the nonlinear predator-prey dynamical model [33,34]. We
show that adding diffusion in this originally monostable system induces multiple coexisting
spatial structures, thus resulting in multistability. In §2, we analyse the deterministic spatially
distributed predator-prey population model within the Turing instability zone, where pattern
formation is possible. The multistable behaviour is demonstrated with examples of various
stable spatial heterogeneous structures. In addition, the peculiarities of temporal dynamics of
pattern generation are analysed by the waveform pattern modality. Section 3 is devoted to
stochastic phenomena, namely, noise-induced transitions between coexisting patterns in the
