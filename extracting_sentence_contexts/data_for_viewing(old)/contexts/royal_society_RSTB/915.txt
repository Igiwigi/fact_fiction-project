Empletely overlooked were it not for the brilliant rose tint which their granules take

ith methylene-blue. This condition is shown in figs. 4 and 5a.

The injection of micro-organisms is followed by a continuous increase in the

umber of these cells, and they now appear as shown in fig. 5B. The increase is a

ing fact from the second to the fortieth hour. Beyond that time we have not
lowed them.

3 To state the same fact in other words, the rose-staining cells are continuously
tracting some substance or substances from the plasma and depositing it within
emselves as rose-staining (basophile) granules. For the present we are content to

suggest that the substances abstracted are foreign, abnormal substances in solution,

such as, for instance, the poisonous products of bacterial activity. Frequently,
watching the processes taking place in a drop-culture, one sees the eosinophile cells
at first vigorously attacking the bacteria, and then the whole process will come, some-
times almost abruptly, to a standstill, the eosinophile cells contracting and becoming
spherical, while the hyaline cells disintegrate. This, we explain, by supposing that
the bacterial poison in small doses stimulates the eosinophile cells, while in larger
