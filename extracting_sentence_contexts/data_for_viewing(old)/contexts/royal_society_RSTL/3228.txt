OF SEVERAL EQUIVALENT NUMBERS. 23

in the process, there are several others to be observed to ensure snccess. As Â£00n as
the action commences, the flask should be removed from the sand bath, and the de-
compoxition be permitted to continue without heat. When the action slackens, the
flask may be returned to the sand bath, and 80 on, to and from the source of heat.
until it is 80 gentle that no lateral spirting can be feared. The adaptation of a re-
ceiver throughout the whole of these operations must be strictly attended to; for de-
$pite every care, a minute portion of the solution will sometimes be ejected during
the eyaporation. This cireumstance happened in three of the experiments I shall
mention presently. In one case the weight was 003 of a grain, in another *008,
and in a third -005. The receiver flask should not be detached from the other even
while removing them to and from the sand bath, nor in fact until the resulting chlo-
ride is nearly dry, as slight action continues during the greater part of the evapora-
tion.

31. Very particular attention was paid to the purity of the salt employed. It was
prepared from the common purified nitre of the shops, by four repeated crystalliza-
tions from distilled water. After each crystallization the salt was dried, and finely
powdered, and this powder well washed with distilled water. When finally washed
and dried, 200 grs. werefused in a platina crucible. They yielded a perfectly colour-
less mass, 80luble in water without a trace of insoluble matter, and the solution was not.
affected by nitrate of silver, chloride of barium, oxalate of ammonia, or hydrosuIphuret
of ammonia. It was dried by careful fusion. The resulting chloride was dried in the
same way as the chloride from chlorate. From one to two fluid ounces of hydro-
