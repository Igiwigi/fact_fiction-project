MR. J. LISTER ON THE BARLY STAGES OF INFLAMMATION. 689

\nized in consequence of the changes of calibre which they produce in the vessels ;
and the manner in which the arteries are affected in a congested part of the web indi-
cates that the muscular, like the pigmentary tissue, has its functional activity impaired
by a certain amount of irritation. Thus T have repeatedly been struck with the fact,
and noted it before I knew its significance, that an artery running through a limited
area on which an irritant has acted, remains dilated in the Spot, although it may vary in
other parts of its course. This I have observed in one experiment with mustard, in one
with acetic acid, in two with ammonia, and in one with heat. In the last-mentioned
case the appearance was particularly striking, from the circumstance that two arteries
happened to pass through the burnt part, and were constricted to absolute closure in the
SA rest of their course, contrasting strongly with their fully dilated state within the area.
