In two of our first experiments with box-wood' charcoal;

the calculations gave us in one case 29,75 parts of carbon in
100 of carbonie acid, and-in the other 30,68; but'we were not
then fully aware of the absorption of water by charcoal, which
rendered the quantity of real carbon employed less than in-
dicated by the weight. Also in another experiment, in which 4
grains of diamond were consumed, the calculation gave us 29,96
per cent. of diamond in carbonic acid ; but apprehending that
a slight degree of inaccuracy had crept into this experiment,
we have not detailed it with the rest; but we have thought it
right to give a simple statement of matters of fact; in no'one
instance have we endeavoured to strain or accommodate these
to suit any particular theory, being fully aware that every ex-
periment, carefully made and faithfully recorded, will remain
an immutable truth to. the end of -time, while hypotheses are
constantly varying, and even the most beautiful theories arc
{6 to change,

The experiments above related give us the following results, Â©
