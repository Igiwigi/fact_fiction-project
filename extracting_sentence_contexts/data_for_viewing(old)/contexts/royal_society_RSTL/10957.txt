= perfected by the maxillary, which has a stump of bone in the jugal region ; the canal-
= wall for the infraorbital nerve is itself perforated. The lachrymal (7) is melted into

5 the fore edge of the maxillary, and the sphenoidal wings, front and hinder (0.s., o.s.),

2 are all confluent with the overlying membrane-bones ; s0 also are the palatine bony

Z tracts with the bones above them. In the inner and lower face of the undefined orbit,

Z the sphenoidal fissure (IT., Vb2.) is geen as a large channel, opening obliquely ; this is

Z queto the fact that the alisphenoid (al.s.) embraces the orbitosphenoid (0.5.), growing

g freely outside it.

p= The eurious, low-lying, oblong squamosal (s9.) opens in front as two short blunb

S blades, which seem to bite the outspread alisphenoid ; this is due to the fact that,

Y whilst the jugal process is aborted and has no jugal bone to lie upon, the condyle

S (glenoid cavity) has become snbdivided into two tracts of articular cartilage, one

& above and one below. Thus the two-faced condyloid head of the lower jaw
