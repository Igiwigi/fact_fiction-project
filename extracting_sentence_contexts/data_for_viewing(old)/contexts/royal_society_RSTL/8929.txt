vestibular floor is gently convex, and is of less extent than the upper snrface of the
capsule, where the semicircular canals are imbedded; it retires most laterally, on
account of the tegmen, but in front also, where the pedicle of the mandible runs (pd.),
and also behind, where the 9th and 10th nerves (9, 10) pass out. 'The pedicle is much
narrower, and clings close to the fore face of the capsule, as it passes into the tra-
becula (t7.), beneath the 5th nerve (5). But if the upper part of the pedicle is thin and
narrow, its lower part is thick and broad; and it is the great distinctness of this tract of
cartilage, and the special facet or condyle upon it (c.pd.), which beguiled me in my early

* Whilst carefully expressing my indebtedness to Professor Huxrzy for taking up this subject, and seizing
by instinet, as it were, upon the erroneous parts of my description, I yet hold, most tenaciously, to my old
view as to the homologies of tho parts; namely, that the © stapes” is a periotic, and the whole, complex * colu-
mella” a hyoidean element. The fact that the stapes is formed ont of the already chondrified periotic wall in
the © Urodela,” as is most plainly geen in young Axolotls 24 inches long, settles the stapedian homology;
that the columella of the Batrachia is the homologue of the hyomandibular of Proteus, T have not the shadow
of a doubt.

plate viii. figs. 1-4, ©.hm.,—* infra-hyomandibular,” the erroneous name I gave to it).
Even the fact that this tract was ossified by a bony plate (in the Common Frog and
Bull-frog), which I correctly designated as the © metapterygoid,” did not undeceive me.
