Check readings of (ii) were frequently taken, particularly when the orientation of the
spheroid was altered. ‘The statie pressure reading, however, did not vary as the spheroid
was moved.

19. Again, it is obvious from the nature of the motion that v is not constant for every
point on the spheroid. For example, if the nose of the spheroid points inwards, as in
the case of an airship in curvilinear flight, the radius of the circle described by the
forward end of the major axis is less than that of the circle described by the after-end.
Hence v, also varies, so that the centrifugal pressure of the air in the tube on the model
is not quite balanced by the centrifugal pressure of the air in the tube connected to the
static pressure tube, and a correction has to be applied. The results, as presented, include
(a) this correction, (6) the density correction, (c) a correction arising from the fact that
the static pressure reading was not accurately }pv,2, and (d) the swirl correction. The
pressures given represent the normal pressure divided by $V, where V is the speed of
the centre of the spheroid, and is constant for all attitudes of the spheroid when the
angular velocity of the arm is constant. It should be noted, however, that as in § 15

it was not possible to repeat accurately any particular speed : the speed quoted is, there-
fore, the mean of a number, each of which approximates very closely to the mean. The
actual speed has, of course, been used in calculating the coefficients. Further, in view of
the fact that the pressures have been divided by V* and not by v*, there area few points
