The method of etching consisted of alternate applications of concentrated and very
dilute nitric acid. In some cases, where very deep etching was required, an electrolytic
method was used. One of the great advantages of dealing with a metal like lead
arises from the large size of its crystals; by enabling us to use deep etching it allows
all fine polishing to be dispensed with, and it becomes possible to obtain micro-
photographs at low magnifications, and under oblique light, which exhibit clearly the

various changes in crystalline structure.

The low power required is a further advantage in view of the fact that an etched
lead surface must be kept wet with an acid solution while it is being examined and
photographed, as such a surface becomes dull and useless as soon as it dries.

To identify the areas which were to be kept under observation, we marked them
by scratches or furrows made with a steel point. Unsymmetrical patterns of marking
were used for this purpose to facilitate replacing the specimen in its former position
and orientation. It is an essential precaution in taking micro-photographs under
oblique illumination which are to serve for purposes of comparison, that the
orientation of the specimen and the angle of incidence of the light should be
constant throughout the entire series. Our micro-photographic arrangements
enabled us to comply with these conditions to a considerable degree of accuracy.
