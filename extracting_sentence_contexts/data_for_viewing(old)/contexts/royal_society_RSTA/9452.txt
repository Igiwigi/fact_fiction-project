C,H,+0, = 200+2H,.

It has also been shown that the addition to such a mixture of hydrogen
sufficient to bring its composition up to C,H,+0,+H,, does not cause any separation
of carbon on explosion, although there results a slight condensation of steam on
cooling.*

That the above facts do not really imply a preferential combustion of carbon (as
some have supposed) was proved by a study of the behaviour of a mixture 3C,H,+20,,
which on explosion gives rise to large quantities of both carbon and steam,
together with methane, acetylene, hydrogen and oxides of carbon. Indeed, the
facts harmonise very well with the hydroxylation theory, which would require the

H.C.OH

intermediate formation of monohydroxyethylene a , a substance which on

thermal decomposition would yield H,O and : CH residues, the latter subsequently
either (i.) undergoing hydrogenation to CH, in an atmosphere sufficiently rich in
