of excitation of each of these is therefore only half of that produced by yawing rotations.
Furthermore, their timing relative to each other is different, the interval between them
being always approximately half a cycle.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS FROM NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS

In spite of the difficulty in analyzing oscilloscope records from a haltere nerve containing
a large number of nerve fibres, the experimental results show a definite effect of rotations
in yaw and roll at a rate of about 1 revolution per sec., and these effects are in accordance
with the theoretical expectations. The identity of the spikes on the records with volleys
from particular groups of sensilla could only be verified from experiments with single nerve
fibres, and these have not proved possible with a nerve consisting of a mass of non-medul-
lated fibres enclosed overall in a tough sheath. The following facts, however, are established:

(1) In the absence of rotation the nerve discharge consists of single or closely grouped
volleys of impulses occurring twice per cycle of oscillation. Alternate volleys may be
unequal in size.

(2) During rotations in the yawing plane, these volleys break up into three main spikes
whose temporal separation increases as the rotation speeds up, producing finally a confused
jumble of spikes.

(3) During rolling rotations the original volleys remain distinct, and two new volleys
arise at points corresponding approximately to one-quarter and three-quarters of a cycle
of oscillation.
