IX. Conditions Determining Discharge.

In order that a lightning discharge may begin, it is clear that the electric force
must somewhere exceed the sparking limit, which amounts at the ordinary
atmospheric pressure to about 100 electro-static units or 3,000,000 volts per metre ; it
is not necessary that the electric force along the whole length of the path of discharge
should previously have approached the sparking limit. As Larmor has pointed out,*
if we suppose that an initial discharge occurs along a narrow line of length
equal to the distance (possibly very small) over which the sparking value of the
electric force was originally exceeded, and that this approximately equalises the
potential along its path, there will be concentration of charge and intense local fields
at the ends of this line; the discharge will thus be lengthened. The conditions are
in fact momentarily much the same as if a conducting wire were placed along the
path of this initial discharge. ‘The maximum value of the electric force at the ends
of the conducting track of the initial discharge will thus greatly exceed the critical

value and will continue to do so as the track lengthens, so that the discharge may
finally extend far beyond the boundary of the region in which the critical electric
force was originally exceeded. Consider a stratiform cloud in which vertical separation
of positive and negative electricity is taking place so that opposite charges are
