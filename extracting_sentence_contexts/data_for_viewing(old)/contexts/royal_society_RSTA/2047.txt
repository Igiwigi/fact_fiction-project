equation (3.29) will take the following form:

ac | aC PC
oop t ax 79x TORO (3.31)
where
A+ yA” A+6A”
“Teear’ *" Pe 62)

Since ye[0.5, 1), then w=O(1) and parameter ¢ is usually small. The smallness of ¢ is due to
the fact that A<1 and Pe=O(1). An approximate solution of equation (3.31) with conditions
(2.57)-(2.59) can be easily constructed by using the fact that parameter ¢ is small (using method of
perturbations). However, equation (3.31) with conditions (2.57)-(2.59) admits the exact solution.
