In the ease of the second series with the bright line, Dr. Macponeut (2) and I (1)
have changes slightly for the better in our judgments between the 266 first experi-
ments and the 258 second experiments; but having regard to the probable errors
given for 260 experiments, it may be doubted whether these changes are significant. Dr. Ler (3) has, however, a quite significant change for the worse. The fact that in some cases the personal equation grows less, in others greater, in
the second half of the series seems to indicate that the changes in personal equation
were by no means due toa secular improvement in judgment.* Nor do they admit
of explanation on the assumption of increasing fatigue due to the exhaustion of the
power of attention. It must be remembered that the experiments were spread out
over a number of days, and this cause would only influence the latter experiments
on each day.
