Regarding the frequency dependence, two possible mechanisms were proposed, one by
Matsuo et al. [31] and the other by Somerday et al. [33]. Matsuo et al. suggested that such a peculiar
frequency dependence is due to the difference in distribution of hydrogen concentration in the
vicinity of the crack tip, thus affecting the HELP process in the crack-tip zone. In fact, they found
that the degree of slip localization at the crack tip was strongly influenced by the test frequency
in JIS-SCM435, as shown in figure 5. Subsequently, to complement the Matsuo et al. study, Yoshikawa et al. [32] investigated the
FCG acceleration in low-carbon steel under the hydrogen gas pressure, py2, ranging from 0.1 to
90 MPa, at frequencies spanning from 0.001 to 10 Hz. Figure 6 plots the relative FCG acceleration
