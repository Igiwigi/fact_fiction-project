wherein @ has also been put equal to zero so that the cable is now supposed to lie on the
bed of the sea. Tt will be seen that the depth D does not enter into the expression for K,. In fact
K, is the induced electric force at a height y above the cable when the depth of the sea
is infinite. Also the way in which D occurs in E, indicates that E, may be regarded
as arising from a source situated at the point y = 2D that is, at a height above the sea
equal to the depth. Thus E, is the electric force representing a reflected disturbance
due to the presence of the upper surface.
