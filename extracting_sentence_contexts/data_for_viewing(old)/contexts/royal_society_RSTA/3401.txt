model is known to exhibit a transition from a paramagnetic to a glassy phase at low temperatures
and a weak transverse field. The classical Ising spin glass model is widely believed to capture
the complicated combinatorial structure of general NP-hard computational problems, while the
zero-temperature, weak transverse-field regime describes the final stage of a quantum annealing
protocol designed to find the ground-state energy of the Ising spin glass. MBL has been argued to
be an obstacle to efficient quantum annealing due to the presence of exponentially closing gaps
in the localized phase.

We computed numerically the many-body mobility edge of the system in the forward
approximation, finding that the energy eigenstates of the system indeed localize for small values
of the transverse field at finite system sizes. When plotted against the equilibrium phase diagram
of the model, we discovered that the localized region does not coincide with the glassy phase.
In particular, evidence points to the fact that the glassy phase is partitioned into a delocalized
region and a localized one. We conjecture that the glassy, delocalized region will exhibit the same
clustering of eigenstates observed in [29] for the p-spin model, where the eigenstates were found
to form clusters inside of which the energies are distributed according to Wignerâ€”Dyson, while
the global distribution of the energy levels of the model is Poissonian.

Moreover, we expect that classical methods that exploit the fine-tuning of thermal relaxation
(such as simulated annealing) will perform poorly in the entire glassy phase, while quantum


annealers will perform poorly only once localization sets in. Therefore, we conjecture that, in the
glassy, delocalized region of the phase space, quantum annealing algorithms can outperform any
classical thermal annealing protocol.
