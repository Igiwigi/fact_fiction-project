readings of similar thermometers placed as stated in the first column. The first re-
sults are those relating to grass; that deduced from grass exposed to three-fourths of
the sky, is about three-fourths of that deduced from grass exposed to the whole of
the sky; and that from long grass is larger than that from short grass. Of all the
snbstances upon which experiments have been made with spirit thermometers, those
on which the lowest readings have occurred were the filamentous, viz. wool and flax,
and they were nearly alike.

'The next class of bodies consisted of metals; of these lead exhibited the lowest
readings in the mean ; but this must have arisen from the circumstance of its having
been generally used on the clearest nights only, during which there was found to be
a very small difference between its readings and that of the thermometer in the re-
flector; in fact in all simultaneous observations it was found that the readings of
the latter thermometer had no advantage over the readings of one placed on lead.

The thermometers which were placed within a few inches of the top of grass ex-
hibited higher readings than those of the last class, and those which were from one
to three inches from the top of grass, generally read the same as that in the reflector.

The reading which most nearly agreed with that in air was on garden mould,
which was.about a mean between that on long grass and that in the air ; these ob-
servations were made on ground undisturbed ; the readings would have been &till
nearer those in the air, had the ground been frequently disturbed 80 as to have been
loose, as it was found in this state to admit the heat to pass more readily from beneath
to the surface.
