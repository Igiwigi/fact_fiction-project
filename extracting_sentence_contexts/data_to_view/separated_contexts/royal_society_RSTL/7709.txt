Thus in the '8uocessive
improvements in artillery, machinery, &., in proportion as the greater sources of imperfection and inaccuracy
are understood and remedied, the number of minor disturbing influences which are thus rendered perceptible,
and Â«till vitiate the results, though to a less extent, increases rapidly. We may even trace a sort of analogy
here in yarious phenomena both of the moral and material universe, which apparently haye no bearing on the
Point wo are considering. Thus the principal wants of human nature, the necessaries of life in fact, are very
few; and 80 long as these are 8upplied with difficulty, minor wants are 8carcely felt, as we 8ee in uncivilized
communities ; but when the greater wants are atisfied, the number and variety of the secondary requirements
of our nature are yisible in the multitudinous productions of civilized life. The diseases which mainly operate in
8hortening human existence are yery fow in number; but could they be extirpated, the number of minor causes,
of nearly coordinate importance, which still would influence the rate of mortality would be very large. =
statistics of crime, and many other phenomena, would give rise to remarks of a similar nature,


THE LAW OF ERRORS OF OBSERVATIONS. 179

this absolutely ; thus it is not enough for our purpose to show, could we do 80 conelusively,

that each error in practice is compounded of a large number of sgmaller errors; we must
also show that they are independent, at least for the most part. Thus we may conceive
one of the minute errors affecting an astronomical magnitude to be an error in the
refraction proceeding from a rise in the general temperature, and another affecting the
same observation to be an error of time arising from the expansion of the pendulum
through the same cause ; now these two minute errors are not independent, and would
have to be mathematically combined in quite a different way from two that were inde-
pendent; and, indeed, such a change of temperature would influence the actual error of
the observation in other ways also.
