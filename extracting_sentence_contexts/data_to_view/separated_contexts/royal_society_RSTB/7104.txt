Partial regulation is not limited in this
way. Discussion of the actual changes of developmental processes involved in regulation meets
a serious limitation, in that the precise actual fates of the reversed-piece and residual
blastoderm are usually unknown. We can often be confident that they have not developed
according to their presumptive fate, but we do not usually know how they have in fact
developed. This is particularly so as regards the development of the anterior end of the
primitive streak. Here the tissue movements are complex and the presumptive areas
crowded, and it is always uncertain whether the changes from normal presumptive fate
which must have occurred were in the reversed-piece only or also in the residual blastoderm.
