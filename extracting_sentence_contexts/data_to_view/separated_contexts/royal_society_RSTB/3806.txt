On the other hand, there is no
special merit in trying to force the ovulate cone into strict morphological homology
with the staminate one, since nothing is gained by doing so. If definite evidence can
be obtained that it is quite a distinct formation, that evidence must be accepted. The bi-axial hypothesis holds because there is no real evidence against it, that is to
say, it is the simplest statement of the facts of observation (ef. SyKEs, 1910, p. 208). With regard to the floral axis itself, however, the facts are sufficiently simple and
clear, if their interpretation has been often obscure and involved.
