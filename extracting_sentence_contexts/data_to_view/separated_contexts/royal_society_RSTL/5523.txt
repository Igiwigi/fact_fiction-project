or, reducing as before, and observing that 7; is equivalent to

(ﬆin 0) (F) (m9),
we have, finally,

«,=(5in0)-"(5in045n0)" (sn0(4) (5n0)*(c2; ON = AK - (34)

If in this expression we put 0 for the result of all but one of the operations indicated in
the last term, we reproduce the form (21.) obtained in art. 9, which appears in fact to
be always complete. The form (34.), however, as before remarked, will never contain
superfluous constants.

20. It is an interesting question whether the forms thus obtained on the supposition
that # is an integer, are not really general, inasmuch as they are expressible without
reference to that supposition.
