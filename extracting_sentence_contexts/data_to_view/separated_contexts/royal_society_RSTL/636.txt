The obser-
vations to which they may give rise, are sufficiently interesting
to engage their attention, and induce them to bestow particular
care on their inquiries concerning them, as such inquiries may
perhaps tend to increase our knowledge respecting the nature of
copper, and also of iron. But I cannot too strongly recommend
to those chemists who may engage in the research, to be very
particular in the choice of the specimens they make use of, and
also to make a great number of experiments, that they may
serve as objects of comparison to each other. Having very favourable opportunities of examining, and com-
paring with each other, the different kinds of copper ore that
are found in the county of Cornwall, (which county furnishes a
greater variety of combinations of that metal than any other part
of Europe, several of which are peculiar to it,) it was impossible
that my attention should not be attracted by the many in-
teresting facts that came under my observation, Next to the
combinations of this metal with the arsenical acid, the study'of
its sulphurets has been the principal object of my pursuits; and,
if future circumstances should concur with my wishes in that
respect, I hope I $hall have it in my power to present to the
public the result of my observations on those sulphurets. Â© Thoxe observations will, I trust, furnish additional proofs of
the truth of a circumstance respecting which I have long ceased
to have any doubts, and which I have already, on various occa-
sions, (particularly in my description of the arseniates of cop-
per,) attempted to establish, namely, that there exist many
minerals, which differ in species, although they have the same

substance, or collection of substances, for their basis, and are
combined with the same modifying substance ; and that the
difference between these minerals, arises merely from the dif-
ferent proportions of their basis, and of their modifying sub=
stance, The more I study the works of nature, the more I
become persuaded of the truth of the above remark; I am also
convinced, that a want of attention to this circumstance has led
mineralogists to confound one species with another. If to the above cause of error we add that which is occasioned
by neglecting, in the analysis of these substances, to distinguish
those parts which (by their chemical combination and mode of
attraction) determihe the particular nature of the substance
analysed, from those which.
