The lower flooding horizon (90 cm.) corresponds with big changes in the
tree-pollen curves, and terminates a minor phase of agricultural activity; the upper flooding horizon
(30 cm.) corresponds with small changes only in the tree pollen, but terminates a phase of much
greater agricultural activity.

which I am speaking: the period between 350 B.c. and A.D. 150 would, however, cover the
total occupation of the lake village sites. It is not necessary to emphasize the fact that there
is evidence of numerous and flourishing Roman occupation in the region of the Somerset
Levels.

(c) Evidence of forest composition

It is apparent that the level of the first flooding horizon corresponds with a greater
disturbance of the tree-pollen curves than is found elsewhere. Alnus shows a big fall,
Quercus a large rise, Tilia ceases about this level and Fagus begins, Ulmus begins a temporary
rise and Betula begins a persistent and considerable increase. These features are those which
characterize the opening of zone VIII of the pollen zone sequence for England and Wales
and which have been ascribed to general climatic control.
