LXXXVIII. A Letter of Mr. James Short,
F. R. S$. to the Royal Society, concerning
the Inventor of the Contrivance in the Pen-
dulum of a Clock, to prevent the Trregula-
rities of its Motion by Heat and Colt

Gentlemen,

Read Nov. 9, HE. ſubject of converſation of late

i bp having often turn'd upon that in-
genious contrivance in the pendulum of a clock, to
prevent the inequalities in its motion, ariſing from its
different lengths, in different ſeaſons of the year, by
the effects of heat and cold ; and it having been often
aſked, who was the inventor of it, I have therefore
"thought proper to draw up the following hiſtorical
account of it : And as this account contains nothing
but matters of faCt, ſupported by the beſt authorities,
I hope it will be acceptable to this Society. Iam

Your moſt obedient humble ſervant,
F. Short, OON after the invention of pendulum-clocks
od (juſtly aſcribed to the celebrated Mr. Huygens),
it was found, that they were liable to conſiderable
inequalities in their motion ; which were imagined
to arife from the pendulum, in its vibrations, de-
ſcribing an are of a circle ; and, conſequently, that
the larger vibrations mult be flower than the ſhorter

ones,
