Limitations of the boundary movement treatment. The most direct evidence for the effect of
stress on boundary movement, and indeed, for the physical occurrence of the boundary
movement process, is derived from experiments on large Barkhausen discontinuities in
specimens (wires) under uniform tension. The quantitative applicability of the basic ideas
to the interpretation of the effect of uniform stress on magnetization curves has been
abundantly confirmed. Uncertainties arise, however, in the extension of these ideas to the
explanation of the low and moderate field behaviour of (unstressed) materials generally in
terms of localized internal stress variations. By postulating a particular type of variation,
a qualitative co-ordination of various magnetic characteristics of a particular material can,
indeed, be obtained; but there is, in general, no independent evidence that the actual internal
stress variations are, in fact, of the type required to account for the magnetic behaviour.
It cannot be too strongly emphasized that the variations required are not of the type corre-

sponding to local fluctuations of density, such as might be associated with variations of
stress having the character of ‘hydrostatic’ pressure, but are variations in spacing such as
would arise from variations in tension along a particular direction.

For well-annealed materials containing small amounts of ‘impurities’ the interpretation
of the magnetic properties in terms of changes in the effective area of domain boundaries,
as suggested by Kersten in his later work, seems very convincing, and the stress variation
