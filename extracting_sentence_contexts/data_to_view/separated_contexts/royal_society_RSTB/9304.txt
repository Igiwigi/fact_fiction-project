Indeed, we have recently
witnessed a variety of actions that reflect that the forensic
community is starting to take on these new challenges
(e.g. the work by the UK Forensic Regulator, the establish-
ment of the US National Commission on Forensic Science
(NCFS) and the Forensic Science Standard Board (FSSB)). Using the human element perspective to dissect forensic
science is not a simple task. In fact, it is a momentous task
and requires a full book (or more), with each chapter dedicated
to a specific topic. This may come in the future, but is definitely
beyond the scope of this paper, which can sketch out only the
main elements of such a project. In addition, it must be kept in
mind that this area, now often called cognitive forensics [2-4], is
relatively new, and therefore contains only relatively few
studies.
