A mixture of triamylamine and iodide of amyl solidifies after two or three days'
ebullition to a solid, somewhat fat-like mass of iodide of tetramylammonium. A
similar effect is produced by boiling an excess of iodide of amyl with a concentrated
80]ution of ammonia. This reaction, however, takes place very slowly ; in fact, the
diminution of affinities characterizing the amyl-compounds in general was in none of
these cases more marked. After two or three days' ebullition the volume of the
ether appeared scarcely diminished ; but then a gradual change occurred, the heavy
amyl-compound rising and floating upon the solution of the new iodide which was
formed. After a fortnight's ebullition the aqueous layer began to solidify, when
allowed to cool; but even after keeping the mixture for a period of three weeks in
ebullition, on opening the boiler-tube the reaction was found to be far from complete.
