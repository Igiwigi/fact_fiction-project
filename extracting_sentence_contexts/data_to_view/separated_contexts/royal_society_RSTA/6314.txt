Furthermore, here the assumption has also been
made that the distribution function of the electrons in the continuum is at all times Maxwellianâ€”
ie. we have both ignored the fact that the cold metal will have a Fermi-Dirac distribution of the
electrons, and we have further assumed that thermalization of the electrons is instantaneous. Both of the aforementioned assumptions warrant scrutiny. If, for the sake of argument, we do
assume instantaneous thermalization, the fact that the current version of the code does not take
into account the Fermi degeneracy of the initial electrons is unlikely to be significant because the
electron temperature exceeds the Fermi temperature on exceedingly short time scales. Figure 9
shows the calculated electron temperature and density as a function of time in the solid-density
case. The electron temperature rise exceeds the Fermi energy of Mg (4.4eV), justifying classical
statistics in less than 0.2 fs.
