THEORIES ON THE POPULATION GENETICS

Of course not all mutations are harmful, and the Important questions to be addressed include (i) pre-
occasional fitness increasing mutations drive adaptive _ diicting the fate of individual mutations such as their
evolution. In this issue Orr (2010) points out how fixation probability Pax and times to loss Tigss or fix-
some intriguing statements can be made about advan- ation Tgx in a population, (ii) how a given flux of
tageous mutations beyond the fact that they are usually | â„¢utations will impact properties of a population
rare and difficult to observe. They include (i) back Such as nucleotide diversity (7a, ms), divergence
mutations that occur if a large enough number of (Ka, Ks), survival or the rate of evolution of quantitat-
slightly deleterious mutations was previously fixed, ive traits, (iii) how the fates of different mutations will

repair some harmful effects at the molecular level from DNA sequence patterns (e.g. recombination
