Tenth pair. â€”The vagus arises from the series of rounded tubercles which are
situated on the floor of the fourth ventricle. GeagxBAUR} compares these tubereles
to the swellings on the surface of the medulla oblongata in Trigla, and explains the
fact that they are situated outside, by supposing that the 8inus rhomboidalis in that
8pecies is too 8mall to receive them, whereas in Hexanthus the presence of a larger
ventricle affords space for them within it. These tubercles contain a few cells of medium size, from which the roots of the
nerve appear to be derived; each tubercle seems to give rise to a separate root, which,
passing out of the medulla, joins the others to form the nerve in a manner formerly
described. Ronox,$ who has gone minutely into the relations of the roots of this nerve, has
come to the following conclusions.
