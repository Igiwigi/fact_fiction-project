Although these factors may not represent perfectly the variations of ionie mobility
and of ionisation with temperature, the formula has been found to give a satisfactory
representation of the experimental facts over a wide range of temperature. It
accurately expresses the varied types of conductivity-temperature curves recorded in
the present paper, and indicates not only the point of inflexion which is observed in
moderately dilute solutions of sodium hydroxide between 50° C. and 100° C., but also
the maximum conductivity and the second point of inflexion shown in our general
conductivity-temperature curve. Even more important is the fact that by means of this formula it is possible, for
the first time as we believe, to analyse the conductivity-temperature curves for
concentrated as well as for dilute solutions, and to estimate separately the effects
produced by the increase of mobility and by the decay of ionisation which accompany
a rise of temperature.
