_ various magnetic phenomena, with the excellent instruments

supplied to the expedition, at this very interesting place;
where a nearer approach was made to one of the magnetic
poles than had ever been known before. But in the absence of any actual observation on the dip of
the needle, this fact of the error of the compasses having
increased from local attraction so greatly beyond the amount
which had been before observed, is worthy of notice, as
affording an indication that the dip had also increased, and
not inconsiderably. The greatest which was observed, was
86* og'; and after this observation, the ships continued to sail
for six days in the direction in which the dip had hitherto
been found to increase. In concluding this paper, it may be permitted to remark,
that it is to the voyages of discovery undertaken during the
reign of his present Majesty, that a knowledge of the extent
and causes of the errors to, which a compass is subject in ships,
is to be principally attribited; as well as the steps that have .
been taken towards the investigation and remedy of the
inconvenience they occasion to practical navigation.
