206 I. MANTON ON EVIDENCE ON SPIRAL STRUCTURE While all emphasis is thus laid on the weakness of this part of the evidence it is
nevertheless true that such facts as there are cannot easily be swept aside, for the
single aceto-carmine specimen at leptotene (text-fig. 6) remains unrefuted. It is un-
fortunate that no comparable figures appear to exist for another plant. Leptotene
measurements have, however, been made on one animal, Dendrocoelum lacteum, by
Gelei (1922).
