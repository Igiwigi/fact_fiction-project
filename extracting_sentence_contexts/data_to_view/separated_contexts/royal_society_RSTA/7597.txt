We may now go back to our Example II and see how the problem of confidence
intervals could be solved.

(f) Example Ia. Turning back to the probability law of x, and x, as defined in (70), it is easy to
see that x, is a specific sufficient statistic with regard to 6,. As a specific sufficient
statistic with regard to one parameter is a particular case of a sufficient system of
statistics, this fact, together with the Proposition IX, could be used in order to con-
= Struct regions similar with regard to 02, which we require to serve us as regions of
=, acceptance.

§ Inorder to see that x, is a specific sufficient statistic with regard to 0, let us calculate
2 its elementary probability law. Integrating (70) with regard to x, between limits
@ zero and 0, — x,, we easily obtain

o

b (a1) = p (#1, %a] 91, 2) (8: —%,) for O<%= ‘}

(83)
p (x:) = 0 for any other value of x. S It is seen that p (x,) depends both on 6, and 6, and therefore we shall denote it by
= p (*,|0,92).
