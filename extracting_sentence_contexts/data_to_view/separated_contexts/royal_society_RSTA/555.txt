The relationship between the vegetation feedback
and model physics or biases in the model’s modern climatology is discussed in §5 before a rapid
discussion (§6).

2. Forcing and feedbacks at the global scale for the LGM

(a) The simplified framework

We use the Taylor et al. [37] simplified approach to quantify the forcing and feedbacks in the SW
domain. It uses the fact that the variation of the planetary albedo (@) can be decomposed so as to
reflect the individual contributions from the surface albedo (ag), the bulk atmospheric absorption
(1) and the atmospheric scattering (y):

Aa = —— Aas + ——Ay + >—Apu +e,

where e represents the nonlinear contribution of the different parameters and is negligible here,
and A represents the difference between two climatic periods. The first two terms of the right-
hand side of this equation are the ones we focus on. Changes in atmospheric absorption are small
for the MH.
