represent the curve of excitability in relation to the strength of the impulzes.

Further, it was noticed in the course of the experiment from which Plate 69, fig. 17, is taken, that
after a while the same strength of stimulation cansed a series of ventricular contractions when the
auricles and sinus were nob heated, and no effect whatever when the nerve was stimulated during
the time of heating ; in other words, when the strength of the impulses was made still weaker by the
heating, the rise of excitability cansed by the vagus stimulation was not sufficient to make those impulses
efficient to canse ventricular contractions.

Also (as is seen in Plate 69, fig. 17, B, C, D) during the conrse of the experiment each series of
ventricular contractions lasted on the whole a shorter and shorter time, and commenced later and later

after the end of the stimulationâ€”a fact which is to be explained by the progressive exhanstion of the
whole heart.


THE FROG, AND ON THE ACTION OF THE VAGUS NERVE. 1017

On the action of the vagus upon the ventricular muscle when that muscle 1s beating with
alternately strong and weak beats.

When the heart is suspended in the manner already described and the ventricle is
beating in due sequence with the auricles, it frequently happens that, although the
auricular contractions are all equal in force, the ventricle is seen to be beating with
alternately weak and strong contractions, as is shown in Plates 67, 69, figs. 7, 19, 21.
