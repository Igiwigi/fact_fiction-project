> (6) Position and cytology of the cells

The giant cell on each side is the most ventral member of the single row of large
cells which make up the posterior wall of the ventral part of the lobus magnocellularis
(figs. 3, 4 and figs. 15, 18, Plate 42). Each cell lies with its long axis nearly vertical
at the postero-median corner of the lobe. It differs from the ordinary cells of the
ganglion in that it lies within the neuropil rather than in the outer cell layer. Correlated

with this position is the fact that the cell is not T-shaped, as are the ordinary neurons,
but bipolar, with the nucleus lying between axon and dendrites. However, the
internal structure of the cell shows that it is built essentially on a T-shaped plan,
