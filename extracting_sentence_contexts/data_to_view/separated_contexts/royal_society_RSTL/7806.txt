lengths of fore and after body suited to enable a ship to be driven economically at a

given speed. It is well known that in water that is shallow, compared with the length of a wave,
waves of a given period are retarded according to a certain law (se A1Ry on Tides and
Waves). Hence the fact, which has often been observed, that a length which is sufficient.
for a given speed in deep water, becomes insufficient in shallow water—the waves of the
first class becoming divergent, and the swell under the after body lagging behind, 80 as
