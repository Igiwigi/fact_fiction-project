H. DARWIN ON THE STABILITY OF THE PEAR-SHAPED

§ 14. The Lost Energy of the System; Solution of the Problem,

If the several contributions to the energy be examined, it will be seen that if 7,
order of harmonies in f*S;, is odd, there is no term with coefficient ¢?/? in Z; thi
follows from the fact that the and p integrals vanish for the odd harmonies. Hen
as far as concerns the odd harmonies, # involves f; only in the form (//)*.
condition that the pear shall be a level surface is that H shall be stationary f
variations of the /’s and of e. It follows that when 7 is odd fj is zero.
