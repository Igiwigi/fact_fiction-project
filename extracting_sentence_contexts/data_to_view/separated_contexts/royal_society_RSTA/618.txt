Because the complex response of SMAs has several facets
(pseudoelasticity, martensite reorientation, one- and two-way shape memory effects and 3
constrained recovery), only a few of the existing models seek to account for all of them at the same : 8
time [6-8]. In addition, there are some aspects that have yet to receive a sufficiently comprehensive ig
modelling treatment. One of these is the fact that, in certain situations, the phase transformations 18
are observed to occur in spatially localized domains [9]. Another of these is the relatively recent :f
discovery that, in some groups of alloys, phase transformations can be induced in specialized :
ways by magnetic fields [10]. In this paper, we describe a generalized modelling framework that is capable of consistently
dealing with both the above aspects, as well as the conventional ones involving thermal and load
activation.
