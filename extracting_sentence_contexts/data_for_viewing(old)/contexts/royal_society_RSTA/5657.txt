In fact, theorem 5 in [55] establishes a stronger result, namely, that

in the sense of distributions, for t > 0 fixed , where dg is the Dirac measure at the origin.
We modify this construction for the torus T?. We let u be any shear flow, without loss of
generality we take a horizontal shear flow:

u(x, y, t) = (u(y, #), 0), (4.3)

with u a 1-periodic function in y. If u is time independent, u is a steady solution of the Euler
equations in T? with constant pressure, while if u solves the one-dimensional heat equation on
