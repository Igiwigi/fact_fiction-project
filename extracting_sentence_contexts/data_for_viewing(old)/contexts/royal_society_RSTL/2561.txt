troduced some pertinent remarks on this kind of influence, referring to it, amongst
other phenomena, the operation of platina in determining the union of oxygen and
hydrogen in D6BeREINER's experiment. Nor indeed does it seem improbable, that, as
heat exercises a repulsive power, not only between the particles of bodies, but like-
wise between masses of them, 80 likewise a species of affinity may exist between
masses of matter even where their particles are not mutually attractive; and that this
may retard the operation of heat upon bodies possessing intrinsically a considerable
degree of volatility, and prevent their entire disengagement all at once from the cavi-
ties of the substance which entangled them.

Be that as it may, it seems certain from the above observations, that ammonia is
one of the original products of yoleanic action in the case of Vesuvius; and it
would be easy to extend the same inference to other volcanos,â€”a fact, I am aware, by
no means new, but still one, the circumstances of which seem to deserve investiga-
tion, especially, as from the readiness with which nascent hydrogen enters into com-
bination with azote, it might be imagined, that the ammonia was somehow or other
generated in the open air, owing to a disengagement of hydrogen from the lava.

I trust, that the having traced it to the vapour directly issuing from the mass effec-
tually dispels such a suspicion, and will serve as an additional argument in support of
an opinion I have long entertained, that atmospheric air and water both find their way
to the seat of volcanic operations, and are alike deprived of their oxygen by certain
principles there existing ; whilst the residuary nitrogen and hydrogen are evolved, in
in 8ome cases separately, in others united, in the form of ammonia.
