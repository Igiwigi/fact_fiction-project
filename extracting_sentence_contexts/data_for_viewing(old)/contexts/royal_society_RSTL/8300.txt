784 PROFESSOR OWEN ON THE FOSSIL MAMMALS OF AUSTRALIA.

The only difference of note is in the more advanced position of the last molar ; and
this is due to the well-known general forward movement of the serviceable teeth when
those anterior to them have been worn down and shed—a movement which reaches its
maximum in the Elephants.

d 2. Macropus Ferraqus, Ow.—A. portion of a right mandibular ramus with the lip
two TO: in place and worn (Plate LXXXI. fig. 4, and Plate LXXXII. figs. 3 & 4)
indicates, both by the size of the teeth and that of the jaw itself, a Kangaroo too much
exceeding in size the largest individuals of Macropus Titan to belong to that species.
A comparison of the above-cited figures with figures 13, 15 in Plate xx17. of the previous
Part* will demonstrate this fact.

The jaw-bone of Macropus Ferraqus is relatively thicker in proportion to the teeth,
and the last molar (Plate LXXXI.. fig. 3, m ») rises more in adyance of the origin of
the coronoid process; but this may relate to the greater age of the individual as shown
by the exposure of the dentine in both lobes (ib. fig. 4) of that tooth, though they are
not worn to quite the same degree as in fig. 2, Plate LXXVI. The base of the notch
(Plate LXXXII. fig. 4, g) remains on the hind part of 92 s, and internal thereto are
indications of two vertical ridges which I have not found in any fossil of Macropus Titan.

d 3. PachysiagonF Otuel, Ow.—In the portion of right mandible with the three
hindmost molars (Plate LXXVI. figs. 7-10), in which the dentine is exposed on the
summits of the lobes of ms and in the usual proportionally greater degree in m » and
