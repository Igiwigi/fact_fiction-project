In part, however, the breakage is undoubtedly due to the
dynamical strains connected with launching ; and although we cannot separate the effects
produced by these two causes, we may yery properly regard the amount of the breakage
as to some extent a measure of the relation between the strength of the structure and

the strains brought upon it. I will pass over the facts respecting the breakage in the
older clases of wood ships, and confine attention to modern wood ships. Speaking of
merchant vessels, Mr. GRANTHAM 8ays*, ** It is the general custom with builders to leave
the gangways of the bulwarks in modern ships unfinished, lest the hull should 80 much
-alter in form by settling in launching that the rails would not again fit their places ;
- and no builder would willingly copper a vessel when new, but rather allow her first to
find her own position in the water, as she would then be less liable to wrinkle the sheets.‚Äù
