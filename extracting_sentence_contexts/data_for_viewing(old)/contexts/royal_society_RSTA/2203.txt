dimensional submanifold and X is tangent to the level set this yields d(i*w) =0. Observe now
that 22 satisfies dB A 42 = w. Using that expression and the second Euler equation, we obtain

dixp =d(ix(dB A p12) = d(x dB A 2 — dB A txp2)
= —d(dB A txp2) = —dB A dix =0.

This equality stands everywhere. Since in the neighbourhood of the regular level set we have
that dB 40, we infer that dixu2=dB Ay for some one-form y. Accordingly, we obtain that
d(i*tx 42) = 0, thus proving that i*£ is also closed.

Now, suppose that N has no boundary component. Then applying theorem 3.1, we deduce that
it is a torus. If N has a boundary, it must lie on 0M and since it is invariant under a non-vanishing
field X, the boundary consists of finitely many periodic orbits. The fact that X is non-vanishing
and tangent to the boundary of the level set implies that the pullback of # to the boundary is
non-vanishing as well. By remark 3.7, the first case of theorem 3.4 can be applied. Hence, N is
an orientable surface with boundary that fibres over S!, thus it is a cylinder. This determines the
topology of the regular level sets of B. The rest of the proof is standard. Indeed, let ¢ be the flow
of the vector field S = (VB/dB(VB)), which satisfies dB(S) = 1. Then we have

* Bout) AB(S)=1, B(do(x)) = B(x).

We deduce that B(¢;(x)) = B(x) + t and hence the open set Mj is a trivial fibration T? x I fora real
interval I in the case that the level sets have no boundary. The same holds when the level sets are
cylinders (due to the fact that in the complement of the set C the level sets of B intersecting the
boundary have a transverse intersection). Since the vector field X commutes with curlX it follows
