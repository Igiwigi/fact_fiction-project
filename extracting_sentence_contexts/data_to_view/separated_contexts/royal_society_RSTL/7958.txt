F'rox the rapid decrease in late years of the amount of Westerly Magnetic Declination
ver the whole area of the United Kingdom and the adjacent seas, the attention of

EM Hydrographic Department of the Admiralty has been constantly directed to this

Snteresting physical fact as one specially affecting coast navigation and the accuracy of

mosdecings derived from the current charts. 8 The duties of Her Majesty's Surveying-vessels engaged on our own shores having

Sithin the last few years included districts embracing nearly the whole extent of coast-
ine, the opportunities thus afforded for a careful determination of the magnetic decli-
DAation at widely spread and favourable localities were, under the direction of Admiral
ICHARDS, C.B., F.R.S., the Hydrographer of the Admiralty, taken advantage of, and
_ instruments furnished to the Commanding Officers from the Admiralty Compass
Department.
