Behind the parachordal in the duck embryos at the stage described, there can be
seen three separate rings of cartilage surrounding the notochord (0.v. 1, 0.v. 2, a.t.).
Comparison with later stages shows that these represent two vertebrae which will
become incorporated in the skull (the Ist and 2nd occipital vertebrae) and the first
vertebra of the neck, or atlas vertebra. We are thus able to confirm the important
observations of Sontes (1907) and JacEr (1924) in this respect.

Another pair of chondrifications which appear very early are the rudiments of the
cochlear portions of the auditory capsules (c.c.). At this stage, they are just recogniz-
able as faint tracts of blue-stained tissue, on each side of, but distinct from, the anterior
end of the parachordal. These are the cartilages which Sontes called mesotic or
basiotic. They clothe the median faces of the cochlear portions of the auditory sac,
and are the first part of the auditory capsules to undergo chondrification. The fact
that they are independent of the parachordal is of theoretical importance, since it
further invalidates Gavupp’s theory (already contradicted for the mammal by
NoorpDENsBos (1905), DE Brrr (1929), and p—E Beer and Woopcer (1930)), that the
cochlear portion of the auditory capsule is a modified derivative of the basal plate
of the skull.
