Only very careful observation shows that by increasing
the illumination NA the resolution limit is in fact increased, despite the apparent loss in contrast. Abbeâ€™s oblique illumination geometry was in this respect very helpful to maintain contrast. In
fact, the same lateral resolution limit (equation (1.2)) also applies to confocal microscopy imaging
scattering samples. An especially interesting case concerns the case NAitiu > NAget, with the
inner part below NA ge of the illumination blocked, referring to dark-field microscopy. A single
grating with a spatial frequency, just below the limit as stated in eqn. 1.2, will at best cause a
homogeneous image.
