In the afternoon of the same day, at Karleh, 2015 feet
above the sea, seven miles east of Kundallah, a cubic foot of air held 2:954 grains,
and on the 12th, at 4 p.., 2'611 grains of aqueous vapour. On the summit of Loghur,
3381 feet above the level of the sea, and 1366 feet above Karleh, the dewing-point
at sunrise the next day was 5* Fans. below the freezing-point, temperature of air 67*;
and a cubic foot of air held only 1:995 grains of water in a state of vapour. These facts fully establish the remarkable discrepancies between the hygrometric
state of the air in Bombay and Dukhun, and that too within a difference of a few
miles of latitude and longitude. A comparison of the absoJute fall of rain in Bombay
and in Poona for the years 1826, 1827, and 1828, sﬆhows an agreement (to a certain
extent) in their ratio to the relative hygrometrie state of the airat Poona and Bombay
above noticed*, The occasional extreme dryness of the air in the months of Decem-
ber, January, February, and part of March, is productive of some inconvenience; new
furniture cracks, planks separate from each other, doors shrink 80 much that the
locks will not catch ; the leaves of card-tables warp, and manifest a disposition to
curl up, and are only kept level by the constant application of brackets ; ink disap-
pears as if by magic, and the nibs of pens, by their recession from each other, mani-
fest a provoking mutual antipathy. I will confine my observations on the fall of rain in Dukhun within a narrow com-
pass, as a glance of the eye over the Tables, Nos. 23—28, will afford every infor-
mation.
