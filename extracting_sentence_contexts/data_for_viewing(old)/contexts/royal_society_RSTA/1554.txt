2. Nonlinear resonance in the context of image processing, visual perception
and dithering

(a) Image processing

As it is generally the case, the concept of image filtering with nonlinear resonances was first
introduced with one-dimensional signals and is mainly based on the SR property: adding an
appropriate amount of noise enhances the response of a system to a coherent information
excitation. However, motivated by the fact that adding this optimal amount of noise in real
system is not an easy task, parameter-induced stochastic resonance (PSR) has then been proposed
as a convenient solution to take benefit of the noise enhanced property in the field of signal
processing [29,30]. Later, the concept was extended to two-dimensional signals in the image
processing field. In fact, the underlying strategy of PSR consists in changing the intrinsic
characteristic of a nonlinear system to induce a cooperative effect between the input excitation
and the noisy nonlinear system. In image processing, these techniques have revealed better results
than a classical low-pass filter to denoise black and white images [31]. In fact, the measure of
performance used in this study was the bit error ratio between the original noiseless image and


the processed image. A weaker error was observed for the PSR method which held more the
image details at large noise intensity than when a simple low-pass filter was used.

Very recently, another way to take benefit of SR in image processing by adjusting the
system parameters has been addressed in a nonlinear optical system containing photorefractive
or nematic liquid crystals [32-35]. During this process of image enhancement, which uses
