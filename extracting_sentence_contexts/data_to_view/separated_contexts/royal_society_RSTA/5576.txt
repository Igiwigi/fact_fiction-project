All
these results concern pure mixing and transport of the scalar field and can be considered in the
limit of infinite Schmidt number. There are significantly fewer works in pde/analysis addressing
mixing with diffusion and, in particular, bounds on the energy dissipation rate or the spectrum for
scalar turbulence at large, but finite, Schmidt number [21-24]. In fact, transport can both enhance
as well as balance diffusion. Historically, the Kraichnan model [25] has played an important role in the study of anomalous
diffusion and anomalous scaling (among the many references, we mention in particular
[26-30], and the monograph [31]). In this model, the passive scalar is advected by a random
flow, generated by a Gaussian-in-space, white-in-time vector field.
