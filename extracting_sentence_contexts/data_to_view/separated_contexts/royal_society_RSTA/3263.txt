1 (ef §5 above). As in the case of
silver, these curves should fairly accurately represent the absorptions produced by
copper spheres in glass v = 1°56, in glass » = 1°5, and by copper spheres or molecules

* The fact that Ry increases from yellow to red, while R diminishes in the same range, would be
accounted for if the black paper with which Sir Witt1aM ABNryY backed the stained face of the glass
reflected 2 per cent. of the light incident on it. Further experiments are to be made on this.
