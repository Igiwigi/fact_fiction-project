We have obtained a rough presentation of the development of an “‘incipient spin” of
moderate but stalled incidence. As time progresses the aeroplane turns downwards, as is
indicated by (23-17); its speed increases, as indicated by (23-16); its spin about the
vertical increases, as shown by (23-16); and the radius of curvature of the horizontal
projection of its path decreases, as shown by (23-18). The applicability of these results is restricted by the fact that 7’ is of zero order, that
P, Q, R must not become large, and that c? cos / sin? ¢
