The ribbed outer edye then goes backwards and a little upwards, and then spreads

| — there is a real additional temporal scale-bone, or supratemporal (s.t.), but in
those other dwarfed types—the Mole and the Shrew—the apparent second temporal
bone was shown to be only a peculiar rambling of the prootic bone into the pterotic
region—a part, in fact, of the chondrocranium, ossified. by a periotic bony centre.

Here, the likeness of this, the smallesb of the Tenrecs to the dwarfed Shrew, is
seen to be largely superficial ; they are very wide apart, zoologically.*

The slender hamnlar process of the pterygoid (g.) can be seen passing backwards
from the thick palatine wall, and the annulus (a.ty.) also comes imperfectly into view
in this aspect. The mandible (d.) is long, gently arched downwards, sinuous above,
through the swelling caused by the teeth roots, and gently convex below. 'The
coronoid process (c.p.) is a blunt, high triangle ; the condyloid (cd.p.) is neat and
rounded ; the angular process (figs. 3, 4, ag.p.) is slender (almosb Soricine) and
somewhat incurved, below.
