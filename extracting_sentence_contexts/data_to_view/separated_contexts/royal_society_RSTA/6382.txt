We developed procedures for measuring
photosynthesis and respiration of a column of forest (including all species that were there)
using a LI-COR CO) analysis machine and a giant slingshot and rock climbing technology
to reach upper portions of the forests.... We found a clear tradeoff between rate and
efficiency and a maximum net photosynthesis (useful power) at an intermediate elevation. We wonder whether the environmental conditions at 800 m elevation in the Luquillo Forest
represent something of ideal conditions for the balance of photosynthesis and respiration
for trees more generally as forest net production also may show a maximum at intermediate
latitudes [31,32].â€™ [6]

The fact that their findings were consistent with their hypothesis provides evidence that the MPP
guides the evolution of forests. Table 1.

Leopold and Langbein provide empirical evidence that tests the MPP in the physical world
[33]. They show that streams in tributary networks would disperse their potential energies more
quickly if they took more direct routes; instead, what we find in the designs that emerge is that
streams in these networks take less direct routes, they meander, and in the process they collect and
dissipate more available energy.
