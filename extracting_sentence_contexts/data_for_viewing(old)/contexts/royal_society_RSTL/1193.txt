containing the aqueous humour always of the same size, and to
keep the. cornea and lens at the same distance from each other.
The ciliary processes, as they form a complete septum between
the vitreous and aqueous humours, must be moved forward,
together with the lens, when the cornea is rendered more con-
vex, and when the cornea recovers itself they are thrown back
into their former situation. In order to effect this with the
nicety that is required, the ciliary processes are probably pos-
sessed of a muscular power.

That the ciliary processes are muscular is a very generally
received opinion, and in the course of this lecture I shall ad-
duce some facts in favour of it; they will also tend to confirm
the opinion of these processes being a sling, in which the lens
is suspended, and rendered capable of a small degree of motion.

The result of this inquiry, which has not been confined to
the support of any particular theory, but carried on with the
sole view of discovering the truth, appears to be, that the ad-
Jjustment of the eye is produced by three different changes in
that organ; an increase of curvature in the cornea, an elonga-
tion of the axis of vision, and a motion of the crystalline lens.
These changes in aÂ»great measure depend upon the contrac-
tion' of the four straight muscles of the eye.
