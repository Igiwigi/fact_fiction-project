The LPT limit cycle emerges for some low values of nonlinear and dissipation parameters
of the system. It encircles one of the stationary points (unstable simple periodic regime of the
full system (3.30)) at (7/4, 32/2). In fact, for the lower values of dissipation and nonlinearity
(figure 9a(i-iii)), the stable LPT limit cycle corresponds to the intense (nearly complete) energy
exchange between the axial and the lateral vibrations of the outer element of the full model (3.30). When the parameters of dissipation d and/or nonlinearity k are gradually increased, the form of
the LPT limit cycle on the phase plane is being deformed, while it still remains the only stable
attractor of the system. At some point the two pairs of stationary points appear within the LPT
point.
