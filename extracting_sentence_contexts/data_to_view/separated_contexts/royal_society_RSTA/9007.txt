G. BARKLA ON X-RAYS AND THE THEORY OF RADIATION.

absorption does not differ greatly from that for the L electrons, we may class them all
as L electrons. As all electrons leave the atom with the same velocity, and as the
emission of the fluorescent radiation is subsequent to the absorption of primary
radiation, we may express the fact in the following way :—The energy of a quantum
of K radiation is the energy required to move an electron from the position and
state of a K electron to the position and state of a lower frequency electron,
an Lelectron. (We are led to regard a K electron as being situated nearer to the
centre of the atom than the lower frequency electrons, and, in general, the frequency
of vibration of electrons to be in the order of their distance from the surface. Thus
the J, K, L, M electrons are arranged in this order from the centre outwards.)

But when a K electron is hurled out of the atom, it is possible that, for
stability, another electron will fall into the position and state of the K electron. If it falls from the position and state of an L electron, the energy of a quantum
of K radiation must be re-emitted.
