These differences, which are taken from the ‘ Indian Meteorological Memoirs,’ vol. 1,
page 826, would produce N.W. winds, indicated by the positive sign, from about
9h. 21m. to17h. 7m, and again from 22h, 42 m. to 2 h. 12 m., the remaining hours
having gradients for 8.E. winds, indicated by the negative sign. Now, from the paper
last referred to, we learn that, in the hot season, the resultant wind at Allahabad blows
at all hours from points between S.73°W. and N.5°W., the double oscillation
suggested by the Table being combined with and masked by a prevalent N.W.
direction, though it is plainly indicated in the diagram formed by joining the ends of
the lines representing the resultants for the several hours. The differences in the
Table, in fact, are so small, not exceeding ‘0275-inch in about 813 geographical miles,
or *002-inch per degree of the earth’s surface, that near the ground, where the friction
coefficient is large, the winds due to them would be so light as to be almost imper-
ceptible ; and, accordingly, we find that the double gyration of the wind vane, which
would be produced by this cause, is almost entirely hidden by the influence of the
more powerful currents of the higher atmosphere which descend in the middle of the
day. The N.W. winds due to the diurnal inequality of pressure are, however,
probably more than twice as strong in the afternoons as in the early mornings, the
maximum pressure differences being in the ratio of 275 to 112, so that this cause
combines with convective interchange between the lower and higher strata to make
the velocity greatest about the hottest time of the day.
