than a half-century and has matured as a mathematical theory in the past
20 years. Yet surprisingly for a theory so central to an entire field, some of
its connections to evolutionary theory more broadly remain contentious or

http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2015.0085 between inclusive fitness and modern evolutionary theory through the
following fact: inclusive fitness is simply classical Darwinian fitness, aver-
aged over social, environmental and demographic states that members of
a gene lineage experience. Therefore, inclusive fitness is neither a generaliz-
ation of classical fitness, nor does it belong exclusively to the individual. There is no fitness but fitness, and the lineage
is its bearer.
