If the interpretation is correct the palatoquadrate must be pretty firmly
articulated to the neurocranium, attached anteriorly by an ethmoid articulation and
medially by the posterior end of the ‘hemidome’, and since it receives no support from
the hyomandibular the type of jaw suspension would be auto-stylic. The ‘hemidome
septum’ still requires explanation, and it seems possible that it is a palatal tooth-bearing
process. It is very difficult to offer a convincing explanation of the ‘anterior trapezial
bar’ and the pregammation, but since neither structure appears to be closely con-
nected to the neurocranium nor to the palatoquadrate it seems possible that they may
represent more anterior ossifications of Meckel’s cartilage, or possibly tooth plates
or again ossifications bearing teeth, a view which is supported by the fact that the
palatoquadrate in all specimens is found overlapping the ‘hemidome septum’. Since
the palatoquadrate is so closely connected to the neurocranium it seems probable
that some kind of crushing dentition must have been present. If this interpretation
is correct, the opening of the mouth would lie a short distance behind the ‘ampyx’,
