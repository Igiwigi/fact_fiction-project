In Cambridge, being aware of this work, Volker Heine and I were then inspired by a talk given
by Marcel Vallade [6] of the University of Grenoble concerning the flexibility of quartz in its high-
temperature 8 phase. In f-quartz, there is a phonon mode that softens on cooling towards the
a-B phase transition. For the phase transition, this mode will soften at wave vector q = 0, but in
fact, there is a softening of the whole branch from q =0 to q=a*/2. For phonon wave vectors
q— 0, there is an interaction between the soft optic mode and a transverse acoustic mode that
varies as q”; the soft optic mode and transverse acoustic mode have same symmetry for q #0
but different symmetries at q=0, and thus the coupling must vanish as q — 0 [7]. This gives
rise to the previously unexpected incommensurate phase transitions over a short temperature
interval between the a and £ phases.
