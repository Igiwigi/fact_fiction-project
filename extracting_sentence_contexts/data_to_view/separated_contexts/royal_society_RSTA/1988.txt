So, was Ruskin simply blaming air pollution on the devil? Ruskin’s biographer notes the fact that
[24]

From 1869 through 1889 the temperature in London was below average for 18 of the 21
years; rainfall was abnormally heavy from 1875 through 1882; reliable figures for sunshine
are available only after 1879, but 16 of the 20 autumns and winters from 1880 through 1889
were below average, and the total sunshine was below average for more than 60 per cent of
the decade;

We should note here that it was Stokes who improved the sunshine gauge now known as the
Campbell-Stokes recorder or Stokes sphere [25-27]. Ruskin’s comment [10] on that instrument is

you have your sun-measure, and can tell exactly at any moment how strong, or how weak,
or how wanting, the sun is. But the sun-measurer can not tell you whether the rays are
stopped by a dense shallow cloud, or a thin deep one.
