The peak of viral replication is usually controlled by the innate response together with target
cell limitation and further clearance of the virus is controlled by CD8 T-cells and antibodies [27â€”
29]. In this simplified model, we do not represent the innate response, and we consider notional
antibodies as generalized effectors providing the only mechanism for clearance of viral particles.
We begin with the activation of B-cells in an infected individual bound to a virus population,

. (a pdr) (3.2)

On the left-hand side, the individual has no activated B-cells, and on the right-hand side, they
acquire a population of activated B-cells. The subscript on B indicates that all B-cells in this
population are naive: they have very low affinity for viral proteins. This process is interpreted as
allocation of a population of B-cells and not production of the cells themselves. This is somewhat of
a computational fiction and is an artefact of the simplifying choice as with the virus population to
not track individual cells, but only their count (or in this case, their affinity). The process therefore
proceeds immediately, at infinite rate.

The function of B-cells is to produce antibodies. Again, as with the virus population, we do
not track individual antibody proteins, we simply track their number, again logarithmically. The
second process in the activation of immune response is,

As with the activation of B-cells, this process is interpreted as allocation of a population of
antibodies, not the production of antibodies themselves. Antibody production is a separate rule
(equation (3.5)). As with the allocation of a B-cell population, the allocation of an antibody
