group members) can become a quite challenging enterprise. In fact, it is pre-
cisely this fluid state of affairs that constitutes one of the main reasons why
social life is thought to be particularly complex, and why some authors
placed a particular emphasis on social as opposed to non-social aspects to
explain the evolution of cognition (e.g. [4,5]).

Further elaboration of this idea led Whiten & Byrne [6] to focus on the tac-
