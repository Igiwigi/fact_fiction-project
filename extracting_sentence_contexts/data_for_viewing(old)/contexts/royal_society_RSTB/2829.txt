Differences of size of the leaf exist within near circles of affinity ; in the genus
Lycopodium such differences between species are very marked ; in the Psilotacese there
is a palpable advance by branching from the general Lycopodinous plan. Among the
fossils, Avchewocalamites shows a branched Calamitian leaf, and some Sphenophylls
show more branched leaves than others. Instances might be indefinitely extended
among the Ophioglossacese and Ferns to show that leaf-complexity and size are very
variable within near limits of relationship. These suggest that the megaphyllous
character was probably derived from some simpler source, being an extreme and
permanent condition of such variability as we see exemplified in the various phyla.

Similarly with the phyllosiphonic arrangement of the vascular tissue, it is open to
any one to hold that this is nothing more than the internal structural expression of
the accomplished fact of a larger leaf-development, and confirmed as a constant in
those plants where large leaf-development is the type. A race originating from a
small-leaved stock, and becoming large-leaved, would in the process undergo conversion
from the one anatomical type to the other. Something of this nature is actually the
case in the young Leptosporangiate Fern, where the stem is protostelic at first, and
only becomes phylosiphonic at a later stage.*

If such changes did take place during descent, the distinction of Dr, Jerrrey
would not rank as defining phylogenetically distinct races, but rather as a register of
such leaf development in the mature plants as differentiated them from some common
source. This is the view of the facts which I adopt, and consequently the Pteropsida
and Lycopsida are, in my view, not to be regarded as without any phylogenetic
relation, but two phases of development of a strobiloid type, separated at a very early
