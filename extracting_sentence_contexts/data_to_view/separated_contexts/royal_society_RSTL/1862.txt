4. On the Power possessed by Mollusca of dissolving Shells, Rocks, Sec.

It has been generally believed, and indeed sometimes most positively as-
serted, that Molluscous animals do not possess the power of reabsorbing the
matter of their shells when once deposited. 'The following observations, I think,
will distinetly prove that this theory is quite unsupported by fact. If a Cone, an Olive, or any shell whose last whorl almost completely enve-
lopes and protects the rest, and whose cavity is much compressed, allowing
only a small space for the conyolutions of the body of the animal, be slit down,
either from the apex to the front of the axis, or across the body yolution, at a
little distance before the suture, it will be observed that all the septa between
the different whorls are extremely thin and transparent ; and when these septa

: ginally composed, which plate will
be seen to agree in 8tructure with the inner one of the three. On tracing these
8epta to the outer whorl, it will be observed that every part of them, during the
various stages of growth of the shell, has been once a part of the outer whort;
and since we know from experience that the outer whorls of the young Olive
and young Cone are as thick in proportion to their 8ize as those of the adult,
there is little reason to doubt that each of these septa was originally formed
of three plates, in the same manner as the other parts of the shell.
