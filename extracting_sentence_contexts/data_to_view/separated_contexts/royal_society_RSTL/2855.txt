the Channel (which is only about fifty miles) would be fourteen feet. Such an
average elevation of one side of a narrow sea above the other is quite inconsistent
with the laws of fluids. I cannot conclude this paper without again pointing out that a great number of
curious facts in fluid motion are established by these Tide Researches, of which it
may be hoped the theory of hydrodynamics will one day be able to render a reason. Why is it that at places near each other the range of the oscillations of the sea from
low to high water is 80 different ? Why is it that the sun affects the low water at Ply-
mouth more than the high water, and that the moon's declination at Singapore affects
the low water four times as much as the high water, while at Plymouth it affects it
less?
