* There is a difficulty in using the method for determining the vapour pressure of the atmosphere
owing to the fact that the readings must be taken in a chamber quite free from draught. We find, on
shutting up a chamber, the vapour pressure at once begins to rise owing to water absorbed on the walls of
the chamber being given off as vapour and increasing the saturation of the stagnant air. The drying
power of moving air is thus exemplified.
