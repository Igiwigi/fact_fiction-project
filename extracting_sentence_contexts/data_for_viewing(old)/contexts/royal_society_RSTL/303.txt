ceive confirmation from their concurrence. Number (29)
may be noticed as a result anticipated from preceding data,
and found to coincide with remarkable accuracy,

In the distillation of nitric acid from nitre,'the whole of the
acid may be obtained, if we employ enough of sulphuric acid
to convert the residuum into bi-sulphate of potash. In this
case each portion of potash, from which dry nitric acid is
separated, will displace the water from two equivalent quan-
tities of sulphuric acid, and each portion of nitric acid weigh-
ing 67,54 will be found combined with 22,64,of water. Hence
90,18 of liquid nitric acid 80 obtained -should dissolve -the
equiyalent 6g of carbonate of lime. And in fact, by an expe-
riment carefully conducted on a large scale by Mr, PuLLies,*
it appears that 6814 of such acid did dissolve 476 of marble,
which is in the proportion of 9go,18 to 62,96, corresponding
with the estimate within 4575 part, a degree of coincidence
rarely to be found even in the repetition of the same experi-
ment by the most skilful analyst.

The specific gravity of this acid was found to be 1,50.
