representations are those of the artist rooted on Earth. An interesting speculation would concern
the form of such work if the artists were elsewhere; and in one case this is a splendid example of
how different the view might be without travelling too far from ‘home’.

In 1887, the pioneering Russian scientist Konstantin Tsilkovsky wrote On the Moon. This
science fiction speculates about scientists who travel to the Moon and experience low gravity,
but in the course of their adventure also witness a solar eclipse like no other: the Earth eclipsing
the Sun. This conceit is brought to life (in the eventual publication) through a splendid illustration
by Gotman (figure 35).

9. Concluding thoughts

As is so often the case, the best science fiction can foreshadow scientific reality. While Tsilkovsky
proposed one fresh view of eclipses, a splendid new exhibition at the Natural History Museum
(Otherworlds) also shows how a different viewpoint can have a dramatic impact.

The exhibition explores the beauty of the solar system and draws upon composite
photographic images created by Michael Benson.’ These are derived from raw data provided
by the National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) and European Space Agency
(ESA). Some images remind us that a solar eclipse is momentous not just in our accustomed view
of the Moon blocking out the life-giving Sun. Seen from elsewhere in the system, we are reminded
(as the Moon makes its transit) of the utter and momentous vastness of the Sun. Suddenly, the
long-held notion that it has been ‘eclipsed’ becomes absurd.

6On the Moon was first published in 1893 in the Vokrug Sveta (Around the World) magazine and then in the same year as
