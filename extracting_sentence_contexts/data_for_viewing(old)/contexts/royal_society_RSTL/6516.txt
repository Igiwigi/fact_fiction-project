the nuclei were 79 exactly alike around the whole circumference of the canal. In the
anterior third of the layer they were in eyery respect similar to those which I have just
described ; and at the front of the canal, the fibres proceeding from their peripheral ends
were een to cross the commissure, and become directly continuous with the process of
pia mater within the anterior fissure. Frequently this process consisted almost entirely
of blood-yessels containing numerous well-preserved globules, and at the bottom of the

* This statement is confirmatory of the descriptions which I first gave of the ramifications of the pro-
cexxes of the nerye-cells of the spinal cord, â€”Philosophical Transactions, 1851, p- 614.

+ On a former occasion (Phil, Trans. 1859, Part I. p, 455, and Plate XXII. fig. 55) I showed that the
canal in the human cord is sometimes double, or rather that two secondary canals, as it were, are hollowed
through the mass of epithelium just mentioned. The zame fact has since been made the subject of a paper
by Dr. Jon. Waxes, in Rerouerr-DuBoIs's Archiv fiir Anat. &c. 1861, P- 735. Even in the fourth ven-
triele, at the calamug criptorius, in Man I have frequently found on the surface a kind of short snpple-
mentary canal formed by a double layer of epithelium enclosing a narrow spaces

fixzure it gave off a brush-like radiation of fibres that were continuous with those of the
epithelium. In other sections, blood-vessels from the same process extended right and
left, as well as backward and around the canal. Some of the fibres from the epithelial
cells on each side of the front layer, after crossing the anterior commissure; penetrated
the anterior white columns, at the sides of the fissure, and were lost in the tissne between
