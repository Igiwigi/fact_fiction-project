form of apparatus can be readily taken to pieces and cleaned, which was often
necessary, since a number of liquids were used.

To obtain a given expansion, the piston A was adjusted in position until the initial
pressure was the necessary one for that expansion.

The pressure in the 25-litre globe G, with which the tube F communicates, was


448 MR. T. H. LABY ON THE SUPERSATURATION AND

kept below 80 mm. of mercury. With this pressure the piston falls rapidly—so
rapidly, in fact, that a number of pistons were broken.
The amount of the expansion in any experiment is measured by

v, _ the initial gas pressure _ B—7—s,
v, the final gas pressure B—a—s,

:

where B is the barometric pressure, 7 the saturated vapour pressure of the liquid at
the temperature of the experiment (7.e., initially), and s, the initial and s, the final
reading of the gauge P.
