The measurements considered in this paper are: L the greatest length, B the
greatest breadth of the skull, H the height measured from the auricular line, I the
= cephalic index = B/L, and C the capacity. In choosing the material several points
2 had to be borne in mind :
§ (i.) A sufficiently large series must be used.
& Asa matter of fact, 50 to 100 skulls are considered by craniologists to be a fair
© series, but such numbers are small from the mathematician’s standpoint. ‘© (ii.) Material must be drawn from as widely different races as possible, if we are to
“= measure the legitimacy of applying results obtained from one local race to another,
