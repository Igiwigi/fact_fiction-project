Typically, such a paper has 30-50 pages and
runs as follows. After an introduction, the statement of results, and some general remarks, four
or five cases are analysed in some detail. After that, the proof is concluded by an observation
that the analysis of the remaining 437 cases—or was it in fact 653?—is similar, but easier. What
struck me most, though, was that, even for the few cases that were considered, their analysis
referred to pictures in a highly non-trivial way. It is not that I, as someone coming from a different
background, do not understand these proofs.
