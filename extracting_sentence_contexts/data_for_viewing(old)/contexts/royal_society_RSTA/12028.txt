=1(2— Va cos 26 [(1 — d cos?) — (1 — A sin? 4)-*?] dg.

a Since 0 < ¢ < 41, every element of the integral is positive.
a Hence F” (A) is positive ; and, therefore, as \ increases from 0 to 1, F (A) increases

from ato.

2 Hence as d* diminishes from j4a* to 0, the time of revolution increases from
HAan/3Z to o.

= The fact, that when d*= 0, the time is infinitely great, may be verified by finding
Sthe time along the axis of the vortex sphere from end to end, and the time along a
=neridian from one end of the axis to the other.
