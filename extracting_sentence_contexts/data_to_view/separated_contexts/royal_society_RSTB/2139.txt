Similar experiment ; coil at 40 units. The numerical measurements of these two records are given in

the text. In any case, however, and quite apart from any comparison with signs of expen-
diture in other tissue, the bare fact as regards the retina considered alone preserves
all its interest, viz., that tetanisation like light provokes positive response, and that
the two kinds of response wear out in a parallel manner, I should add that the
parallelism is not always absolute, that sometimes I have found large response to
light with small response to tetanisation, and at other times a reversed relation. These exceptions do not, however, disturb the evidential value of instances in which
parallelism has been clear. They have probably had their origin in polarisation, which
had more or less added to or subtracted from the physiological response.
