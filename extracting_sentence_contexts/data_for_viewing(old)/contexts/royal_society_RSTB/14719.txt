with receptive fields that represent less than 1Â° within the
fovea [8]. In comparison, auditory spatial tuning is broad,
within both the primary auditory cortex and PT [9,10], and
neural tuning to sound-source locations seem to be rep-
resented by an opponent process, based on differences in the
activity of two broadly tuned channels formed by contra-
and ipsilaterally preferring neurons [9,11,12].

By contrast to the robust retinotopic organization observed
in all early visual areas [13,14], no map exists for auditory
location (or for proxy cues, such as interaural level or phase
differences) in mammalian auditory cortex [15]. The reason
for this is not clear, but it may be related to the fact that that reti-
notopic location and auditory frequency are directly encoded
within the retina and the cochlea. Early visual area maps do
not represent spatial position [16], which must be computed
by combining retinal signals, head position and eye position.
Similarly, early visual area maps do not reflect depth, which
is inferred using a combination of cues such as stereopsis and
motion parallax. Like spatial location, and depth, sound
location must be inferred through a combination of cues, includ-
ing interaural level differences, interaural time differences,
pinna shadows and Doppler shift. Although these cues support
extremely high temporal sensitivity (e.g. gap detection on the
order of 1.5-3 ms [17]), spatial resolution is poor [1].
