between the behaviour of the seyered margin and of the mutilated nectocalyx with
reference to these two kinds of stimulation ; for while the former shows itself more
sensitive to the induced shock than to the direct current, the reyerse is true of the
latter. That is to say, while the s8evered margin continues responsive even to weak
induction-shocks after it has ceased to be affected either by make or break of the direct
current, the mutilated nectocalyx continues responsive to make and break of the direct
current after it has ceased to respond to the strongest induced shock, or eyen to

cases). It is needless to observe how strongly this fact points to the ganglionic nature
of the locomotor centres in the marginal tissnes of Meduse.

My observations were principally made upon the genus Sarsia; and the method 1
employed was to pass the platinum electrodes into the concavity of the mutilated
swimming-bell while the latter was in the water, and then gently to raise the former
until the contact between them and the tisxue was seen to be sufficiently intimate.
Similarly of course with the severed margin. I may here remark, for the benefit of
those who may repeat this observation, that when the constant current is being applied
to the mutilated bell the latter often contracts in a somewhat rhythmical manner.
This is perhaps due to the hydrogen bubbles acting as stimulants to contraction,
and in any case is certainly not to be regarded as spontaneous action. I may also
state that minute crustaceans, by striking the mutilated bell, sometimes supply a
