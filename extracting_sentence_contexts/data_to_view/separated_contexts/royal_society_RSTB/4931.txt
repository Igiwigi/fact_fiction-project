Resin canals are present in the outer margin of the primary wood of the root.” In the
above quotations it would seem that the term “ cortex ” is used in the way that Dr Baryt
defined it, as including both the “ bast zone, bast or liber (phloem) which, limited internally
by the cambium, includes and is characterized by all the phloem-groups of the ring,
and the external corter, DUHAMEL’s enveloppe cellulaire, lying outside this.” At any
rate, this is the ordinary interpretation of the above statements, and is the logical one,
from the fact that otherwise reference to the well-known resin canals in the outer and
primary cortex of the stem is omitted from what would seem to be a general statement
regarding the resin canals. Not only are the quotations not explicit with regard to the
cortex, but they involve fundamental misconceptions, as our study of the conditions
in Picea, by series of sections, has revealed. The resin canals of the bast and primary cortex of the stem will be considered first.
