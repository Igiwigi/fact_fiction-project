In the case of the Fungus causing the tubercles
on the roots of Leguminosze it is not difficult to suggest that it might obviously be a
disadvantage to the parasite to develope resting-spores, of (comparatively) large size,
which should be set free on the rotting of the root, since they would not easily be
disseminated in the soil; on the other hand, it would seem to be a great step gained
if the habit of forming yeast-like gemmules no larger than Bacteria was thrown back,
as it were, earlier into the life-history. There is no lack of equally curious adaptations
in the life-history of Fungi. In fact, steps towards such retrogression are already
found in the asexual development of the resting-spores of the Ustilagines if we accept
DE Bary’s views as to their homologies ; and it does not seem possible to refute them. These extremely minute gemmules will be disseminated between the interstices of
the soil as easily as the well-known Schizomycetes found everywhere ; every stream,
every puff of wind, and many slighter movements will carry them from place to place,
and hence their ubiquity. I have been much exercised with the question as to whether these gemmules bud
and multiply in the soil, “e., in artificial nutritive solutions, and have repeatedly
made efforts to cultivate them in hanging drops of pure water, PAsTrur’s solution, and
other nutritive media.
