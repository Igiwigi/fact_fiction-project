M. 8S. WATSON ON THE STRUCTURE,

that the Rachitomi and Stereospondyli are really genetically related. The similar
resemblances to the Embolomeri depend on the fact that the Recieee are derived
from that group. It follows that by comparing a Stereospondyl with a Rachitomous type we shall
obtain an idea of the evolutionary trend proper to the groups. TreND oF EvoLuTIoNARY CHANGES IN THE RACHITOMI AND STEREOSPONDYLI.
