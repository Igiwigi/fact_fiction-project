wave-group amplitudes and lengths we identify the pair with length L*, corresponding to the ied

largest amplification.
We formulate the precursor for extreme waves by utilizing the projection of the wavefield to
this wave-group with critical length scale, L*:

x—-—xXx

Yo(x*, t) =2L* (sech ( Ee -) U(x, o) , (3.6)

where the factor 2L* is a normalization constant. In figure 6c, we present the conditional PDF of
the maximum wave elevation in a future time instant within a prediction window extending from
t; =50 to ty = 350, given the magnitude of the precursor |Yo| at the current time instant. The fact
that the high-likelihood unstable mode is localized in space also allows for the determination
of the neighbourhood, x*, where the extreme event will occur in the near future. Note that
compared with the OTD method the precursors based on the highest-likelihood unstable mode
provides with longer warning times. This is because OTD modes need a small amount of time to
align to the currently most unstable modes. The modes presented have been used for predicting
extreme events in nonlinear water waves with high success rates and low false-positive rates [41].
Moreover, in [42] a similar analysis was employed for two-dimensional directional waves.
