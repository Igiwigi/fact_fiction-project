As already mentioned (p. 435), the layer of cells in Gammarus described by
BrrGu as endodermal corresponds in position and appearance to the head mesoderm of
other forms. In the only Decapods in which the origin of the mesoderm has been care-
fully determined (the Paleemoninge, Sontaup), the head mesoderm arises from the “* lames
mesectoblastiques ” and “Tlaire embryonnaire” after the definitive blastopore has
disappeared. The areas of head mesoderm formation correspond with those of Hemimysis,
although mesoderm from the “lames mesectoblastiques ” lies outside the ectodermal
teloblasts, a fact probably correlated with the late appearance of the latter after the
V-shaped germinal band has been formed (text-fig. 29). Thus there is no reason to
suppose that the origin of the head mesoderm bands in other Peracarida and Decapoda
differs materially from that of Hemimysis. Preantennulary segmental mesoderm has not been, described in any other Crustacean.
