Apparatus and Materials —The apparatus,* by
means of which the method theoretically described
in the previous pages was applied to the measure- |
ment of the principal susceptibilities of crystals at
low temperatures, will now be described. As it was
necessary to shut off from the air the space in
which the crystal was suspended and which also
contained the liquefied gas and its vapour, a
fairly complicated cryogenic apparatus had to be
employed. This is shown in section in fig. 8.
It consists principally of three tubular portions Fig. 8.

* The apparatus is, in fact, the one referred to “ depending on the use of couples b, apparatus for crystals
(to be constructed) ” in‘ Leiden Comm.,’ No. 139A, p. 6, in which the programme of the laboratory as regards
magnetic researches is outlined.

which, naming from the outside inwards, we may call the cover, the adjusting tube f
and the holder b. The cover consists of a silvered vacuum tube a, a brass tube B, a
glass tube C, and a cap D, which closes the apparatus.
