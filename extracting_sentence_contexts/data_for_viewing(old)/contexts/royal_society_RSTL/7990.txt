(6) 1s it true that a fully hydrated alt, chemically clean, is not @ nucleus to its $uper-
saturated s0lution?â€”In my firs paper on Supersaturated Saline Solutions" it was
shown that a crystal is not necessarily a nucleus to a saturated saline solution of its own
kind. For example, a supersaturated solution of GLAUBER'S salt, by long keeping, parts
with a portion of its water by evaporation through the cotton-wool plug, ard crystals
are formed on the glass aboye the solution ; on washing these down they do not act as
nuclei: $0 also a cold supersaturated solution of magnesic sulphate # vacuo over 8ul-
phuric acid forms, also by evaporation, crystalline crusts on the surface, and these crusts
are not nuclear. Cases of other salts have been urged where such a crystal becomes a
nucleus, and the old fact has been restated that a salt of a lower degree of hydration is
not a nucleus to a supersaturated solution of a salt of a higher degree of hydration.
What is wanted is to show that the sodic sulphate and the magnesic sulphate, formed
as above described, are not the normal salts, but salts of a lower degree of hydration ;
and this has not yet been done.
