Zero-point-corrected BDEs (kcal mol~') obtained for the diamond proxy models B-D shown in figure 2, at the
B3LYP/6-311G(d) and B3LYP-D3/6-311G(d) levels of theory. (Geometry optimization and zero-point energy corrections were
calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory.)

model C 71 90.5 82.4 11
model D Bé 90.8 813 1.8

show that the smaller model B leads to an overestimate of the C-CH3 and -CH2-H BDEs at the
diamond [100] surface, due to the lack of steric hindrance at the surface. In this respect, models C
and D should be closer to the energies that we would expect at the surface of the diamond slab. The data in table 2 suggest that this is in fact the case, as the calculated bond energies appear
to be converging to a limit as the system size increases. Note that the B3LYP bond energies are
smaller than the B3LYP-D3 energies (especially for BDE(C-C)), owing to neglect of the attractive
dispersive interactions between the methyl radical and the surface. A similar effect can also be
seen for the C-C bond energy of neopentane in table 1.
