eighth experiments related in the paper above alluded to, in
which the carotid and femoral arteries were found beating
and performing the circulation after the |spinal- marrow had
been wholly destroyed.

The labours of M, LE GaLLots, by ascertaining some facts
of great importance, while others immediately connected
with them escaped his observation, have involved the subject
in such seeming contradictions as, at first view, to have per-
Suaded me that some of his experiments were inaccurate. On
repeating many of them, however, I was convinced of their
accuracy. In some the destruction of the cervical part of the

the, same, or a larger portion of the spinal marrow, little
