368 MR, R. T. GLAZEBROOK ON PLANE WAVES IN A BIAXAL CRYSTAL,

It will be noticed that the differences for this modified theory are much less than
for the original, but they have nearly all changed 8ign. In fact, the correction applied,
caleulated 80 as to produce the closest poasible agreement in line 5, has been too great,
and the differences can be reduced by applying a similar but smaller correction in the
opposite direction.

Now this variation in the yalue of py has been caused almost entirely by the
increase of the angle L P; we must therefore decrease this angle again, and as the
numbers in the difference column are each about one-fifth of the corresponding number
in the column B, we must decrease L P by one-fifth of the amount by which it was
previously increased.

But this increase was
