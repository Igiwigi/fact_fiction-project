Remarkably, MosOpn3 formed
photopigments by binding the 13-cis form as well as the 11-cis
form of A1 retinal. Since 13-cis retinal is thermally generated
from all-trans retinal, a retinal isomer present in every tissue,
the 13-cis retinal-binding property allows for the photopigment
formation of MosOpn3 in ‘non-photoreceptive’ tissues [21]. In fact, we have shown by RT-PCR that MosOpn3 is expressed
in the body, suggesting the presence of MosOpn3 in extraocular
tissues. The analysis also demonstrated that MosOpn3 is
expressed in the head. Here, we investigated in detail the
expression of MosOpn3 in the eyes of the mosquito A. stephensi
to reveal that MosOpn3 is expressed specifically in a single kind
of photoreceptor R7 of the dorsal and ventral ommatidia, where
Asop9, which forms a blue-sensitive Gq-coupled visual pig-
ment, is also expressed.
