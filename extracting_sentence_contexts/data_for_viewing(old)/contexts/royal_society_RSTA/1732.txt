(a) If 2 is bounded, then there exist M, 6 > 0 such that To. on L3°(Q) satisfies
IToo(Bflloo <Me"'Iflloo, > 0.
(b) Let 2 be an exterior domain and n > 3. Then Too extends to a bounded analytic semigroup on

L&°(Q) of angle 1/2.

The above assertions are due to Abe & Giga [17], Maremonti [55], Hieber & Maremonti [56] and
Bolkart & Hieber [22]. Let us remark that the above assertion b) can be regarded as an extension
of a classical result due to Borchers & Sohr [42] for 1 < p < o to the case p = 00.

The approach developed in [22] even gives pointwise upper bounds for the solution of the Stokes
equation on L3°(@). In fact, for u > 0,q € [1,00] and (z,x,L,u9) € Ex/2 x R" x Ry x L®(Q) define

~3y z|H/2
B,(z,x,L, uo) := |Molln(B@,Lyn@)lZl “4 + |IUolloo Ct ge

Then the following result holds.

Theorem 3.10 ([22]). Let n > 3, 2 C R" be an exterior domain of class Cl where 1>3.and1> n/2and
let 0 € (0, /2),q €[1, 00] and zp > 0. Then there exist constants C, Cz, > 0 such that

|(Too(Z)uo)(x)| < C Bg(z,x,L, uo) + Czy sup Bg(z,&,L, uo),
