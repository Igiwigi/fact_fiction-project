Towns in Okushiri had been protected by a 4.5m high seawall,
constructed in the aftermath of the 26 May 1983 tsunami. They were overtopped at places by an
11m tsunami flood [25]. Shuto & Fujima [25] stated that ‘This fact called for serious reflection to
the conventional method after 1960 that relied mainly on structures’. The event generated a high-
quality inundation dataset in a geographical setting where a fairly accurate determination of the
seafloor motion could be made post facto. The latter is important because tsunami predictions can
only be as good as the estimates of the source characteristics that produced them, i.e. the estimates
of the initial condition for the hydrodynamic simulations.
