for example includes as a limiting case the hydrodynamical vortex atoms of Lord
KELvIN, in which the constitution is purely gyrostatic but the number of degrees of
freedom is infinite. It will be convenient for this purpose to change to new
coordinates of which ¢,0, + ¢,4, + ....-+ ¢,4, is one, say the one with suffix unity :
and to choose them semi-normal, so that the potential energy is represented by a
character, compared with ordinary molecular encounters, is in keeping with the rapid disintegration
and eyaporation of metallic plates under its influence. It is conceivable that the long-continued
Becquerel radiation from fatigued phosphorescent substances arises in like manner from very sudden
release cf their molecules into new groupings, in the course of their gradual return to a natural or
unfatigued configuration.

* The periods of small free vibrations, and the amplitudes of small forced ones, would not be affected
by reversal of all the gyrostatic momenta in the system: in fact this reversal would just change the

system into its optical image.

sum of squares, which would be all necessarily positive if there were no gyrostatic
influence. It may then be shown in the manner of the preceding analysis that
A/P, is equal to a fraction of which the denominator is the period determinant of the
molecule and the numerator is the minor of its leading term ; the numerator is there-
fore the period determinant of the same molecule when its leading coordinate is
