There is, however, other evidence that the value of p for sea water is about 1:

(a) The use of an immersion microscope (Jenkins eé¢ al. 1941) has established that the
particles which cause scattering in sea water are nearly all of diameter less than 25,000A
and not primarily plankton, air bubbles, or grains of sand. They may include very finely
dispersed clay (Sverdrup et al. 1942). On the other hand, Clarke & James (1939) showed that
very efficient filtration of sea water with a Berkfeld filter can reduce the scattering coefficient
almost to zero, the filtrate having in the green and red portions of the spectrum the same
extinction coefficients as distilled water; values of p exceeding about 2 (i.e. D/A ratios smaller
than 0-6) may therefore be uncommon.

(b) The ratio of the light scattered upwards to that travelling downwards within the
water is in fact small (Atkins & Poole 1940; Sverdrup et al. 1942), suggesting an indicatrix
of diffusion corresponding to a D/A ratio exceeding 0-5, that is, a p value of less than 2.

(c) It will be shown in part III of this paper that measurements of extinction coefficients
with narrow band filters in a modified Pulfrich photometer have given p values varying
between the limits 0-7 and 1-5.

(2) Extinction coefficients calculated from brightness profiles agree well with theoretical
coefficients based on a p of 1.

It will therefore be assumed that in normal coastal water, the scattering coefficient #
varies inversely as about the first power of the wave-length over the red and green portions
of the spectrum. Because the effective wave-lengths of the filters used in this work are
