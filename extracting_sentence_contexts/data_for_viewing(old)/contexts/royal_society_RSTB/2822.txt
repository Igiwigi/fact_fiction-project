later than the latter, while similar tissues take part in the formation of both. If
both arose simultaneously close to the apex, the early distinction of them would be a
matter of difficulty, though they are parts of different morphological character. It is
possible thus to contemplate the origin of parts of similar cellular structure, but
not morphologically comparable with one another, laterally upon the same axis.

The occurrence of middle forms between the teeth of the normal annulus and
sporangiophores appears at first sight important evidence ; but, as is well known,
intermediate forms occur between ovules and foliage leaves, and, nevertheless, the
opinion is widely accepted that the ovule, like other sporangia, is an organ sui generis,
and not the result of modification of a leaf or leaf-segment.

The strength of the view stated by Goren lies in the fact that it is supported by
all three lines of argument above noted, and if it were not for the fossils it would
probably not be called in question. But comparison with them suggests an alternative
view, viz., that the sporangiophores are not of the nature of phyllomes, but are
comparable rather with the sporangiophores of the Psilotacewe or Sphenophylleee ;
these they certainly resemble in form and function, though they differ from most of
them in maintaining no strict relation of position to the true leaves. This suggestion
must now be examined,

It is based primarily upon those Calamarian strobili in which each leaf-whorl is
regularly succeeded by a whorl of sporangiophores. In the strobili the leaves of
successive whorls show a radial alternation, as in the vegetative shoot, and it seems
natural to suppose that they accordingly correspond to the ordinary succession of
