the question at T’=0 [the absolute zero of temperature]. There a metal conducts, and a
non-metal doesn’t.

(Edwards 1998)

Of the many pieces of work showing Mott’s most profound insights (Edwards &
Rao 1985, 1995; Davis 1998, 2007; Redmer et al. 2010), the metal-non-meta’
transition, generally called the Mott transition, is in our view a most influentia:
contribution. Mott discussed this complex phenomenon not only in terms of
a coherent theory, but also provided key operational experimental criteria for
understanding the location of the Mott transition and its signature electronic
features. Almost certainly, the very first attempts to explain the occurrence of
metals and non-metals—in fact, predating the efforts of Mott—-were made as
remarkable contributions by Goldhammer (1913) and Herzfeld (1927). This old
and, until recently, half-forgotten pre-quantum theory allows one to extract and
use deep insights into the fundamental issues of atomic properties, and elementa
densities which make an element or substance metallic or non-metallic. Here
again, as we hope to illustrate, this approach is invaluable for the experimenta
study of complex phenomena in complex systems!

2. The electrical properties of matter

It has been known since the earliest studies of electrical currents in substances
that metals conduct electricity well and most other materials do not. Just how
remarkable are metals as ‘... magnificent conductors of electricity’ (Cottrell 1991)
