Evidently, therefore, the flow through a wood vessel filled with water is strictly
proportional to the viscosity of the latter, the differences between the observed and
calculated amounts being within the limits of experimental error. None of the
vessels were open at both ends, and hence the viscosity factor affects the filtration
under pressure through the partition walls in the same way that it does the flow
through the length of the vessels.

Section 19.â€”The Relation between Water-Transport, Wood-Production, and the
Rigidity of a Stem.

The fact that the water is mainly or entirely transferred by the young wood is well
known, but it is not known whether the continued production of new wood is solely
to increase the rigidity of the stem, or whether it takes place because wood is only
capable of transporting water for a limited time. In the first case the water would
simply flow through the younger wood because this formed the easier path, but in
the second case a continued production of new wood, far beyond the mechanical
requirements of the tree, would become a necessity. For if a pumping action is
exercised by the wood-parenchyma cells, it will cease as the vital activity of these
cells diminishes with age, and hence the older wood, though still capable of
transmitting water forced in by pressure, will be unable to aid in driving it upwards.
