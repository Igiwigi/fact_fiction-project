According to our previous and current data, the difference in the band
positions is not significant in the data taken at the 532 and 514nm excitation wavelengths. Oren
et al. [32] reported that the major pigments present in the orange layer, derived from the oxygenic
phototrophs, were myxoxanthophyll, echinenone and f-carotene. The pigments are occurring at
roughly the same concentration [32], and the resulting spectra are consistent with this fact. The green layer is of special interest because the majority of the pigment content consists
of chlorophyll-a. In contrast to the carotenoid pigments, the chlorophylls do not cause the
resonance effect when 514, 532 or 785nm excitation wavelengths are used; therefore, no signal
from chlorophyll-a was observed in the spectra.
