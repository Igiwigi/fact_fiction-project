Interpretation of the distortions in electric lines of force associated with an
accelerated charge as a consequence of breaking of the translational symmetry of the electric field
in the radial direction within a localized region of space and time due to rotation of the electric
field, which results in generation of electromagnetic waves as shown in figure 3b, was published
recently [34,35]. Thus, although a periodic acceleration of the dipole configuration of charged
particles results in electromagnetic radiation which is associated with generation of rotating
electric field in space is well known, its correlation to loss of temporal and spatial invariance
of the associated Lagrangian has remained unnoticed, for long. In fact, it is an instance of explicit

Figure 2. Explicit symmetry breaking in potential surfaces. (a) A body (light blue ball) placed at the symmetrical peak of the :8
potential energy surface is not subjected to a net force due to symmetry. Its symmetry can be explicitly broken within a localized pra)
region of space, by displacing it towards the edge of the potential surface when it is under some finite force field which can :z
result in change in momentum. (b) The black ball in the figure in a potential well is under a net force due to explicit symmetry :
breaking of the potential energy surface within the localized region of the body.
