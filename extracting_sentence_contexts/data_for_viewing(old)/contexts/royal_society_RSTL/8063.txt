28, From Table VIII. we obtain the following epochs for the minima and maxima of
the longer period of solar disturbances ;—

Minimum Nov. 28, 1833

Magmam” I 7 Dec. 21, 1836
Minimum Sept. 21, 1843
Menu .. > Nov. 14, 1847
Minimum April 21, 1856
Maximum Sept. 7, 1859

Minimum Feb. 14, 1867 |
We deduce from these numbers, in the first instance, the fact of the variability of the
length of the whole period

Thus we have from first to second minimum . . . . . 981 years.
from second to third ,, . . . . . . 12:98 years.
from third. to fourth _ ,, . . .- . . .. 10'S1 years.

Mean of the three periods. . . 1107 years.

Secondly, we see that in all of the three cases the time from a minimum to the next
maximum is less than that from a maximum to the next minimum,—a fact which has,
we think, been previously noticed by Sir J. HersoneL, Thus the time from the first
minimum to the next maximum is 3-06 years, and from the firs: maximum to the second
