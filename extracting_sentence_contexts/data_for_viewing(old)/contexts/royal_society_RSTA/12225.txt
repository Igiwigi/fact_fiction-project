dry gaseous mixtures, such as hydrogen and oxygen, ethylene and oxygen, cyanogen
and oxygen, has been found to lower the rate of explosion. I think these results,
therefore, are strong evidence that at the extreme temperatures of the explosion-wave,
as well as in ordinary combustion, carbonic oxide is owidised by the steam, and not
directly by the oxygen.

§ 1. The fact that carbonic oxide is not acted on directly by oxygen, even in the
explosion-wave, points to the possibility that the carbon in gaseous hydrocarbons, and
in other volatile carbon compounds, is not oxidised directly to carbonic acid when
these gases are burnt with an excess of oxygen. When cyanogen, for instance, is
exploded with oxygen, the carbon may burn in one or in two stages. Each atom may
either combine directly with two atoms of oxygen to form carbonic acid, or each atom

smay combine first with a single atom of oxygen to form carbonic oxide, which after-
Svards combines with a second atom of oxygen to form carbonic acid. If the
Sxidation is effected in two stages, the chemical change first occurring, viz., the
§xidation of the carbon to carbonic oxide, must take place in the presence of an
Excess of oxygen. Will this excess of oxygen influence the velocity with which the
initiation of the chemical change is propagated, i.c., the rate of explosion? The
