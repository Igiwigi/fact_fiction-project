The change was
also of the same kind, the contents of the stomach assuming
a dark colour, and those of the pyloric end being more uni-
form, and of a firmer consistence than those of the central
and cardiac portions of the stomach, while the whole contents
became less in quantity. The division of the nerves, in both ways, produced difficulty
of breathing and efforts to vomit ; neither of which occurred
when the stomach and lungs were brought under the influ-
ence of a voltaic battery, sent through the lower portion of
the divided nerves.* Saf

When, under the foregoing circumstances, the lungs had
not been exposed to the voltaic influence, and the animal
had been allowed to live for five or six hours, they were
found much congested : in the rabbit which had been sub-
mitted to this influence, they seemed quite healthy.

* Mr. Bzopiz was not present till after the death of the animal, but this fact
was observed by Mr. Bxoucurox and others,
