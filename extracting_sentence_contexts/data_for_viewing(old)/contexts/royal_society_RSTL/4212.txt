A plate of calc-spar (formed by the natural cleavage) with oil of cassia gives
two distinet sets of bands; the one finer and narrower than the other, which
about the middle of the spectrum may be seen distinctly superimposed one on the
other.

On applying a Nicol-prism each set disappears alternately, leaving the other visible
at each quarter of a revolution of the analyser ; showing them due to the two oppo-
Sitely polarized pencils. It is easily ascertained that the finer bands belong to the
extraordinary, the broader to the ordinary ray.

(10.) A plate of quartz, cut perpendicular to the axis, with oil of sassafras, gives
very distinct bands, which may be seen to be in fact composed of two sets s8uperim-
posed and nearly coinciding, since when the plate is inclined (as in position 1, see
fig. 2) at intervals throughout the spectrum the near coincidence of the dark spaces
of one set, with the bright of the other, occasions an extreme faintness in the bands.
In this case the two pencils deviate sufliciently from the axis to approximate to plane
polarized light, and thns the Nicol-prism causes the indistinctness to disappear at
each quarter of a revolution by stopping one of them alternately.

(11.) For an explanation of the general phenomena of the formation of bands under
the conditions specified, the simple interference-theory suffices.

Of the homogeneous pencil going to form any one ray of the spectrum, that half
which passes through the thicker part of the prism is more retarded than that
