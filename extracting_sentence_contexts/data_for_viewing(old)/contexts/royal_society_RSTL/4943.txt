repeated the preceding ; but, as the filtration was less perfect, have thought it un-
necessary to give them in detail; they agreed however in the results. The whole
have confirmed in the fullest manner the experiments firs: made, and have proved,
as I trust, satisfactorily that the spermatozoa alone are those parts of the semen
which effect the impregnation of the ovum. Having repeated the filtration in five
Separate sets of experiments, on different occasions, and with exactly the same gene-
ral results, I can no longer entertain any doubt of the direct agency of the sperma-
tozoa, The conclusion, I think, is rendered certain by facts now shown, which escaped
the notice of SPALLANZANI, and of PrEvosrT and Dumas. Segmentation of the yelk
takes place earlier when impregnation is effected by a large, than when occasioned by
a very small number of spermatozoa, the temperature of the surrounding medium, and
all other circumstances, being alike in the two cases, as in the experiments Set A as
compared with Set B (p. 190). "This fact is supported by another, equally significant.
When only a very small number of spermatozoa exist in the fluid, then the remarkable
result of partial impregnation often takes place, and the oya are unproductive. On
the other hand, when spermatozoa are supplied in full abundance to the ova, not
only does segmentation of the yelks take place more rapidly, but also more exten-
sively, and almost every ovum produces an embryo.

With regard to the liquor seminis, it seems equally decisive that this portion of
