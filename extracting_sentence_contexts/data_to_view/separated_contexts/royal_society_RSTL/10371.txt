These conditions, which can really be approximately, but never perfectly, fulfilled,
may be briefly stated as three in number :—

(1.) No slipping mus take place.

(2.) Each set of rollers must always be in contact round the great circles
formed by two perpendicular (not necessarily horizontal and vertical)
diametral planes.

(3.) The axes of all the rollers mus intersect the line of intersection of the
two planes. It will be observed that nothing is said about the planes of rotation of the rollers
containing the centre of the sphere in the last condition, and the fact that this is not
necessary is taken advantage of in the lasb application which is described in this paper,

From the foregoing results it is evident that it is nob the distribution of the rollers
round the great circle that is important, but the direction of their axes. Therefore the
rollers hitherto alluded to as movable centres do not require to be placed at the points
of intersection of the diametral planes, and may be removed to snch a position that
they can never come into contact with the rollers round the horizontal great circle of
contact. At, the game time the top and bottom rollers which are not required to be
in contact with the poles of the sphere may be removed to any other convenient
position along their great circle of contact.
