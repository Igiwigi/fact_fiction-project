‘wave i, tsunami) implies a long-standing and
intuitively understood recognition of the vulnerability of
port and maritime assets to tsunamis. Indeed, historical
accounts provide us with many harrowingly descriptive
reports of tsunami effects in ports and on ships at
anchor. However, most of these accounts are from the
near field and may skew our appreciation for what
constitutes a hazardous situation in terms of tsunami
effect on ships and or maritime facilities. The line of
research discussed here has been motivated due to the
fact that tsunami damage is not exclusively caused by
surges that result in coastal inundation. Often maritime
facilities are vulnerable to tsunami-induced effects not
accompanied by flood inducing water levels and which
occur many hours after the initial tsunami arrival.
