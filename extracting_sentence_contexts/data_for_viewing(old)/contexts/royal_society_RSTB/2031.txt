ys measured, as it is so much better defined, and is moreover practically the

iven in the table at the end of the paper, the values there given being in eye-piece
scale units. If desired to reduce them to millimetres, they must be divided by 152°3.
Tt will be seen that the chief distinctions between the two parent larval forms, as
as mere measurement is concerned, lie in the fact that the Strongylocentrotus larva
