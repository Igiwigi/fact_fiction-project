substitute for the rigid space called up by the typewriter There could be no clearer example of this deficit spending

of words, depending on their relative lengths, his formatting there is representation of something rather like paint (not

programme then virtually stretched the word-string or like glue, not like sounds) that plays a role in visual


perception, and we can confirm its existence (Block thinks) by
considering empirical findings about measurable differences
in subjects’ performances in controlled experiments. The
fact that Block pursues the strategy of discussing empirical
experiments in detail shows that he is not falling in the typi-
cal philosophers’ trap of thinking the existence of what he is
now calling mental paint is just obvious, a ‘direct’ deliverance
of ‘first-person access’; he is accepting my challenge to prove
that there are qualia, and in one sense that means that he is
agreeing with me and abandoning qualia in one traditional
sense: they are not being considered by him to be introspec-
tible realities, readily confirmable by simply attending to
one’s experience. Mental paint, if it exists, is a posit of
theory, a discovery of third-person science, not first-person
observation.
