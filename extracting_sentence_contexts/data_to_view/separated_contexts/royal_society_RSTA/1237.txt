During this plume
splashback phase, the material that re-enters the atmosphere is reshocked (resetting the molecular
composition) and deposited within the middle stratosphere [175,176,179,180]. The plume re-entry
shock from the Shoemakerâ€”Levy 9 impacts was characterized by relatively low shock pressures
and high temperatures, with the maximum shock temperatures depending on the plume re-
entry vertical velocity (and thus distance from the impact site) [175]. The fact that CO was
favoured over H2O at the impact sites suggested that typical peak re-entry shock temperatures
were approximately above 1400 K during the Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacts [175,176]. In general,
CO was found to be a factor of approximately 10-100 more abundant that H2O in the Jovian
stratosphere after the impacts [176,180,181], and the CO, HCN and CS that were formed during
the plume splashback phase have persisted for years in the Jovian stratosphere [182-186], as
was predicted from photochemical models [177,187,188]. Observations suggest that these species
were introduced at pressures less than approximately 0.1 mbar after the impacts, and have
been diffusing slowly downward since that time [180,182,189].
