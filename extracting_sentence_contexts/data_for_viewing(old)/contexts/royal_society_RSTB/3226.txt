marked than in some others of our collection, but its index is not so low as at first
glance we might expect. The glabellar index, as defined by Scuwasz, depends on,
the position of the ophryon, the determination of which, as Topinarp points out,
is certainly difficult. According to Broca, it lies on the intersection of the median
line of the skull and a transverse line drawn from the most closely approximated
points of the temporal ridges. Toprinarp, however, proposes to identify it with the
inter-supraciliary point, which is determined by the intersection of the median line
and the shortest superficial curve tangential to the posterior margin of the brow
ridges. In our Australian skull the ophryon and the inter-supraciliary point are,
as a matter of fact, coincident, lying 30 millims. from the nasion, as measured in a
direct line, and 96 millims. from the bregma; the glabellar index is, therefore,
31-25 (30 x 100/96 = 81°25).

The highest glabellar index which I have so far encountered among Australian
skulls has a value of 39°76 ; it occurs in a specimen, numbered 976, from Queensland,
the nasi-ophryon line of which is 33 millims., the ophryo-bregma chord only
83 millims. in length. In another remarkable skull, also from Queensland (No. 972),
