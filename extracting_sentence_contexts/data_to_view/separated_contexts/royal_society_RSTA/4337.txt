In early 1920, the UK General Post Office issued some experimental transmitting
licences to both British and American companies. However, apart from a few radio enthusiasts
listening to these experimental broadcasts, there was no real incentive for the public at large
to purchase a technically challenging product in its early form and, as these developed, a very
expensive item for homes that only a few could afford. This was compounded by the fact that
there was little of any general interest to listen to and certainly little to fund the provision of
specifically produced content. Given this, those wishing to manufacture radio sets and their
components applied to set up a company to produce and broadcast content that people may
want to receive, and this became reality in October 1922 in the form of the British Broadcasting
Company. The infrastructure was largely set up using many of the technologies and components
developed for the telephone communication industry of the day, with increasing developments of
its own as time went on.
