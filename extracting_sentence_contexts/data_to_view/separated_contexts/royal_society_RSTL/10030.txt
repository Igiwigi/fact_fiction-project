WARD ON THE MORPHOLOGY AND THE

between the numbers, but also because the spores are too large to pass through the
8et, even 8upposing the cavity continuous and ending in an ostiolum, which is not
in the case. T have often tried to discover conidia, or other bodies in connexion with
the sete, but have been forced to the belief that they have no function whatever
connected with spore-production. One is nob now impressed with the necessity for
assigning any special function to such structures : if the s&@ are merely free-growing
branches of the otherwise appressed, creeping mycelium, there is nothing surprising
in the fact that some differences in form and consistency are correlated with their
sub-tierial habit. This is ab leasb no more remarkable than that the looser branches of
an alga, like Coleochete, should have a facies slightly differing from that of the cell
8eries comprising the lower, creeping, appressed parts of the thallus. The collection of sete immediately around the © fruit-body ” simply results, imme-
diately, from the vigorous development of hyphe which accompanies the later stages
of formation of the perithecium : this mass of setigerous hyphe, which seems compar-
able with the formation of haustoria and 8uch-like organs in other fungi during the
fruit development, was called the *rceptacle” by Bokxner.
