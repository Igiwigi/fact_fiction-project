Figure 1. Channel-flow DNS data of Moser et al. [56], Del Alamo et al. [57], Hoyas & Jiménez [58] and the JHTDB database [59].
(a) Mean streamwise velocity profile, in wall units; (6) friction factor f(Re) versus Re; (c) Mean streamwise velocity and (d) mean
Reynolds stress at h*| = 12 versus Re. The red dashed lines in (b—d) are power-law fits. (Online version in colour.)

To illustrate that our hypothesized bounds (4.6) and (4.7) are realistic, even as near equalities,
we show data taken from a compilation of several numerical channel flow simulations [56-59],
to cover a range of Reynolds numbers Re = 2HU/v = 13755-86902 (Rer = 395—2000). See figure 1.
These mean data all correspond to the limit T — oo in our analysis. We see in figure 1a that the
1/7 power law is a good fit to the mean streamwise velocity profile over most of the channel
width, except in the viscous sublayer where u, ~ y+. Best fits reveal, in fact, that the power
m is slowly decreasing with Re. Figure 1b shows that the drag law is Blasius-like, but with an
exponent somewhat smaller than 1/4. The plots in figure 1c,d show that our hypotheses (4.6) and
(4.7) are reasonable if one takes h = 12v/u,, with both mean streamwise velocity and Reynolds
stress exhibiting near power laws. From the best-fit exponents, we find that (m+ n)/(1+1n)=
0.211 which may be compared with p=0.2347. The agreement is very reasonable given that
the simulations considered use different codes and numerical resolutions and have somewhat
different aspect ratios. It would obviously be better to have data from several runs of a single
numerical scheme over a span of Reynolds numbers.

Because our results are closely related to those of Prandtl [21-23], we must briefly compare
both our methods and our conclusions. In what is now standard practice [33], Prandtl very simply
obtained the drag law by averaging the mean streamwise velocity profile in the form
