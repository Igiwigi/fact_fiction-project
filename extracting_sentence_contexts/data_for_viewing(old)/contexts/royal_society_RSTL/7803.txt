452 PROFESSOR HEER ON THE FOSSIL FLORA OF NORTH GREENLAND.

at Tglutsiak, near Godhayn ; 2nd, at Signifik, between the last-named place and Flak-
kerhuk; 3rd, at Ujarasusuk (Ujarasuksumitok) ; and 4th, at Kulfelden (Kudliset).
Specimens from these places are in the University Museum at, Copenhagen, and on my
return I obtained, through the courtesy of Professor JouxsmRUP, duplicate specimens from
the first two named. Until the time of our visit leaves had not, however, been found,
with the exception of a few specimens by Dr. LyaLL. Amber had, however, been found
at several places, and from this fact, and from the statement by Gresecks, that he had
himself observed impressions of leaves, there was little doubt but that a more careful
search would yield results. Tt was most important to find the place spoken of by
G1z8ECKE as Ritenbenk's Kulbrund. There was difficulty in doing s0: the natives differed
among themselves; but we now know that this name is applied equally to all the places
along the Waigat coast of Disco from which coal has been taken for Ritenbenk. At
the present time coal for that colony is only taken from one place on Disco, namely,
Ujarasuksumitok ; but it has been taken from several others, and hence we were much
puzzled to determine the precise point to which G1zSECKE referred.

* On arrival at Ujarasuksumitok it was found that the coal was exposed in the cliff by
the shore, at a height of about 50 Å¿eet above the sea. It had been worked a length of
50 feet to a depth of 44: one could not say what was the entire depth of the seam, as
