melanophores and xanthophores. The study of interactions involving iridophores is ongoing, and
agent-based models (ABMs) are being used for theoretical analyses [13,14,21-24].

Nakamasu et al. [25] investigated how melanophores and xanthophores affect each other’s
survival by using a laser to erase pigment cells in the middle of the formed pattern. The results
are summarized in figure 2a. At close range, melanophores and xanthophores kill each other
(thus suppressing survival) [25]. However, the opposite is true at long distances. When the laser
kills all the xanthophores in a large area, cell death also occurs in the melanophores, indicating
that xanthophores located at a distance are necessary for the survival of melanophores [25].
Mathematically, the network of interactions shown in figure 2a has similar properties to that of
the original Turing’s model, as it includes both activation loops working at short distances and
inhibition loops working at long distances [15]. In fact, a simple ABM created using this network
can form stripes from random patterns. [21-24]. A three-cell network model with iridophores is
shown in figure 2b.
