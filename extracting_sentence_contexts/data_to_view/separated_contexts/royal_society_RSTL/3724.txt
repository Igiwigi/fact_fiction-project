WHEATSTONE ON NEW INSTRUMENTS AND PROCESSES FOR

of the principal results which have been deduced from it. It will son be perceived
how the clear ideas of electro-motive forces and resistances, substituted for the vague
notions of intensity and quantity which have been 80 long prevalent, enable us to
give satisfactory explanations of most important phenomena, the laws of which have
hitherto been involved in obscurity and doubt. Viewing the laws of the electric
circuit from the point at which the labours of On bas placed ns, there is scarcely
any branch of experimental science in which 80 many and such yarious phenomena
are expressed by formulz of such simplicity and generality ; in most of the physical
sciences the facts of observation and experiment have kept pace with theoretical ge-
neralization, in this science alone they had gone on accumulating in prolific abundance
without any successful attempt having been made to reduce them to mathematical ex-
pression, But this is now happily effected, and what has hitherto been mere matter
of speculative conjecture is removed into the domain of positive philosophy. By electro-motive force is meant the cause which in a closed circuit originates an
electric current, or in an unclosed one giyes rise to an electroscopic tension. By re-
sisfance is 8ignified the obstacle opposed to the passage of the electric current by the
bodies through which it has to pass; it is the inverse of what is usually called their
conducting power.
