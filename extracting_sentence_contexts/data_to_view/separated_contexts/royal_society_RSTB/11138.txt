While cultural evolution studies typically emphasize
that they make in themselves. Women with middle school equilibria resulting from dynamic models of social learning
or higher educational levels have the slowest progressions processes, we are limited to the use of crude proxies for trans-
to last births. This interpretation must remain fairly guarded mission dynamics such as geographic proximity to market
given that women with intermediate educational levels in fact towns and kinship norms (matri-/patri-lineality). Without
show the fastest progression to last births, meaning that any being able to link transmission mechanisms directly with out-
effects of education on ALB are not linear. Furthermore, the comes, we are unable to interpret patterns in terms of specific
