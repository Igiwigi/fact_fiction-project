13.125 grains of: crystallized ferroprussiate' of potash afford
12.33 grains of nitre, which: contain 5.8 of potash.* By heating
nitric acid in excess on'21 grains of ferroprussiate of. lead,I
obtained 2,625/grains of peroxide of iron, equivalent to 1.8g75
of the metal. Hencel infer, that the iron in the ferroprussiate
of lead'is in the metallic state ; for the- joint weights of the
carbon' and azote contained in 7 \grains of the dry acid is
5.0477 and the difference, 1.9523, approaches too closely
to the above quantity, 1.8375, for us to suppose the metal to
be in the state of protoxide. . In fact, 2.625 parts of peroxide
x 0.9=2.362 of protoxide, is a quantity much beyond what
experiment shows tobe present.

* By careful desiccation, 1.69 grains of water, may be Separated from 13.125
grains of the salt.
