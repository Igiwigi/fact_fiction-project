Prediction of lifestyle (e.g. biotrophic versus
saprotrophic), the presence of pathogenicity factors and other
elements in the genome are known to be linked to pathogen-
icity. It will still be some time before such information is
known for a sufficient number of fungi to rely solely on
genome scans. But it is relevant to consider the fact that such
an approach would allow much more predictive and preventa-
tive action than any name-based biosecurity system. Until
such information is available for all actionable quarantine
organisms, a more detailed identification system is urgently
needed and in many cases it is already feasible.

4. Latent or endophytic fungal infections

Apart from systematic problems to identify fungal threats in
traded plants and plant products, biosecurity is also currently
unable to deal with the cryptic nature of fungal infections.
