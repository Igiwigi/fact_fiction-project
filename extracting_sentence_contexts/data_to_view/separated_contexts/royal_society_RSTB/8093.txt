In some parts of Africa,
unsustainable harvesting is putting added pressure on
stocks. An important driver is the widespread avail-
ability of firearms (Jaarsveld et al. 2005). Nevertheless, despite the fact that unsustainable
trade in bushmeat is regarded as a threat to wildlife,
Cowlishaw et al. (2005) found some evidence of sus-
tainable harvesting after the extinction (through
historical hunting) of key species. After vulnerable

Current trends in land use, including expansion of | ducers) are then harvested and traded at sustainable

to sustain food production and maintain the habitats from according stricter protection to key species but
of wild food species (Foley et al. 2005).
