WITH HEAD-PROCESS AND PROCHORDAL PLATE. 457

Whilst in the Loris and Dobbin embryos, the lateral bands of “ gastral ” mesoderm
are confined to the cranial region of the head-process, it is of considerable interest to
recall that Wrnson and Hr (1907) have shown that in early embryos of Ornitho-
rhynchus, the caudal portion of the archenteric plate (head-process) extending
forwards from the primitive (HENsEN’s) knot, is distinguishable into a median portion
destined to form the chorda-plate and thickened lateral portions which lie in series
with the lateral masses (‘protosomites”) of the primitive knot and which are
destined to become converted into “gastral” mesoderm. As may be seen from
Witson and Hit1’s figures (ef. especially figs. 63-66, Plate 12), these lateral portions
of the Ornithorhynchus plate are strikingly similar to our lateral mesodermal bands
in their relations. The facts suggest that the head-process was originally capable of
producing “ gastral ” mesoderm along its entire length.

(ii) Mesoderm, Primitive Streak and Cloacal Membrane.—Laterally the most cranial part
of the head-process passes on each side into continuity with a mesodermal sheet situated
between the shield-ectoderm and the yolk-sac endoderm and attached margi nally to the
mesothelial investment of the amnio-embryonal and yolk-sac vesicles. The limits
between the head-process and the said mesodermal sheets are not sharp enough to
permit of the precise delimitation of the head-process, but the latter probably does not
extend laterally beyond the limiting lines indicated in text-figs. 1 and 8.

The existence of the “ primary ” or extra-embryonal mesoderm in the human embryo
makes the analysis of the mesoderm situated laterally to the axial structures some-
