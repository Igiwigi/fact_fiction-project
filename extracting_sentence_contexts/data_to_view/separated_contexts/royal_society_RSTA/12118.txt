Hence the only thing that requires re-adjustment in order to vary the number of
times light goes round, is d, the setting forward of the front mirror. The 45° bevel at the ends of this mirror is to enable the whole of its (silvered) face —
to be utilised, and to allow a beam which just misses it to graze past it ne
into the telescope. (See Plate 31). ;

With the front mirror 4 inches long, and the centre of semi-transparent mirror
inches back from the 38-inch square formed by the other three mirrors, the most freq
adjustment has been to set the front mirror 1 inch forward. A parallel beam inci
on the centre of semi-transparent mirror, at 45°, must now go three times ro
the frame, rebounding three times from each of the three mirrors, and twice from

* This fact makes the bands more susceptible to some kinds of disturbance, e.g., irregulariti
