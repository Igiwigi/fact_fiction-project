We note that Li agrees with the other elements in making
P(o#)# VS(1), and it differs also in the same direction. The form of VD recalls at once the formula for the F sequences found in Cs and Rb. In fact, a RypBERG form would well serve it. To test this we can find the differences
in successive wave-numbers. They are entered in the table above with the other
elements, and an inspection leaves no doubt but that here we have the F type.
