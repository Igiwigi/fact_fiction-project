In the lower jaw of
Skull Z there are thirty-four teeth on the right side and thirty-seven on the left; they
are larger and longer than the teeth of the upper jaw, and they have sharp, hooked
points, resembling the spines of the bramble. The total number of teeth found in
Skull X is 144, in Skull Y 149, and in Skull Z 149, but Escurrcur (10, p. 90) puts
the total number of teeth in Megaptera foetuses at 186. The hyoid bar is of the same shape in Skulls Y and Z as in Skull X, although the
transverse axis tends to become straighter as development proceeds ; the increase in
size may be gauged from the fact that fig. 16, A, representing the hyoid of Skull Z,
is of the natural size, whereas fig. 1, D, of the hyoid of Skull X, is enlarged (x 1°8).
