It was thought conceivable that the ionisation at low pressures might be due to
the gas molecules hitting the hot wire and becoming ionised thereby. If we assume
that the maximum current would correspond to each molecule producing one ion, we
can calculate its value in any given case. If we take the number of molecules in a
cubic centimetre of gas at 0° C. and 760 millims. to be 2 x 10!, then the number
which hit unit area of the wire per second is 42 X 2 X 10" approximately, where w
(the square root of the mean velocity square) may be taken as 5 X 10* centims. per
second for air. The number which strike unit area of the wire per second at
1 millim. pressure is therefore 2°2 x 10°, which gives a saturation current of
14°3 X 10! electrostatic units, or 47°3 ampbres per square centimetre. At a pressure
‘0016 this current would become ‘08 ampére per square centimetre. As a matter of
fact, during the experiments, a current of 2°0 amperes per square centimetre was
obtained at *0016 millim. pressure. This is twenty-five times the maximum value
obtained by supposing each molecule to produce one ion; so that it is highly
improbable that any considerable part of the conductivity investigated is due to ions
produced in this way.

Another way of considering this question is to calculate the number of times each
molecule of air inside the cylindrical electrode must collide with the filament per
second to produce the observed current, assuming that each collision sets free one
corpuscle. In the experiments in question the cylinder had a volume of about
1 cub. centim., so that each molecule present would have to pass backwards and
forwards between the filament and the cylinder some 10° times each second, This
seems to be an impossible feat for an uncharged molecule.
