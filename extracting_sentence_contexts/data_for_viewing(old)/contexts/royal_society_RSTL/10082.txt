(Received March 8, 1882.)

Note 1. —On Horny Seales and other Appendages of Carboniferous Amphibians.

T have discussed these at some length in my © Air-breathers of the Coal Period,”
and as few new facts occurred in the more recent explorations, I have merely adverted
to them in the text. It has however been s8uggested to me that some more detailed
reference to them would be desirable.

T have referred to this kind of cuticular covering as being found in connexion with
the bones of Hylonomus Lyelli and Dendrerpeton Acadianum and D. Oweni. It may
have been present in other species, but of course was likely to be preserved only in
rare instances. The examples figured in Plates 40 and 45 may serve to give an idea of
the perfect manner in which it has sometimes retained its characters, though unfortu-
nately, from the uneven and irregular surface of the deposits in the interior of erect
trees, it is always folded and crushed, 80 that it does nob retain its original form.

It is to be observed that in the species referred to, the bhorax and abdomen were
