which forms the genu is supplied in most cases by the anterior cerebral artery,
while the part of the posterior limb which contributes to form the genu is supplied
by the posterior communicating artery. I would, therefore, wish to refer to a


â€œDIFFERENT ARTERIES SUPPLYING THE HUMAN BRAIN, 19

paper* by Sir Vicror Horstey and myself in which we showed in the monkey
(Macacus sinicus) that electrical stimulation of the fibres in the anterior part of the
genu at the most posterior part of the anterior segment of the internal capsule
produced conjugate movements of the eyes to the opposite side. As this posterior
part of the anterior segment has a different blood supply from the posterior segment,
it is probable that this fact may explain how, in hemiplegia due to thrombosis of
the posterior communicating and anterior choroid arteries supplying the posterior
segment of the internal capsule, the fibres in the anterior segment, which on
stimulation produce conjugate movement of the eyes to the opposite side, may escape,
and the paralytic symptom of conjugate deviation of the eyes towards the side of
lesion may be absent ; whereas in cases of hemiplegia due to a large hemorrhage
from the middle cerebral artery, there is nothing to prevent the extravasation of
blood from destroying the fibres of the anterior segment of the internal capsule, and
so produce conjugate deviation of the eyes away from the paralysed side.

The Anterior choroid artery not only supplies the posterior two-thirds of the
posterior segment of the internal capsule, but also the medullated white matter, which
has. been called the retro-lenticular fibres, extending posteriorly to the capsule as far
