Another, indirect effect is that
magnetohydrodynamic and kinetic approaches will predict different macroscopic plasma
conditions such as electron temperature, which will then have a significant impact on their
prediction for the Biermann-producing electric field. We use the general definition of temperature
as the second moment of the electron distribution T, = (m,-v?/2) and thus it is defined even when
the distribution is non-Maxwellian. The reason for the large discrepancy between the electron temperature in MHD and kinetic
simulations is due to kinetic non-local effects on the electron heat flow qe, the same as for the
Biermann-producing electric field (in fact more important as the heat flow depends on faster, less
collisional electrons). The most commonly applied fix to this problem in MHD is to artificially
limit the electron heat flow when the model predictions become unphysically large (this does not
occur in the kinetic model which accurately captures non-local effects), typically limiting the heat
flow to some fraction of the free-streaming limit qg [15]. The free-streaming limit expresses the
