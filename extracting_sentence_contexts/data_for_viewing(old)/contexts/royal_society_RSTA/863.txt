Here we have used Parseval’s identity for Fourier transforms which implies

(we w)(k,«) = I, ti(k, A)i'(A, K) dd = (fb « ’)(k, «)

for any two functions w, w’ € L?(R?;C). Hence we see that for f* =f*(c), we have

ft =i) * otmc™ o ft =i) * att.

m=0 m=0

Further we note that if q(x, y; t) = 5(x — y) + q'(x,y;#), then q(k, x; t) = 5(k — «) + q’(k,«; £). The Dirac
delta function 6 here also represents the identity with respect to the ‘*’ product so that for any
w €L?(R?;C) we have w* 5 =5 x w =w. With all this in hand, we can in fact explicitly solve for
p=plk,«;t) and q = 4q(k, x; t) as follows.

Lemma 3.5. Let p = p(k,«;t) and q = q(k,x;t) denote the two-dimensional Fourier transforms of the
solutions to the linear base and auxiliary equations just above. Assume that q(x,y;0)=6(x — y) and
p(x, y; 0) = po(x,y). Then for all t > 0 the functions p and @ are explicitly given by

p(k, x; t) = exp(—ith(27ik))po(k, x)
and qk, «; t) = exp(—ith(—2zik)) - exp*(t(F*(fo * pd) + ih-5))(k,«;#),
where naturally exp*(c) =6 +c + 3c + ters fee

Proof. The explicit form for p = p(k,«; t) follows directly from the Fourier transformed version
of the base equation. We now focus on the auxiliary equation. Consider a typical term say ¢*” in
