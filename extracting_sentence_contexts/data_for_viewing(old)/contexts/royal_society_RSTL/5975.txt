102 DR. T. WILLIAMS'S RESEARCHES ON THE STRUCTURE AND HOMOLOGY

boundaries and float in the neighbouring fluid. It will be observed at. once that a most
constant and intimate organic connexion exists between the mASSes (f. 9 and 6, b) and |
the coiled tubes of their respective sides. 'The ova on the ome side, and the sperm-celly
on the other, may be actually seen by the eye, on many occasions, rolling to and fro in
the interior of the dilated portions of the tubes (a, &). 6 v [

To this Annelid no further reference will be necessary, Since in every particular the
sexual system conforms with the type of that of Nais. In the young of this worm the
ordinary segmental organ exhibits the form shown at fig. 3, B.

It seems to the author that a candid review of the preceding facts must inevitably
conduct to the conclusion that, in this species (which is evidently intermediate between
Nais and the common Earth-worm), the ovaries on the one side and the testes on the
other are not, only organically connected with, but are ingrafted upon, and developed
from, the standard or normal segmental organ.

In the course of his researches the author has accidentally fallen upon other species
of Lumbrici. more or less favourable to the study of this question. In L. Kanii, mihi,
in the young tate, the segmental organ may frequently be discovered in a condition
highly favourable to the present investigation (e fig. 4 A). In that annulus in which the
contained ciliated tubes are destined to become the generative organs, the latter appear
at first under the character represented at c (fig. 4 B). From one side of the mid-portion
of the tube (as at c, 4 C) may be observed to bulge minute pear-shaped vesicles, filled with
