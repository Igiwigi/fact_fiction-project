processus brevis. Apart from the attachment to the tympanic membrane and, of course,
the articulation with the incus, the malleus seems to have little support. ‘There is no
trace or sign of a superior ligament and the censor tympani is very weakly developed and,
in this stage of development at all events, consists only of a small bundle of fibres
running near the canalis facialis which are not in any way attached to the malleus.
Whether they are so eventually or are vestigial cannot be told. This absence of ligaments

no doubt accounts for the fact that in dried skulls the malleus is always loose, and rattles
when the skull is shaken. Its comparative great size and weight is sufficient for any
small shock to loosen it from the dried tympanum.

Text-Fic. 2.—Section (No. 302) showing the malleus at the point where the manubrium, with its internal
process, is attached to the tympanum. Cartilage is closely dotted. The embryonic “ jelly ” which
at this stage fills most of the middle ear, except below the manubrium, is sparsely dotted. Ossification,
e.g., in the squamosal, tympanic ring and elsewhere, is shown by irregular black lines. Nerves are
black. AS., Alisphenoid. SQ., Squamosal. VIIL., Branches of the seventh nerve. T'T., Small bundles
of fibres representing the vestige of the tensor tympani. CHT., Chorda tympani. TY., Tympanic ring.
The ring is ossified: between it stretches the beginning of the tympanum. The digitate body just
outside the junction of the manubrium and the tympanic membrane is the tract, as yet unopened, of
the external auditory meatus. TH., Tympano-hyal, above which is a large vein. STA., Stapedial
