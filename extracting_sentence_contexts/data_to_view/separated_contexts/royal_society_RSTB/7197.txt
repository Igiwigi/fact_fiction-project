On comparing these results with the previous ones, it is clear that a different fixation
point is used for yellow rays from that used for green rays. This fact will be referred to in
the next section.

(148) The positions of the fixation points for different colours

Evidence was produced (in § 120, p. 613) that different fixation points are used for rays of
different colour. In the case of the author’s left eye, the red fixation point was found to be below, and to
the left of, the green one, whereas the blue fixation point was below, and to the right of,
the green one. It should be noted that this description applies to the apparent positions of
these points in the visual field, and not to their actual positions in the retina.
