ij Although determination of blood, as met with in the frog, is thus entirely inde-

+ Since tho reading of the paper, T have pointed out, that in consequence of the persistent fluidity of the
blood which continues in the smaller vessels for days after death, the red corpuscles have time to gravitate
into dependent parts, and thus give rise to that appearance of post-mortem congestion which more or less
