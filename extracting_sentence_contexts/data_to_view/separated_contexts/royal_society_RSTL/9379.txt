It
is in the essential characters of the individual cells of these layers, in the relationship
of these anatomical units the one to the other, and in their general distribution, that
we detect divergence from the type normal to the higher Mammalia. These diver-
gencies, we shall find, appear very strongly pronounced as further on we enter into a
close examination of the constitution of each individual layer of the cortex. It is
important that we bear in mind the homologous constitution of the cortical layers in
distant groups of Mammals, and that we are alive to the fact that minute differences
in elementary distribution may afford suggestive hints as to any existing analogy in
functional endowments. Tt will be apparent, upon the most superficial examination of
this snbject, that it is of the highest importance that we define as accurately as possible
the regions characterised by these diverse laminar arrangements; and the contrast
esxtablished between the comparative area, of these realms in different orders must be
regarded as highly desirable, What is the relative area borne by the five- to the 8ix-
laminated region in individual groups of animals, and what is the relative extent of
similarly laminated regions in different orders? These are questions which require
careful and deliberate consideration, and towards the solution of which the following
researches are devoted.
