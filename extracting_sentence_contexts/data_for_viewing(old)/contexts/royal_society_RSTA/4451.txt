of re-coring of this frozen lake water were influenced by the old borehole geometry and went out
into the pristine glacial ice. Three ice samples of this 32m long ice core (from the topmost full-
cylinder ice core containing kerosene in bubbles to the bottommost moon-shaped ‘milky’ ice),
hereafter borehole-frozen water, were provided for microbiological analyses.

The second entry into the lake occurred at the depth of 3769.15m some 3 years later, on 25
January 2015. The water rose up again into the borehole to the level of about 70 m and was left to
freeze. In 4 days, drillers re-cored the icy ‘cork’ and obtained about 12 m of the new fast frozen
lake water core before the water came up again into the borehole and finally froze at the level
of 65-67 m above the ice-water interface. The bottommost 10cm (of 12m core) frozen water ice
segment was provided for microbiological studies.

However, despite the fact that the Russians were the first to enter a subglacial Antarctic lake at
such a great depth (3769 m) and were able to perform the lake entry twice, the drilling technology
used (electromechanical drill along with kerosene drilling fluid with the use of foranes (namely
Freon 141B, 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane, as densifier)) proved to be inappropriate to collect
liquid water in general and clean samples in particular. More technological developments are
needed to face such a challenge, including the development of sophisticated systems consisting
of well-sealed transport modules preventing the contamination of in-module-encapsulated
devices/samplers with the drilling fluid [11] as well as the use of thermal drilling just before
the next lake entry, which is now under discussion.

The main objective of this study was to search for resident microbial life in the subglacial Lake
