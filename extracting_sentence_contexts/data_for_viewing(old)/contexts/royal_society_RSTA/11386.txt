equal; their degree of sensible divergence will depend on the nature of the primitive
frequency distribution for parents.

(d.) If fertility be inherited, or reproductive selection be an actual factor of
evolution, then we see, by comparing (v.) with (i.) and (vii.) with (viii.), that the
mean fertility of mothers will always be apparently greater than the mean fertility
of daughters. This follows, since 7 is always less than unity, and if the race be not
subjected to secular evolution, other than that due to reproductive selection, o,
cannot differ very widely from o,.*

(e.) An argument from means, as to whether fertility is inherited or not, is very
likely to be misleading. We may choose two groups from the record for comparison,
neglecting the fact that their frequency in the record is not necessarily that of their
frequency in the general population. Thus, if one person, say, in four were married,
a marriage record of the community might exhibit the proper frequency of families
of four, but it would not do so of families of one. The sort of fallacious arguments
we have to be prepared for are, for example :

(i.) That the fertility of the community is diminishing, because M’, is less
than M’,.

(ii.) That the fertility of the community is increasing, because M’, might be > M,
or M”, be > M’,.

(iii.) That fertility is not inherited, because, owing to natural selection, or other
