and therefore

and since
x = (E+H)(w—v) and x, = E (w—~),
we have
H (w—wy) = x-Xo

or writing w—wy = Awy, the change in the mean specific volume of the water, we

have
Awy = Ax/H,

which also obviously follows from the mere fact that we treat Ev, as a constant,
considering the whole contraction on dilution as due to changes in the density of the
water.

Either of the quantities Awy or Ay,/H is the contraction per gramme (or the
specific contraction) of the water of the solution.

18. Relation of Specific Heat Lowering to Specific Contraction of the Water.—In
the search for the true relation between specific heat and specific volume changes the
values of As,, were plotted on the specific contraction of the water. The values
of Ay, at 20° C., taking Ev, = 25°058, are set out in Table XIV. together with the
values of As,, and of the specific contraction. They are plotted in fig. 5.
