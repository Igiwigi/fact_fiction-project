We will change the notation later, in §8, to conform with the traditional interpretation of the a
properties and contexts involved, e.g. in a pair of two entangled particles. For now, one can a
think of any four properties measured in any four contexts so that (i) each context contains two :
properties measured together; (ii) each property is measured in two different contexts; (iii) no two Da
contexts share more than one property; and (iv) each measurement is a binary random variable, tw
with values +1.

4. Traditional understanding of contextuality in cyclic-4 systems

The traditional understanding of contextuality in the cyclic-4 paradigm can be presented as
follows. Let us assume the measurements RiRo of any property q in the contexts c,c’ in which it
is measured to be in fact one and the same random variable, Ri. This assumption can be referred
to as that of context-irrelevance, and in many traditional treatments it is made implicitly, by the
virtue of indexing the measurements by the properties being measured but not by the contexts.
The assumption implies that our matrix (3.3) can be written as
