The dissepiments are strong and are developed
sometimes as horizontal lamellee or tabulee.”

The discussion ‘On the apparent relationship of Stylophyllum with Paleozoic
corals (Calostylis and Cystiphyllwm)” leads to the statement at the end that “a group
(Stylophylline) of Triassic and Liassic corals, belonging with certainty to the
Astraeide, is, in many points about their inner structure, reminiscent of old Paleozoic
forms like Cystiphyllum and Calostylis.” This reminiscence is said to be compre-
hensible in any one of three ways :—

(1.) * Stylophyllum descends from one of the Paleozoic genera.”

(2.) “Stylophyllum is to be looked upon as an atavistic form.”

(3.) “It is a question of one of the frequently occurring cases among fossil corals,
that ‘hard parts very much like one another occur in very different sub-divisions’
(Neumayr).”

The last of the three explanations is the one which Professor Freon accepts, his
conclusion being : “ According to the morphological investigations, it may be presumed
that Stylophyllopsis branched off from Montlivaltia.”

Setting aside, for the present, the above statement of Frecu’s opinions, I shall
enumerate a few of the observed facts. The species Stylophyllum paradoxum,
FRrcH, is one under which an unusual variety of forms has been included. In fact,
one of the most striking features in almost any species of Stylophyllum is that few
specimens can be said to be really alike ; and that, although the differences may be
slight from one specimen to the next, there are extremes at the two ends, so to
speak, of a specific series, which seem to have little in common. This I take to be
thoroughly natural, if we regard the sub-family as a Triassic assemblage of nearly-
related specivs undergoing differentiation in one direction and another, and fairly
rapidly. Advance and retrogression would act hand in hand in such an assemblage.
