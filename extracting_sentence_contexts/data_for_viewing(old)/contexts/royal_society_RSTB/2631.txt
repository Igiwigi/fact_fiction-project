The figures, to which I have referred in discussing the septa of Palzozoic types,
serve also to show that the theca is composed of thickened portions of the septa.
NicrioLson points out that the “theca,” in the case of Zaphrentids, is probably of
epithecal nature.



262 DR. MARIA M. OGILVIE ON THE MICROSCOPIC AND

Comparing now Cyathophyllum with a recent Astreid, the homologies of parts at
once allow the broad outer peripheral dise beyond the inner tabulate area of Cyatho-
phyllum to be recognized as the representative of the “costal” area beyond the so-
called theca of Astreids, We are familiar with the fact that the aboral polypal body-
wall extends over this costal area of an Astrid and, doubling on itself, becomes then
the oval, or peristomal, body-wall, which is continued as the stomodseal wall, The
extracalycinal, or costal portion of the Astraeid skeleton, corresponds with the
“ Randplatte,” or edge-zone (vide antea, fig. 2), of the polypal flesh, and it will be
remembered that the mesenteries, in Astraids, are continued from the visceral chamber
into the edge-zone.

Looking back in the history of Astraid and Fungid evolution, it becomes all but
self-apparent that the origin of the polyp’s “ edge-zone” is to be found in that part of
the primitive Cyathophyllid polyp which clothed the “peripheral dise,” @e., the
digsepimental zone of the skeleton around the inner tabulate area. Moreover, we
find that the epitheca bears exactly the same relation to the septa in both Astreid
