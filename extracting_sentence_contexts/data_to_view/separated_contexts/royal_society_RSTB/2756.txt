The chromatophores of Hippolyte are not confined to situations where their
pigments may be optically effective. They occur not only in the skin, but invest
the liver and gut and follow the muscles in their courses. These facts, though not necessarily invalidating the hypothesis of protection, make

imperative the more difficult task of inquiring whether the chromatophore-system
of so typically a sympathetically coloured animal as IZippolyte has not some quite
unsuspected function. The first possibility which we began to consider, and with which this section is
concerned, was whether the chromatophores of Hippolyte may have some photo-
synthetic function; whether they may do for the animal what chlorophyll does for
the plant, namely, synthesise carbohydrates or some other carbon-containing
substance by the aid of radiant energy.
