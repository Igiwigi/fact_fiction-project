Now, perfect synchro-
nism I consider unattainable ; or, at all events, not worth the trouble it would
cost to pursue it: since the 8mall difference which arises, in these cases, will
always enable us to apply the proper correction, from the known principles of
the pendulum ; and which are a more sure guide on such occasions than any
partial determination of the correction from actual experiment, where, in these

minute inquiries, the errors of obseryation are sure to baffle us in our object. * Memoirs of the Astronomical Society, vol, iii. page 289,


A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM. 471

Captain Sapixng however has' preferred trusting to actual experiment for
this minute correction : and, considering that the result shown by the knife
edge A'is the nearest to the truth, he has rested on the establishment of that
result, without the requisite corroboration, by an equal number of trials, from
the other knife edge ; which are, in fact, equally essential to the establishment
of the accuracy of the whole. Thus, he has swung the pendulum 188 hours
on the knife edge A, and only 54 hours on the knife edge B. But, had this
latter knife edge been employed-during a longer period, it might probably have
tended to correct the anomaly that occurs on the face of the observations.
