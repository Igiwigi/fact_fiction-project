Such is « 8summary of the results obtained between the years 1749 and 1868, From
time to time they had been commented on by some of the most eminent physicists of
the time, and the cause of the low temperatures prevailing in the depths of tropical seas
discussed. HuMBoLDT, 80 far back as 1812, and again in his subsequent works*, contended that
«the existence of those cold layers in low latitudes proves the existence of an under-
current flowing from the poles to the equator.” In support of this hypothesis, he showed
how it explained the fact, first noticed by FRANKLIN and WILLIAMS f, that the water on
shoals in the Atlantic was many degrees lower than that surrounding them, from the cir-

Qeumstance that the deeper cold water, flowing and rising over them, displaced the warmer
Qgurface-waters $. These observations were afterwards confirmed by Du PegmT-Tnovans,
SZ VAILLANT, and others. He was further of opinion that *in the narrower seas, as well
Sas in the tropical seas which cover the cold waters from Arctic regions, all the mass of
Swater is in a state of movement.”
