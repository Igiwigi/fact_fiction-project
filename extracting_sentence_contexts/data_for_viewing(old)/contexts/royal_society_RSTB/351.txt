the blood-flow through the gland will lead to a diminished irritability of the gland,
and, therefore, to a decrease in the rate of secretion of all the constituents of saliva,
Té will lead also directly to a considerable decrease in the secretion of water, to a less
decrease in the secretion of salts, and to a still less decrease in the secretion of
organic substance. With decreased blood-flow there will be less saliva, and this will
contain a somewhat higher percentage of salts and a considerably higher percentage
of organic substance. Further, with a given decrease of blood-flow, the stronger the
stimulus, the higher will be the percentage of organic substance and of salts.

Now, sympathetic saliva is just such saliva as, from the above-mentioned facts and
deductions, we should expect to be produced by simultaneous stimulation of a secre-
tory nerve and of glandular vaso-constricted fibres. Since the decrease in the blood-
flow through the gland is much greater on stimulating the sympathetic than on bleed-
ing, the sympathetic saliva should be secreted more slowly and contain a higher per-
centage of organic substance than saliva secreted after bleeding. And this is the
case.

That the effect of decreasing the blood-flow through the gland is as we have given
it, is supported by several other experiments besides the one we have quoted here ;
but we do not enter into the matter further, for two reasons—the one that there are
certain of HrrpENHAIN’s observations which appear to be contradictory to ours, and
these we have not yet repeated, and the other that, since in the Cat stimulation
