and then (9) becomes A = A®e* (1 — e~**?) in which e~**” is the factor introduced by
the second term. This term will have an effect of less than 1 per cent. if «-?!“!? < 0-01
so that from (3) we find that if D/L exceeds 0-26, the effect of the second term may
be ignored if an accuracy of 1 per cent. is all that is required. With this approximation
equations (15) become

wherein @ has also been put equal to zero so that the cable is now supposed to lie on the
bed of the sea.

Tt will be seen that the depth D does not enter into the expression for K,. In fact
K, is the induced electric force at a height y above the cable when the depth of the sea
is infinite. Also the way in which D occurs in E, indicates that E, may be regarded
as arising from a source situated at the point y = 2D that is, at a height above the sea
equal to the depth. Thus E, is the electric force representing a reflected disturbance
due to the presence of the upper surface.

In order to study the forms of the integrals (48) it is convenient to transform them
as follows :— ’

Put m= A sinh v so that dm = A cosh v dv and m’ = A cosh v.
Then
E, = 2joI,( <-"°™* cos (Aa sinh 2) (1 +e) de,
