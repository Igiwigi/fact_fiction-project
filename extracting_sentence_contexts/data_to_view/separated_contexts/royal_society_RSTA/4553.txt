For instance, H. A.
Wusont has suggested that the negative ionisation produced by hot platinum in
air is due to traces of occluded hydrogen which are retained by the wire in a very
persistent manner. If this were the case, the small negative leak in air would be
enormously increased by allowing any considerable quantity of hydrogen to diffuse
out of the wire from inside. As a matter of fact, when hydrogen was allowed to
diffuse out of the walls of the tube at a rate corresponding to 2 cub. centims. at
