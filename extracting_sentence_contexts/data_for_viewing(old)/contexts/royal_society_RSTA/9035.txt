series, and thereby obtained the form of the function. Later the same writer,* by a
more elaborate treatment of the problem, succeeded in obtaining a solution applicable
to the most general molecular model of a monatomic gas, and used it to calculate the
numerical values of the coefficient of viscosity, heat conduction and of diffusion.

About two years before the appearance of Enskoa’s later work, a paper was published
by Cuapman,t in which he obtained the form of the velocity distribution function,
partly by using the fact that it must be an invariant. The complete solution of the
function was found by applying Maxwetu’s equation of transfer to certain odd and
even functions of the molecular velocity. The application of the solution to the
evaluation of the coefficients of viscosity, heat conduction, and so on, yielded the same
results as those afterwards obtained by Enskoa.

Cuapman and Ensxoe applied their methods chiefly to the case of a normal gas—
that is, one in which the mean free path of a molecule is small compared with the scale
of length in which the properties of the gas, e.g. temperature, vary appreciably. In
such a gas it is sufficient to include in the distribution function only the first order
derivatives of density, mean velocity, and temperature. In the present paper, the
solution is extended to gases in which this condition no longer holds. The methods of
CuapMaN and Enskoe are applicable also in this case, but the procedure actually
