But the underlying principle will remain the same. Now, when one comes to examine the distribution of almost any order, one finds
that it may be very well explained on such principles. I have here taken the
Menispermaces, but the distributions already given of the Dilleniacewe and Podos-
temacew, etc., in other papers agree perfectly well with it, and, in fact, so do most
orders. The following rough map gives sufficient to show the general outline of the
dispersal of this family.
