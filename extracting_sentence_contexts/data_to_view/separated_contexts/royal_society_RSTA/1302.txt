Since the growth of modified time x; means the growth of real time t, supercooling decreases with
increasing x;. Let us especially note that the dependence of supercooling for ellipsoidal crystals is
higher than for spherical crystals in parametric space. In fact, these dependencies change places
(figure 10b). The crystal-volume distribution function calculated accordingly to expression (4.13) at
different modified times x, is demonstrated in figure 9. As is easily seen, the distribution function
represents a truncated bell-shaped curve, which moves to the right (to larger volumes of crystals)
as time x1 increases.
