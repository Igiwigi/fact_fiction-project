Points that are not coloured correspond to combinations of excitation frequency and amplitude for which the
system does not have a steady-state solution. In this figure, all parameters are identical to those in figure 3f unless otherwise
indicated. (Online version in colour.)


persists for a period of time that is much longer than any of the systemâ€™s time constants. This
can be observed from the fact that the phase difference between perturbed and unperturbed
systems does not change significantly if we wait an additional 1000s until t= 1790 s (figure 6c). In
the experimental system, this phase stability would be limited by the presence of external noise
sources and Brownian motion.

8. Frequency tunability

A remarkable feature of our frequency-converting system is the possibility of tuning the input and
output frequencies over a broad range, both during the design phase and dynamically once the
system has been built.
