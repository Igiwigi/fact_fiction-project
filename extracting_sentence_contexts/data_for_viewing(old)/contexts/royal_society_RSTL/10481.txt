i investigation of the Lycopodine. Tb is sufficient to refer to the recent writings of
ERUCHMANN,* Tzxevs,t and Sors-LauBacn,f to indicate how actively the investi-
tion of these plants is being pursued. It had long been the wish of the author of
tHis paper to obtain material for the careful investigation of the less known members
# the Lycopodine, and especially of Phylloglossum ; the authorities of the Royal
Gardens at Kew made this known to Baron FERDINAND vox MUELLER, and from
fin there were received during the latter half of 1884 two consignments of living
Hbers of Phylloglossum Drummondii, as well as a supply of mature plants preserved
= alcohol. The tubers germinated successfully, in the propagating pits at Kew, and
the material was thus at hand for the investigation of the development and histology
& this little known plant. As cirqunstances will for the present prevent the author
m continuing his work, and as the Lycopodina are now one of the focal points of
Stanical interest, it appears desirable that the chief facts thus far acquired should at
Fico be published, while a discussion of these results, and their bearing upon recent
rvations of other forms, may for the present be postponed. The s8tructure and
development of the sporophore generation only will be described ab present. Many
of the plants now growing at Kew already bear immature gporangia, but the
description of their development will be deferred till the sporangia have arrived at
maturity, and until attempts have been made to germinate the spores : the general
treatment of the subject, will be better in place when it is seen what results, if any,
are acquired from those cultures of the spores. For similar reasons it would be both
inconvenient and inopportune now to review the writings already published by various
