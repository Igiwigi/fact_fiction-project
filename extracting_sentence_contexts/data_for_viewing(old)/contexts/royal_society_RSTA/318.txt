feedback set-up found in standard engineering textbooks. However, quantum
mechanically we cannot proceed this way!

(i) Cascaded systems

The simplest form of a network consists of a pair of cascaded systems,
as shown in figure 7. In the instantaneous feedforward limit, the output
of the second plant is dBO = dB + Indt= (5 dBO + Lydt) + Indt=

1
5S, BO + (SLi + Lo) dt.

The cascaded system in the instantaneous feedforward limit is in fact equivalent

to the single component [19]

(S2, Le, He) <1 (Si, L1, Ai) = (5251, Le + Soli, Hy + Ho + Im{ L455 L1}),

which is referred to as the series product of the two models [19].
