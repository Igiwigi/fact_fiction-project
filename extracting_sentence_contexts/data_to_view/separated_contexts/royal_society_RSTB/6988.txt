Currents in the mantle cavity. The action of the lateral cilia causes a powerful inhalant
current (figure 2, /) to be drawn in above and on both sides of the head (not merely above
and to the right as stated by Crofts (1929)). As in other zygobranchs, the exhalant current
(E) passes out through the shell apertures, a fact noted by all who have observed these
animals in life, The inhalant current, as indicated in figure 5, impinges on the osphradia
when it enters the confines of the cavity. It has already been argued (Hulbert & Yonge
1937) that the osphradia are tactile organs concerned with the estimation of sediment
brought in with the inhalant current. This matter will be reconsidered later.
