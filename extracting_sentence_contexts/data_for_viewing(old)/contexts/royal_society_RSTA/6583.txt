According to the Boltzmann equation, the charge density is determined by the electrostatic
potential via

plz) =ecofelev@-H@VkoT — olew)-1-@/kaT y (2.4)

where j14(z) and _(z) are the non-electrostatic contributions to the chemical potential of positive
and negative ions, respectively. In the following, we set 24(z) = 4—(z) =0. Note that the vertical
displacement is determined by the charge density via

Di@Zj= I dz'p(z’). (2.5)

In fact, the system of equations (2.3)—(2.5) constitutes a nonlinear integro-differential equation. In
[3-7], we have solved this differential equation numerically, and in the present communication we
obtain approximate analytic solutions. For this we choose a simplified box profile for the dielectric
profile in the form of

@= |? for z <z* (2.6)

e, forz>z*.

The interfacial width z* is constructed by integrating over z both ey! (2) according to the box
profile of equation (2.6) and the inverse dielectric profile obtained from simulations, and requiring
