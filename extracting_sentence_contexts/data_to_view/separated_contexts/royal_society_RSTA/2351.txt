The first method
applies only to particles with energies greater than or equal to 280 MeV and, even assuming
that they are present, is out of reach of present instruments; the last one is too generic to be a
fingerprint of the presence of energetic particles. The second one, the enhanced ionization of the
gas is, instead, a promising one. As a matter of fact, it was used to reveal the presence of freshly
accelerated cosmic rays in molecular clouds close to supernovae remnants, where cosmic rays are
believed to be accelerated [10-12].

Figure 1. Scheme of the reactions involving HCO* and NjH* in UV shielded molecular gas. In standard molecular gas, the
reaction with CO dominates the destruction of NpH* which leads to additional formation of HCO+ and, consequently, an
abundance ratio HOOT /N)H* >> CO/Np.
