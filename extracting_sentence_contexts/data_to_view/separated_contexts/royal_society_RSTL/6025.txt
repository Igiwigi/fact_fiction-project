But I could not help feeling that the facts and arguments which I was in a position
Â£ to bring forward would till leave the question an open one. 'They might influence the
SE opinions of others, as they had influenced mine ; but I had nothing to advance on which
S the mind could rest with perfect certainty. In short, neither the Mer de Glace nor its
: tributaries furnished facts capable of completely deciding the question. The snbject
& being one on which a great deal had been written and retracted, I was unwilling to
Swell the bulk of the literature connected with it, while a possibility remained- that
what I had to say upon the 8ubject might also require withdrawal. IT therefore thought
it better to wait another year; to extend the range of my observations, to visit glaciers
in which the mechanical conditions of strain and pressure were different from those of
the Mer de Glace.
