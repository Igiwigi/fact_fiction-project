vesicles; and no doubt contained, as in my experiment just mentioned, many unde-
veloped cells; and, consequently, not being fully matured, retained its influence
longer than it would have done, under the same circumstances, in its perfect con-
dition.

But Prevosr and Dumas||, in some experiments made to ascertain the length of
time during which the fluid of the species they experimented on,—the Rana esculenta,
—retains its feeundatory property, observed that it was efficient at {wenty-four hours,
although removed from the body and preserved during that time, in a temperature
that varied from 18 to 22 cents., or from 64' to 71* Faur. | This result, differing 0
much, in regard to temperature, from the results formerly arrived at by SPALLANZANI,
in regard to the Frog, and from the majority of those since obtained by myself, may,
I think, in great part be accounted for in the fact that, like the Toads, the Rana
