In the same manner a $till more extended similarity
between the sun and the stars offers itself, by the spots that
now must also be admitted to take place on their surfaces, as
well as on that of the sun. To return to the difficulty which has been started, it may be
further urged, that there are some reasons to surmise that the
34 Cygni is a periodical star of 18 years return; * and that
other stars seem very slowly to diminish their lustre, and may
probably recover it hereafter. In answer to this, I remark that it will not be necessary to
remove objections to the rotatory motion of the stars, inferred
from their very slowly changeable lustre, till they come pro-
perly supported by well ascertained facts. Many causes in the
physical construction of the stars may occasion an accidental
and gradual increase or decay of brightness, not subject to any
regularity in its duration. But when settled periods can be
ascertained, notwithstanding they should be of the most ex-
tended duration, it will not be difficult to find other causes to
explain them, without giving up the rotatory motion.
