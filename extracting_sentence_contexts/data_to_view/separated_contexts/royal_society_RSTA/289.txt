It could be that the depletion of a certain species through one
reaction is compensated for, not by the reverse reaction, but by a separate creation pathway. However, detailed balance asserts that in equilibrium such solutions are not acceptable: all
forward reactions must be balanced by the corresponding reverse reactions. This fact is not at
all evident from a reaction-kinetic formulation. While it will be convenient to work within the
kinetic framework of rate constants, we must always bear in mind the constraints imposed by
equilibrium considerations. We can now use these general results to study a few relevant examples, where we now
explicitly treat multi-step reactions.
