This motion could introduce a systematic error into the analysis, though a
recent study suggested that this globally averaged error should be less than 0.6 mm per year [71],
which is also an independently estimated altimetric trend error [72]. However, the tide gauge
comparison (which remains independent of altimeter processing streams) remains a crucial check
that significantly larger erroneous trends are not present in the altimeter data. These figures are
for global mean sea-level trend, which benefits from the fact that many regional sources of error,
including orbit error, tend to cancel significantly in the global ocean average. Regional trend errors
may be significantly larger at several millimetres per year [73]. The reference system is also vital to understanding sea-level change.
