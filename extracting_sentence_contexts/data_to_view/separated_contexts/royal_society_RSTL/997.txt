After two hours the water in the negative tube produced
no effect upon turmeric paper ; it did produce an effect upon
litmus, which it required great minuteness of observation to
perceive; but it wholly lost the power by being heated
strongly for two or three minutes, 80 there is every reason
for supposing that it was owing to a small quantity of
ammonia. I made a similar experiment with a portion of the same
water in the tubes of agate that had been $0 often used, and


chemical Agencies of Electricity. 9

I had the pleasure of finding | the‚Äù results precisely the
same. To detail any more operations of this kind will be unne-
cessary ; all the facts prove that the fixed alkali is not gene-
rated, but evolved, either from the solid materials employed,
or from saline matter in the water. I have made many experiments in vessels composed of
different substances, with the water procured by very slow
distillation : and in almost every instance some fixed alkali
appeared. In tubes of wax the alkaline matter was a mixture of soda
and potash; and the acid matter a mixture of sulphuric,
muriatic, and nitric acids.
