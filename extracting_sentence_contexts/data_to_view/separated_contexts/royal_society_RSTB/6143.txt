Plate 1, the plexus over the anlage of the optic lobes can be seen to be concentrating
into a vessel running up towards the dorsal surface of the mid-brain. In a thirty-

Plate 2, due in part to the fact that the injection mass has not lodged in the finer
meshes of the fore- and mid-brain plexus. This vessel is the bigeminal artery. As
in Miss SaBrnâ€™s twenty-nine somite embryo, the plexus growing back over the hind-
brain has anastomosed with the first five intersomitic arteries.
