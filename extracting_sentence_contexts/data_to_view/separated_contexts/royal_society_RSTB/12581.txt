PMs), and a trailing/rostral aggregate also including
cells expressing Cxcr7 (i.e. dPMs, pes). (a-d) If the initial gap between
the two fragments is large enough (= 2d,) to inhibit adhesive interactions
between individuals belonging to different clusters, the leading portion stops
locomotion and stretches (having only Cxcr4), while the trailing one preserves
its directional movement (having both SDF1a receptors). Once the two frag-
ments are close enough, they rejoin via adhesive interactions and primordium
normal migration is restored. (e,f) In the absence of the trailing fragment,
the leading cluster still arrests and stretches. (g,h) If the initial gap between
the two fragments is too small (~d,), the normal locomotion of the
primordium is preserved. (Online version in colour.)

interactions between elements belonging to the different frag-
ments. As shown in figure 6a-d, the leading cluster
immediately stops locomotion and stretches, elongating in
both directions along the stripe of SDF la: all its component
individuals (both at the front and at the rear area) in fact
express the migratory protein Cxcr4 and therefore try to
extend towards the chemical stripe, resulting in a net null dis-
placement. The trailing aggregate conversely preserves its
chemical-induced migration. Only the particles at its front
area in fact express Cxcr4, while its mature rosette is
formed by pE agents, which instead have the non-migratory
SDFla-receptor Cxcr7: such a receptor polarization allows the
movement of the overall fragment.
