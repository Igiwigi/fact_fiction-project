Note that in this classical context, and by virtue of (1.7), one has
on dQ 0;,P" = d;p".

(ii) Next we decompose P” into two functions P} and P?, with overlapping supports, where
the support of P} is near the boundary of 2, and the support of P? is a compact subset in
the interior of 2.

(iii) Representing P” in V3 9, in terms of the global geodesic coordinates near the boundary,
we then establish a ‘trace’ theorem in which we prove the ‘uniform continuity’ with
respect to s€ [0,6], ie. up to the boundary, of the function d;P"(s,-) with values in
H-?(R/(LZ)). Consequently, we accomplish the estimate

IP" Ico) < MPH lcoa(ay + IP! Neve ay < CMU? @ 07)|Icoa¢q) + DIIP"IIL~(2), (3-7)

with positive constants C and D that are independent of n and which depend only on 2
and a.
(iv) Taking advantage of the fact that the constants C and D in (3.7) are independent of n, we
can show that
IIP"||L(@)
Iu? ® u)||coa¢ay

remains bounded for small values of 7. This allows us to replace the constant D in (3.7)
by zero on the expense of a larger constant C. Eventually, insisting on the fact that the
constant C in (3.7) depends only on a and @ and that D=0, one can let n > 0, which
allows us to complete the proof.

(a) Adequate regularization of the velocity field
The regularization process is based on the following (classical):
