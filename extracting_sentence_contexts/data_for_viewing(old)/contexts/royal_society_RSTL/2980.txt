it. This opinion was also maintained by Dzcnuares and PorTeRFIELD. That it is
erroneous, I have given, I think, sufficient proof, in showing that, when the optic axes
converge to any point, objects before or beyond the plane of the horopter are under
certain circumstances equally seen single as those in that plane.

Dr. WeLLs's © new theory of visible direction” was a modification of the preceding
hypothesis. This acute writer held with AGviLon1us, that objects are seen single only
when they are in the plane of the horopter, and consequently that they appear double
when they are either before or beyond it ; but he attempted to make this single ap-
pearance of objects only in the plane of the horopter to depend on other principles,
from which he deduced, contrary to AGuiLon1Us, that the objects which are doubled
do not appear in the plane of the horopter, but in other places which are determined
by these principles. Dr. WeLLs was led to his new theory by a fact which he acci-
dentally observed, and which he could not reconcile with any existing theory of
visible direction ; this fact had, though he was unaware of it, been previously noticed
by Dr. Sura ; it is already mentioned in \ 8., and is the only instance of binocular
vision of relief which I have found recorded previous to my own investigations. $0
little does Dr. WELLs's theory appear to have been understood, that no subsequent
writer has attempted either to confirm or disprove his opinions. It would be useless
here to discuss the principles of this theory, which was framed to account for an ano-
malous individual fact, since it is inconsistent with the general rules on which that
fact has been now shown to depend. Notwithstanding these erroneous views, the
* es8ay upon single vision with two eyes” contains many valuable experiments and
remarks, the truth of which are independent of the theory they were intended to
illustrate.
