This is best conceived of by looking at this ring in the Hare or the Rabbit. There we see the single incisive foramen bounded in the middle line in front by the
mesial-palatine processes of the intermaxillaries, while extending backwards from them
is the hemal arch formed by intermaxillaries and maxillaries exactly as in other classes,
except that it is complete. The fact that in certain mammals the intermaxillaries limit the anterior extremity of
the septal cartilage as much as they do in birds and lizards, embracing it at a point
morphologically anterior to the nostrils, appears to me to prove that this is the true
explanation of the facial sclerotome in the mammalia, and that the nostrils throughout

the vertebrata are intersegmental openings lying between the two most anterior segments
of the skull.

© © If thexe conelusions are correct, the connexion of the nasals with the intermaxillaries

and maxillaries behind the nostrils, although s0 constant, is of altogether secondary
morphological importance. But it is undeniable that by the great extent of this con-
nexion in mammals, and by the non-development, in most of them, of any part of the
intermaxillaries above the septal cartilage, and the separation of the nasals from the
intermaxillaries in the middle line, where in birds and lizards they come in contact,
there is a marked attempt, 8 to speak, on the part of Nature to convert the nasals, inter-
maxillaries, and maxillaries of the mammal into a neural arch behind the nostrils. This
tendency reaches its maximum in the human skull, in which the hemal ring of the
facial sclerotome has almost, if not altogether, disappeared, and the whole bulk of the
elements of the hemal arch may be said to be deyoted to the formation of what we may

Q call the psendo-arch behind the nostrils.
