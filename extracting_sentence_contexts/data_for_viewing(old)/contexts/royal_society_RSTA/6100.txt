Figure 11. (a) v, when the bulk incident wave is incident at angles shown in figure 10a. (b) Dependence on the angle of
incidence for v, when the incident wave frequency w takes difference values in the surface wave band. x = 1. In (a), the
grey shade becomes lighter for angles 1-5 while it becomes lighter still for 5â€”1.

crack emits a surface wave vis-a-vis a horizontal crack (which does not even permit a surface
wave). In the continuum limit, the surface wave loses its localized form, in agreement with the
known fact that the surface wave does not exist in the continuum model. In other words, the
particular scattering problem studied has no direct analogue in its natural continuous counterpart
and can be effectively construed as a high frequency effect.
