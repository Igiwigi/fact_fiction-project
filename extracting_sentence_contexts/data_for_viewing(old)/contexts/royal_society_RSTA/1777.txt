contribute to the low-carbon energy system of the future, fusion technologies will have to avoid
the curse that befell nuclear fission—a technology whose initial promise vastly outstripped its
eventual contribution.

Despite decades of research on public attitudes to nuclear fission, in our view, the industry
has never grappled seriously with its salience. As a result, strategies employed to defuse
public opposition have, for the most part, proved utterly futile. One ineffective strategy
involves emphasizing actuarial risk levels, with the hope that better understanding will generate
greater support for the technology [36,37]. Another cluster of strategies collectively comprise a
manifestation of the ‘engineer’s myth’ that a new design is accident-proof or sabotage-proof
[38]. The implicit message of these often well-intentioned strategies is that public anxiety is
unfounded and, if the strategy is executed by experts who are perceived as arrogant or dismissive,
public opposition may harden regardless of the facts [39]. For a review of the literature on public
perception of nuclear power, and for a summary of these strategies, please consult [40].

The lesson for fusion technologies is that the development of super-safe reactors is necessary
but not sufficient to gain the level of public acceptance required for mass deployment, since mass


deployment depends on how the public processes risk information and not just on actual risk
levels [40].

While all new energy systems must contend with this challenge, fusion technologies must
pay particular attention to it. One reason is inherent to the technology, much like it is to nuclear
fission, and that is the small potential for radioactive releases to the environment or material
