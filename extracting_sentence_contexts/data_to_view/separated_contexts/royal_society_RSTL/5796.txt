Some of these ridges are stated to pass from the $80-called hearts to the
genitalia; and the whole apparatus is regarded as forming a portion of the circulatory
organs. 1t is chiefly on the points thus raised by Professor HuxLEY and myself, respecting the
vascular and alimentary systems, that there is a difference of opinion, —Professor Owrn
maintaining the generally received belief in the existence of an anal aperture situated
in the pallial chamber in the Terebratulide, as well as in Lingula; and that the 80-
called hearts are true vascular centres propelling the blood through arteries to the
various Organs. Such being the case, a thorough investigation of the facts had become necessary. I
have therefore applied myself most diligently and earnestly to the subject, fully im-
pressed with a sense of the weight of authority opposed to the views I entertain in
common with Professor HUxLEy, and with the most anxious desire to establish the truth,
as it is of some importance that the anatomy and physiology of these, apparently, much
misunderstood animals should be accurately determined. In a short communication which T made to the Meeting of the Britisgh Association
held at Cheltenham last year', the results up to that time were specified, as far as they
related to the matters in dispute.
