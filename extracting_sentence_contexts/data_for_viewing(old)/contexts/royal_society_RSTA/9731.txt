some parts. but two-phase in others near the outside of the ingot. As the grain size
was rather variable, this alloy was given a further anneal of 4 days at 400°, after
which it was still just two-phase at the outside for a depth of about 0-4 mm. in a
specimen of width 6 mm. This suggested slight inverse segregation in the original
casting and the annealed sample was, therefore, filed so as to remove the outer layer,
and the inner portion was analysed so as to give the composition of the alloy which was
homogeneous at 390°. After a further anneal at 308° this alloy was two-phase
throughout the whole of its cross-section.

The experimental results are plotted in fig. 19, and it will be seen that the maximum
solid solubility is slightly less than that of the typical trivalent systems copper-aluminium,
silver-aluminium, copper-gallium, and silver-indium. This difference is probably due
chiefly to the fact that the atomic diameter of gallium lies just outside the zone of favour-
able size-factor for silver.

Copper-zine.

Previous Work—The previous work on copper-zine alloys is very extensive and has
been exhaustively reviewed by Baver and Hansen.{ The solidus alone does not.
seem to have been determined conclusively, and we have therefore determined a few
points by the quenching method in order to make sure of the position of this line.

Materials used.—The alloys used were kindly presented by the British Non-Ferrous
Metals Research Association, and were in the form of cast strip ingots made from the
purest metals. The authors must express their thanks to Dr. 0. F. Hupson for his
