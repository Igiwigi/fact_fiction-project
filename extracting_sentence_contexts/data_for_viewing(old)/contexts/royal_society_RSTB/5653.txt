B.—Mechanism of the Reaction between Iodine and Kojie Acid.

In considering the mechanism of the reaction between alkaline iodine solution and
kojic acid it is well to bear in mind the fact that alkaline iodine solution can exercise
a double function. On the one hand, it may act as an alkaline hydrolytic agent, and,
on the other, it may act as an oxidising agent. Hence the final products of the reaction
between alkaline iodine and kojic acid, i.e., formic, glycollic, and oxalic acids, may
possibly arise as a result either of hydrolysis, or of oxidation, or of a combination of
the two processes. Iodoform must, of course, arise by a process of substitution from
some intermediate compound.

Let us consider these actions of hydrolysis and oxidation separately.

(1) Hydrolysis—No information is available as to the products of hydrolysis of
kojic acid by means of sodium hydroxide, but a close analogy may be found in the action
of barium hydroxide on the dimethyl ether of kojic acid. Yapura (1916) investigated
