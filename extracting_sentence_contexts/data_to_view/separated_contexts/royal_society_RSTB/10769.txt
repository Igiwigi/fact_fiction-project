A recent study from Rivas et al. chal-
lenged the notion of structure conservation in IncRNAs using
rigorous statistical tests where phylogenetic effect on the covar-
iation is removed [59]. Analysis of the A-repeat region did not
yield statistically significant covariation support for any of the
fixed A-repeat structure models previously proposed. In fact,
the pattern of covariation indicates a large number of possible
pairings, consistent with the stochastic formation of alternative

structures detected by PARIS, which distributes and dilutes
the evolutionary pressure. Taken together, the PARIS,
icSHAPE and covariation analysis all support the stochastic
inter-repeat duplex model for A-repeat, making it the
best-understood region in the entire Xist transcript.

(d) Model of the SPENâ€”A-repeat complex

Recent proteomic and genetic screens have unanimously ident-
ified SPEN as an essential bridge between the A-repeat and
histone deacetylases [11-15]. To further determine the mech-
anism of interaction between the A-repeat region and the
SPEN protein, Lu et al. [10] performed in vitro individual
nucleotide-resolution (i) CLIP to identify the SPEN-binding
sites.
