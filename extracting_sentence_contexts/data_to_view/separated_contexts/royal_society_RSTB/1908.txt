The oogonium next increases greatly in size, and its cytoplasm is granular and
betrays clearly a foam structure in well-fixed material. The nucleus is of a large
size. As the division of the nucleus draws near, the cytoplasm undergoes a change
which in plants that have been preserved with any preparation containing osmic acid
is very marked owing to the fact that the acid is very slightly or not at all reduced
at this stage. Thus the oogonia in this condition are easily distinguished from the
rest, even under a magnifying power far too low to admit of structural details being
discerned at all. This fact is of interest, indicating as it does that special metabolic
processes are going on within the cytoplasm, and that they are associated with
karyokinetie activity.
