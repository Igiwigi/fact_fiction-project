The aconitine and japaconitine of Dr. WrIGaT have
practically the same absorption spectrum and yield similar curves, bub that of
Japaconitine is jus what we might expect from a body with a nucleus of a similar
constitution but twice the molecular weight of aconitine, namely, a much greater
absorptive power. Tt has been shown that japaconitine has snch a difference, for it is
ain fact a 8esqui-apo-aconitine.*
S The English aconitine of Messrs. T. and: H. SmrTH and Co. appears to be a modified
form of japaconitine, and it is possible that the modification of the spectrum curve is
1 part due to an admixture of another body.
