Viewed in the light of our subsequent investigations, however, the explanation is
perfectly simple. ‘The larvee of the European eel which are found at Bermuda and in
the western Atlantic generally are, owing to the vicinity of the breeding-grounds, all
young, belonging to the O- and I-groups, and consequently as yet far from that stage
of development at which they seek the shores. It is only larvee of the American eel
which are found so far west in the full-grown and metamorphosic stages, at which
they are drawn to the coasts. Consequently, Anguilla rostrata is the only one of the
two species which “lands” at Bermuda, the hosts of larvee of Anguilla vulgaris which
surround these islands being only passers-by on their way to a far more distant goal.

As we have learned, the breeding-grounds both of the European and of the
American eel lie west of long. 50° W. Although the larvee of Anguilla rostrata
become far more numerous in proportion from east to west, it is nevertheless a fact
that there are extensive areas where the larvee of the two species are greatly inter-
mingled, The “Dana” stations provide many examples of such intermingling, as
shown in the photograph (Plate 18) and the graph fig. 9.

It is very natural then to ask: If the larvee of the two species are found greatly
intermingled in certain areas of the ocean, how is it that the stock of eels in Europe
is, practically speaking, pure, ¢.e., composed exclusively of Anguilla vulgaris, and that
in America of Anguilla rostrata? The question may also be formulated as follows :—
How do the masses of larvze in the western Atlantic sort themselves out, so that
those individuals which belong to Anguilla vulgaris ultimately find themselves in
Europe, while those of Anguilla rostrata “land” on the shores of America and the
West Indies ?
