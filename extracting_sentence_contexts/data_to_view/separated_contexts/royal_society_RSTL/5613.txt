In the tube Z, the cylindrical form was better maintained by
= the butt-joint, and this difference, apparently s0 small, had a serious effect upon the
F Tisting powers of the tube. According to the results in the Table, there was a loss of
S' More than one-third of the strength in the tube with the lap-joint, the ratio being
= 89-3:100, or 7:10 nearly. These facts are conclusive in showing the necessity of

= adbering in these constructions to the true cylindrical form. Z The foregoing experiments were instituted for the purpose of ascertaining the resist-
8 ance of tubes to collapse, when the ends were securely fixed to unyielding discs (as is the
S Â©se with the flues of a boiler), and rigidly kept apart to prevent their approaching one
& mother. Tn this position, the tubes, when submitted to severe collapsing pressures, were
to 80me extent in a state of tension, and in some few cases, when collapse took place.
