They antagonize the levatores costarum. |

A muscle (21) arises from the upper edge of the rib just above the insertion of the |
depressor of the rib, this passes obliquely upwards and outwards in front of one rib, |
to be inserted into the lower edge of the second rib above, near to its free end. This
is shorter when the lung is flaccid than when it is distended, and is in fact a con-
tinuation of the depressor of the rib, the rib being interposed ; it represents the internal :
intercostal. A transversalis muscle (20) forms a musculo-tendinous web over the whole belly ;
it is attached to the inner surface of the rib where the depressor costze is inserted,
and acts with the depressor costze to narrow the area between the opposed ribs. There are cutaneous musecles that assist in expiration in front of the transversalis,
which are connected with the ribs externally.
