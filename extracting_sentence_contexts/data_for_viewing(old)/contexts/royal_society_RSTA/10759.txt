spheres upon Planets and Satellites” was published by Dr. JoHNSTONE STONEY. t

The latter paper, however, does not in any way anticipate the methods that I
had contemplated using, and there are so many points on which further investigation
appeared desirable that a continuation of the present work seemed to me fully justified.

Since the present investigation was completed, I have seen Mr. 8. R. Coox’s paper,t
the method of which is closely analogous with that adopted in the calculations of my
Nottingham paper.

2. Warerston’s Method.

Warerston’s investigations take no account of the fact that the molecular
speeds of the molecules of the gas are distributed about a mean, according to such
an arrangement as the Borrzmann-MAXxweELt distribution. Hence in dealing with
planetary atmospheres it is assumed that at any point all the molecules are moving
with the same speed. On such an assumption the conditions for the existence of an
atmosphere are very simple, especially if no account is taken of axial rotation.
For supposing the celestial body under consideration to be a sphere of radius @, and
that the acceleration of its attraction at distance 1 is p/r*, then v being the transla-
tional speed of a molecule at the surface of the body, it is evident that if
