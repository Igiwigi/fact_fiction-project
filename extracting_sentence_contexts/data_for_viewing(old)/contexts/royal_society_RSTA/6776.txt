11. THE PROPAGATION OF WAVES IN A BAR OF INFINITE LENGTH ACCORDING
TO THE EXACT EQUATIONS OF PocHHAMMER AND CHREE

Considering a cylindrical bar of radius a, let the axis of the bar be taken as the axis of x

and let r denote distances measured at right angles to Ox. Let c be the velocity of propagation
a of extensional sinusoidal waves of wave-length A and period T in the bar.
q The main differences between the elementary theory and the exact general theory of
8 Pochhammer and Chree are as follows: (1) According to the simple theory, the velocity of
a sinusoidal wave is independent of A and is equal to cy, (= ,/(E/p)) ; according to the general
a.theory, ¢ is determined by a, A, cy and o, where @ is Poisson’s ratio, and, in fact, (¢/cg) is a
ic function of ¢ and (a/A), which is unity only in the limit when a/A is zero. Dispersion will
© therefore occur in the general case, and if an arbitrary disturbance, originating at x = 0,
& say, is resolved into its Fourier components, the relative phases of these components vary
with the distance from the origin and the disturbance suffers distortion as it travels along the
gq By Dar (2) According to the simple theory, the longitudinal stress and displacement are
= uniform over the cross-section of the bar, the radial stress is everywhere zero and the radial

@ displacement at distance r from the axis is gr/E. In the general case, the longitudinal stress
s and displacement vary over the cross-section of the bar, the radial stress is finite and the

radial displacement does not follow the simple linear law.
2 The discussion which follows deals with the effects of these differences on the response of
