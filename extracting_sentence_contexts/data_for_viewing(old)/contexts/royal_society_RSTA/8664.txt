(v.) As the converse of (XIX.) it may be noted that—

(XXL) A quantity of the conjugate set, or a l.c. of such quantities, cannot be
improved by means of the non-corresponding quantities of the original set ; e.g.,
a Le. of ¢; and o, cannot be improved by using the 0's, other than 4, and 4, as
auxiliaries. This follows from (IX.) of §6, since the m.p.e. of 6, and o, is 0
unless 7 = s.

(vi.) If, as in § 5, there are related conjugate sets of w’s and y’s, and the d's are the
differences of the w’s, it follows from § 5 (v.) that (=) in (ii.) above is a le. of the
moments of the y's up to the j. (XIX.) is therefore a generalisation of the
theorem, for a self-conjugate set, that the improved values are l.cc. of the moments ;
and, in fact, it explains the appearance of the moments in this connexion,

9. Mean Products of Error of Improved Values.—(i.) We have found, in § 8 (iv.),
that

(ex); = (Non); Fo+ (Aa adj ort eee + Ajay

To obtain the \’s, we introduce the condition that this shall differ from d, by a Le.
of o's after 4,.
