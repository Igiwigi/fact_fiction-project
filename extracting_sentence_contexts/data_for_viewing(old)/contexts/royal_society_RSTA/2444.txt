In addition to the uncertainty in confinement scaling at low aspect ratio there is also
uncertainty in how any scaling differences at low aspect ratio transition or connect to higher
aspect ratio. Any such transitions /connections between low and higher aspect ratio confinement
could have important implications for the ultimate choice of aspect ratio for compact pilot plants.
To assess this in a highly approximate way, a hybrid ‘NSTX-Petty08’ scaling is used. This ad
hoc hybrid scaling accounts for the fact that the NSTX ST scaling has thus far been developed
for plasmas with A < 1.7 (€ > 0.6). Similarly, the Petty08 scaling has been developed using data
primarily from conventional aspect ratio plasmas with A> 2.5 (« <0.4). Assuming a linear
interpolation in € between the two scalings is justified, a combined /hybrid scaling can be defined
as the weighted sum of the NSTX and Petty08 scalings according to: tg = tg-Nsrx for € > €; = 0.6,
TE = TE-Pettyos for € <€2=0.4 and te = (€ — €2)/(€1 — €2)tE-NSTX + (€1 — €)/(€1 — €2)TE-Pettyos for
€)<€<«&.

Figure 7a shows that in order to reach the Br values shown in figure 6b elevated normalized
confinement is required for all aspect ratios. In particular, the required H-factor relative to the
ITER 98y2 scaling is as high as 1.7-1.8 at lower A and is 1.5-1.6 for high A =3-4. Similarly,
figure 7b shows that even for the Petty08 confinement scaling with weak 6 dependence, the
H-factor relative to the scaling is between 1.2 and 1.4 for nearly all aspect ratios and is nearly
