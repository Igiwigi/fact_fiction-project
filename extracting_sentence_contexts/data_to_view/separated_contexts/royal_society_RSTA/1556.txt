The neural system involving numerous complex vital functions can be viewed also as a
network that can be represented with nodes (neurons) and links (synapses). Recent findings from
neuroimaging studies have provided strong evidence that neuron populations exhibit complex
topologies at all scales and that neuronal functions are not solely attributable to biological
and chemical processes, but also to neuronal connectivity. Considering this fact, recent SR and


VR studies in neural systems have focused on the impacts of topological features of neural
networks on successful detection and transmission of weak signals. In this context, complex
network models derived from graph theoretical analysis of neuroimaging data provide a useful
environment for the computational study of these two resonance phenomena. In this review, a coalescence of recent intriguing SR and VR studies in neuronal media is
presented.
