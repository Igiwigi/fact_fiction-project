straight line, and its change to B is very abrupt. BC is again practically straight
until the vicinity of C is reached, and C is not a peak, but a protuberance. The
curve becomes practically straight again after C. The point B ceases to be a peak
if q is rather less than 5, and begins to resemble C.

Perhaps the main points of interest about the curve are, next to its approximation
to that for H,, the straightness of its branches and the smallness of the protuberances,
But, in spite of their smallness, the method already described of using paper printed
ina pattern of fine dots enables them to be detected readily by pricking out the
final dot which is visible on the enlarged photograph. The distance between the
protuberances on either side of the axis, divided by the magnification, gives at once
twice the separation of the components from the central line on the original plate,
and allows at the same time for the fact that the prismatic spectrum isnot normal.

It is to be noted that the ratios of the slopes of the nearly straight branches of the
curve differ little from those of the values of g belonging to the components, when
these values decrease so rapidly that the peaks become mere protuberances.

Since the head of a protuberance on the curve lies necessarily on the axis of the
component giving rise to it, the particular constant intensity which defines the
contour is immaterial. If, therefore, a set of contours of various constant intensities
are chosen on the plate, the heads of the various protuberances, one on each contour,
due to any component, lie on a straight line parallel to the axis of the contours, or
perpendicular to the base of the photograph. Protuberances of very small size can
in this way be detected as such, without the risk of including slight irregularities
