The case when G becomes
zero by virtue of J=( and L=0, that is to say when the function is reducible by real
or imaginary linear substitutions (see footnote (®) (f)) to the form u(u*+v"), is the
one which might for a moment be supposed to offer an exception to the rule; but only
the exception is only apparent, since u(u*—o*), on writing u=p+9q, v=p—g, becomes
16(p+g)paAr+8&).

(47) To every point in space, it has been remarked, will correspond one particular
family of equations all of the same character as regards the number they contain of
real or imaginary roots, because capable of being derived from one another by real
linear substitutions, such family consisting of an infinite number of ordinary or con-
Jugate equations according as the point is facultative or non-facultative ; but it may be
well to notice that, conversely, every point does not correspond to a distinct family. In
fact every point in the curyes D=p9J?, L=9J* (p, q being constants) will denote a curve
divided into two branches by the origin of coordinates, one of which will be facultative
and the other non-facultative ; but in each separate branch every point will represent
the very same family. Any such separate branch may be termed an isomorphic line;
and we see that the whole of space may be conceived as permeated by and made up of
such lines radiating out from the origin in all directions. (48)
