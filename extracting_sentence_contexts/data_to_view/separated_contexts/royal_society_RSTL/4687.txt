Though experimentally alizarine is formed in the
smallest proportion, it is nevertheless theoretically possible to convert rubian entirely
into alizarine, without the least quantity of the other substances being produced. From this point of view the other substances may be considered as formed at the ex-
pense of alizarine. In fact, by adding together 1 equiv. of verantine and 1 equiv. of
rubiretine, and subtracting 1 equiv. of water, we obtain the elements of 2 equivs. of
alizarine, for
C,, H, O;+C,, H; O,=2(C,, H, O,)+ HO. Also by adding together 1 equiv. of rubianine and 1 equiv. of s1gar, and subtract-

ing 16 equivs. of water, we obtain the elements of 4 equivs. of alizarine, for
C,, Hz, OÂ»y+C:z His Oj2=4(Cy H; Oy) +16HO. If any chemist should succeed in changing rubian entirely into alizarine, an under-

taking in which there is no occasion to despair of success, he would be the means of

giving a great stimulus to many branches of manufacture and adding a large sum to
the national wealth,
