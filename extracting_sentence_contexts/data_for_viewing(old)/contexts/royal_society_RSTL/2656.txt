the presumed elasticity of the air-sacs, or the sliding of the segments one over the
other, may be the means of effecting it*#. But neither-of these actions could alone
induce a current, or Suecession -of currents of air to be sent over the whole body,

through the ramifying and anastomosing trachez, sufficient for the purposes of re-
spiration, which is probably the result of several combined actions. The experi-
mental fact observed by Reaumus, that the anterior pair of spiracles is the most im-
portant to the insect, connected with that of the gradual obliteration of the last two
pairs during the changes to the perfect state, and the great extent to which the an-
terior spiracles are developed as the insect approaches that condition, lead us to con-
clude at once that it is chiefly through the anterior spiracles that respiration is per-
formed. The action of the retractores spiracula muscles necessarily tends to contract,
the segments and close the spiracles, and thus, as it were, pump on the air through
the longitudinal trachez towards the anterior or thoracic ones; while the relaxation
of these muscles, and of the other oblique and longitudinal ones in each abdominal
segment during the time the muscles of the thorax are in action, must naturally tend
to enlarge the capacity of the body and induce an act of inspiration. Indeed we have
full proof that respiration is performed by the alternate contraction and relaxation of
the abdominal muscles in what takes place in Orthopterous, Hemipterous, and many
