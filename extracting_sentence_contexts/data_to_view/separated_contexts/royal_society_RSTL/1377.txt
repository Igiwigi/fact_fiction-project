Having thus examined all the circumstances
which I proposed respecting the emptying of vessels, I proceed
next to the consideration of the doctrine of the resistance of
bodies moving in fluids. When a body moves in a fluid, each particle, in theory, is
supposed to act upon it undisturbed by the rest, or the fluid is
conceived to act as if each particle, after the stroke, were anni-
hilated, in which case the following particles would exert their
force uninterruptedly. This supposition is very far from be-
ing true in fact, and accordingly we find very little agreement
between theory and experiment. To experiments therefore
we must have recourse for any thing satisfactory upon this
subject. I therefore constructed the machine which is here de-
scribed, whereby both the absolute quantity of resistance in
all cases may be very.
