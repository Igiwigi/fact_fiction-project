Western
society has been rocked by a series of crises, from financial
collapse through global warming to youth unemployment. Para-
doxically, most of these crises are unanticipated consequences of
the very innovation cascades that are central to the Innovation
Society ideology’s prescription for social transformation. The
ideology assumes that innovations (that is, new artefacts) solve
social problems—it ignores the fact that every such ‘solution’
has the potential to generate many new problems! This cycle of
problems-solutions—problems is endogenous to Innovation
Society dynamics, which provide no means for collectively
determining the direction of social change or for reacting to nega-
tive social consequences of the integration of new artefacts into
patterns of social interaction, except... more new artefacts to
deal with these consequences once detected, artefacts that
must prove their value in the marketplace. It is becoming increasingly obvious that, despite its unde-
niable creativity in generating novelty, the market is not
quick in detecting the negative consequences of innovation
cascades, nor is it efficient in responding to them when it
does detect them.
