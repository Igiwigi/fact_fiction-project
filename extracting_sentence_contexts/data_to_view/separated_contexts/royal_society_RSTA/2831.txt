The overall positive carbonate-associated sulfur-isotope
excursion may be attributed to increased global pyrite fixation associated with the significant burial of organic matter that
characterized OAE 1a, commonly developed in Segments (3 to C5 in European sections [50]. However, if the two values that
interrupt the positive excursion are not diagenetic artefacts, they may record reoxygenation of the oceans in response to global
cooling and preferred liberation of the lighter isotope of sulfur (5) from oxidation of pyrite and S-rich organic matter. The
fact that the relatively low sulfur-isotope values fall within the C4 Segment, known to record global cooling (figures 3, 6-8), is
compatible with this palaeoclimatological interpretation, and the stratigraphic relationship with the lowest Li-isotope values
of the OAE 1a interval indicates significant silicate weathering, which would act as a sink for carbon dioxide. The negative sulfur-
isotope excursion over the higher part of the Q2 interval, which could also be registering a cooling and oxygenation event, does
not obviously match any other well-documented records. Cyclostratigraphic estimates for the durations of the C-Segments are
based on Italian data [41].
