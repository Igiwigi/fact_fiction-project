F.R.S. Read March 1, 1794. Tr is a matter of great curiosity to observe, after any fact has
been well ascertained, how many things might have led to a
much earlier investigation ; particularly so, had the writings
of many great men been equally examined, with those obser-
vations which, though apparently very trifling, have often ex-
cited general attention. The conversion of animal muscle into
a fatty matter gives us a very striking example. The celebrated Sir Tomas Brown, in his very learned and
Â© curious treatise intituled Hydriotaphia, assures us, that he has
found a soap-like substance in an hydropical body.
