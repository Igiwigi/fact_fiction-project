chloric acid contained in the liquid electrolyte does not diminish below a certain amount.
The compoxition of the absorbed gaseous mixture varies with every change of tempera-
ture, whereas the compoxition of the free gas remains the same for all temperatures, pro-
vided that the statical equilibrium is not disturbed by alteration of the temperature and
pressure during the evolution of the gas.

After the statical equilibrium has been established, the gas invariably contains one
volume of chlorine to one of hydrogen. This important fact, which is strictly conform-
able to the laws of gas absorption, is deduced from the following analyses made with
electrolytic chlorine and hydrogen evolyed both from carbon and platinum poles of dif-
ferent dimensions, by currents of various degrees of intensity. In order accurately to
Heaure the volume of gas required for analysis, we allowed the dried electrolytic gas to

through the glass cylinders represented in Plate XVII. fig. 1. These cylinders, of
Sie same diameter, but of yarious lengths, are closed by surfaces of plate glass presed
pon the ground ends of the cylinders by means of the screws aaa, and the joint
Endered perfectly air-tight by a thin roll of white wax squeezed flat between the two
Wrfaces of glass. Each cylinder is furnished with a delivery- and exit-tube ground into
Ge glass, and firmly fastened by cements of gutta-percha and gypsum. The gases passed
Arough the cylinders until the whole of the atmospheric air was displaced; and after
