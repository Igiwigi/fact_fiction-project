content and absence of green blotches, did not suggest Keuper marl. In the fourth hole
at 800 ft., a thin layer of similar material intervened between sand and normal Keuper
marl. It therefore becomes necessary to postulate a small pocket of drift clay older than
the Baginton sands. A larger pocket of these older clays occurs between 3800 and 5200 ft.
on the section. In the hole at 5030 ft., red plastic clay containing scattered pebbles of
Bunter quartz and quartzite cannot be confused with the green mottled Keuper marl upon
which it rests. The three holes from 3940 to 4250 ft. all show stoneless plastic clay, which in
the lowest is visibly laminated in the manner of varved clay and so clearly distinguishable
from Keuper marl. The significance of these oldest drifts will be discussed later. Since
future work might make such a term as ‘oldest’ misplaced, these deposits will be called the
Bubbenhall clay.

Two other facts proved by the augered sections are worthy of mention. The hill slopes
are usually covered by a layer of orange loamy gravel varying in its proportions of clay,
sand and pebbles, typically 2 to 3 ft. thick, and clearly post-dating the present valley
topography. It is interpreted as the result of solifluxion, probably during the cold period
represented by No. 2 river terrace or the end stage of No. 4 terrace. From a mapping point
of view it can be a great nuisance by obscuring the outcrops of the layers in the older
drifis—it is even now impossible to detect the Wolston sand at the surface across Brick
Kiln Field (section S,), though the auger has proved a layer 17 ft. thick to be there.

The other feature common to all sections is some degree of disturbance at the outcrops
of sands or gravels—often a gentle camber, sometimes a buckled edge, and in both cases
ascribed to gravity flow of the contiguous clays. In no case, however, is the effect large
enough to affect mapped boundaries by more than a few feet of height.
