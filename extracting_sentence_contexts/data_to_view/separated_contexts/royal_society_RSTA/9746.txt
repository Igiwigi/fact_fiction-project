It appears, therefore, that, when «(s,¢) is of positive type, the determinant of the
integral equation (7) is either an infinite power series in \ whose coefficients are
alternately positive and negative numbers, or else it is a polynomial whose coefficients
obey the same law. Another property which is worth noticing is that, if L is the upper limit of the
function « (s, s) in the interval (a, b), then

-LSx«(s,t) SL

in the whole of the square Q. This follows immediately from the fact that, since

st
K ‘ =0,

we have

L?= (s,s) x(t, t) =[«(s, t)f.

§12. We have so far confined ourselves to the consideration of functions of positive
type, but the reader will easily perceive that the results obtained for these functions
may be made applicable to those of negative type by a simple device. In fact, if
«(s, t) is of negative type in the square Q, and we suppose that

kK (s, t) = —K (s, t),

it is evident that «’ (s, ¢) is of positive type in Q.
