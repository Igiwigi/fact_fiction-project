The departure from
a straight line in the primary pulse HH is trifling ; in the secondary pulse the tendency
to a concavity with turning point at day » + 28 is more apparent. In the case of JJ,
the concavity is quite prominent in both the primary and secondary pulses, but the
minimum appears on day n + 1. The special features in the primary pulses FF and HH, and to a minor extent in JJ,
arise from the fact that character figures 0-7, 0-6 and 0-5, especially the first two,
occur most often when disturbance is on the down grade. As is suggested by the shape
of the primary pulses AA to CC, the rise to disturbance, especially to outstandingly
large disturbance, is usually more rapid than the decline. The days of characters 0-7»
0-6 and 0-5, when combined, as in the 7th line of Table II, and in the curve GG of fig.
