1026 DR. W. H. GASKELL ON THE RHYTHM OF THE HEART OF

vagus produces no alteration in the 8ize of the contractions, but only an alteration of
rhythm in accordance with the alteration of rate of the auricular contractions,*

CONCLUSION.

The curves and arguments given in this paper show clearly that the vagus nerye
exercises a powerful influence upon the muscular tissne of the heart as well as upon
the motor ganglia. That it acts upon the muscular tissue is proved by the fact that
its stimulation causes a profound alteration of the force of the muscular contractions,
together with corresponding variations in the excitability and tonicity of the musecle,
without necessarily altering the rate of rhythm.

Its action upon the force of the contractions may be in the direction of diminution or
of augmentation, 80 that the nerve sometimes causes a diminution of the force of the
contractions followed by augmentation, sometimes augmentation alone without any
previous diminution.

This diminution may vary greatly both in extent and duration ; ib may be very
slight or 80 great that the contractions disappear altogether, s0 that in this way complete
quiescence may be cansed ; it may be that the first few beats only after the beginning
