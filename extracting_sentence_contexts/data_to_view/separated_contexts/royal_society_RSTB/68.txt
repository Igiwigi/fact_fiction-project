variation is seen. It doubtless depends on the fact that with the slowness of action
asynchronism of acting parts becomes manifest, but whether we have to do with a

much retarded transmission from part to part along nerves or with muscular conduc-
tion is difficult to say with certainty ; the entire similarity of the wave with a muscular
wave is, however, sufficiently obvious. Finally, when transmission can no longer be
effected, the heart responds to local excitation by a monophasic variation which may
be temporary—indicative of local discharge of action,—or permanent—indicative of
injury of tissue.
