INTRODUCTION AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The investigation of which the results are here recorded was begun at the suggestion of
Dr W. T. Calman. No species had been examined by adequate methods, and no full series
of stages of any single type had previously been seen. The existing descriptions leave many
gaps, they present many doubtful interpretations, and they suggest a diversity of morpho-
genetic processes within the group which does not in fact exist. Further data are required
concerning the initiation and process of metamerism which will facilitate a further analysis
of the morphology and phylogeny of the arthropod head, and recent contributions on
metamerism based largely on segmented invertebrates need both confirmation and critical

examination. With these ends in view the present work has been undertaken.
