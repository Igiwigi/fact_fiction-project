among the fossils described as belonging to the Marattiacew, that in certain cases the
sori appear not to be segregated (Myriotheca), in others they are not clearly defined
(Grand Eurya), while in all the living genera they are commonly isolated on the
under surface of the leaf. But even here they are not always strictly defined, for

they show occasional abstrictions. These facts plainly correspond to those well known
in Leptosporangiate ferns; as in them, so here, it should be recognised that the
circumscribed sorus is only the prevalent, not the exclusive type, while in the
Marattiacece it is the fossils which supply the less definite examples. On the question
of origin of the definite sorus, Srur (loc. cit., p. 792), after remarking that types with
solitary sporangia lived simultaneously with those in which sporangia are united into
true sori, proceeds (p. 793) to state that “ Hapalopteris is move recent than Senften-
bergia,” that is, “the species with solitary sporangia are older than those in which
the sporangia appear gathered in irregular groups.” I do not think that this can be
accepted as a general statement of a morphological progression. It appears to be
based upon observation of two genera only, important and early though they certainly
are. Before it can be considered as established on paleontological grounds alone, the
absence of ferns with clearly defined sori of prior date and of reasonably close affinity
