where a is the crack length, 1 is the strain hardening exponent, T is the effective flow stress of
the material and the other symbols have their usual meaning. In fact, T is frequently regarded
as a fitting parameter. This equation shows, in qualitative agreement with linear elastic fracture
mechanics crack growth correlations, that for a given plastic strain the FCP rate increases with
Ao. On the other hand, for deformation by Orowan looping (figure 7b), there is a plethora of
literature which shows that crack initiation for disbursed slip is more difficult and the initiation
life should be longer. Thus, the mechanical behaviour and corresponding dislocation substructure
indicate very different effects of microstructure on various aspects of fatigue, which means that
alloy design needs to be done with the actual failure criteria in mind. Another interesting example
of the effect of slip mode is found in a recent study in which the reversibility of slip was correlated
with the threshold stress intensity parameter AK, for a Ni-base alloy as a function of temperature
as shown in figure 22 [46]. This correlation demonstrates that AK, increases with increasing slip
reversibility, which clearly is related to the slip mode through the morphology and character of
the y’ precipitates as well as thermal activation, which could produce non-planar deformation
