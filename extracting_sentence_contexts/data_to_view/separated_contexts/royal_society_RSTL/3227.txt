This view, if correct, as I fully believe it to be, shows
by what a slight difference of circumstances, either a remarkable development or an
entire obliteration of the ancient beaches has been determined. The intermediate
shelf clearly owes its existence to the same causes which have in this part so strongly
marked the upper and lower one; and though it is less strongly marked than these
two in this immediate neighbourhood, yet it differs but little from them as they ordi-
narily occur, and is, I think, fully as plain as the lower shelf throughout Glen Spean. I assert, then, that it is an incontestable fact, that water mnst. have remained at the
level of this intermediate shelf for a long period, and only a little less long than at
the other lines; yet in no other part of Glen Roy, the valley where circumstances
have been 80 pre-eminently fayonrable for the formation and preservation of these
beaches, a trace of this intermediate shelf has been observed. It has likewise
been most clearly shown, that barriers could not have existed at the double mouth
of Glen Roy, and we have seen that the surface”of the land has been preserved in that
neighbourhood in a manner quite extraordinary ; yet it is known on the authority of
Sir Lauper Dick, who appears to have examined the whole course of the Spean and
its tributaries with great care, that not a vestige of either of these upper shelves can
be discovered beyond the mouths of Glen Roy. Any argument, therefore, whatever,
from the non-existence of the shelves or beaches bearing on the former limits of the
ocean over this part of Scotland, during the period of rest in the subterranean move-
ments, is valueless.

figures a supernumerary shelf at a point north-west of the houses of Glen Turet, at a level above that of the
upper helf of Glen Roy ; a mound of alluyium, above, and nearly parallel to the shelf, certainly occurs there ;
but from the want of sharpness of outline, I should be unwilling to pronounce that it had formed a line of
beach, although I should be far from feeling any surprise if this could be shown to have been the case.
