Figure 2 also depicts the bit rate-distance product at which optical technologies become cost

and performance competitive compared with electronic link technologies, using 100 Gbs~!m as : =
the metric. Note that distance for this case is the maximum link length and the capacity is Sy
the peak link data rate, which should be distinguished from network capacity and distance in 2
terms of ingress-egress traffic or capacity. However, this gives an indication of the potential for aed
each technology to address the respective applications. We observe that on-chip networks are 22
at the break-even point, although many on-chip connections involve much shorter distances. : 8
Cost, density and energy are key factors preventing the use of photonics at this scale. The : s
cross-over point is at 1-10m distances where optical interconnects begin to replace electronic : s
interconnects on large scales. In fact, many data centres still use electrical connections from the 1B

servers to the ToR switch, although this is beginning to change starting from systems that host
high-performance computing applications.

Several important features are apparent from the network capacity distance scaling shown in
figures 2 and 3. Network capacity is not a monotonically increasing function with distance as
one might expect due to aggregation over distance. Instead, we find that there are distances over
which a large amount of data flows locally forming a peak. We refer to these peaks as information
hubs. Information hubs collect, process and transmit data from constituent sources. The computer
processor is a hub for processor core computations. The data centre is a hub for compute jobs
and the continental network is a hub for Internet communications. We also see an emerging hub
around the metropolitan areaâ€”reflected by the increase of metro-only traffic in recent years.
