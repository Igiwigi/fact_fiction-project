we find it easy to separate this body from the column of motion on the fore part, and
the column of sensation behind. Following then the fibrous portion of matter which
ascends from it, we find that it runs close upon the back of the septum of the pons,
and that a part of it goes off to the corpora quadrigemina, whilst a part runs directly
into the crus cerebri.

On tracing the column which descends from the corpus oliyare, we find that it is
very 800n attached to the columns both of motion and of sensation, and becomes in-
corporated with them as it passes downwards (Plate XXI. 6.).

We have now traced three great tracts or courses of fibres into the crus cerebri ;

* In fact all the columns which form the medulla oblongata converge downwards and are pyramidal. We
have the anterior pyramidal bodies, the posterior pyramidal bodies or corpora restiformia, and those deeper
columns, whose form might authorize the term, as they are more especially counterpacts of the true anterior
pyramidal bodies.

an anterior one for motion, a posterior one for sensation, and a middle one, which for
the present we may call the tract of the corpus olivare.

After these dissections, it is impossible for us to consider the medulla oblongata as
the mere commencement of the spinal marrow : it has a peculiar structure and di-
