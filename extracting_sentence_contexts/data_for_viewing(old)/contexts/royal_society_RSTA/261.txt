But this can, and often does, seriously misrepresent the state of the scientific
evidence, where ‘one team’ is the consensus view of the science community and the
‘other team’ is a tiny minority. For example, consider the debate about whether
HIV causes AIDS. A research community of order 100 000 has by now established
this as a fact. But a small travelling roadshow, including one Nobel Laureate, can
still be assembled to deny it. And there are many other examples: from MMR
vaccination in the UK to the essential reality of anthropogenic climate change
(albeit with remaining uncertainties about the timescales and magnitudes of some
nonlinear processes).

Furthermore, it is often difficult to make an accurate assessment of risks,
and even when an accurate assessment can be made, many people’s subjective
assessment is very different from the objective facts. Such subjective attitudes
can create their own reality and impede effective policy actions.

Even a policy of ‘label and let the consumer choose’ has its problems. For
one thing, there is a question of individual risk versus collective risk (e.g. an
individual may choose the health risk of smoking, but there remain associated
risks of ‘passive smoking’ for family or in public places; other examples abound,
particularly in relation to vaccination policies and herd immunity). For another
thing, there is the question of individuals making bad choices for dependent
people, such as young children.
