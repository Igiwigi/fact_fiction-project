W. HULKE ON POLACANTHUS FOXII.

is now evident that the pieces which I described in my paper of 1881 were not all
integers of the value of separate scutes, entering by overlap, or other arthrodial
articulation, into the composition of the shield, but (with the exception of the y spines)
were pieces originally synostosed in a continuous sheet, in which no traces of suture
or other marks of primitive distinctness are discernible. Near its lateral and posterior border the shield is thicker than at the middle, where
it overlies the vertebral column, a fact noticed by Mr. Fox. The form of these
borders is that of a smoothly-rounded lip separated from the upper surface by a
narrow sunken groove.
