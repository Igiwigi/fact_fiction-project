But a further definition in regard to the limits is required : first, we assume that
m has the corresponding positive and negative values, and similarly that 7 has corre-
sponding positive and negative values* ; or sy, in the four formulz respectively, we
consider m, 1 as extending

m from —p to p+2, n from —v to v+2,

where þ and y are each of them ultimately infinite. But, secondly, it is necessary
that p should be indefinitely larger than », or say that ultimatel = :

and neglecting for the moment mere constant factors, we have

* This is more than is necessary ; it would be enough if the ultimate values of m were —[t, , « and u
being in a ratio of equality; and the like as regards n. But it is convenient that the numbers should be

absolutely equal. AND DOUBLE THETA-FUNCTIONS. 931
