‘coin flip’ between those outcomes (it is not set by the parent
worm). Second, this decision is stochastic at the level of the
fragment, not the individual cells. Thus, what we do not observe
are mosaic, speckled worms in which 70% of the cells want to
make one head and 30% want to make two. Rather, each cell in
the fragment agrees with the group decision to make one head
or two (at a 70-30 frequency at the population level). The bi-
stability here is at the level of the cellular collective. Indeed,
the basic phenomenon of head/tail regeneration reveals that
itis nota local, cell-level decision because the two wounds pro-
duced by bisection of a normal worm have radically different
anatomical outcomes (head from one wound, tail from the
other) despite the fact that the cells were immediately adjacent
neighbours before the cut and thus were at the same positional
information level along the axis. Thus, proper regeneration in
the normal case, as in the modified scenarios described
above, requires cells to communicate across significant dis-
tances to determine what structures exist, and which must be
made anew [62,81,85,86].

This same phenomenon, where bioelectric networks
enable group decisions within a large cell field, has also been
described in left-right patterning (where targeting the decision
by ion channel perturbations induces randomization of entire
left or ride side identities, not individual cells [87]) and in the
