which is proportional to 7~?.
The expression for the height of the waves (mod F) may be written in the form

1 b
mod P= 9 [(kbflog (¥kb +7)? + fn"}) fi () (51)

and the coefficient of ./(b/mr) in this expression is slightly greater than unity when 2 lies
between 0-1 and 0-2A. Thus when b = 4/27 the value of the coefficient is 1-053. Hence for
this range of values of b, the height of the waves is given approximately by /(4/mr). This
may be compared with the approximate formula b/,/(Ay) for the maximum height when
b>A. These two expressions would be equal at r= y if b?/Ay = 6/n7, i.e. b = A/a, which
suggests that the formula b/,/(Ay) for the maximum wave height gives a rough approxi-
mation for values of b down to about A/7. The fact that the maximum height is proportional
to b and not ./b when the gap is not very small means that the energy of the wave motion
passing through the gap is still propagated mainly in the direction of the incident waves.
