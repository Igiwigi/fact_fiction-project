Its capture was occa-
sioned by its being, when first observed, almost worn out by
unavailing efforts to gorge a fish of about seven inches in
circumference, with which it appeared to have been long
contending, as it exhibited very feeble signs of life. Its
organs of motion being extremely small, and its body greatly
elongated, this creature would, on a cursory view, be by all
considered as an extraordinary kind of sea serpentâ€”a tribe
of animals concerning which s0 much equivocal matter has
been written ; and this idea would be eyen supported by a
more close examination of some parts of its structure. The
fact, that the sea contained animals nearly allied in form to


newly discovered genus of serpentiform. fishes. 51

serpents, has been remarked in the earliest ages ; ARISTOTLE
has expressly stated, that there are many species of sea ser-
pents, among which tribe he evidently includes the branchial
apodes, for he has particularized one of these as par excel-
lence the Opis Jakurrios. This is the murana_serpens of
Linnzvs, or the ophisurus of LACEPEDE, a creature of a more
cylindrical form than the eel, and possessing other points of
resemblance to the snake tribe ; but although, in the present
day, the term sea serpent would be ill applied to any animal
which breathes by means of branchiz, yet among such crea-
tures, excluding the genera hydrus and hydrophis, and other
true water snakes which inhabit tropical seas, I doubt if the
8ubject of this communication be not at least as well entitled
to that appellation as any hitherto described. - From the
s8everal genera of animals however nearest allied to. it, it
offers points of disagreement s0 impertant, as: to entitle it to
a distinct place in classification, and especially from the for-
mation of the jaws, which, with the exception of the apparent
want of serpentiform inter-articular bones, are truly analogous
to those of snakes ; and, secondly, from the possession of an
enormous elastic sac, which is seemingly a receptacle for air
only. The first of these latter characters appearing to be
the one, of all least liable to vary, I would suggest the term
Ophiognathus as applicable to the genus; its characters are
as follow :
