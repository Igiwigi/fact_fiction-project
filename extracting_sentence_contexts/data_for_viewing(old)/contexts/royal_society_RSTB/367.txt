of the pupa on other parts of the same house were of this colour. Very dark pupe
were shown which had been taken from a tarred fence, and from other dark surfaces,
and in subdued light. One of the pups of this species, found on a white surface,
was nearly white, and Mr. Woop also showed green, reddish, and dusky pup of
P. brassice on surfaces of similar tints. He also stated that the pupa of Vanessa
polychloros, when amongst foliage, is coloured like a withered elm leaf, being light
reddish brown with a cluster of silvery metallic spots (dorsally placed) at the junction
of thorax and abdomen. He also rightly asserted that the gilded appearance is not
necessarily connected with the presence of Ichneumon larve within the pup.
When the pupa is suspended to a wall the gilded appearance is not produced, and the
pupa is of a mottled greyish colour. This observation is very important, for it
contained the obvious implication that the metallic appearance may be controlled by
the surroundings, as I have now proved it to be. In fact, Mr. Woop states, “I feel
convinced that by the proper use of gilded surfaces the gilded chrysalides of Vanessa,
and perhaps of other genera, would be obtained, and I hope to be able to try the
experiment next season.” I was not aware of Mr. Woop’s last suggestion in 1867
when I undertook my experiments on the subject in 1886, and the arguments which
induced me to make use of gilded surfaces are given at the beginning of the experi-
ments. It certainly does seem strange that so remarkable, although so bold, a
suggestion should not have been subjected to any test for nearly twenty years. The
reason is perhaps to be found in Mr. Woop’s unfortunate inclusion of Papilio machaon
among the list of susceptible pups; for Mr. Bonn, who knew the habits of this
