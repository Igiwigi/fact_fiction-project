Goops1r is the only author, as far as I am aware, who has
attempted to prove the close aflinity the ductless glands (excepting the spleen) have
to each other, by tracing out their gradual evolution in the embryo. He states that
all of them (excepting the spleen) arise in involuted portions of the membrana inter-
media, and that at an early period of embryonic life they communicate with one
another. He concludes from this apparent fact, their original identity of function,
which he says is that of elaborating a nutrient material, an office which the germinal
membrane itself performs during fcetal life. The description that I shall now venture to offer, differs from any that has been
previously given of the evolution of this gland. I trust however that I may be able
to prove the close affinity that it has both with the spleen and also with the thyroid,
not 80 much from any resemblance that it may present in its manner of eyolution,
but from the similitude it presents in its elementary parts, and in the development
of those elements to their perfect form.
