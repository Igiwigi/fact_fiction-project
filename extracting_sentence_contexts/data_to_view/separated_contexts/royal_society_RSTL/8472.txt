But not only taste, as
E 8uch, but also the tactile sensibility of the tongue seemed to have been destroyed.
= This was noted as a remarkable phenomenon, and the tests were frequently repeated in
SZ order that no fallacy might be allowed to remain. Not only on the right side of the
< tongue, but also on the left, was this absence of reaction noted. The centres for the
Z tactile sensibility of the tongue on the left side seemed to have been destroyed along
Q with those of special sense, a fact apparently indicating their close anatomical relation
in the hemisphere. The following experiments serve to narrow the boundaries of the
lesions causing these various results as regards hearing and tactile sensation. Experiment XV.
