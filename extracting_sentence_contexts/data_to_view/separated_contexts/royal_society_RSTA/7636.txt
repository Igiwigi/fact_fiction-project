However, before Runcorn’s experimental work was
completed, I decided to put relation (58a) to a direct experimental test in the laboratory. After the experimental disproof by Runcorn and his colleagues of this relation by measure-
ments in mines I continued the experiment, partly for the sake of an independent confirma-
tion of their result, but partly as an exercise in the making of significant measurements of
such small magnetic fields. The magnetometer itself was in fact designed specifically for
this experiment. RELATING TO MAGNETISM AND THE EARTH’S ROTATION — 357

_ The main measurements were made with a gold cylinder of dimension 10 x 10cm and
mass 15-2kg, which was mounted on the piston under the magnetometer, so that it could
raised or lowered a distance up to 13cm from a given lower to a given upper position.
e method of making the observation of the magnetometer spot has already been

If relation (58a) were true for any point mass, the field at a point on the axis of the
cylinder of radius a and height 26 at a distance z from its centre would be given by inte-
ating over the whole volume of the cylinder. I am indebted to Dr Papapetrou for this
alculation which leads to thg following result:

H = pPOP fob + (a? + (2 —) [02+ (2 +)", (59)

When z is much greater than a and 5 this reduces to
+
H=p'2%) (60)
here M = 2na?bp, as it is obvious it must.
