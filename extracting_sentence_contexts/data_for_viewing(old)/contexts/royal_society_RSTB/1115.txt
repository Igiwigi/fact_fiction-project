Re galvanometer, this being evidently due to the fact that the parts with which the
tacts are made, since they form one directly continuous mass with the structures
und them, lie in the path of the derivations of currents, whose primary electro-
tive source is far removed from the electrodes.
a this connection we may refer to the derivations of the electrical difference
between the different regions of the beating* heart which are present in the body.

On connecting two points on the surface of the exposed brain by means of non-
polarisable electrodes with the galvanometer, any reflex movement of the scalp muscles
lying outside the exposed region was found to evoke electrical changes in the points
of contact, and if structures so far removed from the seat of observation can affect the
contacts, how much more easily will these be affected by sources of electromotive differ-
ences situated in the deeper fibres, &., of the brain. The fact that electrical

changes manifest themselves between two surface contacts is thus by itself no proof
that these electrical changes have their source in the tissue in the immediate neigh-
bourhood of the contacts. It is, however, easy to ascertain whether the opposite con-
clusion is or is not true, by slicing off the two portions of the surface to which the
electrodes have been attached, destroying their vitality, and replacing them in contact
with the subjacent tissues, so as to act as mere moist conductors. If under these cir-
