in this sense is usually (there are exceptions) seen as undesirable. As Bohr argued in his reply to
EPR’s paper, QM avoids non-locality, at least in RWR-type interpretations, even though, under
certain circumstances, such as those of the EPR-type experiments, it can make predictions (even
with the probability equal to unity) concerning spatially separated systems [2, pp. 136-154]; [9].
However, the question of the locality of QM or quantum phenomena has been a matter of much
debate, especially in the wake of the Bell and Kochen-Specker theorems.

The concept of contextuality, too, was introduced by Kochen and Specker, and developed
in the course of this history, primarily dealing with the Bohm version of the EPR experiment
for discrete variables and finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. The primary reason for this is that
the (idealized) thought-experiment proposed by EPR, which deals with continuous variables,
cannot be physically realized because the EPR-entangled quantum state is not normalizable,
although this fact does not affect the fundamentals of the case. Bohm’s version of the EPR
experiment, which deals with discrete variables, could and has been performed, confirming the

consistent with locality as just defined and predictions concerning spatially separated systems.


existence of quantum correlations. These correlations can be ascertained experimentally, apart
from QM. By contrast, quantum entanglement is part of the mathematical formalism of QM,
enabling one to predict these correlations. Neither EPR’s article and Bohr’s reply to it used
the terms ‘correlations’ and ‘entanglement’. The term entanglement was introduced, in German
(Verschrankung) and in English, by Schrédinger in responding to EPR’s paper [17]. On the other
hand, the question of locality, in this case versus completeness, was central to the Bohr—Einstein
