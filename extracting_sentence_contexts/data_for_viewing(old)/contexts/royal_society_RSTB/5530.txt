3. Appendages.

The appendages develop as paired out-growths of the body wall on all segments of
the body. All these are at first post-oral, except the labral lobes (if these be considered
as appendages). The antenne, however, quickly assume a preoral position, The
pre-mandibular appendages (fig. 7) are extremely small and transient, the ectoderm of
this segment being concerned with tritocerebral nervous development, its mesoderm
forming the subcesophageal body. In a fully formed embryo and in the hatched larva
(figs. 8 and 6), a pair of rounded lobes are found to exist immediately in front of the
prothoracic legs. In the embryo they have the appearance of a pair of limb-buds
(fig. 9, Plate 2) and might lead one to a false conclusion that an additional head or
thoracic segment was involved. Apart from the fact that no separate neuromere or
somites exist for such a supposed segment, any doubt as to its real significance is
removed by tracing its origin.

In the state shown in fig. 1 it will be seen that the length of the prothoracie segment is
greater than that of other segments. As the first walking leg develops, a prominent
protuberance appears on the anterior side of its basal joint, fig. 3. The groove which
separates this from the basal joint rapidly deepens (figs. 5 and 11), till finally the
