& may, and do, sometimes descend with a uniform motion. The motion of a man in
AQ walking down stairs is on the whole uniform, but it is actually made up of an aggregate
5 of mall motions, each of which is accelerated. It is easy to conceive that ice moving
Z over an uneven bed, will, when it is released from one opposing obstacle, be checked by
= another, and its motion thus be rendered sensibly uniform. So many obstacles exist
Þ along the bed of a glacier, that sudden slipping forwards of the mass through any con-
© giderable distance is not to be expected. But the real weak point of Saus8URE's theory,
.5 though partly true, is its inability to account for many facts observed since his time.
5 The theory of CHarPENTIER, though not always fairly represented, has been shown to be
Z untenable.

S The facts submitted to our consideration are briefly as follows :—We see the glacier
2 winding through a valley, squeezing itself through a gorge, and widening where it has
S room. We xee that the centre moves more quickly than the sides, and the top more
S quickly than the bottom ; and the next demand of the mind is for a general principle
Z which shall unite these facts, and from which they shall follow as physical corollaries.
E Professor FokBgs seeks this principle in the viscosity of the ice. Ice, according to him,
£ is a substance resembling treacle, honey, or tar, and the observed phenomena are a conse-
= quence of this property. In this assumption consists what is called the viscous theory |.

S theory now extant.
