Figure 1. Evolution of meningococcal disease in the US Army in the Vietnam War era. The disease outbreak was predominantly caused by sulphonamide-resistant
organisms belonging to the ST-11 (ET-37 complex), with a capsule replacement event that replaced sulfonamide-resistant serogroup B meningococci with sulfo-
namide-resistant serogroup C organisms.
