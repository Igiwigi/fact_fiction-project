in figure 22a and 1171 ft./sec. in figure 226. The (pressure, time) curves for these impacts
are similar to the curve shown in figure 12; ifa bullet moves with a speed equal to the average
of the above speeds, and if the bullet behaves as a fluid, the time of impact is about 34 sec.,
the maximum pressure in the bar is about 6-8 x 108 dynes/sq.cm., and the time taken by
the pressure to increase from zero to its maximum value is about 9 psec.

The striking feature of these two photographs is the obvious distortion of the main pulse
and the presence of a train of high-frequency oscillations following this pulse. It is clearly
impossible to derive an accurate (pressure, time) curve from these records.

A full discussion of the distortion which appears when a parallel-plate unit is used with
a similar pulse is given in § 12; in the meantime, comparison of figures 22a and 226 with
figure 12 immediately brings out the fact that the slight oscillations of pressure which occur
in the rising part of figure 12 (as shown by the periodic displacements of the experimental

points about the smoothed (£, ¢) curve) are very much smaller than the corresponding oscilla-

tions in figures 22a and 226, whilst the high-frequency oscillations which follow the main

pulse in the latter figures are absent from the former. This agrees with the conclusion reached
: above, and experiments to be described later (see figure 34) do in fact show that with a
| parallel-plate condenser unit, much sharper pulses are necessary to produce measurable
