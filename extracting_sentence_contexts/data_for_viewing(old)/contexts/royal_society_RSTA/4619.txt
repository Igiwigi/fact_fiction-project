]. Introduction

The assessment of tsunami hazard in the Eastern Mediterranean has been severely hampered by
uncertainty in the locations and magnitudes of the causative earthquakes; in consequence a wide
range of calculated scenarios exists for tsunamigenic earthquakes in the region (e.g. [1-5]). The
two most devastating historical tsunamis recorded in the region, those of AD 365 and AD 1303,
were probably generated by large or great (magnitude 2 7 or magnitude > 8) earthquakes at the
Hellenic plate boundary (e.g. [6,7]). There is strong geological evidence that the AD 365 tsunami
was caused by an earthquake in western Crete (e.g. [8-12]) and that another tsunamigenic
earthquake occurred near Rhodes in prehistorical or Roman times [13-16]. Attempts to identify
other source locations along the Hellenic plate boundary have relied on analogies with major
subduction zones around the world, and have defined source parameters on the basis of the :
seismicity of the past few decades. The complexity of this plate boundary zone, and the fact that =
most of the convergence across it is aseismic [17], suggest that the seismicity data, alone, are a 3
misleading guide to likely sources of tsunamigenic earthquakes. Instead, we develop a model that {8
takes advantage of recent understanding of the tsunami hazard at this plate boundary, which has :
developed by combining geological, geophysical, geodetic, geomorphological, geochronological aa)
and historical data (e.g. [10,12,13,18-21]). Dw

The Hellenic plate boundary zone accommodates approximately 40mm yr~! of relative motion
between the oceanic lithosphere of the Eastern Mediterranean (part of the Nubian plate)
and the continental lithosphere of Greece and the Aegean Sea [21-23]. Approximately three-
quarters of this motion arises from distributed deformation within the continental lithosphere
