Lin et
al. found the phenomenon of SR in the frequency oscillation system excited by the LFM signal
and Gaussian white noise [30]. However, there are few studies on the SR caused by the NLFM
signal. In fact, for different types of NLFM signal with very weak noise, by introducing the idea of
segmented processing, aperiodic resonance can occur in a nonlinear system with appropriate
parameters [31]. It should be noted that the traditional evaluating indicator designed based on
the periodic characteristic signal, such as SNR, cannot evaluate the SR effect of the NLFM signal. The establishment of a new evaluation indicator for the NLFM signal is the key factor to induce
the occurrence of SR.
