ยง2. The general outlines of this paper may be briefly indicated here. The principal
known facts regarding the lunar magnetic variation are first summarized, and it is
shown that, so far as they go, they seem most easily explicable in the manner
proposed by Scuusrer for the solar diurnal variations. Nothing in the nature of a
proof is yet possible however. Some new facts, deduced by harmonic analysis of
existing material for the lunar variation at the separate phases of the moon, are then
described, and it is pointed out how they confirm the hypothesis of the variable
conductivity of the atmosphere in a very direct way, and provide a powerful means
of quantitatively investigating the changes of the conductivity.
