translate transient mixed heating to equivalent steady-state mixed heating, by emulating the effect
of secular cooling with fictitious internal heating [132,133], and run a model until it reaches some
steady state; such a steady-state solution is usually independent of initial conditions. This steady-
state approach has been popular because it is easier to characterize steady-state solutions and thus
understand the underlying physics better. However, the effect of secular cooling is sometimes not
properly incorporated, and in that case, simulation results may not find their application to the
dynamics of the Earthâ€™s mantle [134]. If only radiogenic heat production is used in a steady-state
simulation, i.e. the effect of secular cooling is entirely neglected, a resulting solution would be
characterized by too strong upwelling from the bottom (corresponding to unrealistically high
core heat flow). This is because, in a steady-state convection model, the top heat flow must be


equal to the sum of internal heating and the bottom heat flow, so if fictitious internal heating is
not provided to emulate secular cooling, the bottom heat flow has to increase accordingly.

(b) Some remarks on popular notions

By the very nature of radioactive decay, the amount of radiogenic heat production must have been
higher in the past. It is commonly assumed that higher heat production results in more vigorous
convection, but the amount of heat production and the vigour of convection are not directly
related. They are connected through the notion of self-regulation, which was originally suggested
by Urey [135] and then popularized by Tozer [136]. The self-regulation of mantle convection
would work just like homeostasis. If the surface heat flow of the Earth is higher than its internal
heat production, the Earth cools down, lowering the vigour of convection and thus surface heat
