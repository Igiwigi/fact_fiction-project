The compensating hydathodes performed
§ the function of the normal hydathodes and excreted drops of water. After about a
Q week the “‘ compensating hydathodes” disappeared, apparently through drying up on
g account of their delicate structure. The leaf then formed (how soon is not recorded)
“g outgrowths which appear to be exactly like those on Hibiscus and Ipomea, namely,
& * watery blisters arising through growth of the epidermis and of the underlying
.€ layers, so that after a time the leaf has a diseased appearance without dying.” It is
watery blisters” are formed on the under side of the leaf, a
'B fact which is probably connected with the distribution of the stomata. Soraver,t who describes outgrowths on the under sides of the leaves in Lucalyptus
2 globulus and E. rostrata, states that he has produced intumescences artificially in
re Ficus elastica and in Impatiens Sultani, but he does not describe the methods he

%  Résuwmé.—The conclusions to which the evidence furnished by the experiments
= lead may be summarised as follows: There is no doubt that the checking of
€ transpiration (which is normally very active in this plant) by a damp atmosphere, is
one cause of the development of outgrowths, but this by itself is not sufficient, for, as

® the experiments under blue and green glass show, assimilation must also be active.
& There is further evidence (partly furnished by the plants grown under coloured glass)
a that an altered course of metabolism is also involved—a conclusion to which the
Q abnormally abundant development of oil also pots. It seems clear that what occurs
is—(1), a lack of salts, owing to arrested transpiration ; (2), the assimilated carbo-
hydrates are therefore being employed in metabolism with a deficiency of nitrates,
&c. ; and (3), the tissues blocked with water are not respiring normally.
