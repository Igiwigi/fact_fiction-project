tion. When, however, we come to compare the amounts of growth in different seasons
with the usual meteorological records of the period, we at once discern how complicated
is the connexion, and how inadequate are such records for a full explanation of the
differences of result obtained in different seasons.

As we have aid elsewhere: © It is obvious that different seasons will differ almost
infinitely at each succeeding period of their advance, and that, with each variation, the
character of development of the plant will also vary, tending to luxuriance, or t0
maturation, that is, to quantity, or to quality, as the case may be. Hence, only a
very detailed consideration of climatic statistics, taken together with careful periodic
observations in the field, can afford a really clear perception of the connexion between
the ever-fluctuating characters of season and the equally fluctuating characters of
growth and produce. It is, in fact, the distribution of the various elements making
up the season, their mutual adaptations, and their adaptation to the stage of growth
of the plant, which throughout influence the tendency to produce quantity or quality.
It not unfrequently happens, too, that some passing conditions, nob indicated by a
summary of the meteorological registry, may affect the crop very strikingly ; and thus
the cause will be overlooked, unless careful observations be also made, and the stage of
progress, and tendencies of growth, of the crop itself at the time, be likewise taken into
account.” Again : © Those characters of season which are very unfavourable for land
in poor condition, may be favourable to land in high condition, and vice versd.”
