When solving a family of related
problems, discovering abstractions can drastically reduce the difficulty of harder problems: even
complex programs can have short implementations in terms of the appropriate library. This
insight has a direct interpretation in the land of mathematical reasoning: the difficulty of a
mathematical problem also heavily depends on the ‘library’—of existing lemmas or tactics. Given

1m fact, in modern proof assistants such as Isabelle /HOL, SMT solvers can be called to find proofs for sub-problems that are
expressible in a theory they support.
