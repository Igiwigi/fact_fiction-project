Terry calls the orbitoparietal commissures. Lastly, an anterior parietocapsular
commissure is formed.

In Talpa, NoorpenBos (1905) showed that the tectum posterius arises separate from
the parietal plate and occipital arch, and that the parietal plate arises separate from
the canalicular capsule. The parietal plate soon joins the canalicular capsule, and the
tectum posterius joins the top of the occipital arches. Then the tectum posterius joins
the parietal plate, while lastly, the synchondrosis orbitoparietalis joins the ala orbitalis
with the parietal plate.

In Lepus, however, as the present results show, the tectum posterius has a paired
origin in the form of the supraoccipital cartilages, which chondrify independently of
the occipital arches and of the parietal plates. In fact, the conditions agree with the
interpretation of the posterior region of the skull of Erinaceus, given by Fawcerr
(1918a). First, the supraoccipital cartilage joins the occipital arch, and later the
parietal plate, which is independent of the canalicular capsule. Next, the ala orbitalis
joins the canalicular capsule by the orbitocapsular commissure, and lastly the parietal
plate establishes connexion with this orbitocapsular commissure by means of the
orbitoparietal commissure.

If the commissures are given the names of the structures between which they establish
connexion, then, owing to the relatively different times at which these connexions are
made in the various forms, different names would have to be used, with the consequent
danger of confusion. The order of their appearance is the following :â€”
