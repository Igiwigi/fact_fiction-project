initial input (in this case by the magnitude of the earthquake). A simple order-of-magnitude
computation based on scaling laws [117] suggests that the maximum run-up envisioned (4.4m
before the influence of tide) would correspond to source slips <2.5m, or magnitudes <7.5, which
clearly underestimates the seismicity off eastern Honshu, even before the occurrence of the 2011
Tohoku earthquake.

In addition, it defies common sense that the maximum wave height presented under an
alleged worst-case scenario (6m) would be five to six times less than the waves documented a few
hundred kilometres to the north during the 1896 Sanriku tsunami (38m) or, even more recently,
the 1933 normal faulting event (29 m). While it could be argued that the latter was not part of the
subduction cycle expected to produce the majority of great earthquakes in the region, an engineer
working to protect a critical structure such as a nuclear plant should not be driven by the details of
the geological nature of a hazard, but merely by the fact that its occurrence in the past proves that
it will happen again in the future. Finally, it is also against common sense that the hazard from
an alleged worst-case scenario for a local source would be comparable with that from a far-field
source at the other end of the Pacific basin.

In summary, the simulations performed by the TEPCO committee were certainly not
computationally wrong, but their initial conditions were grossly inadequate to represent the
worst-case scenario that the protection of a nuclear plant should require. The selection of source
parameters led to a verdict of safety for the plant by inexplicably ignoring aspects of Japanese
seismicity notorious not only in the scientific community, but also within the most senior fragment
of Japanese population, i.e. survivors of the 1933 event. It is hard to believe that educated ‘experts’
would not have been familiar with this evidence, and thus the motivation behind their use of
deficient parameters as ‘design sources’ is at best obscure, at worst suspect.
