The individual fibres of the
investing connective tissue sheath, on the other hand, run at right angles to the muscles;
in this respect they are orientated in a manner similar to the internal fibres of the retention
sheath of the podium (vide infra, p. 288). The ampulla of Asterias rubens (figure 4B, amp.) is a spherical sac. Apart from the fact
that the muscles in its neck have a rather different arrangement from the similarly situated
ones in Astropecten the general disposition of both muscle and connective tissue fibres is
much the same in the two forms. It is not known whether the possession of a simple or of a bilobed ampulla has any
functional significance. Taking the class of the Asteroidea as a whole and adopting the
classification of Mortensen (1927), it appears that.
