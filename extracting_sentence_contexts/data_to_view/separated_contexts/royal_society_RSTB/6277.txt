After the base of the polyp has risen slowly by the
deposition behind it of lamella after lamella, its axial parts are suddenly uplifted
through a distance corresponding to the thickness of (possibly) a hundred lamellae,
so that a space is left, which is bounded towards the periphery by the lamellae at
the axial ends of the minor septa. That this space is due to a sudden upward

movement of the axial part of the base of the polyp, and not to a temporary cessation
of the secreting powers of this part of the ectoderm, is proved by the fact that the
peripheral extensions of the lamellae laid down to form the tabula follow immediately
the peripheral extensions of the lamellae at the bottom of the space (fig. 43, Plate 30). *
The development of tabulae, or rather of inter-tabulate spaces, is due to the periodic
relief of stress in the base of the polyp (see Introduction).
