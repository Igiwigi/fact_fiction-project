7. SIGNIFICANCE OF CoLOURLEsS Form. A. Discussion of Recorded Mutations. The essential facts in the preceding pages may be summarised as follows: The

colourless form arose spontaneously without any evident relation to external con-
ditions or stimuli, in a single sclerotium of a culture which on accepted criteria was a
pure line. The new form is apparently differentiated from its parent in respect to a
single character only, that of colour, and this albinism would appear to be associated
with the absence of a factor for chromogen. .The change has occurred once only,
and has given rise to a form unknown in nature and perfectly constant under all
conditions.
