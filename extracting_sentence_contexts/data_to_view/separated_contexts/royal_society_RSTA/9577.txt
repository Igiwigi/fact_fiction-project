where the atomic size factors are favourable, the curves are essentially of the same
nature as regards the maximum electron concentration, but there are characteristic
deviations which are due to differences in the phases with which the «-solid-solution is
in equilibrium. Generally speaking, the more electronegative the solute element, the
greater is the tendency for the formation of stable intermediate compounds at the
expense of the «-solution, and it is for this reason that in systems such as copper-arsenic,
or copper-selenium, the «-solid-solution is very restricted in spite of the fact that the
atomic size factors are favourable. This tendency which may be called the “electro-
negative valency effect,” is probably the cause of the rapid diminution of the solubility
limit in the copper-silicon alloys at low temperatures, since silicon is the most electro-
negative of the tetravalent elements. At present there do not appear to be any accurate determinations of ternary diagrams
at the lower temperatures by means of which a critical test can be made, but the
general application of the preceding electron concentration methods of calculations with
appropriate correction terms is obvious.
