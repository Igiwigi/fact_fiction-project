tion of homologies in which exact criteria are employed has been one of the most
difficult aspects of the description of the series of brains under consideration. It is
easy to fall into the error of appearing exact by conforming the material to classi-
ficatory patterns—a danger so aptly put by Heap in his discussion on Aphasia :

“The tendency to appear exact by disregarding the complexity of the
factors is an old failing in medical history. Each patient with a speech defect
of cerebral origin is stretched on the procrustean bed of some theoretical scheme ;
something is lopped away at one part, something at another, until the pheno-
mena are said to correspond to some diagrammatic conception, which never
has and never could have existed. And yet neurologists continue to cling to
these schemes, modifying them to suit each case, conscious that they do not
correspond in any way to the facts they are supposed to explain”’.

Despite these dangers, tentative classificatory schemes-in science are to a large
extent unavoidable. Throughout this work on the Australian brain, classifications
of the sulci and of whole areas are employed, and the classifications are summed up
in tables of percentage occurrence. Realizing the dangers, these classifications have
been used as a means to an end ; they are arbitrary in their choice and consequently
open to alteration without hesitation. Furthermore, the summing up in terms of per-
centage grouping is merely a matter of convenience ; for the essential racial and
functional features of any particular brain can never be submerged under a mass
of figures dealing with other brains. Percentage figures and endless columns of
figures are not morphological features and frequently tend to obscure the fundamental
features of structure.
