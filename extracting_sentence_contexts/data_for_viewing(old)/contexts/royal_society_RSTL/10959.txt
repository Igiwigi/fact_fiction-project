5 I have not added certain figures made from the skull of the adult Water Shrew

A (Cros80pus fodiens) ; it merely differs from that of the Common Shrew (Sores vul-
garis) by its larger size, greater robustness, and a somewhat, more intense ossification
generally. The orbitosphenoids are wider, and the © foramen ovale ” is quite visible on
the lower aspect of the skull ; in the common kind (Plate 31, fig. 2) the bristle (V®.)
is 8een to pass over the incurved lower glenoid process ; there is a notch between it
and the hind corner of the alisphenoid (al.s.), and then a bridge of bone between this
notch and the fore-end of the great infero-lateral fontanelle. In Cross0pus Jodiens
the emerging nerve is bounded in front by a tract of bone, where the notch is in the
lesser third ; here it appears to pass throngh the neck of the lower glenoid process ; as

a matter of fact, the foramen is made by the confluence of the alisphenoid with that

part of the 8quamoxsal.
