In all attempts hitherto made to determine the interdiffusivity of gases, these
were initially at equal pressure, and therefore contained an equal number of mole-
cules in equal volumes, so that the one gas had to diffuse against an equal and
opposite flow of the other. This is a totally distinct set of conditions from those of
the problem before us, where we require to investigate the rate of the diffusive flow
of carbon dioxide of very low initial pressure down a stationary column of air on its
way to an absorbent surface. The new conditions.are in fact practically the same as
those referred to by HAUSMANINGER and by O, E. Maver (see Mayer's ‘ Kinetic
Theory of Gases,’ Engl. ed., 1899, p. 267), who state that in order to more fully
elucidate the theory of diffusion we require to determine the value of & in gaseous
mixtures containing only small masses of one of the constituents.

Let us, in the first instance, imagine a vertical cylinder filled with ordinary air at
a perfectly uniform temperature and of exactly the same composition as that of the
outside atmosphere, the length of the cylinder being such as to cause no appreciable
difference in the density of the air column. If we regard any plane surface within
the enclosed air it follows from the kinetic theory that in a given time the same
average number of carbon dioxide molecules will cross this plane in opposite direc-
tions, and there will, consequently, be no change in the average distribution of the
