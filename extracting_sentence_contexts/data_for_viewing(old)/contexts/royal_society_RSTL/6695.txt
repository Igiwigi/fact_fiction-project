that of dried air. A. roll of bibulous paper, taken from one of the drawers of the labo-
ratory, and to all appearance perfectly dry, was enclosed in a glass tube, and dry air
carried between its leaves. The experiment was made five times in succession with the
same paper, and the following absorptions were observed :;—

In fact, the action of aqueous vapour is exactly 8uch as might be expected from the
vapour of a liquid which MEgrLLoxt found to be the most powerful absorber of radiant
heat of all he had examined,

Every morning, on commencing my experiments, T had an interesting example of the
power of glass to gather a film of aqueous vapour on its surface. Suppose the tube
mounted, and the air of the laboratory removed as far as the air-pump was capable of
removing it. On allowing dry air to enter for the first time, the needle would move
from 0* to 50*. On pumping out it would return to 0”, and on letting in dry air a 8econd
time it would swing almost to 40%. Repeated exhaustions would cause this action to
sink almost to nothing. These results were entirely due to the vapour collected during
the night in an invisible film on the inner surface of the tube, and which was removed
by the air on entering, and diffused through the tube. Tf the dry air entered at the
