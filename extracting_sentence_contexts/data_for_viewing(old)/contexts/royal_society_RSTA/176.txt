in inorganic systems. Protein folding is an example for a very large unit that
requires the consideration of enthalpic and entropic properties for the assessment
of their statistical mechanics and kinetics. Entropy and entropy flow are also
crucial parameters for the modelling of other complex systems in both biology and
game theory, while this aspect has been explored to a much lesser extent, so far,
in inorganic solids. However, there appears very little evidence that evolutionary
tendencies are directly related to complexity at a molecular level. As an example,
it appears that protein-coded genes are almost as complex in sea anemones as in
humans (Technau 2008). The distinction may well be related to the small RNAs
that protect the genome from transposes and show a high degree of evolutionary
flexibility (Grimson et al. 2008). The key for such behaviour seems to lie in
the fact that even very simple systems, such as illustrated above in the case
of simple harmonic chains with competing springs, lead already to bifurcations
and dynamic complexity. This argument has already been made some time ago
by May & Oster (1976) and has lost none of its significance. Complexity may not,
in the sense as discussed here, lead to novel behaviour, but when complexity is
combined with multi-scaling, it may well produce phenomena that go far beyond
our current expectations.
