Since o*(Si) © 60*(Ge) it follows that the dendrite tip radius of germanium is almost three times
larger than the dendrite tip radius of silicon. This explains why the dendrite growth velocity of Ge
is systematically smaller than the dendrite growth velocity of Si, cf. figure 3. It can be understood
by the fact that a fat dendrite propagates more slowly than a thin dendrite [43]. According to
solvability theory, the stability parameter o* is correlated to the anisotropy ¢ of the solid—liquid
interfacial energy as o*(e) « e7/* in the case of fourfold symmetry. In the case of sixfold symmetry,
o*(e) x 7/6 [44].
