These haloes are only well formed around very minute nuclei. Traces of them
appearing round larger nuclei are not of value; the nuclear correction becomes too
large and uncertain.

These haloes obviously correspond to the remarkable maximum of the curve of
ionisation given, ante, fig. 1. They, therefore, must involve pre-eminently the ranges
of U, and U,. But they do not possess the quite correct radius called for by the
curve, Converting the range in mica into corresponding ranges in air the first ring is
found to be placed in the position shown above the curve. The darkened area
(marked 1) is a section of the ring halo.

A discussion of this point cannot be entered on till further facts are considered.

When the darkening within the first ring is yet only in its initial stages the outer
shell due to RaC may begin to appear. This is seen in the published photographs.*
The extreme radius of the outer ring at this stage is very little less than it finally
becomes. Attention has already been called to the bearing of the early appearance
of the effects of RaC upon views as to the mode of origin of the halo.

Looking at the drawing, fig. 2, Plate 1, the first ring is seen almost lost in the
darkening of the central region. This region has now become a “pupil.” Around it
in the form of a delicate ring appears the “second ring.” The second ring is rarely
seen. I have found it but twice in the Ballyellen mica, although some scores of haloes
