When only the homochiral terms are kept in the NSEs the system reduces to
dru’ = PS[(us x w')] + vV2u8 + £. (2.9)

In this case, the two helical fields u* evolve independently, with the nonlinearity conserving their
energy and helicity

However, unlike the NSE, in the homochiral version the two helicities are sign definite quantities
with H+ >0 and H~ <0. The sign definiteness of the helicity has a profound impact on the
cascade. As shown in [43,44], it leads to an inverse cascade. In fact, when H* are sign definite
one can show that a simultaneous forward cascade of €° and H® is incompatible (using similar
arguments to Fjortoft [45] for the dual cascade of energy and enstrophy in two dimensions,
see [36] §3.5). On the contrary, for the original Navier-Stokes case (4 = 1), and in the presence
of a large-scale helical forcing, the energy and helicity cascades are observed to be forward as
originally proposed in [46] and later verified numerically [42,47].

(c) The A-Navier—Stokes model

The different roles played by the homochiral and heterochiral interactions led Sahoo et al. [37] to
propose a model that transitions from the forward cascading Navier-Stokes (2.6) to the inverse
cascading homochiral Navier-Stokes (2.9) varying continuously a parameter 4. In detail, the
model reads
