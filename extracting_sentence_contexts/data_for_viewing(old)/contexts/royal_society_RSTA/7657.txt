distribution of amplitude among the different stations suggests both that the foci of
individual earthquakes are regions of limited extent and that they are in many
instances close to the surface of the earth compared with the distance between stations,
i.e. within 1 or 2 km. of the surface. Otherwise, if the foci were all deep seated, we
should expect to find the amplitude for all stations nearly equal for all shocks. These
conclusions are strengthened by the fact that in estimating the position of the foci it
has been necessary in some instances to assume that the distribution in amplitude is
affected markedly by certain surface features (cf. ยง 9).

In some volcanic regions, notably in Hawaii, earthquakes occur most frequently
when magma is falling in the volcanic crater. On the other hand, the history of
events in the Lesser Antilles suggests that earthquakes occur most frequently in this
region at times of increasing magmatic pressure. The fact that seismic activity has,
in some instances, terminated with the occurrence of a volcanic eruption is then to
be regarded as a consequence of the release of magmatic pressure. It is possible that

such a release of pressure was brought about in the neighbourhood of Montserrat by
the occurrence of the severe earthquake of 10 November 1935.

The most plausible explanation of the local earthquakes in Montserrat is therefore
that they are due to magmatic intrusion. Such a view accounts for the fact that the
disturbed regions are very restricted in area and offers a simple explanation of the
