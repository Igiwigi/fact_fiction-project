While the severe difficulties in narrowing down projection ranges through the rejection of
individual models have here only been examined for sea ice, our findings are generally true
for any metric for which the observational period is too short to robustly remove the impact

of internal variability, where in our case even 30 years are too short a period to fulfil this criterion. : =
The most prominent example for a metric with similar issues is arguably the evolution of global- : yy
mean surface temperature, where the 15-year-long hiatus that occurs in temperature records that 2
do not include measurements in the Arctic does not allow us to robustly reject climate-model aes
simulations as unrealistic [19]. : _

It should also be noted that even if one manages to robustly reject a particular simulation : Ss
of, say, Arctic sea-ice evolution as unrealistic, this does not necessarily imply that the sea-ice : S
component of that particular model is insufficient. This is exemplified by the fact that the sea- : s
ice simulations of the CMIP5 ensemble differ substantially from those of the CMIP3 ensemble, [2

while the sea-ice model components of most models remained largely unchanged from CMIP5
to CMIP3. The change in simulated sea ice is hence only explicable through a different tuning
of this component, or through changes in other components of the Earth System Models. Such
changes will usually directly affect the sea-ice simulations as on the temporal scales typical for
large-scale models the time evolution of the sea-ice cover depends primarily on the total amount
of heat that is provided to the ice from both the atmosphere and the ocean. If this amount of
heat is modelled unrealistically, not even the best sea-ice model could produce a reasonable time
evolution of the sea-ice cover. By contrast, if the amount of heat that is provided to the ice is
modelled realistically, even a relatively simple sea-ice model component will produce reasonable
results regarding, for example, the time evolution of sea-ice volume. While a better understanding
