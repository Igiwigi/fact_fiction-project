When
double the amount of ammonia-salts was employed, by which the crop was still further
increased, the proportion of the supplied Nitrogen which was recovered as increase Was
almost identically the same ; but with more still, the proportion was less. Again, when the smaller amount of ammonia-salts was applied annually, for six years,
to barley, the increased yield of Nitrogen corresponded to only about 42 per cent. of the

Nitrogen supplied in the manure; and when the double amount of the manure was
employed for barley, over the same series of years, only about 43 per cent. of the 8UP-
plied Nitrogen were recovered as increased yield. To the statement of these facts it should be added that the Nitrogen (equal in amount
to, 8ay 60 per cent. of that supplied in the manure) which is not obtained as increased
yield in the immediate crop does not appear to exist, in the 80il ayailably for an imme-
diately succeeding crop. Thus, when by the use of nitrogenous manures an increased
yield of Nitrogen has been obtained in the first sncceeding wheat-crop, equal in amount
to about 40 per cent. of the Nitrogen supplied in the manure, the increased yield obtained
in the second crop, without any further 8upply, is equal to little more than one-tenth of

Athe remainder. Y In connexion with this subject it may be mentioned that, so far as our experiments with

Ameadow-grasses at present show, it does not appear that the increased yield of Nitrogen

Zin the crop on the use of nitrogenous manures bears a much higher proportion to the

Smount supplied in their case than in that of either wheat or barley.
