For instance, SPW-Rs,
[62,63]. These findings suggest that observed BOLD signal slow waves, and many other neural processes are enriched
propagation likely corresponds to widespread, propagating in (awake) post-task learning periods as well as sleep
shifts in excitability, the mechanisms of which are yet to be [68,73,74]. In fact, we have indeed found that propagation
understood. Although we cannot presently elucidate patterns in rs-fMRI are sensitive to physiological changes
propagation mechanisms, extant findings do offer some in state, including before versus after motor learning tasks
hints. First, the two cortical hemispheres are completely [26], eyes open versus closed [26] and most dramatically,
synchronous, with no lag in activity [33,42].
