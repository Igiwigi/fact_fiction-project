formed, This was owing to some additional water getting into the jar in which the
larvze were developing, and so altering the concentration of the larvee.

The results obtained with the colour varieties of Strongylocentrotus on the one
hand, and those of Spherechinus on the other, thus afford a somewhat instructive
comparison. In the one case, in which the colour varieties are not very distinctly
marked off, the differential fertility is so slight that it cannot with certainty be said
to have been demonstrated at all; whilst in the other case, where the varieties them-
selves are much more distinct, and where the individuals of intermediate character
are much less numerous, well-marked variations of physiological compatibility were in
every case shown to be present.

Attention has already been drawn to the fact that the nature of the sperm is of
considerable influence on the size of the larvae. It was, of course, taken for granted
that the nature of the ovum had also an influence, but upon what does this influence
depend? Is it upon some intrinsic properties of the protoplasm, or chiefly upon the
actual amount of food material available in the ovum? In order to get information
on this question, some measurements of the unfertilised ova themselves were made.
These were measured in the same manner as the larvae, the diameter of the yolk
substance, and not of the vitelline membrane in addition, being determined. In the
fresh unfertilised ova there is, of course, no visible membrane, but one is almost
invariably formed in the course of preservation. At first, fifty of the ova were
measured in each case, but subsequently, in that the range of variation in the size of
the ova of each group was found to be but slight, only twenty-five. The results
obtained were the following :â€”
