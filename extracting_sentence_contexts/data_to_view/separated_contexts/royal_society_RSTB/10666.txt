An inability to repair DSBs can trigger chromosome loss and cell death,
while misrepaired DSBs can lead to mutations and chromosomal aberrations
such as translocations. Collectively, defects in DSB repair can result in genome
instability. The significance of the DDR is highlighted by the fact that dysfunc-
tional DDR pathways can promote human diseases including cancer, ageing
and neurodegenerative disorders [2]. In mammalian cells, DSBs are repaired
by two dominant pathways, canonical non-homologous end joining (c-NHE))
and homologous recombination (HR) [3,4]. C-NHE] involves the direct re-ligation
of two broken DNA ends together without a DNA template, whereas HR
engages a homologous DNA sequence as a template to repair DNA (figure 1).
