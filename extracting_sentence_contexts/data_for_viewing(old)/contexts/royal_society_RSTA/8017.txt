The additional correction of — 0-002° Pt. arises from the fact that a comparison at
50° C. of the indications of T, and T, with those of standard thermometers of known 3
showed that the value of 5 for T, and T, was somewhat higher than that for 0. A
correction of — 0-002° Pt. is sufficient to adjust this difference at 20° C. Platinum
temperatures were corrected to values in terms of degrees Centigrade on the Inter-
national Temperature Scale by means of a conversion table, based on the usual formula
(t — ty) = 5.t ((— 100) 104 for a value of 3 = 1-500, which was supplied by the
Physics Department of the Laboratory.

Readings of the barometer gauge and its associated thermometers are shown in the
section of Table XIX devoted to pressure measurements. The index correction has
already been referred to in Appendix I. The reduction to the standard temperature
of 0° C. was made in the usual manner, account being taken of the fact that the baro-
meter is a Kew Pattern instrument. The difference of level between the étalon system
and the cistern of the gauge barometer was 9 inches and a correction of — 0-021 mm.
was accordingly applied to the mean reading of the barometer. As the value of gravity
at the Laboratory is 981-195 cm. per sec. per sec., the correction to reduce a barometer
reading h at the Laboratory to the standard gravity value 980-665 cm. per sec. per sec.
is + 0:530 h/980-665.

The last portion of Table XIX gives a summary of the determination No. XXVII
of Xy, and includes all the information necessary for the reduction of the observed
