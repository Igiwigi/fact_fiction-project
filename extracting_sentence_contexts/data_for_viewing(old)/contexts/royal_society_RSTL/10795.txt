gecond coat was applied and then flatted down with a brush. An ordinary white
card placed alongside it appeared yellowish, while the coated card seemed bluish
by contrast.

The portion of the screen used for receiving the lights to be compared was limited
to a space about 2 inches square by a sheet of black paper, with a hole of that size
cub in ib placed close in front of and in contact with the screen.

$ VII. The Comparison-Light.

In electing a comparison-light it should be remembered that it has to be moved
and is not fixed in position, An electric glow lamp, with a constant current through
it, would no doubt be very convenient were it not for the fact that it does not
give out light symmetrically in all directions, owing to the different surface of carbon
exposed ; and the slightest deviation in angular position makes a considerable dif-
ference in the illuminating value of such a source at the screen. The flexible connexion
necessary for a gas flame is a source of error, as it is liable to get pinched, and the supply
of gas to be thus made irregular, and although many readings were taken with a gas
flame we found it inferior, with the appliances at our command, to an ordinary candle,
or to the SIEMENS's standard unit lamp burning amy] acetate, which has the value of
about *9 of such a candle.

In the experiments recorded in the immediately following pages a candle was used
as the comparison light. Burnt as we burnt it, open to the air but not exposed to
