The boundary conditions in problems of stretching of plates occur naturally in this form. OF ELLIPTIC DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 365
and the known derivative at B gives
hwy = A}+C,A3+.... (B. 10) Expressing differences up to a certain order in terms of pivotal values, (B. 9) and (B. 10)
provide two equations from which the fictitious points 0 and 1 can be obtained in terms of
other pivotal values. Retaining fourth differences, for example, (B.9) and (B.10) can be
expressed in the forms
wy(1—C,+C,—C,+C,) +w,(C, —2C,+3C,—4C,) = Wp —W>(C,—3C, + 6C,) —ws(Cy—4C,) —wyC,+A,, (B11)
