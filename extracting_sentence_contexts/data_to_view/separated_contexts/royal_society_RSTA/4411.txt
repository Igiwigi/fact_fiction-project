It is worth while to consider the amount of fictitious fecundity suggested by
the reduction factor 3. We have only to suppose the n,/N of our p. 277 to be 3. Now we may well assume the chance of a fictitious fecundity being recorded to be
the same for either one of a pair of sisters ; hence we shall have p = q, and therefore,
from the result on p. 276, we find (p — 1)?/p?=2. This gives us (p — 1)p= 4,
and (7, + 7;)/N the fraction without fictitious values = (p — 1)/p = 6325. Thus
in order to introduce the reduction factor of 2 by the occurrence of fictitious values
of the fecundity, we should have to suppose about 37 per cent.
