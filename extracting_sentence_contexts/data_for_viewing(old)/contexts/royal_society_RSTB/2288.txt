V. Comparison or ExpertMents.

In the first two experiments the same procedure was carried out, the one experi-
ment simply being a repetition of the other. In the third experiment the same
nerves were divided, but each nerve was simply reunited as accurately as possible,
with the object of ascertaining if the fact of crossing appreciably affected the
recovery in any way. The third experiment had the advantage of the wound
healing by first intention, while in the two in which the crossing was carried out,
the wounds did not heal absolutely by first intention.

a, Restoration of Voluntary Cv-ordinated Movements.â€”In the animals in which
the nerves had been crossed, both may be said to have regained completely or almost
completely voluntary co-ordinated movements of the limb. Their recovery of the
use of the fore-limb was at least so good, that no doubt could be entertained of the
return of voluntary co-ordinated movements. Thus the animals made constant and
correct use of the leg in running and walking, placing the paw on the ground
correctly, palmar surface down, and without exhibiting over-extension at the radio-
carpal joint. (Plate 36.) They could stand on the affected limb while they gave the
