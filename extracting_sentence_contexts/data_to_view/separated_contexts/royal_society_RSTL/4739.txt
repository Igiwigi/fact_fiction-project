If the solution of the iodide
be digested with freshly precipitated protoxide of silver, the solution at once assumes
a powerfully alkaline reaction, iodide of silver being formed : the same effect is pro-
duced by the action of caustic baryta upon the sulphate, sulphate of baryta being
precipitated. These reactions, when viewed collectively, exhibit a striking analogy
between the new iodide and the metallic iodides, especially those of the alkali-metals. In fact the molecular group combined with iodine, in the compound under examina-
tion, behaves like sodium or potassium ; it is a true organic metal in all its bearings. For this metal I propose, on the ground of its formation and composition, the name
Tetrethylammonium (76pa), which implies that it is built up by the intimate union
of nitrogen with four equivalents of the hypothetical hydrocarbon called ethyl, and
that it may be viewed as ammonium, in which the whole of the hydrogen is replaced
by an equiyalent proportion of the aboye hydrocarbon. 362 DR. A. W. HOFMANN'S RESEARCHES INTO THE
