showed marked differences in the median lethal concentration
(48h LCs 9 for Daphnia magna) across NaCl (3.21 ¢ rl,
5.92 mS cm™'), synthetic SW (approx. 4.29g17! of NaCl;
7.76 mS cm) and filtered natural SW (9.54 mS cm~!). How-
ever, this profile was altered after acclimation to salinity,
with synthetic SW becoming the most toxic form [10]. This
study demonstrates there is still some uncertainty in the risk
assessment of salinization, since benchmark values can vary
substantially by choosing to use artificial or natural SW.

Adding to the above, most studies involved exposure to sal-
inity in a single generation, but, in the field, exposure occurs
over various generations. In fact, both exposure to pulsed SW
intrusions (e.g. extreme climate phenomena) and continued
exposure (e.g. through groundwater intrusion) are of relevance,
especially for short-lived and multivoltine biota. Therefore, it is
important to understand if organisms are capable to acclimate
to increased salinity, a phenomenon already reported for
algae [23] and daphnids [18,25]. To better cope with salinization
episodes, acclimation may occur via short-term compensatory
physiological /osmoregulatory changes within their life cycle,
like vacuolar compartmentalization or ion sequestration in

producers [26], or the triggering of an osmoregulatory reaction
in cladocerans [27]. More recently, the role of epigenetic
