Besides the considerable empiricism embedded in any of the scale-determining ty
transport equations, the assumption that the behaviour of turbulent flows could be modelled via : _
an assumed eddy viscosity was itself a highly limiting concept that became less and less tenable : Ss
as attention shifted to flows with increasingly complex strain fields. Indeed, in many cases, there : S
would be the added complication of force-field effects such as buoyancy, too. In fact, from the : Ss
1930s, physicists had been seeking ways to approximate the turbulent stresses by routes that did :&

not assume a linear connection between strain rate and Reynolds stress. Proposals were advanced
for determining all relevant second- and third-moment turbulent velocity products directly from
transport equations, e.g. [24]. There was, however, no prospect (or risk) of these proposals being
tested: their advocates were purely armchair explorers!
