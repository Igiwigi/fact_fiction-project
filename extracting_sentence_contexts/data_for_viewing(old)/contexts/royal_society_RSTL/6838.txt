There is no reason for assuming that the fine fibres in all cases are but an early stage
of development of the dark-bordered fibres; for the two classes of fibres undoubtedly
exist at every period of life of the animal, even in old age. I conclude, therefore, that
these peculiar ganglion-cells in the frog are connected with both classes of fibres; and
in mammalia the apparently spherical ganglion-cells, which answer to these pear-haped
cells of the frog, are connected with both grey and dark-bordered fibres.

It is exceedingly difficult to follow an individual fibre for any distance in the trunk of
a nerve. I have seen nerve-fibres dividing in the trunks near to ganglia, and on two! or
three occasions I have almost convinced myself that one of the fibres resulting from the
subdivision passed to a ganglion-cell, while the other passed on in. the trunk of the nerve;
but I have not succeeded in preserving an undoubted specimen of ach an arrangement.
The difficulty of following one individual fibre is much increased by the fact that the
nerves, vary 80 much in thickness within a very short distance. Dark-bordered fibres
may be very distinct, and within a distance of two thousandths of an inch may be 80 thin
as to be scarcely demonstrable, swelling out again a little further on. This renders it
necessary to isolate an individual fibre from its neighbours' before its course: can. be
traced with positive certainty for any great distance. A good example of the varying
diameter of dark-bordered fibres within a short distance is represented in fig. 39,

The observations recorded in page 549 8eem- to show that a. ganglion-cell may be
developed upon a nerve-fibre already formed. Hence these ganglion-cells' cannot, be
regarded as centres from which two nerye-fibres proceed direct to their peripheral
distribution, but as centres placed at a part of Â« circuit which eaisted as a complete
circuit before the ganglion-cell was developed in connexion with it. Tt is impoxsible to
