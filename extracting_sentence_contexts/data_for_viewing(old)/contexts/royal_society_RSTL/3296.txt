has been worn away, Here it was not possible, from the non-existence of higher
land, that the boulders could have rolled into their present places from above, after
the formation of the shelves; nor was this at all probable in several parts of Tom-
bhran. On the supposition of the boulders having been originally scattered over the
country, and the shelves formed at a subsequent period, we have the difficulty, though
perhaps not an insuperable one, as we do not know their original size, of believing
that blocks of granite have been preserved for a long period on those very places,
where a zone of gneiss had been cut into and worn away. Some of the boulders on
Tombhran were lying on the surface of the lower edge of the shelves, in parts where,
as above said, I fully believe the inclination of the ground was s0 trifling that it was
impossible they could have rolled down from above; but I regret much that I omitted,
from not having perceived its importance, to ascertain this point with certainty. If
the fact be 80, and I scarcely doubt it, it would prove that some action, s0 quiet as
not to have disturbed the small quantity of earth and little stones, of which the shelyes
are formed, transported these boulders across deep arms of the sea, and left them on
the surface of the ancient beaches. The theory, that all erratic blocks, circumstanced
like these of Lochaber, have been transported by floating ice, wholly removes these
difficulties ; for the icebergs, in the first place, would generally land the fragments,
with which they were charged, on the lower part of the beaches or shelves; and
secondly, those which had arrived not long before a fresh elevation would have
been exposed only to a small amount of tidal degradation. Thirdly, the icebergs
would frequently be stranded on shoals and islets, over and round which the tides
Swept; and likewise they would be frequently driven on shore in the narrow parts of
the channels, where the waters were pent up. So that in after times, when the land
was drained, it is easy to perceive that the boulders would lie scattered in such places,
