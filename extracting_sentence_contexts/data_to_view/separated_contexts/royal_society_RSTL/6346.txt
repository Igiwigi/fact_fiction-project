of mineral matter. The increase over the last few months of high feeding, of 7
fed for curing, will however contain higher percentages of both fat and total dry
stance, and lower ones of both nitrogenous compounds and mineral matter, than that
of the more moderately fattened animal. p
From the whole of the evidence the striking fact appears, that about three-fourths of
the gross increase in live-weight of animals * feeding ‚Äù for the butcher, will be dry or
Solid matter of some kind. About two-thirds of the gross increase will be pure fat,
Only about 7 or 8 per cent. of the gross increase, and scarcely more than one-tenth of
its total dry snbstance, will be nitrogenous compounds.
