numbers a < b, the definition of (A) will allow the calculation of the probability,
say P {a = x < 5} of x having a value such that a Ss x < b.

We notice also that as x is not constant in (A), it is possible to find at least one
pair of elements, A, and A,, of (A) such that the corresponding values of x, say
x, < %,, are different. Ifwe denote by B the property distinguishing both A, and A,
from all other elements of (A) and if a < b are two numbers such that a < x, <b
<x, then P{a = x < 6|B} =}. It follows that if x is a random variable in the
sense of the above definition, then there must exist such properties B and such
numbers a < ) that 0 < P {a = x < b|B} <1.

It is obvious that the above two properties are equivalent to the definition of a
random variable. In fact, if x has the properties (a) that whatever a <b the
definition of the fundamental probability set (A) allows the calculation of the
probability P {a = x < 5}, and (6) that there are such properties B and such numbers
a <b that 0 < P {a = x < 4|B} < 1, then x is a random variable in the sense of the
above definition.

The probability P {a = x < }} considered as a function of a and 4 will be called
the integral probability law of x.

A random variable is here contrasted with a constant, say 0, which will be defined
as a magnitude, the numerical values of which corresponding to all elements of the
