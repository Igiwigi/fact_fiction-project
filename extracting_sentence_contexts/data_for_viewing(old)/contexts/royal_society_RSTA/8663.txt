is not zero; 2.e. (see § 2 (iii.)) that there is a set conjugate to P, Q, R, ....]

(VIL) For any particular set of auxiliaries there is one and only one improved
value of A. [This follows from the fact that the equations in (VI.), on the
assumption there stated, have one and only one solution.] Hence we get the
converse of (IIT.) :—

(VIIL) Jf x is the sum of w and a Le. of P, Q, R,..., and if the m.p.e. of x and
each of P, Q, R, ... is zero, then x is the improved value of w, using P, Q, BR, ... as
auxiliaries. As a particular case :—

(IX.) If the mp.e. of w and each of P, Q, R, ... is zero, the improved value of w,
using P, Q, R, ... as auxiliaries, is the same as the original value.

(X.) The improved value of P, using P, Q, R, ... as auxiliaries, is P—P = 0.
[This follows either from (VIII.) or from taking A = P in the equations in (VI.).]
