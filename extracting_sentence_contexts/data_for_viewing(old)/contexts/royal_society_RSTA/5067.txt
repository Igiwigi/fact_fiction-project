to the benefit of the radial/median pattern (figure 142,b). Conversely, as temperature decreases,

E/H as well as v decrease and shear flow becomes less and less significant and eventually
disappears at 77K as observed by Kurkjian et al. [5] in the case of a-SiO2 and a soda-lime-

silica glass, for which the E/H ratio decreases from 8 and 10 to 3 and 6.3, respectively, as T
decreases from room temperature to 77K. Interestingly, as will be discussed in ยง3f, there seems

to be also a correlation between the cone crack angle and v. The concomitant increase of the

E/H ratio results in radial/median cracks to grow on heating in a window glass (figure 14c-e).

As a matter of fact, the soda-lime-silicate glass seems more damaged at 473K than at ambient

(figure 14d) [52]. Nevertheless, viscous flow takes over at higher temperatures, and especially

on approaching Tg which corresponds to a characteristic relaxation time constant of the order

of a minute, i.e. comparable to the time scale of an indentation experiment. In the present case

visible microcracks disappeared in the 723-753 K range (figure 14e,f). A study focused on the
brittle-to-ductile transition in a similar glass showed that ductility appears at temperatures from

723 to 823K as the loading rate increases from approximately 1 MPa.,/ms~! to 10 MPa.,/ms~!
