Similarly the lens polisher knows that his machine tends usually to make surfaces nearly
spherical, but he is guided by interference fringes, which show him how nearly sphericity
has been attained. Instead of an initial proof that one will arrive (proof of convergence)
there is in these, and in many other practical affairs, a final proof that one has arrived (test
of achievement). Why should not similarly skilful operations be considered respectable in
arithmetic ?

H. Iterative computations are not quite limiting operations in the strictest sense; for,
although the computer can always attain greater accuracy by doing more arithmetic, yet
in fact he is usually content with less than twenty significant digits; so that theorems about
infinite accuracy are not required. Here is another resemblance to lens-polishing; for if a
lens is correct to within a tenth of the wave-length of light, that is near enough. 8.
