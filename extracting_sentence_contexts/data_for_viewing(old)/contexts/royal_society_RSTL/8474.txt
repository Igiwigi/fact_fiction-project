that is

1=y__l-z (Q*-1+2(4Q—1)a)*
1+y 1+z ]Q?-1-2(40—1)aſ?

1 __a*+2a8 0+2 N*—4kN+3
a=Q*, and HEE ET MH,

which completes the theory.

13. Reproducing for this case the general theory, it appears & priori that Q is deter-
mined by a quartic equation; in fact from the original equations eliminating Q, we
have an equation

RENE |=0;
where U, U', V, V' are quartic functions of , Þ; that is the ratio «: 4 has four values,
and to each of these there corresponds a single value of Q; viz. Q is determined by a
quartic equation.

14. Considering next the case n=5, the quintic transformation ; the elimination of Q
gives the equations
