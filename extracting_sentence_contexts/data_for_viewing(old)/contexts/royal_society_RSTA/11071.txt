points on a vertical line drawn through 50 give a record of the way in which the
alloy cools and solidifies. Above 850째 it is wholly liquid, but when the crucible has
cooled to this temperature there is an evolution of heat causing the thermometer to
remain stationary for a short time, and we observe the upper freezing point. The
cooling soon recommences, but more slowly than before, and when the temperature has
fallen to 625째 there is another halt. After some time, however, the temperature
again begins to fall, and soon falls rapidly until about 568째 is reached, when an
extremely steady temperature is indicated, and the alloy, if it has not done so before,
sets to a solid mass. These three points are the freezing points of the alloy. They
may, of course, be due to any exothermic changes going on in the crucible, such as
the breaking up of the alloy into conjugate liquids or to allotropic changes; but the
microscope has satisfied us that in the case of gold-aluminium we have only to do with
the separation of solids, in fact, that at each of the three observed points a new
substance begins to solidify.

It will be seen that multiple freezing points, although frequent, are not universal ;
for example, the alloys Au,Al and AuAl, have only one freezing point.

It is important to bear in mind that the diagrams of Curves 2 and 5 give a record of
all the freezing points observed, and contain more information than an ordinary
equilibrium curve. The first, or upper, freezing points of each alloy do indeed
constitute an equilibrium curve, but our lines of second and third freezing points
do not, strictly speaking, belong to the equilibrium curve. For example, the second
freezing point which we mentioned as occurring at 625째 does not represent a state
in which a liquid having the composition Au;)Aljo is in equilibrium with solid. For in
