recommended value for kg, one would retrieve a spectroscopic temperature of 272.649(1) K, rather
than the expected value of 273.16 K.

Going back to figure 1, it is clear that the best A-ratios are provided by oxygen at 687 nm,
followed by acetylene at 788 nm. Being a homonuclear molecule, O2 is not active in the infrared
portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The oxygen molecule has two low-lying excited


electronic states, the a!Agy and b!E,°, which are approximately 7888cm7! and 13122cm™!, Ee
respectively, above the De ground state. Weak magnetic dipole transitions are possible

between these electronic states, even though those from the ground states (X — a and X > b) 3
violate the selection rule on the electronic spin (AS = 0). As a matter of fact, there are a number : a
of rovibronic transitions in the visible and NIR spectral regions, which are characteristic of the ig
absorption spectrum of solar radiation by the Earth’s atmosphere. In particular, the A and B bands : s

(v’ =0— v' =0and v’” =0 > v' = 1, respectively, of the X — a system) present many lines that are
very well isolated and easily accessible by means of commercially available ECDLs. As reported
in table 1, one of them has been proposed for a spectroscopic determination of kg [50].

If the Oz-based implementation is still at the stage of a proposal, there has been already

a test experiment on acetylene at 788nm with a gas pressure ranging from 0.5 to 3Pa (in : &
which the A-ratio is larger than 1000). This experiment yielded spectroscopic measurements of Dos
the gas temperature, with the cell operating at room temperature, with a global uncertainty : =
