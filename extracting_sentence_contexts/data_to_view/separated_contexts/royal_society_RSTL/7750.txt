Chromium. â€”This als exists in combination with oxygen in the chromates and bi-
chromates. There it has a refraction-equiyalent of about 23.

* In cstimating metals from their chlorides, the equivalent 9-9 has been taken where the chloride is decom-
posed by water, 10-7 where it is soluble without decomposition. This arbitrary distinction seems to haye a
foundation in fact. DR. GLADSTONE ON THE REFRACTION-EQUIVALENTS OF THE ELEMENTS. 25

In the oxychloride (Table IIT.) it seems to have about the same power as in the
chromium salts, viz. 16-5.
