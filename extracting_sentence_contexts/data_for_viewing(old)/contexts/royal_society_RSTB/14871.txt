U70 variants showed no change in mCherry fluorescence per
cell in HEK 293T cells (figure 5a,c), similar to our observations
in N2a cells.

(f) Cell-specific cytotoxicity of transfer RNA-dependent

mistranslation

In N2a cells expressing tRNASKq, we observed significant
cytotoxicity induced by Ser mis-incorporation at Phe
codons. By contrast, in HEK 293T cells we found no signifi-
cant change in toxicity in cells expressing tRNAXG, versus
tRNAXK,. The fact that protein synthesis is repressed in
HEK 293T cells expressing tRNAXA, (figure 5a,c) suggests
that mistranslation occurs at a level that does not cause
increased levels of cell death (figure 6a). The data indicate
that the level of RNA-dependent mistranslation or its associ-
ated phenotypic defects may be cell specific. For each of the
tRNAâ€œ and tRNA variants we recorded no changes in
cytotoxicity in HEK 293T cells (figure 6a), similar to our
findings in N2a cells above.
