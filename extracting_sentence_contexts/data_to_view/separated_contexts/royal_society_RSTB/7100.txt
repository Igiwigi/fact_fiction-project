Under oil
immersion it can be seen that whereas at the base of the scale the ridges are running
parallel to the long axis (figure 40, plate 2), they become ‘wavy’ as they pass along
distally (figures 41 and 42, plate 2). The amplitude of the waves increases distally, until
the ridges appear to break up into short segments, jumbled together more or less at random
(figure 43, plate 2). These changes suggest that the ridges have to be accommodated in
a surface of limited area, and that their meandering course is the expression of the fact that
they are continuing to grow in length in a surface already limited by the volume which it
bounds; that is to say, they continued to grow in length after the cylindrical bristle was laid
down. A second example is provided by the androconium of Pieris brassicae, already considered
in another connexion. It is clear from figure 58, plate 3, that the course of the ridges is
intimately connected with the shape of the scale.
