How these truly reflect the
human condition is debatable. Interpreting SCZ like pheno-
types in mice, including complex symptoms such as paranoia
and delusional beliefs, is even more challenging: they can
only be inferred indirectly from disordered mice behaviour, a
major limitation of modelling schizophrenia in animals.

(b) Human in vitro stem cell models: advantages and
limitations

Human iPSC technologies are allowing researchers to interro-
gate human cortical development in health and disease and
provide unlimited platforms of mature neuronal and glial cel-
lular subtypes and co-cultures for downstream studies such as
cellular physiology, phenotypic screening, and for drug

development and screening. Such human iPSC models confer
a number of advantages including the fact that it is possible
to model for both coding and non-coding variants and, in
fact, it is also possible to model for disease without actually
knowing the causal genetic factor [46]. Clearly, though know-
ing the causal/contributory variants confers an advantage to
translational studies and a greater understanding of putative
mechanisms of disease [47]. It is possible to study the effects
of genomic mutations on brain development and in neuropsy-
chiatric disorders using clustered regularly interspaced short
palindromic repeats (CRISPR) gene-editing technologies.
