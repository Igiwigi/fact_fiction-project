Curre and Danner showed that the matter B is much more volatile
than C. The former is completely volatilized at about 600° C., while the latter is
not completely volatilized even at a temperature of 1300° C. The fact that the
matter ©, left behind when B is completely volatilized, decays at once to half value
in 28 minutes shows that the matter C itself and not B is half transformed in
28 minutes. Curte and DANN# also found that the rate of decay of the active matter varied
with the temperature to which the platinum wire had been subjected. At 630° C.
the rate of decay was normal, at 1100° C. the activity fell to half value in about
20 minutes, while at 1300° C. it fell to about half value in about 25 minutes.
