This opens up a new field of
investigation.

} A preliminary investigation of the detailed physical processes that occur during the sliding of
rigidly-held lubricated metallic surfaces has recently been carried out using a cathode ray oscillograph. In the presence of a mineral oil very rapid and violent fluctuations in both the surface temperature and
the contact resistance were observed, often in periods of less than 1/30,000 sec.; with oleic acid some
fluctuations again occurred, but to a less marked extent. These are, in fact, the results that would be
expected if the motion were smoother with oleic acid than with the mineral oil.
