Fourth, the limits of automated processing and technological solutions to solve systemic and
societal problems are often left completely unconsidered. The potential risks and limitations of
data-driven decision-making, and their ethical and social impacts needs to be reconfigured into
a central consideration in India’s AI policy development. The fact that a decision is ‘data-driven’
does not mean it is fair, just, accurate, or appropriate. This will be further elaborated on in the
next section. Fifth, while State use and adoption of AI for law enforcement, defence and national security is
on the rise, policy discussions thus far have neglected to confront the contours within which such
use should occur.
