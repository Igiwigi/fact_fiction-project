The basidorsalia do not carry separate supradorsalia, nor dorso-spinal elements. The absence of such separate elements (and the same applies to the ventral
side) constitutes the only absolute difference between Amphibia and Fishes.

VII. The vertebrae do not possess, and cannot form, neuro-central sutures, because
their bodies are exquisitely arco-centrous, formed, in fact, by the arches
proper, namely, by the basidorsalia and basiventralia, while the interbasalia
produce the neutral, intervertebral mass. Hereby the Amphibia differ from
the Amniota. J, therefore, distinguish the Urodele vertebral bodies as Pseudo-
centra.*
