It is possible to prove that solutions to this problem belong to W?? (By) for any p > 1, and because [=
W?? functions are twice differentiable a.e. when p > 1, one deduces that Au = Ay a.e. on {u =}. a)
Hence, the obstacle problem can be rewritten as :

Au=AWxX{u=y) in Bi, 18

with the additional (global) information u € W??(B}) for all p € (1,00) [1, ch. 1, §3]. Note that [3
because Au jumps from the value zero inside {u > y} to the value AW on {u =}, the second [8
derivatives of u cannot be continuous in general. However, it is possible to prove that u € ch, :sS
and starting from this fact one can show the regularity of the free boundary d{u > yr} [2,3] (see a)

(c) Bernoulli problems
Bernoulli-type problems are free boundary problems with a transition conditions across the free
boundary. The archetype for this class of problems is

min| [Wel? + xjo0) Kix (ve W!2(B): von, =81, 2)
‘1

where g may take both negative and positive values. Solutions to this problem satisfy
Au=0 whenu #40,

with a transition condition on the free boundary {u = 0} that can be derived formally in the case
of a smooth free boundary and reads

(sy — (uy P= 1

Here, us denote the normal derivatives in the inward direction to {--u > 0}, so that us are both
non-negative.
