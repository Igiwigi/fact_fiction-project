From such a type of sorus as that in the Gleicheniacew, where there is a raised
receptacle (GU. dichotoma), but simultaneous origin of the sporangia, to Alsophila,
where there is a basipetal sequence of the sporangia, would be but a slight transition as
regards soral characters. The succession once established, its continuance would be
assured by the physiological advantage gained, while growth of the receptacle in
length, and continued succession of the sporangia, would result in the soral conditions
seen in various extreme types of the Gradatee, where it appears not only in superficial
(Cyatheaceze), but also in marginal sori (Dicksoniexe, Hymenophyllacez).t

From the Gradatz transitional steps have been observed, through the Denn-
stredtiinze, to the mixed sorus, where the sporangia of various ages are in juxta-
position.t These facts, together with comparison of living forms, and the evidence
of paleontology and comparative anatomy, sufficiently demonstrate that the Mixte
are relatively late derivative Ferns. They are the prevalent Ferns of the present day
in point of number of species. They may have arisen by a similar progression from a
number of points, and thus represent a brush of parallel or divergent lines.
