of the buds and development hardly begins until the early spring. That the delay
is due to the inhibiting presence of the parent zooids is shown by the fact that
a piece of test sliced off from a sexually mature summer colony and containing only
ampullae of the stolonic vessels is able to develop into new zooids at once. As in
other species of Clavelina, epidermis forms new epidermis, the proliferating cells of
the vascular septum give rise to all the other tissues of the new individual, and the
trophocytes serve as nutrient matter. The zooids developing from the incompletely
regressed zooids are at first much larger than those from the stolonic ampullae.
