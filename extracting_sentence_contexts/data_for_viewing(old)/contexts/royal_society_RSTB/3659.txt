* The great size of the fractures, and the consequent tremendous force of the blows which produced
them, is a marked characteristic of much of the “Icenian ” flint industry. I also desire to emphasize the
occurrence of these large surfaces of fracture forming nearly perfect planes at right angles to one another.
I have just received a newly found Sub-Crag implement which shows three planes of fracture forming
parts of three faces of a cube, the edges of these planes which meet one another being clean-cut, nearly
straight lines. Possibly the fine quality of the flint used is accountable, to some extent, for this
astonishing workmanship.—March 9, 1912,


328 SIR RAY LANKESTER ON THE DISCOVERY OF A NOVEL TYPE OF FLINT

One of the most important features about the Sub-Crag industry, and in fact one
which establishes it as a very independent manifestation of human activity—more
ancient than any of the river gravels and similar deposits containing the foliiform
“coups de poing” and ‘“amygdaloids”—is the total absence from it of such
foliiform (flattened) implements. Zhe Sub-Crag industry is characterised by the
presence of the rostro-carinate or “ eagle’s-beak” implements, found nowhere else at
present, and by the total absence of forms of the lance-head or pick-like Chellian,
Acheuilian and Moustierian types and of any forms transitional to or from those
types.*
