Protopteridophyta. The view that the strobiloid type is the fundamental one harmonises with the
anatomical facts. The non-medullated protostele is generally accepted by anatomists
as the primitive arrangement in the axis; it is found still among the Lycopods,
persistent in the mature individual. But even large-leaved Ferns of most complex
mature structure, such as the Marattiacese, show a single solid protostele in the
young plant.
