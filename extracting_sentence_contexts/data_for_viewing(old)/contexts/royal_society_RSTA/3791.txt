wavelength is observed with respect to the transmittance dip. Such spectral shifts have been :8
already demonstrated in previous nonlinear spectroscopy research [31,32]. They can be attributed :3
both to dispersion of the material at the TH wavelength and to the fact that the local fields are :3

not necessarily at their maximum at the transmittance dip; the latter statement is supported
numerically below. The maximum enhancement is defined as a ratio of the normalized THG
signal (the THG intensity from the discs, located on the substrate, divided by the THG intensity
from the substrate, i.e. |Edise + Est 2 (ES2> |) to the inverse value of the relative nanodisc area
4p? /xd being around 30, which is consistent with our previous findings for sparsely arranged
oligomers [28].

In order to elucidate the observed asymmetry in the efficiencies between the THG at the
magnetic resonance versus that at the electric resonance, we calculate numerically the volume-
integrated local electromagnetic fields within the disc. It is known that the nonlinear polarization
depends strongly on the strength of the local electromagnetic field; in the case of the scalar
