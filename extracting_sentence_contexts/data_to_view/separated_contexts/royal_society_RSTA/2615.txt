It was shown that lubricin was able to lubricate non-cartilaginous
surfaces as effectively as whole synovial fluid in the boundary mode. Thus, the lubricant contacts
an organic surface already impregnated with water (static and dynamic peculiarities in the
wetting of impregnated surfaces will be discussed later in detail). In spite of the fact that the
physics of lubrication inherent for cartilage is not completely understood, artificial lubricants
mimicking natural ones have already been reported [20]. Poly (vinylalcohol) (PVA) hydrogel with
high water content was reported as a bio-mimicking candidate material for artificial cartilage
[20]. The design and manufacture of artificial articular cartilage is an extremely challenging
engineering task, requiring consideration of optimal lubrication (tribology) and wear aspects
[21,22].
