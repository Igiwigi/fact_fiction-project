Clifford [18] were the first to provide direct evidence for this,
by showing that the degree of motion—colour asynchrony
can be reduced or increased by changing the angular difference
in the direction of motion that is to be paired with colour. More
recently, this has been shown to be true even within a single
attribute, that of visual motion [19]. No asynchrony is detected
in pairing experiments in which subjects are asked to pair up—
down motion presented in one half of their field of view with
left-right motion presented in the other half [9]. However,
when asked to pair up-down motion with up-right motion,
a temporal advantage in favour of up—right motion emerges.

This can be accounted for by the fact that there is much less 4, Temporal hierarchies in visual processing

attributes distributed across space (that is across the two
hemi-fields, when the images would be projected to the
two hemispheres separately). Now, motion—motion pairings
take temporal precedence over colour—colour pairings which,
in turn, take precedence over colour—motion pairings [24].
This may seem surprising, given the precedence in perceiving
colour over motion, but is explicable by a difference in the
conduction velocities of the fibres that unite areas V4 and V5,
specialized for colour and motion respectively, in one
hemisphere with their counterparts in the other; the interhemi-
spheric connections of V5 are mediated by larger myelinated
