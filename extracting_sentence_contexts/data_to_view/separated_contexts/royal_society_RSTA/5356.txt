Also displayed will be the following data, where the numbers included are entirely a figment of
my imagination!

— Results found: 15 (the total number of papers that you have published)

— Sum of the times cited: 254 (the total number of citations to all your papers)

— Sum of times cited without self-citations: 244 (with 10 self-citations subtracted!)
— Citing articles 157 (those articles which have made the citations to your work)
— Citing articles without self-citations: 150 (with self-citing articles subtracted)

— Average citations per item: 254/15 = 16.9

— The h-index: 3 (described in the following section)

Note that there is a facility for viewing the specific articles (by other authors) that have cited
your work via your university’s database links. Finally, there will be the list of all your papers
with very comprehensive citation information about each paper. Sorting the papers by selecting
‘Times cited—highest to lowest’ you will find a horizontal orange line underneath one of them
which corresponds to the h-index that I describe next.

(b) The h-index of solidity

Let us consider the fictional Jane Smith, a talented post-doc whose citation histogram is shown in
figure 13. This shows the citations of her individual papers, which are listed in decreasing numbers
of citations. Jane may have more than 17 publications (30, say), but those beyond 17 have no
citations.
