Yet, the rate of
discovery of metazoan OTUs with the V9 region of the 18S

To further illustrate the limitations of 18S for censusing rRNA gene is beginning to plateau after 448 samples

effort conducted in the ocean for metazoans, with 448 probably driven by low levels of variability of the V9 region.


(d) Paucity of reference barcode data in public
databases

While representative barcode sequences are available across
most of the branches of the tree of life (however, see [16] for
protists), the lack of coverage at lower taxonomic levels cur-
rently hinders interpretation of metabarcoding data. Most
OTUs remain identified to taxonomic groups that have limited
taxonomic and functional relevance in biodiversity inven-
tories, ecological studies or monitoring initiatives. For
example, very few metazoan OTUs in the 18S V9 circumglobal
plankton dataset matched sequences of the Protist Ribosomal
Reference (PR2 [18]) database with levels of sequence similarity
typical of genus-level matches (2.7% with more than 99%
similarity, figure 2b and table 1) (see [102] for threshold justifi-
cation).
