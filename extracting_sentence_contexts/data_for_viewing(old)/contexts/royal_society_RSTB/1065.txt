In Cirripede groups other than Thoracica a,similar mode of origin occurs: Van
BENEDEN (58) has already described the same thing in Sacculina, and I have observed

it myself in Peltogaster. A similar disposition of the Nauplius appendages in Laura

has caused Lacaze-Durarers (38) to state that the appendages are attached on the

dorsal side, a peculiarity he specially emphasizes. The attachment is, I believe,
ventral as usual, but the free ends are dorsally directed, the position of the embryo

having been inverted by this observer.

It seems very probable that the same fact obtains in the Nauplii of all the other

groups.
In the Phyllopods the figures
“ Sowohl die beiden Antennen a

of Gropsen make this clear, and he states, for Moina,

Js die Mandibel wachsen von jnnen nach aussen.”
