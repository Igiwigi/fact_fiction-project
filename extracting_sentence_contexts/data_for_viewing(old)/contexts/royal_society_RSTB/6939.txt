possible to discuss the probable stages by which the mammalian palate was derived
from one similar to those of the advanced Theriodont reptiles, and to discuss these
changes from the functional aspect. This section is much more hypothetical, and is
offered as a basis for future discussion.

II. THE VOMER PROBLEM

(1) Historical account

Until towards the end of the last century morphologists had little hesitation in
homologizing the mammalian vomer with the “paired vomers”’ of amphibians and
reptiles. This was a natural interpretation in view of the relations of these bones and
the fact that the ‘‘ paired vomers”’ of reptiles may fuse and even support a false palate
(Ghelonia, Crocodilia).

The vomer of a mammal typically shows the following relations in the fully formed
skull. It is a median element separating the true internal nares; it touches the
premaxillae anteriorly, is clasped by the palatines posteriorly, and may touch the
pterygoids; it lies antero-ventrally to the presphenoid region, and is normally quite
anterior to the basisphenoid. Dorsally it clasps the nasal septum and ventrally
extends towards the false palate.

The “paired vomers”’ of such a typical reptile as the lizard lie between the internal
nares; they touch the premaxillae anteriorly, and are broadly in contact with the
palatines postero-laterally; in unspecialized Reptilia they touch the pterygoids; they
