The two series of observations 1 and 2 represent the action of
single and double cells or thicknesses of 4 and 14 inch respectively. It is particularly
sbriking how the second series of observations shows a regular decrease in transmitted
rays caused by each increment of CH, in the molecule. The same fact is again noticeable in Diagram No. 3, Plate 23. Here, in order to get
rid of the inconvenience caused by the change of alkaline formates into oxalates on
evaporation, we made use of very beautiful specimens of barium salts. In this case
the formate is.
