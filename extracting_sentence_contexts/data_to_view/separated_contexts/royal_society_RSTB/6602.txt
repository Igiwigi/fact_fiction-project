The
sulcus parallelus superioris (24) is the branched sulcus which is directed forwards
towards the angle between the sulcus postcentralis inferior and the pars horizontalis. Comparing this specimen with C.2.L., it is apparent that it is in the supramarginal
gyrus that the difficulties of interpretation are most apparent. In fact, in identifying
the sulci in this region by means of numbers, it is to be pointed out that these
numbers cannot bear the same implications in each brain. The difficulties of
homology are of the same order as those found in identifying such sulci as the sulcus
paramedialis. In $.13.R. in which the distance between the lower end of the sulcus centralis and
the posterior end of the fissure of Sylvius is short, the complicated nature of the
sulci of the supramarginal region is accentuated and further confirmation is added
to the opinion that it is in the supramarginal region of the Australian that the first
expansions of the inferior parictal lobule take place.
