su!phur was stated by Mr. BexzeLi1vs and myself, in our joint paper, to be only
7-36 inches, instead of 10,75 ; but this difference is accounted for from the circum-
stance of the temperature, which in that instance was 535%, instead of 669; a differ-
ence which is very nearly that which might have been expected from a comparison
with the force of ether at the same temperature as given in Mr. DaLTon's tables.

the effects just related,‚Äù The fact is, that all these attempts
have hitherto failed, and the simplest mode of performing the
experiment has uniformly yielded the best results. Indeed, I
am now inclined to believe, that unless a substance were found
which should exert an attraction upon the sulphureous liquors
without being itself evaporable, (as is the case with the sul-
phuric acid, in Mr. LesLit's mode of freezing water), I have
nearly reached the limit of cold that can be produced in this
manner. It may be proper to add, that the presence of sul-
phuric acid in this experiment would have no immediate effect,
as it exerts no attraction upon the volatilized liquor ; yet by
drying the rarefied atmosphere which surrounds the bulb, it
might perhaps assist a little in promoting the process of eva-
