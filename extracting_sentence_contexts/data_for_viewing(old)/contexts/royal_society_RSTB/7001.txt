The form of the stalks and their mode of connexion with the colonies is incorrectly shown
in some of Stein’s figures (1878, plate III, figure v), which have often been copied. Stein
depicts rather solid stalks of almost uniform thickness, even at the top where the colonies
are attached. Actually the upper parts of the stalks are frail and pale, and often difficult
to detect. Between the older brown branches and the top of the stalks, the colour gradually
fades, as mentioned already by Cohn (1853, p. 110) and Molisch (1910, p. 57). Owing to
their delicate nature the tops of the stalks readily break and get carried away with the
escaping colonies. The stalks are flexible (cf. p. 314) so that the attached colonies move gently
to and fro under the action of the flagella (Saville Kent 1881-2, p. 267).

These facts were established with the help of the micro-chambers described on p. 321,
which also made it possible to study the origin of the stalks. After a swarmer has settled
on the cover-slip, it gives rise to an irregular cluster of a few cells, which multiply to form
colonies (figures 5, 6). By mutual pressure of the cells the colonies :
