In an older larva of about 5:5 centims. the pronephros did not exhibit any marked
- 8igns of atrophy, though the duct between it and the mesonephros was somewhat
reduced and gurrounded by the trabecular tisxue spoken of in connexion with the
adult. In the region between the pronephros and the front end of the fully developed
part of the mesonephros very rudimentary tubules had become established.
The latest stage of the excretory system which we have studied is in a young Fish
of about 11 centims. in length. The special interesb of this stage depends upon the

fact that the ovary is already developed, and not only 0, but the formation of
oviducts has commenced, and their condition at this stage throws considerable 1;
on the obscure problem of their nature in the Ganoids. ;

Unfortunately, the head of the young Fish had been removed before it was put, int |
our hands, 80 that i was impossible for us to determine whether the pronephros was +
still present ; but as we shall subsequently show, the section of the 8egmental duct,
originally present between the pronephros and the front end of the permanent kidney T
or mesonephros, has in any case disappeared. S |

In addition to an examination of the excretory organs in situ, which showed little i
except the presence of the generative ridges, we made a complete xeries of sectiong |
through the excretory organs for their whole length (Plate 26, figs. 54-57). i
