rather upon the different effects produced by the same nerve in consequence of varia-
tions in the condition of nutrition of the heart as a whole—variations of nutrition
to which naturally the more delicately-organized ganglion cells would prove more
sensitive than the comparatively coarser muscular fibres.

How, then, can we imagine to ourselves the action of the nerve upon the heart? In

Q the firs place, it is clear thab the nerve cannot be considered as the motor nerve of
>the muscle in the sense in which the words motor nerve are ordinarily used. The
;Z nerve itself cannot upon stimulation cause a contraction of the cardiac muscle ; but
SE causes 8uch a modification in the chemical processes going on in the muscle as to
£ modify the force of the contractions which take place when the impulses from the
Emotor ganglia reach the muscle. In fact, two distinct processes are going on—the one,
Smotor, represented by the impulses from the motor ganglia, and corresponding to the
Z blow by which snch an explosive substance as nitro-glycerine, for instance, is exploded ;
= the other, trophic, represented by the action of the vagus upon the muscular sub-
B 8tance, and corresponding to something affecting the nature or properties of the
Sexploaive substance itself.
'> The problem, then, to be explained is, what conception can be formed of the nature
= of the changes caused in the muscle by the action of the nerve, which shall satisfy the
2 conditions that the same nerve can produce in different cases a graduated series of
= different effects extending from a simple increase in the force of the contractions on
E S'the one side down to diminution of force even to complete standstill on the other ?
In trying to form a theory to explain new facts, it is always advisable to see if any
& theory which has been devised to explain somewhat similar facts will apply to this case
