Therefore, if it happens that (3.5) holds for this system, then one has a true
contradiction on one’s hands, and this contradiction cannot be resolved within the framework
of (3.3). It can only be resolved by explicating and rejecting some hidden assumptions—and in
this case the culprit is the assumption that the random variables measuring the same content in
different contexts are the same. This problem is ubiquitous in the traditional literature succeeding [7], although its critical
analysis is complicated by the fact that many authors would refer to elements of (3.3) as
measurements or observables rather than random variables. I take it as a given, however, that the
notion of a distribution of R;, or the probability of R; being equal to some value, can only be used
if R; is a random variable. With this in mind, the contradiction just described can only be resolved
by using contextual notation, and CbD offers a straightforward way of doing this.
