electricity therefore really exist, upon the interior surface of the sphere, it conld not,
if the theory be true, be imparted to a body placed wholly within it. The experi-
ment therefore is in this point of view irrelevant ; but if we take the experiment as a
mere fact abstracted from hypotheses, it must necessarily be considered in connexion
with other facts, such as those above stated (31.) (32.); in either case, however, it is
clearly no evidence of the non-existence of electricity upon the interior surface of a
charged shell.

34. The experiments last mentioned (L.), (M.) are instructive ; they show that it is
not only from the absence of electricity upon the interior surface of a charged shell
that we fail to electrify a small insulated body placed within it, but that this result
may also arise from incapacity of the given body itself to take up electricity under
certain cireumstances. Pursuing therefore these facts, unfettered by any hypothetical
view of electricity, we are immediately led to examine under what conditions one
body can receive electricity by communication from another, as in the case of touching
a charged conductor with a small insulated disc of inconsiderable thickness ; since

upon the indications of this instrument, termed a proof plane, all the experimental
evidence of the theory of electrical distribution in charged bodies of various forms
depends.
