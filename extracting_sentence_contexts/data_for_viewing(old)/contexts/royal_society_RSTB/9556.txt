called XIRAF [21]. As the amount of data is expanding expo-
nentially each year, a scalable solution for processing the data
is needed [22]. This XIRAF approach has been shown to
reduce the case backlog by helping the end-user understand
the digital material in a timely fashion. Forensic procedures in
use today place the burden of providing relevant digital evi-
dence in the domain of the digital investigator, as well as
maintaining the digital analysis and storage equipment and
finally providing in-depth knowledge on the origin of the
digital traces found. The implementation of an automated
analysis framework shifts the task of finding relevant digita’
traces from the digital investigator to the tactical investigator,
who has more knowledge of the facts and circumstances sur-
rounding the case. In this way, the digital investigator can put
all his knowledge and education into supporting the tactica’
investigator with interpretation of the digital traces found, as
is illustrated in figure 1. Evidence from various law enforce-
ment agencies have shown that investigations in any urban
population of roughly 15 million people generate between 4
and 20 PB of data to be analysed annually, with on average
4 TB of data per case. XIRAF presents all the data from a
case in one overall view of the digital devices pertaining to
the case. The investigator then applies queries to the data in
order to reduce the set of traces. However, the XIRAF
approach reached its limits at 1 PB of raw data, and a more
