THE SOURCES OF THE NITROGEN OF VEGETATION, ETC. 447

But another and potent reason for investigating the relation of plants to the free or
uncombined Nitrogen of the atmosphere is to be found in the fact, that the question
has, of late years, been submitted to an immense amount of research by numerons
