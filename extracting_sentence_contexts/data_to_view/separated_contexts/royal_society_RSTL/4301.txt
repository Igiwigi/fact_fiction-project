On making a horizontal section
amongst the lower lamellze, 30 Â«a, we find that the numerous lacunz are of the com-
mon ichthyal type, only they are more than usually crowded together, as well as
anastomose more freely through their spider-like lacunze. No canals of any kind
pass through the tissue. These facts of course do away with all probability of this ano-
malous viscus having been a stomach ; according to Dr. ManTELL, to whom we are
indebted for the discovery of this singular creature, the broad anterior extremity of
the cylinder is always open, and situated opposite the posterior margin of the oper-
cular bone, whilst its caudal termination is as invariably closed. I am disposed to believe that it has been an organ fulfilling the functions of an
air-bladder.
