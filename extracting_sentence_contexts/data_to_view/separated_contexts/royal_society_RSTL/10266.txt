The same may be eaid of Mz, which I
received from Dr. ALpeR WRIGHT. SZ $ 53. The absolute variations with temperature of (1), (10), (39), (40) are shown
Sin Table XV., in which all the electro-motive forces are expressed in terms of (38)
Eat 51* F., a s8mall correction being introduced to allow for the 1? or 2®, by which the
Factual temperature of (38), (35), may have differed from 51%, The coefficients for (1)
- and (10) are almost identical. The observed values for (1) agree pretty well with the
formula '
*9970{1 —©000425(t—57)},

as will be seen from the adjoining column calculated therefrom. This is in
Fahrenheit degrees.
