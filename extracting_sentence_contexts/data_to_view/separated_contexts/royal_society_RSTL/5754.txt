The natural inference would therefore seem to be, that the eggs will find theix
way through these passages, which may consequently be looked upon as oyiducts,

'These curious organs were originally described by CUyIER as hearts, in his well-known
memoir on Lingula anatina', and subsequently by Professor OwEy in the Brachiopoda
generally, in his equally celebrated paper * On the Ariatomy of the Brachiopoda,‚Äù pub-
lished in the 'Transactions of the Zoological Society?. And up to the present time these
organs are generally considered as the blood-propelling instruments. 'They open, how-
ever, as before stated, externally, and therefore can have nothing to do with the vascular
system. Any one who has the opportunity, and will take the necessary pains, may satisfy
himself of this fact ; but he nust not be discouraged by a failure or two, for unless the
specimens be in excellent condition, he will find the determination of even this simple
point attended with considerable difficulty. The epithelium, which is very deciduous and
brittle in spirit-specimens, is liable to be crumpled in the vicinity of the external orifices. It is consequently a matter of no little nicety, under such circumstances, to ascertain if
the openings pass through the epithelium.
