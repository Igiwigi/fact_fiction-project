(a) Fixed polar vortices

We start by observing that in the case of total vorticity equal to zero it is not possible to have a
stable ring at the equator (i.e. z} = 0 or, equivalently, 0, = 1/2), independently of the number of
vortices N. In fact in this case, it follows from equations (7.1) and (6.2) that the linearized reduced
system is

with 4s; =(/—1)(N—j+1)>0 for j=2,...,N. This implies linear instability and it is clearly
shown in figure 6, where all curves delimitating the stability zone (to the right of the
corresponding curve) never cross the line 6; =2/2. For values of z; 40, as discussed in the
previous section, if the vortices are held fixed at the poles we have the following corollary of
theorem 6.2:

Corollary 7.1 (two fixed polar vortices with total vorticity equal to zero). In the case of a system
