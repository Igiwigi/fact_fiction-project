In the case of a metal, the
average time taken for a hole in the conduction band to move from one atom to the
next is of the order of 10-! sec. Since the radiation time is at least 10-'-10-"? sec.,
the probability that a hole will have moved away is great. But there is a certain
probability that it will stay during the emission period, and this is increased on account
of the fact that if the hole happens to occur near the bottom of the band, it will move
relatively slowly. We think that this mechanism is sufficient to account for the very
weak short wave-length tails. In the case of insulators, stronger tailing to short wave-
lengths is observed, but this radiation seems to end more or less abruptly, and is almost
certainly genuine radiation belonging to the band itself.
