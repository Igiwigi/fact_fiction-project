The external cusps, the paracone and metacone, are also circular at their bases, but
have distinct fore and aft ridges. Of these ridges the anterior one on the paracone is
not much developed, and runs towards the paracone to join it low down. The posterior
ridge of the metacone runs to the cingulum. The two ridges between the paracone
and metacone run, one down each cusp, slightly outwards to meet each other, the
four ribs making a somewhat flat and not quite symmetrical W. At the junction of
the middle pair of ribs a small crest runs straight out to the external cingulum, a clear
foreshadowing of a small mesostylar loop, whose supposed absence has been considered
as a generic character.

The cingulum is well marked, but is thinner on the inner side at the base of the
protocone and hypocone. The parastyle is moderately prominent, but the original
figures are quite misleading in this respect, owing perhaps to the fact that in the type
specimen it has been worn away on all the teeth except the fourth molar of the right
side.

The Premolar Teeth.

Of the premolars, neither the type specimen nor the Cambridge one has the first
premolar preserved, and of the second it is only possible to say that it was an elongated
tooth with a larger anterior and a smaller posterior cusp placed in line with one another
on the outer side of the tooth. On the inner side there is a small postero-internal shelf
surrounded by a low cingulum.* The third and fourth premolars are, in general
appearance, very similar to one another except in size. They have the usual five
cusps, of which the two external ones have ribs like those on the para- and metacones
