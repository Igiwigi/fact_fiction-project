— treat low-concentration/trace high-impact contaminants, such as hormones derived from
excreted contraceptive hormones and other endocrine disruptors;

— recover high-value resources, such as precious metals (e.g. platinum) derived from street
wash-off originating from catalytic converters of vehicles;

— transform the high-organic-component wastewaters to renewable energy in the form of
microbial methane generation or bioplastics; and —

— reduce current dependence on centralized national water supply grids and introduce the iS
ability for more localized self-sufficiency. 13

A few striking facts highlight some of these challenges and the urgent need for new aoe
technologies to maintain water quality in the face of modern-day needs. Perhaps the most :
alarming are plummeting sperm counts, which some research suggests have halved in the past 78
50 years. This is attributed, in part at least, to the ineffectiveness of current sewage treatment [8
processes to remove the remnants of contraceptive pills excreted in urine [1,2]. The same hormone :
contaminants have been attributed to the increased cases of prostate cancer [3,4]. Similarly,
increasing incidence of Parkinson’s disease has recently been attributed to the occurrence of
industrial solvents in aquifers providing potable water [5,6].

Added to the concerns of unintentional contamination is the increasing realization that the
national water supply grid is dependent upon a relatively few strategically vital pumping
stations, which play a critical role in distributing essential supplies. Targeted debilitation of
these stations would disrupt supplies to the millions currently entirely dependent on the
