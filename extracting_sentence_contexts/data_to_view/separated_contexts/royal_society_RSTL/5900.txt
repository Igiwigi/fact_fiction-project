But in a digester of '
copper, the different parts of the vessel are, owing to the high conductivity of the metal,
maintained at s0 uniform a temperature as to prevent any s8uch distillation and cirey-
lation of the liquid from taking place. Regarding the body described above as a mere mixture of zincmethyl and ether,
incapable of being separated on account of the close proximity of their boiling-points, T
anticipated a more successful result by mixing the iodide of methyl with methylic ether
instead of vinic ether. As methylic ether boils, according to BERTHELOT, at —21* C., it
was thought that no such difficulty of separation could arise ; the bodies employed would:
then, in fact, be exactly homologous with those s0 successfully used in the preparation of
pure zincethyl on the large scale. It was found that iodide of methyl, mixed with oxide
of methyl, was readily attacked by zinc, even at the temperature of the water-bath ; the
following experiment was therefore made. About three ounces by measure of iodide of methyl were placed in the copper digester
with the usual quantity of zinc; oxide of methyl, well dried by passing over chloride of
calcium, was forced into the digester by a compression pump * until it was thought that
the volume of liquified ether would be about equal to that of the iodide employed.
