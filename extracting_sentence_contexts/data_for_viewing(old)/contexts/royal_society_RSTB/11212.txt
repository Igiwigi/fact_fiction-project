to spawning areas in the upper watershed, some as far as
3200km from the ocean, tend to enter the river earlier
than individuals from populations spawning lower in the
watershed [79]. In general, salmon enter the river in
discrete stock-specific pulses, which might be the result of
social coordination [70], and by knowing the travel rates of
individuals, managers can choose to target or avoid these

groups by opening or closing different parts of the river
system [80].

Management based on collective movement dynamics has,
in fact, a long history. Traditional knowledge from Inuit people
suggests that caribou migrations are led by a certain set of
female caribou [81-83]. As a result, traditional hunting prac-
tices avoid harvesting the lead animals, since those cows are
understood to be responsible for both ensuring a healthy
migration and also leading the caribou to specific sites year
after year, where they could be harvested [82,84]. Evidence is
only anecdotal, but perhaps the recent shift in migration
routes away from communities, which were established at tra-
ditional hunting sites, is in part linked to harvesting outside of
these guidelines by less experienced hunters [82,83,85].
