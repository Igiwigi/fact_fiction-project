Using the Hilbert series of Rn, we may then rewrite the above sum as

=HSr,(q_“)

Note that we use the fact (from theorem 3.3) that for 0 <i < (2g — 2)/3, we have

i w prden-i
in = Ry @Q Qe = Reet” (My n,z,7 Qe)-

For the second part, we let P(z) be the generating function for the partition numbers p(j), and
let Q(z) :=>¢ (ai be the generating function whose jth coefficient is the number of multisets
of size j on n elements. Then

HS, (2) = Qn(2*)P(2’).

In particular
