330 CAPTAIN ELLIOT'S MAGNETIC SURVEY OF THE INDIAN ARCHIPELAGO.

Ssity. Sambooanga and Nicobar are about forty miles north of the line of no dip.

The angle which the line of least intensity makes with the meridian is nearly a

right angle. eq)
Lines of Variation.

The first attempt which I made to determine the lines of equal variation was un-
Satisfactory. From 120 equations of condition combined by the method of least
s$quares, I obtained results quite at variance with the actual fact.

I then broke up the obseryations into three groups, one to the extreme west, com-
prising the observations taken in Sumitra, one in the centre comprising the observa-
tions taken in Java, and the third group to the east. The results thus obtained are
more satisfactory, for the line of equal variation in the longitudes and latitudes over
which the Survey extended is a straight line for a very short distance only.

Ist, or Eastern group :â€”

At a mean latitude. . . . . . . = 2 03 North.
At a mean longitude . . . . . . =113 53 East.
And mean variation . . . . . . = 1 23 East.
