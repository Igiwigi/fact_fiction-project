D. M. 8S. WATSON ON THE ACANTHODIAN FISHES 125

The jaws of Acanthodians are remarkable for the fact that in all of them the lower
jaw is longer than the upper, exactly as the ventral part of each of the other visceral
arches is longer than its dorsal end. The jaws are also remarkable because both upper
and lower may be, and presumably at some stage of development always were, formed
of two cartilages which, as Reis and JAEKEL have shown, are directly comparable with
the corresponding elements of the branchial arches. (The bone supporting the otic
process of the palato-quadrate in Acanthodes is probably a neomorph.) It is improbable
that the palato-quadrate of Climatius had any articulation with the neural cranium,
but a palato-basal and an otic articulation exist in later forms. The branchial arches have the primitive gnathostome four-part structure.
