Migration as a complex of interacting factors

Locust students have not, on the whole, been attracted by the ‘passive’ theory of migra-
tion, for they have adequate evidence against it, despite the clear evidence of the wind’s
importance in long-range locust migrations. They have been even less attracted by the
‘active’ theory of goal-directed migration, and have emphasized its complete incompati-
bility with their evidence. But they have not hitherto produced any general theory in place
of those they reject, although the material at their disposal is richer in quantity and quality
than the material on any other group of insect migrants. Gunn et al. (1948, pp. 43-44) have
even gone so far as to say:

‘The plain fact is that these gregarious locusts migrate in swarms and nothing is known
of the causes.’

This was, perhaps, a deliberately exaggerated statement made in order to counter the
speculative approach of Heape (1931). But what it implies is that the whole matter is
extremely complex, and the best policy is to wait until all the multifarious factors have
been unravelled. A preliminary attempt to do that has been made in this and the preceding
part. The conclusion is that we are not, after all, dealing with a complex system of ‘inter-
acting factors’. In essence, the system is simple.

However fluid and complex the migrations and however many factors might be involved,
it was known that order did emerge from the chaos, as a recognizable pattern of trends
bearing some relation to seasonal winds. It was plain from everyday observations on
