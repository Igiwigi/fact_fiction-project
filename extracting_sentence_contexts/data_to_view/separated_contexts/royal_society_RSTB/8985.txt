Previous analyses have
taken a similar approach in the analysis of threat status, but instead
converting the threat to a binary variable before the regression
analysis [17]. This has the disadvantage that information on the
ordinal nature of the IUCN scale is ignored. Our analysis, however,
retained the continuous information in the model fitting: for
example, we account for the fact that a species classified as cat-
egory 5 (Critically Endangered) is more at risk than a species in
category 3 (Vulnerable). To produce these threat probabilities, we calculated the prob-
ability that each species was threatened or not from the
predictions of IUCN status. This was simply done by calculating

where Z() is the cumulative z (standardized normal) distribution,
yP4 is the predicted value and gis its standard deviation.
