the balances of configurational actions from a unique source. Pertinent details also appear
below.

Rigid-body-type changes in observers pertain to the first set in the list above of sources
of balance equations. The second set involves non-rigid changes in observers so that the
word covariance appears repeatedly. Its typical occurrence is in N6ther’s theorem, based
on the requirement of invariance of the Lagrangian density with respect to the action of
families of diffeomorphisms on both spatial and referential coordinates. In the last case,
the one involving the referential shape, the diffeomorphisms considered must be volume
preserving if we want that two different observers perceive the same type of material, as
already recalled, irrespectively of whether we are thinking of solids or fluids. Classes of
changes in observers and those of admissible motions are not necessarily coincident, in
fact, as it is well known from elementary courses.

Besides the Lagrangian format in the conservative setting, we can describe motions
in terms of the Hamiltonian, either through the Hamilton equations or to their weak
form represented by the Poisson brackets, which can be supplemented by appropriate
dissipative brackets where there are effects that can be associated with a dissipation
potential (e.g. [40,41]), as a sort of counterpart of the d’Alembert-Lagrange principle.

a dissipation potential, covariance appears in Marsden-Hughes’s theorem [10]. In its
original version, the theorem refers to finite-strain elastodynamics of simple bodies. “3
