The said structure might represent an encumbrance when trying to reach the pointing
stability required by transit observations and certainly might limit the ability to move and repoint
agilely from one target to another in the sky. Note that a factor of 10 in SNR might not be sufficient
in any case to observe the atmospheres of Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars. For those
targets, in fact, transits are expected to occur once per year, and 5-6 transits (assuming a mission
lifetime of approx. 5 years) will not be enough to collect the required photons. Direct imaging from space is the expected next step to be taken in space after transit. Space
telescopes with various types of coronagraphs are being studied in the USA, Europe and Japan
[108-114].
