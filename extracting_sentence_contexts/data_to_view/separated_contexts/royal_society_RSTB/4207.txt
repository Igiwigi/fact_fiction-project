Pétersbourg,’ vol. 17,
Part 3, p. 8, Plate 3, fig. 6. Remarks on the Figured Specimen.—This is a rare species in Britain, not at
present to be distinguished with as much clearness as might be desired from
S. rugosa, and perhaps other species. The present specimen (Plate 4, fig. 17) differs
from Bronenrart's figure (see above) in the upper margin of the leaf-scar being
markedly emarginate, and in the fact that the lateral grooves, arising from the lateral
angles of the leaf-scar, disappear a short distance below the scar, and are not
continued downwards as far as the scar below, as is the case apparently in BroNGNIARt’s
specimen. Neglecting GoLDENBERG’s figure, we have next that of ZEILLER (see above),
in which the same differences are observable. I am, nevertheless, inclined to regard
the present specimen as a variety of |S.
