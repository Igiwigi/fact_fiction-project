The conclusion to be drawn is, I think, that any impulse of the nature of sound, or
of any other nature, causes a disturbed transverse layer to start from the orifice of an
air-jet ; that this layer increases in area as it advances with the jet, the ratio of the
pressure at its centre to the pressure ab its cireumference becoming continually
smaller ; and that the impact of a snccession of these disturbances against a hearing
orifice or a flame gives rise to a sound whose constituent vibrations are copies of the
disturbing vibrations. The foregoing experiments supply an explanation of the fact that very little sound
results when a vibrating jet plays into free air or into a large hearing-tube. Under
these circumstances the diminutions in velocity along the jet axis, due to its vibrations,
are balanced by the excesses along its outer portions, an almost complete interference
ensuing when the jet breaks, But this interference is prevented when the jet strikes
upon an edge or a perforated plate, in fact upon any arrangement which divides the
stream into two parts, and gound is the result, A flame probably acts in this way ;
for inspection shows that while it is emitting sound there is no combustion at the
centre of the plane of impact, but very active combustion at the circumference. This region of active combustion under the best conditions takes the form of a
ring, and the explanation of the loud sounds proceeding from it is to be found in
rapid changes in the rate of combustion. The occurrence of such changes may be
easily proved.
