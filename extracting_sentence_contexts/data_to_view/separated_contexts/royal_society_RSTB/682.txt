The peri-
pheral cells of fig. 1 are somewhat larger than the more central ones; and many of
both have also undergone secondary meristemic subdivisions. Hence whatever may
be its physiological significance, the not unfrequent recurrence of such an active
meristemic condition of the medullary cells of ZL. Harcourtii is a fact that must be
accepted. Is it possible to accept this truth without admitting the correlate one that
a medulla, the cells of which were from time to time so extensively multiplied in
number, must simultaneously have undergone a corresponding increase of its diameter,
and that such an enlargement would inevitably involve a similar increase in the
diameter of its investing primary tracheal cylinder? Accurate measurements of these
central organs at various stages of the plantâ€™s growth became important in their
bearing upon this question.
