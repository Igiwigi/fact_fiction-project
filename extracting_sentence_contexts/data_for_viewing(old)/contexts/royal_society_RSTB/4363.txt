322 DR. J. H. MUMMERY ON NERVE-END CELLS IN THE DENTAL PULP.

In the illustrations in the present paper I have chiefly chosen parts of the sections
where the dentine is slightly separated from the pulp, since these show the relations
of the nerve fibres to the dentine more clearly, In these parts owing to the very
extensile nature of the nerve fibres, the latter are more or less drawn out into straight
lines and slightly pulled out of the dentinal tubules. In Plate 49, fig. 2, at the very
thin margin of a section, a nerve fibre is shown under great tension, in fact, after I
had photographed this fibre, it gave way and its portions became widely separated.
This great extensibility of the neurofibrils is shown in many preparations; in some
they are drawn out in parallel strings of such tenuity that they can only be properly —
seen with a high power of the microscope, although their continuity is completely
maintained,

The nerve-end cells, which as previously stated, are arranged in groups, form a
definite layer in the pulp, parallel with the inner border of the dentine, and lie
among the odontoblast cells at their proximal ends. They are often seen to com-
municate by parallel cross branches giving a kind of basket-like appearance to the
cluster (fig. 3, Plate 49, and fig. 5, Plate 50).
