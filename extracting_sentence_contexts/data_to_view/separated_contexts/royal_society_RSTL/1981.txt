The communication of the ſmall pox to the child in}

the worab may be ſuppoſed to happen in two Ways; one!
by infection from the mother, as is ſuppoſed in the above"
caſe; the other by themother's having abſorbed the ſmall
pox matter from ſome other perſon, and the matter be-1
ing carried to the child from the conneRton between the
two, which we may ſuppoſe done with or without firſt;
affeting the mother. Teſtimonies and opinions are various with reſpect to
theſe two facts. BOERHAAVE ſeems to have been led b
his experience to think that ſuch infection was not com
municable: for we find that he attended a lady, who
having, in the fixth month of her pregnancy, had the
confluent ſmall pox, brought forth at the regular period
a child, who ſhewed not the leaſt veſtige of his mother
diſeaſe. His commentator, however, VAN SWIETEN, ſupports 3
different opinion (ſee his Comment, vol. V.).
