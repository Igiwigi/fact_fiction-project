again 40 gives 1°26, and ‘22 for the second, 3 giving ‘32. The separations are so small
that no certain conclusions can be drawn as to their origin. The actually observed
numbers may be due to 43 and 4, but 3d and 20 are just possible [but see Note 4].

For Sr the first doublet is useless, as the line is due to the early measurements of
LEHMANN, which are affected with considerable errors. The observed separation for
F,, and F,, gives 101°73 instead of something less than 100°34. The second triplet
gives 2°92 for the separation of the second satellite from the first and 2°06 for the
separation of the satellite of the second line of the triplet, and from analogy with
other satellite series, this would be the separation of the first and second satellites of
the first line. Differences of 33 and 26 give separations of 3°06 and 2°04, so that it
may be concluded that the satellites depend on these differences, a conclusion
supported by the fact that a similar result is indicated as possible for Ca.

Returning to the curious fact noticed above that the first triplets of the series
seem to be dislocated, the second fragment in Sr is found at a distance 143°68 below
its normal position. For the present we note this can be explained by one of two
possible collateral displacements, viz. (—18}) F (2) or F (2) (34,), where F stands for
the normal F, or F;. The case of Ba below will give evidence in favour of the latter
explanation.

In addition to the lines of the series itself, there are two sets of triplets and a
doublet which are clearly analogous in the two elements. They are given in the list
above, following the series lines. The first triplets in each are curious as having the
middle line the strongest.* They are also related to others in the way indicated in
