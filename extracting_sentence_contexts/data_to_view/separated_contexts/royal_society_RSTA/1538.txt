In fact, the underlying strategy of PSR consists in changing the intrinsic
characteristic of a nonlinear system to induce a cooperative effect between the input excitation
and the noisy nonlinear system. In image processing, these techniques have revealed better results
than a classical low-pass filter to denoise black and white images [31]. In fact, the measure of
performance used in this study was the bit error ratio between the original noiseless image and


the processed image. A weaker error was observed for the PSR method which held more the
image details at large noise intensity than when a simple low-pass filter was used. Very recently, another way to take benefit of SR in image processing by adjusting the
system parameters has been addressed in a nonlinear optical system containing photorefractive
or nematic liquid crystals [32-35].
