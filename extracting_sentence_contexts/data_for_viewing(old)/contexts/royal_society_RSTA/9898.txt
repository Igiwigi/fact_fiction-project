Ad SIR WILLIAM CROOKES ON SCANDIUM.

Added April 30th, 1908.

Scandium is remarkable inasmuch as its existence was foretold by MrnpELEEFF,*
and called by him ekaboron, eight years before its actual discovery by Nitson. To-day
I may be permitted to indulge still further in speculations on the genesis and
degradation of the chemical elements—speculations which a few years ago might have
been derided even by a learned Society. But the undoubted fact of the production
of helium from radium, the probability that chemical elements of high atomic weight
are slowly breaking up into bodies of lower atomic weight, and the suspicion that
some well-known chemical elements of low atomic weight are degradation products,
embolden me to speculate on the past history and genesis of scandium.

In 1898 I brought before the Royal Society a scheme of the arrangement in Space
of the chemical elements in which scandium was seen to fall in place between boron
and yttrium. I hesitated to introduce ytterbium into the scheme, as its atomic
weight was not known with sufficient accuracy to enable it to be properly placed.
To-day it is seen to fill a gap below yttrium, and the group is :—Boron, scandium,
yttrium, ytterbium. These four elements have a close relationship, thus :—
