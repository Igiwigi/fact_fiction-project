Most authors have rightly assumed that these facts are not to be under-
stood except on the assumption that the oviduct of the hen can reverse its action and
can pass bodies upward as well as downward through its extent (PARKER, 1906 ; CURTIS,
1916). Itis, therefore, possible that at the time of copulation the relatively voluminous
spermatic discharge may be carried by reversed muscular action up the oviduct of the
hen to the not very distant isthmus; from this point onward the pro-ovarian ciliary
tract would accomplish the remainder of the transportation. In favour of this initial
muscular transfer I have, however, no direct observations beyond the fact that at the
conclusion of the ordinary pairing of the cock and the hen the cloaca of the latter can
be seen to undergo an excessive outward and inward movement suggestive of vigorous
muscular activity of the attached inner parts. Possibly such reversed oviducal move-
ments excited by copulation play an important part, if appropriately timed, in the
formation of double eggs ; for such eggs after having gone down the duct temporarily,
must move up again before they pass finally down the duct to be laid. From the foregoing discussion the following general conclusions, based chiefly on the
oviducal conditions in birds, but believed to apply equally well to the oviducts in reptiles,
may be drawn.
