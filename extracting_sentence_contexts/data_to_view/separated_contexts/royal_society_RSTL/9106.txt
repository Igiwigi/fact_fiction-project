R. Gray in 1844, no less than seven specimens are
mentioned, and I now give a complete list of the birds at present in the national
collection. I would call attention to the fact that the bird from the Orozettes
seems to have darker legs than the Kerguelen hird : whether this occurs only in the
dried skin, or is to be found in the living Sheathbill, must be left for future visitors
to these islands to determine.
