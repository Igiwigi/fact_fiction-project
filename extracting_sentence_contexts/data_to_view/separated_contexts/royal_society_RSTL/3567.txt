Besides confirming the statements of Savr and Waca regarding the apodal
condition of the embryo at the bursting of its shell, and its hexapodal state at a later
period, I have noticed the important additional facts of the detection of the amnion
and chorion [?] which inclosed the embryo, and also the insertion of the funis at the
posterior margin of the penultimate segment of the body, instead of at the dorsal part
of the thoracic region, as seen by Raruke in Crustacea; thus more closely identifying
the structures of the embryo, as well as those of the ovum in Myriapoda, with similar
structures in the ovum, and its development. in the higher classes, and further illus-
trating the persistence of one general law or principle in the development of ani-
mated beings. But not less interesting is the fact, that the growth of the animal takes place by the
addition of entirely new segments, developed in the germinal membrane that con-
nects the penultimate with the then ante-penultimate segment. This mode of increase
by the generation of new segments, and not by the extension or division of those
already ſormed, closely connects the Myriapoda with the Annelides, and somewhat
resembles the growth of segments in the fissiparous Nazades of the latter class, as re-
marked to me by my friend Dr. BaLy, when examining the specimen beneath the
microscope. But it differs from the reproduction in these animals, in the cireumstance
that the segments produced are not the terminal segments of the body, but are new
formations in the germinal membrane interposed between the newly formed ante- and
the permanent penultimate segment.
