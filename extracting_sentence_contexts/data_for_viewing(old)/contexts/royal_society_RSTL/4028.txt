the mercury in the gauge would return back to its first or starting-place.

For the application of cold to these tubes a bath of TaiLomer's mixture of solid
carbonic acid and ether was used. An earthenware dish of the capacity of four cubic
inches or more was fitted into a similar dish somewhat larger, with three or four folds
of dry flannel intervening, and then the bath mixture was made in the inner dish.
Such a bath will easily continue for twenty or thirty minutes, retaining solid carbonic
acid the whole time ; and the glass tubes used would sustain sndden immersion in it
without breaking.

But as my hopes of any success beyond that heretofore obtained depended more
upon depression of temperature than on the pressure which I could employ in these
tubes, I endeavoured to obtain a still greater degree of cold. There are, in fact,
Some results producible by cold which no pressure may be able to effect. 'Phus,
