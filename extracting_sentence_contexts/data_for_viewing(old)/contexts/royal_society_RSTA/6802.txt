may be stationary for all permissible variations du, dv, dw, when ey, ey; xy have the
expressions (3) in terms of our ‘non-dimensional’ u, v and w. This last assertion is
easily verified,* (11) being derived from (65) by variation of u and », (61) by variation
of w. On the right of (65), the first term relates to the strain energy of flexure, the
second to the strain energy of extension, and the third to the potential of the (uniform)

applied pressure.

31. Plainly, in Example 3 the equilibrium is stable, so the stationary value of ¥ is
in fact a minimum; and the argument from energy (leading to a treatment entailing
surface integrals) will occasionally be of value, used in conjunction with the normal
technique of liquidation effected on a ‘relaxation net’. For example, having distributions
of u,v, w which constitute an approximation to the correct type of deflexion, we may want
to decide their optimal magnitudes. These may be deduced from (65) as follows.

Multiplying the given values of w by k, according to (3) we shall leave the distributions
Of é.45 yy» €y Unaltered if at the same time we multiply u and v by k?. Thereby we shall
multiply the first integral on the right of (65) by k?, the second by f*, and the third by k:
consequently ¥ so far as it depends on k will be given by an expression of the form
