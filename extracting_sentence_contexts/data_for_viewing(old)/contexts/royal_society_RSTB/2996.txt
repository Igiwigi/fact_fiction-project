48 DR. A. J. EWART ON THE ASCENT OF WATER IN TREES.

cylinder = 0°4 centim. ; average number of vessels = 5500; average internal diameter
= 0°0048 centim. (largest = 0°007).

Observations.—Maximal rate of flow = 90 centims. per hour; maximal amount of
flow = 14 cub. centims. per hour.

At a rate of 90 centims. per hour, 5500 vessels of 0:0000181 sq. centim. internal
cross-section would discharge per hour 8°96 cub. centims.

As will be shown subsequently, this discrepancy is due to the fact that in elder
stems water passes through the pith when driven through under pressure.

By Potsrurur’s formula, from 5500 vessels of length 45 centims. and diameter
0-0088 centim. under a pressure of 250 centims. of water at 18° C., 147 cub. centims.
per hour of water would pass through, which is about 10 times the amount actually
escaping.

Apple.—Temp. 20° C.

Data,—Head of water = 3 metres; length of stem = 25 centims.; diameter
=1°5 centims. (eight years old); wood = 1°35 centims.; pith = 0°12 centim. ;
diameter (internal) of largest vessels in cross-section=0°005 centim. ; number= 28,000.
