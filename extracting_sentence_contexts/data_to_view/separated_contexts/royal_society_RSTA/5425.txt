Of these 7 will be a function, but they are not of the nature of ordinary dynamical
coordinates. Their value merely determines the instantaneous form of J as a function of
ordinary coordinates, so that if one or more of the hysteresis-coordinates change, the
form of J changes and a new dynamical era begins. In fact, they are very analogous
to 0, and like @ they must not be varied when the dynamical coordinates are varied
in order to obtain the equations of motion. A mathematical development of Professor
Ew1ne’s theory may be supposed to furnish the nature of these variables, and experi-
ment must then be appealed to at once to test the theory, and if the test be favour-
able, to find the exact form of / in terms of the variables. And from the mathematical
development, or that combined with experiment, we must look to find the laws of
variation of the hysteresis coordinates when H and ¥ vary.
