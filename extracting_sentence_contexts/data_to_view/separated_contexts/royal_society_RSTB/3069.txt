{ It is probable that anemophily is not so general in
the group as is commonly supposed. The fact that the mature male cones of species
of Encephalartos and Cycas possess a very offensive and penetrating odour is in
confirmation of Hooxer’s suggestion§ that entomophily occurs among the Cycads. This question, and many others of great interest in connection with the biology
of the gymnosperms, can only be settled by the study of living plants in their natural
habitats. Hooker records that ‘the cones are often bored through and through after the
manner of flower-buds attacked by the larve of Curculionide.”||
