The evolutionary behaviour of the particle-volume distribution function shown in figure 7
is also different for ellipsoidal and spherical aggregates. First, the distribution function for all
crystals increases with increasing the dimensionless volume s and is limited by the maximum
aggregate size s,, =a. Note that the same moment of time t = 13 for ellipsoidal and spherical
crystals occurs at different values of the parameter w. Second, with increasing time, the
distribution function decreases due to crystal growth and a slowdown in the nucleation of new
particles at lower supercooling values. Third, the distribution function of ellipsoidal aggregates
is significantly lower than that of spherical ones at the same time. In addition, it is shifted
toward larger values of crystal volumes. This is again explained by the fact that ellipsoidal
particles of the same volume with spherical particles have a larger surface area. Therefore, a
larger heat of crystallization is released from such a surface, and, as a result, ellipsoidal particles
grow faster and more quickly compensate for the supercooling. Under conditions of lesser
supercooling, the nucleation of new ellipsoidal particles is inhibited, which leads to a decrease in
the distribution function (as compared to spherical particles) and its shift towards larger values
of the dimensionless volume s.

4. Dynamics of a polydisperse ensemble of ellipsoidal and spherical particles
with fluctuations in crystal growth rates

In this section, we consider the evolution of a polydisperse ensemble of crystals, taking into
account fluctuations in their growth rates [14,52,53]. Keeping this in mind, the kinetic equation
