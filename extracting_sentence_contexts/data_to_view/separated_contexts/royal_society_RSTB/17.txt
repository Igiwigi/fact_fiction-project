MINUTE ANALYSIS OF CORTICAL CENTRES. 161

We would first draw attention (see fig. 5) to the fact that the movement of simple
extension is alone represented in the posterior extremity of the middle frontal
convolution (according to our view), viz., at centres 12, 13, 12’, and 13’ (see Table 3
and fig. 5). It will be observed on Table 3 that in three instances we noted
interosseal flexion in this region. Discussion of the relation between interosseal
flexion and extension of the digits we shall enter into further on,

As regards the movement of flexion, we find that it is represented over the whole
of the area which has been the subject of our investigations, with the exception of
the centres above mentioned, viz., 12, 13, 12’, and 13’.
