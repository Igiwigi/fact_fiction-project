Mathematics
poses two distinct problems for theories of explanation [13, p. 134]. Firstly, the existence of


mathematical explanations in the natural sciences is difficult to reconcile with some theories of 3 |
scientific explanation: not all such theories leave room for a physical observation to be explained

by appeal to a mathematical fact. Secondly, explanation within mathematical practice is a hard
case for many theories of explanation: the facts of mathematics do not appear to be related
by either laws of nature or causation. Our concern is exclusively with the second problem,
intramathematical explanation, although some of the theories devised to address it may also seek
to address the first problem, extramathematical explanation. One response to the difficulty of characterizing mathematical explanation would be to deny
that there is any such thing.
