of caudal elements. At a water temperature of 18-19° C., hatching of the tadpole of
Molgula oculata occurred from 10 to 12 hours from fertilisation, the onset of phago-
cytosis of the tail and first appearance of ampulle occurred after 18 hours from fertilisa-
tion and was completed in most at 24 hours. In the development of Molgula occulta
under the same conditions, hatching occurred after about 12 hours from fertilisation,
i.e. slightly though definitely later than the tadpole of M. oculata. The ampulle

became recognisable as such from 14-15 hours from fertilisation, while the highly
refractive “ caudal” cell mass became visible after 20 hours. The later appearance of
these phagocytised cells may be due to the fact that in anural embryos they do not
become by any means so highly refractive as the corresponding cells in urodele embryos,
probably as the result of the non-vacuolisation of the chordal cells. Therefore, in com-
paring the development of these two species it is seen that there is but very little
difference between the time of attainment of the various stages of development in the
two forms. Hatching occurs a little later in the anural form, but as this is effected by
the swelling of the larval test, and as the swelling also marks the onset of degeneration
of the “ caudal” elements and appearance of ampullee, these last two phenomena are
somewhat earlier than in the urodele form. But they are at least as late in develop-
ment as the fully formed and hatched tadpole of Molgula oculata. That is, there is no
question of precocity of development of caudal degeneration or test secretion in the
anural form, other than that accounted for by the absence of a larval free-swimming
period and as, according to Damas, precocity of neural tube formation is to be correlated
