The anterior part of the normal lower tube is extensively degen-
erated but quite recognisable. The middle part is well seen in such a section as that shown in fig. 50,
Plate 26, and it continues to be strongly marked till it vanishes posteriorly. The upper induced set of folds,
which are well developed anteriorly, become posteriorly very thin and flat and the meagreness of their
appearance is increased by the fact that they are obliquely cut, fig. 51, Plate 26. This specimen, then, shows parts of four sets of neural folds, namely, the normal upper folds which
appear first and induce a somewhat spasmodic appearance of an induced set of folds in the lower ectoderm
and the normal lower folds which have induced a fourth set in the upper ectoderm. At about the same level as the induced upper embryo, a sac of mesoderm appears on the left; no beating
structure was observed in the living specimen on this side, but this mesodermal sac is very probably the
left heart rudiment.
