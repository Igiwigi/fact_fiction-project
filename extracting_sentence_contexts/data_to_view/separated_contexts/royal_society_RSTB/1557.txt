A special portion of the superficial coat of the bladder hitherto referred to by us as the
transverse membrane.* In P, tigrinum, and presumably in P. fusciatwn also, there
is no transverse membrane distinct from the apparent proper anterior wall, and there-
fore, so far us these species are concerned, it is possible that the skeletally-attached
onter stratum of the latter may be the equivalent of Sorunsen’s “ la plovre” and our
transyerse membrane. But in Avins a skeletally-nttached outer stratum of the
antertor wall and a transyerse membrane coexist, and consequently the one can
scateely be an equivulent to the other in cases where either is absent, Hence to us
it seams more reasonable to assume that the skeletally-attached stratum of the

anterior wall has much the same yale both in Arius and Platystome, aud in cach
nike is wholly or partially n portion of the tunica externa; and further, that the
transyerse membrane as a separable and distinct structure is entirely wanting in
Platystoma—w fact which may possibly be associated with the extensive insertion of
the great compressor museles’ into the walls of the bladder. We lave elsewhere, in
our description of Mecrores, given reasons for beheving that even the tmneverse
membraue is mevely a special portion of the superficial coat of the air-bladder, whieh,
for physiological purposes, has acquired certain fixed skeletal attachments, and with a
similar olject itis readily conceiyable that, in addition, even w stratum of fibres
belonging to the tunica externa of the anterior wall my <lso acquire a similar von-
nection with rigid portions of the axial skeleton, such, in fact, as we have shown to
be the case in Arius and in Platystoma, and other normal Pimelodine,

On the whole the Weberian ossicles in Arius pidaide ave very similar to those of
Platystoma, The anterior process of the tripis (fig. 49, ta.) is somewhat.
