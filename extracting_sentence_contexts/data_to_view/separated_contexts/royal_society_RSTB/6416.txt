In a number of these
insects the gonad rudiments extend over almost the entire length of the abdomen,
and subsequently a secondary contraction of this extent occurs. Also the coelomic
ampullae are more or less segmentally arranged in the abdomen and one pair of
them usually forms the termination of the mesodermal section of the genital ducts. These facts give support to the view, as pointed out by Semet (1924) and WirsMANN
(1926), that in the ancestors of insects the gonads stretched throughout the length
of the abdomen and that they opened to the outside by means of segmentally-
arranged ducts. The development and homologies of the insect genitalia is a very vexed question. The various views regarding it have been dealt with by Net (1929), and summarized
and critically discussed by Imms (1931).
