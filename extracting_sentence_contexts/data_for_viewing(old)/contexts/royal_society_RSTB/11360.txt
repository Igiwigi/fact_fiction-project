Another interpretation of Turing’s mathematical analysis pattern-forming mechanisms by various protein interaction

of two-component systems, which appears to take these con- systems—i.e. the Min system in Escherichia coli, the Cdc42

siderations into account, is the ‘activator—depletion’ model system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the PAR system in

[4,6] (figure 1c). It differs from the activator—inhibitor Caenorhabditis elegans. Based on these systems we will then
