Here,
we discuss only the scattering suppression at different angles based on interferences between ED
and MD, which can certainly be extended to higher order multipoles.

5. Electric and toroidal multipoles

Though dynamic toroidal multipoles play an essential role in the expansions for arbitrary
charge-current distributions [15,17], they had not attracted much attention until the recent
demonstration of TDs in engineered metamaterials [19]. This is largely due to the fact that in
the far field toroidal multipoles are identical to their electric multipolar counterparts [17]. At
the same time, conventional multipole expansions are usually conducted for charge-current
distributions that are far smaller than the effective wavelength, where the contributions of toroidal
multipoles are negligible [15,18]. Though the isolated excitation of dynamic toroidal multipoles
would require careful structure engineering to match the special corresponding near-field current
distributions [17,19], it is also shown recently that even simple homogeneous dielectric particles
can support TDs [18,6163], though they are co-excited with the electric and magnetic multipoles.
