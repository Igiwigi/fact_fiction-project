In every one of the numerous experiments made with the nitrite of amy], the
chemical energy appeared to exhaust itself in the frontal portion of the experimental
tube. A dense white cloud would fall for a distance of 12 or 15 inches upon the beam,
while beyond this distance the tube would appear almost empty. 'This absence of action
might naturally be ascribed to the diffusion of the beam beyond the focus; but when
the light was s0 converged as to bring the focus near the distant end of the tube the effect
was the same. When, moreover, a concaye mirror received a parallel beam which had
traversed the tube, and returned it into the vapour in a high state of luminous concen-
tration, the light was ineffectual. The passage of the beam through a comparatively
small depth of the vapour appeared to extract from it those constituents which produced
decomposition. That the vapour was present at the distant end of the tube, was proved
by the fact that both with the sun and with the electric light the reversal of the tube
instantly brought down a heavy cloud. As regards the chemical rays nitrite of amyl is
the Vackest substance that I have yet encountered. It rapidly extinguishes them,
leaving behind a beam of sensibly undiminished photometric intensity, but powerless as
a chemical agent as far as the nitrite is concerned.

In these experiments air was employed as the vehicle of the nitrite-of-amyl yapour.
By varying the quantity sent into the experimental tube, it was possible to vary in a
remarkable manner the character of the resulting decompoxsition. The most splendid
diffraction colours could be thus produced, and the finest texture could be imparted to the
clouds. When pure oxygen or pure nitrogen was used, the effect was almost the same
