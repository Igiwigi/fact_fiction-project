It has been shown in a previous section (130) that it appears to be possible to
stimulate the retina with a point of light so small that almost all of it falls on one foveal
cone. When this is done there is no indication that there is any spreading of the image,
either due to optical phenomena or to neurological interconnexions. If in fact spreading

takes place, its effect must be entirely eliminated by the visual centres of the brain. VISUAL PERCEPTION OF FINE DETAIL 635

(140) Micro-stimulator design

During the experiments with the first micro-stimulator, described in earlier sections of
this Part, it became evident that two modifications would be desirable: (1) to increase the
diameter of the plotting-board, so that a larger area of retina could be stimulated, this
being done in such a way that the definition is not sacrificed; and (2) to provide means so
that, when necessary, more than one monochromatic beam of light could be used for
stimulating the retina, both of these being movable in the visual field, or one being movable
and the other remaining stationary. It has been found that several types of stimulator are possible:

Type 1.
