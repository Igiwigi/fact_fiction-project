The time scale of the
brightening can be anything from seconds to years, and the observed light curve
gives information on the lens mass, the relative distances and the motion of the
lensing object (assuming the background object is stationary). As microlensing
is a transient phenomenon, an effective survey strategy is to monitor a dense
star field repeatedly, searching for that rare occasion when an individual star
increases its brightness. Of course, complicating such searches is the fact that
many stars are genuinely variable in their output. Once a likely event has been
triggered, it can be monitored more intensively to see if the light curve is of the
form expected for microlensing. For a survey monitoring the dense star field in
the centre of the Milky Way, the optical depth is about 2 x 10~Â® (or an event at
a particular time for every 400000 stars being studied).
