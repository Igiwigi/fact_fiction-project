series of 4 subsystems that can exchange mass (and therefore energy). They might represent small
portions of the AMR box, with fixed volume V, and temperature T (as long as they are thermally
connected). They can exchange mass, so, at equilibrium, one should also expect that they have
the same chemical potential. The total AMR system is however closed with fixed mass V = )>, Ny,
and volume V = }>, V,. The total energy balance in AMR is, quite generally,

AU =AQ- AW, (2.1)

where the term AW is the work done by the system and it is divided into two parts, AW=
AW + AW,. The first term AW is the work done by the system under some change in its
global constraints and —AW is the work we need to perform to (reversibly) add a new internal
constraint into the system (see reference [23]). Note that — AW, is also the work done by the system
along the inverse path [23] but only if the new internal constraint is released reversibly. In fact, in an
irreversible process related to the removal of the internal constraint, the system’s work —Awit
can even be zero and, in this case, the work we have done to impose the internal constraint —-AW,
is completely converted into heat upon the constraint removal (like a free expansion without a
piston).

The heat exchanged with the surroundings is AQ, and the second law states that it will
be smaller than the increase in entropy produced when some internal constraint is removed
(spontaneous or induced process),

TAS > AQ. (2.2)

In terms of work, this relation implies that the system does maximum work when the internal
