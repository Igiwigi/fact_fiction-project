3. The periodic table

Iam a biologist writing for an audience that I assume will consist primarily of chemists and
physicists so I suspect I have limited insight to offer about the periodic table. Since my goal is

to write about what the table and tree have in common and since I assume the tree is less well : =
known to this audience, I will spend more words on the tree than the table. The extra detail on : =
the tree is needed to establish the common ground between the two in terms of why they were so :3
successful and so enduring. : =

Virtually all science classrooms and many lecture halls display the periodic table at the front :R
of the room, over the top of the blackboard, sometimes to be referred to in lectures, but always : 3
as an icon of truth. The factual nature of the rows and columns of this table or the information 18
it incorporates about the elements are widely accepted. Scerri argues that ‘the periodic table of :8
chemistry is neither a theory nor a model but more akin to an ‘organizing principle’, for want :8
of a better term’ [1]. While the table does not represent a theory, it has been the foundation for ‘S

the development of theory and embodies the properties attributed to the dictionary definition
of theory, so there is sufficient basis for comparing what the periodic table and the theory of
evolution have in common.

While there are many parallels between the two, one key difference is that chemistry was
a large, well-established discipline before the discovery of the periodic table and evolutionary
biology was not. The periodic table is a significant signpost on the road to our understanding
the structure of matter. The Origin of Species had some precedents but it was not embedded in a
