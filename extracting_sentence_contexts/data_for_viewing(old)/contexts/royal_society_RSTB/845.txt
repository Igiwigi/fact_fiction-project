Method of Excitation.—The excitation, as before, was applied by fine platinum
electrodes 2 millims. apart and furnished from the secondary coil of a Du Bots-
Reymonp inductorium served by a one-litre bichromate cell. The strength of the
faradic current used was very weak, the distance of the secondary coil varying from
12 to a maximum of 9 centims. Momentary application of the electrodes was also
resorted to for the detection of the initial contraction. For the complete development
of any movement, and at the same time ensuring against the incidence of epilepsy, we
found that usually 2 seconds was a sufficient duration for the stimulus.

Arrangement of the Results Obtained.—Even with every effort to obtain an animal
of the same size and age and of the same variety, it is nevertheless impossible to avoid
certain minute differences which render difficult the direct transference of the facts
relating to one square in one animal to another square in another experiment.

We combined the results of our twenty experiments in the following manner, and
from control observations subsequently carried out are sure that our procedure has
not involved any serious error.

Mode of Notation.—As in each experiment we had made exact drawings of the
sulci on the ruled paper (see fig. 2), it was easy to denominate the horizontal lines of
squares in successive order from the fissure of SyLvrus by capital letters, viz. —
A, B, C, D, E, &e. (see fig. 2), whereas the vertical rows were designated by italic
letters a, b, c, d, e, &c., commencing opposite the praecentral sulcus and proceeding
from front to back.
