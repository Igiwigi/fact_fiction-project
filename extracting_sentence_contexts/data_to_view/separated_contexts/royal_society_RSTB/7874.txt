The
fimbrial folds and grooves extend from the ‘funnel’ into the tube itself and continue for
a considerable part of its length. The lumen grows progressively narrower, and the sur-
rounding muscle layer becomes stronger. Apart from the fact that the Fallopian tube in
the elephant is not suspended by a mesosalpinx but lies beneath the peritoneum, as already
described, it resembles that of such animals as the pig, a strongly fimbriated and ciliated
segment gradually giving way, as one proceeds towards the uterine horn, to a strongly
muscular and non-ciliated segment. The uterus may conveniently be divided into three regions, that of distinct right and
left uterine horns, that in which the cornua fuse but the lumina remain distinct, and that
with a single uterine lumen. The first two are histologically distinguished from the third
by the fact that the uterine wall is glandular in the first two segments, while in the third it
is not.
