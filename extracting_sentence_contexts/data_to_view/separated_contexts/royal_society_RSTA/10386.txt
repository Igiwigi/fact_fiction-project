When carbon disulphide is mixed with oxygen the preliminary period of uniform
movement is shorter and is immediately sueceeded by the detonation-wave. These
two mixtures appear to be typical of other gaseous mixtures, carbon disulphide with
oxygen resembling oxygen mixtures generally, carbon disulphide with nitric oxide
resembling air mixtures generally. Matrarp and Le Craverier draw attention to the fact that in the explosions
starting at the open end of the tube the development of the detonation-wave is not
progressive, but always instantaneous. The detonation-wave is characterised not
only by its great velocity of movement, but by its intense luminosity and the very
high pressures instantaneously set up in it.

i

. On the other hand, Mantarp and Lx Cuarenier found that, when the mixture of
carbon disulphide and nitrie oxide was fired near the closed end of the tube the
: movement of the flame was uniformly accelerated, until the detonation-wave was set
: up.
