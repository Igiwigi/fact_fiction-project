238 DR. C. E. BEEVOR AND PROFESSOR V. HORSLEY ON THE

Character of Movement in the March.

There are several differences in the character of the successive movements repre-
sented in the ascending parietal convolution and those in the ascending frontal
convolution. Thus, the shoulder in the parietal gyrus, instead of exhibiting the
representation of “advancing,” as in the frontal gyrus, is almost invariably adducted
and retracted (rarely elevated) at the centres 11 and 79,

PART VII—MISCELLANEOUS FACTS.

There are several facts of general interest which have conie to light in the course
of our experiments,

lines separating continuous areas of representation.
The centres which come into this category are :—

31, 36, 37, 38, 89, 50, 51, 6, 6’, 80.
