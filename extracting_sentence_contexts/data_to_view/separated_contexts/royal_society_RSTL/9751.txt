with the nitrate of soda. Of individual mineral constituents, not
supplied in either manure, more lime, more magnesia, and considerably more of potass,
phosphoric acid, and silica, were removed in the produce by the nitrate than in that by
the ammonia-salts. To attempt to explain these results, even as fully as the data at command will
allow, would be to go beyond the facts more special to this section, and to trench upon
those specially belonging to the botanical and chemical sections, and would, indeed,
involve a long discussion. It must suffice in this place briefly to indicate the main
points. Under the influence of the nitrate of soda a greater total number of species
maintained a place than under that of the ammonia-salts.
