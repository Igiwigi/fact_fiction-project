An example of a trace explanation, describing object-level reasoning, is: : 3

‘The remaining question is: can 20102010” be written as 4 x (x — 2k)? Clearly, by solving for k, we get k = x/2 —
(20102010 )/8, which are integers, so the answer is affirmative.

This is actually not needed, since we can simple swap Bs <> Bg enough times to adjust the content of By.

An example of a strategic explanation, explaining problem-solving strategy, is:

Come to think of it, it should be clear that 112 cannot be quite right, because it always chooses a; as the final step. But we have
examples where that isn’t right (a; was arbitrary so that Lig aj was not in M1), so we know that the correct solution will have to
account for the fact that there may be multiple a; which satisfy that condition, some of which may not be part of a solving path.

An example of a deep explanation, explaining a particular misunderstanding, is:

Hi! don’t understand Tao's proof. More specifically, | don’t get the last sentence ‘But this forces / to contain 11 distinct elements, a
contradiction:

Can anyone elaborate the point a little further for me, please?

We looked at proof #1 and have an additional suggestion to pietropc’s suggestions in his post: in the last paragraph, one should chose
i as the greatest element rather than smallest (or change a; + An—jp1 + +++ + An—1 tO; + My_jp2 + +++ +ay) to
