Both plates have been
faceted at a low angle to the upper face around the perimeter in an irregular fashion. From a gemological perspective, the stones appear flawless when examined with a loupe and
appear colourless and transparent when viewed through the stone. The colour evident around
the faceted edges suggests that they are in fact pale yellow. A decision not to perform a study of the cathodoluminescence of the diamond was made
because the possibility of damage could not be eliminated. However, viewing the diamonds
in intense ultraviolet light reveals a spectacular growth history as shown in figure 2 which
is unparalleled in terms of size and form.
