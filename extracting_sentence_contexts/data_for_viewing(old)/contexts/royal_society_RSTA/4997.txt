that eventually (for d sufficiently large) enters when k = 3, as predicted in the number field setting
by Diaconu and colleagues [10,21]?

If we fix d and allow k to grow, it appears that yz is not as impressive. For example, we show in
§5, for d=3 and any k > 10, that p = i (we restrict in that section to q prime). In §6 we prove, for
d=4and any k>9, that p= $ (again with q restricted to being prime).

We took advantage, in tabulating zeta functions, and also in deriving the formulae described
below in §§5 and 6, of the fact that the same zeta functions in Hg arise repeatedly.
For D(x) € Hya, let us denote its coefficients as cy = cy(D):
