The first term in the integral of equation (4.3) represents the probability of obtaining the
natural period T given the period T, the elastic modulus E and the effective height h (i.e. the
measurement uncertainties), while the second one represents the probability of obtaining T given
the elastic modulus E and the effective height h (i.e. the modelling uncertainties). To represent
these uncertainties, two zero-mean Gaussian distributions were selected. These distributions are
centred on the experimental measurement and the model output, respectively.

By using the experimental measurement of the first natural period, the updated results are
illustrated in figures 7 and 8. A reduction is observed in the range of variability of the two
random variables (figure 8), together with a significant modification of the shape of the posterior
distribution. This change highlights the exclusion of several combinations of the elastic modulus
and the effective height. This aspect is particularly evident in figure 7. Indeed, despite the
fact that the elastic modulus and the effective height can be considered as independent, these
two parameters jointly contributed to the definition of the natural period of the tower. This
consideration explains the shape of the posterior joint-PDF, highlighted in figure 7.
