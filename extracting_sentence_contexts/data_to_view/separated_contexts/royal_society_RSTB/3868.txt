Tn compiling these tables, one brood was omitted owing to the extreme pathological
smallness of the new-born young. It must also be recorded that in one generation
one line of each of two clones was kept for a few days under slightly different
conditions from those described in the text as the general conditions. This fact is,
however, only recorded for the purely formal reason that it constituted an exception
to these conditions.* It certainly had no significant influence on the correlation
coefficient. As stated in the text, four generations were combined to construct these tables. Hence a number of individuals appear in them twice, both as offspring of their
ancestors and ancestors of their own offspring.
