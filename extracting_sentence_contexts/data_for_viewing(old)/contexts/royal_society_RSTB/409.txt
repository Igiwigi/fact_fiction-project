of each individual segment is integrated in the cortex of the Orang. Too much stress
cannot be laid upon this point since it demonstrates incontestably the great advance
in evolution of function of the Orang’s cortex above that of the Macacque, for, in the
latter animal, single primary* movements were only rarely obtained, and even then
by only momentary application of the electrodes,

Tn complete harmony with this view we also see that at only two groups of squares
was there a combination of segmental movements in the upper limb (viz., 83, and 28,
29, 30), and these only involved the digits and wrist, whereas in the lower limb no
less than nine such combinations were observed, and those (owing to duplication) at
eleven squares.

The limited extent of such combinations is also manifested by the fact that all the
segments of the lower limb were thrown into action at only two squares (63 and 64),
and at a large number of the remainder only two segments were involved.

We have now to consider four points in this connection, these are :—

(1.) Combination of facial and oro-lingual movements.

(2.) Juxtaposition of synergic segments.

(3.) Character of movements in each march.

(4.) Relative position of squares from which marches were obtained.
