As shown in [69], system (2.8) admits globally defined smooth classical
solutions in the subcritical (a € (1/2, 1]) and in the critical (w = 1/2) regime. On the other hand,
finite-time blow-up occurs in the supercritical regime (a € [0,1/2)). The fractional Burgers system
is thus a useful simple model to study singular behaviour, especially given the fact that the three-
dimensional Navier-Stokes system is also known to be globally well posed in the classical sense in
the presence of fractional dissipation with exponents a > 5/4 [70]. The fractional Burgers system
(2.8) has also been studied in connection with turbulence [71]. Generalizations of the instantaneous estimate (2.3) for the case of the fractional Burgers system
(2.8) have been obtained in [12].
