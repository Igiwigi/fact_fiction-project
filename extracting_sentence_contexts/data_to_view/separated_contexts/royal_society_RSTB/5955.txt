American continent. The Catarrhines, more progressive, branched off on a
line of their own and, as the result of acceleration and abbreviation of their develop-
mental processes, so perfected their placental arrangements that one or other of their
early branches proved capable of giving origin to the final grade in Primate evolution,
the Anthropoid, as I have designated it, comprising the Anthropoid Apes and Man. The following scheme indicates the way in which I would arrange the sub-divisions
of the Primates in a phyletic series, on the basis of the known facts concerning their
development :â€”

It is no part of my task in this lecture to attempt to correlate the developmental
with the morphological and other evidence bearing on the large and complex question
of the phylogeny of the Primates. I am well aware, however, that certain morpho-
logical facts do not, at the moment, appear to fit in with the phylogenetic scheme here
envisaged, cf. for example, the striking observations of my colleague, THoRNTON CARTER
('22) on the structure of the enamel in the Primates which, taken at their face value,
seem to support the conception of the diphyletic origin of the Old and New World
Monkeys rather than the monophyletic view I have been led to adopt. The significance
of these and other like facts must remain over for future determination and discussion,*
but meantime I venture to claim that the views herein put forward on developmental
grounds are by no means lacking in support from the morphological side.
