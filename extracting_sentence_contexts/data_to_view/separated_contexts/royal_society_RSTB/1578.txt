wutdvedent peobability that the Weberian ossicles are directly related to this function,
The general structive of the vir-bladder, the mode of interconuection of the different
Woborian ossicles, aud their relations both to the air-bhudder and to the internal ear,
fe well as the rdlations iter sc of tle different parts of the two last-mentioned
strogtives, are perfectly consistent with this theory, against which no anatomical
objections can be urged, and are equally inconsistent with any other at present
a

The division of the air-bladder into a small, elastic, and expansible anterior portion,
ind a relatively large, inelastic, and inexpansible posterior division, renders that organ
S admirably adapted for the measurement of the varying volumes of the contained guses,
% inasmuch ag the volumetric variations in the relatively lurge volume of gas contained in
= the whole bladder will find their expression almost, exclusively iu corresponling altera-
6, tions in the size of the anterior chamber through the expansion or contraction of its
A |uteral walls, which alone are directly connected with the recording Weberian ossicles.
Â© Negarded, in fact, as an article of physical apparatus. the air-bladdev may be compared
~ with such instruments as, for example, the thermometer, by which the expansion or
8 contraction of merenry or alcohol under the influence of changes of temperature is
= accurilely measured, In both instruments there is a relatively large reseryoir in free
2 ommunication with a much smuller one, and the expansion or contraction of the
B relatively large mass of pas, or fluid, as the case muy be, in the larger chamber ts
= measured by the more veadily observed expansion or contraction of the contents of
8 the smaller chambar; and hence, there is a close fanctional parallelism between the
S anterior and posterior divisions of the air-bladder and the capillary tube and bulb of
2 athermometer respectively. Similarly it may also be said that the anterior chamber
% of the air-bladder is, to some extent, constructed on the principle of an aneroid baure-
= wieler, inasmuch as the susceptibility of the recordimg lever (Weberian ovsicles),
& connected with the former to the varying volumes of the contained gases, is consider-
~ #bly increased by the comparative rigidity of its anterior, posterior, dorsal, and ventral
3 walls and the consequent restriction of any expansion or contraction to movements
F of its Jateral walls alone, in mueh the satoe way that the expansion or contraction of
6 the air contained within the metallic box of the aneroid will find its sole expression in
corresponding movements of the flexible upper wall of the box, which alone is capable
of transmitting such internal volumetric changes to the external recording lever; in
fyot, in a certain sense it may be said that the air-bladder of the Osturiophysee
qombines tlie structural principles of both che thermometer and the aneraid barometer. The varying relative dimensions of the anterior aud posterior chambers of the air-
bladder in different Silurides very probably bear sore relation tu corresponding varia-
tions in the delicacy of the Weberian mechanism as a pressuve register in varions
species, for, as ia the case with the analogous parts of the thermometer, the suacepti-
bility of the mechanism should, within certain limits, increase as the posterior eliataboers
bevome larger and the anterior chamber smaller.
