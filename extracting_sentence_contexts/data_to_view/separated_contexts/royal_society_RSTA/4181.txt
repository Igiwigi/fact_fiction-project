We suggest that EEG oscillations in
the 6 band are the most promising metrics to be used in such an evaluation, especially because this
band have a significant role in monitoring the attentional significance of emotions [92]. However,
it is possible to hypothesize that different EEG bands couple with different aspects of ANS
dynamics. As a matter of fact, in the electronic supplementary material, we were able to show
distinct pattern of coupling between different EEG bands and heartbeat dynamics, although they
were less supported by psychological and neurobiological bases. To this extent, further studies
should effectively focus on other specific bands than 6, also including a larger number of subjects
in order to take into account other covariates such as personality traits and subjective IAPS
rating, which may influence central and peripheral signalling. Moreover, quantification of the
exact amount of nonlinear coupling occurring in brain-heart dynamics should also be performed.
