To curb the negative impacts of vibration and fatigue damage, researchers in recent years have 2 |
introduced the concept of pitch control in wind turbines [2,3] as a means to control aerodynamic

loads. The use of pitch control in general marks a major advancement towards control of â€œ3
vibration, though it brings in associated difficulties related to careful design consideration to : a
avoid interference with torque control [4]. As often unrecognized in the field of wind energy, load :<
control and vibration control are two faces of the same coin. Hence, vibration control strategies : s
could be considered as an alternative effective means to achieve the identical aim of control of : g

structural vibrations and fatigue-related damage in the same way that pitch control would do
by load control. In fact, vibration control strategies would not have the drawback of interference
with torque control or stresses generated by pitching the blades. Although structural vibration
control has been an active area of research for the past two decades, developing structural control
strategies and applying those to wind turbines is a relatively new field of research.

The primary modes of vibration of wind turbine blades are in-plane (primarily edgewise) and : =
out-of-plane (primarily flapwise). These two modes of vibration are coupled, as the blades are : yy
structurally pre-twisted in general. Besides, owing to the coupling of the aerodynamic loads in 2
the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, the responses (in-plane and out-of-plane) of the blades aes
are coupled too. This coupling gives rise to nonlinearity due to aero-elasticity, as the loads are 22
dependent on the response of the flexible blades. Of the two modes, the edgewise mode has very : Ss
low or almost no aerodynamic damping, whereas the flapwise mode is aerodynamically damped DN
in nature. Thus, the edgewise modes are of concern, as they may induce instabilities, while the : =
