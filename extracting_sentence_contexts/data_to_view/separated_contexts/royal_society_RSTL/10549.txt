Hecnrt's method was not very dissimilar to that of Jamix. There is an important
oversight in his paper. In estimating the probable error of D he makes the tacit
assumption that a certain quantity he calls $ is known accurately ; while in fact the
main part of the error results from the inaccuracy of this $. Correcting this I obtain
—using my own notation—for

$=2* 224 D=:1224 (+-0006)
$=7* 11'4 © D=2750 (+009)

whence I deduce for the former P,=12'72+1'8, for the latter P,=15:82 +57. The results obtained in my own earlier paper were vitiated, partly by the addition
of 8ome corrections founded on an erroneous argument, and partly by the bad faces of
the plate examined.
