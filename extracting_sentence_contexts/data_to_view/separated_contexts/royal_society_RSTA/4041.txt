This result seems paradoxical,
because the electrolyte is expected to suppress the electrostatic interparticle repulsion and to
lower the surface pressure /7. A possible explanation for this result is proposed in ยง3d. Figure 2d illustrates three experimental facts, namely (i) the experimental curves possess large
linear portions when plotted as [7 versus A~/?; (ii) the magnitude of the surface pressure /7


increases with increasing KCI concentration; and (iii) for the same KCI concentration (0.1 mM),
IT is systematically lower on expansion than on compression, i.e. a pronounced hysteresis effect
is present. Moreover, the curves in figure 2c,d indicate good reproducibility of the experimental
curves obtained in three consecutive compression/expansion cycles. The theory of the surface
pressure of monolayers from charged particles is presented in the next section and possible
explanations for the observed effects are proposed.
