I have several
records of old mares being covered seven or eight times without offspring. This
custom of breeders was much more rife in the early days of breeding than it appears
to be now, when some breeders discard or sell a fairly old mare, even if she is barren
two or three successive years. Clearly the custom gives the mare a fictitious
fecundity, far below her real value, and probably accounts for granddams having a
somewhat less fecundity than their granddaughters. The next problem to be answered was the effect the method of forming my
fecundity ratios might have on the relative numbers which would be found in
different element-groups. For example, supposing the element of fecundity to be
1/10, or the element-groups 0-1/20, 1/20-3/20, 3/20-5/20, . . . 17/20-19/20, 19/20-1,
would the fact that the fecundity ratio is a ratio of whole numbers cause, @ priori, a
greater probability of frequency in one of these element-groups than another ?
