Other data of a similar kind might be cited in support of the hypothesis that the
permeability is intimately related to the crystalline structure, and of the deduction
therefrom that observation of the permeability variation may be valuable as a means
of tracing continuously variations in the state of crystallisation of the material.

It will be seen that the experiments described in this paper bear directly upon this
point; but before considering the evidence of the validity of the theory of solid
solutions, which they convey, it seems well to indicate how, as it appears to me, the
value of the theory as an explanatory hypothesis can be exhibited by consideration
of certain data already known.

The method of presentation of the facts enumerated and discussed in {§ 7-17, below,
was suggested to me by a consideration of those thermomagnetic data of Section IV.
which are discussed in Section VIL.

§7. As already stated, the positions of the dotted curves AEFCD in fig. 23
above are in the first instance purely qualitative. The values of GE and GF, for
example, which represent the compositions of the two components of the supposed
eutectic are not known from direct experiment upon artificial alloys; but a study of
the structure of nickel-iron alloys of natural origin (‘ meteoric” and “ terrestrial”)
strongly supports the view that the equilibrium curves are of the general form given

in the figure.
