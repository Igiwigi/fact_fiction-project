The values of N/A? were in
fact far from constant. This was put down to experimental error, although there were hints that
N/A? decreased with increasing atomic weight [40]. The concept that the order number of an element in the periodic table in fact determined the
nuclear charge first emerged from a re-analysis of the Geiger-Marsden scattering data performed
by Antonius van den Broek [41]. Van den Broek was an obscure Dutch lawyer and econometrician,
who had over the years developed his own ideas as how to best organize the periodic table, but
who remained out of the scientific mainstream [42]. The key papers introducing the idea of atomic
number focused on scattering data for Cu, Ag, Sn, Pt and Au that had been measured using both
‘Radium C’ (the bismuth isotope oi Bi) and ‘Radium Emanation’ (the radon isotope 222Rn) as the
sources for the «-particles.
