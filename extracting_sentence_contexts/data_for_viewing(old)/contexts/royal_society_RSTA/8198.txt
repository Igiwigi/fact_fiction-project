and this is a perfect differential.
Since the change is reversible, the increase of entropy of the element is a perfect
differential. But

If further the change is isothermal, we see from the fact that (1-771) and (1-772) are

perfect differentials that 2% 3¢,, is a perfect differential. Hence, there is a function

Again, ¢,, and é,, are regarded as formally distinct in the differentiation of W, and we
assume that W is expressed symmetrically in terms of e,, and é,,.
