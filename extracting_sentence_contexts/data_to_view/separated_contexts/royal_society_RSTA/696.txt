2-level atoms were “created” by light beams. I/we have results we cannot explain at the moment. If you can explain them your name can immediately go on a paper.’ In fact, this was easy for me
to do, because I had spent some considerable time working on multi-photon absorption and was
able to recognize the signature of two-photon absorption. I wrote a theoretical background to the
problem and showed how well the data fitted theory. I was a quantum optics researcher again
and the results were immediately publishable [2].
