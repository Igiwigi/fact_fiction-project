As the differences in the habitat
in which most of these larvee and their close allies live have not been properly recorded,
it is not possible to indicate the origin of the umbrella-mouth of these genera. A con-
sideration of the probable conditions under which the funnel of the Megalophrys tadpoles
may have been evolved may throw some light on the origin of the umbrella-mouth in
others. There is no doubt that the tadpoles of Megalophrys pelodytoides and M. hasseltii are
primitive, as compared with the funnel-mouthed tadpoles of the other species, and in
fact they differ very little from the larve of the western genus Pelobates. It has also
been pointed out that the build of these animals is directly correlated with the rapidity
of the current. It is easy to conceive that under the action of the stronger and stronger
current the two lips became broader and developed an increasing number of tooth-rows.
