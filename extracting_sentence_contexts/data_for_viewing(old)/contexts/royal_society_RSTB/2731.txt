will be found that a cat’s or dog’s pancreas, for example, which has the opaque white
appearance of a fully loaded gland has few islets even at the splenic end, while one
which, from some unknown difference in the process of nutrition, has the translucent
grey appearance of the discharged, or partly discharged, gland will show a relatively
greater abundance of islets. Fig. 1, Plate 2, shows part of a section across the
splenic end of a dog’s pancreas, which ‘thas about the average abundance of islets in
that animal. Fig. 2, from a cat, is from a pancreas which contained an unusually
large number of big islets, which, even at the splenic end, are usually rare in the cat.

The structure of the islets, as seen under a high power, is different in the rabbit
from that seen in the cat and dog. The islets in the rabbit stand out less clearly
from the surrounding alveolar tissue than those of the cat and dog. This is due
to the fact that the islet-cells in the rabbit stain fairly well with toluidene-blue,
and better with eosin. The result is a pinkish-purple tint of all the islet-cells.
The same is true of the ductule epithelium of the rabbit. There is no real difficulty,

however, under low or high power, in recognising the islets. They are seen to be
usually of rounded, compact form, and, at first sight, sharply marked off from the
surrounding secretory alveoli. With a high power many of the islets show a division
of the cells, by intervening connective tissue and blood capillaries, into packets which

have a shape strikingly similar to that of the secretory alveoli. In such, an outer
