The indication given by this solution that y’, becomes infinite at the edges of the
plate had not been anticipated, nor does lack of recognition of this fact appear to have
led to appreciable error in the case where & was equal to unity. On the other hand,
the attempted extension to & = 10,000 led to difficulties on this account, which will
now be dealt with. The result of proceeding as for k = 1, with a equal to

is shown by the dotted curve of fig. 6, whilst the smooth curve which satisfied equation
EK (10) to a sufficient degree of approximation is also shown. In the course of several
variations in the choice of angular points and of values of & it was found that the
form of the curve for x, was not uncertain except near the leading edge of the plate,
