The marginal tentacles of Thaumantias are very similar (fig. 3) to the buccal
tentacles of Mesonema ; they consist of an outer membrane, in which numbers of
thread-cells are imbedded, and an inner axis composed of clear cells arranged end to
end; they have a peculiarity, which has been already pointed out by Prof. E. Forses,
in being placed aboye the marginal vesicles instead of being alternate with them, as
in the nearly allied genus Geryonia; and from this fact, and from their totally differ-
ent structure, I believe that they have a totally different origin. In Geryonia the
tentacles belong to the second classâ€”are processes of the circular canal; in Thau-
mantias they are simple processes of the outer foundation membrane, 4. e. of the suh-
stance of the disc. Perhaps this difference in structure among the tentacles may
turn out to be a good means of generic distinction among other members of the
class.
