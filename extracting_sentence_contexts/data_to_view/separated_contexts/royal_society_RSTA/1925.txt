2s 20S Ae. Fe (vE)

All these had ultimately to be rejected, for various reasons: (i.), (ii.) and (iii.)
gave unsatisfactory fits; (iv.) fitted very well for large values of ¢, but showed
systematic divergences for the smaller values; (v.) and (vi.) gave a very good all-over
fit, but exhibited a curious indeterminacy in their constants, widely divergent sets of
constants giving an almost identical curve, so that these constants were obviously
unsuitable elements to define the physical characteristics of the flow.. Moreover, the
fact that formule (ii.) to (vi.) all involve as many as four constants, somewhat reduces
the significance of the fit. Finally, it occurred to us to try to modify the form

S=8-+at"

by adding another term of simple form.
