Children have the ability to represent absent persons before
they have a comprehensive understanding of the biological
inevitability and finality of death. Thus, even toddlers can
think and talk about an absent attachment figure or anticipate
a future reunion [12]. Children’s emerging understanding of
death confronts them with the fact that a separation brought
about by death, unlike everyday separations, will be permanent
rather than temporary. Yet children’s continuing representation
of the deceased is likely to be based on their memory of inter-
actions with the living person—what Boyer [13] describes as
the person-file system—and not just on their memory or rep-
resentation of the insensate corpse. When children receive
testimony about the afterlife, they are effectively offered further
support for their representation of the ‘living person’ as exist-
ing elsewhere.
