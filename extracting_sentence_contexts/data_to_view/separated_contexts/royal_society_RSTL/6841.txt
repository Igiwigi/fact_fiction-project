Emanuel Mendez da Coſta, that
ſome authors mention quarries of this bafaltes in Up-
per and Lower Saxony, and in Sileſia, 1 do not
know, that thoſe in the country of Naſſau, and the
territories of Treves and Colen, have been deſcribed. I thought proper, Sir, to communicate to you
what little I have learned in a journey, in which I
had not time enough to make, upon ſo curious a
ſubje&, all the reſearches, which I could have
wiſhed. One cannot know too many particulars of this
remarkable ſtone, or compare too many of the facts,
which they offer to attentive obſervers, This is the
true method of attaining, if poſſible, ſome know-
ledge of this natural curioſity,

Thoſe, who have made obſervations upon falts; and:
inquiries into ſtones, minerals, and metals, know
how common. cryſtalliſations are in nature,  A-very

great

great variety are found in ſearching mountains, viſit-
ing caverns, and deſcending into mines. There are
few of the naturaliſts, accuſtomed to theſe reſearches,
who ſhall obſerve the baſaltes above-mentioned, but
will be inclined to conſider them as ſo many cryſtal-
lifations. I do not think, that the great extent of
theſe maſſes, which have been diſcovered, and the
bigneſs of the ſtones, which compoſe them, form
any obje&tion againſt this notion. 1 am, with very
great efteem,

SIR,
Your moſt humble

and moſt obedient ſervant,
