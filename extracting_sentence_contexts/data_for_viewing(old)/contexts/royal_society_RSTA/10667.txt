It has already been pointed out that a luminous ring haying become dim and
£ wmost invisible could be momentarily brightened by suddenly destroying the
3 magnetic field. But with the apparatus shown in fig. 6 the following striking results
$ were obtained :—The aluminium band A was positively electrified to a potential of
6000 volts. When the current supplied to the electro-magnets was very slowly
A increased, as much as 1-1 amperes was necessary to produce diselectritication of A,
while on the other hand, if the current were very rapidly increased in value A lost
its charge when only 6 amperes flowed through the coils.

Further than this, it was always noticed that diselectrification occurred when the
magnetic field was suddenly destroyed rather than when it was created. A particular
rarefaction was found for each bulb, such that the band A could be electrified, and,
irrespective of the fact that the electrodes were magnetised, retain its charge. Jn all
such cases the effect of rapidly destroying the magnetic field was to produce diselectri-
Jication, whereas when the current supplied to the magnet coils was broken under water,
and in consequence the magnetic field caused to gradually diminish in strength, no trace
of diselectrification was observed. It was therefore clear that variations in the

strength of the magnetic field played an important part both in the formation of the
luminous ring and also in the diselectrification process.
