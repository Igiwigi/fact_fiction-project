covered in past times by the water. The coast of the south-west shore of the
peninsula Kukturnak is covered entirely with Cockle shells, extending in a band
nearly a mile wide. With the exception of those points in which the cliff rises from
the water's edge, there is always a tract of shore on which shells are found. On the
hypothesis that the Aral Sea formerly had a much greater depth than at present, it
would be expected that shells would be thus found in position for a considerable
height above the present level, but this is not the case. On the contrary, where the
shores are more or less steep the shells are found in great quantities up to a certain
level, about 15 feet above the water, and above this level théy are never found. In
places where the land slopes very gradually to the water level the horizontal extent
of the shell-covered tract is very great, being as much as 15 miles in some places;
but whenever the ground rises suddenly so as to reach a greater height than about
15 feet above the Aral Sea level no more shells are found. The fact that the shells
cease abruptly at a definite horizon is true both in sandy parts of the coast and on the
clayey tracts, and it is equally true of those deposits of shells which occur in the
bottom of valleys opening to the sea which are now altogether dry, but which were
formerly filled by the sea. Some of these deposits of shells reach inland four or five

miles (¢.g., Meregen Sai), but always without any marked rising of the ground; where
any elevation occurs the level at which the shells cease is always definite and striking.

The absence of shells above a definite level seems to suggest that the sea has never
