I shall now pass over from the shores of the Baltic to the opposite coast of Sweden
between Uddevalla and Gothenburg, a district from 250 to 300 miles south-west of
that before described, and about three degrees of latitude farther south. 'The deposits
containing recent shells at Uddeyalla, raised in some spots to the height of more than
two hundred English feet above the sea, have long been celebrated ; as also the dis-
covery, made by M. ALExanprs BroxGNlarr, of barnacles attached to elevated rocks
of gneiss on the spots where they must have grown. I was desirous of seeing this
phenomenon, as it appeared to me that it might throw some light on the time which
has elapsed since the shelly beds were raised from the sea; for if the Balani had been
exposed in the open air eyer since the emergence of the rocks to which they were
fixed, it could hardly be supposed that the time had been indefinitely great, since in
that case the shells must have heen decomposed. The fact recorded by M. BroNGNIarm
was, I believe, observed at Capellbacken, immediately south of Uddevalla, where there
is a narrow valley in the gneiss, the bottom of which is filled up with a great deposit
of shells, sand, and clay, which rise, according to HisIxces, at their greatest eleva-
