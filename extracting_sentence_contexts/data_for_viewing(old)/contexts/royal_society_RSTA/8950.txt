KrF. —The F lines form parallel series in which the constant separations depend on
the satellite separations of the D series. In other words the limits are the d (1)
sequents which form the satellites. Now it has been shown above that the abnormal
triplet separations which the D series exhibit is probably due to the fact that the d
sequent for a given satellite triplet is not the same for each of the three lines, but
that they are subject to a displacement of one or more ouns. For instance where », is
788 in place of 786 (in round numbers) the difference 2 is due to the fact that d,, is
not equal to d,, but is d,,(6,). If the strongest line is to be. taken as normal, we
should expect the d,,, or d,, to be normal rather than 'd,, as D,, is always weaker
than the other lines of a triplet satellite. In this case F, (0) =d,,(d,) and the
F separation = F,,(0)—F, (0) = d,,,(6,)—d,, which is less than the observed satellite
separation by about 2. As a fact we do find these diminished separations. In
searching for F lines therefore we have to examine the spectrum for wave-lengths
longer than d,, and showing as multiplets with separations the same as the satellite
separations or less. In the particular case of Kr these are 100, 105, 133, 213, 307,
1048, 1860,* and we are to expect series which we will denote by F, with 2 from 1 to 8.
