The climate of Greenland was probably comparable with that of Southern Europe
to-day : genera that are now characteristic members of tropical floras, the floras which
are in part legacies from the Cretaceous age, were then represented by species less sensitive
than their modern descendants to external factors.* Such climatic changes as seem to be
demanded by Paleeobotanical evidence can be accounted for without calling to our aid
explanations based on purely hypothetical departures from the order of nature.
