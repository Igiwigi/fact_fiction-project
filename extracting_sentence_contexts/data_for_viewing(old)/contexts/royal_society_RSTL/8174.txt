any point, and they intersect orthogonally in their eight points of intersection.

Demonstration. Let P be the given point, P' the inverse of P with respect to the
circle through the four common foci, then through the four common foci can be
described two sphero-conics touching the great circle which bisects PP perpendicularly ;
these will be the focal sphero-conics of the required sphero-quartics,

that from any point can be drawn concyclic planes which will intersect the planes of
the nodal conics of Z in four tetragrams circumscribed to the nodal conics. Now if the
points from which the four concyclic tangent planes are drawn be the pole of the plane
of one of the nodal conics (that is, in fact, if it be one of the four centres of inversion of
the sphero-quartic), the proposition is evident.
