Repeated viewing of any of the three surfaces in etc., which can in principle cause sizable changes in the cue
figure 1 does not seem to produce any detectable changes strength. In the examples of figure 1, the nuisance variable
in their perceived 3D structure. This is also echoed in the affecting the texture cue is the material composition of the
fact that the perceived shape of objects in the real world objects and the nuisance variable affecting the shading cue
appears stable and unambiguous and does not appear to is the illumination condition. The new theory, name Intrinsic
change over successive viewings. In this paper, I will describe Constraint (IC) theory, postulates that processing of indepen-
a new theory of cue integration that does not require any of dent depth modules and their combination thereof, is done in
the assumptions of the probabilistic inference model of a way to minimize the sensitivity to nuisance parameters
depth cues and depth-cue integration.
