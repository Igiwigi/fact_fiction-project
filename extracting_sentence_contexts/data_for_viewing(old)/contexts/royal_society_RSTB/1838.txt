not been directly observed, but it seems highly probable that it is by radial slits,
which opened upon the small dimple-like depression at the apex. The whole sorus
is strongly suggestive of that of a Kaulfussia, with a smaller number of loculi, and
much narrowed apical depression, while the obscure slits of dehiscence of the modern
genus, and the absence of any annulus would correspond to the condition of this fossil.
Prest has grouped this genus with Kaulfussia, but Srur (loc. cit., p. 720) rejects
this on the ground of the form of the leaf, which is closely similar to that of Marattia
Kaulfussii (J. Su.); and he accordingly founded the special group Asterotheces.
But to those who fully recognise how greatly the outline and character of the leaves
of modern living ferns may vary within the single genus, this point would seem to be
over estimated, I see in it no sufficient reason for separating the Asterotheces from
Kaulfussia. In any case the correspondence between the sori seems to be a peculiarly
close one. It may be noted that Asterotheca is a relatively early form,{ a fact which
has its importance.

Ptychocarpus (= Diplazites, Goer.) hevastichus appears to have sori of a similar
type to Asterotheca,§ but the sori are placed “in several rows on both sides of the
median nerve in each pinna,”|| a condition which has its interest for comparison with

Kaulfussia.
