898 MR. C. DE MORGAN ON THE STRUCTURE AND

While no doubt the hairs have other and mechanical offices to fulfil, it would be
difficult to 8nggest any use besides that of ministering to sensation which could demand
their close and direct union with the living neryous and vascular membrane.

This view derives great support from the fact of the existence of a structure within
the claw of the larger crustaceans, which, 80 far as the author can learn, has not hitherto
been described.

It is generally stated that the claw is entirely filled with the muscular apparatus
belonging to it, but this is by no means the case. Neither the moveable piece or index,
nor the part of the tarsus which it opposes, the pollex, contain any muscular tissue.
The flexor and extensor of the index, terminate at the level of the joint of the pincer,
where the tendon is inserted, and all below this level is filled with a spongy mass
similar in structure to that of the internal integument. Into this mass the nerves of
the limb principally pass. The muscles are supplied almost entirely by a small branch,
while the principal nerve divides at about the level of the penultimate joint into two
trunks, which pass down one towards each limb of the claw, and then break up into
