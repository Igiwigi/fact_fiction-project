any of the valley-gravels. This is generally more removed from the river-
valleys than shown in these plans.

The valley-gravels are here divided into two stages only. Each stage,
however, must, be considered to represent not one exact level, but the several '
nearly allied terraces formed during a particular time. It may be assumed,
for example, that the high-level gravels include all the terraces at heights

of from 90 to 150 feet above the river, and the low-level gravels those up
to 30 or 40 feet above the river. In fact, no definite line can properly be
| drawn, as all the terraces are members of one series: nevertheless it is not
| only for the sake of convenience that this division is adopted; it is to a
great extent conformable to the phenomena as they exist ; for the great bulk
of these quaternary gravels occur, one portion on terraces at or near 100
feet above the Somme, and another portion at or near 30 feet. The gravels

| on both levels, especially the lower one, are often covered by Loessâ€”the low-
bd level gravel being constantly buried under it and hidden, whilst both Loess
S= and gravel disappear under the recent alluvium. The heights are taken in
5 part from the French Ordnance Maps; the others are from observations I
ny have taken with the aneroid barometer. The general topographical outlines
S of the districts are also taken from the French Ordnance Maps.
