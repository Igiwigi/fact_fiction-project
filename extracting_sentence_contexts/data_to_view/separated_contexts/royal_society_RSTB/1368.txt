As I have stated, the action of dilute
mineral acids (such as sulphuric and hydrochloric) upon it, is solely to produce
epidoporphyrin, and the latter substance yields no murexide reaction. But, if the
ellow pigment be carefully oxidised with warm dilute nitric acid, no more of the re-
agent being used than is sufficient to decolorize the solution, colourless erystais of
aric acid may be obtained on cooling. From the above facts it would seem to be at
east probable that the difference between uric acid and the pigment is one of
idation. That the relation between them is a simple one is further suggested by
biological evidence. Slight climatic influences may so affect metabolism in the pupa that yellow takes
he place of white in the wings.
