The outer boundary of the discharge from the positive is less bright than the fluores-
cent glow of the tube, as was the case with a discharge in air. Plate 10, fig. 19,
shows the phenomena of the discharge in tube 200 at the same pressure, with a current
of 0:03071 W; this exemplifies well the influence of the diameter of the tube on the
phenomena of stratification. In fact, in tube 199 we have not yet succeeded in
obtaining a steady stratification, while in tubes of a less diameter perfectly steady
strata are always obtained, although their form and number depend partly on the
dimensions of the tube, Part II., fig. 62a, p. 209. Pressure 2 m.m., 2632 M, 6300 cells, current 0:04686 W. Strata for three-fourths
of the length of the tube, commencing at the positive in a point and enlarging to
about half the diameter of the tube as it approached the negative.
