This Tauberian theorem is the result of developments over a period of almost 10 years. In the

special case p = oo and K =M, it was first obtained by Batty & Duyckaerts [76]. In that case, the
function Mx(s) = M(s)(log(1 + M(s)) + log(1 + s)) is often denoted by Miog. It is the achievement
of Batty, Borichev & Tomilov [66] to extend the basic result from [76] and the classical Ingham—

Karamata-Riesz theorem to general p and to allow functions K of the form (1 + s)“M(s)8 (for some
a, B > 0) instead of just K = M. In this case, Mx and Miog do not differ essentially. There is also an


extensive discussion in [66, Section 4] of the fact that more general functions K are possible, too. In
fact, there are sometimes non-trivial relations between the functions M and K, and the interplay
between the shape of 2y and the growth of f in 2y can be analysed by means of more or less
standard techniques of complex analysis, such as the theory of harmonic measure. For instance,
if M(s) = C(1 + s)* and iff grows polynomially in 2y, then, as was noted in [77, Lemma 3.4], one
necessarily has FI <Ce(1 + |z|%**) for all z € cy for an appropriate constant c > 1. Theorem 3.2
in its full generality was finally proved in an unpublished manuscript by Stahn [78, Theorem 1.1];
see also [79].

Regardless of p, Theorem 3.2 is optimal in the sense that one cannot obtain any better weights
in (3.3) than Mg. Optimality for p= oo and polynomial M = K was proved in [77, Theorem 3.8]
by an explicit and fairly involved construction. By developing further the ideas from [77], this
approach was then extended to all p and to some other functions M (and also to individual orbits
of Hilbert space semigroups) in [66, Sections 5 and 7], and in [78, Theorem 4.1] for an even larger
