species-specific preferences for specific plant pollen hosts in
solitary bees may, among other factors, explain the highly
species-specific microbial communities observed, e.g. in
megachilid bees [36]. In fact, different flowering plant

(a) Study sites and species

In 2017, bee and larval provision samples were collected from
trap nests installed on grassland plots located in three geographic
regions (nine plots per region at least 0.4 km apart from each

species show distinct microbial communities [41,42] and the other and a mean of 11.5 km within regions) of Germany, i.e.
beta-diversity of floral microbiota is usually higher between the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve Schorfheide-Chorin (SCH) in
flowers of different plant species than between flowers of the northeast of Germany, the National Park Hainich-Diin
