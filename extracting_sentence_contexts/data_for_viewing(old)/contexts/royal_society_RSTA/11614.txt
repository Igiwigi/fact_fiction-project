MR. A. MALLOCK ON EXPERIMENTS ON FLUID VISCOSITY. 45

Only a few experiments were made with this arrangement, as the motion of the fluid
was eddying and unstable, even at very low velocities.

Diagram 10 gives the coefficient of viscosity in terms of temperature, as deduced
from the experiment of series (1) and (3). With these results, for the sake of
comparison, I have drawn the curve representing the true value of the coeflicient
(taken from Professor Everert’s C.G.S. units).

What the origin of the high values found for the coefficient by my experiments is,
T am not at present in a position to explain, but from the fact of the inoment trans-

qnitted by the fluid being directly proportional to the velocity, I do not think it can
She put down to eddy-makimg in the ordinary sense of the word, or, if due to
ormation of isolated eddies, the magnitude of and rate at which such eddies are
“dormed must be such as to keep the totai transmitted moment (at any rate very
foearly) proportional to the velocity.
a As bearing on this point the curves of Diagram 11 have been introduced. These
“purves are actual tracings by the camera-lucida of the angular motion of the divided
<tirele on cylinder A during portions of four experiments.

‘Suspended cylinder A remains nearly stationary, the chief movement being a slight
Eharmonie oscillation of about fifteen seconds’ period (the period of the suspended
