The entodermal area (a) whose limit is defined in the figure by the contour-line
a.0.p. may thus be identified as defining an “area pellucida,” over against a
surrounding “area opaca.” In the sections these two regions are marked off from
one another with tolerable abruptness, in the same manner as in the succeeding
stage, the “postgastrular,” to be described later. That the differentiation in

the fact that the more or less accidental presence of a layer of yolk-spheres, adherent
to its deep surface, had masked the distinction between the entoderm of the area
pellucida and the surrounding more heavily yolk-laden entoderm.
