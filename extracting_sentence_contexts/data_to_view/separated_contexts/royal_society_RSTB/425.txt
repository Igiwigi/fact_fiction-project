Execitable or Pyramidal, Fronto-Parietal_—This is the collection of fibres
commonly known as the pyramidal tract, and which on being stimulated produce
movement in a distinctive manner. Strictly speaking, the term pyramidal tract
should apply only to those fibres contained in the pyramids, 7.e., those for the muscles
of the limbs and trunk. In fact, many authors divide the “ motor” capsular fibres
into two groups, one devoted to the cerebral nerves, and the other termed the
pyramidal fibres. This distinction we consider fair, but the term pyramidal tract
has been so extended as to include these two groups of so-called motor fibres. But,
while we agree in general to this distinction, it must not be forgotten that these two
sets of fibres are not in utterly distinct compartments, but that the area of each
overlaps.
