any worse off in this respect. It seems as if all Mammals have binocular vision, but
that they do not rely entirely on it. It is a remarkable fact that, if we except Man and the Simi, Mammals very rarely
move their eyes for the purposes of vision. When they wish to look in any other
direction than the primary one, they move their heads instead. This not only places
them in a more favourable position as regards attack or defence, but the movement of
the head seems a simpler motion than that of the eyes, so that notwithstanding the
high development of â€˜the ocular muscles, the former motion is alone resorted to until
the stage of convergence is reached, and this is co-existent with the macula.
