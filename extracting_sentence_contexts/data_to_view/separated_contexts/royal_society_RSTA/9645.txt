With this, the subsidiary values become 180°90+ ‘1
and 90°45+'05. Tt is seen that in the doublet groups all the elements can come within this limit. In fact, with the exception of K and Ga, they come extremely close. Ga is
spectroscopically uncertain as well as in its atomic weight, and the uncertainty of K
is due to the uncertainty in its value of ». In the triplet groups also, all calculated
from A,+A, have possible variations which will bring them within, although the
closeness is not so marked as for the doublet elements.
