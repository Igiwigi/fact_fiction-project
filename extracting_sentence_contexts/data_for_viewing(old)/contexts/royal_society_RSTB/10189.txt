Figure 3. The effect of increasing speciation relative to extinction rates on the time of emergence of crown groups relative to their total groups (y-axis). Each line
Tepresents an extinction rate with the x-axis providing the corresponding speciation rate. Note that some values are slightly offset from their x-value to avoid blurring
of error bars; the only real positions on the x-axis are 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9.

emergence of crown group (fraction of full time) at varying long stem-groups, for this would imply that there would have

‘waxing—waning’ model, where diversification rates are
initially high and then decline through time (fig. 1 of [38];
but see also [42] for documentation of the reverse pattern in
post-Palaeozoic echinoids). What effect this would have on
crown (relative to total) group appearance is rather unclear,
