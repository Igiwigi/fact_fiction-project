Even allowing for the exaggeration of
experimental error by the nature of the equation connecting 8 and y, it can no}
said that the intramolecular energy is proportional to the number of atoms in
molecule. The paraffins themselves and their monohalogen derivatives sho
closest approximation, but even in their case the quotient appears to increase
increases. This last fact and the extract below from an article by Professor J. J. Tow
(Warts, ‘ Dictionary of Chemistry,’ vol. 1, p. 89), suggest another relation among ,
f’s that looks more promising. The extract in question is as follows :—*
there is strong evidence against the truth of the theorem (7.e., Bourzmann’s '
in this form, and the mathematical proof of it is unsatisfactory, yet a very sp
case of it is probably true, viz., that if we have a molecule consisting of n at
approximately symmetrically arranged (that is, if the distance between a pe
pair of atoms is not always very much less than the distances between the ¢
pairs), then the ratio of the mean total kinetic energy of the molecule to the en
due to the translatory motion of the centre of gravity is proportional to n, the nut
of atoms in the molecule.” Tf then the molecules of the gases I have investigated are symmetrical in the ¢
sense, we ought to find (8 + 1)/n constant.
