At present the instrument is mounted on a hard
smooth slab of concrete, which reposes on a sandstone pillar resting on the concrete
on which the floors are laid. The coil system is mounted on a sheet of ebonite
supported by insulators on the concrete slab, and the controlling magnet system is
supported by leaden pillars passing through the ebonite without touching it, and also
resting on the concrete slab. The natural stiffness of the slab, or rather its inertia,
is much increased by the fact that it carries the magnetic shield of cast iron weighing
about three hundred pounds. This materially lessens any tendency there might be
to produce disturbance in the suspended system by adjusting the controlling magnets. The Magnetic Control.â€”The whole secret of success lies in this.
