even more strongly impregnated with suIphur, as I saw
proved by direct experiment. The other example occurs at Las Escaldas, on the
southern declivity of the Eastern Pyrenees, where a most efficacious cold sulphureous
spring rises within about one hundred yards of a hot one. When to these facts we
add others scarcely less curious, of springs of totally different mineral composition
issuing from nearly the same spot, and with temperatures from 160? to 180? Fanr.,
as we sce at Ax and at Thuez, we are forced to conclude that the sonrce of minerali-
zation must be independent to a great extent of that of high temperature, and that
the arguments as to the origin of thermal springs founded upon their chemical com-
position must be to a certain degree fallaciousFÃž.
