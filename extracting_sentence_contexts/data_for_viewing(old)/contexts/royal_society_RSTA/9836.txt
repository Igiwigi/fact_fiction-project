prolonged annealing followed by quenching has been adopted throughout and details
of the evidence obtained in this way, particularly with regard to the lines GH and
HD, will be given below.

The line EBF, both as regards temperature and as regards the position of the
point B, agrees closely with the eutectic line shown in SHEPHERD’s diagram, but an
important difference is found with regard to the end of this line on the aluminium
side. On referring to the cooling-curves in figs. 1 and 2, it will be found that the
arrests along the line EBF are still marked in Nos. 78 and 76, yet the eutectic line in
the diagram is drawn only to the point F, corresponding to a concentration of 78°3
per cent. of aluminium.

The reason for this discrepancy lies in the fact that although alloys cooled with
moderate rapidity exhibit a eutectic heat evolution to a considerable distance to the
right of the point F, yet both microscopically and pyrometrically this eutectic can
be made to disappear entirely by exposing the alloys to a temperature of about
430° C. for a considerable period of time.

In order to establish this point, ingots of a series of alloys lying on either side of
the point F were maintained for about 100 hours at a temperature near 430° C., and
cooling-curves of these ingots were subsequently taken at a rate similar to that
described for the series of curves illustrated in figs. 1 and 2, the observations being
taken from a temperature of 430° C. to about 200° C. The curves of alloys, Nos. 80,
78, and 75, are shown in fig, 5, the curves marked a, b, and c being those taken by
ordinary slow cooling from fusion, while those marked d, e, and f are those taken
