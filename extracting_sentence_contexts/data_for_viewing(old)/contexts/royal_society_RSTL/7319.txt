636 MR. W. H. FLOWER ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND

XXX. fig. 4). The broad deciduous molar teeth were still in place (coloured red). On
removing part of the alveolar wall, the calcified crowns of their snccessors (coloured blue)
were seen, the upper one less advanced than the lower, and, as in the other genera
described, placed rather anteriorly to the tooth it was destined to sueceed. The form
of the crowns of these reserve teeth was quite different from their molariform prede-
cessors, being in fact that of the third premolars of the adult (Plate XXX. fig. 5),

The true molars had begun to take their place in the jaw, two in the maxilla and
four in the mandible on each side, having their crowns calcified. Except those men-
tioned above no traces of reserve or successional teeth were seen.

We thus find in this American family of Marsupials precisely the same peculiarity in
the snccession of the teeth as noticed in their Australian congeners. TI have been careful
to verify these observations upon several other members of the genus, being unable to
reconcile them with the figure given by Professor OwEx of the lower jaw of a Didelphys
with two reserve premolar teeth, below the crowns of teeth, which, though showing the
triangular pointed form of the permanent premolars, are indicated as the molar teeth of
the deciduous series*.
