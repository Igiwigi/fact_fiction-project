of 5ea waters, in different parts of the ocean, &c. 16g

Edinburgh, * Dr. Joun Davy, now of Ceylon, and M. Gay-Lussac,] have also added many useful facts to this
part of natural science. These two last observyers, in particular,
have given the specific gravities of waters in a variety of lati-
tudes, from England -to Ceylon, and from South America to
France, and their results appear to lead to the general conclu-
sion, that the variations obtained in those parts of the ocean
were but very slight, and are to be ascribed rather to acci-
dental causes than to any general principle. The immediate objects of investigation which presented
themselves to me were, first, to ascertain the specific.gravities
of upwards of seventy specimens of sea water which I had
procured Å¿rom different parts of the world; and afterwards to
examine whether any differences could be traced in the chemi-
cal composition of those waters.
