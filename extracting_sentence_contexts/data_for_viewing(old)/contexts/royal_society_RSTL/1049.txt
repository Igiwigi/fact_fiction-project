It might at first view be supposed, that when a conductor
placed in the circuit left a residuum of electricity in any- bat-
tery, increase of the power of the battery, or of its surface,
would not enable it to carry through any additional quantity.
This, however, is far from-being the case.,

When saline solutions were placed in''the. circuit of a bat-
tery of 20 plates, though they discharged a very-small quan-
tity only of the electricity, when the troughs-were only full,
yet their chemical-decomposition exhibited-the fact of a much

larger quantity passing through them, when the cells were
filled with fluid.

And a similar circumstance occurred with respect to a wire
of platinum, of such a length as to leave a considerable resi-
duum in a battery when only half its surface was used ; yet
when the whole surface was employed, it became much
hotter, and nevertheless left a still more considerable resi-
