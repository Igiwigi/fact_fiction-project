command, Further sub-division into species was attempted in the case of Group I
and Group I. was divided into the two well-defined sub-groups of nebulz and bright
line stars. In the case of the other groups, a finer division was not possible from th
available facts. Group II. was originally divided into fifteen species from a consideration of the
observations. Since the photographs open up the blue for our investigation,
sub-division may be based on extent of the fluting-absorptions in the way which wi
