Moreover, our econometric model solely involves ex-ante
market knowledge. Third, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying the influence of
neighbouring 15-min contracts on the price dynamics of a given contract. This is motivated by
the fact that adjacent contracts are driven by similar market information. This paper is organized as follows: in ยง2, we lay out our dataset and perform an empirical
analysis of intraday transaction data of 15-min contracts. In ยง3, we present our econometric model


as well as the threshold regression.
