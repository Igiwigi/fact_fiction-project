ago [48,49], PdeR and Pde are active PDEs now termed ‘trigger PDEs’, whose function as c-di-GMP sensing effectors has only been recently characterized [30,50]
and is described in detail in §85 and 6, respectively. Note that the array of c-di-GMP-responsive effector components is not exhaustive, but those mentioned here
have been chosen to represent different families of proteins.
