As to the second we are ignorant of its
© formula, and it is pretty certain that it will depend on powers of the sine and cosine
2 of incidence and (at least for the concave) on the curvature. If we knew its exact
S, form we could integrate the differential which they form and geb the impulse and
EZ resistance for a given 6, and multiplying this by d0, and again integrating from 0 to
8, 7 we should find their mean values. Of the terms in this last integration those which
= have 8? 0 as a factor disappear ; mr? (the surface) will be a factor of the others,

£ among which ay be the three first powers of = ; and these may produce the change

2 (80.) In paragraph (41) I inferred from the work with the whirling machine that
= with 9” cups the z is the same for 24” and 12” arms ; but what precedes shows that
Q this is not the fact, and that each type of anemometer has a special a, I would
therefore suggest to meteorologists and opticians the propriety of confining them-
8elves to two types: one for fixed instruments, the other for portable ones. For the
first the Kew type should, I think, be adopted ; if the determination of its constants,
given in paragraph (70), be not thought sufficiently exact, there would be little
difficulty in making more observations like those described there, and under more

#=2'0709 less than in No. 4, but 80 large as to make it evident that there must be 80me other cause of
the increased value of #.
