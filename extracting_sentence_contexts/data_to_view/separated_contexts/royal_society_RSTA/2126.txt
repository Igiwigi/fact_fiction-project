Skewness in the same direction, but gradually diminishing, is also seen in curves
BB, CC and DD. But in DD it is very slight, and in EE it has changed its type, the
character figures for the days subsequent to the crest being now a shade less than those
for the corresponding days preceding it. The fact that, in these five cases, the last three
of the character figures for days n + 3 and all the character figures for days n — 8 fall
below the normal is not really strange. We have collected in column » the outstanding
disturbed days of the month, and this tends to reduce below the normal the character
figures in all the other columns. ‘The mean character figures for days n — 1, n + 1 and
n -- 2 exceed the normal only because of the tendency for disturbed and quiet days to
occur in groups.
