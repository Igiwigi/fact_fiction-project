therefore, when viewed by transmitted light, appear like four thick fibres. The vesicle
is about 55th of an inch in diameter, more spherical in small than in large indiyi-
duals; it contains a closely-packed mass of strongly-refracting granules 555th of an
inch, more or less, in diameter. 'The outer membrane of the pedicle can be traced
over the vesicle, and the inner probably passes under it, separating the cavity of the
pedicle from the vesicle : the dense mass of granules prevents this from being actually
seen, but from analogy with Mesonema, &c., I have no doubt of the fact. 28. ExrENBERG, in his description of the Medusa aurita, says, Â© Le p6doneule
est attach6 & une v6sicule, dans lequel on remarque, sous le microscope, un corps
glanduleux, jaundtre lorsque la lumitrele traverse et blanchatre lorsque cette dernidre
est r6fl6chie.
