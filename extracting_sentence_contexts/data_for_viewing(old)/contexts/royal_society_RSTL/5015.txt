system are produced before the floating cells are generated in the chylaqueous fluid.
The conclusion is evident. In the young Annelid the agency of the floating corpuscles
of the chylaqueous fluid is not required either for the elaboration of the fibrine or the
production of the pigment of the blood-proper. But it is important to guard against

the apparent continuation of this inference, that what is true of the young is 80 also
of the old. In relation to the history of the solid elements of the chylaqueous fluid
in the Annelids, another fact of equal value and significance with the former may
here be mentioned. For some time before the death of the old worm, whether the
death take place by fission of the body into fragments, or by general decay and
decomposition, the corpuscles of the chylaqueous fluid go on gradually disappearing.
The ova and sperm-cells accumulated in the fluid of the visceral cavity during the
eason of reproduction, also supersede, to a great extent, the proper corpuscles of
this fluid. At this period however the blood-system acquires a very conspicuously
augmented development.

In studying the histology of the solid elements of the fluids in the Invertebrata, it
is desirable to forearm the observer with one admonition. When these bodies dehisce
under the eye in the field of the microscope, the semifluid contents are projected out
in strings or filaments ; the highly fibrinous fluid contained in the cells coagulates
