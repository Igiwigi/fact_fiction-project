with this single remark ; that if decompoxsition by the voltaic battery depended
upon the attraction of the poles, or the parts about them, being stronger than
the mutual attraction of the particles separated, it would follow that the weak-
est electrical attraction was stronger than, if not the strongest yet, very srong
chemical attraction, namely, such as exists between oxygen and hydrogen,
potassium and oxygen, chlorine and sodium, acid and alkali, &c., a conse-
quence which, although perhaps not impossible, seems in the present state of
the subject yery unlikely.

507. The view which M. pz La Rive has taken (489.), and also MM, Ris-
FAULT and Cyomest (485), of the manner in which electro-chemical decomposi-
tion is effected, is very different to that already considered, and is not affected
by either arguments or facts against the latter. Considering it as stated by the
former philosopher, it appears to me to be incompetent to account for the experi-
ments of decomposition against surfaces of air (462, 469.) and water (495.),
which I have described; for if the physical differences between metals and humid
conductors, which M. pz La Rive supposes to account for the transmission of
the compound of matter and electricity in the latter, and the transmission of the
electricity only with the rejection of the matter in the former, be allowed for a
moment, still the relation of air to metal is, electrically considered, 80 small,
that instead of the former replacing the latter (462.), an effect the yery reyerse
might have been expected. Or if eyen that were allowed, the experiment with
water (495.), at once sets the matter at rest, the decomposing pole being now
of a substance which is admitted as competent to transmit the compound of
electricity and matter.
