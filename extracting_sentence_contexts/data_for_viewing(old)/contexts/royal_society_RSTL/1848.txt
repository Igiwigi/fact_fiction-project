goat-suckers, whose mode of nesting corresponds with the
relation given, and whose appearance might be mistaken for
them by one not perfectly conversant with the plumage and
the general appearance of cuckoos when on the wing. Is it
probable that the cuckoo, which is invariably a polygamist,
and never pairs, nests, or incubates in this part of the island,
should fall into opposite habits in another part ?

To recapitulate the substance of my observations. I have
ftirst adduced some arguments in support of migration, the
fact itself not being generally admitted by naturalists of ce-
lebrity, and also against the hypothesis of a state of torpor,
or what may be termed the hybernating system. I have
represented that the s8wallow tribe, and many other birds

time that any inference drawn from this fact in support

cal principles. That certain periodical changes of the testes
