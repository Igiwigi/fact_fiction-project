Thus, the process is variable or resource independent. Similarly, equipment
options are installed for control and heat treatment operations. It is important to reinforce here the fact that all product information related to the UTP
(material, operating modes, list of alternative equipment) is stored in cyber space at the second


level depicted in figure 1. The history of the workpiece in accordance with the WTP is also
accumulated in this level.

(b) Integrated multiscale modelling and simulation for the injection moulding process

In the development of the simulation model of the injection moulding process, the production
system is considered on three levels: technological operation level, manufacturing process level
and production process level [15]. On the level of technological operations, CAD, CAM and CAE class systems are used for the
digital manufacturing preparation.
