If a, b, c, d represent the damping coefficients calculated from the two values of 6
(0, and @,) for each of these four sets of conditions, the attached scheme gives the
connection between the conditions and the coefficients in each case. The four coefficients were found to differ considerably among 0° 180°
themselves, but by amounts which varied much from one deter-
mination of the R effect to another; and as the damping m+ | « ¢
coefficient depends on the controlling force to which the
suspended system is subjected, and part of this force is due to /'~
the very variable amount of the earth’s horizontal field which
remains unneutralised, we first of all eliminated the effect of this particular cause of
variation from a, b, ¢, d. Owing to the fact that the damping coefficients calculated from /, hk, were equally
affected by this cause the elimination was easily made by reducing the values of a, b,
c, d, to what they would have been if the /, , coefficients had been constant and equal
to their mean value. and it is to these reduced values that reference is made in what
follows. The differences between a, b, c, d (which were found to persist after this reduction
had been made) were sometimes positive and sometimes negative ; and the first question
to be settled was whether they were the result of pure accident or of something more.
