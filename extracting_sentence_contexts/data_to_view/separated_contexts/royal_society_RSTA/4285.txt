The following set of experiments was first carried out. It was afterwards found not to be altogether satisfactory on account of the neces-
sity in these cases of superposing two photographs, and taking the resultant effect
to be proportional to the sum of the separate ones. The experiments, however, are
of some interest in revealing this fact: that when considerable differences in inten-
sities have to be dealt with the resultant effect of superposing two photographs is
not proportional to their sum. (It has not been considered necessary to reproduce
these particular photographs here.) | Captain Apnzy has previously shown that this
is so.
