When the applied load is sufficiently great to ensure that yield occurs in some length of
the beam, the function F(x) varies with x in this region, since as discussed in part I both
Aand B are functions of the primary bending moment and therefore of x when the beam has
partially yielded. For flexure in the yield range F(x) cannot be expressed in a manner
suitable for differentiation, so that it is necessary to integrate equation (15-3), giving

F(x) S94 2% = Pf (2) (15-4)
where ke) = eae dd.

By considering the end conditions it will be seen that the arbitrary constant of integration
a assumes the value 0 for the case of a central concentrated load, and 1 for the case of
acantilever. The utility of equation (15-4) lies in the fact that C/A, is usually small. With the
numerical values adopted for the case of pure bending, C/A, = 0-023. The term /, (x) is
therefore small, and can be estimated with sufficient accuracy from a rough guess of the
mode of Â¢.

(b) Solution by finite difference approximations

The eigen-value y in equation (15-4) may readily be determined by using finite difference
approximations to the first and second derivatives of 6. The work was facilitated by the use
of the method described by Fox (1947). In this method a preliminary estimate of the mode is
formed by neglecting all but the first, dominant, term in the infinite series of finite differences
for the derivatives. From this mode numerical values of the subsequent terms in the series
are calculated, and these values are then incorporated to form an improved estimate of the
