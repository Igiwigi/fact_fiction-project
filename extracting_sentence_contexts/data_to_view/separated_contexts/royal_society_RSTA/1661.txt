Two phenomena are intermingled here. The
issuing tide from the Yellow Sea comes down this coast, but there is also a definite
tidal wave that travels into and out of the large bend in the coast whose extremities
are Shan-tung promontory and Shanghai. This is shown by the fact that along the
northern part of this bend, on which Tsing-tao stands, the current flows northwards
while the tide is ebbing both along this coast and in the northern part of the
Yellow Sea. Thus in this bay the main tide is the local tide of the bay itself and
not the general tide of the Yellow Sea. The currents produced by these tides are
rotary, probably an effect of the earthâ€™s rotation ; and it seems that the northward
component of the velocity is small.
