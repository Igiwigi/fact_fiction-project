and relatively small diameter D, containing a strongly absorbing liquid, may
measure the mean horizontal illumination for all azimuths, the total light flux
received being x LD (H, + H,) + LDH,, or xLDH, where H = H, + H, + H,/x
and H,, H, and H, denote respectively the horizontal illumination from the sky, as
reflected, and from the sun. It is obvious that, when the altitude of the sun is large,
direct sunlight does not contribute very much to H, as H, is small since cos « is a
factor. Increased reflexion loss at high obliquity will further reduce the effect of
high-angle light. This must be remembered when interpreting results obtained in
different latitudes. Further, when a tube is standardized against a lamp the effective
area of the tube is only LD, whereas when used to measure H its effective area is = LD.
Such a tube, therefore, measures x (H, +- H,) as far as diffuse skylight and reflected
light are concerned, but for pure sunlight it measures Hy (tz.;, Lcos:a), or 1,
according as it is exposed vertically or normal to the sun’s rays. Thus the fact that
diffuse skylight has at times been found to produce more action on such tubes than
did the direct sunlight does not necessarily mean that the same would be true for a
plane surface.

A fourth definition was the one we originally adopted in our work on submarine
illumination,{ namely the total illumination, I, which measures the total quantity
of light, regardless of angle, received at a point ; this would appear to be the best
for assessing the illumination available for photosynthesis by a unicellular plant in
the ocean, or by the aggregate of the leaves ofa tree. I may be defined as follows :—
let idQ be the illumination in lux due to a small pencil of rays of solid angle d2 on

a small area placed perpendicular to the pencil. Then I = \" idQ, or if we
