skilled experts demonstrate how our species’ adaptability can be stretched
not only by environmental or selective pressures but also by diligent training
regimens. Expert individuals devote themselves in communities of practice to
regimes of intentional bodily cultivation over extended periods with dramatic
neurological, biomechanical and anatomical consequences.

Skilled activity in sport is a complex mix of automated action, refined
attention patterns, sophisticated cognitive strategies and physiological
adaptation, learnt from and developed within social groups (just as complex
behaviours develop in all species albeit in more elaborate form). For this
