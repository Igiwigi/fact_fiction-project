plotted each of their curves with the ordinates reduced in such a proportion in each
case that no part of the curve lies outside the normal curve. As8uming for the
moment that their eyes are not more sensitive than ours for any part of the spectrum,
the difference between the curve of any one of them and the normal will show the
amount and the position in the spectrum of the deficiency in his colour perception.

Observer G.—The firs to whom we call attention is G, who kindly put his eyes
ab our disposal on two occasions for measuring the luminosity of the spectrum.
Reducing the ordinates of his original curve by 4 we obtained a curve which touched
our curve, taken under the same circumstances, in the green, but dropped below it
considerably in the red, and very slightly in the blue-green. Fig. 5, Plate 24, gives
the two curves, the maximum of the normal curve being taken as 100. G's prin-
cipal defect is evidently in the red; in fact, when he matched the luminosity in the
part of the spectrum near C with the candlelight, to our eyes, the shadow illumined
by the spectrum was a brilliant red, whilst that illumined by the candle was nearly
black. There may be a very slight falling off in the blue-green, which on the
trichromatic theory can be accounted for by a light want of sensitiveness in the
© blue-perceiving ” nerves. Apparently, also, his perception of violet is not normal.

He describes it as blue, as if the red element which to us is preent in violet were
unperceived by him.
