856 MR. W. GARDINER ON THE CONTINUITY OF THE

acid. There are two mistakes in that statement. First I should have 8aid © treating
plasmolysed sections :” and what is of more importance, I am inclined to believe
that my observations were not perfectly trustworthy. IT had two particularly plain
instances of an apparent passage of protoplasm through the cell-wall, one of which I
have represented in Plate 70, fig. 38. Although it still seems perfectly clear and
plain, T am almost convinced that some abnormal appearance has been produced, either
by distortion of the section, or owing to the fact that, intersecting the two coloured
protoplasmic threads, are thin pit membranes which I cannot resolve.

As regards plasmolysis, numerous tissues were examined, and in all the same
occurrence of strings was observed. Both Bower and myself believe that the
phenomenon is universal, As definite instances where actual observations were made
I may mention the pulvini of Mimosa, Phaseolus, Rhynasia, Ozalis, Biophytum,
Apios, Desmnodium, Maranta and Marattia ; various roots, e.q., Beta; petioles, e.g.,
Primula and Ficus ; leaves, e.g., Primula ; young endosperm cells, e.g., Rhopalostylis,
Sabal, and Ancuba. Stems and other structures examined from time to time gave
the same results. These results, taken in conjunction with those of Bower, make it.
extremely probable that the same phenomenon is displayed by every living cell
whatsoever,
