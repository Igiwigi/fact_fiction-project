s8equence what part is first touched with it, since it may spread over the surface to
the most snsceptible portion ; there being in reality one part of the egg which is
more susceptible than another. The extremes of susceptibility and insusceptibility
appear to be, on the one hand the centre of the dark, or future upper surface of the
yelk, and on the other that of the white or under surface*,

'That these conclusions, deduced from experiment, are correct, seems to be shown
in the fact, formerly pointed out+, that the germinal vesicle originally, and its pro-
geny subsequently, at the time of fecundation, occupies the centre, not of the entire
egg itself, but of the upper or dark hemisphere of the yelk ; and this possibly may be
the structure to be fecundated.

These facts deserve consideration in connexion with that of the first changes in the
yelk taking place in this hemisphere; first, in the sbrinking of the yelk at this part ;
the formation of the chamber above it, subsequent to fecundation ; the existence of a
canal in its centre, in the margin of which the cleavage of the yelk commences ; and,
lastly, in this being the portion of the yelk in which the first lineaments of the embryo
become apparent.

In connexion with these remarks, it is but jnust to mention that a former observer,
Dr. Marrix Barsy, has distinctly referred to the changed germinal vesicle as being
the structure in which the future embryo, in the Mammalia, originates}.
