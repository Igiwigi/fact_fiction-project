In this change of figure it will be observed that there are three effects ;—
- First, an extension of the fibres or particles, commencing at the neutral axis lm.
and increasing to the upper portion of the beam. © Secondly, a compression of the fibres or particles from the neutral axis to the lower
portions of the beam ; and

Thirdly, the planes or surfaces alc and bmd are forced downwards to the distance ep,
wo and fg.

There are, in fact, two distinct changes of figure :—

-Ehere is the change produced by the tension and compression, which, if acting alone,
ould result in the figure efhg; and there is the change produced by curvature, which,
acting alone, would result in the figure {pnorm. The effect produced by the curva-
Ls is, to cause the sides or planes bd and ac to descend parallel to themselves; the
Aect produced by the tension and compression 1s, to cause these planes to turn about
Ke neutral axis.
