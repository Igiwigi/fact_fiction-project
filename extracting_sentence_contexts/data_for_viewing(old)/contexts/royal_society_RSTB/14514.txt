Endnotes

‘Small caps refer to concepts.
Cp. ‘endogenous control’ [1]; ‘controlled semantic cognition’

[2].
These are often called counterfactuals, but their suppositions needn’t
run counter to the facts. They are scenarios we would capture with
subjunctive conditionals, whether or not the antecedent turns out
to be false, e.g. if it were to rain, xyz would happen.
‘In Pietroski’s terminology, word meanings are instructions for how
to access a concept. Which concept is fetched depends on the syntac-
tic structure and grammatical / closed class content of the sentence.
