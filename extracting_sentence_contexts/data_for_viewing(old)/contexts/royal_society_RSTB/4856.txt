we have the double regression integral

[fe (t, t’) ryrp dt dt’,

where 6 is a continuous function of the two epochs ¢ and ?’, just as @ is a continuous
function of ¢ only.

The concept of the regression integral, involving a regression function varying con-
tinuously with the time, is not only of service in displaying in a precise mathematical
form the nature of the relationship which is to be investigated, but when the functions
a and 6 vary with the time relatively slowly, it suggests a statistical procedure by which
values of these functions may be obtained from the data. That the values must change
relatively slowly is apparent from the fact that the state of advancement of the crop,
as indicated either by the time of harvest, or by phenological observations on common
weeds, often varies relatively to the Calendar date by as much as a fortnight.

If, then, T,, T,, T, ... be a series of orthogonal functions of the time, such that
