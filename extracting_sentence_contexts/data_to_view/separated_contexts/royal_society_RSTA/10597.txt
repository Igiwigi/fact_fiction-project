We again find that for the larger values of
H, those portion of the curves which correspond to the larger stresses are straight
lines radiating from a single point—in this case the origin—and thus obtain
W = mB, The values of m and Hy, are given in the table. A ee ene 15°72 | 26°64 | 37-4

Thus, approximately,
W = ‘64 (H, — 6°2)'B,. This expression would naturally fail to represent facts when H, < 6°2. The value of W for zero stress, recorded in § 54, is given closely over the whole
range by W = °57H',B, —1800.

§ 67. We now take the experiments on the effect of tension upon a soft iron wire
described in § 52.
