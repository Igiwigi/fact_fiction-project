the pile which disturbs their contact. TW" HY

Let us then conclude that direct experiment answers negatively to the question
we proposed to solve, whether there were evolution of electricity in muscular con-
traction,

Having got rid of this part of the question, the next which presents itself is the
consideration of the phenomena which we observe in the proper current (for which
we employ whole frogs), and which consist in signs of increased intensity on first
touching the lumbar plexuses of the frogs with potassa, while, on the contrary, an
acid s0lution' causes the needle to fall instantaneously. To arrive at a knowledge of
these facts I have repeated and varied my former experiments, and the explanation
of the facts is as follows :â€”

Whatever be the form of the elements used for constructing the muscular pile,
that is to say, whether it be made of-entire frogs, of halves of thighs, or, as described
(fig. 13.), if the surface of the muscular elements be bathed with an acid or alkaline
s0lution, it constantly happens, whether there be contractions or not, that the de-
