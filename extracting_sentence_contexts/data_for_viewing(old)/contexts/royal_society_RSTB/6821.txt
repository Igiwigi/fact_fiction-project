several immunizing effects in the mentioned combinations of viruses may be probable,
reaching at least such a strength that a complete immunity against the white mosaic
has come into being.”

It is not easy to follow Thung’s line of thought, but it seems to be as follows: Each
virus on entering a plant stimulates the cells to produce an “averting principle”
against other viruses; a strong virus, i.e. one which in a simultaneous mixed infection
dominates the other, produces more of such substances. It is further supposed that
such substances can penetrate into non-infected cells of a plant and then set up a
protection against a second invading virus.

Infection or immunity therefore becomes a matter of the ultimate equilibrium
between blocking elements and the “strength”’ of virus. The fact that such a theory

demands the existence of neutralizing substances in the sap, for which there is no
evidence, is acknowledged by Thung. This objection, as well as the localization of one
or other virus in definite areas in mixed infections militates against the possibility of
humoral immunity in plants.

One cannot altogether evade the thought that in some cases discussed by Thung the
first two invading viruses have, so to speak, exhausted the clinical capacity for morbid
reaction of the plant, and that a further virus, which acting alone would call forth a
