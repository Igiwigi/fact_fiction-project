structure of ripple phases in hydrated conditions at the nanometre scale [58]. The observation of


a phase transition process is characterized by a melting point temperature of the ripple phase to
fluid phase, nucleation point and growth directionality for the formation of the ripple phase.
HS-AFM coupled to a temperature-controlled system reported directly ripple to fluid phase
transitions (reversibly) in real time and at high resolution [59]. When the fluid bilayer was cooling
down, ripples appeared as concentric rings progressing from the edge region of the lipid patch
towards the centre upon cooling. This ring-pattern formation was maybe a consequence of a
heterogeneous thermalization along the nanometric patch and cooling progressed from the edges
that exposed the largest surface to the cooling bulk. It could also be a consequence that the
bending and edge formation of the lipids at the patch border represented favourable nucleation
spots for ripple phase reformation, or both. In fact, throughout cycles of heating/cooling, the
ripple phase pattern changed every time, suggesting that the thermal history of the bilayer
was erased in the fluid phase. Based on the vanâ€™t Hoff expression, the representation of area
fraction of each phase as a function of the temperature provides estimations about the transition

enthalpy and the cooperativity of the lipid molecules during the process. The cooperativity of 8
