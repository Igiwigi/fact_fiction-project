Instead, we estimated a value of M for each cancer type only three mutational steps, an estimate driven by the very
using equation (3.1), an approach that uses all of the available slow rate of stem-cell division and it is consistent for smokers
data. In addition, to fit the equation we needed to assume that and non-smokers, even though smokers presumably experience
the same somatic mutation rate underpins each mutational hit a higher somatic mutation rate that was not taken into account
and assign it some value. In fact, a range of values was assigned (see below). A similar effect is apparent in comparing Lynch
by establishing the values of u that maintained 7 >M >3 syndrome colorectal cancer with the non-familial form (M = 7
across all of the cancers. The lower limit on M was based on for both), even though Lynch syndrome causes a higher somatic
Nunney’s [9,20] proposal that M > 3 (except for retinoblastoma mutation rate. (iv) The rate of somatic mutation (1) consistent
which has M = 2), noting that M = 3 was likely to be adequate with 7 > M >3 is quite high at approximately 8 x 10° per
for small tissues with minimal post-growth division, while daughter cell.
