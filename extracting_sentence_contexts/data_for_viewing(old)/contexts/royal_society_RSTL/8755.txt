on the conductivity and specific inductive capacity, as ordinarily determined, of the
material, but also on the constants counecting polarization with electric force. Indeed if
the above view really represent the facts, the conductivity of a dielectric determined
from the steady flow of electricity through it measured by the galvanometer will differ
from that determined by the rate of loss of charge of the condenser when insulated.

2. A Florence flask nearly 4 inches in diameter was carefully cleansed, filled with
strong sulphuric acid, and immersed in water to the shoulder. Platinum wires were
dipped in the two fluids, and were also connected with the two principal electrodes of
the quadrant electrometer. The jar was slightly charged and insulated, and the poten-
tials read off from time to time. It was found (1) that even after twenty-four hours the
percentage of loss per hour continued to decrease, (2) that the potential could not be
expressed as a function of the time by two exponential terms. But the latter fact was
more clearly shown by the rate of development of the residual charge after different
periods of discharge, which put it beyond doubt that if the potential is properly expressed
by a series of exponential terms at all, several such terms will be required.

The following roughly illustrates how such terms could arise. Glass may be regarded
as a mixture of a variety of different silicates ; each of these may behave differently
under electric force, some rapidly approaching the limiting polarity corresponding
to the force, others more slowly. If these polarities be as8umed to be # in number,
they and E may be connected with the time by +1 linear differential equations. Hence

uring insulation E would be expressed in the form ZZ A, **. Suppose now a condenser
be charged positively for a long time, the polarization of all the substances will be fully
