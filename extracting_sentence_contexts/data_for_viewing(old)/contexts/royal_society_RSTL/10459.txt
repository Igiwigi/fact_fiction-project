790 LORD RAYLEIGH ON THE CLARK OELL AS

in general the anhydrous salt mus tend either to leave or to enter the 8olution,
the former alternative is excluded by the observed behaviour on first contact. :

$ 50. In view of the above facts we can hardly doubt that a Clark cell, heated
nearly to the temperature of boiling water and then cooled, would be likely to
become supersaturated ; but I thought it would be satisfactory actually to try the
experiment. A normal cell of my own preparation and containing an excess of
undissolved salt, was maintained for several hours at an elevated temperabare, and
tested after cooling. A temperature of 38* C, did not permanently alter the cell ;
neither did a temperature of 49?, nor one of 60%. But after an exposure to about,
80* a permanent change set in. Immediately after cooling the value in terms of the
standards was 9914, but after one day's standing it settled to 9943, close to which
value it has since remained. Tt appears from the above that the cell probably
requires to be heated sufficiently to decompose the normal hydrate, and not merely
to bring all the immersed salt into solution. In the latter case there may well be
8olid particles within reach, which re-determine normal crystallisation on cooling.
