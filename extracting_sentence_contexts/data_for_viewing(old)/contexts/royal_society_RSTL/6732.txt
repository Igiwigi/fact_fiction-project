experiment; that is to say, it had been brought to sch a condition by previons crop-
ping, that, in the ordinary course of practice, it would be deemed necessary to supply
manure to it, before growing another corn-crop. It may be further remarked that in
the case of the wheat there is as yet little, but in that of the barley more obvious
indication of progressive decline in the annual yield.

The meadow-land yielded nearly 40 1bs. of Nitrogen per acre, per annum, or aboye
one-half more than the exclusively Graminaceous crops, wheat and barley. The hetero-
geneous produce, meadow-hay, contained, however, a good deal of Trifolium, and other
Leguminous plants, intermixed with the Grasses. 'To this fact is to be attributed, at:
least in great part, its comparatively high amount of Nitrogen. It should be observed,
too, that the average is as yet taken over only four years.

The Leguminous crop (beans) has given, over a period of twelve years, an average of
nearly 48 Ibs. of Nitrogen per acre, per annum. The yield of Nitrogen in this Legumi-
nous crop was, therefore, nearly twice as great as in the Graminaceous corn-crops. The
bean and allied crops are, however, very subject to disease, especially when grown too
frequently on the same land. It is, at least in part, owing to this circumstance, that
the average annual yield oyer the twelve years was 80 much less than would be. the
yield of the crop when grown in suitable alternation with others in a season of average
adaptation for its healthy development. In fact, s0 great was the deterioration in the
character and amount of produce in the experiments in question, due to the continuous
