most commonly used. The O(¢) regularization error associated with boundary collocation is
inherited by the resistance problem for finding the traction associated with a given rigid body
motion, and the swimming problem for finding the traction and translation/rotation resulting
from a given boundary deformation and force/moment balance. It is distinct from the errors


associated with discretization of the traction and numerical quadrature which we will consider
shortly.

Regularization enables a particularly convenient discretization of the single layer boundary
integral equation; this simplicity however comes at a cost. The Nystrém method (3.2) corresponds
to using identical discretizations for the traction f<(y) and Sjx(x,y) when considered as functions
of position y € B (the latter for fixed x), despite the fact that the stokeslet kernel varies much
more rapidly than the traction, as shown in figure 1, the variability becoming more rapid as ¢ is
reduced (figure 2). The number of degrees of freedom of the system 3N and hence the 3N x 3N
matrix size is tied to the discretization for the traction, and so reducing the regularization error
via reducing ¢ entails rapid growth in memory and computational requirements associated with
system assembly and solution. Cortez et al. [24] initially suggested a quadrature error O(i?/e3)
where hi is the discretization length; more recently [42] this estimate has been improved to
O(h? /e) + O(Pe~V/Ph-?) for any integer P > 3.

As described in equations (2.10), (2.11), boundary element methods separate out the traction
and quadrature discretization by expanding the traction in terms of basis functions, leaving the
stokeslet integrals to be evaluated by the most appropriate means (e.g. adaptive quadrature)
without affecting the number of degrees of freedom of the system. Alongside being the standard
