I am therefore inclined to think, and other considerations confirm me in that
opinion, that the absorbing medium acts something like a file in thinning off the absorbed portions of the ray, and
requires that the ray should penetrate into its substance before it can exercise any absorbing action upon it. MR. POWER ON THE ABSORPTION OF THE SOLAR RAYS, ETC. 29

of the incident beam, to be all in the same phase of vibra-
tion, and after a certain time to have undulated into the
position PQ, having been previously refracted by the
surface AB, The time from P through A to P, will be
