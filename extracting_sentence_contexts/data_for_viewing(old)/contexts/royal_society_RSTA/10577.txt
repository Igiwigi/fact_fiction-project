In conclusion I have to express my indebtedness to Professor G. H. Darwin and
Professor A. E H. Love for advice and assistance which I have received from them.

[Nore.—Added February 20th, 1903. While the above paper was in the press,
Professor W. J. Sotias read a paper before the Geological Society in which the
Figure of the Earth was discussed from a geological standpoint. Professor Sotias
had arrived, from an examination of the geological features of the earth, at a
conclusion very similar to that to which I had been led from theoretical
considerations : he had detected an axis of symmetry, other than the axis of rotation,
in the earth’s figure, and expressed the opinion that ‘the pear-shaped form, now that
it was pointed out, became obvious to mere inspection: it was a geographical fact,
and not a speculation.”

The axis of Professor Sonias’ pear does not, however, coincide with that which I
tentatively put forward in the above paper, and the object of this note is to accept
the alteration suggested by his paper. The conclusion reached in his paper is that
the axis of symmetry of the pear-shaped figure passes through a point of latitude
and longitude about 6° N. by 30° E. Thus Africa—the continent whose mean height
above sea-level is greatest—must be taken to be the centre of the “Land
Hemisphere ” in fig. 1 of my paper, while the protuberance which formed the stalk
of the pear is submerged in the Pacific Ocean, which now forms the “ Water
Hemisphere.” Almost the only remaining evidence of the existence of this
protuberance is the fact that the axis of the pear coincides with the earth’s greatest
