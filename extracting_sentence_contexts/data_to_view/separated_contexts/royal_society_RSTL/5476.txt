M. BxcqueRtL attributed this increase of temperature in muscles during contraction to
the greater activity of sanguineous circulation which apparently takes place in a muscle
in that state. In support of this interpretation, M. BEcqQUEREL 8howed, that, by com-
pressing one of the large arteries distributed in a muscle under experiment, an immediate
decrease of temperature takes place in that muscle. M. BERNARD discovered an increase
of heat in one of the ears of a rabbit or dog after having cut the cervical ganglion con-
nected with the nervous filament of that ear: this remarkable fact is also associated in
80me unknown manner, depending on the peculiar action of the ganglionic system, with
a more rapid capillary circulation of blood in the ear in which the temperature is highest. It remained therefore still to be proved by experiment whether an increase of tempera-
ture is produced by the act of contraction in a muscle which is separated from the body,
and as far as possible is deyoid of blood, in which consequently sanguineous circulation
is extinct. The experiment was easily made and the result not doubtful.
