The star, however, began now gradually to fade, and after
the remaining 1”, during which I observed it with all pos-
sible attention, it vanished in an instant. This observation
agrees perfectly with the above computations. Although it
be proved that the inferior dense part of the lunar atmo-
sphere reflects a stronger light than that which the dark he-
misphere receives from an almost fully illuminated disk of our
earth; and although, considering the inferiority of gravitation
on the surface of the moon, there be no doubt that this dense
part, together with the superior gradually more rarified regions
of its atmosphere, must extend far above its highest mountains;
it is yet a fact that the breadth of this observed twilight, to where
it loses itself in our reflected terrestrial light, does not measure
more than 2* 34/: it is, therefore, highly probable that its
greatest extent, in the most favourable phases near our new
moon, can never exceed the double of the above-arc, or z* 8';
and hence we can only infer a perpendicular height of an at-
mosphere, capable of inflecting the solar rays, which at most
measures 5376 feet : nor is it very likely that, unless accidental,
and hitherto unknown circumstances should occasionally con-
densedifferent parts of this atmosphere, these upperstratashould
materially affect the distinctness of a star seen through it.

But admitting the height of the atmosphere, which may affect
the brightness of a:fixed $tar, not to be less than 3376 feet, this
will amount to an arc of only 0,94”, or not quite one second ;
and as the moon describes an arc of 1 in 2” of time, it follows
that in general the fading of a star, which approaches to an
occultation, cannot last quite 2” in time; that if the appulse be
at a part of a limb of the moon where a ridge of mountains
interferes, the gradual obscuration will last a still shorter time ;
and that it may, under some circumstances of this nature, be
even instantaneous. Supplement to the foregoing Observations on the Atmosphere of
the Moon. The following observation of an occultation of Jupiter by
the moon, when near its full, occurred to me by mere acci-
dent, on the 7th of April, 1792 ; and I was the more gratified
by it, as.I had long wished for an opportunity to observe 8uch
a. phenomenon, and had no expectation of seeing it at this
time, no mention being made of it in the Ephemerides.
