acquired in the large Amphibia with which this paper deals, and in the Urodeles and
Ecaudata, for these latter types have a very different though uncertain ancestry.

These structures, or at least such of them as are known in that form, have had
an independent origin in the Lower Permian animal Diplocaulus, belonging to the
Lepospondyli, which at that early period had acquired a structure which is in many
ways extremely similar to that of such an Upper Triassic Stereospondyl as
Plagiosternum, a structure which amongst the large Amphibia does not occur until
that period.

This case of the parallel evolution of diverse branches of the same class is perhaps
the most striking that paleontology has yet revealed to us, not only from the
accuracy of the parallel, but from the fact that the structures whose independent
origin has been traced are of such importance that since the time of Cuvier they
have been recognised as diagnostic characters of the class Batrachia.

It is my intention in subsequent papers to deal with the earlier history of the
Rachitomi-Stereospondyli stock and to discuss the structure and, as far as material
allows, the evolutionary history of the Lepospondyli and Phyllospondyli, and the
embryonic history of the skull in living Amphibia, when I shall return to the con-
sideration of this great instance of parallelism.

Some parallels to these changes can be found amongst reptiles, although the series
as a whole is restricted to the Amphibia.
