WILSON ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENITLEA,

embryological history, the csophagus is apparently a true stomodzum, comparable
to that of the higher Metazoa, The general occurrence of this structure—which,
80 far as the evidence at command shows, is homologous throughout all the groups
in which it is found—is a very striking fact which probably has an important
phylogenetic significance. Tts universal occurrence among the Anthozoa and complete
absence from the Hydrozoa is a strong argument in favour of the more primitive
nature of the latter group. From the fact that the Anthozoa are the most primitive
group in which the stomodzenum appears, it might be concluded that this group
represents the stock from which the higher Metazoa have descended. Tt seems,
however, much more probable that the line of descent has been through some primitive
Turbellarian form which, in common with the polyps, derived the stomodzum from a
still earlier group. What this origin of the stomodzum was is still an unsolved
problem.
