In trying to form a theory to explain new facts, it is always advisable to see if any
& theory which has been devised to explain somewhat similar facts will apply to this case
D also. , With this consideration 1 cannot help thinking that the recent views which
Z have been put forward to explain the changes going on in gland cells in a condition of
rest and activity may help in the conception of the changes going on in the cardiac
8 muscle cells under the influence of such a nerve as the vagus. In all secretory glands it
appears to be the fact that the formation of the ultimate products of secretion is a
gradual process, three stages of which can be recognised, viz. : the growth of the proto-
plasm, the formation of zymogen from the protoplasm, and the formation of the ultimate
products from the zymogen ; and according to LANGLEY* these three processes not only
go on at the same time, but als» there may be, under different cireumstances, a dif-
ference in the relative rates ab which they proceed. Tf, then, we imagine in the cardiac muscle an initial or ground substance, or, in corre-
spondence with the gland cell, a muscle protoplasm and a final or explosive 8ubstance
which is not self-explosible, but requires a stimulus to fire it off, then we may conceive
