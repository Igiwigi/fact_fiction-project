AND DEVELOPMENT OF APTERYX. 99

The ischium and pubis are not continuous, as in Miss Jonnsonâ€™s figures, but are
separated by a layer of indifferent tissue extending downwards from the acetabulum,

Stage E (Plate 18, fig. 275).

The more advanced condition of the pre- than of the post-ilium is very obvious.
The post-ilium (Pt.J/m.) has attained its adult proportions, ze, is of about the same
length as the ischium and pubis; it is also curved downwards, as in the adult, and has
altogether a finished appearance. The pre-ilium (Pr.J/m.), on the other hand, is
very thin, ends in an irregular border, and falls far short of its ultimate dimensions.
These facts certainly lend support to the view that it is the post-ilium of Birds which
answers to the ilium of Reptiles, and that the pre-ilium is a secondary structure.

The distinctness of the pubis and ischium is well seen both in a dissection and in
sections ; there is a well-defined tract of fibrous tissue passing vertically downwards
from the acetabulum, and separating their proximal ends from one another.

Stage F (Plate 18, fig. 276).

The most marked change is the forward extension of the pre-ilium (P7.JIm.), which
has attained its ultimate length, although its dorsal region is still imperfect. The
pubis and ischium are now distinctly inclined backwards.
