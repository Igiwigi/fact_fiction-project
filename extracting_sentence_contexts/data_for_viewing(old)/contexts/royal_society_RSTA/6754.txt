the yielded regions. During flexure in the yield range, Liiders lines will have penetrated from
the outer surface of the beam to the boundary between the elastic and yielded material.
When the beam is in equilibrium under the applied loads it may be supposed from the
discussion of the nature of Liiders lines in ยง3 that the tips of the Liiders lines on this boundary
will be causing a stress concentration which is just equal to the ratio of the upper to the lower
Field stress. On the application of an increment of load this stress concentration will increase
By a small amount, causing a tendency for the Liiders lines to penetrate further into the
Gastic core of the beam until equilibrium is again attained. If all the Liiders lines were of
@ual size, it might be supposed that there was an equal probability of each one completing
i further penetration in any given interval of time, and in this case the relation between
the overall change of curvature and time would be of exponential form. In actual fact the
Geep observations cannot be fitted exactly by curves of exponential form, and the dis-
@epancy may be ascribed to the fact that the Liiders lines vary widely in size.
