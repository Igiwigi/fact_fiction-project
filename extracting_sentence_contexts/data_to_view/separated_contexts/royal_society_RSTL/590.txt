These facts appear to prove, that the vessels of plants are not
equally well calculated to carry their contents in opposite di-
rections ; and, I think, afford some grounds to suspect that the
vessels of the bark, like those which constitute the venous
system of animals, (to which they are in many respects analo-
gous,) may be provided with valves, whose extreme minuteness
has concealed them from observation. The experiments, and still more, the Plates, of HaLts, have

induced naturalists to draw conclusions in direct opposition to
the preceding. But the Plates of that great naturalist are not
always taken correctly from nature ;* and Plates, under such
circumstances, however fair and candid the intentions of an
author may be, will too often be found somewhat better calcu-
lated to support his own hypothesis, than to elucidate the facts
he intends to state. The preceding peculiarities in the growth of inverted cuttings,
appear to have escaped the observation of Du HAamEL; and, as
very few instances of error, or want of accurate observation, will
ever be found in the works of that excellent naturalist, I must
request permission to send you some of the subjects of my ex-
periments, as vouchers for my own accuracy. Of the inverted cuttings employed by Du Honeens a small
portion only appears to have remained above the ground ; and,
under such circumstances, the different forms of those growing
in their natural, or inverted, position would be scarcely ob-
servable.
