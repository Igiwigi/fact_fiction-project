The gnathobases of the second to fifth trunk
limbs have swung up so that their posterior
corners nearly reach the edge of the second
endite, fig. 12. In fact, in a median view of
the limbs it is difficult to tell at first sight where
the gnathobase ends and where the second
endite begins. This point, however, is clearly
marked by the claw-bearing ridge which car-
ries the same two spines, a very long posterior
one with a curved claw in front of it. The
sete of the distal endites thus form an almost
unbroken series with those of the gnathobase.
