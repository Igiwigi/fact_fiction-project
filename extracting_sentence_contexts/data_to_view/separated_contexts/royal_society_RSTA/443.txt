Inertia generates well-localized resonant peaks in the three modes (I, II, II). Inertialess conditions
generate a broader power peak only in mode III (large viscosity) since dissipative modes persist
with higher frequencies. These facts follow from the fact that the power is proportional to the
imaginary part of the transfer function P() = Im[Fp(@)]|/2 (see equation (4.9)) and according
to the asymptotic results of appendix C, only under finite inertia Im[Fp(@)] converges at large
frequency to its static value. Hence, except for mode III, inertialess conditions do not generate
power pulses.
