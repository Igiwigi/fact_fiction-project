Recent work led to the identification of a novel Nodal

these mutants, and that it involves a TGF-B-related ligand ipotency factors, and to the characterization of its implication
other than zygotic Nodal. This interpretation is supported in the regulatory shift taking place at the Nodal locus. HBE is
by the fact that Nodal~'~ epiblast cells prematurely differen- the only active Nodal enhancer in ESCs, while it is ASE that is
tiate along the neural pathway, just as EpiSCs do when the most active one in EpiSCs [23,92]. Both enhancers are

relies on pSmad2/3 interacting with distinct transcription fac-
