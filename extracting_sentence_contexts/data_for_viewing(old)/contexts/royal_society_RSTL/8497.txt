through iodide of potassium have, it is true, been subjected to a similar treatment in
this respect; and if the same quantity of oxygen were absorbed by the alkaline solution
in the two cases, the value of the difference between the yolumes of the gases, which is

the numerator of the fraction —5— in the preceding calculation, would not be affected

by this circumstance. But this cannot on the average be the case; for the relative
volume of oxygen present in the latter gas being considerably greater than that present
in the former, a larger quantity of it will be absorbed by the solution. Now we
have (as has been explained) in the contraction which the unabsorbed gas undergoes on
detonation with oxygen an independent measure of the total oxygen formed in the
induction-tube; and, in fact, if we compare the average values thus actually obtained
for the total oxygen in the gas, it will be found that the sum of the © titre” and the
oxygen absorbed by pyrogallate of potash is sensibly less than the contraction. This,
however, only appears when we consider the mean result, as there are many causes of
error which affect the individual experiments. 'The comparison of these values in the case
of fourteen experiments is given below. In column 1. is given the sum of the oxygen
absorbed by pyrogallate of potash and the *© titre” of the gas; in column II. the con-
traction which the same gas underwent when detonated with oxygen—the results of the
experiments being calculated on equal volumes of gas in the two experiments respectively.
