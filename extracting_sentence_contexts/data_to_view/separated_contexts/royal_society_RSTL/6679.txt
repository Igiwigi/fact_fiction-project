There would appear to be, then,
2 compensating quality for the 8mall actual amount of Nitrogen as ammonia in propor-
Zion to carbon as carbonic acid in the atmosphere, in the greater absorbability or s8olu-
Sility of the compounds in which Nitrogen exists than of the carbonic acid in which
Me carbon is presented. How far, however, the compensating quality here suggested
Hay really influence the proportion of the Nitrogen to the carbon available from the
ZStmosphere, in the combined form, under the actual conditions involved in vegetation, is
i=] question the numerous and intricate bearings of which we do not profess here to
Enter uPon. Z Before passing from this question of the direct absorption of Nitrogen in the com-
Sined form from the atmosphere by plants themselves, one or two further observations
y yet be made which are suggested by the actual facts of agricultural production. t is undoubtedly the case that the Graminaceous crops depend very materially upon
combined Nitrogen within the 80, to determine the amount of their produce. They
*em, however, to be comparatively independent of carbonic acid yielded by manure
within the soil.
