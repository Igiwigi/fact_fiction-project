Buenion has suggested (1912, p. 1094) that the
differentiation of the soldier caste is due to some fundamental cause analogous to that
which determines sex (special mode of fertilisation or special chromosomes). This
view, I believe, is nearer the probable truth than that of Grasst and Sanpras, As
already mentioned, BuGyion has shown that in species of Termes and Hutermes
differentiation into the soldier caste takes place during embryonic life. Furthermore,
Feyraup (1912, p. 563) observes that in the first stage larvee of Levcotermes luci-
Sugus—* Tl est possible que, dés cette période de Vexistence des larvee, il y ait déja
lieu de distinguer deux catégories d’individus au point de vue du développement des
organes génitaux, ceux qui doivent devenir sexués les ayant plus développés.” It is
probable, therefore, that too much emphasis has hitherto been laid on the fact that,
in the majority of Termites so far studied, the young larvee are hatched apparently
all alike. This fact has given rise to the belief that caste differentiation necessarily
takes place during post-embryonic life, when its presence first becomes obvious. One of the outstanding difficulties of the Darwinian theory concerns this problem
of polymorphism—in other words, the question as to how the characters of the
sterile soldier and worker secure representation in the germ cells of the species.
