gain the deep cellular layer of the integument, in which they are principally distribute

I distinetly saw a fibre (marked e) leaving the 8ubstance of the lateral cord and passin
beneath the muscular bundle lying outside it. Dr. SCHNEIDER 8eems inclined to thin
that some large nerve-fibres may pass posteriorly in the substance of the dorsal an
ventral median lines, though he has never absolutely traced nerve-fibres passing from th
central ring into these bodies. He rests his opinion upon the fact that in fine transverg
Sections which he has made of the median lines, he has found them perforated length
wise by cavities having an elliptical or oval cross section; which tubes or cavities, bv
sates, are invariably filled with a transparent, homogeneous s8ubstance of a reddish 9
yellowish tint. He says that from 8ix to eight 8uch bodies can be detected in thi
ventral median line of A. megalocephala, but only from four to six in the dorsal. Thea
are considered to be transverse sections of nerve-fibres; but the fact that they have *
distinctly larger diameter than the principal nerve-fibres issuing from the ganglion-celk
seems to me s8trongly opposed to this view. I have myself been unable to recogniz
such structures in the median lines, 80 must refer for further details concerning them to
Dr. ScaxzDER's important memoir.

The nervous system of Ozyuris curvula has also been carefully examined by SCHNEIDED
and in this animal he has found the cesophageal band most distinct, as well as the ant&
rior fibres, though very few ganglion-cells could be detected. He has with difficultyÂ»
moreover, detected the most important parts of this nervous system in Strongyluf

bf These large cells have rather a remarkable appearance from their isolated pozition, but till the agpect of
their nucleus and cell-contents corresponds most closely with that of other ganglion-cells.
