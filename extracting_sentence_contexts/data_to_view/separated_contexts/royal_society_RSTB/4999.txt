I am therefore not absolutely sure that they are natural channels, though their definite
outlines, which present an appearance very unlike the diffuseness of an undoubted
extravasation, incline me to believe that they are, and that the condition shown in
fig. 7 is either a variant or is due to the injection not being sufficiently prolonged. When |
present, they follow roughly the coracoid branch of the hypobranchial artery, and

consist of very irregular spaces of limited capacity flattened between the claviculo-
pelvic muscles and the pericardium, and so far as I have been able to ascertain, form the
only open and direct connection between the sub-thyroid sinus and the great lymph
reservoirs situated at the base of the skull through which the chief constituents of the
lymphatic system as a whole communicate with the jugular vein. But from the back-
ward trend of these communicating channels it seems unlikely that the lymph in the
ventral system passes along them to any extent towards the pectoral sinus ; it seems,

‘in fact, more probable that the flow would be in the opposite direction (as in other
tributaries of the ventral system) from the aida around the pectoro-pelvic articulation
towards the sub-thyroid sinus. Tn any case there is, I think, no question that the flow of lymph in the ventral system
