Ficure 5. Compound colonies attached to floating particles and in process of formation, x 1000. These facts were established with the help of the micro-chambers described on p. 321,
which also made it possible to study the origin of the stalks. After a swarmer has settled
on the cover-slip, it gives rise to an irregular cluster of a few cells, which multiply to form
colonies (figures 5, 6). By mutual pressure of the cells the colonies :
become more regular.
