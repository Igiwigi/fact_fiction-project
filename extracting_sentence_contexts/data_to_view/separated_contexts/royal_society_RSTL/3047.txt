It
must, however, be remarked, in answer to this supposition, that the one spark between
d and e would, by its influence, tend to produce simultaneous discharges at n and o,
and certainly did 80, when no preponderance was given to one wire over the other,
as to the previous inductive effect (1414.). 1418. The fact, however, is, that disruptive discharge is favourable to itself, It is
at the outset a case of tottering equilibrium : and if time be an element in discharge,
in however minute a proportion (1436.), then the commencement of the act at any
point favours its continuance and increase there, and portions of power will be dis-
charged by a course which they would not otherwise have taken.

1419. The mere heating and expansion of the air itself by the first portion of elec-
tricity which passes, must have a great influence in producing this result. 1420.
