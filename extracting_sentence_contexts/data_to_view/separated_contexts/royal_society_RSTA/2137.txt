2” being the unit vector having at every point the direction of the curve of the congruence
passing through the point, these equations may be written
(2.63) 1%

and hence, by differentiation with respect to the arc of the curve of the congruence,

(2.64) (Ses Lee
or in covariant form,
(2.65) K, = Aydt,

where 2,, is the covariant derivative of 4,. Thus, since the vanishing of all the
components of x, is the characteristic of a geodesic, we have the result :

THeorEM II] :—In order that the curves of a congruence may be geodesics, it is necessary
and sufficient that

where 2° is the unit vector everywhere co-directional with the congruence. It is important to note that from the mere fact that 4” is a unit vector we have

and therefore
