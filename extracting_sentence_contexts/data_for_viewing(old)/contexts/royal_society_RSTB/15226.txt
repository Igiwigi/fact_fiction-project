been shown to apply different mechanisms of intraoral food
processing [49,73,74,115,116,163]. While some exceptional
species like Hynobius dunni (see electronic supplementary
material, table S1) seem to swallow their prey unprocessed
as do most frogs [164,165], the observations presented here
suggest that intraoral food processing is a basal caudate
trait (table 1 and electronic supplementary material, table S1).
Below we provide an overview of how intraoral food proces-
sing may be distributed across salamander species and their
developmental morphotypes.
