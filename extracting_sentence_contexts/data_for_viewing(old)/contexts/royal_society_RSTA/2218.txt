before.

On 14 July 1909, he married S. Janaki and was compelled to seek employment. He obtained
meetings with V. Ramaswami Aiyar, the founder of the Indian Mathematical Society, and
P. V. Seshu Aiyar, Ramanujan’s teacher at the Government College in Kumbakonam. They
directed him to a wealthier mathematician, R. Ramachandra Rao, who provided Ramanujan with
a monthly stipend so that he could continue ‘doing his sums,’ in the words of Janaki many years
later.

Ramanujan did not feel comfortable with receiving money without ‘working’, and
consequently he applied for a position as a clerk in the Madras Port Trust office. One cannot
overestimate the importance of Ramanujan’s decision to submit such an application, the foresight
of the Madras Port Trust to offer him a position, and the fact that the chief accountant at the
office was S. Narayana Aiyer, who was one of the best mathematicians in India at that time.
Janaki later reported that her husband would work in the office during the day, and that in
the evening he and Narayana Aiyar would work on mathematics until the wee hours of the
morning.

In another epic decision in the history of mathematics, Narayana Aiyar suggested that
Ramanujan write to English mathematicians about his work. Letters to two mathematicians at
Cambridge evidently did not produce a reply [4]. A letter to M. J. M. Hill at the University of
London was answered, but, clearly, he did not appreciate Ramanujan’s mathematics [5, pp. 17—
19]. Next, on 15 January 1913, Ramanujan wrote to the famous Cambridge mathematician
G. H. Hardy. We can be eternally grateful for both the decision of Narayana Aiyar and Ramanujan
to write to Hardy and the decision of Hardy to take this letter seriously, to recognize the creativity
