This was all very well so long as the same instrument was used for all observations. J. Vixcent, in his account of ‘‘ Nouvelles Recherches sur la Température Climato-
logique,” considers this fact a fatal objection to Hmserpen’s work (Joc. cit.), and
suggests that a possible way of overcoming the difficulty would be for all investi-
gators adopting the rate of cooling method to have their thermometers made to
the same pattern by the same maker. As already mentioned, our experience
does not support this contention, for kata-thermometers made to the same pattern
differ so much in their water equivalents that comparison of results obtained with
different instruments is out of the question unless the same have been properly
standardised. It is essential, therefore, for the sake of scientific precision, to express the rate of
cooling in heat units per second.
