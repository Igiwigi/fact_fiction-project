— @ preserves H and F;
— &*(Q)=2.

(ii) There exists a one-parameter family of local diffeomorphisms (x,y) (real-analytic in x, y and
A) leaving fixed the origin in R?(x,y) at %=0 and such that, for each 2 €R close enough


to 0,

— W preserves H(x,y,);
— VW3@,) =o.

Proof. The fact that (i) implies (ii) is almost obvious. Indeed, as 2 and @ are of quite special
form, 6*(@2) = Q and F=A is preserved, then in local coordinates x,y,4,¢g, the diffeomorphism
takes the following form:

Y=X(x,y,d),
y=HOy,A),
A=d

and G=9+ R(x, y,A).

If we consider the first two functions as a family of diffeomorphisms y(x,y), then we will
immediately see that (ii) holds. As ® preserves H and F, it leaves invariant the set of such points
(x,y, 4,9) that dH(x, y,4,~) and dF(x,y, 4, g) are proportional. But for A = 0, this set coincides with
