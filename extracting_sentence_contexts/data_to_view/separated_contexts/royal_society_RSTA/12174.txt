970 PROFESSOR J. PRESTWICH ON THE EVIDENCES OF A SUBMERGENCE

Hippopotamus have been found on the north-west side of the Lasethe Mountains,
but their age is doubtful and more particulars are wanting. These facts prove how prolonged earth movements have been in this area. They
show also that drift deposits of the same character as we have noticed in Greece and
Malta are clearly traceable thus far eastward. Turkey.—What little is known of the superficial deposits of Turkey confirms the
impression that the later geological changes we have described, affected that country
equally with Greece.
