OF THE FOSSIL PLANTS OF THE COAL-MEASURKES. 101

distinct genus, has strongly marked features of affinity in the structure of its stem
to the Sphenophylloid type. Hence all these plants may be recognised as constituting
one of the several groups which collectively form the great family of the Calamarie,
and of which family the modern genus Equisetwm, instead of being the central type,
is but a poor, feeble, and degraded member.

Culamites.

My attention has long been drawn to the fact that, whilst sandstone casts of
considerable dimensions, moulded in the interiors of the fistular medulle of
Calamitean stems are notoriously common, similar casts of the interiors of the smaller
branches are extremely rare. Fig. 20, which represents (natural size) the interior
cast of a single internode of such a branch is the smallest one preserving the
common features of cylindrical form, longitudinal ridges and furrows, and, at. the
two ends, the two nodal transverse constrictions, that I have met with during
fifty years of research. I have thought it desirable to demonstrate the cause of
this state of things. The example here figured is â€˜5 of an inch in diameter.
Comparing a medulla of this size with those of other decorticated specimens in my
cabinets, in which the exogenous woody zone is preserved, I have no doubt that fig. 20
belonged to a branch or stem that was at least an inch in diameter, independently of
its thick cortical zone. Seeing that I possess sections of decorticated Calamitean
