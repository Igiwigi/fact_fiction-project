Apart from all theory, it is certain that the image of a point or line of homo-
geneous light seen with a small aperture is diffused. As the aperture is gradually
widened the extent of diffusion decreases continuously, and at last hecomes insen-
8ible. The perfect continuity, however, of the phenomenon shows that the true and
complete explanation, whatever it may be, of the narrow image seen with a broad
aperture, ought also to explain the diffused image seen with a narrow aperture. The
undulatory theory explains perfectly both the one and the other, and even predicts
the distribution of the illumination in the image seen with an aperture of given form,
which is what no other theory has ever attempted.

As an instance of the effect of diffusion in an image, may be mentioned the ob-
served fact that the definition of a telescope is impaired by contracting the aperture.
With a moderate aperture, however, the diffusion is 80 slight as not to prevent fine
objects, such as the fixed lines of the spectrum, from being well seen.

For the present, however, let us suppose the light entering the telescope to consist
of rays which are brought accurately to a focus, but which nevertheless interfere.
When the plate is inserted into the fAluid the front of a wave entering the object-
glass will no longer be unbroken, but will present as it were a fault, in consequence

of the retardation produced by the plate. Let R be this retardation measured by
