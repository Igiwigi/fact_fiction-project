Figure 2. Tumour-derived EVs influence the microenvironment to promote tumour progression. The tumour microenvironment is comprised of a variety of cell types,
which interact with each other via different signalling mechanisms. Tumour-derived EVs induce the activation of tissue-resident fibroblasts into myofibroblasts,
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which in turn modify the ECM favouring cancer cell growth and the recruitment of immune cells. In fact, EVs derived
from cancer cells can exert both anti-tumour and pro-tumour activities on different cells of the immune system, which as a consequence secrete their own
EVs altering the behaviour of cancer cells. Furthermore, tumour-derived EVs contribute to numerous steps required for the progression from a primary tumour
to the final stages of metastasis, such as stimulating epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), vascular
leakiness and pre-conditioning of the premetastatic niche for ‘foreign cell’ establishment.
