When, now, the small size of the individual calicoblasts is remembered, it will be
readily seen that adjacent proximal ends would give the appearance of a continuous
band. These bands, like the “ points” in the median plane, sometimes appear
brownish. The highest magnifying power never displays any structure in the case of
points or bands that appear dark, but only shows a general black amorphous sub-
stance, which I can only regard as the carbonized residue of the originally unchanged
organic parts of the calicoblasts. The ultimate appearance of these portions would
naturally vary according to the rapidity or slowness of subsequent changes. And
infiltration of water might entirely remove the residual products und introduce foreign
material ; very often small crystals of salt are present.

Not infrequently the hyphe of fungi and alge penetrating the skeleton spread
more especially in these lamellar bands, the mere fact that the growth-lamelle
are there apposed to their neighbours affording an easier ingress for the hyphe.
Decalcification proved, however, that the hyphe ramified anywhere and everywhere,
as well as in the lamellar planes. Further, decalcification brought out very clearly
the identity of the median dark bands or points with those of the fibrous lamedle.
Usually, as decalcification proceeded, small tears appeared where the dark points of
the median plane had been, and also in the iamellar bands; at the end of the process,
the same places showed occasionally undeterminable fragments, organic and inorganic,
ov were entirely empty.

Thinking the “axes” of the fascicles appeared sometimes virtually solid, I thought
of possible chitinous intermixture, and tested them alongside of spicules of
Alcyonarians and sclerobases, partly calcareous, partly horny. The results for the
