E The particular experiments which I have to relate, have
S that connection in view; as they will shew, that in a close
Â® vessel, either filled with air, or free from it, the product of
2 evaporation affects, at the same time, the hygrometer and the
= manometer; the former by moisture, the latter by pression. =] But I must here take this as a fact, in order not to interrupt
E the course of the theory, which, from hygrology, leads to hy-
2 grometry, by certain laws demonstrated in the fluid which is
E the cause of moisture. 2
