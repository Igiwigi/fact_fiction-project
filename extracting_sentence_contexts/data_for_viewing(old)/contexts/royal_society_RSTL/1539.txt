Society to furnish me with opportunities of increasing my
knowledge of these subjects. In the mean time, I shall offer
a few words upon two other topics in vision, which seem to
derive illustration from my experiments with Belladonna.

V. 1. Not only do the pupils move together, when both eyes
are in a healthy state, but the pupil of one eye affected with
gutta serena moves with the pupil of the other, as long as this

erroneously, attributed to an immediate sympathy between
the pupils. For when the pupil of one eye becomes dilated
from the application of Belladonna, the pupil of the other, 50
far from dilating, becomes smaller. It follows, therefore, that
the size of the pupil is dependant, not only on the impression
of light on the retina of its own eye, but on that also which is

two together, which for the most part takes place, is only an
accidental consequence of the fact which I have mentioned.

2. As the action of the external muscles of the eye has been
ſrequently resorted to, for an explanation of its capacity to
