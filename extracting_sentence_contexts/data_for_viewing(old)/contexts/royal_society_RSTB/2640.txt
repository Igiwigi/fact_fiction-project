There are, therefore, abundant cases in Mesozoic, Tertiary, and recent Madre-
poraria of marked bilateral symmetry of septa retained in the mature calyces. In
point of this feature, such types stand nearer a primitive “ Rugose” type, in which
pinnate insertion and bilateral symmetry of the septa were associated, than do
certain Paleozoic types, in which the symmetry of the septa is radial in the mature
calyx, and no pinnate insertion is observed.

In fact, if the feature of pinnate insertion were to be strictly adhered to as a great
classificatory principle, many genera, Paleozoic equally with Mesozoic genera, would
have to be split up in an utterly artificial fashion, certain species referred to the one
group, and closely-related species to the other. I therefore entirely disagree with the
main orders of Madreporaria erected by Epowarps and Harmr—M. rugosa, M. aporosa,
M. perforata.

The “ Rugose” Epitheca is present in M. aporosa in all simple forms, always as a
common base around complete colonies, and even in certain colonies around each
individual corallite.

The tabule of M. vugosa are not peculiar to that order; they are still frequent in
Mesozoic genera, classified in various families, and can be demonstrated in a large
