More generally, IIT predicts that, whatever the neural cor-
relate of consciousness (NCC) turns out to be—whether it is
global or local within the cortex, anterior or posterior, medial
or lateral, whether it includes primary areas or not, the
thalamus or not, whether it encompasses neurons in supra-
granular, infragranular layers of cortex or not—it should be
a local maximum of @, and thus of a maximum of intrinsic,
irreducible cause-effect power. IIT also predicts that the
NCC is not necessarily fixed, but may expand, shrink and
even move within a given brain depending on various con-
ditions. In fact, there may even be multiple NCCs in a
single brain, as shown by split-brain patients, in which case
there should be multiple local maxima of integrated infor-
mation. Finally, IIT makes precise predictions about the
physical elements that constitute the NCC and the time inter-
vals and levels of activity at which they operate [77,79]: they
should have a spatial scale that achieves the highest value of
®, as opposed to finer or coarser grains (say, either individual
neurons or local groups of neurons rather than neuronal com-
partments or brain areas); they should operate most
effectively (highest value of ®) at the time scale of conscious-
ness, as opposed to finer or coarser scales (say, hundred
milliseconds rather than a millisecond or ten seconds); and
