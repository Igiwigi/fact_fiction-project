functions formed as the sum of Lyapunov functions for local subsystems. The adequate
mathematical formalism here is a mix of stability theory (usually Lyapunov or input-output
methods) and graph theory (the properties of a system significantly depend on the spectrum of
the so-called Laplacian matrix of the graph of connections defined via its adjacency matrix). An
efficient tool joining the topological properties of a network with its dynamics has been proposed
by Pecora and Carroll in 1998, who introduced the master stability function [114].

A number of recent researches was devoted to output feedback synchronization of nonlinear
systems [115-117].

More recently, a lot of interest was attracted by pinning control where only a fraction of the
nodes are affected by control. Important contributions in pinning control were made by Chen
and co-workers [69-71,118]. In fact, feasibility question for the pinning control is an issue of
controllability of the network. Such a question may be generalized and one may ask when
the specified structure of the network is controllable. Such a question got a broader attention
after the paper [119]. Chen and co-workers [120] provide review of and further insight into the
controllability of the networks.

Recent studies led also to discovery of more complex synchronization-related phenomena
like cluster synchronization [121-123], chimaera states [124-127], polarization [128,129], motifs
[130-132], etc. Sch√©ll and his group have valuable contributions into development of most of
those new concepts. Some of them are surveyed by Schdll and co-workers [133] and in the recent
book [134].
