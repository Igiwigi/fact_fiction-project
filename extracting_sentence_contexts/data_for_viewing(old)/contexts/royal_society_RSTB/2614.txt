two adjacent trabeculae, an “ irregular pore” appears in the septum. The Lophoserinz
show the same feature.

(3.) The fascicle of fibres has its axis in the median plane of the septum, but may
bend out in unpaired fashion towards an interseptal loculus, and give origin there
to asynapticula. This feature is, perhaps, the most characteristic for Hupsammew in
contradistinction to the Lophoserine, Fungine, and Pseudoastreine. To it is due
the occurrence of synapticulz, not in series above one another, but irregularly.

(4.) A great variety in the precise course and position of synapticular calcareous
bars gives the skeleton of Hupsammia at its peripheral portion a certain resemblance
with the involved meshes of coonenchyme in Madrepora and Turbinaria. Again, the
fact that many synapticule are directed obliquely inwards and upwards towards
the calyx shows the independence of the synapticula and its analogy with the growth-
pavt of a radial trabecula. The canalicular system of the Eupsammine, E.H., varies
we may say between the less complicated Fungia type and the more highly dif-
ferentiated “perforate” type, but it is the least constant of all features in the
Eupsamming, and the last that may serve as a systematic basis.

(5.) From the above microscopic study of skeletal features, the genus Hupsammia
will be seen to have much in common with the Fungidex. It is very significant to
find that the anatomical relations of another genus belonging to the Eupsammine
show very marked affinities with those of Fungide. The species Stephanophylha
JSormosissima has been described by Fowxsr (“ Madreporaria, IV.,” Q. J. M.S,
February, 1888), who writes:—“In several respects Stephanophyllia exhibits a
