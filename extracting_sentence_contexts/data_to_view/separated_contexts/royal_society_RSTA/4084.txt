per square inch, and between temperatures of 227°5° and 327°5° F.

The mean value of CK» throughout this range of pressure and temperature is
0°2819. Outside this range of pressure it is impossible to give very accurate results,
but as no great and distinct variations actually appear, it would seem that the
constancy of CK, could be accepted beyond this range of pressure and temperature. The fact that the product CK, is practically constant is of very great importance,
as it will simplify many deductions from expressions in which CK, only occurs as a
product. For example, formula B just quoted gives a relation between v, T, C, and K>
