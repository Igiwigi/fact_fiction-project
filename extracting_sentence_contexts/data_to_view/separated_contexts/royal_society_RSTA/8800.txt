A tentative law of diminution of amplitude
suggests itself, viz., Ste’, where 8 is tlie length of the path. The factor would

then be Se ‘9, The numerical labour of testing this is rather serious, and from
LS

some rough trials I do not think it contains much promise of explaining the
observations. Accordingly, I pass to the second factor, which is within our powers and which
goes a considerable way to explaining the facts. In so far as it fails it may give a
clue to the proper form of the first factor. Starting with epicentral distance A, Table III. give the corresponding angle e and
fig. 2 the values of H and V for the first impulse P.
