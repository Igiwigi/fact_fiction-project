thus defining replay ‘content’.

Strong input can drive ripple-band activity in hippo-
campal, cortical and even some subcortical structures.
Numerous models seek to explain ripple rhythmogenesis.
We emphasize that many models are not mutually exclusive

and operate under different physiological circumstances;
however, a preponderance of evidence points towards a cru-
cial role of interneurons in pacing neural activity at the
ripple band. Phase resetting of independent oscillators
with common resonant properties can induce strong coher-
ence. This fact presents a challenge in identifying the role of
synaptic inputs in driving ripples within the hippocampus
and coupling of activity between the hippocampus
and the cortex. Ultimately, better perturbation experiments
and models will be required to untangle these recurrent
knots.

We point out three interacting mechanisms that can set
the sequence of neural recruitment during ripples: differ-
ences in the balance of feed-forward excitation and
inhibition, differences in intrinsic excitability and the pat-
tern of lateral inhibition. Crucially, these mechanisms are
very likely to interact, especially under a scenario where
