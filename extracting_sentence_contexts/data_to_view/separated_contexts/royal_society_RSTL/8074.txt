MEcKEL describes the great pectoral as consisting
of a superficial and two deep portions; the first of these, he says, arises from the
sternum and clayicle (my dissections, as noticed above, do not bear out the latter part of
the statement ; but as he did not separate the clavicular deltoid from the sternal pectoral,
he looked on the origin of the latter as part of that of the former), the second part is
clavicular, and the third also from the clavicle. In their Plates of Pteropus, CUvIER

and LAUniiard figure this muscle as the petit pectoral; HuxPnRy regards it as a part
of the great pectoral, and corrects CUVIER's error of assigning to it a costal origin. The
fact of this muscle and the pars sternalis receiving their nervous supply from the ante-
rior thoracic nerve, a branch of the external cord of the brachial plexus, settles the
question of its morphological nature. Pectoralis minor is absent in every species. Pectoralis quartus in all is a distinct, well-developed muscle, largest proportionally
in Noetulina, smallest in the Pipistrelle, and yery small in Scotophilus hesperus.
