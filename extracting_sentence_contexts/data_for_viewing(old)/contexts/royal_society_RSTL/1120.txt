only to about 6 parts in 1000, and we are inclined to attribute
it in great measure to the difficulty in exhausting the lungs as
completely after an experiment as before it; the first expira-
tion being made into the open air, the last into the apparatus.

9. The experiments upon oxygen gas prove that the quan-
tity of air remaining in the lungs and its appendages is very
considerable, and that, without a reference to this circum-
stance, all experiments upon small quantities of gas are liable
to inaccuracy.

Other important conclusions might perhaps be drawn from
the facts related in this paper, but having already trespassed
largely upon the time of the Society, we shall abstain from
any farther remarks, until we bring forward a new series
of experiments.
