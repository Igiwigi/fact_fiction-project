We have thus obtained the symmetric product for the quintic wanting in its
$second term ; but it seems desirable on many grounds to calculate the product for the
erfect form. A variety of methods of performing this calculation might be suggested.
e reyersal of the problem of transformation appears, at first sight, the most easy and
practicable, and if in the foregoing expression for IT the following substitutions be
made, viz—
2b? ESC for c,

= Ea AF d ford,
3h6% 3b? 2bd

=_ SS e for 6,
5 6th
= 4b5 te , bd b
2 H—pta-z +f forf,
She result will be the symmetric product for the complete quintic
i= (1,6, 0, 4, 6, fo, 1)'=

But it will be found on trial that this process, though apparently simple, does in point
fact inyolye prodigious labour. Mr. SA\MvuEL Biils of Hawton, who kindly undertook

Ahat portion of the expression into which F* enters.
