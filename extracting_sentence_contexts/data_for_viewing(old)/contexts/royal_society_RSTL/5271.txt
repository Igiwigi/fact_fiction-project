The identity in composition and properties of this acid, and the substance formed
by the action of alkalies on rubian, leave no doubt of their being the same.

Rubiadine—This substance, which has not hitherto been observed among the
products derived from madder, bears a close resemblance in its appearance and many
of its properties to rubianine, the place of which it in fact occupies in the series of
substances produced by the action of alkalies on rubian. Besides its composition,
however, there are several properties belonging to it s0 characteristic, that it cannot
be confounded with rubianine or any of the substances previously described. When
crystallized from alcohol, it is obtained in the shape of small yellow or orange-coloured
needles. A very minute degree of impurity, however, seems to prevent its assuming
a crystalline form, in which case it is obtained in small granular masses, or as a yellow
amorphous powder. It may be purified by dissolving it in a small quantity of boil-
ing alcohol, and adding to the boiling solution either hydrated oxide of lead, or prot-
oxide of tin. On filtering boiling hot and allowing to cool, it crystallizes out.
When heated on platinum foil, it melts and burns with flame. When cautiously
heated between two watch-glasses, it may be almost entirely yolatilized. On the
lower glass a very slight carbonaceous residue is left, while the upper glass is covered
