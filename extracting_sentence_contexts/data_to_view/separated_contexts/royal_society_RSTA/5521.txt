Figure 2 shows how the minimum work of atmospheric methane
capture varies with concentration and outlet purity, while holding capture fraction constant
at 70%. As the concentration of methane increases, the minimum work of separation decreases. This
fact emphasizes that addressing higher concentration sources first is desirable, just as it is for CO2
removal, and that as more CHy is captured directly from ambient air, further capture will require
more work per unit CH4y removed as the background concentration drops. However, this may
be remedied by strategically centring efforts of methane capture near regions where the methane
concentration is consistently higher than in ambient air, including those associated with oil or
natural gas extraction, abandoned coal mines, landfills and agriculture [35]. Technically, such
efforts would be better described as methane mitigation because they target oxidizing elevated
methane concentrations from known sources rather than methane at average concentrations in the
bulk atmosphere.
