Even in the Suidee the two middle digits are so largely developed in comparison
with the lateral ones, and all the bones of the carpus and tarsns have been s0 completely
taken for the use of these two middle digits, that we shall be guilty of no exaggeration
in stating that the Suidz might lose the lateral digits without their locomotion being at
all impaired. We even witness this process going on in Dicotyles—in which the lateral
digits are 8till more reduced than in the true Suina, and they begin to disappear altogether,
beginning at the external metatarsal. If the lateral digits are till retained in the Suidz,
it is chiefly owing to the fact that the Hogs live generally in marshby places and on
muddy river-banks, where a broad foot is of great importance for not allowing them to
8k deeply into the mud. But if, by some geological change, their habitat should be
transformed into dry grassy plains, there can be no reasonable doubt that they would as
readily lose their lateral digits as the Palzotheroids have lost theirs (perhaps by an
analogous change of habitat) in becoming transformed into the monodactyle Horse. Should this occur only in a limited locality, and under circumstances admitting of no
migration (for instance, on a large island), it is very possible that the Suidz of this
particular island might lose their lateral toes, while others, which continued to live
under the old conditions, would retain theirs.
