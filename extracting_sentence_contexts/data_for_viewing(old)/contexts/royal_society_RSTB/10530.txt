given in electronic supplementary material, table SA4.

Exploratory analyses indicated different patterns of the cladoceran
community body size change depending on whether the com-
munities were dominated by small- or large-bodied taxa (see §3).
We divided the data into two subsets. The large-species dominated
community subset (n = 34, large species having an average body
size > 1mm, see e.g. [32]; species included: D. magna, D. obtusa,
D. pulex and the chydorid Eurycercus lamellatus), involving commu-
nities having more than 5% of large species in terms of abundances
(a 5% cut-off value is inspired by the fact that their body size is large,
so that in terms of biomass their contribution is more substantial),
and the small-species dominated community subset (1 = 50; all
other ponds). All analyses on communities presented below were

done on all three datasets (i.e. the full dataset and the two subsets). (ili) Genetic variation and phenotypic plasticity in body size in
For the analyses involving genetic variation in D. magna, only the Daphnia magna
large-species subset was used as community dataset. Data analyses We tested for the effect of urbanization and temperature exposure
