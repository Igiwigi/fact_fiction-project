silver or some other alloy possessing a small temperature-coeflicient, a compensating

% coil of copper or platinum having a large coefficient. The resistance of the compen-

> sating coil is adjusted so that its change of resistance per degree is equal to that of
: the coil it is intended to compensate, while its actual resistance at any temperature
£ is much smaller, the ratio of the resistances being inversely as the temperature-
coefficients. Each compensator is placed in the box in close proximity to the coil it
is intended to compensate, so as to be always at the same temperature, but coil and
compensator are connected on opposite sides of the bridge-wire, so that the balance
depends only on their difference, which remains constant for any change of tempera-
ture, provided that the adjustment has been properly effected. The advantage of the
method lies in the fact that this adjustment can be made with extreme accuracy, by
testing coil and compensator together over the required range of temperature before
they are connected in their places in the box. But the method has not come into
general use, partly on account of the labour involved in the adjustment of the coils,
and also in part owing to the discovery shortly afterwards of manganin and other
alloys of small temperature-coefficient, which are fairly satisfactory for ordinary work
though inferior, in my opinion, to the compensation method for work of precision

The objections to manganin, for instance, are—(1) That it cannot be perfectly
