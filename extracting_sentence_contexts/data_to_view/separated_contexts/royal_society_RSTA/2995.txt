Note that the pseudo-threshold values
were obtained by the intersection between the curve p/10 (because we are considering a noise
model where idle qubits fail with probability p/10 and are concerned about quantum memories)
and the logical failure rate curve of the exRec. The differences in pseudo-thresholds are primarily
due to the larger number of locations in the fault-tolerant circuits of the dodecahedron code
compared to the surface-17 code circuits as well as the fact that both codes have the same distance. In fact, just by counting the number of pairs of CNOT gates in an EC unit, one can get an indication
of the pseudo-threshold. For the small stellated dodecahedron code the number of CNOT gates
is 3 x 5 x 22 =330 so that 7) = 54285, while for Surface-17 the number of CNOT gates in an
EC-unit is 3 x 4 x 8 = 96 so that (%) = 4560, in rough correspondence with the c’s in pi (p) = cp”
observed in figure 10.
