Another circumstance in which structural solution is
possible is when what is sought is a small change in the struc-
ture from a known one. There are no symmetry restrictions to
such a difference structure, only that it be close to the known
dark structure (the same assumption as made in the differ-
ence Fourier method of time-resolved crystallography).
Such a solution is of great significance in that it suggests
the possibility of following the fast time variation of the
structure of a photoexcited biomolecule of uncrystallized bio-
molecules in solution under conditions which somewhat

Due to the fact that the particles are presented to the XFEL
beam in random orientations, the individual intensities will
not be obviously related to intensities on other diffraction
patterns. However, it has been pointed out [9,17] that the
average angular correlations over a large number of such
diffraction patterns can yield a quantity that is directly rela-
ted to the three-dimensional diffraction volume of a single
particle. If an oversampled version of the three-dimensional
diffraction volume can be extracted from this ensemble of dif-
fraction patterns, modern iterative phasing algorithms [18,19]
would be expected to be able to reconstruct the three-
dimensional electron density of an individual particle from
the multiple diffraction patterns expected to be measured in
