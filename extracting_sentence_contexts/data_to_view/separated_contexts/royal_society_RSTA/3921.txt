Once again, a well-founded and efficient exchange
protocol between the two representations is key to the success of this strategy.


(b) Chimaera simulation with mesoparticles

This paper is heavily centred upon LB as a concrete vehicle to chimaera implementations, but it is
clear that other mesoscale approaches, such as dissipative particle dynamics [24] or multi-particle
collision (MPC) methods [24,25], may well serve the same purpose. In principle, mesoparticle
methods are less suited to cover the broad range scales embraced by LB, because they do not
share the same particle-field duality. In other words, the fact of moving smooth fields (the discrete
distributions) along straight particle trajectories is a major strength of the LB formalism and,
although this entails limitations in reaching down to molecular scales, it provides nonetheless an
amazing capability to escalate the large hydrodynamic scales up to fully developed turbulence. On the other hand, (stochastic) mesoparticle methods naturally incorporate the thermal and
statistical fluctuations which are essential to reach down to the microscale physics. :
Thus, there appears to be a nice complementarity between the two approaches, one that reflects :3
the two major avenues of kinetic theory: Boltzmann distribution functions versus Langevin : =
stochastic dynamics. 13
The computational implications of such complementarity appear well worth pursuing in detail 1
for the years to come. The subject is exciting and up for grabs.
