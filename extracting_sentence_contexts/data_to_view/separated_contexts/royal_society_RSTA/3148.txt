Suppose now all the conditions of p. 13 are satisfied. Then whatever value of k be
taken, we have 6”, = 0, so that, as far as we have seen, the transformation does not

render the solution any nearer. We must, in fact, proceed to consider the further conditions for the case when the
roots 0, are equal (p. 13). Suppose, for instance, the first of these conditions is not satisfied, then putting
k =n, we shall have @',, =... = @,,, the conditions then necessary before the deter-
mination of 6,,-, will be satisfied, and we shall eventually obtain a binomial equation
for 6;,-1 of degree n in which the constant term does not vanish ; the roots of this
equation being all different, the subnormal integral exists. Thus we may go through all the equations of condition in turn.
