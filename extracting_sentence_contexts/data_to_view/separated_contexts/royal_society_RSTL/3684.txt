I sball moreover be better pleased to deal
with the objection after it has assumed a more definite form in the hands of its pro-
poser, for I entertain no doubt that it is capable of a sufficient answer. The second
objection M. MaTTEuccr considers to be a more grave one. The facts are as follows :â€”
the repulsion of a mass of crystallized bismuth depends upon the direction in which
the mass is magnetized. When the magnetizing force acts in a certain direction, the
intensity of magnetization, and the consequent repulsion of the mass, is a maximum,
This is proved by placing the mass upon the end of a torsion beam and bringing its
several directions successively into the line of the magnetic force. Porss0Nn would
have called such a direction through the mass a principal axis of magnetic induction,
and I have elsewhere called it a line of elective polarity.
