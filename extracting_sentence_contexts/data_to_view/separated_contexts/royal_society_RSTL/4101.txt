=] A YEAR ago I placed before the Royal Society the results of an investigation © On
= the Nature of the Force by which Bodies are repelled from the Poles of a Magnet*.”
& The simultaneous exhibition of attraction and repulsion in the case of magnetized
S Iron is the fact on which the idea of the polarity of this substance is founded ; and it
© resvlted from the investigation referred to, that a corresponding duality of action was
.S manifested by bismuth. In those experiments the bismuth was the moveable object
;Z upon which fixed magnets were caused to act, and from the deflection of the bismuth
= its polarity was inferred. But, inasmuch as the action is reciprocal, we ought also to
S obtain evidence of diamagnetic polarity by reversing the conditions of experiment ; by
2 making the magnet the moveable object, and inferring from its deflection the polarity
Ss ofthe mass which produces the deflection.
