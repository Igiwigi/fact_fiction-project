of the individual workers, but detailed comparison and scrutiny of the material left little
doubt that some of the investigators were dishonest in their field work.

212. Crop record. In the next stage of the work, namely, preparation of crop records, a
similar detailed comparison was carried out. Here the absolute discrepancy was something
of the order of 9 or 10%, while the algebraic discrepancy was less than 2 °/. On the whole
inaccuracies at this stage were far smaller in magnitude than the mistakes which occurred
at the stage of field survey. This is, of course, just what may be expected in view of the fact
that the field survey has had to be carried out under far more difficult conditions.

213. Area measurement. A detailed study was also made of errors occurring at the stage of
copying the area of individual plots from revenue records which were kept in the district
headquarters and were thus scattered all over the province. This arrangement was difficult
to supervise, and large mistakes were detected. From 1940, therefore, the practice was
adopted of measuring the area of individual plots directly in the Laboratory with the help
of photographic scales. The absolute discrepancy by this method is of the order of 2%, and
the algebraic discrepancy appreciably below 1%.

214. Border effect. In a sample survey on a large scale there were naturally many other
sources of error, some of which were studied experimentally. For example, there was the
