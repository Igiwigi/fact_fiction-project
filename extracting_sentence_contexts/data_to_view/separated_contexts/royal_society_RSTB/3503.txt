It will appear from the scheme that there is a general coincidence of the regions of
the different germ-layers therein mapped out. Further, a striking apparent
similarity between this “ primitive-streak area” and the early “embryonic area” ot
a mammalian or avian ovum cannot fail to be recognised. But the notion of any
complete morphological correspondence between these is excluded on a full considera-
tion of the facts, more especially that of the present position of the primitive knot,
which, in the meantime, lies wholly in front of, and totally unconnected with, the
“ primitive-streak area.” The more detailed structure of the primitive streak and its area may now be
further elucidated with the aid of figures illustrative of its sectional anatomy. 56 PROFESSORS J. T. WILSON AND J. P. HILL.
