Dr. Levyp1GÂ®, in his paper on the Agamic Reproduction of Aphis, and Prof :
HuxLEY (1. c. pl. 36) have figured in the terminal chamber certain round, nucleated ce]
any one of which may develope itself into a germinal vesicle, and 80 pass down the ti ,
and form around itself the future egg. These 80-called cells are probably homologoy

with the nuclei of the vitelligenous cells.

Dr. Levp1c als, in his paper on Coceus hesperidum, figures certain large nucleated
cells in the upper chamber of the short, egg-tubes, but having overlooked the true
he scems to have (if I understand him right) considered these bodies
as the equivalents of the germinal vesicle, whereas in fact they are true vitelligenous
differing neither in position nor appearance from the type present in the other

germinal vesicle,

cells,

Homoptera.
Professor LEUCKART also (7. c.) has described these cells in Aphis, Coccus, and Solenobia

lichenella, and adopts in reference to them the same opinion as Professors STEIN and

HUXLEY.
