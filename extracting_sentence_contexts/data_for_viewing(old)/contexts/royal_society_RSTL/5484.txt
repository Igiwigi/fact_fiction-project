Second Corollary. —TarorEM. In fig. 6, let ADM, BCN be any two curves of no
transmission, indefinitely prolonged in the direction of X, and let any two isothermal

curves Q,Q,, Q,Q,, corresponding respectively to any two quantities of actual heat
Q,, Q,, be drawn across them. Then will the indefinitely-prolonged areas MABN,
MDCN, bear to each other the simple ratio of the quantities of actual heat Q,, Q..
Or, denoting those areas respectively by H,, H,—

This corollary is the geometrical expression of the law of the maximum efficiency
of a perfect thermo-dynamic engine, already investigated by other methods. In fact,
the area MABN represents the whole heat expended, or the latent heat of expansion,
the actual heat at which heat is received being Q, ; MDCN, the heat lost, or the
latent heat of compression, which is carried off by conduction at the actual heat Q, ;
and ABCD (being the indicator-diagram of such an engine), the motive power, pro-
duced by the permanent disappearance of an equivalent quantity of heat; and the
efficiency of the engine is expressed by the ratio of the heat converted into motive
power to the whole heat expended, viz.—
