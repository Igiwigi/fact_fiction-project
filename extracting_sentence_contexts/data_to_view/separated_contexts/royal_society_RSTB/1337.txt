From about the same region conspicuously degenerate fibres arch round
Re grey matter, to cross the raphé to the opposite side, where some turn down in the
faphé i in the position of (C’), whilst others, derived from more anterior decussating
res, extend forwards and outwards and come to a position (B), behind the inner
I@rder of the normal crusta and close to the mesial and dorsal aspect of the lemniscus. ese anterior decussating fibres will have in their course passed to the mesial and
Sntral aspect of the red nucleus, or even partly through the anterior part of the
Bicleus and of the superior cerebellar peduncle which runs down from it. In fact,
Be fibres of both tracts must considerably intermingle. This is rendered clearer by
cfauparison with cases in which, owing to the removal of one lobe of the cerebellum,
Be superior cerebellar peduncle has degenerated upwards to the red nucleus. = The fibres which, having decussated as above and crossed the middle line to the
Bposite side, have turned down in the raphé (tiefes Mark), in the position of C’, fig.
