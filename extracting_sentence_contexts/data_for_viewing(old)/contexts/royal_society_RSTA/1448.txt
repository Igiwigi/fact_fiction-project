around that time.

The ‘unbundling’

One such change was the ‘unbundling’, ie. separation of the sale of software and services
from the sale of hardware, starting in 1969 with IBM ([57], pp. 106-107). Up until that point,
corporate profits had been driven by manufacture and marketing of hardware. Therefore, the
cost of software and services had been combined, or ‘bundled’, with the cost of hardware. Each


hardware model was highly specialized, as consequently was the software written for it. As a
result, manufacturers had little incentive to sell software separately from hardware. They also had
no incentive to prevent software from being shared widely. In fact, the widespread distribution
of programs for a specific model often led to user-contributed updates, which improved sale
prospects for that model ([32], p. 5). This dynamic affected early corporate motivations for
investment in software development. It also affected how companies distributed source code,
and the relationship they kept with volunteer developers (e.g. users in academia operating the
hardware, typically researchers and technicians).

The unbundling decision by IBM was precipitated by the threat of an antitrust lawsuit by the
US government, on the charge that the bundling of hardware and software was anticompetitive.
More broadly, the decision captured an inevitable transition in the computer industry
([57], p. 169). Hardware manufacturers had begun to realize that software development required
substantial effort, and that it held potential as a revenue stream in and of itself ([32], p. 4). For
example, the introduction of high-level programming languages meant that software could be
