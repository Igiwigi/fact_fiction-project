radial tubes, as well as the pointing of the polypite to the unsevered tube in a specimen
prepared as represented in fig. 8, would both be explained by the further supposition
that when such a ganglion chain is stimulated—either directly or by conduction of the
stimulus from a distance—the ganglionic elements discharge their influence, and 80 add
to the strength of the original stimulus. According to the second of the above suppo-
sitions (viz. 6), the fact of the high excitability of the nutrient tubes would be explained
by the consideration that a stimulus applied to the snupposed nerye-trunk would directly
affect a greater number of the plexus-elements than would a stimulus applied to any
other part of the bell. The additional fact to be met, viz. the pointing of the polypite
to a single unsevered tube, is not quite 80 easy to explain on the present suppoxsition;
for if the assumed nerve-trunk is identical in function with a true nerve-trunk, the
afferent elements collected in it ought to communicate to the polypite the impression of
having had their distal terminations irritated ; and therefore the fact of a number of
8uch elements being collected into a single trunk ought not to cauxe the polypite to refer
a distant seat of irritation to that trunk rather than to any of the parts from which the
plexus-clements may emanate. Concerning this difficulty, however, I may observe that
we seem to have in it one of those cases in which it would be very unsafe to argue with
any confidence from the highly integrated nervous systems with which we are best
acquainted to the primitive nervous systems with which we are now concerned. And
although it would occupy too much space to enter into a discussion of this subject, I
may further observe that I think it is not at all improbable that the polypite of Tia-
ropsis indicans 8hould, in the absence of more definite information, refer a distant seat
of injury to that tract of collected afferent elements through which it actually receives
the strongest stimulation.
