equation (27), § 55 to be zero. In this case, of course, we assume that for solids the
normal type of stress is the stress that, with identical values of H’ and d’ would exist
ina vacuum. Thus

For a vacuum, ¢'o = — 20K,7!d'od' — poH'oH'/87 . . .  (80),

but it is needless to say that this is not perfectly satisfactory. The question may be
asked why, in the present case, the stress of equation (29) should not be still retained
as the normal one? The answer is, that the equation [(30), § 55] from which it is
derived, and which actually must, in every exact discussion, be taken in its place, is a
wholly unsuitable one for a solid, while equation (27), § 55, is a suitable one.
Again it may be asked, Why not retain the stress equation in its original form
$ = — 2m7!Mly, for solids? The answer to this is, that the important fact that
the great majority of solids behave magnetically like a vacuum is not thereby readily
taken account of.

69. To compare these stresses and their effects with Maxwetv’s, it must first
be noted that Maxwett has only investigated the electrostatic part of his stress
for the case of a series of charged conductors surrounded by a dielectric that behaves
electrostatically like a vacuum. _I consider myself at liberty then to substitute any-
thing for the electrostatic part of his stress which reduces to his for that particular
case. The stress he obtains in Chapter V. of Part I. of his treatise is — 27K,~1d'( )d’.
For the particular case mentioned this may be written
