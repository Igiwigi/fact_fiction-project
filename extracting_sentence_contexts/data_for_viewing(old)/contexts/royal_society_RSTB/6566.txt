suggested the action of a ciliary tract on the left wall. After they had been carried
downwards a little way to about the level of the food cord, the direction of movement
was again changed, this time backwards, and they joined up with the food cord. It is
apparent that the downward and backward movement coincided exactly with the
movement that would be set up by the lateral ciliated tract (the movements were
actually observed before the interior of the mid-gut had been investigated, and led to
the conclusion that some sort of ciliary organ must be present on the left wall), and it
follows that part of the function of the latter is to collect and restore to the cord
material which has been swept off from it. That material should break away from the
cord is easy to understand, for the rotation is not a regular one, but involves much
friction with the walls which would naturally tend to disrupt the surface of the cord.
Further evidence that particles were breaking off from the surface was provided in
this same specimen by the fact that as rotation continued the wall of the posterior half
of the mid-gut acquired a red lining which at intervals was sloughed off and restored
to the cord, only to be rapidly replaced, while conclusive evidence in support of this
will be adduced below in connexion with the discussion of the function of the ilio-colon
ring.

What is not so easy to understand is why the particles should pass forwards for a little
distance after leaving the cord. Careful examination reveals no ciliary mechanism
on the wall which would account for this, and the only other possible explanation
seems to be that they are involved in a reverse eddy set up by the backward current
in the ventral groove. There is justification for assuming the existence of such an eddy,
for with the food cord blocking the passage between the mid-gut and the ilio-colon
ring, the mid-gut is practically a closed chamber, and in view of the strength of the
