tact of the two metals, in cases when small slips of zinc and platina were em-
ployed, was quite sufficient to destroy or suspend the usnal operation of che-
mical affinity. Thus, in numerous instances of the decompositions of metallic
compounds, the platina remained covered with the reduced metal during the
contact of the zine; but on removing the zinc, the coating was readily re-
dissolved by the slight excess of acid present. The transition of the reduced
metal to the surface of the platina, is the effect that gives to the method a
beauty, simplicity, and delicacy, exceeding, in my opinion, all other modes of
detecting the metals already referred to, together with a number of others
which remain to be noticed.

As this paper has already exceeded the limits at first intended, I shall defer
noticing a number of useful applications of the facts, until I shall have the
honour of submitting to the Society the remaining part of the subject.
