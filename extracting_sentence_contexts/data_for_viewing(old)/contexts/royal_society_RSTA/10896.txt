* Before questioning whether man or woman (relatively to stature, body weight, or other character) has
the greater brain weight, it seems desirable to settle whether brain weight in either sex alone, absolutely,
or relatively to some other character, has anything to do with intellectual al vility.

easily be demonstrated. Or again because English women have a mean brain weight
of 1235 grs, and French women of 1142 grs., are we to argue that English women
are intellectually abler than French women? The fact is that to solve a problem ot
this kind we ought to keep within one fairly equally nourished class, and within one
local race and actually correlate brain size and ability. I do not see how this can be
done for brain weight, but it seems to me quite possible for the capacity of the brain
chamber estimated from external measurements.

(15.) Conclusions. I have now completed the discussion of the three problems T
proposed to investigate. It will be seen that the accuracy of predictions depends
sensibly on two factors: (i) the existence of suitable data upon which the regression
formule can be based and (ii) the number of measuremeuts used to form an estimate.
Thus in the third fundamental problem we do not get as good absolute results as we
might hope to do, because we have not really at present available the best data
possible. Again in the first fundamental problem we cannot expect to reconstruct
