and a coloured stage.

16. The description now given of the nucleated blood-cell of the Skate in the un-
coloured $tage, and a comparison of figures 5 a. and 2 6. will show that it resembles
the granule blood-cell after its granules have been dissolyed by the action of acetic
acid; the only difference being that in the former the cellzeform nucleus is larger
and more developed.

17. This resemblance, and the circumstance that corpuscles occur in which the
cellzeform nucleus is large, but still snrrounded by a few granules (fig. 4 b. ; se also
the corresponding corpuscle in the Lamprey, represented in fig. 2.), and which may
be viewed as a transition from the granule to the nucleated cell, go to prove that the
nucleated blood-cells are developed from the granule blood-cells—are, in fact, the
granule blood-cells with the celleform nucleus developed, at the expense of the
granules which have disappeared.

* The name * granule-cell” I have borrowed from Professor VocrL of Gottingen, who first employed it to
designate a form of cell which is deyeloped in inflammatory exudations.

18. The conclusion to be drawn from what has now been said in regard to the
relationship between the granule blood-cell and the nucleated blood-cell is, that they
