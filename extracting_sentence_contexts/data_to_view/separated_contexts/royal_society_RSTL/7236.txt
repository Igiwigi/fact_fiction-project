PROFESSOR KOPP ON THE SPECIFIC HEAT OF SOLED BODIES. 81

with the observed ones; this is less the case with metallic acids and oxygen salts, for
which calculation mostly gives results far too large. GARNIER* drew, further, from
the above proposition the conclusion, that the atomic weight of hydrogen, chlorine, &c.
must in fact be taken only half as great as the equivalent weight ; for only by assuming
this smaller atomic weight is the mean atomic weight such that its product, with the
specific heat is near 3. In 1852 BaxcalariÞ repeated that the specific heat of an atom of a compound body
(that is, its atomic heat) is equal to the sum of the specific heats of the individual con-
stituent simple atoms, and showed, from a series of examples (oxides, chlorides, sulphates,
and nitrates), that, according to that proposition, the atomic heats of many compounds
S may be calculated in tolerable approximation with those derived from REGNAULT'S expe-
© rimental investigations, if, for the elements which he investigated, the atomic heats
derived from his determinations be taken as a basis, that is, for oxygen (O=8) the
atomic heat 189; for chlorine (Cl=17:75) 321; for nitrogen (N=7) 3-11. © CanxizaRo (m 18584) has used the proposition, that, in the sense above taken, uni-
