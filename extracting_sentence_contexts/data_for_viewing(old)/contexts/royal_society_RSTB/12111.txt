RB, oncoproteins from multiple DNA tumour virus families
bind and inactivate p53. In addition to large T antigen,
adenovirus E1B and E4orf6 and high-risk HPV E6 also

neutralize p53 function to support transformation and tumor-
igenesis [79-81]. Studies of the mechanism of E6 action
resulted in the identification of E6-associated protein
(E6AP), the first mammalian ubiquitin E3 ligase. The E6
protein binds to E6AP, hijacking it to ubiquitinate p53 and
tag it for proteasome-mediated degradation [82,83].

The central role of DNA tumour viruses in our understand-
ing of cancer is illustrated nowhere more clearly than by the fact
that studies of these viruses led to the discovery and character-
ization of RB and p53, the two major tumour suppressor
pathways disrupted in human cancer. And the two pathways
are connected. p53 is a transcription factor that activates
expression of genes that regulate the activity of the RB protein.
RB itself regulates the action of the E2F1 transcription factor
and other members of the E2F family that control expression
of genes required for cell cycle progression. E2F1 was discov-
ered by Joseph Nevins and colleagues because of its ability to
regulate transcription of the adenovirus E2 gene and has
since been shown to play a major role in cell cycle control
[84]. The discovery that three entirely distinct DNA tumour
