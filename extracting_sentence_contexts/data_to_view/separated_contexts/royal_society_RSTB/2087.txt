But if so,
the guard cells are practically less sensitive than the rest of the leaf, since they fail
close when the leaf is actually suffering. ie The “ preliminary opening,” which has been described in § 3, seems to show
“phat the guard cells are not the first to wither ; it may also mean that they rob the
Best of the leaf of water, as above suggested. But the fact that they soon wither
dnd close shows that this source of water can only help the guard cells in cases
Shere the general transpiration is slight, as in very moist air. If the guard cells had
Bis power to any great extent, it would, as above pointed out, be a bad arrange-
Hent, and the facts given in § 7, showing that the stomata close before the leaf
Sithers perceptibly, prove that the slowness in reaction of the guard cells, if it
“Exists at all, has under ordinary conditions no marked effect. "8 The outcome of the above discussion of this difficuit subject is, that we have no
vidence of a specialised sensitiveness in the guard cells.
