After being used several times the solution had a distinctly blue colour due to th
presence of a small quantity of copper dissolved from the anode. It is difficult
account for the increase in the weight of the deposit. Since silver has a high
electvo-chemical equivalent than any of the metals likely to be present as impurit
in the anode the increase could hardly be due to this cause, and this view is furt
supported by the fact that on dissolving the heavy deposits in pure nitric acid, sil
nitrate was obtained, which, when dissolved in water, gave the same weight of depos
as the fresh solutions, It was at first thought that the increase might be connecté
with secondary reactions occurring during electrolysis; for, according to cert
observers,* the greyish deposit which forms on the anode during a deposition is sil
oxide, and oxidation could only be the result of secondary decomposition. A quant
of the greyish deposit was therefore detached from the anode by a stream of co
water, and after being well washed in cold water was kept until the weight
