To simulate the propagation of impact-generated tsunami waves, the governing equations of
the respective wave theories must be able to handle nonlinear waves and the different profiles of
the horizontal velocity. The Boussinesq wave theory is an excellent candidate for such a theory.
However, the nonlinear processes that result in dispersion acting on time and length scales require
very fine temporal and spatial resolutions on top of the demanding wave theory required to
adequately simulate the wave dynamics. The next section will cover some of the prominent
approaches to study the evolution of impact-generated tsunami waves.

4. Quantitative assessment

jumerous attempts have been made to quantify impact-generated tsunami waves, including the
formation of waves, how they propagate across the ocean and the run-up process at the coast.
The fact that no conclusive answer has been found to the question of whether impacts in the


marine environment produce mega-tsunamis of greater dimensions than any other generation
mechanism is due to deviating results from different methodological approaches.

(a) Analogue experiments

The first estimates are based on underwater nuclear explosion experiments suggesting an
empirical relationship between the energy Y equivalent of kilotonnes of TNT (1 kt TNT = 4.186 x
10!7J; in an impact event, the energy corresponds to the kinetic energy of the impactor), the wave
amplitude A as a function of distance r, and water depth h [27]: A = 45(h/ r(Y)Â°>. Gault & Sonett
[1] found similar scaling laws by conducting impact experiments with water-covered targets in
