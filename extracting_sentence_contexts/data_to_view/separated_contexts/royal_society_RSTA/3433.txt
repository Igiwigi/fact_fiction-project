Thus, it seems that in geology the subjective component of the process of decision-making
is no less important than in cognitive psychology or economics. As was already pointed out,
this viewpoint was presented in great detail in the paper of Baddeley et at. [11] devoted to the
comparative analysis of decision-making in geophysics and the humanities. In fact, the aforementioned subjective component in geological decision-making is closely
coupled to contextuality of data collected on different scales and by multiphysics techniques. Observations cannot provide a complete picture of subsurface processes. The number of drillings
is restricted.
