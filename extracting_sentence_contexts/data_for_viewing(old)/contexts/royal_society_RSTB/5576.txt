a short distance into the vaginal cavity. In a freshly killed rabbit this opening, the
external mouth of the uterus, is easily probed in either direction. In fresh organs not
previously manipulated, coloured fluid under slight pressure can be made to flow
through this opening, either upward or downward, though the passage downward is
accomplished with somewhat greater ease than that in the reverse direction.

The uterus at its end opposite the vagina diminishes rapidly in calibre and passes
rather abruptly into the uterine tube. The opening leading from the uterus into the
tube is hidden among the membranous folds at the upper end of the uterine cavity.
This opening in the rabbit, as in the sow (ANDERSEN, 1928), is sometimes provided
with an incomplete papilla projecting into the uterus. ANDERSEN was unable to inject
coloured fluid from the uterus of the rabbit into the tube, but I found this relatively
easy to accomplish, as in fact ANDERSEN herself did in the sheep and the sow. Injection
in the opposite direction through this passage in the rabbit was also easily performed.
Whether the freedom of this passage varies with the physiological state of the animal,
as suggested by the work of Lr (1925, a; 1925, b), remains to be ascertained

The body of the rabbitâ€™s uterus is lined with a mucous epithelium mostly devoid of
cilia (KrausE, 1921, p. 157). But over the region of the cervix, that is for about one
centimetre and a half inward from the vaginal mouth of the uterus, the epithelium is
