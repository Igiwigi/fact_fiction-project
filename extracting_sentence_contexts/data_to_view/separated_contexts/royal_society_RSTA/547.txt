Thus deciding which models
provide the most accurate representation of internal variability in the real world is a key challenge,
and is closely linked to the challenge of constraining climate feedbacks. Note that differences in
internal variability among models are even greater on regional scales [20,21]. Note also that none
of the unforced models shown in figure 3 exhibits a centennial trend as large as that observed
(in spite of the fact that some of the models exhibit significant drifts), which is evidence for the
importance of forced signals in the real world (see §§4 and 5). Regression analysis can be used to identify the spatial patterns of climate change that are
related to internal variability in GMST [22]. Application to CMIP5 control simulations (figure 4)
