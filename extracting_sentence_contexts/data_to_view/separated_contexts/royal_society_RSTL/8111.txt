obe 1043:8. By assuming that the water undergoes no change in density, the specific
Zgravity of the liquid after its admixture with the water can be calculated, and proves
Sto be 1258'6 instead of 11916, its original specific gravity. = When a solution of 12 parts of nitrate in 7 of water, which is an almost saturated
one at 15*5, is mixed with 5 times 12 or 60 parts of water, there is also a fall in tem-
Sperature of 4Â®, accompanied by condensation *: for before admixture the specific
-Sgravity of the primary solution is 1298-7, while afterwards its specific gravity,
-Scalculated from that of the mixture, 1064-4, is 1336 ; whence it will be seen that the
Scontraction in volume, though very considerable, is not so great as that experienced by
=the ammonia solution of the nitrate, as might indeed be anticipated from the fact that
>the calculated densities of the nitrate and the liquefied ammonia are both less than their
Zdensities in aqueous solution. > When the liquid (No. 1 in the preceding Tables) containing the least proportion of
Snitrate, namely two thirds of its weight, was mixed with water in the proportion (for the
Svake of comparison) of five parts to one of the nitrate, the temperature was found to fall
only about 4*.
