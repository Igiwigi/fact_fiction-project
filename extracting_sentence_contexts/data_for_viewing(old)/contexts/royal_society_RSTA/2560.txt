Stylianides et al. [2, p. 315], in their analysis of proof and argumentation in mathematics
education research, even assume there is ‘a widespread agreement among mathematics


educators on the significance of proof in students’ learning of mathematics’. This is a
point of view also shared by Stylianides et al. [3], who stress the role proof can play
in emphasizing the logic of mathematics instead of the authority of the teacher or the
textbook.

Nevertheless, as Knuth [13,14] points out, the central role assigned to proof in mathematics
and in mathematicians’ practice is not present in school mathematics. As the author states, in
school, the role of proof has been a peripheral one. ‘This absence of proof in school mathematics
has not gone unnoted and, in fact, has been a target of criticism’ [13, p. 61]. And one of the reasons
usually pointed out by critics is that it can give the students a wrong idea about the nature of the
mathematics [13,14].

As Schoenfeld [15, p. 76] states, proof is a fundamental part of ‘doing, communicating, and
recording mathematics’ and it is not possible to turn it into a separate part of the mathematics,
as usually happens in school. Traditionally, when proof is a reality in school, it includes only
students at high school level and studying geometry [13,14,16]. Ellis et al. [16] consider that it
was only in 2000, when the Principles and Standards [17] were published, that researchers and
policy makers began to argue in favour of incorporating proof in mathematics education at all
levels. The main reason for this argument, beyond the central role of proof in mathematics, is
that it does not seem reasonable to introduce proof only at high school level and to expect that the
students develop an immediate appreciation for it [13,14]. However, this argumentation in favour
