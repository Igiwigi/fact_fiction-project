FARADAY’S “STEEL AND ALLOYS.” 277

After this exposure, the rust was removed by gentle rubbing with a soap of
the type incorporating a hard powder, and the pieces were washed, dried and again
weighed. The results are given in Table VI, which displays the interesting fact that both
platinum and rhodium additions to steel in the amounts to which they are present
appreciably retard corrosion. The improvement effected here is not, however,
sufficient to be of any practical value. That is, while it is possible that under ordinary
conditions the tarnishing or rusting of instruments or mirrors made from these alloys
might take somewhat longer than with carbon steels, Farapay had by no means fully
achieved with them his desired objective.
