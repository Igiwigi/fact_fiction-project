We show in the
following that this connection is not limited to CARL, but applies also to the symmetry-breaking
transverse instabilities studied in [15,16]. Moreover, the connection made in [7,21] referred to the
case where strong damping is present in the system (hence the denomination ‘viscous’ CARL),
which in the Kuramoto analogy translates into the case where the oscillators have zero natural
frequencies (their distribution is a Dirac delta function). We extend here the Kuramoto analogy
to the situation analysed in [15,16], where no damping is present and a finite spread exists in the
natural frequency spread of the fictitious oscillators.

2. Single-mirror optomechanical instabilities

(a) Basic scheme

We consider the single-mirror set-up [23,24] depicted in figure 1, where a cold gas of two-level
atoms is illuminated by a pump beam of amplitude F, frequency w) and wavenumber ky. The
pump beam is detuned by 6 = a9 — wat from the atomic transition (frequency wat, linewidth I’),
and is retroreflected by a mirror of reflectivity R placed at distance d from the cloud to form the
backward beam (amplitude B).
