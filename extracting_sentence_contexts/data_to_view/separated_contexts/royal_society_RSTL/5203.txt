© The land Gasteropoda are distinguished by the peculiar mode of development of their hell, if we may draw
eonclusions for the whole group from Heliz and Clausilia. The original depoxition of the shell in the interior
of the mantle (as in the Loligide among the Cephalopoda) is as yet an isolated fact among the land Gastero-
poda, of which we find no indication in other Gasteropods.” There seems to be a very curious relation between the internal or external nature of a hell, the curvature of
its whorls as regards a vertical plane, and the hzmal or dorsal flexure of the intestine. Take, first, the case of a true external shell, as that of Nautilus or Argonauta, or Atlanta.
