In addition we have the variational equation for the internal energy which can be
left as it stands in the form

- (E++[+,B) sp) +(B- 1b, E+E,} dl):
, / ,
Interpreted in terms of the language of ordinary dynamics these equations imply

that
(PV) E,+(IV) B,+4 (pr paBhia 1 (te, 43 2(B+ E,)

is the force per unit volume at each place tending to accelerate the motion of the
matter, whilst

é (E+ ! [-B))

is the force tending to accelerate the motion of the element of electricity e.

The electrical terms in the first of these results are consistent with those obtained
by Larmor* and others, but the magnetic terms, which are in fact analogous with
the electrical terms depending on the dielectric polarisation, are fundamentally
different from those obtained by these authors. Further, since

it follows that
Curl E = —- id Curl A, c dt

so that our equations are in complete agreement with the most general form of
MAXweELv’s theory.
