continuous with nerve ceils, to ectoderm cells connected with the ganglion cells by
comparatively long processes (fig. 4). From their connections with the ectoderm this
ventral group of nerve cells would appear to be sensory in character, and to form a
sensory system which does not give origin to a definite sensory nerve. They are
connected with the imperfectly segmented series of sense cells which occur on the
ventral surface in close connection with the nerve cords.

On the inner dorsal angle of each of the anterior ganglionic swellings is a cell group
(figs. 4 and 5, int. dorsal cells), the cells of which give off processes to the anterior
commissure, and are also connected by a dorsal series of arcuate fibres with a third
group of cells on the outer dorsal edge of the anterior ganglionic swelling (iid., ext.
dorsal cells). These external dorsal cells, though abutting on the external cells of the
ventral sense plate, yet differ from them in size and in the fact that from them a bundle
of fibres passes through the ganglionic plexus to form the anterior part of the anterior
commissure (fig. 4). The posterior part of the anterior commissure is composed of
fibres which traverse the ganglionic plexus and pass directly out as part of the out-
going nerve bundle (fig. 5). These decussating fibres thus divide the plexus of each
anterior swelling into dorsal and ventral portions, of which the latter is finer and
denser in character. ;

We can therefore distinguish in each half of the anterior portion of the ganglion
three cell groups: (1) the ventral group, which extends under the entire ganglion ;
(2) the external dorsal group, from which decussating fibres pass, forming the anterior
portion of the anterior commissure ; (3) the internal dorsal group. The external and
internal dorsal groups are connected by a bundle of dorsal arcuate fibres.
