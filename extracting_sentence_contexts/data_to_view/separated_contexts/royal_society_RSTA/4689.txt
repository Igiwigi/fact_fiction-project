acting on matter, for that would from this ultimate standpoint be a force acting on a
strain-form spreading from its nucleus all through the medium, not a traction on a
detinite surface bounding the matter. The fact is that transmission of force by a medium, or by contact action so-called,
remains merely a vague phrase until the strain-properties of that medium are
described ; the scientific method of describing them is to assign the mathematical
function which represents its energy of strain, and thence derive its relations of
stress by the principle of virtual work ; a real explanation of the transmission of a
force by contact action must be taken to mean this process. Now in an elastic
medium permeated by centres of permanent intrinsic strain, whether it be the
rotational ether with its contained electrons, or an ordinary elastic solid permeated
by polar strain-nuelei as described above, the specification of the strain-energy of the
medium involyes a mathematical function, not only of the displacement at each
material point of the medium, but also of the positions of these intrinsic strain-
centres which can move independently through it. To derive the play of internal
force, this energy function must be varied with respect to all these independent
quantities ; the result is elastic tractional stress in the medium across every ideal
interface, together with forcive tending to displace each strain-centre, which we can
consider either as resisted by extraneous constraint preventing displacement of the
strain-centre, or as Compensated by the reaction of the inertia of the strain-form
against acceleration.
