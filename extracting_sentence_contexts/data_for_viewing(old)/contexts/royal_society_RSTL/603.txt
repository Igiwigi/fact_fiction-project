Is not this owing to. their being all equally wanting in
transparency ? And does not this afford us a strong presumption
that heat is, in all *cases, excited. and communicated by means
of radiations, or undulations, as I should rather choose to call
them ?

I am sensible, however, that there is another and most im-
portant question to be decided, before these points can be deter-
mined; and that is, whether bodies are cooled in consequence
of the rays they emit, or by those they receive ?

The celebrated experiment of Professor P1cTET, which has:
often been repeated, appears to me to have put the fact beyond
all doubt, that rays, or emanations, which, like light, may be-
concentrated - by concave mirrors, proceed from cold bodies;
and that these rays, when $80 concentrated, are capable of‚Äù
affecting, in a manner perfectly sensible, a delicate air thermo-
meter.
