Here, we show that recovery from MD which started
during the critical period is mediated by potentiation of
responses through the previously deprived eye in young
adult mice. This contrasts with an earlier study in which
adult (more than P120) and old mice (more than P500)
were monocularly deprived for 7 days immediately after a
10-14 day period of DE; in these animals the observed OD
shift was mediated by an increase in non-deprived-eye
responses [35]. Notwithstanding the different sequences of
MD and DE, it is most likely that the differences in eye-
specific changes reflect mechanistic differences between the
response to MD itself and the recovery from MD [31]. This
hypothesis is based on the fact that the same sequence as
employed here (DE after MD) did cause a very pronounced
