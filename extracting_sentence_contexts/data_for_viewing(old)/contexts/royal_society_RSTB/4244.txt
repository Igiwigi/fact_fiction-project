The discovery of a new homology for the Echidna pterygoid presents no difficulty.
The fact that, according to ScHULMANN, a rudimentary muscle connects the Echidna
pterygoid of Ornithorhynchus with the sphenoidal and_petrosal region, shows, as
Gaupr has pointed out, that the bone was originally free. It must therefore, from
its general relations, be some bone belonging to the palato-quadrate series. If the
mammalian pterygoid be really the true reptilian pterygoid, it must be either the
ectopterygoid or the epipterygoid. Gavupp has shown that it is very improbable
that it is the ectopterygoid.

In both monotremes the “ Echidna pterygoid” develops as a membrane bone on
the ventral surface of the ala temporalis : in stage B of Ornithorhynchus it does not
extend at all lateral to this process. This fact affords some additional evidence that
the independently developed part of the ala temporalis is really homologous with
the pars palatina of the palato-quadrate of reptiles; for no one will deny that this
hone belongs to the palato-quadrate series.

The sketch of the phylogenetic development of the epipterygoid of Therapsids,
which I have given above, shows that throughout that group there is a constant
tendency for a special process of the ‘epipterygoid to be developed, which reaches
back towards the quadrate region. In the most advanced group this process actually
passes outside and in front of the quadrate, and the posterior ramus of the pterygoid
has entirely disappeared, that bone lying entirely in front of the basipterygoid
region. In the Cynognathids this part of the epipterygoid has the following
relations :—It articulates with the outer side, and to a small extent with the lower
