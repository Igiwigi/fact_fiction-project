scale-like tips of a few distant sterile bracts. These bracts are probably in serial
continuation with the scales on the peduncle, although their arrangement is obscured
by the much greater length and swollen character of the internodes; at the base of
the receptacle the sterile bracts are of a size and form transitional to the leaves on
the distal part of the peduncle.

A feature worth noting is that in the axils of many of the sterile bracts the surface
of the receptacle is raised into a more or less prominent hump (text-fig. 6), usually
distinguishable from the swollen base of the bract. The entire receptacle is thus
composed of the swollen axis, the swollen bract bases, and these axillary humps,
which, to judge from their vascular supply, are probably vestigial axes (see p. 267).

Attention must be drawn to a curious fact constantly observed in the material at

; PiLGER records 1-2 fertile bracts on each receptacle.

my disposal, namely, that the most distal sterile bract of each receptacle differs from

the others in two respects. Firstly, the tip of the bract is awl-shaped instead of
