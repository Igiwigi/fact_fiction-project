observed accurately, is sufficient evidence of the essential character of this period,
and we cannot agree with Van ’r Horr in his conclusion that the existence of the
induction period is merely “an indication that some necessary precaution has been
omitted.” t

We come now to consider in more detail the hydrogen and chlorine action. The
rate of progress of this action depends largely on the presence of water vapour.
The drier the gases are the slower the action is, so that when the gases are dried
with great care they do not combine completely after three or four days’ exposure
to bright sunlight. It seems, therefore, reasonable to suppose that under ordinary
conditions the water vapour plays an essential part in the combination, and that
without any water vapour present the action would not take place with measurable
velocity. The fact that illumination of the chlorine alone before mixing with

hydrogen makes the action take place more readily, leads us to conclude that the
first stage of the action is the formation of an additive compound from the chlorine
and water vapour. Chlorine does form a hydrate with water, and the departure of
chlorine from HEnry’s law, and other anomalous behaviour in solution, shows that it
