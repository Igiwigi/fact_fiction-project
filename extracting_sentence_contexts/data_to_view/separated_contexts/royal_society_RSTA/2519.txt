Figure 2. A tableau proof, a natural deduction proof, and a Coq proof of the formula in (2.2). a

To make the situation worse, consider figure 2, which shows a proof of our formula (2.2) as an Do
analytic tableau [48] on the left, a natural deduction proof [17,35] on the top right, and as a proof 2S
script in the Coq system [11] on the bottom right. A priori, there is no obvious relation between all ty
these proofs, except for the fact that they prove the same formula. However, the natural deduction : &
proof and the Coq proof script are just two different notations of the same object. But they are not 18
comparable to the tableau proof on the left or the two sequent proofs in figure 1 above.®

Nonetheless, even though syntactically all these proofs look very different from each other,
in principle they all do the same thing: they use A twice to justify B (via the subformula A > B)
and C (via the subformula —A v C), which in turn are then used to justify D (via the subformula
CAB+D).
