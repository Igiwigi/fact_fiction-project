This form relates the change of entropy nu(U) directly to the various irreversible processes that
occur in a system [2]. In other words, the change of entropy drives the irreversible processes,
while the latter lead to the change of entropy.

Notice that the dissipation matrix may depend on the non-equilibrium variables as well as the
conserved ones, while the usual Onsager relation only allows the dependence on the conserved
variables. It was shown in [16] why the dissipation matrix M = M(U) must be positive instead
of semi-positive definite. In fact, this positive definiteness guarantees that (u,v) =0 whenever
q(u, v) =0. This means that the local equilibrium states are those attaining the maximum of the
entropy with respect to the non-equilibrium variable.

We conclude this section with the entropy-production inequality proposed in [28], which follows
from the conservation-dissipation principle. Look at the entropy production in (3.4): = ny(U) -
M(U)n,(U), which is the inner product of the thermodynamic fluxes Q(U) and (entropic) forces
nu(U). It is direct to see that

o = nu(U) - QU) = mo(U) - M(U)no(U)
