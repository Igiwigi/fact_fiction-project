negative transformation, production-perception—feedback)
as within-participant factors. There was no statistical differ-
ence of acceptability between overt situations which depicted
the participant as the user benefiting of the device (M = 6.43),
and situations where the user was an unknown person (M =
6.55; no main effect, F(1, 301) = 0.37, p = 0.54). Neither did the
effect of self-other interact with any of the other variables:
regardless of whether the user was themselves or others, par-

For each situation, we then tested the acceptability of lying
about the true purpose of the device, in order to increase
the transformation’s effectiveness, in two situations which
either involved the user’s lying to their interlocutors, or the
device’s prescriber’s lying to the user themselves.
