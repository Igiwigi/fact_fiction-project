The fact that iron possesses retentiveness, or, in other words, that it remains
- magnetic after a magnetising force has been applied and removed, is of itself sufficient
that there must be hysteresis in the relation of magnetism to magnetising force,
when the changes of the latter are snch that forces of opposite signs are alternately
applied. But it does not follow that hysteresis is necessarily present when the changes
of magnetising force are restricted to one direction and to one s8ign. The case may be
gupposed similar to that of a strained solid.
