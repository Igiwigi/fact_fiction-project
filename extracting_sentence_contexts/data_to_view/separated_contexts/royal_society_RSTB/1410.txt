Thus, we often find the bundles of adjacent internodes lyj
in the same straight line; the forks of a bundle at the node curve round the
leaf-trace, and unite on its opposite side (see one of the bundles in photogra
Plate 72). This may occur in the same specimen which in other parts show
alternation.*

In other cases, the bundles at the node are about twice as numerous ag
going foliar bundles—or, in other words, only about every alternate bundle p
at a given node. (See Plate 78, fig. 11.) Here each bundle must pass throi
internodes, instead of one, before joining on to the trace of another leaf. T
tangential sections, including those of Caleamopitus, similar variations oceurt

We may sum up the facts considered as follows :—The bundle-system of @
bears a general resemblance to that of Hquisetum. A single leaf-trace e
stem from each leaf, and passes vertically downwards to the next node.
simplest cases the bundle here forks, its two branches attaching themselves tot
nating bundles which enter the stem at this node. In other cases both
attach themselves to the same bundle, so that, in this case, there is no
alternation.
