Note that in this case we perform the averaging prior to taking the absolute square, while the
opposite is true for E. Recall that for any real variable x the difference (x?) — (x)? is positive
definite and equivalent to the variance of x. The difference between these two quantities E — Ey
is similarly a positive quantity determined by the variance in the real and imaginary components
of the wavelet among the various occultations. Hence Ey must have a value between 0 and E.
In fact, Eg can only equal E when 4; — ¢; is the same for all occultations, as would be the case
if the opacity variations are entirely due to a single wave with the specified pattern speed and
m-number. For any other signal, Ey will be less than E because of the finite scatter in 9; — i.
Indeed, as N approaches infinity, Ey, should approach zero for these signals (provided we can
sample all possible values of #; — ¢;). The ratio between these two powers

Eg(r,k)
E(r,k)’

Rr, k) = (6.9)
should, therefore, vary between 1 and 0 depending on how well the phase shifts of the observed
data match those derived for the selected m-number and pattern speed.
