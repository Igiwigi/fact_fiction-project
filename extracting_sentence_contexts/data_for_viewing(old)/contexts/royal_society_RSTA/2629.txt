(g) Clustering in biological systems

The phenomenon of clustering in living matter is ubiquitous and is not well understood due to
its inherent complexity [38â€”40,73]. It can be viewed as a non-equilibrium hierarchical assembly,
where at each scale, self-driven components come together by consuming energy in order to
form increasingly complex structures [73]. The examples include bacterial turbulence [74,75] and
fish schooling in the ocean [76]. It was shown that there exists a trade-off between grouping
(clustering) and the optimizing of the energetic efficiency of individual locomotion for swimming
fishes [76].

The complexity of biological clusters arises from the fact that they are built from active
(self-propelling) matter (bacteria, nematodes, fishes, etc.). Even the pair interactions between self-
propelled swimmers become complicated, due to the fact that the pair dynamics depends on
the Reynolds number and time [73]. Moreover, the scaling arguments and the estimation of the
relevant dimensionless numbers (such as Re) become subtle. Even if the individual swimmer is
small (say microscopic), when a cluster of such swimmers is considered, the relevant length scale
used to calculate Re may be that of the collective rather than the individual swimmer [73]. It is
noteworthy that swimming bacteria sometimes demonstrate the turbulent dynamics in a system
which is nominally in the regime of Stokes flow (Re <1) [77]. Establishment of the nature of
coupling (strong/weak) as well as the calculation of the clustering coefficient for the clusters built
of living entities becomes an extremely challenging task.
