N. In the easternmost part of the Atlantic, they extend northwards beyond the
60th degree of latitude. These facts will give an idea of the great extent of the area
in which larvee of our European eel occur. The starting-point for the trans-oceanic migration of the larvee is the area encircled
by the heavily-drawn line in the chart fig. 4. If the annual production of eel larvee
only occupied a very brief period, say 1 month, and provided that all individuals came
from the same spot and made equal progress, alike in their growth and in their move-
ment eastwards, then it would be an easy matter to indicate the position of each
particular stage of development in the ocean by curves representing the average
lengths of the specimens.
