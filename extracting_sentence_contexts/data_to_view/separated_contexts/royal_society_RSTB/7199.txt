Moreover, the spectrum produced by
the latter slopes downwards to the left, because the fixation axis lies in the visual field
below and to the left of the optic axis, so that the slope of the spectrum corresponds
8 roughly with the slope of the fixation points. Now it might be expected that, with similar slopes and colours in similar order, the
positions of the colours would also be similar: red rays falling on the red fixation spot,
> orange falling on the orange fixation spot, yellow on yellow, green on green, etc. But in
fact, the precise opposite is the case, for whereas the fixation spot for red rays is down and
to the left of that for green rays, in the visual field, the red rays are situated up and to the
right of the green ones, in the visual field, in the spectrum produced by chromatic difference
of magnification. This lack of correspondence is not as important as would appear at first sight, for whereas
the fixation points for red rays and blue-green rays, in the case of the authorâ€™s left eye,
differ in position by nearly 10 cone units, the same rays when they fall on the retina differ
in position by less than 1 cone unit. No theoretical reason can at present be given to explain why these fixation points fall
along straight lines.
