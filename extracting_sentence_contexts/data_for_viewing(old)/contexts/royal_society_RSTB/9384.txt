might actually benefit from the fact that ICMS-induced neur-
onal activation does not seem to propagate normally through
hierarchical networks of neurons. Indeed, activation of pri-
mary visual cortex by ICMS does not evoke excitatory
activation in secondary visual cortex in the same way that
natural afferent input does [48]. It may then be that ICMS
of area 3b will only minimally interfere with ICMS of areas
1 and beyond. The power of this approach is that it exploits
the processing that takes place in upstream circuits and cul-
minates in explicit representations of behaviourally relevant
stimulus features. Of course, this feature-based tiling of arti-
ficial touch faces significant technological challenges, some
of which are discussed briefly below.
