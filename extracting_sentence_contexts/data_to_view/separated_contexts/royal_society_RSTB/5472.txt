From the weight of the barium salts of the volatile acids, their titration value,
and their carbon content, it is possible to obtain an approximate idea as to their
composition. (3d) Carbon as non-volatile acids.â€”The problem of the separation of the non-volatile
acids proved to be difficult of solution. A reasonably satisfactory method was
obtained, however, by taking advantage of the fact that, while the calcium salts of the
volatile acids are relatively soluble in alcohol, those of the non-volatile acids are
practically insoluble. The experimental basis for this was obtained by determining
the solubilities in 80 per cent. alcohol of the calcium salts of a number of acids likely
to be met with in fermentation processes.
