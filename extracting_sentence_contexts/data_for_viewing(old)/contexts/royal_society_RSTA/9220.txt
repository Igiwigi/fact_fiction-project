and thus if these values be substituted in 8, as given above, we reach
B; (B.+ 3)? (88.—98,—12) = (48,—38,) (108,—128,—18)*

the equation to the biquadratic, proving that the point associated with the above
frequency curve lies on the biquadratic.

Again 1—m will always be positive, or m less than unity. For the upper branch
of the loop of the biquadratic lies below its asymptote, or 88,—96,—123 = 0, and
accordingly below the line 88,—98,-12 = 0; thus the numerator of 1—m is always
positive. So also is the denominator, for the upper branch always lies above the line
28,—36,—6 = 0.*

* In fact the R-line (58 -68,—9 = 0) the parallel to the asymptote (8) - 9) - 12 = 0), the limiting
frequency line (f,—,-—1 = 0), and the Type III. line (28;-38-—6 = 0) meet in the point By = -
f, = —4 of the negative quadrant and the upper branch of the loop lies in the angle between the first two
and in the positive quadrant,

As m is positive and less than unity the area and moments of the curve are all real
and finite. When the point (8, 8,) moves along the loop of the biquadratic towards
the R-point (8, = 1'8, 8, = 0), the value of 1—m becomes more and more nearly
