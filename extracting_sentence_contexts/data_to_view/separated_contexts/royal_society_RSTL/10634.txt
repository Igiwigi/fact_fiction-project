When an iridium point, as the negative electrode, is partially immersed in water
all the short lines are increased in length, 80 thab they stretch four-fifths of the
distance towards the copper ; if the copper be negative and immersed in water the
copper lines are lengthened, and but few of those belonging to iridium are discernible. The same lengthening of short lines takes place when gold electrodes are moistened. We have but few facts which serve to indicate the constitution of the electric spark
and the cireumstances under which it is altered in character. It may, however, be
affirmed, with some degree of truth, that an increased intensity of the spark, such as
is gained by placing a jar in circuit, which is usually considered to correspond to an
increase of temperature, causes an increased length in the short lines, and also that
the more volatile the metal the longer the lines. It was considered necessary to
ascertain the effect of heating the electrodes, and accordingly two points of iridium wire
were taken as suitable, When the spark passed ab the ordinary temperature, a photo-
graph which received five minutes' exposure showed, beside the large number of short
lines, a continuous band of rays extending through the whole spectrum.
