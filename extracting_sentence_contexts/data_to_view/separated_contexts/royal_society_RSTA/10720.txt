Pierre and its Vicinity. We visited St. Pierre in the beginning of July, 1902, and are able to confirm
from our own observations the majority of the facts already described by Mr. Hrx1,
Professor Russet, and the French Commissioners. Before we arrived much time
had elapsed, and the eruptions of May 20th, 28th, and June 6th had added their quota
to the sum of destruction, Moreover, the city had for 36 hours after the first eruption
been the scene of a gigantic conflagration.
