example, the (inverse) fine structure constant a7! is about 137.036, and is known

1eoretically to be 4m epfic/e?. With laser methods, it has been measured in
rydrogen spectroscopy to some seven parts in 10!°. Similarly, experiments have
yielded the Rydberg spectroscopic constant Ry =a?m,.c/2h (approx. 10.973 x
10° m~') to within 7 parts in 10!?! These and many more considerations regarding

1e merger of slightly divergent data, with differing uncertainties, into a coherent
set of ‘best values’ form a fascinating art, and the interested reader is referred to

1e recent CODATA reports [9].

I now turn to the fact that the BIPM and metrology community has experience

iat is relevant to the question of ‘when should we undertake the redefinition
of the kg by means of the fixing of Planck’s constant?’ (This change would
almost surely also include rationalization of the electrical units.) Let me state
my conclusion early so that the reader does not spend energy in checking this
author for possible bias. This is the right path, but we must wait a bit until
the time to change is right, which I suppose may not be until a half-dozen years
from now. Or perhaps, at the 2015 CGPM meeting? So let us turn to the reasons
behind this opinion.

First of all, we need a convenient way to have a secondary representation of the
kg in any laboratory. The basic requirement before a redefinition occurs is that
