with 10 per cent. of nickel made by them in 1820, in imitation of the Siberian meteoric
iron of Krasnojarsk, in which CarLpREN found as a mean of three analysis 8:96 per cent,*
of nickel, was compared, as regards its powers of undergoing oxidation, with pure iron.
And the authors say : © The colour, when polished, had a yellow tinge. A piece of
the alloy has been exposed to moist air for a considerable time together with a piece of
pure iron ; they are both a little rusty, not, however, to the game extent, that with
the nickel being but slightly acted upon comparatively to the action on the pure iron ;
it thus appears that nickel, when combined with iron, has some effect in preventing
oxidation, though certainly not to the extent that has at times been attributed to it.
It is a curious fact that the game quantity of the nickel alloyed with steel instead of
preventing its rusting appeared to accelerate it very rapidly.” |

IV. Troilite of the Cranbourne siderite.

The Brvor meteorite contains many nodules of troilite lying here and there amongst
the plates and erystals of nickel-iron, always in rounded masses, only very occasionally
an ill-detined cleavage plane being met with. They vary in s8ize from half an inch to
more than two inches in length, are usually covered with a thin layer of graphite,
sometimes with some daubreelite surrounding them ; and one nodule, consisting of
graphite, was found to enclose troilite which had aggregated inside the graphite in a
curious way, 80 that the section of the nodule suggested the outline of a holly leaf.
Plate 53, fig. 2, represents a section of the nodule of graphite, the shaded enclosed
