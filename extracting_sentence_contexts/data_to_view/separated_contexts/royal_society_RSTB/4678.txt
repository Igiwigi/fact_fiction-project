Applying the argument set
out above, one concludes that the majority of the vertebre of this shark, in having
no calcification, are more degenerate than these few caudal vertebre ; and the
conclusion is strengthened by the fact that in another species of the genus,
Somniosus rostratus, the vertebrie are as typically Squaline as those of Seymnorhinus,
there being well calcified double cones throughout the vertebral column. This case naturally leads on to that of Heptanchus, in which the vertebrae of the
middle part of the caudal fin have double cones and radiating secondary lamellz, but
as one passes forwards these gradually dwindle. The fact that the structure of the
caudal vertebree is more complex and more perfect than that of the trunk vertebree
does not tell against the argument; the conclusion to be drawn is that the trunk
vertebree are more advanced, along a line of degeneration, than the caudal (see p. 349). Pursuing the argument further, one would say that the vertebral column of
Hexanchus is still more degenerate, for not only the trunk vertebra, but the caudal
vertebrae as well have no calcified structures. It is argued elsewhere (pp.
