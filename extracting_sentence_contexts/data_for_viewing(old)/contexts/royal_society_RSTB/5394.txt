Apart from the gradual lgss of the sheath of periderm and its replacement by a typical
epidermis, reference to which has already been made, no further change takes place in
the more superficial tissues of the petiole. In the bundle itself, however, there is a
progressive increase in the prominence of the antennex, so that when fully developed the
resemblance of the bundle to a double anchor (which has given the genus its name) is
quite evident (Plate 9, fig. 26). It would be more apt, perhaps, to compare the
appearance of the bundle in the median region of the petiole to a double pick-axe
head rather than to an anchor, in the case of Ankyropteris corrugata, since the inward
flexure of the antennse towards the sagittal plane is relatively slight compared with
that of A. westphaliensis. The latter species also differs in the much greater abaxial
curvature of the central bar, this in our species being relatively slight. Both
species resemble one another, however, in the fact that the abaxial antenne are
invariably shorter than the adaxial ones.

There appear to be two extreme varieties of petiolar strand, one of which has a
relatively stout central bar with an abaxial curvature which is extremely slight (Plate 9,
fig. 26) and with rather stumpy antennz, whilst the other has a slenderer, more curved
central bar, with sometimes longer more strongly flexed antenne (44, fig. 8). It is
possible that these variants may represent two closely related species, but in view of
the large number of petioles of intermediate character which link the two extremes,
this does not seem likely.

The strands also vary considerably in size, the central bar in some cases consisting
of as many as from 36 to 40 tracheids in transverse section, whilst in others it may
