In consequence of this arrangement, it is obvious, as Russowt pointed out, that
the greatest number of threads can be seen in tangential sections of the cortex.

The cork and cork cambium are situated at the exterior of the cortex. The
tangential walls of the cork cambium, which are fairly thick and mucilaginous, swell
with great ease and are pierced by numerous long curved threads, which latter stretch
without a break right across the middle lamella from cell to cell (fig. 23, Plate 33),
though easily broken up into granules if the wall is over-swollen.

The older walls in this region show a tendency to an arrangement of the threads
in shallow pits (fig. 23 (a) ). The change in direction of the threads in this cork
cambium when compared with the rest of the cortex is very marked, and the radial
arrangement is obviously due to the fact that the cells which have become meri-
stemmatic have originated by tangential division.

The radial threads are here persistent, and appear to be of value in conveying food
material and water to the developing cork, On the radial walls of the cork cambium

* It is possible that a somewhat analogous arrangement may also exist in the xylem.
