The view put forward originally by Srarsmunp (1871), and adopted by His (1880)
and many other obstetricians and embryologists, that the degenerative stage of
menstruation is of the nature of an undoing of a preparation (represented by the
previous growth stage) for a fertilized ovum which is not there, necessitates the
assumption that ovulation precedes the degeneration stage of menstruation. We
have seen that menstruation in the Primates is the physiological homologue of the
procestrum in the lower Mammalia, and that ovulation in the Bitch takes place during
cestrus or after the occurrence (or at any rate the commencement) of internal
bleeding. Consequently Statsmunv’s theory becomes untenable. This difficulty
in the way of the theory that “women menstruate because they do not conceive,”
as Powers expressed it, is alluded to in the memoirs on the cestrous cycle in the
Sheep and Ferret (MArsHALL, 1903, 1904), but with these animals the matter is
somewhat complicated by the facts that with the former it is not clear whether
ovulation does not sometimes occur during the procestrum, and with the latter it
may require the additional stimulus of coition before it can be induced.t

* The Pfliiger-Strassmann theory, although it does not assume that ovulation must necessarily occur
before menstruation or “ heat” can be induced, presumably requires us to infer that ripe (or nearly ripe)
follicles are present in the ovary at the commencement of each menstrual or “ heat” period, and that the
latter can only occur when the follicles reach a stage nearly approaching maturity and consequently acquire
a definite degree of protrusion.

+ Rerrerer (1892), has suggested a similar theory to account for the congestion during the Bitch’s
procestrum which he appears to regard as comparable to the albuminous secretion in the oviduct of a Fowl.
