and the moistened finger, and then lift the upper plate of the instrument by its
insulating handle, and the slips of gold leaf will be found to diverge. Taking
for granted the truth of the experiment, the conclusion which VouLra deduced
from it by no means follows as a legitimate inference. Dr. WorLLasroN has
shown that a galvanic effect is produced Ã¾y dissimilar metals with the moist

air of the atmosphere acting as a chemical agent and an imperfect conductor.
The same fact is proved by the electric column of DzLuc. The plate of zinc
becomes partially oxidized by the oxygen of the atmosphere, electricity is ge-
nerated or set- at liberty, and the film of moist air in contact with the two
metals acts as the fluid conductor in an ordinary yoltaic arrangement. If the
compound plate be coated with electric cement to exclude the chemical action
of the air on the zinc, I will venture to predict that no decided electric effect
will take place. Until the supporters of the electric theory show by direct ex-
periment that electric effect does take place with this modification of the ap-
paratus, we must view the whole of their reasoning as founded on a gratuitous
supposition, Having thus shown that VorLra and his followers haye oyerlooked
what, appears to me to be the very cause of the disturbance of electric equi-
librium in the two metals, I shall now demonstrate that the other. principle
on which the theory is built is equally unfounded. This will appear obvious
