Another remarkable cireumstance connected with the ursine remains, and which has
Qalready been alluded to, is the number of instances in which bones obviously belonging
Bo the skeleton of the same animal were found collected together in one spot.
© Amongst the most remarkable of these collections may be mentioned one which,
Bough not recorded in the © Register,” was found, as we are informed by Mr. PExGELLY,
S+* on the 29th July, 1858, upwards of 2 feet deep in the third bed, immediately north of
She junction of the Reindeer and Flint-knife Galleries, in a small recess in the west wall
Sf the former, and about 62 feet from the entrance, at a spot where the overlying
Stalagmite was about 4 inches thick.” The bones in question, s0 far as they are
:Sxposed, include an entire left femur, the corresponding tibia lying in the natural pos-
:Zure it would assume in extreme flexion of the knee, and having the entire astragalus

ticulated to it in the natural position. Close beside these leg-bones, and in fact

rtly overlapping the astragalus, is the left radius ; and attached to the specimen, when
"at firs came under my notice, was the detached lower articular end of the same radius,
Avith the scapho-lunar fossette entire. In a * Report of Progress in the Brixham Cave”
Blrawn up by Dr. FaLcoxer in Sept. 1858*, this specimen is described as a © superb
Specimen of the bones of left hind leg, comprising the femur, tibia, and fibula folded
Sogether, with the patella and astragalus # 8itu.” © These were found,” the Report
oes on to say, © near the Ebur chasm, and the other parts of the skeleton may be
ooked for when that portion of the cavern is dug up.” And in a note given in p. 495
pt the © Palzeontological Memoirs,” dated May 1863, Dr. FaLcoxer states that © all the
Secircumstances connected with the entire leg of Cave-Bear (femur with tibia and fibula
ay together, and ball of astragalus partly dislocated), and its position in commi-
