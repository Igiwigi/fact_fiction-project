Therefore, we conclude that, regardless
of the exact nature of the contributions to the phase lag discussed above, the mere existence of
a non-opacity-related contribution (the —35 degree component in the distribution) corroborates
the presence of magnetic-like waves (i.e. fast magneto-acoustic mode in the low-f regime, being
clearly distinguishable from the other two components). Our interpretation is also in agreement
with the results of Houston et al. [62], who have found Alfvén/intermediate shocks at the same
spatial locations. In this regard, given the fact that the coherence patches in the wavelet diagrams

can extend for a few periods, we believe that our results may be interpreted as the signature of : =
the magneto-acoustic fast mode that eventually leads to impulsive Alfvénic shocks which are : =
followed by sudden reversals in the Stokes profiles. 1B

Baker et al. [72] have found by using Hinode/EIS observations that the same active region : =
shows the presence of elemental abundance anomalies on the same side of the umbra. As 8
previously mentioned, the detection of magnetic fluctuations associated with MHD waves takes : 4
on a particular importance for the FIP effect [36]. In this regard, the observations combined with De
the Laming fractionation model suggest a possible link between the co-spatial CP perturbations : Ss
and the anomalous abundances. : S

It is worth highlighting that the narrow range of inclination angles of the magnetic field, 1s

corresponding to the locations at which a phase relation between intensity and CP perturbations
are found, suggests a possible role of the magnetic field inclination and geometry.
