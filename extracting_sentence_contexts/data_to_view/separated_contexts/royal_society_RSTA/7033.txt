When a German translation of the book was being prepared,
it was therefore decided to add as an appendix an exposition of some of the recent advances. It fell to me to write this appendix, and the present essay has grown out of it. In fact the greater part of this essay is a translation of the “Anhang’ which is shortly to
appear with Kurosch’s Gruppentheorie (translated by W. Hahn: Akademieverlag Berlin;
a Hungarian translation by A. Gascalyi, also with the appendix, is to be published by
Akadémiai Kiadé Budapest).
