we have not attempted in the large way. In the laboratory,
stee] and gold were combined in various proportions; none of
the results were So promising as the alloys already named,
nor did either tin or copper, as far as we. could judge, at all
improve steel. With titanium we failed, owing to the imper-
fection of crucibles. In one instance, in which the fused

button gave'a fine damask surface, we were disposed to attri-
bute the appearance to the presence of titanium ; but in this
we were 'mistaken; the fact was, we had unintentionally
made wootz. The button, by analysis, gave a little silex and
alumine, but not an atom of titanium ; menachanite, in a par-
ticular tate of preparation, was used : this might possibly
contain the‚Äù earths or their basis, or they may have formed
a part of the crucible.

M. BerTHiER, who first made the alloy of steel and chro-
mium,*'speaks very favourably of it, We have made only
two experiments. 1600 grains of steel, with 16 of pure chrome,
were packed into one of the best crucibles, and placed in an
excellent blast furnace : the metals were fused, and kept in
that state for some time. The fused button proved good and
