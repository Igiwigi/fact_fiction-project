contain bile. It is not intended by the foregoing remarks to give any opinion as to the
method of fat-absorption in the stomach.

The occurrence of lymphoid follicles in the mucosa will be discussed in the next
chapter.

CHAPTER III.
THE MINUTE ANATOMY OF THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE AT THE POINT OF TRANSITION
BETWEEN THE STOMACH AND INTESTINE.

In the following Chapter the anatomical continuity of BruxNER's glands with the
coiled tubes of the stomach will be described. But before proceeding to the relation
of the facts a short account of the history of the subject will be given.

Bzven (104), 1849, spoke of racemose or acinous glands of the pylorus, which pass
into the acinous glands of the duodenum (BruNNER's glands).

EckgR (105), 1852, said that the racemose glands of the portio pylorica form an
obvious transition to BRUNNER's glands.

This fact was either overlooked or denied until

CoBELLI (106), 1864, found, in the pyloric end of the stomach of man, branched
mucous glands and acinous glands. 'The acinous glands are arranged in rows or little
heaps radiating from the pylorus. At the commencement of the intestine the glands
