In consequence of these and other experiments, the statement that the eye is largely,
if not entirely, uncorrected for colour error is well founded. (3) Previous hypotheses

Many hypotheses have been proposed to account for the absence of the effects of
chromatic aberration. (a) That the eye is in fact corrected for colour. () That the mean
refractive index of the eye media resembles that of water, which has a low value. (c) The
rays reaching the eye consist of narrow pencils, which suffer only a small refraction.
