These anomalies were finally traced to the fact that an
incredibly small amount of impurity derived from the stronger gages or vapours
sufficed to disguise and falsify the action of the weaker ones. All this had to be
learnt ; and when learnt, I thought it desirable, for the sake of accuracy, not to
publish the results which had been gained with s0 much labour, but to go once
more, with improved appliances, over the same ground. This I did ; though it
involved the total abandonment of seven weeks' uninterrupted experimental work
in 1859, of seven weeks' similar work in 1860, and of many fragmentary eftorts, On
the 10th of January, 1861, the memoir containing an account. of the investigation was
handed in to the Royal Society.t

The first point of importance established in 1859 and developed in the memoir just
mentioned was that already referred to; namely, the fact of absorption, and large
differences of absorption. The second point—destined, I think, to throw light on the
deeper problems of molecular physics—was the proof that while elementary gases
offered a scarcely sensible impediment to radiant heat, equally transparent compound
gases exhibited, in many cases, an energy of absorption comparable to that of the most
athermanous solids and liquids. Determining, for example, the action of a mechanical
mixture of two elementary gases, it was proved that without altering either the quan-
tity of matter, or its perfect transparency to light, the absorption of invisible heat
might be increased many hundred-fold by the passage of the constituents of the
mixture into a state of chemical combination.
