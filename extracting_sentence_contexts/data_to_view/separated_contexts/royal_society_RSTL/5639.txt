T never
' Fcribed the phenomena, firs observed by myself, to a new force acting upon an ideal line, like the optic
Axis, quite independent of the paramagnetic condition of the mass of the erystal. Convinced, as T was from
She beginning, that there ought to be analogies between the optic and magnetic properties of crystals, T
* ever 80ught the reason for it anywhere else but in the influence of the crystalline structure on both the
iniferous ether and the magnetic induction. Tno more intended to imply a real repulsion or attraction of
© optic axes, than the celebrated French philosopher, when he aid a beam of light in positive erystals was
attracted, in negative ones was repelled, intended to announce a mysterious action emanating in fact from
hese axes. Such expressions are intended to describe a newly observed fact, but not theoretical views. So
Ylso the true meaning of the German words, translated thus, © independent of the paramagnetic or diamag-
Aebic condition of the mass of the crystal,” is only this, © whether the mass of the crystal (tourmaline and
ous spar) be paramagnetic or diamagnetic, the direction of the axis is the same.” If, notwithstanding
Ahese remarks, there should remain any doubt whatever, I can refer to a paper sent to the Haarlem Society,
oomber 1849, before other philosophers, except Professor Farapay, had published anything about the
magnetic induction of crystals.
