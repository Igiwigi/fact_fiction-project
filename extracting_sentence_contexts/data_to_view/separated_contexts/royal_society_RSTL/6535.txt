The behaviour, therefore, of tellurium is intermediate between that of the metal and
that of the metalloid; for, according to Hrrronp®, selenium increases rapidly in conduct-
ing power with the temperature. Graphite and gas-coke f behave in the same manner;
and BECQUERELf, found that gases when heated conduct better than when cold. From
these facts we learn another marked difference in the physical properties of the metals
and metalloids, viz. that the metals tose in conducting power with an increase of tempera-
ture, whereas under the same cireumstances the metalloids gain. In order to be better able to compare the rexults obtained with the pure metals, we
give the following Tables. Table XIV. contains all the formule deduced from the
observations by the method of least squares, with the conducting power of each metal
taken =100 at 0*; Table XV. the mean of the formule found for each metal.
