In this section, we apply the previously described methods to the transverse-field Ising spin
glass Hamiltonian (2.1). Here, we immediately face an issue: the computation of the forward
approximation is obstructed by the fact that the spin glass term Hy = — >; Jijojo, has highly
degenerate energy levels. This gives rise to diverging terms in equation (4.4) when E, = Ej. To
avoid this problem, we add a weak and random longitudinal field term Hong to the Hamiltonian
