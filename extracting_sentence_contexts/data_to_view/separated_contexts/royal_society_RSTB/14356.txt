The intrinsically motivated learning pro-
cess results in the acquisition of representations that are
sensorimotor in nature, are grounded in the environment
(distal reference), and are amenable for offline re-enactment
and use by other cognitive processes (concept formation).

(a) The offline control system: alignment of multi-

sensory representations. In order to align the motor and sen- modal topologies for perception and action

sory spaces, the mappings from the sensory and motor The main role of the offline control system is to select the
modalities to the internal representational space need to be policy that will be executed by the online controller in the
dependent on each other during learning so that they end actual environment [62]. As in TEC, two alternative modes
up being represented in what is in fact the same, common should be distinguished: an exogenous or stimulus-tied
space. Crucially, to obtain such alignment, the motor space mode driven by the environment as well as an endogenous
must be defined at a correct level of abstraction. In particular, goal-driven mode of action selection, defined by reference

the motor space cannot be identified with the space of motor to a self-generated process potentially decoupled by online


interaction in a given context [41].
