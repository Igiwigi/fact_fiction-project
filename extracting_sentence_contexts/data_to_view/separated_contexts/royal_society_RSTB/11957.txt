The
debates about the use of these words as applied to plants
became as heated as scientific debates can be, and perhaps a
little more than that. Human emotions, though ostensibly not
actually running the scientific show, do strongly influence
the debate for sure. The arguments that the phrase ‘plant neu-
robiology’ helped initiate are perfect examples of this fact. Just
to give you a taste of how the discourse is taking place, on the
advocate’s side, there are published papers like ‘The mind of
plants: thinking the unthinkable’ [62] and ‘Plants learn and
remember: let’s get used to it.’ [63]. On the detractor’s side,
there are titles like ‘Plant neurobiology: no brain, no gain?’
[64] as well as the (rather unkind) ‘Plant neurobiology: intelli-
gent plants or stupid studies?’ [65].
