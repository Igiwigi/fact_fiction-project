It may be referred to as Hurycarpus Oweni. â€˜
number of digits is variable in other orders of Reptilia; and therefore the question
must remain open whether Dicynodonts had four or five. If the first metacarpal is present, only its proximal end is exposed in near union
with the radiale : a circular osseous point in advance of it might then indicate its
distal end ; while a somewhat larger circle prolonging the line inward would indicate
the first phalange. These identifications, however, rest upon too shadowy a foundatio
of fact to be evidence that the digit existed. The remaining digits are remarkable for showing a reduced number of phalanges,
There sre, apparently, three in the middle digit on the radial side, but only two in
each of the other digits, as in terrestrial Chelonians. I number the digits 2, 3, 4,5.
