In discussing the origin of the shell matrix itself, FRoBOésE refers to the process as
comparable to the formation of a membrana decidua which involves the degenera-
tion of maternal tissues, from which the keratin-like matrix might easily be derived. It must be stressed, however, that the evidence derived from portions of uterine
wall, which have been removed from contact with a developing egg and fixed more
rapidly than is possible with an entire specimen, is conclusive that the epithelium
never degenerates to the extent of shedding its cells in any conspicuous degree. In
fact, it is difficult to identify even the heavily stained areas of contact in such material. Similarly I have not been able to confirm the distinctly double layered stratification
of the epithelium illustrated on Plate 3, fig. 3, of FRoBésk’s paper. Some account must be taken also of the relative amounts of secretion contributing
to the shell layers.
