Little wonder then that acid intoxication brings abnormal phenomena
in its train. We are in the dark as to whether such a phenomenon as the conduction
of the cardiac impulse down the bundle of His is something propagated from molecule
to molecule, but at least we cannot be surprised that, other things being equal,
the A-V interval should be prolonged by acid; we are in the dark as to whether
the tone of the heart is dependent upon the contiguity of the molecules, but we
cannot be surprised that acid should cause this tone to relax if the number of clumps
decreases and each becomes further removed from its neighbour; we are in the
dark as to whether the acuteness of the mental processes is dependent upon the
correct number of clumps in the nerve cell vibrating at the correct speed, but we
cannot affect surprise if the finer cerebral functions become dulled—as indeed they
do—when the molecules become inert and the number of vibrating aggregates
becomes diminished. We must not, however, push the theory of aggregation too far,
and our last word in this section must be one which distinguishes fact from hypothesis. The determinations stand, whatever construction be put upon them. The curves
given express the properties of hemoglobin in relation to oxygen, and their
physiological significance, as regards respiration, is independent of theory.
