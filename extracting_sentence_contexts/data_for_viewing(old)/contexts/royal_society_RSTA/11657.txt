From the data as to the chemical composition, constitution and density of the
eutectic alloy and its two component phases as arrived at in the earlier parts of this
paper, it is possible to calculate the volume composition of the eutectic alloy. The
eutectic has been found to consist of 55°87 parts of tin and 44°13 parts of B per cent.,
the densities of tin and of the 8 body being 7°30 and 10°38 respectively, while the
density of the eutectic is $40, The volumes of free tin and of the 8 body present in
100 grammes of the eutectic alloy are therefore equal to 55°87/7°30 and 44°13/10°38
respectively ; this gives the volume ratio of the two constituents as 7°653 to 4°252 or
1:80 to 1. An attempt was made to verify this volume relationship by means of
planimetric measurements of the relative areas of the light and dark constituents
of the eutectic as represented in some of the best defined of the photo-micrographs
reproduced in figs. 34, 35 and 36, but the results varied too widely to allow of any
satisfactory deduction. Consideration of the fact that the structure of the eutectic as
shown in these photographs frequently assumes the form of plates or rods of one
constituent embedded in the other at once serves to explain these variations ; in the
case of a bunch of parallel needles of the 8 body lying in a matrix of tin, the relative
areas of the cross-sections as seen in a micrograph would depend upon whether the
plane of the section ran parallel to or at right angles to the length of the needles.
These variations are, of course, further accentuated by the fact that the eutectic
structure is always somewhat minute, so that the areas measured at any one time are
confined to a very minute portion of the actual alloy.

Examples of the typical micro-structure of the lead-tin eutectic alloy are given in
figs. 81 to 36 inclusive (Plate 8), all of which have been taken from samples of
pure eutectic prepared in the manner described above. Fig. 31 (magnification 600
