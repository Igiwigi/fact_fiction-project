The odontoblast layer (c) is in immediate contact with the above-described semi-
calcified layer (b) and the cells composing it lie square to the forming dentine. In
thin sections the odontoblasts form a single layer only, and in young teeth there is a
distinct space between them. (Plate 36, fig. 2.) Dr. L. A. Wem (‘Zur Histologie
der Zahnpulpa’) describes as a separate layer, a comparatively clear space existing
between the odontoblasts and the general mass of the pulp tissue (Plate 36, fig. 1, @),
in which there are no cells, but interlacing fine fibres, which he describes as being in
connection with the odontoblast cells. This layer takes the stain very faintly, or
not at all, generally appearing with low powers as a clear zone immediately beneath
the odontoblasts.

I can certainly corroborate the fact of the constancy of this appearance in the
transverse sections of teeth I have examined, although not agreeing with Dr. WeIL
as to the ultimate destination of all these fibres. In some longitudinal sections,
however, taken near to the growing and unfinished end of a bicuspid tooth, I have
been unable to distinguish any such layer, the cells and fibres of the general
pulp tissue being in immediate proximity to the odontoblasts. In transverse
sections near the apex of the pulp (where the growth of the dentine is not very
active) I have seen the layer much more marked than in other parts. Dr. Wet
