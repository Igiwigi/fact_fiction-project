is directed obliquely backward from its ganglion to its exit, whereas in ordinary Teleostei
it passes directly downward ; I speak here of course in reference to the position which
these animals habitually assume. The commissura ansulata consists of the game two
divisions as in AM. cephalus, bub the parts which it connects are slightly different.
It derives its lateral fibres from the base of the wings to which it acts as a commissure ;
the upper part of its decussating bundles, instead of going to the torus semicireularis
as in 1. cephalus, goes into and is lost in the granular layer of the anterior end of
the cerebellum. Upon further consideration I find that the homology which I gave
for this commissure in the brain of 1. cephalus was most probably wrong, and the fact
that some of its fibres in this animal are derived from the cerebellum seems to confirm
its determination, as the pons varolii, which was also adopted by Frvscn.*

The posterior commissure (fig. 3) occupies its usual position behind the third ventricle
and the infundibulum, but here it is more isolated, for the posterior wall of the infundi-
bulum appears to be wanting, 80 that the fissure in the floor of the aqueduct of Sylvius
communicates with it without any partition ; it forms a communication between regions
corresponding to those united by this commissure in MM. cephalus.

The anterior end of the dorsal commissure of the tecta (figs. 2 and 3) is all that
remains of that commissure which in Teleostei generally extends for the whole length
of those bodies. This is placed immediately above the posterior commissure and even
