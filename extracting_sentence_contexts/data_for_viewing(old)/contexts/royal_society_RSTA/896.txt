A graph state is also a stabilizer state [18]. The generators of the stabilizer group of |G) can be
written as

In fact, any stabilizer state can be made into some graph state by only performing single-qubit
Clifford operations [9]. If two states, |y) and |#) are related by some sequence of single-qubit
Clifford operations, we denote this by |) ~Lc |¢). Given a stabilizer state |S), one can find a graph
state |G) such that |S) y ~ic |G)y, by simply performing Gaussian elimination followed by certain
operations on the columns of a matrix which rows are the symplectic form of the generators
of S [18].

To study what graph states can be reached from a given graph state, we introduce the notion
of a qubit-minor as defined in definition 1.1. It turns out that the question of whether |G’) is a
qubit-minor of |G) is equivalent to whether G’ is a vertex-minor of G, as we describe below.
