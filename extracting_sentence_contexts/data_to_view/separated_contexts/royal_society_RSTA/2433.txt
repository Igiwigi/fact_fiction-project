Instead of maximizing h(Y), we make the following observation: In the extreme
case of zero noise, Y and X have the same distribution. Therefore, one expects that, if noise is :
relatively small compared to the received signal, then Y has a distribution that is ‘similar’ to that :3
of X. In fact, the signal-to-noise ratio in VLC channels can often be high, making this observation :
practically relevant. This means that, in this regime, a ‘good’ choice of fx is one that maximizes :s
h(X). PD

To find the maximum h(X), one can use the maximum-entropy theorem [16, theorem 12.1.1]. : 8
For a random variable X € [0, A] with Ex[X] <E and E > (A/2), the maximum h(X) is achieved when [=
X is uniformly distributed, i.e. ia

If E < A/2, then h(X) is maximized when X follows the truncated-exponential distribution
