Tf the dry air entered at the
end of the tube nearest to the source of heat, on the firs: and second admissions, and
sometimes even on a third, the yapour carried from the warm end to the cold end of the
tube was precipitated as a mist upon the latter, for a distance sometimes of nearly a foot. The mist always disappeared on pumping out. It is needless to remark that facts of this
character, of which I could cite many, were not calculated to promote incautiousness or
rashness on my part. I say very clearly how easy it was to fall into the gravest errors,
and I took due precautions to prevent myself from doing 80. Knowing that a solution of salt was almost as opake to radiant heat as water itself,
I was careful to examine whether the effects which I had observed with aqueous vapour
might not be due to the precipitation of the vapour on the surfaces of the plates of
