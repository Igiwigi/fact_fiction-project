69) show that laterally thess
arches join a cartilaginous tube, embracing the intervertebral regions of the notochord,
and continuous from one vertebra to the next. It will be convenient to treat separately the neural arches, the hemal arches with
their appendages, and the intervertebral cartilaginous rings. The neural arches, except in the fact of embracing a relatively smaller part of the
neural tube than in the earlier stage, do not at first sight appear to have undergone any
changes. Viewed from the side, however, in dissected specimens, they are seen to be
prolonged upwards 80 as to unite above with bars of cartilage directed obliquely back-
wards. An explanation of this appearance is easily found in the sections.
