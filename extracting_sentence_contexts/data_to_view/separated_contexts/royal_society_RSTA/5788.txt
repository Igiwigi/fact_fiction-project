Equation (4.35) can be recognized as the
CL equation [3,4,28] with the solenoidal Stokes velocity us, replacing u°. This is not surprising
since the O(e?,) difference between us, and u® is of the same order as terms neglected in the
derivation of the CL equation. (CL geared 1 to by taking js = €”. In our derivation, this gearing
is not necessary.) In fact the assumption 1 <1 is only used to neglect the term (4.30) from the
Lagrangian-mean momentum equation to obtain (4.31) and hence (4.35). Restoring this term leads
to the generalization

(81 + Lyp)(w® » dx + 4d (O¢1qyI2) + 4(f x x) » dx) =—da", (4.36)

of the CL equation valid for 4 = O(1). Since Lub and d commute, L,.4(011q;) = d(---) and the
additional terms involving |q,|7 can be absorbed in the differential of the pressure-like term on
the right-hand side.
