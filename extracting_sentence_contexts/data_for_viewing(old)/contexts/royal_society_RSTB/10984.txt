et al. [9] have reported a decrease in the expression of the qNs quantifies the stage of photoinhibition caused by the
genes coding the enzymes of the Chl biosynthetic pathway high light exposure. The last component, qNf, seems to reflect
and an increase of the expression of the genes coding fast conformational changes within thylakoid membranes in
enzymes involved in ROS detoxication. The expression of the vicinity of the photosystem II complexes. For the control
cGAPDH has been linked to stress conditions (temperature: cells, only qNf increased significantly, suggesting that under

[48], heavy metals: [49]). The higher expression observed this light intensity, the need for a mechanism of light energy


dissipation is weak. Compared with ML conditions, both qNi
and qNs have significantly increased whereas qNf remained
unchanged (see electronic supplementary material, table
SD5.3). This result fits well with the fact that under ML
photon flux density, the expression of the genes coding the
proteins of the PSII reaction centre (psbA: D1, and psbD:
D2) and those catabolizing the photodamaged PSII reaction
center (FTSH1 and FTSH2) remain stable [9]. The gene psbD
codes the photosystem II reaction centre D2 protein, one of
the proteins with the highest turnover rate under stress con-
ditions [54]. Because qNs is linked to photoinhibition, the
significant increase in this parameter suggests that the
excess of light energy activates both the xanthophyll cycle
and_ photoinhibition. A higher level of photoinhibition
would explain the reduced growth rate of the cultures
transferred to HL when compared with ML (figure 1).
