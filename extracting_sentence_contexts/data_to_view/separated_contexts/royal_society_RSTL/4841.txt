The spermatozoa of the Newts, as is well known,
are of large 8ize, and are easily recognized ; 80 that in the eyent of their having pene-
trated the egg-covering before it, leaves the duct, or at the moment of its expansion,
or after the chamber has been formed in it, they can hardly escape observation.

216 MR, NEWPORT ON THE IMPREGNATION OF

I preserved this egg confined to one spot in a minute glass capsule, and in exactly
the same position beneath the microscope, for forty-eight hours. During the first
three quarters of an hour many of the spermatozoa on its surface exhibited as vivid
motions as at first, but still adhered to the same parts, and had not, so far as I could
perceive, changed their posture or their place in the least, or had penetrated in the
slightest degree into the envelope. At the end of twelye hours I found that the yelk
had undergone the usual process of cleavage, which, at that time, had already been
advanced to the stage of coarse granulation of the surface, a fact which proved most
distinetly that this egg had been impregnated. Spermatozoa were still distinetly
recognized over the whole surface of the envelope, but their motions had now ceased. On the following morning, May 20th, the changes were found to have proceeded un-
interruptedly, as the yelk was then finely granulated over its whole snrface.
