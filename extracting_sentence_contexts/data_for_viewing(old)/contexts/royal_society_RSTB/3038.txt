periodically discharged. It were easy to suggest that the by-product being blue,
might, if it were discharged during the day, interfere with the protective resemblance
in the production of which Hippolyte seems so adept, and to trace its nocturnal
removal and the whole phenomenon of periodicity in Hippolyte to this. But this
would be to assume the very thing that a protectionist should be asked to prove and
which, for our part, we regard as not yet proven, that the whole duty of pigment is

protective. Moreover, as a matter of fact, the superficial network of red or red and
yellow, effectually screens any deeper lying colour from view. It is at least as possible
that the chromatophore-centres are the seat of changes which result not only in
pigment-production but also in its destruction and the consequent manufacture of
other substances whose importance, for all we know, may rival that of the pigments
themselves. Night after night, every chromatophore-centre in the skin, the muscle,
about the gut and liver, discharges its quota of blue substance. Yet there is no
accumulation of blue pigment in the body. Therefore it must undergo destruction
or at least change. â€˜Till we know the nature of this change we must hesitate before
giving judgment as to which function of the chromatophore is the more important,
the production of pigments giving rise to appearances of a protective nature, or that
of the blue substance which is given over to metabolic processes of the body.
