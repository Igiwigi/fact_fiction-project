tion of ainda. as also appears to have been the case at Pouk Hill, near Walsall.

T have, unfortunately, not discovered any examples of the other type of petrifaction
which is only known, as far as South Staffordshire is concerned, in the case of
Cordaites Brandlingi (With.){ This no doubt was a petrifaction of the isolated
log type, and was derived from Rowléy Regis ; but the exact locality and horizon are
unfortunately not recorded.

Impressions in Clay-ironstone Nodules.—Speaking generally, plant remains are not
well distributed in the ironstones of South Staffordshire. A few examples are known
from the Gubbin ironstones, between the Heathen and Thick coals, and from some
others; but, with the exception of the Coseley ironstones, they appear to be decidedly
rare. The fact that very few ironstones are to-day worked in this coalfield may,
however, account in part for this seeming poverty.

On the other hand, the Ten-foot Ironstones, above the Thick Coal at Claycroft,
near Coseley, have furnished one of the most remarkable plant assemblages known
from the Coal Measures. These specimens occur there in extraordinary abundance,
and during the many years when these beds were mined as an open work, the
supply of nodules was unlimited. They can still be collected to-day, though with
increasing difficulty, since the workings have long since been abandoned. Abundant
examples from this locality are to be seen in every collection in South Staffordshire,
and in most museums in England. Collections numbering many thousands of
specimens have been formed by numerous collectors during the last half-century,
some of which still remain in private hands.
