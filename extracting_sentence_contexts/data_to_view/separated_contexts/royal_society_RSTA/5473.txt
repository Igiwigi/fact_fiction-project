In figures 3 and 4, we report only the error bars to identify the width of the transition region;
otherwise, there would be the superposition of shaded regions for different values of membrane
viscosity Jim.

3. Results

To study the dependency of the TB-TT transition on the viscosity ratio A (see equation (2.10)),
the capillary number Ca (see equation (2.4)), and the membrane viscosity 4m, we performed 3D
numerical simulations to generate four different phase diagrams (A,Ca), each one related to a
value of membrane viscosity 4m in the range [0,3.18] x 10-7 mPas. The use of such range is
motivated by the fact that the value of j4m is not known precisely; rather, various experimental
measurements reported 44m in the range between 10-7 mPas and 10-° mPas (see [15,27] for
