fibres from their origin in Meissnrr’s plexus into the smooth muscle of the villi (fig. 28,
Plate 33).

(2) Sensory Endings.

Ranson (55) states that ‘‘ in spite of the negative character of the histological evidence
the existence of sensory fibres in the gastro-intestinal mucosa has been assumed by
most physiologists. And indeed receptive endings in the epithelium seem to be required
by the fact that responses may be obtained from both chemical and mechanical stimula-
tion of the mucosa. The acid control of the cardia and pylorus (W. B. Cannon (12) ),
the inhibition of hunger contractions by introduction of various fluids into the’ stomach
(A. J. Carson (15) ), variations in the rate of passage of different kinds of food along
the intestinal tract (W. B. Cannon (12) ), and other phenomena, indicate the presence
of chemical sensibility in the gastro-intestinal mucosa.”

In 1899 Doarer (25) described a complete reflex arc in the intestinal plexuses, the
sensory component being a nerve-cell, situated in an enteric ganglion, whose dendrites
terminated in the mucosa. About the same time Saxusserr (58), working with Doce,
claimed to have traced, in the gut of fishes, fibres from the intestinal plexuses into the
mucosa, According to RANson’s account of Saxusserr’s work, “ these [fibres] ramified
beneath the epithelium and sent fine varicose threads into the columnar epithelium,
