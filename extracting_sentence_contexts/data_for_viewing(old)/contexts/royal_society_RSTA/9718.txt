+ In passing from copper to germanium the extreme variation in atomic diameter is from 2-67A to 2-44 A.
In the A group elements of the same period the atomic diameters from potassium to titanium vary from

4-54 A to 2-90 A.

the solidus lines and solid solubility limits also obey simple valency laws where deviations
related to atomic diameters are clearly shown.

The fact that in the binary alloys, in which the solvent and solute are in different
periods, the freezing point curves in dilute solutions give depressions corresponding to
“ liquidus factors,” which are whole numbers, suggests that we have again to deal with
some kind of electronic quantum relation, and we again suggest that the deviations in
more concentrated solutions are the result of the atomic factor. Reference to fig. 7
will show that these deviations may be in either direction from the standard equivalent
composition curve, and we suggest that this characteristic of the solute atom is retained
in ternary or more complex alloys provided that no mutual interaction takes place
between the different solute atoms.

Suppose a given ternary or more complex alloy has a total adjusted equivalent
composition , and that there is « atomic °%/, of one particular solute element A whose
liquidus factor is a. If the alloy were a simple binary alloy of copper with A, our
