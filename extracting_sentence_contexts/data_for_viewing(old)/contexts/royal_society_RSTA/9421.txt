Fig. 22.

the upper wavy curve formed by adding together the curves of the separate atoms.
The distance from crest to crest is what we have called d, the spacing.
Suppose this curve were known and a harmonic analysis made of it. We should
obtain a series of harmonic terms having periods d, d/2, d/3, ....

Let the curve in fig. 23 represent one of these terms, in fact, the second. The
existence of this term implies that the medium, so far as regards the reflection
of a wave in the second order, may be looked on as a harmonic
medium of amplitude AA’, The rise and fall of the curve above
the line AB implies that the medium has a certain distribution
of density which will give a second order spectrum if the rays
fall on the medium at the proper inclination to the planes. The
area ABCD represents the mass of one atom (there being one
atom to each spacing); and of the whole, the portion A’B/CD is
ineffective so far as this reflection is concerned. The ratio of
AA’ to AD represents thé fraction of the atom which is effective. Now the X-rays,
however they strike the medium, always traverse the same number of atoms. The
ratio of AA’ to AD therefore represents that portion of the medium which is effective
