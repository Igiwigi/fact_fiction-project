Tq = dt Ntotal/Naecay: Finally, from Ndecay simulations that terminate at hg,, we have P(hg,) =
Neecay/Ntotal, since there are Ngecay out of Niotal sample points with F; <hg,. In practice, we
construct P(hg,) from AMS simulations via (4.2) with a sampling time ét = 1.

The remainder of (4.3) consists of multiplying and dividing by P(io) and then applying the
previous observations about figure 9c to decompose (4.3) into a factor [Ty, that depends only
weakly on Re, and 1/P(h), that depends strongly on Re. Furthermore, we approximate P(g) by
the Fisher-Tippett distribution evaluated at hg. The Re-dependence of fy ~ 1/P(hg) is contained in
the Re-dependence of the parameters jz, 0 and &. We return to this after discussing the splitting
case.

In almost all respects the splitting analysis is the same as that of the decay case. The only
important differences comes from the fact that the score function ¢ for splitting (3.2) is not the
turbulence fraction F;. However, ¢ and F; are closely related, both in terms of expression (3.2)
and in terms of the values they take during band splitting in figure 6b. A split is deemed to have
occurred when ¢(u(f)) reaches hg, from below. Hence, analogously with (4.3), the time scale for


splits is related to the survival function of ¢ evaluated at hg,:

where S¢ is the survival function for ¢. While one could analyse distributions of the score function
¢, the turbulence fraction is ubiquitous in this field and the distributions in figures 8 and 9b
are of general interest. Hence it is preferable to work with these distributions, even though it
