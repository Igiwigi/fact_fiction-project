The differences in the septal structure of the Paleozoic Zaphrentids and Cyatho-
phyllids would seem to indicate a simpler development of the mesenterial muscles
in the former. Certainly these differences have not become less in the younger

families descended from these, and the anatomy of the typical Turbinolid and a
typical Astrecid gives full evidence of the fact that the simpler septal structure
answers to a less pleated, less highly differentiated condition of the muscular
thickening of the mesenteries. It is in the same three families, viz., the Cyathophyllide, Astreide, and Fungide,
that the compound trabecula reaches its highest and most varied development, and
that the granulations of the septum in consequence are most elaborate. Many of the
forms have been described above (figs.
