second or any higher order, or more than a single contact with the same given curve.

23. The equation of the conic has been in all that precedes considered as containing
the six parameters (a, b, c, f, 9g, k); but if the question as originally stated relates
only to a class of conics the equation whereof contains linearly 2, 3, 4, or 5 parameters,
or if, reducing the equation by means of any of the given conditions, it can be brought to
the form in question, then in the latter case we may employ the equation in such re-

duced form, attending only to the remaining conditions ; and in either case we have the
3, 4, or 5 parameters, which parameters are
or 4-dimensional space, and the discussion
