If there are N units in the material, and a fraction / of the whole range of the distribution
is sampled, the variance of the number n falling in the sampled parts of the range will be
made up of two parts, that due to the sampling variance of the total ‘normal’ probability
P attributable to the sampled part of the range, and that due to the divergence of the actual
density within the sampled part of the range from the ‘normal’ density. This latter will be
given by a binomial distribution. We shall in fact have

V(n) = N2V(P)+P(1—P) N.

The expectation of P is f, and its variance for the various methods of sampling is given in
percentage terms by the results already obtained. If N = 1000 and f= 7, for example,
taking mean value, we have
P(i—P)N= 90-0
Systematic sample at spacing o == 0:0)
N?V(P) }Random sample, 1 from each block of ¢ = 111-9
Random sample, 2 from each block of 27 = 390-6

Thus in this case the use of a systematic sample, instead of a random sample with one
point located in each block of ¢, about halves the variance of the estimate of the total number
of units in the distribution. A random sample of two points from each block of 2¢ will have
about five times the variance of the systematic sample.
