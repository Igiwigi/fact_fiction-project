Phyllosperms (with leaf-borne seeds) and Stachyosperms (with stem-borne seeds),
respectively, appears to be very old, for, as far as I am aware, there is among the
Pteridosperms no sign of a transition from the phyllospermic to the stachyospermic
condition : a sharp differentiation is seen as far back as the available fossil records
can take us. There could scarcely be a greater contrast in this respect than there is
between RenAvutt’s well-known figure of Cordaianthus Williamsoni (see Scorr, 1909,
p. 540) and the equally familiar figure of Lyginopteris Oldhamia, which forms the
frontispiece of Dr. Scort’s ‘ Studies.’

Combined with this fact there are other important features, in which, as Dr. Scorr
points out (1909, p. 650), the Cordaiteze and the fern-like seed-plants are as far apart
as two groups of Gymnosperms very well can be. The strap-shaped parallel-veined
leaves of Cordaites, and in fact the leaves of any known Stachyosperm, living or
fossil, are entirely different from the much-divided fern-like fronds of the Pterido-
sperms or the almost équally complex leaves of the Cycads. The result is that in
habit the two groups are totally distinct, and it is not easy to picture a Pteridosperm
frond reduced into the simple Cordaitean leaf—at any rate, no intermediate form is
yet known. Our knowledge of Cordaitean and Pteridosperm leaves is by no means
complete, and transitional forms may yet be discovered; but until these are forth-
coming it seems necessary to give due importance to the sharp contrast between the
two types.

It is difficult to say whether we can extend to Cordaites the so-called phyllode
theory of the leaf, originally applied to the monocotyledonous leaf. According to this
theory, the typical monocotyledonous leaf represents only the proximal non-laminated
