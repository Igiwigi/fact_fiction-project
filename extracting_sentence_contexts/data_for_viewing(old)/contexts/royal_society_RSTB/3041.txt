reflecting substance.

Fig. 46 shows how by hypertrophy of secondary centres round the roots of the great
vessels, the liver and gonad, a bar of colour is formed in the thorax ; by
increase in the number and size of the elements in the third segment of
the tail, a second bar is formed. Thus the “ barred” colour-form arises.

Fig. 47 shows how by the development of minute chromatophores scattered evenly
in the muscle, on the viscera, nerve-cord and skin, one type of ‘“ mono-
chrome ” colour-form arises.

Fig. 48. Side view of the blotched colour-variety. The importance ofthis colour-form
lies in the fact that it is based on an underlying “ liner” pattern seen in
fig. 45, and that it occurs in other species of Crustacea, for example in
Hippolyte cranchii and H. pusiola. (See the text, Section V., p. 324.)

Fig. 49. Dorsal view of the “ blotched” colour-form of Hippolyte varians, showing
that the primary system may give rise indirectly to a part of the colour
pattern, which in this case is formed in a very definite and segmental
manner. Round the liver, on the carapace and pleura, bands of chromato-
phores arise,

Figs. 50-52 are side views of [ippolyte varians (primary system of adolescent-stage),
of Mysis flecuosa and of Anaspides, A comparison shows that the
neural group of chromatophores occurs in all three animals at the base of
