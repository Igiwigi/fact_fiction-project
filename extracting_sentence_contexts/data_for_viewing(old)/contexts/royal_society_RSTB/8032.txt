of bands, in figure 234, suggests in fact that this corpus luteum had already entered upon
changes which would lead to regression. The likelihood is that, like those of the preceding
. ‘generations’ in the same ovary, it was destined to regress without ever reaching the final
: , form of the fully developed corpus luteum of pregnancy. It would seem, therefore, that in
the normal course of events this animal would have undergone a further oestrous cycle
before becoming pregnant.

The corpora lutea B, and B, of E146, and the four B,, B,, B; and B, of E130 (figure 7),
were so similar histologically as to render it inconceivable that they were not formed in
each animal under the stimulus of a single endocrine impulse. This fact is illustrated in
figure 25, plate 8, where sections of the six corpora lutea of E130 are shown at the same
magnification. The sections were cut at the same thickness and mounted on a single
slide for staining, and the photomicrographical procedure was as nearly identical as possible
in each case. It will be seen that, of the six corpora lutea, one is evidently newer, and
one older, than the remaining four, and that the histological condition of these four is
identical. Reference will be made later in this account to the occurrence of multiple ovula-
tion as a regular feature of the reproductive cycle of the elephant (p. 133).

All the animals which have been described as undergoing oestrous cycles after a lactation
anoestrus were killed during the period of the year when mating is thought to be most
frequent (see p. 102). It will be noticed that although two large follicles appear to be
maturing in the ovaries of E116, the first ovulation after the quiescent period resulted
