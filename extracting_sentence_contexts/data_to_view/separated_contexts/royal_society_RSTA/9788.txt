In all cases N, increases with
increasing atomic weight, but the calculated values vary so much with the actual
errors of observation, that it is useless to attempt to find any relation between them.
5N, for Na is probably not far from 220; for the others it is larger. The values of
8N, for K, Rb, Cs might be the same, but in view of the smaller value required for
Na, this is not likely. One important fact brought out, however, is the raising the
value of « for 8, so that its ratio to ~—*5 becomes much closer to that for the P series. PROF. W.
