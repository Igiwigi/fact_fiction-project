small-stemmed and low woodâ€”density trees [45]. As such, an
unmatched comparison would not be able to fully distinguish
differences in tree growth due to the newly altered functional
characteristics of a forest (for example, if only large stems sur-
vived) or due to post-fire changes in forest conditions that may
alter the growth of individual stems (e.g. decrease in liana infes-
tation due to fire-induced mortality). For trees to be matched,
they had to belong to the same pre-El Nifo disturbance class
and the matched stem had to be within a 10% margin of both
the DBH and wood density of the burned forest stem. When
more than one tree in unburned forests met the matching criteria,
we favoured the one with the closest DBH to the tree in the burned
forest. This choice was based on the fact that DBH is quadratic in
the biomass equation used [35], as opposed to wood density,
which is only elevated to the power of one. In total, 128 trees
could be matched (i.e. 64 pairs).

After the matching, we ran linear models between the
matched trees in each disturbance class to examine if either the
growth or the carbon accumulation of trees in unburned forests
could predict that of trees in burned forests. For each pair, we
then calculated the difference in both total growth and carbon
accumulated by the end of 2017. We ran generalized linear
models to investigate which stem and forest structure factors
could be influencing these differences in radial growth and
