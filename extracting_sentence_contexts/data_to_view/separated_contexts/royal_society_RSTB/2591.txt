Yabulata.

(The latter sub-divisions I leave out of consideration, as my paper concerns the
first two only.)

It is clear from the names given to the subdivisions I. and IL. that Professor
Frecu draws a sharp limit between certain families and genera which he exclusively
regards as Madreporaria and others which he regards as “ the last remnants (‘ Super-
stiten’) of the Palseozoic Pterocorallia.”

The impossibility of defining such a limit is proved, in my opinion, by the presence
even of a single genus such as Coccophyllum. The overlapping of the Paleozoic
families upon Mesozoic families has been admitted by several authorities. Take, for
example, Professor NicHoxson’s treatment of the Turbinolida (‘ Manual,’ Joc. cit.,
p- 266) :—“The Recent genera Guynia and Haplophyllia, again, are remarkable in
the fact that the symmetry of the corallum is tetrameral, and they thus serve to lead
us to such ancient types as the Cyathaxonide of the Carboniferous rocks. ., . The
Silurian corals which have been included in the genus Cyathaaxonia belong, however,
to the genus Lindstramia, which may also be referable to this division (Turbinolide)
of the Madreporaria, though it will be here provisionally placed among the Rugosa.”
The Silurian genus Duncanella, as well as the genera Petraia (Silurian to Car-
boniferous) and Polycelia (Silur. to Permian) are farther treated by Professor
NicHOoLson as probably members of the Turbinolidx (cf. also antea, pp. 280-286). I need not, therefore, go farther in showing how prejudiced a picture Professor
Frecr’s sub-divisions are apt to give the student.
