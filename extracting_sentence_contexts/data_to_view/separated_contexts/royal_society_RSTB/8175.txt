not making any assumption about whether the assem-
blage as a whole is in equilibrium here, but simply
reflecting the fact that in the natural assemblage species
tend to vary around their mean abundances. Because
these changes in species abundances occur asynchro-
nously, they are also consistent with the portfolio
