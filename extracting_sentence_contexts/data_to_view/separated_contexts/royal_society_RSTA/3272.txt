Here, we traditionally neglect atomic diffusion in the solid. For
the sake of simplicity, we consider the case of equal thermal diffusivities in both phases. This
hypothesis does not change the selection criteria given below due to the fact that different thermal
diffusivities will change the selection constant only. To describe the hydrodynamic flows, we use the linearized Oseen model for a viscous flow

Here, U is the fluid velocity far from the dendritic surface (see figure 1), p is the pressure, p) is the
density of the liquid and v is the kinematic viscosity. The convective heat and mass transfer problem (2.1)-(2.10) written out for the case of n-fold
symmetry of crystal growth enables us to find the generalized solvability criterion, including the
effects of kinetics and convection for arbitrary PÃ©clet numbers.
