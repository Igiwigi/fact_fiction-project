2] «The glacier struggles between a condition of fluidity and rigidity. It cannot
S obey the law of semi-fluid progression (maximum velocity at the centre, which is no
5 hypothesis in the case of glaciers, but a fact), without a solution of continuity per-
Aa pendicular to its sides. If two persons hold a sheet of paper $0 as to be tense, by
the four corners, and one move two adjacent corners, whilst the other two remain at
rest or move less fast, the tendency will be to tear the paper into sbreds parallel
to the motion; in the glacier the fissures thus formed are filled with percolated
water, which is then frozen. It accords with this view,—lst, that the glacier moves
fastest in the centre, and that the loop of the curve described coincides (by observa-
tion) with the line of swiftest motion. 2nd. That the bands are least distinct near the
centre, for there the difference of velocity of two adjacent stripes parallel to the
length of the glacier is nearly nothing ; but near the sides, where the retardation is
greatest, it is a maximum. 3rd. It accords with direct observation that the differ-
