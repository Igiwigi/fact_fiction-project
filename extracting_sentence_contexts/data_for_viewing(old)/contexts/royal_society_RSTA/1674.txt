Here we consider a concept for a habitat of specific size, with a growing area 50m in diameter
(2000 m?) over living quarters of the same area. This size is informed by the 25 m depth of regolith
needed to balance atmospheric pressure, and its 40° angle of repose. Illumination of the growing

area at normal solar intensity is accomplished by use of a reflector of the type shown in figure 2,
also 50 m in diameter, to collect the same area of sunlight. The focal spot will have a power in the
450-650 nm band of 1 MW, and a diameter of 1.3 m, 0.026 of the 50m entrance aperture.

In broad brush outline, the structure we consider shown in figure 4 resembles the Atreus
Treasury in being built as a cone of blocks under compression from soil above. In fact, the weight
of the 25m of regolith we envisage is no greater than that of the 4m thickness of soil over the
Treasury. The conical corbelled type of structure of the Treasury is favoured because it is adapted
to both regolith loading and to inclusion of the oculus opening at the top while still keeping all
the blocks in compression. We envisage that detailed finite-element modelling and local testing
(allowing for Earth’s six times higher gravity) will be used to optimize and validate the design.

The concept for the 50m diameter habitat shown in figure 4 uses a structural cone 25m high
with a 90° angle. Light is brought in at the apex through a 25 m tall light pipe passing through the
regolith overlayer. Light exiting the pipe enters the habitat through a 1.3 m diameter fused quartz
pressure window. It is spread out over the full cone angle to illuminate all of the 50m diameter
floor at the standard intensity of sunlight in the wavelength range of visible light.
