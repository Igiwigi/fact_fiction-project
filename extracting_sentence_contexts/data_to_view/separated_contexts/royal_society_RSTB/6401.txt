What appear to be transverse septa occasionally occur, but the preservation
is not sufficiently good to allow of more than passing notice of this ; one such
septum is seen in the figure near the top right-hand corner. At places slender
tubes were detected but they had mostly broken down. It is not necessary to enter into any discussion here of the facts described above. They afford the proof for Downtonian specimens of the known structure of
Prototaxites. Minor differences, for example as regards the proportion of the two
systems of tubes in the transverse section, may depend on specific differences, but
no attempt has been made to survey the fragments occurring throughout the
Downtonian from the systematic point of view.
