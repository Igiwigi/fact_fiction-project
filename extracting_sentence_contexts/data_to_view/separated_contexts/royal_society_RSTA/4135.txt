A consistently connected cyclic-4 system (3.3) is non-contextual (by definition 6.4) if : s
and only if (5.2) is satisfied. D4

This is a special case of theorem 7.2 below, which in turn is a special case of a theorem proved : a
in [5] (see also [1,2,4,21]) that applies to a broad class of cyclic systems, of which cyclic-4 ones are :&
a special case. .

7. A general definition and criterion of contextuality in the contextuality-by-
default framework

The fact that we relate definition 6.4 to the notion of maximal couplings for connections reflects
the intuition we are guided by and suggests a natural way of generalizing contextuality beyond
consistently connected systems. The intuition in question can be explicated as follows. For an inconsistently connected system,
we interpret the non-coincidence of the distributions of Ri and RE as evidence that changes
in context, c—> c’, ‘directly’ influence the measurement of q.
