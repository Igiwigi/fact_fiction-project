In figure 4 from this study, it
can be seen that the CME can be decomposed into two distinct domains: a central, nearly circular
inner core threaded by strongly twisted magnetic fields, surrounded by an envelope with more
deformed shape, due to its stronger coupling with the ambient solar wind. The MC that would
be identified by an in situ observation would be the inner core of this composite structure. As a
matter of fact, strongly twisted magnetic field lines could inhibit the expansion and size of MFR
as modelling of in situ observations of MCs suggest (e.g. [63]). Clearly, more studies of the duration of CME impacts are needed. This should be a rather
straightforward task given the availability of 3D geometrical reconstructions and associated
ENLIL and other MHD simulations for a large statistical sample of CMEs observed during the
STEREO era.
