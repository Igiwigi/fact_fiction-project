termine when these additions cease, or indeed whether they cease at all before the
addition of villous tufts, which I am very much disposed to think are formed by the
same kind of cells. These cells will be particularly referred to in a future paperZ.

374. In Plate XXIV. figs. 186. 187 and 189. the incipient chorion is seen to have
been just beginning to imbibe transparent fluid, and to rise from the membrane f.
Whether the s0-called © disc” brought with the ovam from the ovary contributes to
supply this fluid, I do not know ; but when the chorion is in an incipient state, many
of the cells of the © disc” are sometimes found lying around it ; and in other instances
there is in the same situation, a transparent fluid, which may possibly have arisen
from the liquefaction of those ovarian cells.

Application of some of the foregoing Facts to the Physiology of Cells.

375. Exiting views regarding © cells” have been already briefly stated (par. 324).
The Appendix contains them more in detail.

376. Presuming that what is known regarding cells warrants the conclusion that
they have essentially the same structure in animals and plants, I offer the following
remarks as applicable equally to the animal and vegetable cellh. And as researches
have hitherto related chiefly to the cells of plants, I shall refer for the most part to
what has been published respecting these.

377. That I have found the nucleus at the surface of its cell, is shown by figures
in the present and in the two preceding memoirs. . As this, however, rarely continues
