F. treated a curved bar (tore) of wide rectangular cross-section,
having boundaries defined by

r=4, r=6, z=+8 units. (38)

(Since the computational aspects of this problem are closely identical with that of
Problem (i, 2) a, and since little practical interest attaches to the bending of curved bars

by pure couples, it did not seem worth while to introduce the complication of ‘irregular’
stars; and the wide rectangular section has theoretical interest as a test of the limitations
of the solution of Golovin and others (Southwell 1942, §33) for narrow rectangular
sections.)

The symmetry of the problem allowed us to confine attention to one-half of the cross-
section. A square net of side 0-5 unit was employed, and a value 100 was attached to
7B in (16) A. Corresponding with (28) we have in this problem, as finite-difference
approximations to the governing equations,

F, = $1 +$2+ $3 +94— o—2 (¢2—$4) +50 = 0, |

and corresponding with (33), as boundary conditions obtained by elimination of
‘fictitious points’ in the manner of §§ 21-2,
at the internal surface (r = 4)

and at the plane aid (z= —8),
Fy = 42+ $1—260— 7 (Pau) + 20+ 50 = 0,
