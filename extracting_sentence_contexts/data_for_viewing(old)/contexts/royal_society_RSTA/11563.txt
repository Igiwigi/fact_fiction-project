The copper spiral had previously been heated in a vacuum to drive off occluded
hydrogen. With regard to the discharge from the sodium amalgam cathode it was
found advisable not to pass it too frequently, as it absorbs nitrogen rather quickly,
but not so quickly as it absorbs oxygen. All the purifying arrangements were
placed close to the testing bulb and between it and the rest of the apparatus so
as to be as efficient as possible. After the nitrogen had been prepared, the copper in
the hot tube was always found to be quite bright except at the front end.

The positive ionisation in nitrogen is small compared with that in oxygen, especially
at low pressures As we have seen, a small quantity of oxygen has a very big effect
on the positive leak, and it might therefore be supposed that the leaks observed in
nitrogen were due to traces of oxygen which had not been removed by the purifying
processes. ‘This, however, is rendered improbable by the fact that the ionisation in
nitrogen differs in character in certain important respects from that in oxygen. The
current requires a greater electromotive force to saturate it under similar conditions,
and it also showed time changes, after altering the applied E.M.F., similar to those
observed in a new wire. These changes were never observed in a wire which had
been heated in oxygen for a long time.

On letting in fresh nitrogen the leak was always found to have a much bigger
value than that at which it finally settled down. The rate of decay was very big at
first, but after a time became extremely slow, so that there still seemed to be a slow
decrease after several hours’ heating at 900° C. This decrease may have been due to
the gradual absorption of oxygen. No decrease in pressure could be observed, but
this does not prove anything, as the decrease in the pressure required to account for
