being sown of a kind in each week. Thus the scale of the experiment was so small as
might appear absurd, and it is gratifying to be able to record the fact that the
conclusions drawn from this experiment were in no way vitiated, nor indeed greatly
amplified, by the large-scale experiment of 1913.

The use of the experiment for critical purposes by comparison of different strains
was unfortunately prevented by difficulties connected with our transference to the
Government service, whereby our stocks of pure-strain seed passed out of our
possession during the actual sowings of 1911. Further, with such tiny plots it was not
possible to prevent the irrigation of one sowing from affecting most of the previous
sowings ; this merely ensured that water supply was never likely to be a limiting
factor in the early stages of growth, but it prevented the results from being fairly
compared with field conditions, though in point of fact we now know that such
comparison would have been justifiable. The sowing which gave the best result
between February 28 and April 11 was that of March 22. We, therefore, assigned
the optimal sowing date for the Cairo-Giza district to March 22, for the year 1911.

In conjunction with the conclusions drawn by Mr. Hugues, and with Prince
Tovussounâ€™s data, it seemed fairly evident that the optimum sowing date would vary
very little from year to year in any given site, that it would be later in the cooler
north, and that it was actually later than the conventional date of sowing practised
by the fellaheen cultivators.

With these preliminary indications in hand, we can proceed to the full sowing-date
experiment of 1913,
