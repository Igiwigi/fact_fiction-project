how individual-level mechanisms give rise to group dynamics.
Furthermore, continued efforts to merge collective motion
modelling and animal movement analyses will provide the
foundations for improved, quantitative understanding of
animal movement.

Compared to the vast literature on the general topic of
collective motion, only a few studies have examined how indi-
vidual variation in behavioural rules lead to different emergent
properties. Most animal collective movement studies have gen-
erally been interested in emergent population-level properties,
and thus have traditionally neglected variation among individ-
uals, the uniqueness of individuals, and the fact that
individuals change in these characteristics during their life-
time. Yet, recent theoretical models regarding collective
motion based on individual movement decision rules are
becoming increasingly sophisticated, and are challenging the

established approach by relying on more mechanistic, individ-
ual-based models [20]. These models represent an important
step towards increasing biological realism when modelling
collective motion.

Starting from our model as a very illustrative example, we
observed that when assuming groups composed of identical
