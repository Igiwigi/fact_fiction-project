DIALYTIC SEPARATION OF GASES BY COLLOID SEPTA. 415

a body of gutta percha, softened probably by a drying-oil. From its softness and
inness, this sheet of gutta percha appeared at first highly promising. But it appears
not to be free from small apertures for any considerable surface. When a small sound
portion was operated upon, air was found to percolate through it very slowly. In a tube
Hliffusiometer of 1:3 metre in length and 20 millims. in diameter, closed at the top with
his septum supported by stuceo, the mercurial column fell from 28-7 to 22:625 inches
n 183 hours. The gas which had entered above the mercury measured 13:54 cub.
zentims., and was found to contain 20-2 oxygen to 79:8 nitrogen—a proof that the air
ad entered by gas-diffusion. The material is in fact of sufficient porosity to permit the
molecular passage of gases in a slow manner.

Varnishes of gelatine and of drying-oil have been tried as dialytic septa, but hitherto
githout marked rexsults.
