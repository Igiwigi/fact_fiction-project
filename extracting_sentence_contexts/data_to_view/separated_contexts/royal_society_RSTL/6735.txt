opinion may be entertained with reference to some of the explanations I have ventured
to offer. My observations upon various tissues in different stages of development have convinced
me that the growth of the cells or elementary parts is a ninch more simple process than
is generally supposed, and consists merely in a certain proportion of germinal matter
undergoing conyersion into formed material, while at the same time pabulum pPasses into
the germinal matter, and the wonderful properties or powers possessed by this substance
are communicated to it. By this formation of new germinal matter the proportion of
the latter converted into formed material, and the formed material which is destroyed
and remoyed, may be completely compensated for,

There is a certain relation between the proportion of germinal matter and formed
material of the cell, which varies at different ages and under different cireumstances, as
I have shown.
