As the “ fine’ vessels are traced further towards the surface they are seen to retain
their characteristic sharp contours throughout and to terminate by branching in various
directions (Plate 88, fig. 25, f.v.) just beneath the superficial capillary plexus connecting
with it abruptly here and there by short anastomoses.

It will be noticed in fig. 25 that the capillaries that form the surface network are of
considerably greater calibre than the terminal branches of the “fine” vessels that
open into them. It is also to be observed that the lymphatic vessels with which this
surface network is directly continuous contain, when an injection of them is made
through the “ fine ” vessels, a denser mass than do the actual capillaries, and that in
the main lymphatic trunks and sinuses the mass is again less in quantity.

These facts point to the conclusion that the lymph vessels and the superficial plexus
of capillaries are parts of one continuous system and that the terminal branches of the
‘fine’ vessels open abruptly into this system, partly into the lymph vessels just deep
to the surface plexus and partly by their branching extremities into the meshes of the
capillary plexus itself.

In discussing the mode of connection of the “ fine’ vessels with the lymphatics in
Lophius (4, p. 44), I pointed out that the little transverse connectives between the two,
similar to those described above in the Cod, appeared (in the mucous membranes) to
be blocked by valves arranged to direct the flow from the lymph plexus to the “ fine ”
vessels. In the Cod, although the injection mass is often concentrated in these little
