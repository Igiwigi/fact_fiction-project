AND GEOLOGICAL RELATIONS OF CERTAIN HOT SPRINGS. 603

scrambled along this parallel to the river for a distance of a mile or a mile and a half
without any indication of hot springs ; at last, in a ravine to the right, at a very con-
Siderable height above the Tet, I discovered steam rising near a cascade. This spring,
which I shall call (A), I at one time conceived to be identical with the Source de la
Cascade of AxGLapa; I am now, however, persuaded that it is a different one, and was
perhaps never visited by him. From his description it clearly appears that his © Source
de la Cascade” was in the Gorge of Carensac, through which flows the Torrent Real,
near Thuez, and therefore considerably above the trifling ravine I have mentioned,
and which is distinctly marked nearly opposite Canavielles in the Departmental Map
of the Atlas National. This, in fact, is the distinctive mark of the spring (A) just
mentioned. It occurs in a small ravine very near the Tet, but at a considerable
height above it, a/most opposite to the copper mine of Canavielles, and within sight of
the Graus {Olette. It is on the right bank of the small torrent traversing the ravine,
and issues copiously from a cleft in a slaty granite rock. The principal point of issue
is well marked, and at some height above the torrent, into which it flows. It is 8ul-
phureous, and contains bartgine.

The other spring (B) I have distinctly identified with the © Source du Bord de la
Riviere” of AnGLapa, whose position he has very accurately defined. It is a little
further down the bank of the riyer, but instead of being at a great height above it, it
is only separated from the Tet by a piece of flat meadow. It is almost exactly oppo-
site to the mine of Canavielles, and its aspect is towards the chasm through which
