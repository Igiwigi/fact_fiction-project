volumes of these two solutions, tle more dilute solution contained, according to the
hypothesis, less than one-eighth of the mass of potassium iodide in the stronger
solution, since of that which remained a larger fraction was dissociated ; and, corre-
spondingly, the total mass of ions in unit volume of the more dilute solution
Glas more than one-eighth of that present in the same volume of the stronger
solution. If then the rate of interaction of ions is different from that of the
Bolecules from which they are formed—if, for example, the time needed for the
guange, nH?O? + 2H" + 21" = n(2H?O + I*), were different from that needed for
 (H20" + 2H1I = 2H?0 + I*)—the total rate due to molecular and ionic interaction
‘Would vary with the amount of ionic dissociation. But it is not so; the rate with

Blass of substance acting. All our observations show the same fact, though some of

“experiments are either, (1) so near complete dissociation in solutions of normal

darther dilution, or (2) that not much dissociation has yet: taken place in solutions of
