The presence of worker-like individuals in Archotermopsis has a direct bianiny upon
the origin of the worker castes among Termites. Eleven examples of these forms
were dissected, and they were found to closely resemble the nymphs in most of their
anatomical characters. The chief difference was to be observed in the gonads, which
are larger in size, probably owing to the fact that the worker-like forms are nearer
sexual maturity. Many of the ova are also in a more advanced stage in develop-
ment (vide p. 124). In three females the ovaries were considerably larger than in
any of the winged females which were dissected.
