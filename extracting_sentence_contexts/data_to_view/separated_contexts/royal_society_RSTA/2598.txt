If d/LÂ«1
and m > 3, large distance contributions to the interaction will disappear [53]. This makes possible
the existence of intensive thermodynamic properties of condensed phases, which are independent
of the size of the system L. Such systems are called weakly coupled, due to the fact that most of
the energy of a particle comes from interactions between nearby neighbours. However, for d/L <1, m <3, the contributions from more distant particles will dominate over
those of nearby ones [53]. In such cases (which are called strongly coupled systems), the size of
the system matters, as occurs for gravitational forces where n = 1 and where distant planets, stars
and galaxies are still strongly interacting with one another.
