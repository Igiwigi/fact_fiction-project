It was now, however, observed that, if
the distance separating the quadrants was increased to } inch, the sensibility tended
to a limit for a large charge instead of first increasing and then diminishing,

Before replacing the new needle, it was carefully weighed with the platinum wire
attached and the weight dipping into the acid, and a calculation was made as to the
magnitude of the effect that should arise from the change of the pull of the fibres due
to any upward or downward attraction of the needle by the quadrants. This
calculation showed that for a P.D. of 3000 volts between the needle and the quadrants,
the amount of such attraction was quite unable to account for the observed diminution
of sensibility with large charges in the needle. Dr. HopKiyson says in his paper,
“Increased tension of the fibres from electrical attraction does not therefore account
for the whole of the facts, although it does play the principal part.” The experiments
that we made at the end of 1886 and beginning of 1887, confirmed by the calculation
above referred to, proved that, at any rate in our specimen of the quadrant electro-
meter, the principal part of the anomalous action was not caused by an increased
tension of the fibres, and that, therefore, some other cause must be looked for to
explain the observed results. The following investigation was, therefore, undertaken
to ascertain the cause, and the means of removing it, and we are happy to say that it
