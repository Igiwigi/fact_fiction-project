alongside the feed-point gap and connected to the vacuum system. Sleeve electrodes were
fitted round the tube at the same distance apart as the gap on the torus. These electrodes
were connected to the terminals of the torus. With atmospheric pressure in the torus the
condensers were discharged in the usual manner so that the voltage across the feed-point gap
was applied to the sleeve electrodes. Although a wide range of pressures was tried in the tube
no visible discharge was observed.

Workers who have studied the discharges produced by such sleeve electrodes (J. Thomson
1930, 1934 & 1937 and others) have produced glow discharges with voltages considerably less
than those used here. But in none of the papers on this type of discharge is a frequency less
thana megacycle quoted, and itseems likely that the frequency used here is too low to produce
such an effect. This experiment thus leads to the conclusion that no appreciable amount of
ionization is caused by the ‘electrostatic’ field. This is confirmed by the fact that the break-
down potentials were the same when a narrow feed-point gap was used.

After breakdown the highly ionized gas will be similar to a metallic conductor, and the
magnitude of the field in the gas will depend on the capacitative coupling between the copper
coating and the gas. A simple calculation shows that this capacity is of the order of 260 pF
and its impedance to 150 kc./sec. is 4000 ohms. The resistance of the gas, however, was found
to be of the order of 0-1 ohm. Since the peak voltage across the gap after breakdown is about
4000 V the voltage developed in the gas will be about a tenth ofa volt and the current about
an ampere. Such a current is negligible compared with the 104A due to the ring discharge.
