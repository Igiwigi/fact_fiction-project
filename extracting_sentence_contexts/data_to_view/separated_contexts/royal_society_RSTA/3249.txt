We
could therefore estimate the extrapolated Tg onset (our proxy for Tg, fictive) for all samples, by
applying the temperature correction (thermal lag) determined by the melting points of pure
metals (subtracting of 4.5 K) and then further subtracting these 14K. Temperature corrected data
are listed in table 2.

(a) Carbonate glass transition temperatureâ€”bulk H70 relationship

Figure 4 displays the limiting fictive temperature of the carbonate-water solution as a function
of the carbonate weight fraction content. The glass transition temperature of pure water is
taken from literature [35,36]. The data show that increasing water content decreases the glass
transition temperature of the amorphous mixture.
