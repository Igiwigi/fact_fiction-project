trade-offs between defence and investment in immediate
reproductive success may occur for multiple reasons. For
example, the latter may require fast growth, but this comes
at a cost to the former. We assume competitiveness, c, is a


function of two parameters a (the intensity of intraspecific
competition) and B (the strength of trade-offs): the rate of
fitness accumulation per time unit spent alive and cancer
free is assumed proportional to c* = (1 - d*)*.

This is specified as ‘proportional to’ rather than as ‘equal to’
to take into account the fact that fitness is relative to conspeci-
fics. Thus, if surrounded by many other competitive
individuals, fitness of the focal individual may remain low,
but for the subsequent analysis contrasting alternative life his-
tories of a focal individual the effect of others stays constant
and does not have to be included [15]. Here, c=1-d?
describes the individual’s competitiveness assuming it does
not yet have cancer. Cancerous individuals are assumed to
be non-competitive and thus gain zero reproductive success
while alive with cancer.

Competitiveness, as defined above, is a declining function
of cancer defences, which reflects the assumption that defences
