weevil, Hylobius abietis, and the view was tentatively formed that the newly-found
worms were in some way connected with the frit-fly, possibly as parasites of it. This
view received support from the fact that none of them were observed in dissections of
healthy stems, although specimens of certain free-living nematodes were found in these.

Several more affected stems were opened up and from many, but not all, of them the
new worms were obtained. By June 5 it was clear that the male worms always lacked
a mouth stylet, whilst the females were provided with a comparatively massive one.
The females also were found to have the uterus crowded with very small spermatozoa,
a feature in which they resembled the young spermatised females of Allantonema
described by WULKER.

This fact further confirmed the view, which by now had become fully formed, that
the worms would turn out to be parasitic in the frit-fly. Proof that this provisional
hypothesis was well founded was obtained on June 11, when a frit-fly larva, previously
washed to rid it of any free nematodes which might be clinging to it, was opened with
needles, and from its body-cavity there floated out seven female worms identical in
structure with those already found in the destroyed plant tissues surrounding the fly
larvee.

From this time onwards more frit larvae were collected and dissected, and worms were -
found in them. Some of the larvee were found to contain the larvee of Hymenopterous
parasites in addition to the new worm. What the ultimate fate of the latter is, under
this state of parasitism of the host, it is impossible to say. In due course pup were
collected ; some were opened so as to yield various stages in the development of the
