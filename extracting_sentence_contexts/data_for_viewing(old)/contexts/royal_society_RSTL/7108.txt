these exhibit the most distinct transverse markings. The markings, however, gradually
cease, and the fibre becomes a mere line, which is lost in the connective tissue at the
summit of the papilla. The arrangement will be understood if Plate XXL. figs, 1 &9
be referred to.


MINUTE ANATOMY OF THE PAPILLX OF THE FROG'S TONGUE. 453

The 80-called nuclei or masses of germinal matter in connexion with these fine mius-
cular fibres present several points which will well repay attentive study. These masses
of germinal matter are sometimes twice or three times the width of the fibre with which
they are connected. In a paper published in Part XIV. of my *Archives,” I have adduced
facts which render it probable that these nuclei or masses of germinal matter change
their position in a very remarkable manner during life.

The conclusions I have arrived at upon this point are as follows :—

The masses of germinal matter appear to move along the surface of the already-formed
muscular tissue, and as they move part of their substance becomes converted into muscle
(Plate XXII. fig. 13). Tt is in this way that new muscle is formed and new muscular

Aissue is added to that already produced. The germinal matter itself does not diminish
M $ize, because it absorbs as much pabulum as will compensate for what it loses of
Ds own substance by conversion into tissue. In the young muscle the nucleus increases
