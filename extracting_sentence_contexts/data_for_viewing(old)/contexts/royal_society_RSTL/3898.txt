duced between the terminal wires, sparks, through the space of #;th of an inch, were
obtained ; and when the double electroscope (fig. 4) was included in the circuit, and
the discs @ and b were approximated, an uninterrupted succession of sparks would
pass between the dises. These effects, which I have repeatedly shown to many
friends, are most brilliant. On one occasion they were continued uninterruptedly
day and night for upwards of five weeks; and although some months have now
elapsed since this battery was completed, it still exhibits the same effects.

17. When the experimenter was standing on the ground, and consequently, as has
been already explained, in actual, although imperfect connection, with the battery, he
could draw sparks from either terminal. We shall, in the sequel, be enabled to trace,
with more precision, the rise of this tension ; for the present, we are only concerned
in establishing its existence, and thereby proving the first fact, that fension or electro-
static effects precede, and are independent of, the completion of the voltaic circuit.

18. Hitherto we have not obtained any insight into the condition of the dynamic
effects under such circumstances of antecedent tension. For testing the presence
of what is usually termed the current, or in other words, obtaining the means of
observing the electro-dynamic effects, I used the instrument which is best suited
for examining such phenomena, and which invariably attests the instant completion
of a yoltaic circuit. An exceedingly delicate galvanometer was introduced at B (se
fig. 1), and the two condensing plates Â« and b of the double electroscope (fig. 4) were
respectively attached by wires to the terminals N and P of the battery, fig. 1. If
great care was taken not to make any connection with the ground, the party mani-
pulating being himself well insulated on shell-lac, no action could be perceived on
