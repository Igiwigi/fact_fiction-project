The absorption spectra of some colloidal solutions of silver, prepared by Brepic’s
method,* have been measured by Enrennarr. The continuous curve shown in fig. 3,
representing the calculated absorptions of a diffusion of silver spheres in water, is of
the same form as that which, according to EHRENHAF?’s measurements, represents
the absorption of visible light by a colloidal solution of silver.t Using ultra-violet
light, he further found that a brown colloidal solution of silver, examined before
coagulation had seriously affected its colour, showed an absorption band which began
at = ‘503 and attained a maximum at \ = ‘380, while the fluid was again quite
transparent at \ = 335. Except for the fact that the maximum ordinate of the
calculated curve for silver spheres in water is at \ = ‘389 instead of at \ = °380, the
above observations admirably describe the continuous curve shown in fig. 38. Since
the dotted curve given in that figure shows a maximum at \ = ‘360, and the absorp-
tion band does not begin until \ = *450, about, the colour of the “ colloidal” solution
is not that which would be exhibited by a suspension of discrete silver molecules, 2.e.,
by a true solution.
