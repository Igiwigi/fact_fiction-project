In this experiment, magnifying power was evidently injurious
to penetrating power. I do not account for this upon the principle
that by magnifying we make an object less bright ; for, when
opticians have also demonstrated that brightness is diminished
by magnifying, it must again be understood as relating only to
the mtrinsic brightness of the magnified picture; its absolute
brightness, which is the only one that concerns us at present,
must always remain the same.* The real explanation of the
fact, I take to be, that while the light collected is employed in
magnifying the object, it cannot be exerted in giving penetrating
power. Â® This may be proved thus.
