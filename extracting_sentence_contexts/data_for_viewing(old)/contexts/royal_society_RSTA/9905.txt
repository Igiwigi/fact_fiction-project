obvious reason why such seasonal variation should be identical for days of standard
disturbance,

Comment was passed in (C) on the great increase in « in D through disturbance,
representing on the average an advance of over two hours in time. The corresponding
change in V is, however, an advance of over four hours. The corresponding change
in I is retrograde and roughly equal to that in D. The winter results for #, in H had
better be regarded as unreliable. At the other seasons «, in H shows an advance of
time, though considerably less than in D, The influence of disturbance on @, #, and
a,, when regarded from the point of view of the equivalent in time, is in general
relatively small, and is decidedly less in I, H, and V than in D, The differences
between the disturbed and quiet day values of «; and «, in the three former elements
are in fact generally less than one would have anticipated even on the hypothesis that
the phase angles are really unaffected by disturbance.

Force Vector of Diurnal Inequality.

§ 23. The departure of the magnetic elements from their mean value for the day
may be regarded as due to a disturbing force of constantly varying intensity and
direction. Table XVI. gives particulars of the direction and intensity of this force at
each hour of the day for the year as a whole. Analogous results could, of course, be
derived from the diurnal inequalities for individual months or seasons of the year.

¢ denotes the angle which the vertical plane containing the resultant force makes
with the vertical plane through the geographical meridian, measured from north to
