Again, although Thecosmilia may also have a
massive corallum, the dignity of the polyp never descends so far as in that of a
typical Latimeandroid. And we shall generally find that there is a certain standard
of independence for each genus, which may be taken as a measure of the genus in
placing it systematically. We may, in fact, use the form of the corallum and its
habit of increase as a generic feature when we keep in view the highest degree of
polypal individuality attained and the lowest. No sooner do we keep both ends of
the scale before us than “ gemmation” and “ fissiparity” merge in one another.
“ Fissiparity” I take to be simply a hastened development of buds under certain con-
ditions and at certain periods of “ vegetative growth” in the life of the coral. And
the buds, which form long meandroid series and never develop fully, probably perform
in an Astraid colony the functions of a coenenchymal area in “ Perforates,” namely,
the rapid circulation of nutritive material throughout the colony.
