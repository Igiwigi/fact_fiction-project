Yang et al. [96] have shown that suppression respect to the nuclear compartments, such as the periphery

of Firre expression by shRNA causes a decrease in association and nucleolus. An alternative explanation for the hinge de-

H3K27me3 on the Xi. Thus, Firre RNA may help maintain the could be that it reflects the fact that many layers of Xi repres-

heterochromatic state of the Xi. However, suppression of Firre sion are in place. It would therefore be interesting to
