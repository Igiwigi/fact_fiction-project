42.)

VIII. The fact that the times of transpiration for the same gas in capillary tubes,
and at considerable densities, are inversely as the density and independent of the
temperature â€”MAxwWELL* and GRAHam.t

IX. The difference in the variation of the times of transpiration for different gases,
shown by the fact that the logarithmic curves for hydrogen cannot be made to fit those
for air. (Plates 47, 48, and 49.)

X. The approximation towards a constant value of the ratio which the thermal
differences of pres8ure bear to the mean pres8ure as the density diminishes, whatever
be the gas or plate, the ratio is that of the difference of the square roots of the
absolute temperatures to the square root of the absolute temperature.
