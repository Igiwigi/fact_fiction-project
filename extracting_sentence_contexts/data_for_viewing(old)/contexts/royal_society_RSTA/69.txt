As in [13, theorem 2.1], under (4.1), one can extend JN to @ x X x P(X) by the classical Mc Shane
construction, i.e. by defining for every (0,x,v)€@ x X x P(X), the cost FN(6,x,v) by the formula

1
FN@,x,v) = inf JN ;,%,x-1) + odo (6,9) + @ | Wy |v», —— Do by,

The previous assumptions are therefore equivalent to the fact that player is cost is given by
1
IN xi x-1) = FN Gi, x1, x) =F | 6;,Xi, Noi > 8x;
jxi
with FN a sequence of uniformly equicontinuous functions on @ x X x P(X).
