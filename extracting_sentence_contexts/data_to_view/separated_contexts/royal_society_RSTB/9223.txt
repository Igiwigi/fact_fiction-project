Figure 4. Invasive neuromodulation techniques. (a) With cooling deactivation, cortical tissue temperature is reduced to block neural activity temporarily [71].
(b) With chemical deactivation, pharmacological agents are used to block neural activity temporarily [72]. (c) With electrical microstimulation, low-amplitude
electrical currents are delivered through microelectrodes to drive neural activity in small groups of neurons [73]. Microstimulation effects can depend strongly
on stimulation parameters like amplitude, pulse width, pulse train duration and pulse train frequency. (d) With optogenetics, light is used to drive activity in
neuron populations that have been genetically sensitized to light through the expression of light-sensitive proteins [74].
