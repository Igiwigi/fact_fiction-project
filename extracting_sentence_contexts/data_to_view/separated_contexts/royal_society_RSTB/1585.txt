On the other hand, the leverage of the Weberian ossicles in the Siluride
S iy very different from that of the Mammalian auditory ossicles. The approximate
5 equality iu the length of the two arms of the leyer in the former ease is sufficient to
& prove that no increased effect is gained in the transmission of any form of motion
©, from the walls of the air-bladder to the anditory organ. In fact, so far from there
2 wing any specivl adaptations in the Weberian mechanism for this purpose, which
would certainly seem to be necessary in the case of sound transmission, the facts of
= structure point quite in the opposite direction. The nature of the ligamentous
6 conection between the different ossicles, and the fact that the moyements of the
& Seaphia mush take place in a plane at right angles to the posterior entrance of the
2 ayo sinus impuris,* and the division of the neck of the sinus endolymphaticus into
6 the vizht and left halves of the ductus endolymphations at right angles to the former,
& seem better adapted to diminish rather than intensify the effect produced on the
8 aulilory organ by slight vibrations or other movements of the walls of the air-

bladder.

£ (d.) Hasse (18), in opposing the applieation of Weser's theory to the Cyprinids,

@ lays some stress on the objection that the perilymph of the atrial cavities and eavum
= sintis impariis is contained within the interapaces af a reticilay connective tissne, and
6 therefore is ill adapted to transmit vibrations to the endolymph of the sinus
5 tndolymphatiens. This objection has considerable force when applied to the Cyprinids,
3 and possibly also to many other Ostariophysem, but is of little moment so far as the
= Siluride ure concerned.
