ES cell-formation has gone on; carbonic acid has been decomposed, and carbon and the

Selements of water have been transformed into cellulose ; the plants have drawn the nitro-

Sgenous compounds from the older cells to perform the mysterious office of the formation

Eof new cells (see Notes on growth, Appendix, pp. 559, 561); those parts have been deye-

Aloped which required the smallest amount of Nitrogen ; and all the stages of growth

#have been passed through to the formation of glumes, pales, and awns for the seed.

Eln fact, the plants have performed all the functions that it is possible for a plant to

Sperform when deprived of a sufficient supply of combined Nitrogen. They have gone

Son thus increasing their organic constituents with one constant amount of combined

| until the percentage of that element in the vegetable matter is far below the

Sordinary amount of itâ€”that is, until the composition indicates that further development

Shad ceased for want of a supply of available Nitrogen.

a Throughout all these phases, water saturated with free Nitrogen has been passing
