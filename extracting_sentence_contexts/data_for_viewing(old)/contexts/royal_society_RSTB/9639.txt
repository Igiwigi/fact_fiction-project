stitutions are obviously easier than others (e.g. transitions
versus transversions or Asp — Glu versus Asp — Trp)
and exchangeability matrices were rapidly introduced
[39]. The General-Time-Reversible (GTR) model is now
widely used for nucleotides, where it only requires eight
parameters, but much less for amino acids because then it
requires 208 parameters. Yet, when datasets are large, an
amino acid GTR matrix has a better fit than empirical
matrices (e.g. WAG and LG) [40].

(2) Heterogeneity of the substitution rate across sites. Following
the seminal observations of Uzzell & Corbin [41], various
methods have been developed to handle the fact that
some sites are more susceptible than others to accumu-
late substitutions, and thus to generate artefacts. The
gamma distribution appears as a good compromise
between computational efficiency and biological realism.
That is why it is now widely used. More refined models
(such as mixture of gamma or Dirichlet processes) might
nevertheless prove to be useful for solving difficult
questions.

(3) Heterogeneity of the substitution process across sites. The fact
that only a few amino acids are possible at a given pos-
ition (e.g. charged or hydrophobic amino acids) was
