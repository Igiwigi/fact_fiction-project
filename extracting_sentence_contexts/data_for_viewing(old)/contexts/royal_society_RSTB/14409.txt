groups [8-10] observed dilation or loss of t-tubules in ischae-
mic and dilated cardiomyopathies. Further imaging studies
using scanning ion conductance microscopy and confocal
microscopy identified marked disorganization and_ loss
of t-tubules in failing hearts in a range of conditions and
experimental systems, including congestive heart failure [2],
dilated cardiomyopathy [11], chronic myocardial infarction
(MI) [11] and heart failure secondary to thoracic banding
[12]. However, these models, albeit fundamental to further
our understanding, are of limited translational relevance to
cardiac failure post-myocardial insult in humans.

In fact, using two-photon laser scanning microscopy,
Ohler ef al. [13] found no changes in the organization and
structure of t-tubules in failing human hearts, which may
be accounted for by selection of relatively healthy cardiac
myocytes during cell isolation. By contrast Seidel et al. [14]
demonstrated sheet-like remodelling of the t-tubule network
in failing human hearts. These differences may also be recon-
ciled by tissue heterogeneity, whereby Crossman et al. [3]
found that a diseased t-tubule area can coexist with an adja-
cent area consisting of healthy t-tubules within a human
failing myocyte. As well as t-tubule loss and disorganization,
more recent work [15,16] has reported a striking increase
in longitudinal tubules combined with a decrease in trans-
