On the whole, the theoretical thresholds for the combined development of active larvae
and stages within cocoons of the three species of rat-fleas (tables 17, 18, 20, 22)* were
slightly higher than the values for their separate developments (tables 15, 16, 19, 21). This
is due to the fact that the thresholds of their pupal and adult emergence were higher than
those of the development of their previous stages, which is borne out by the failure of
a high percentage of prepupae and adults to extricate themselves from larval and pupal
skins at 13° C (table 14).

* The theoretical thresholds for the development of stages within cocoons and for the combined develop-
ment of larva and pupa of the male of X. brasiliensis were 11-63 and 11-68° C respectively, and for those of
X. astia were 1234 and 13-34° C.
