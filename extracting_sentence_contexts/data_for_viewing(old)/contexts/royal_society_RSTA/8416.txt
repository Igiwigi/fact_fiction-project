are in both cases larger than when we assumed the existence of a single period only: 21+95
against 17-05, and 17-47 against 11-48. So far from having improved matters by the
assumption of a second period, we have made them very appreciably worse: we get a
worse and not a better estimate of wu, when w,; and w,_, are brought into account
than when we confine ourselves to u,_, and uv,-, alone. ‘To put it moderately, there is
at least no evidence that any secondary period exists—a conclusion in entire accord with
that of Larmor and Yamaga (loc. cit.). The result also bears out the assumption that
it is disturbances rather than superposed fluctuations which are the main cause of the
irregularity, the element of unpredictability, in the data.

The fact that we get a worse and not a better estimate, although that estimate is
based on a larger number of variables, will naturally seem paradoxical to those who are
accustomed to the ordinary theory of correlation. It is simply due to the fact that we
have insisted on the regression equation being of a particular form, the coefficients of
U,—1 and u,-3 being identical, and the coefficient-of u,-, unity. The result tells us merely
that, if we insist on this, such and such values of the coefficients are the best, but even so
they cannot give as good a result as the equation of form (13) with only two terms on
the right.
