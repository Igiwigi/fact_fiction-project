It has already been seen that in dealing with a gravitating sphere of the size
of the earth it is necessary to take into account terms which are omitted by Lord
KeEtvin and others—the terms which introduce into our equations the gravitational
tendency to instability. It is of some importance to know whether the existing solution for the vibrations
and displacements of the earth would be altered to an appreciable extent by the
inclusion of these terms. The general frequency-equation which is given on p. 167 is
too complicated for manipulation, and is, moreover, open to the objection that it does
not represent the facts of the case; for, inside the earth, the strains caused by
permanent gravitation cannot legitimately be treated as small. +

§ 32. Considerations of a general nature will, however, give us some insight into
the question. In an imaginary earth, in which \, » are infinitely great, the
gravitational terms will be of no importance in comparison with those representing
the elastic stresses.
