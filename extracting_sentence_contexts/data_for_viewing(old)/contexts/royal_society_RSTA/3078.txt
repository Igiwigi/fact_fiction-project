transmission is characterized by climate-related events or processes that become more than the sum of their individual parts
because of their systematic nature across time and/or space. (Online version in colour.)

these transmission mechanisms, uncertainty about the scale of impacts can be reduced through
greater understanding of the biological and physical processes of risk transmission.

Our second class of climatic risk transmission mechanism is associated with real or perceived
resource limitations, including where climate impacts are anticipated rather than realized. This
category, which is a form of social amplification of risk, recognizes that the response to climate
trends and events can often have greater consequences than the first-order climate impact itself.
These transmission mechanisms typically occur across geographical scales and borders and are
embedded in competition for resources and economic and political institutions. We refer to this
as resource-generated transmission (usually amplification), in recognition of the fact that it is
the scarcity of resource, or at least perception of its scarcity, that is the principal reason for the
propagation of risk. This transmission mechanism is, therefore, characterized by amplification of
risks through the social systems where those risks are ultimately manifest. Resource-generated
amplification may occur because of prior systemic risk (e.g. where food systems are failing to
deliver food security), or they may be dominated by the aggregate response to the climate risk, or
even action anticipating real or perceived risk.

It is important to note that the typology is about risk transmissionâ€”not risk per se. The domain
of our analysis pertains entirely to climatic risk transmission and the manner in which it plays
out in various ways across the globe.

In the two classes described above, we distinguish mechanisms where climate is, and is not,
