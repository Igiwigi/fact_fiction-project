instead of from the ground, as we
have supposed, then the numerical value of ¢ would have to be divided by four. Reasons have already been given (Part VII.) for supposing that ¢ derived in this
way from cumulus clouds is a measure of frictional effects, but not of the diffusion of
entropy, because the linear term in (Part V., 3) does not vanish on taking the mean,
owing to the fact that the eddies are produced by variations of entropy. To put it in
another way: In G. I. Taytor’s deduction of formula (1) the vertical gradient of the
diffusing quantity is treated as not correlated with the vertical velocity. When we
are dealing with cumulus clouds that assumption is probably justified if the diffusing
quantity is horizontal velocity, but not if it is potential temperature.
