After this brief notice of the structure of the metapodium in the fossil Paridigitata,
we may proceed with the description of the same parts in Diplopus and Hyopotamus ;
but 1 wish, before doing s0, to take a short suryey of the same part of the ske-

leton in the remaining living representatives of the Paridigitate series, the Suidz and

The general conclusion to be drawn from our suryey of the fossil forms, is that
