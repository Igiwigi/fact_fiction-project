S We have thus far discussed, in some detail, the arrangement adopted in our experi-

ts on the question of the assimilation of free Nitrogen by plants, and the colla-
R points involved in the relation of gaseous Nitrogen to vegetation. In regard to
the latter, we have dwelt particularly on those which relate to the sources of avail-
able Nitrogen to plants, and which, therefore, may tend to influence the quantitative
results which we may obtain by the methods of experimenting followed. It remains
to consider what are the cireumstances under which it is most probable that free
Nitrogen may be assimilated, provided the assimilation can take place at all.

The demonstration of the fact, that the process of cell-development could go on in
the presence of free Nitrogen without the latter becoming incorporated into. the cell
wall, or into the contents of the cell, as a nitrogenous compound, would not carry with
It the demonstration that free Nitrogen could, under no conditions of growth, undergo
much change. Our aim should be, therefore, to scek the most probable cireumstances
