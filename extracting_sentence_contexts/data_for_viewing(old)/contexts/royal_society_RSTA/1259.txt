fact we need stronger assumptions on the evolution family and obtain non-optimal asymptotic
dependence of the constant), but this approach has the merit that it can be extended to
random Co-evolution families of contractions. To the best of our knowledge, for this setting no
maximal L?-estimates of the form (4.1) in 2-smooth spaces are available in the literature. For
stochastic evolution equations with random coefficients in Hilbert spaces subject to monotonicity
conditions, L?-maximal inequalities go back to [51,52]; for an exposition and further reference see
[53]. Some extensions to the case p # 2 have been obtained recently in [61].

In order to avoid technicalities that would obscure the line of argument we present our main
results for non-random evolution families and indicate the changes that have to be made in the 2-
dependent case in Remark 5.8. Rather than discussing the maximal L?-inequality in [60] in detail,
we will provide a detailed proof of a Gaussian tail estimate. The rationale of this choice is that
this estimate cannot be deduced (e.g. via Lemma 4.3) from the result of [60] due to the fact that it
does not provide the correct order O(,/p) of the constant. The result presented here is new, in that


it generalizes [58, Theorem 1.2] to arbitrary 2-smooth Banach spaces. A further novel feature of
our result is that it gives an improved bound on the variance.
As in [16,58] the idea is to apply It6’s formula to h, : X — [0, 00) given by
