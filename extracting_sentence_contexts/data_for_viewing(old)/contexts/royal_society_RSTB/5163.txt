fig. 187) plate 2b of area 4 has been separated from the unpaired plate by 2a. Still,
plate 2a is larger than plate 2b, and must have appeared after 2b, for in the case of the

succeeding plates, those in column 6 precede the corresponding ones in column a.
Assuming that the large plate in area 1 is plate 2b only (not plate 2a ++ plate 2b as
indicated by Lovin), it also displaces plate 2a.

The suggestion that no fusion of plates takes place is only tentative, and may not be
true. he difference existing between areas 1 and 4 (see fig. 5) cannot be due entirely
to the fact that area 4 is bounded on either side by two ambulacral columns belonging
to the second series—namely, IVb and Va—while area 1 is bounded by one column (Id)
of the second series and one (IIa) of the first series. The difference between the two
series of ambulacral columns is slight, and would not alter the inter-ambulacral plates to
a very marked extent. This is clearly seen in the case of areas 2 and 3 (fig. 5). Here2a
is bounded by two columns (IIb and IIa) belonging to the second series, while area 3
is bounded by two columns (III and IVa) of the first series. The asymmetry must be
largely due to the arrangement of the inter-ambulacral plates themselves. The reversion.
of either area 3 or area 2 (Holaster) results in corresponding columns being next the
anterior ambulacrum, and these areas are therefore symmetrical about the antero-
posterior axis (fig. 5). Where either area 1 or area 4 is also reversed, the plates are
symmetrical about the same axis, and the slight difference between the two areas is
confined to the plates nearest the peristome (see Lovin, 1874, Plates XXII and XXIII).
