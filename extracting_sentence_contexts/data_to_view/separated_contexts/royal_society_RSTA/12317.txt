Lastly, if the elliptic tides are unknown, « = B= 1, a = B’ = 45.

§ 4. Reference to Transit of Fictitious Moon. Suppose that there is a fictitious satellite whose R. A. is equal to the Moon’s
longitude, and let 2, h® be the R. A. of the fictitious moon and of the mean sun at
2 noon of the day under consideration, and let 7 be the mean solar time of the fictitious
5 moon’s transit.

8 Then at transit
in t+h—l=gqr,

3 where g is even for upper and odd for lower transit.
