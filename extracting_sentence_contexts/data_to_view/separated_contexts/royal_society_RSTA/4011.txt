Moreover, ¢m
reported in this work is rather lower than that previously reported in PBLZST ceramic (approx.
4200), a phenomenon that may have been brought about by a number of factors, such as smaller
grain size, formation of a ‘dead layer’ between film and substrate, internal stresses and substrate
clamping. If the thickness of the film further increases, it could be expected that tetragonal phase
would dominate in the film and ¢m of the film would be close to that of the bulk material. Notwithstanding this fact, ¢m and the corresponding temperature (Tm) are clearly film thickness-
dependent, as can be seen in figure 4b, suggesting that both values are dictated by Fr and Fy. The
value of Tm shifts to higher temperature with the film thickness due to the increase of tetragonal
phase, as shown in figure 3. The ém values do not vary monotonically with film thickness, which
is suggestive that the ‘dead layer’ does not contribute significantly to PBLZST thin-film dielectric
response.
