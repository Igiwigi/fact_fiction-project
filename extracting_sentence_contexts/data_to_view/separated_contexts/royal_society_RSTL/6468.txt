Take the principal axes at the fixed point as the axes of coordinates. Let v,, v,, v, be
the components of the yelocity V, and f., f,, f. those of the acceleration P of a particle
(z, y, 2) of mass m. We have seen that the fact of the acceleration being the complete differential coeffi-
cient of the yelocity leads at once to the three following equations :—

Putting then for brevity's 8ake f; for v,o,—0,w.,, f;, for v,o.,—v,s,, f' for v,o,—v,,,
we have

Now the sum of the moments of the moving forces about Oz equals

Let us first investigate the expression Em (5 y—=W s)- Evidently

And as the axes move with the body, a, y, z do not vary with the time, and we there-
