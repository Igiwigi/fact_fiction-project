This very
popular approach, however, unfortunately turned out to be superficial, because
it was applied with oversimplified generality instead of being based on sound
characterization of each specific phenomenon (Kolata 1977; Zahler & Sussmann
1977); see also Scheffer et al. (2009) for recent progress on tipping points and
critical transitions. Catastrophe theory can be included in the more general theory of bifurcations,
which describes how a variation in some parameter values results in a sudden
change in the qualitative structure of the solutions to dynamical systems. In
fact, catastrophe theory is related to the essence of bifurcations specific to
dynamical systems with potential. Presently, there are several advanced theorems
on bifurcations, some of which can explain even the emergence of chaos through a
universal route with successive period-doubling bifurcations (Feigenbaum 1978). Chaos is a mathematical term that describes complex behaviour in
deterministic dynamical systems, which has short-term predictability but is
nevertheless unstable and unpredictable in the long term.
