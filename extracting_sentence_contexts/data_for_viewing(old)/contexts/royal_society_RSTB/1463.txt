It has been shown that in all probability the blood splits up aldoxime into nitrous
acid and aldehyde. Should the blood in this respect fail or be too tardy in its action,
there still remains the likelihood that in the interaction between living tissues and

chemical bodies theve is a disseverance of a more complex molecule into its compon
and simpler molecules. The question resolves itself into the nature of the affiniti
between tissue cells and their mutual surroundings, in fact into the life processes
cells. In any case it seems more scientific in investigating the physiological action
any complex chemical body to look rather for a combination of the ascertained actions
of its component parts, than endeavour to pourtray any action peculiar to the whol
With this object it will be well now to reiterate succinctly the physiological actions
attributable to aldoxime, and while so doing to judge how far they reflect the com-
bined actions of a nitrite and of aldehyde.
Muscle.—It was found that aldoxime depressed the irritability of voluntary
muscle, and that, in some few experiments, there was a suspicion of a very transient
primary stimulation. This depressant action is also possessed by nitrites and by
aldehyde, Aldehyde has also a primary stimulant action, but this, in the aldoxime
molecule, may be antagonized by the oxime group.
Strong solutions of aldoxime diminish the extensibility and elasticity of muscle,
