they enter into this chamber. In this particular the Chlorzemea fall in with the rule
which prevails without exception throughout the great group of the Errant Annelides.
Recognizing the parallel tubes (A5 and Ff;, and Bb) as the true segmental organs, and
remembering the demonstrated facts, that at one time the germinal products are actually
to be seen within these tubes, and that at another they hang in masses externally around
them, the truth of the proposition contended for in this memoir is established, that the
segmental organs are in the female the true ovaria, and in the male the true testes.
But careful homological study'is required, in order to convince one's self that the primary
and secondary looped tubes of the Chlorzemea are in truth the morphological representa-
tives of the ciliated segmental tubes of the Nereid families. In the Chloremea these
tubes are not ciliated, either within or without. This is a distinctive peculiarity, which
allies them with those of the Hirudinei. But they stand alone and without example
amongst the other Annelids in this feature, viz. that the 7hree looped organs (ff e, A)
on either side are connected together by means of intermediate tubes. The anatomical
conditions in the male (B) and the female (A) are precisely the same. The same
description applies to both.
