In the actual implementation of Vedovato et al. [21], the interferometer begins and terminates at the MLRO,
extending up to the target satellite, and the measurement choice performed on the ground is space-like separated from the
photon reflection at the satellite. In his idea, depicted in figure 3, a photon enters an interferometer that can be arranged
according to two alternative configurations. If the interferometer is closed, one can observe
an interference pattern, reflecting the fact that the photon travelled both routes at the same
time, as a classical wave. If the interferometer is left open, then the two detectors show a
flat probability distribution in the recorded clicks, reflecting the fact that the photon travelled
along only one arm of the interferometer, as a classical particle. The mutual exclusivity of
the two experimental arrangements needed for observing the two complementary behaviours
allows one to consider the photon to be either a wave or a particle at any moment of the
experiment.
