Since s(t) = ¢s1(t/e) is rapidly oscillating, we expect the particle to move primarily in the normal
direction to the surface, i.e. along one of the curves from the normal family. If the particle were
actually constrained a normal curve, the centripetal force of constraint would arise, namely kv?N,
with the average k(v2)N over the period e. Now let us remove our non-existent constraint, and
thus the centripetal force; the released particle then should behave as if the opposite force —k( v2)N
were acting on it. This explains the last term in (5.5).

There is an striking contrast between the brevity of the above heuristic argument and the much
greater length of a rigorous proof of (5.3) (found in [25]). The heuristic argument also reveals a
geometric aspect of the averaged equations obtained by a formal argument. This geometric form
looks quite different from (5.3), and it is not clear how the geometric significance of these averaged
equations could be discovered by other means. In fact, the geometrical form (5.3) of the averaged
equations was arrived at before the rigorous proof of it was given in [25]. It would be of interest
to convert the heuristic argument into a rigorous proof, thereby replacing the normal form-based
argument in which the underlying geometry remains hidden.

(ii) An illustration

Consider the time-dependent surface with a ‘vibrating bump’, as shown in figure 8. According to
the above, the effect of this vibration is to create a potential well, i.e. an effective force attracting
to a potential minimum inside the vibrating patch.
