Introduction

Antiferroelectric lead lanthanum zirconate stannate
titanate (Pb,La)(Zr,Sn,Ti) (PLZST) compositions near
the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) have been
widely considered for a wide range of applications,

such as displacement transducers, pyroelectric detectors, piezoelectric actuators, etc. [1-11]. This
has been due to the fact that the ferroelectric phase may be induced in these compositions
by application of an electric field or stress or by varying the temperature, which brings
about large strain and pyroelectric coefficient [1-7]. However, MPB PLZST compositions are
characterized by large electrical hysteresis and high phase transition temperature, which may
limit their uses for some applications. Several attempts have been made to overcome these
limitations by introducing dopants within the PLZST lattice.
