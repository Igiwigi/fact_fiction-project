The quantity of air dragged by the two separate portions of a rod (whether
it be actually divided, as in the present case, or a portion of its influence on
the cireumambient atmosphere be interrupted and destroyed, as in the case of
the discs in the 18th and 19th sets of experiments,) as well as the distance of

their centre of gyration from the axis of suspension, have been computed
agreeably to the following formulze, which have been obligingly furnished me
by Professor Airy ®.

« Let r denote the weight of adhesive air dragged by one inch of the rod

* (equal, in the present cases, to _ of the whole quantity dragged by these

* rods as found in the 13th set of experiments) ; and let us suppose that any
* one rod begins at @ inches from the axis of motion, and ends at y inches
« from the same axis: then will the effect of the air adhering to that rod be

© represented by J (4* — a®). This is the same as if the whole quantity of

«air, »(y — 2), had been attached at the distance \ LES ;
* fact, is the distance of the centre of gyration of that rod from the axis of
© motion. The effect of the air adhering to several such rods will be repre-

* rupted piece from end to end of the given pendulum, will be as - E (4 — a5)
* to, _ (YY — X); where X and Y are the distances, from the knife edge, of

* the extremities of the whole rod: whence, the weight of adhesive air, to be
* used in the formula (10), will be

« =r (Y=X) x (L=2) (11)

* And the distance of the centre of gyration, from the axis of motion, for a

þ 2 (ff —@) F
a= 3Z(y—a) (12)
* where, in each formula, z = 0 when the rod begins from the knife edgef.”

* I am indebted to Professor Airy not only for these and other formulz noticed in this paper, but
also for various hints and suggestions during the progress of the experiments; and in general for the
lively interest which he has taken in this inquiry : without which encouragement I certainly should
not have extended the subject to its present length. :

+ It is in this manner that T have computed the weight of adhesive air due not only to the spheres
in this set of experiments, but also to the cylinders and discs in the 17th, 18th, and 19th sets of
experiments,


A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM. 447

The yalnes above given are nearly (although not exactly) in proportion to the
cubes of the diameters: but, it is possible that some other element, at present
unknown, may affect the results; and indeed some portion of the air may adhere
to, or be dragged by the sides of the sphere.
