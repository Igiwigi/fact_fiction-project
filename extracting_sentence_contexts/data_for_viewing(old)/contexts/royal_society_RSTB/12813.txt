the case of negligible affinity of both SDFla receptors for
their ligand, the self-generated local gradient of SDFla under-
lying the placode is in fact too weak with respect to adhesive/
repulsive interactions and FGF10-related velocity components.
Conversely, too high SDFla internalization rates (e.g. an
increase of aâ€œ! to 0.09, which gives a34f = 0.9) do not strongly
change the evolution of the numerical simulations in figures 6
and 7. We can only note that the regions constituted by Cxcr4-
expressing cells result more stretched as in the case of too high
cell sensitivity to SDFla.

The embryonic formation of the zebrafish PLL is a phenomenon
of particular interest in developmental biology. It in fact allows
us to shed lights on several mechanisms and _ processes
underlying chemically induced collective movement and
organization. PLL morphogenesis involves the migration of a
primordium formed by epithelial cells with mesenchymal
characteristics, which undergo cyclical phenotypic differen-
tiations resulting in the assembly and deposition of rosette-like
structures (i.e. progenitor of neuromast sensory organs).

In the present work, this phenomenon has_ been
approached from a modelling perspective by proposing a
discrete model with hybrid characteristics. Cells were
represented by interacting particles moving according to
