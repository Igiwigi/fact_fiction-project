On the whole, the trabecule, or interocular tracts, chondrify first ; then the inter-
auditory, or parachordals; and, lastly, the internasal, or fore ends of the trabecule. The development of true (arrested) vertebrae in the head is possible as far as the
three essential elements go, namely, the notochord and its pair of investing mesoblastic
tracts. As a fact, such segments, even below the hind brain, are imperfect and transient ;
under the other two vesicles they are impossible, and in the early embryo only slight
traces of somatomic division can be seen, even in the region of the hind brain. * Journ, of Anat. and Phys, vol. x. plate 24.


OF THE SKULL IN THE URODELOUS AMPHIBIA. 593

We now come to two causes of modification of the basal plates that are very important,
namely, divarication of the paired tracts, and obstruction of the unpaired axis ; the latter
is the most important of the two.
