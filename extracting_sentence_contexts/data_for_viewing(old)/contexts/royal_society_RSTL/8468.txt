and less resorted to by the larger animals ?

Some doubt must always attach tg the determination of the relative antiquity of the
cave-remains, owing to the several possible causes of disturbance, whether by physical
operations which rearranged the contents of the caye, or by the agency of animals or of
man producing local displacements. Tt is well known that fragments and pebbles of an
older stalagmite floor are sometimes found in the beds below the existing compact sta-
lagmite now forming the floor, and also that portions of an old stalagmite floor are some-
times found attached to the sides of the cave in a higher position than the existing bed
of stalagmite. SCHMERLING, in his account of the caves of the neighbourhood of Licge,
dexcribes several instances of the former, and the latter your Reporter has noticed in
the celebrated © Grotte D'Arcy,” near Auxerre. Tn this case the under surface of the:
stalagmite was coated with pebbles. Mr. PexGgLLY records precisely similar facts as
part of the phenomena of the Brixham Cave. Now it is evident that this could not
have taken place without a large remodelling of the contents of the caves. In the firs

place, the cayes were filled to a much greater height than at present with shingle, and
this shingle was directly covered by a bed of stalagmite. To have broken up this bed,
to have removed part, or lowered the whole mass, of shingle, and to have worn the
broken fragments of the stalagmite into pebbles, indicates a considerable disturbance,
such as, if any organic remains existed in that portion of the bed which was 80 disturbed,
would have removed them from their original position, and subjected them to more or less

* This cireumstance tends to give a greater antiquity to a portion of the smaller remains than from their
condition and position we might baye been disposed to assign to them.
