B, B. Morierei. View of the cone taken from LiGNIERâ€™s
description (1894). :

Judging from the ordinary type of Bennettites cone the fact that the seeds are all
cut transversely would make it appear as though the sections must have been cut
tangentially to the surface of the cone, but the longitudinal sections of the stalks show
the impossibility of this. Taking into consideration all the structures revealed by the
sections, it is clear that the transverse series is really transverse to the cone. As the
stalks were all running nearly vertical and the seeds all standing upright, we must be
dealing with the top of the cone, which, as WIELAND (1906) showed, is the only place
where the seed-stalks are vertical and the seeds upright.
