It is of course tempting to attribute
these different outcomes to the spatial/non-spatial nature of
the two discrimination tasks, given the prominent role in
spatial information processing attributed to the hippo-
campus. However, it is also important to point out that
these GluN14?°4! mice are perfectly capable of very high
levels of spatial memory performance (figure 1). In fact,
their performance on the standard, open-field version of the
Morris watermaze task was as good, if not better, than that
of the controls (see fig. 3 of [12]). Thus, although spatial reversal is exquisitely sensitive to
hippocampal NMDAR ablation, this is not the case for spatial
acquisition. We have observed a similar pattern of results
with GluN14?°™! mice in the classic, open-field version of
the watermaze task.
