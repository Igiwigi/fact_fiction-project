This effect was attributed to the dimension of the
water domain. The structure which is probably the least described among the SASs based on MG and
PL is the reversed microemulsion. However, owing to its low viscosity and the fact that food
systems contain not only surfactants but also oils, but this phase is also probably the most


promising in terms of food applications. It was used for solubilizing crystalline molecules such
as phytosterol [15]. Hoppel et al. [12] did in vitro experiment to study the permeation through the
skin of the anti-inflammatory molecule, diclofenac sodium.
