It will be understood that the lines throughout the diagram connect
experiments effected on gas of the same purity. The two lines low down on the diagram depict the first four series in which there
was very certainly a greater degree of impurity than in subsequent series. The
impurity consisting almost certainly of air, its effect will be to conceal the true varia-

tion of the specific heat with density ; and, in fact, the impurity has done so and even
reversed it ; less in the cases of III. and IV., than in I. and II. The next two series are higher on the diagram, and a well marked (probably
excessive) downward slope of the line is apparent. The lines connecting VI. and V., X.
and XIL., agree as regards the negative variation of the specitic heat with increased
density.
