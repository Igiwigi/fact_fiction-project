hornblende showing extensive “black”? resorption was found only in two rocks, non-
glassy intrusions of the nuclei of the Centre and Soufriére Hills. The “black”’ type of alteration was fully discussed by Washington in 1896. He
stressed the fact that these pseudomorphs are much more common in crystalline than
in glassy rocks, and concluded that the alteration is not due to reaction with the
magma, but takes place when the mineral becomes unstable under conditions of
diminished pressure, and slow cooling from a relatively high temperature (Washington
1896). The rocks of Montserrat provide much evidence in support of this hypothesis. For instance, in one slice the presence of a narrow rim of unaltered hornblende outside
a “black” core, suggests that the phenomenon is not due to magmatic reaction
(F 4428).
