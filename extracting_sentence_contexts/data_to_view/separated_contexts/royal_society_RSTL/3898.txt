I shall not here mention all the numbers obtained in the expe-
riments recently performed upon the proper current of the frog. I will merely say
that I followed up every one of the experiments on the muscular current referred to
in this memoir, with another experiment on the proper current, composing the pile
with the legs which remained after having prepared the frogs for the muscular cur-
rent. After s0 great a number of facts, I do not hesitate in repeating what I have
8aid in page 127 of my Treatise : © comparing one with the other the circumstances
which exert an influence over the muscular and over the proper current, they may be
said entirely to resemble one another, and that that which increases or weakens the
intensity of one of these currents, produces the same effect upon the other.” Two
points, however, still remain to be cleared up.
