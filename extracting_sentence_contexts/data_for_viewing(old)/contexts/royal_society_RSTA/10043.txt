We are therefore to look at the two remaining principal constituents, B,O, and
K,O, for the cause of variations in Cy.

Looking at Table VI., in which the glasses are arranged according to descending
order of magnitude of C,, we see that the four glasses with the high C, all contain a
percentage of B,O, which is considerable. On the other hand, the three glasses with
a low ©, all contain a comparatively high percentage of K,O. We conclude that
‘either B,O; raises Cy, or K,O lowers it, or both. Also, looking at 2783, which is the
Pwest of the seven, we notice that it contains the least percentage of B,O;, but not
fhe highest percentage of K,O. This suggests that B,O, is more efficient in raising
&, than K,O in lowering it. That the effect of B,O; must be predominant is other-
Wise evident from the fact that the order of the percentages of B,O, is the same as
fhe order of magnitude of C,, with one exception (1809).

§ The last column of Table VI. shows the values of (percentage of B,O;)—3 (percentage

@ K,O). This places 1809 in the sequence, but throws out 3749. Also the marked

Alifference between the four first and the three last is shown very clearly.

3 The glasses do not form a sufficiently regular series to enable us to go further and
determine exactly the law of dependence of C, upon the percentages of B,O; and

"gf K,O in the glass. But the increase of B,O, certainly increases C,, and the
