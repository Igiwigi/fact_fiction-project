the ring of the limbic lobe there lies another convolution which constitutes the
“gyrus marginalis” or edge of the mantle. This marginal convolution is well
developed in most animals and also in the Human embryo, but in adult Primates «
Whales is partially rudimentary inasmuch as it is represented in its dorsal porti
by the nerve of Lancisi only.
It consists of three segments, the fascia dentata Tarini (gyrus dentatus), gyru
supracallosus (“ Lancisi’schen Streifen” when atrophied, as in Man), and gyrus geniculi
(also included in the strize Lancisii in Man).
Just in the same way in which Broca’s speculative union into a great limbic lobe
of three lobes or portions of the great brain—lobus olfactorius, lobus hippocampi
lobus corporis callosi—falls to the ground when tested by comparative anatomy, §
also, is ZUCKERKANDL’s association of fascia dentata, nerve of Lancisi, and gy
geniculi, although attractive as a speculation, opposed to certain facts.
It is extremely desirable that the development of this region which surrounds the
foramen of Monro should he studied with such exactitude as would leave the question
quite beyond the reach of doubt. Failing precise embryological and especially histo-
genetical evidence I feel some unwillingness to refer to the subject at all, but lest it
shouid be supposed that I endorse ZucKERKANDI’s conclusion with regard to! ne
wider question, I feel bound to point out certain considerations which militate
his association of the fascia dentata, nerve of Lancisi, and gyrus geniculi in @
“marginal convolution.” These considerations may be best set forth after a state
ment of GIACOMINI's views.
