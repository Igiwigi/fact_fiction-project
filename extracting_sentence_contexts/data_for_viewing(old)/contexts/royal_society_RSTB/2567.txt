two races, one with a symbiont, and the other fungus-free. The macroscopic differ-
ences between the grains, as above described, accentuate this view. The susceptibility
to infection is probably not lost, however, unless the results of my graft experiments
are due to mere coincidence ; the long-continued difference might conceivably lead to
specific distinction. It must remain for future research to test this point ; as already
said, we may yet meet with some kind of spore-formation under special conditions, or

possibly some sort of sclerotium may be found to occur when circumstances favour the
fungus. Meanwhile, however, it seems preferable to keep speculation within the
bounds set by the observed facts.

Nature of the Fungus.

The nature of the fungus has been the subject of some speculation, but little direct
and positive evidence has been brought forward in proof of the various views.

The stated similarity of the physiological action of Darnel to that of “Taumel-
getreide” of Worontn has led some observers to refer both to similar causes.
NestTLeR suggests that one of the numerous hyphomycetous saprophytes which,
according to Woronrn, cause “ 'T'aumelroggen,” may be identical with the fungus of
Darnel. There is really no foundation for such a supposition other than the similarity
of physiological action, The life-histories, and the effects of the fungi on the grains,
