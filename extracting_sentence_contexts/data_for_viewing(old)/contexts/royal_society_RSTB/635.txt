pinched. On the opposite side voluntary motion was unimpaired, and the animal
was able to use its right leg freely and forcibly with perfect precision. There was,
however, absolute insensibility to every form of sensory stimulation, such as contact,
pinching of the toes and muscles, and a degree of heat which excited lively manifesta-
tions of uneasiness and pain in the left leg or in the hands. It was observed, also,
that though the animal could move its right leg for volitional purposes with perfect
precision when the eyes were open, it could not do so when the eyes were blindfolded,
being evidently unaware of the position of its leg, and unable to extricate it from any
obstruction. This, however, it readily effected when the eyes were freed.

“With the exception of certain statements made in reference to the muscular sense,
which will be considered more at length subsequently, the results of this experiment
agree with those obtained by Brown-Skquarp, and with the facts of disease or injury
of one-half of the spinal cord in Man, It has usually been found by other experi-
menters, and also in cases of unilateral disease of the cord, that on the side of lesion
there is a hypersensitiveness to sensory impressions, but this was not apparent in the
experiment above recorded. What the cause of this hyperzsthesia so frequently

of a lesion capable of inducing total anesthesia of the opposite side. It is probable,
