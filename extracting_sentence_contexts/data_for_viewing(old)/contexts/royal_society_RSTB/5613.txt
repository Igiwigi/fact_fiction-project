projection tract from the striatum and temporal lobe, “ voie motrice ou voie de projection
de l’écorce temporale.”” However, his description places its termination in the hypo-
thalamus rather than definitely in the subthalamus (Casax 1911, vol. 2, p. 721, fig. 462).

Further, no counterpart for the large paired nucleus of Platypus, dorsal to the anterior
commissure, in which the stria terminalis is embedded, has been described in mammals.

The Telencephalon.

The basal centres of the telencephalon, dominated by olfactory impulses in Platypus,
are simple structures compared with those of other closely related brains which have
received any degree of intensive study. Without doubt, this fact may be correlated
with the peculiarity of the life of a recluse, whose radius of activity is rather short and
who, in spite of water as a medium for food exploration, prefers general cutaneous sensi-
bility to olfactory stimulation. he olfactory bulb, although quite typical of mammals,
is also not noticeably enlarged. The region about its dorso-lateral fissure, which the
writer has identified as the accessory olfactory bulb, ELiior Smrru (1895) thought to
contain “the ganglion of Jacopson’s organ.” He found no differentiation either in
fibre or cellular content, peculiar to this area. McCorrer (1912) substantiated this
observation by finding in the accessory olfactory bulb of the opossum all those structures
characteristic of the distinctly olfactory portion of the bulb. Ramon y Cagau’s (1911)
description forthe rabbit, mouse and guinea-pig (figs. 428 and 429, pp. 671 and 672, vol. 2)
shows that a special bundle of fibres terminates within glomeruli, but that no true
mitral cells are present. Their places are taken rather by triangular and stellate cells.
