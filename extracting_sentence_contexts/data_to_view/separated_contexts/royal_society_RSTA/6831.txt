Broken line mutual inclination of cup bases and
gives h against r relation. clockwise rotation. Moreover, it appears that the h against r relation obtained experimentally is determined, ; |
in the case of a small degree of non-parallelism of the cup bases, by the mean separation of
these bases. Experiments illustrating this fact are described in ยง12. In making normal stress measurements on liquids of high viscosity, it was not found _ |
possible to adjust the cup bases to a sufficiently high degree of parallelism to eliminate com-
pletely the effects described above. This may be readily appreciated from the magnitude
of the effects shown in figure 5.
