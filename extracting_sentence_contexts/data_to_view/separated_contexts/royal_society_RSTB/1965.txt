On potato the gelatinous sheath
is also very evident, and gives to the growth its peculiarly viscous character, whereas
on peptone-gelatine, and on other solid media devoid of carbohydrates, the sheath is
much reduced or entirely wanting, and the growth is neither gelatinous nor viscous. Moreover the gelatinous sheath is a very evanescent character. It gradually dis-
appears with repeated cultures even on saccharose-gelatine, so that, after two or three
transfers, the colonies assume the form and size seen on peptone-gelatine ; the same
thing occurs in a primary culture (that is, one directly from the soil) if allowed to
remain undisturbed for two or three weeks or until the gelatine beneath the colony is
liquefied thoroughly ; and finally, as might be inferred from the latter fact, dilution
of the gelatine quickly brings about the solution and disappearance of the sheath. This process may be observed very readily in hanging-drop cultures in 10 per cent.
