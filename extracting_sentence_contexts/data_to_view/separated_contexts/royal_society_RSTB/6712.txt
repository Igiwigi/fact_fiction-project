Sometimes
there is more glassy residuum than in either of these rocks (F 4457), and in one specimen
a crystalline groundmass is unusually fine-grained and free from small micropheno-
crysts (F 4358). There are, however, many specimens showing better examples of the
primary tridymite that is so prevalent in rocks of these centres, and also in those of
Garibaldi Hill and St George’s Hill. It is a notable fact, to which reference will be
made later, that, in Montserrat, no pumiceous or highly porous rock was found to be
composed of pyroxene-bandaite without hornblende.

(iii) Olivine-basalts. The groundmass of the analysed basalts from near Shoe Rock
and O’Garra’s are representative of those of many specimens from South Soufriére
Hill. A few of the lavas collected have a rather coarser groundmass composed of basic
plagioclase, granular to prismatic augite, and iron ore (F 4348, 4352).
