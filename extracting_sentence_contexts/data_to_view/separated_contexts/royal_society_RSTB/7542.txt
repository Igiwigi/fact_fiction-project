Since the same receptors would presumably record a change
in the wind direction, if that were sufficiently sudden, the responses could, conceivably,
serve to orient the flying locust on the wind, but this is more conjectural. At present, there is no observational evidence that locusts do orient themselves to the
wind by such direct responses. The fact that the observed responses to wind changes were
less marked away from the ground, where the wind is stronger, than they were close to it
(p. 209), argues against direct responses to air movement participating in course and track
determination, however important they may be in securing stability in flight. Moreover, if
it is only the large-scale air eddies which are so shaped as to give the locusts pushes which
are biased in the wind direction, while between these the insects are subjected to more
numerous, randomly directed pushes, then it becomes very difficult to conceive how the
insect could utilize its aerodynamic sense organs for orientation to the wind. It is also
difficult to see, at present, how the same organs could be used, without confusion, for regu-
