541 nally i in terms of the coefficients of the given quintic equation and of the square root, of
the discriminant of this equation. In fact, » being arbitrary, write

L=IL;{v—6(s, B)}, M=11;{v—$(B, «)},
then the interchange of any two roots of the quintic produces merely an interchange of
the quantities L, M ; that is,
L+M and (L—M)=&(@,, #,, 4, #,, 3)
are each of them unaltered by the interchange of any two roots, and are consequently
expressible as rational functions of the coefficients; or observing that Z(,, z,, #;, w,, a)
is a multiple of RH D, we have La function of the form P+Qy/ D; the equation L=0,
Se roots whereof are v=$6(,, 3) . - . v=@(%, Bg), is consequently an equation of the
Frm P+QV/D=0, viz.
