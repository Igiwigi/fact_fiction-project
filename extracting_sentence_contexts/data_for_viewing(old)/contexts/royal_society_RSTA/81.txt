where F(p) denotes the local dynamics whose steady state is pp, and I" is the spatial domain
over which the kernel function g(r,r’) is defined. The term [ r8(t,r)p(r’) (assuming isotropy
and homogeneity it is more commonly expressed as g(|r — r’)) indicates that spatial interactions
positively affect (facilitation) the growth when g > 0, and the opposite (competition) happens
when g <0. Interaction kernels in these models typically exhibit the shape shown for the one-
dimensional case in figure 1a, and are thus positive at short scales and negative at long range.
In fact, the way the spatial structure emerges from equation (2.1) is easy to understand: small
perturbations larger than the homogeneous state, pg, tend to increase locally because of the
positive interaction with nearby points, whereas those with p < pp decrease in the interaction
neighbourhood. Thus, short-range facilitation enhances spatial heterogeneity and the long-range
inhibition (the negative part of the kernel) limits the indefinite growth of the perturbation.
A justification and deeper analysis of these type of kernels for vegetation models is given in
Borgogno et al. [15]. Biologically speaking, the facilitation range is usually assumed to be similar to
the crown radius, while the competition range is related to the lateral root length. While negative
vegetation densities are mathematically possible under these models, they are biologically
nonsensical. Therefore, works using kernel-based models usually set negative densities to zero
in numerical simulations [15].
