It is instructive to break down the shock heating into its constituent tensor components, where
each component is identified by ej; — (1/3)5iV - v (equation (3.9))—the possible ij pairs are xy, xx,
yy, xz, yz and zz (figure 4). The shock heating is mostly due to the spatial variation of the x and
y components of velocity in the azimuthal plane. Roughly, one-quarter of the heating is due to
changes in vy and vy with respect to z, and very little is contributed by the zz component.

Figure 5 shows the distribution of shock heating at the beginning of the instability (t= 95t,).
The shock heating is concentrated where the loop has kinked outwards against the external
potential field. The curved bands of figure 5, which are indicative of Petschek reconnection,
curve inwards towards the loop axis as one increases or decreases the z coordinate. Figure 5a
is symmetrical about y= 0; thus the top right quadrant is expanded so as to follow the shock
heating in more detail. There are in fact two thin bands of shock heating that appear to trace
the azimuthal magnetic field—between the two curved bands the shock heating is minimal. At
this time, there are no super-critical currents around the midplane: Ohmic dissipation is therefore
non-existent within figure 5.

If the dissipation of magnetic energy is responsible for the rise in shock heating then these two
events must be connected by the Lorentz force. At every time step, the Lorentz term is calculated
and used to update the velocity via the equation of motion. Shock heating might occur if such
