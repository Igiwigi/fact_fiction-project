curves being the values predicted by the lamina theory. The agreement in regard to
amplitude is very marked, but the observed phase angles are on the whole distinctly
higher than the theoretical phase. Apart from the fact that the departure of the lamina
theory from the truth is initially one of phase rather than of amplitude it must be
remembered that the effect of the finite width of the sheet becomes more pronounced
as the height increases. The effect is accounted for by a small diminution of the
in-phase component of the field due to the finite width of the return current path. For values of @ greater than 10, the lamina theory gives the simple result,

P/P, = 1/8.
