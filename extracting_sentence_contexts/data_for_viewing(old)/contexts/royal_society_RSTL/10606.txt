Byhole, the different grasses were very differently affected ; Leguminosw were generally
deficient; miscellaneous plants were in excess ; and, excepting with the nitrate, the
-Srrowth was much more characteristically leafy than stemmy.
EZ Third 8eas0n of separation, 1872.â€”The characters of the seasons intermediate
etween the separation-year of 1867 and that of 1872 undoubtedly exercisged con-
Siderable influence on the struggle from year to year. The firs of the four inter-
Snediate years gave very heavy produce, characterized by great stemminess and
Snaturity ; the second, again, gave very heavy produce, but characterised by great
Yuxuriance and leafy growbh ; the third yielded the smallest crop of the whole series,
Srematurely ripened ; the fourth was one of variable characters, giving more than
Swerage amounts of produce, with great unevenness of development of the plants. It
As obvious that these various conditions were calculated to influence the character and
FHegults of the struggle in very various ways; and, in the facts adduced, we have
Yllustrated in a striking manner how greatly the question is complicated by the
Silement of 8eason.
The season of 1872 itself was extremely changeable ; favourable for fair laxuriance,
Fput of very varying tendency to stem and seed formation, and to maturation, according
to the already established character of the herbage, and to the conditions of manuring
&upplied. There was generally less than average produce with deficient, and more
than average with high, manuring. By virtue of the characters of the four preceding
8easons, and egspecially of the two years of heat and drought, 1868 and 1870, the
distribution .of plants had become considerably modified. With deficient manuring
HFestuca ovina especially, but Agrostis vulgaris also, had much increased. With more
liberal manuring, when the nitrogen was supplied as ammonia, Dactylis glomerata and
Pon pratensis, and when as nitrate, Bromus mollis and Poa trivialis had become more
