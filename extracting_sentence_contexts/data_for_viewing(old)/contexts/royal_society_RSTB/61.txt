We have examined the Mammalian heart for the phenomenon in question both by
electrical and by mechanical methods. Deferring consideration of our results by the
galvanometer and electrometer, we here briefly give the results of our application of
a mechanical method, viz., application to the heart of a double myograph so as simul-
taneously to record the movements of its different parts. With regard to the
instrument, we need only say that it consisted of two levers, 1 to 8 em. apart, which
were applied to the excised heart just as in Arpy’s experiment they are applied to
voluntary muscle. It will be well to give separately (a) the results we obtained upon
the quiescent heart by excitation nearer to one or other of our levers; (b) the results
we obtained on spontaneously beating hearts.

(a.) Excitation of a quiescent heart, upon which rested the two levers of our double
cardiograph, at once revealed the fact that the total coordinated contraction of the

because we used mechanical stimuli. This was necessary, but did not give us the opportunity of taking
fine measurements of time, which indeed we did not require,
