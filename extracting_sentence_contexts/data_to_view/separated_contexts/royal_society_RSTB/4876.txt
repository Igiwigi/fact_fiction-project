When covered with oil
(usually cedar oil or oil of cloves—preferably the latter, as it is less troublesome to use),
the roughness of the surface is obliterated as effectually as if the chips had been ground
and polished. Examination under the microscope can be made with or without a
cover-glass, and as a rule no difficulty is found in using objectives up to ¢ inch (4 mm.). Even immersion-lenses up to ;4; inch (2 mm.) can be used in many cases if required,
and in fact a certain number of details of the Crustacean to be described were only noticed
in this way. The chips can also, of course, be mounted in balsam if desired, the balsam
naturally having the same effect as the oil in obliterating all traces of surface roughness. Incidentally, it may be mentioned that both in the work of searching for traces of the
Crustacean and in the elucidation of its structure, the use of a strong light is very helpful,
especially, of course, in the case of chips of any considerable thickness.
