respect of all permitted variations of the displacement w. This will be a ‘critical value’,
and in practice we are concerned to find the lowest critical value which is appropriate
to the specified distribution of 2, P,, S.

22. The problem can be treated by the methods developed in Part VI of this series,
but a new difficulty is presented in that usually the smallest critical load will be associated
with a mode characterized by nodal lines.* In consequence it is by no means easy (as
it was in Part VI) to guess with even fair approximation the form of this wanted mode:
the form, for example, of the surface of deflexion corresponding with uniform lateral
pressure is likely to approximate more nearly to one of the higher modes, and in that
event can lead to the required result only by ‘regression’ (Duncan & Lindsay 1939,

Regression in fact becomes an advantageous circumstance on which we would like
to count; but we know that it does not necessarily occur,—an assumption sufficiently
close to one of the higher modes may ‘tune up’ to that mode as we apply the standard
relaxation procedure. A like difficulty is to be anticipated in a relaxation treatment of
elastically supported struts: to meet it a technique is now suggested which dispenses,
in its early stages, with ‘liquidation’ performed with the aid of an exact relaxation
pattern, such as was employed in Part VII A of this series.

“Optimal synthesis’
23. The technique consists in a systematic ‘blending’ of two type solutions, each
of which satisfies the imposed boundary conditions, so as to make ) as small as possible. One of
these type solutions is a starting assumption (w,, say), the other (w,) is derived from it
by a standardized procedure.
