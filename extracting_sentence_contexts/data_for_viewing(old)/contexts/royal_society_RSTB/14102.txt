Â° Later-successional species showed similar seedling survi-

L have higher survival overall and are less sensitive to light
a 02 availability [24,49,50]. Moreover, seedling herbivory and
a subsequent mortality tend to be lower when comparing
01 later-successional to early-successional seedlings [29], likely

due to higher levels of secondary chemicals and mechanical
defenses [51]. These results, as well as the fact that recruit-
0 ment of later-successional seedlings in natural regeneration
AN PL plots was so low that we could not compare survival, are
consistent with past work of our group and others showing
that dispersal-limitation is stronger than establishment-
limitation for later-successional species in secondary tropical
forests, particularly for the many species with large,
animal-dispersed seeds [52-54].
We were surprised that the density of neither conspecific
nor heterospecific species was a significant explanatory
factor in our initial models, given that many studies have
