1. Introduction

In essence, all morphogenetic processes are the result of one or more self-
organized events governed by physical principles. This is illustrated by the
fact that a properly proportioned and physiologically active embryo, with all
its organs, can be generated from an externally fertilized egg. Identifying the
key features and understanding the underlying principles that guide specific
morphogenetic processes constitutes one of the major challenges in biology. The discovery of oscillations in simple chemical systems and the formal descrip-
tion of reactionâ€”diffusion processes paved the way for the understanding of the
physical principles governing many sub-cellular processes (reviewed in [1]).
