In two dimensions, analytical solutions exist for the effects of a concentrated
force acting either at or inside the boundary (cf. Love 1927, §§ 147-52) : using these we

can transform our problem into one which does not involve singularities, therefore is
more suited to the relaxation approach. The device was not in fact employed in any of
the problems of Part IIT, but in Part V (e.g. § 5) it was used to dispose of a logarithmic
infinity which was encountered in a problem of conformal transformation. Here its
application will entail more labour, since the analytical solutions are more complex ;
but its principles are unchanged whether the singularity is on or inside the boundary,
so do not call for further description here. Il.
