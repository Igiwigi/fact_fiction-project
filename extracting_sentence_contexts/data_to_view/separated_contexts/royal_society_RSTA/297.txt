The problems of hydroelasticity are
coupled, which implies that the elastic deformations of the body depend on the
aydrodynamic forces and vice versa. The problems of coupled fluid motion and
elastic deformations of a body in contact with the fluid are difficult to study both
heoretically and numerically. In particular, the difficulties are due to the fact that
he hydrodynamic forces acting on the surface of an elastic body depend strongly
