mechanism, when a piece of the posterior end of the primitive streak is substituted for the
primitive node in L stage blastoderms. Further discussion of doubling will be deferred in
view of this later work.

VI. TENDENCY TO REVERSED DEVELOPMENT

In this section are considered all those specimens which healed almost perfectly after
a reversal operation, and may be said to show some sign of development according to the
orientation of the reversed-piece. No tendency to such reversed development is found after
any control operation. To begin with there are three specimens whose final orientation,
in the region of the reversed-piece, is uncertain. They had undergone type III operations;
and the posterior region of the trunk is of uniformly poor differentiation, being devoid of
somitic mesoderm. This may conceivably be due to the fact that presumptive side-plate

had replaced presumptive somite, while the presumptive somite had been transferred too
far posteriorly to differentiate at the time of fixation.

Eight further specimens show a tendency to reversed development. In all of these a
large piece of the primitive streak was reversed.

In the sections of specimen no. 12 (type III operation at h.-p. stage; p.s. 2:0 mm., 71% of
a.p.l., h.-p. 0-25 mm.; 7.-p. 1-2 mm., 0-25 mm. back from anterior end of primitive streak)
