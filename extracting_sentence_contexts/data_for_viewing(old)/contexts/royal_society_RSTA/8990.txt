These three determinations are all independent.



DR. W. M. HICKS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF SPECTRAL SERIES. 443

Argon.—There are a large number of strong lines in the visible spectrum
evidently ‘connected with D(1) and F(2) lines. The oun is so small that the
qualifying test for D lines is not so definite as in the other gases, although this is to
some extent remedied by the fact that the measures on the whole are good with a
possible maximum error of ‘(02A. We shall therefore make no attempt to discuss the
F and D series with the same fullness as in the other cases. The groups selected are
certainly not the only ones and possibly may not be the most important ones, but
they will be sufficient to give data for the determination of the oun to about the
same degree of accuracy as for the other gases of this family. Take for the first

Group:
