is on or off in correct reflection of the peaks and valleys in the true GPi signal
dlack). In this example, the control reliability is 67 per cent. But the effect on
1e neuronal reliability in the TC cell, our goal, is not very impressive (there
are a few additional transmitted spikes in the controlled case, but also some
missed spikes).

131m real life, such model instability would not arise. So long as we stay within the safety limit of
the electrical stimulation, we might be able to deliver more GPi current to the TC cell. But the
reliability steadily decreases in this scenario as this type of additive DBS increases in the model,
as too much inhibition shuts off the TC cells. We find no inference that such open-loop stimulation
is going to be as effective as an intelligent adaptive approach as illustrated in figure 15a.

MT fact, Julier & Uhlmann (1997a) had an adjustable inflation parameter that they required to
tune their original unscented filter. As in so many of these recursive filter designs, there is a trade-off
between tracking accuracy versus stability with greater uncertainty. One also needs to counter the
tendency of these filters to recursively drive the uncertainty to zero, which ruins tracking ability.
