Again, the gangliated cords of invertebrates, which are formed from epiblast, are at
first developed as solid, uniform, and unconstricted columns, which only secondarily
become constricted and gangliated. A second reason in support of the view here
propounded is that we possess, in the gangliated cords of the sympathetic, bilaterally
symmetrical structures, placed along the bony axis of the trunk, in relation to the
main vascular and alimentary tubes. On the one hand, there is no evidence of strict
segmentation in the branches distributed peripherally from these cords ; and, on the
other hand, the parts over which they preside—the heart, blood-vessels, lungs,
intestinal tract, &e.—are all morphologically unsegmented, like other parts and organs
in the Mammalian trunk which are longitudinally placed. The cerebro-spinal axis,
the notochord, heart, vascular system, alimentary canal and diverticula, ureters, &c.,
present no signs of being developed in a segmental manner. In fact, it might be
formulated as a morphological law, to which the sympathetic cord is no exception—
that longitudinally-placed structures, whether single and median, or laterally placed,
are primarily and uniformly unsegmented.*

2. From the morphological point of view, however, the most important conclusions
derived from the investigations recorded above are undoubtedly the following :—

a. The independent origin of the sympathetic system, and its secondary connexion
with the cerebro-spinal system.

b. Its development from the mesoblast.
