Introduction

Once the very fundamental laws of nature are conceivably exactly the same
for any process, why do we divide physics into great areas such as cosmology,
statistical mechanics, condensed matter, atomic and molecular physics, high-
energy physics, etc.? The answer, to a large extent, relies on the type of
methodology, concepts and principles adopted to explain and comprehend a
yarticular phenomenon. In fact, the specific framework considered to treat a
system is closely related to its resulting collective interactions and the amount and
degree of organization of matter, which are the aspects setting the characteristic
scales of energy, size and time. For instance, generally we do not start with the
strong force (responsible for maintaining the atomic nucleus together) to discuss
he chemical properties of the atomic elements. We rather consider the nuclei as
‘given’ structures of positive charges and then analyse their interaction with the
electrons through the electromagnetic force.
