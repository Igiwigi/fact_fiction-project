to within the 8-inch length under test.* The yield-point, with this specimen, has,
therefore, coincided with the elastic limit as accurately as the extensometer can
measure. Usually, in testing, imperfection of elasticity is shown before the yield-
point is reached, and if a load less than that at the yield-point be allowed to act for
some time, then a slight creeping probably supervenes. When, however, a bar, like
that referred to above, has shown very perfect elasticity up to the yield-point, it is
probable that a load very little under that at which the yield-point oceurs could be
sustained for an indefinite time without creeping taking place. Even although
slight imperfection of elasticity be shown before the yield-point, experiments showed
that no creeping need necessarily occur for a pause in the loading of at least a night’s
duration.

* The fact that yielding takes some time to start has already been recorded by Professor EWING in his
paper cited above, “On Measurements of Small Strains, &e.” (see pp. 135 and 136), He has noticed that
yielding may begin in a part of the bar lying outside the 8-inch length to which the extensometer is
applied, and may gradually spread along the bar.

The manner in which yielding under a constant load proceeds after the yield-point
has just been passed is often very irregular. The curves given on Diagram II. illus-
trate this yielding with time for two entirely different specimens. The first shows
the creeping referred to above as having started 4 minutes after the application of the
load which was its cause. The second curve shows a larger yielding of much longer
