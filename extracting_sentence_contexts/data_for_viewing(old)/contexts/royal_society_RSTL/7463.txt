I. 4 Supplementary Memoir on Caustics. By A. Cavuey, F.R.S.
Received November 15,—Read November 22, 1866.

Tr is near the conclusion of my © Memoir on Caustics,” Philosophical Transactions,

yol. exlvii. (1857), pp. 273-312, remarked that for the case of parallel rays refracted at

a circle, the ordinary construction for the secondary caustic cannot be made use of (the
a entire curve would in fact pass off to an infinite distance), and that the simplest course
A is to measure off the distance GQ from a line through the centre of the refracting circle
E perpendicular to the direction of the incident rays. 'The particular secondary caustic,
Z or orthogonal trajectory of the refracted rays, obtained on the aboye supposition was
= shown to be a curve of the order 8; and it was further shown (by consideration of the
S case wherein the distance GQ is measured off from an arbitrary line perpendicular to
S the incident rays) that the general secondary caustic or orthogonal trajectory of the
Z refracted rays was a curye of the same order 8. The last-mentioned curve in the case
= of reflexion, or for p=—1, degenerates into a curve of the order 6; and I propose in
& the present supplementary memoir to discuss this sextic curve, viz. the sextic curve
Z which is the general secondary caustic or orthogonal trajectory of parallel rays reflected
S at a circle.
