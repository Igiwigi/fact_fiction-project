similar changes in the laboratory of the chemist, even if the facts to which I have
had occasion to refer had not been experimentally ascertained ; but these facts, bear-
ing more directly on the question, necessarily make a stronger impression. Let us for a moment glance at those phenomena in which we are assured that no
inanimate agent interferes. It is evident that the organs to which impressions made
on the neryes are conveyed, must be those organs from which the nerves in question
originate and derive their power.
