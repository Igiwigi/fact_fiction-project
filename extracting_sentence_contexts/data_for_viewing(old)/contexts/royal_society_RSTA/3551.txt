Even when grown on single-crystal substrates, passive films have a_ polycrystalline
microstructure with grains of nanometric lateral dimensions. On nickel, the lateral dimensions
of the crystalline grains determined from the morphology observed by STM and AFM have been
reported to range from approximately 2nm in the initial stages of two-dimensional growth to
30 to 230 nm for three-dimensional films in stationary conditions of passivity [10,11,23,26,30,58].
A large dispersion could be found on the same sample. A lower average value of approximately
8nm for the NiO(111) single-crystal domain size was derived from GIXD data obtained on
passivated Ni(111) surfaces [27,30]. This difference can be assigned to the fact that STM and AFM
measurements are unable to resolve the multiple twin or subgrain boundaries that may exist in
the passive film if they do not markedly emerge at the topmost surface of the film.

The grain boundaries separating the oxide grains play a key role in the breakdown of passivity
and the initiation of localized corrosion as revealed by STM and AFM studies performed on
well-defined substrate surfaces [58-62]. These nanostructure defects act as preferential sites for
passivity breakdown and pit initiation both without and with aggressive anions (Cl~) present in
the electrolyte. This is illustrated in figure 4 for passivated Ni(111) surfaces [58,60]. After pre-
passivation in a chloride-free sulfuric acid solution (pH 2.9) in the lower part of the passive
domain (0.55 V/SHE), the surface is completely covered by the polycrystalline passive film
(figure 4a). This pre-passivated surface corrodes locally with the formation of nanopits when the
potential is increased (up to 1.05 V/SHE) in the passive range. In the absence of chlorides, the
