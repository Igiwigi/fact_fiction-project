A, dense groups appear on the internal aspect, of the lobe just where it becomes super-
ficial, but between this and the crucial 8uleus the cells are scattered in distant groups,
and average in 8ize 37 X 16p. These densely-grouped confluent nests may be traced
down along the whole internal aspect of the anterior are of the limbic lobe as far
forwards as the sub-frontal sulens. In the divisions marked A C great fusiform cells
are frequently met with measuring 55p long Xx 13p in diameter, or 69p X 11p, In
entering thus somewhat minutely into the details of examination of an important
region of the cortex, I have been influenced by the desire of pointing out what may
prove a significant fact : that these groups of ganglionic cells do not form an equably
distributed layer, but are associated in dense masses towards various centres with
intervening tracts formed by distant or discrete cell groupings. The remaining portion
of the convolution of the corpus callosum, viz. : that part lying beneath the $ub-parietal
s4lcus and limited posteriorly by the retro-limbic annectant, presents us with the most
perfect example of the six-laminated cortex and solitary arrangement of ganglionic cells. The band of angular or pyramidal elements separating the third layer from the
ganglionic is both deep and dense.
