noted that the idea above already suggests for a new approach to the optimal regularity of
solutions to thin obstacle problem, with possible bearings to other problems, especially the
extension problems.

If the monotonicity function above could be more precise with exact value for 8, then
one would be able to have exact results for the optimal behaviour of the solutions in higher
dimensions. In [10], the authors introduce a monotonicity function which is considered only in Bf
and uses strongly the almost-convexity properties of the set {u = 0}. The result in [10] states that

| (ux? sce, (3.5)

where u is the solution to the thin obstacle problem. This monotonicity result uses the fact that
the smallest eigenvalue, given by
