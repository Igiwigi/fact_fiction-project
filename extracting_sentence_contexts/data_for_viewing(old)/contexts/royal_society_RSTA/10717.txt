A glance at the complete curve for the variation of the specific heat of water with
temperature reveals at once a most interesting relation. Why should the values
drop so rapidly from the freezing point and at 87°°5 the complete character of the
curve change? There is no discontinuous or sudden change occurring at this point
that is indicated either in the outward physical state or in the density of the water,
nor do we see any connection between the curious anomaly in the density curve at
4° C. and the specific heat at that point. It is evident we have to do here with a
new, and as yet unexplained, phenomenon.

The ideas advanced by Row1anp in this connection are not, it seems to me,
altogether correct when he says :—‘“ However remarkable the fact may be, being the
first instance of the decrease of the specific heat with rise of temperature, it is no
more remarkable than the contraction of water to 4°. Indeed, in both cases the
water hardly seems to have recovered from freezing. The specific heat of melting
ice is infinite. Why is it necessary that the specific heat should instantly fall, and
then recover as the temperature rises? Is it not more natural to suppose that it
continues to fall even after the ice is melted, and then to rise again as the specific

heat approaches infinity at the boiling-point? And of all the bodies which we
should select as probably exhibiting this property, water is certainly the first.”
