and also referred to by Bulleid. The other trackways mentioned from the Polden-Wedmore
valley have very indefinite character or situation.

It will be shown that all the trackways investigated belong to one short period and are
strikingly related to the history of development of the peat bogs of the region.

2. MEARE HEATH TRACKWAY

(a) Situation and circumstances

Dr A. Bulleid, F.S.A., in 1933 published an account of the discovery of a prehistoric
trackway crossing Meare Heath (Bulleid 1933). The substantial and elaborate nature of
its construction, and the fact that it had not been datable by archaeological means, led
us to attempt its rediscovery, its relationship to the bog stratigraphy, and its dating by
> pollen-analytic methods.

Dr Bulleid described the line of the trackway with close accuracy and we were able to
confirm its presence along the line given by him, but far south of any exposures he had
seen. Acting upon advice given by the turf cutters we saw portions of the trackway close
to the boundary of Shapwick Heath next to the flank of the Polden Hills. The track was
nearly parallel with Nine Acre Drove, but 140 ft. eastward from it, and was exposed along
a distance of 1710 to 1820 ft. from Buscott Lane as measured along the length of the

extrapolated track. From this point the track runs directly about 26Â° east of north towards
