by which an extensive contact is secured between the blood-proper and the fluid of
the visceral cavity. 'This arrangement is $0 strikingly a provision for the attainment
of a, particular object that it cannot be misinterpreted. In the anatomy of the Nais
this is perfectly and beautifully seen. From the sub-ganglionic trunk long coiled
vessels proceed, describe several convolntions in the midst of the fluid, and in a
perfectly naked and unsupported state, curve dorsally, still surrounded by the ehyl-
aqueous fluid, and empty themselves into the great dorsal trunk. In Nais macu-
losa (Waws) this distribution of the coiled vessels is 8till more readily demon-
strated, in consequence of the bright red colour of the blood enabling the observer
to trace the minutest vessels throughout their entire course. With respect to these
vessels there is one remarkable fact to be stated, namely, that they maintain their
singleness or individuality from their point of origin to their termination ; they do
not branch. In this fact is seen a beautiful provision against injury during the
contractions and elongations of the body. The slender column of blood contained
in these vessels, is directly and throughout its whole course exposed to the agency of
the peritoneal or chylaqueous fluid. The agency of this fluid is obviously of a two-
fold character; it first replenishes the blood-proper with the chylous materials by
which its healthy constitution is maintained, in other words, the coiled vessels absorb a
chylous pabulum from the peritoneal fluid ; this process of chyle absorption may not
be exclusively confined to these vessels ; those distributed oyer the parietes of the
intestine may participate in this function ; and, secondly, the peritoneal fluid acting
as a reservoir for the oxygen of the external element, forms to the coiled vessels a true
arating medium, the process of breathing being thus internal. In its application
to the Fntozoa this view of the mechanism of respiration acquires the highest interest.
It is the true method of respiration in all Zntozoa. The physiologist will now I trust
