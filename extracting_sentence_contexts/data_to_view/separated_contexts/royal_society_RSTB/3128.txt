In the second place, both the clear space and the yolk nucleus of the older oocytes
have lost the regular form they possessed in earlier stages, and it is then frequently
seen that the outline of the clear space corresponds exactly with that of the yolk
nucleus, a correspondence which can only be explained by supposing that the two
surfaces were originally in contact and have been separated by shrinkage (fig. 38),
and is wholly incompatible with the supposition that the space is caused by an
accumulation of fluid material in the living egg. This interpretation of the space
as a split due to shrinkage is also supported by the presence, on the surface of the
yolk nucleus facing the space, of numerous frayed strands of cytoplasm (fig. 34). The extensive changes in the form and size of the yolk nucleus make it impossible
to ascertain by direct measurements, on acid fixed and sublimate fixed material from
the same individual, to what extent the shrinkage of the yolk nucleus is responsible
for the clear space; but the fact that there is no great difference in size between
yolk nuclei in oocytes of about the same age, the one accompanied, the other
unaccompanied, by a clear space, shows that this contraction cannot be a very
extensive one, and an explanation, other than the condition of the yolk nucleus, must
be found for the very large clear space often present. The explanation is given by
figs. 85 and 36 which clearly show that the contraction of the egg cytoplasm as
a whole may often be largely responsible for augmenting the size of the clear area.
