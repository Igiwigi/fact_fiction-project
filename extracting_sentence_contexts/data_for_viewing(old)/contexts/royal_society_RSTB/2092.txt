* Weiss (78), p. 398, speaks of the stomata on non-green parts behaving like normal ones.
Kont (86), pp. 39, 66, found, however, that certain stomata, devoid of chlorophyll, were almost
incapable of movement.

MR. FRANCIS DARWIN ON STOMATA. 543

§ 2. ChosurRE purING WirHeErina. .

The fact that in most plants the stomata close as the leaf withers has long been
known.

The following figures show the nature of the process. In this case the horn
hygroscope was placed on the leaf as soon as it was cut from the plant and left on
continuously ; this ensures that the readings are taken at absolutely the same part
of the leaf throughout. It is, however, inadmissible as a regular method since it
ultimately produces a permanent bend in the horn tongue of the machine.
