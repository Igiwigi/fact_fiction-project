As the narrow case formed by the wings thus
folded extends beyond the extremity of the abdomen, and
might easily slip off so convex and smooth a surface, such an
accident is guarded against by the contrivance already de-
scribed, namely, an apparatus of hairs or bristles placed on
either side of the upper surface of the last segment but one. The digestive organs.* It is mentioned in the 48th Letter
of Wuite's Natural History of Selborne, on the authority of
Anatomists who have examined the intestines of the mole-
cricket, that « from the number of its stomachs or maws,
there seems to be good reason to suppose that it ruminates,
or chews the cud like many quadrupeds.” A cursory view
of these parts however is enough to show, that such an opi-
nion could only have been deduced from some very general
points of resemblance, and the probability of its truth is
entirely destroyed upon an examination of their internal
structure. In fact, the digestive organs of this insect resemble more
closely those of a granivorus bird than of any other animal,
as will appear from the following description. The esophagus,
which on its upper side is blended with, and forms a conti-
nuation of the inner surface of the upper lip, commences on
the lower surface in a loose corrugated tongue, as it were,
which is attached at its base to the inner surface of the lower
lip; from hence it is continued along the under part of the
head and neck, and between the bony laminz of the sternum,

in the form of a distensible and longitudinally folded tube of
a reddish brown colour ; it then passes on among the muscles
of the two hind pair of legs, and at length terminates in a
very large crop of an oval form. In the vicinity of the
mouth it is surrounded by muscles which arise from its outer
coat, and are inserted at nearly right angles into the adja-
cent parts; these muscles of course serving to open and
distend it.
