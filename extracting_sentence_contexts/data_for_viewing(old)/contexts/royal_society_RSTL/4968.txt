Far., 80 that the question respecting the infiltration of solid matter with the water
absorbed by the envelopes of the eggs was not affected.

About four hundred and twenty eggs were employed in this set of experiments ; yet I
could not detect any granules of the colouring matter of carmine held in suspension,
and of dimensions equal to those of the spermatozoa, which had passed into the tissue
of the envelopes of the eggs, although they had become tinged by the colouring matter
in combination with the water. Abundance of granules of colouring matter of most
minute size, and not more than one-third the diameter of the spermatozoa of the
Frog seen beside them, adhered to the surface of the envelopes, and it was to these
chiefly that the red colour of the whole was due. Every part of the envelope exhi-
bited the same uniform appearance, the granules being pretty equally distributed over
the surface, and the suffusion of colour was uniform in the interior. These facts ap-
peared to be conelusive with reference to the question of the presumed existence of a
fissure or perforation through the coverings of the egg of the Frog before, or at the
moment of fecundation, as is supposed to exist in the ovum of the Rabbit. I have
not been able to detect any appearance of orifice or fissure in the egg of the Frog-
envelopes, and the course of which, if such really exists, would no doubt be indicated
by some deposition of the colouring matter of the carmine, to a greater or less ex-
tent, in its tract. The result of these experiments was thus most unfavourable to the
belief that the spermatozoa penetrate bodily through the membranes of the oyum ;
and to that of the supposed existence of a special opening in these membranes for
their admission.

I ought now, however, to mention one experiment that seemed to favour the opi-
