This is a species which I have called Tiaropsis polydiademata, and the response which it
gives to luminous stimulation is even more decided than is that which is given by Sarsid.
In the opening paragraphs of my former paper, I described a peculiar $pasmodic movement
that is performed by Sfaurophore laciniata when subjected to marginal stimulation of any
kind—a moyement quite distinct from the ordinary locomotor contractions. A. precisely
similar movement is exhibited under similar cixcumstances by 7iaropsis polydiademata,and
it is very interesting to observe that a sudden increase of light causes this peculiar 8pasm
in this 8pecies quite as invariably and quite as decidedly as does any other kind of sti-
mulation, Now in one remarkable particular this response to luminous stimulation on

bf the part of Tiaropsis polydiademata differs from that given by Sarsia tubulosa; and the
=] difference consists in the fact that while with Sarsia the period of latency is, 80 far as
E the eye can judge, as instantaneous in the case of response to luminous stimulation as
® it is in the case of response to any other kind of stimulation, such is far from being truc
S with Tiaropsis polydiademata, 'The period of latency in the last-named species is, 80 far
TY as the eye can judge, quite as instantaneous as it is in the case of Sarsia, when the

E spasm does not take place till slightly more than a second has elapsed after the first
