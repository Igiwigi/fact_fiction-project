attitude:

It is popular nowadays to say that morphogenesis (that is the development of form) is
programmed by the genes. I think that this statement, although in a sense true, is unhelpful.


Unless we understand how the program works, the statement gives us a false impression
that we understand something when we do not ... . One reason why we find it so hard to
understand the development of form may be that we do not make machines that develop:
often we understand biological phenomena only when we have invented machines with
similar properties ... and we do not make ‘embryo’ machines.

In fact, ‘understanding’ something means explaining it with a model that we are familiar with,
and a machine gives us an immediate sense of familiarity. When we see it working before our
eyes, we feel that we ‘know’ it. Actually, we do not even need to build a machine to get this
feeling. A description is enough, and so a machine is often a model, or an algorithm. One of the
most famous machines of all times was built by Turing with just pencil and paper.

Maynard Smith’s point, in other words, amounts to saying that to understand embryonic

development we need a model or an algorithm that allows us to understand, at least in principle, : =

Note that we do have a mathematical model that explains how a divergent increase in [3
complexity can take place. That model is provided by the equations of population genetics in : =
