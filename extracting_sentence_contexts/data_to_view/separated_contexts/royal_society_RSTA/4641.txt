An attempt was made to verify this volume relationship by means of
planimetric measurements of the relative areas of the light and dark constituents
of the eutectic as represented in some of the best defined of the photo-micrographs
reproduced in figs. 34, 35 and 36, but the results varied too widely to allow of any
satisfactory deduction. Consideration of the fact that the structure of the eutectic as
shown in these photographs frequently assumes the form of plates or rods of one
constituent embedded in the other at once serves to explain these variations ; in the
case of a bunch of parallel needles of the 8 body lying in a matrix of tin, the relative
areas of the cross-sections as seen in a micrograph would depend upon whether the
plane of the section ran parallel to or at right angles to the length of the needles. These variations are, of course, further accentuated by the fact that the eutectic
structure is always somewhat minute, so that the areas measured at any one time are
confined to a very minute portion of the actual alloy. Examples of the typical micro-structure of the lead-tin eutectic alloy are given in
figs.
