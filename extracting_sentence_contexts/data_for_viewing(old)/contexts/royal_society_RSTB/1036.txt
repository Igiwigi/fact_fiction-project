Beside the anterior and posterior overlaps, the cutaneous field of each posterior root
oversteps the median line of the body both ventrally and dorsally. This crosslap of right
and left-hand nerves is not so extensive as the overlap fore and aft. It is comparable
with the lapping across the dorsal median line of the distribution of the pilomotor
nerves in the Monkey and Cat as described by Lanairy and myself.t It seems to
vary in Macacus in different regions, It seems more marked along the mid-ventral
line than along the mid-dorsal line, and I have seen it remarkably extensive on the
penis, and close below the xiphoid. I do not think I have ever seen it amount to
more than a full centimetre in Macacus, but all the specimens have been small and the
crosslap might be larger in larger individuals. The amount of supply by the root
to the cross-lapping border of the field appears relatively small compared to elsewhere
in the field, in fact it resembles in this way the extreme border of the forelapping
and afterlapping portions of the skin-field.

Where seen at its simplest, viz., in the thoracic region, the shapet of the cutaneous
field of the posterior root is that of a horizontal band with fairly parallel edges
wrapping half round the body between the mid-dorsal and mid-ventral lines. In _
the lower half of the thorax each zone thus formed slopes somewhat, so that the
ventral end of it appears to lie further caudal than the dorsal end of it. Each zone is
narrowest at its dorsal end, and widest somewhere not far from its ventral end.
The width of the individual zones gives us some idea as to how the external configu-
ration of the body has been brought about. Where the body approaches a regular
figure, a cylinder, a double cone, &c., the root-field is zonal, possessing long anterior
and posterior sides fairly parallel each with the other, and short dorsal and ventral
