A contains only the quantities J, g, which are not the same in both systems ; and we may
therefore represent this matrix by (J, g), and the corresponding matrix with |, ', &', J', q/
by (7, 9). The two matrices are at once 8een to be convertible (the assumed relations
k':bV:d=h:b: ec correspond in fact to the conditions, a'—@': U': &=a—d: 6: 0c, of con-
vertibility for the ordinary form), and the compound matrix is found to be

(= (a+0) IJ, a+1):

And in like manner the several convertible matrices (JT, 9), (T', ), (J", 9") &c. give
the compound matrix
