entanglement (a word one of us never heard during his entire student lifetime!), the no-cloning
theorem and further basic concepts of what became a new science: quantum information science.

Today, quantum information is a well-established field. Entire journals are devoted to it. The
big ones (Physical Review Letters, Nature, Science) are eager to publish the findings. Every country
has some laboratories devoted to it and universities compete to attract the best players. Even large
(and some smaller) companies advertise to hire specialists. The big political blocs invest and so
on. Allow a little satisfaction here: Europe has done very well, at least so far, probably because
there was more tolerance for foundations 40 years ago.

It is a fact that the questioning around quantum non-locality has been extremely fruitful. The
1991 Ekert protocol for quantum key distribution [2] is a heroic example of the breakthroughs
that succeeded one after the other in the 1990s, e.g. quantum teleportation in 1993 [3] and Shor’s
celebrated algorithm in 1995 [4]. Could it be that the other problem, the quantum measurement

problem, will eventually also prove to be highly fruitful? Is the time ripe? : =

The answers to these two questions are not obvious, as the two problems are quite different. : a
Nevertheless, we would like to argue that the answers are two clear ‘yes’. Moreover, we will argue 2
that the quantum measurement problem is ready to deliver interesting results in all subfields of aes
physics, as did quantum non-locality. It will contribute, we believe, to theoretical, mathematical, 22
experimental, applied and conceptual physics. [4
