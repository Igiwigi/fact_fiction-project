Q The principal observations are given in Table I.

2 Second Series. (Bomb B.)

& In the next series of experiments (Table II.) the same mixture was exploded, at
oinitial pressures between 10 and 20 atmospheres in the large spherical bomb, B.

Sp Third Series. (Bomb A.)

% In this series of experiments (Table IIT.) the effect of gradully increasing the
“proportion of oxygen between the limits 2CH,+O, and CH,+0, was investigated.
‘SThe initial pressure was nearly the same (12°6 to 12°75 atmospheres) throughout
Sthe series. The most noteworthy fact brought to light was the total cessation of any
“gseparation of carbon after the proportion of oxygen exceeded the limit 3CH,+ 20,.
4 In interpreting the results given in Tables I. to IL. it is important to distinguish
e between (1) the primary oxidation of the hydrocarbon, which is an exceedingly rapid
> process, and is probably completed during the short interval between ignition and the
= ‘attainment of maximum pressure ; and (2) certain probable secondary interactions
g whose influence may extend far into the subsequent long cooling period. For it is
& only these latter which would be affected by variations in the rate of cooling down
8 from the maximum temperature.
S With regard to the primary oxidation, the results with the mixture 2CH,+ 0, are
obviously inconsistent with any idea of a preferential burning, whether of carbon
Sor of hydrogen. If, however, it be supposed that the oxygen initially enters
the methane molecule, forming unstable “hydroxylated” molecules, which then
