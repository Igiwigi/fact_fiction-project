(a) Which warming surrogate to use? if

Equation (4.1) uses temperature (T) as a covariate to express the rate of change of extreme (E)
with respect to time. The term dT/dt assumes greater positive values as we proceed towards
the year 2100 and can be ascertained using climate model simulations that are fairly consistent
when it comes to simulations of temperature [38-40]. This allows one to assume that a temporally
unchanging dE/dT can be used to ascertain change in E for any future time f. This logic, however,
assumes that the term dE/dT will not change into the future, a claim complicated by the fact
that future temperatures will be greater than what are currently observed. Furthermore, there is
evidence to support that the rate of change dE/dT is dependent on temperature, with negative
values noted with the higher temperatures prevalent in the tropics [13,14,41,42], attributed to a
physical upper limit of air temperature coincident with the occurrence of rainfall [20].

This leads us to the question posed in the title above, as air temperature is not a universal
climate change surrogate for all parts of the world [17,36,37]. While there have been multiple
studies advocating the use of moisture-based temperature alternatives, such as the dew point
temperature [16,37,43â€”48] which reduces the negative scaling results observed in the tropics [49],
questions remain as to whether that is again a universal surrogate useable across the world.
Questions also remain on whether a single covariate is sufficient to characterize the complex
relationship warming poses with extreme rainfall, and whether the same covariate is useable for
