The phyllotaxis of any shoot is characterized simply by the
number of foliar helices. Some defects in the theory have been pointed out by Snow (1948, 1949), and its inadequacy
to define phyllotaxis systems on apices should be apparent, for if enumeration of two sets of
intersecting parastichies fails to define the system without ambiguity it is evident that one
set alone must fail to do so. In Church’s theory the intersection points of the two sets of
curves locate the leaf centres; in Plantefol’s no indication is given as to these locations.

’ One of the striking facts of phyllotaxis is that in most spiral systems the mean divergence
along the genetic spiral approximates closely to the Fibonacci angle; in other words, the
series of leaves obtained by selecting, for instance, every thirteenth along the genetic spiral
(where thirteen is a particular number taken from the higher terms of the Fibonacci series)

will approach, though not in general precisely realize, the condition described as ortho-
stichous, i.e. the fourteenth leaf will be nearly superposed longitudinally over the first.
