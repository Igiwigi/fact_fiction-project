Around and at a short distance from the ganglion-cells there are several
oval nuclei (connective-tissue corpuscles). Figs. 4, 27, & 28 exhibit the characters of old ganglion-cells. 'The fibrous appearance
of the matrix is more distinct, the fibres which resist the action of acetic acid are more
numerous, and there are more nuclei around the ganglion-cell and around the fibres
proceeding from it, but these nuclei are not connected with either. And the important fact that the s0-called connective-tissue corpuscles outside the
ganglion-cells and outside the nerve-fibres are but faintly coloured with carmine, while
those nuclei in connexion with the ganglion-cell and nerve-fibres, although separated
from the solution by a greater distance, are more intensely coloured, must not be lost
8ight of. This was very, distinct in the specimen represented in figs. 27 & 28. Before any attempt is made to explain these facts, it is necessary to consider more
particularly the relation. of nerve-fibres and nerve-cells to the connective tisxue and con-
nective-tissne corpuscles.
