At a first glance these numbers indicate a continual falling off in the value of the
leak at constant temperature as the gas escapes from the wire. The criterion for
constant temperature was the resistance of the wire, and it was found that, owing to
the spluttering of metal which takes place at high temperatures, the resistance
of the wire at 0°C. had increased considerably during the course of the above
experiment. When this was allowed for it was found that the average temperature
of the wire at the close of the above experiment was 1280°C. instead of 1370°C.,
its value when the experiment started. The leak at 1280°C. should have been
about three divisions instead of twelve, so that pumping out the gas had
apparently increased the leak. This paradoxical result is probably caused by the fact
that the above method of reckoning over-corrects for the effect of loss by spluttering.
A calculation from the numbers in the last table but one shows that the wire had lost

about nine-tenths of the hydrogen originally present in it at the end of the
experiment, so that the experiment appears to warrant the conclusion that the
amount of the negative ionisation depends very little on the amount of hydrogen in
