Indeed, arguably such coarse-grainings are the basis of all sciences
that concern phenomena at higher scales than quantum chromodynamics. This kind of coarse-graining, made by us scientists
when we decide how to model a physical system, is not directly related to the kind of statistical physics coarse-graining
considered in this appendix. So the drop in entropy in the copy process is

S(X | n°) — S(X’ | n!) =log[P@*’ | n)] — log[P(x | n°)] (A4)
N N-k
=log (vane . ) ~ log (aren . ) . (A5)
Using Stirling’s formula to lowest order, we can approximate this drop in entropy as

Nlog[N] — (N — b)logN — k] + )> n'( login" ()] — n°@ log[n().- (A 6)

i=1

If we take N > k, then we can approximate the first two terms by expanding to lowest order in
k/N, where we obtain

Nlog[N] — (N — K)log[N — kK] =N log[N] — (N — k) (iostn1 + log [! - x})

~ klog[N] + (N — ox (A7)
=klog[N] +K(1- x): (A8)

If we also take each (i) >> v(i), the remaining terms can be similarly approximated as
