The disposition to movement in one or other direction is more nearly equipoised than
in either the first or the third states.

4. In all states of nerve the negative change is promoted by little CO,, obstructed
by much CO).

5. In all states of nerve the usual effect of prolonged tetanisation is an augmenta-
tion of the negative mobility (augmented S in the Ist and 2nd states, figs, 29, 85;
diminished N and reversal from N to § in the 8rd state, figs, 30, 32); the exceptional
effect of tetanisation is a diminution of the negative mobility (diminished S in the
2nd state, fig. 37 ; increased N in the 8rd state, fig. 36).

Expressed in terms of electrotonic changes K and A, the same series of facts may
be clothed in the following statements, involving less assumption, but also offering
less explanation :—

1. In fresh nerve (1st state) the sum of propagated katelectrotonic effects exceeds
the sum of propagated anelectrotonic effects—K > A. Therefore, negative deflection
during tetanisation.

2, With lapse of time, the difference K > A diminishes to K = A, and becomes
reversed to K < A. Therefore, positive deflection during tetanisation.

8. The effect of CO, in small quantity is to augment K. Therefore, augmented
negative deflection of the 1st and 2nd states ; diminution or reversal of the positive
