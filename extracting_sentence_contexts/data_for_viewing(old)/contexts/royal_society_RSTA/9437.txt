GASEOUS COMBUSTION AT HIGH PRESSURES. 293

air.* Prof. THoRNTON’s experiments on the ignition by the continuous current of such
hydrocarbon-air mixtures have proved that if Lis the least igniting current and p the
percentage of gas in the mixture, the ratio I/p is nearly proportional to the number
of hydrogen atoms in the molecule, a fact which suggests that the initial attack of
the oxygen is directed upon the hydrogen atoms in the hydrocarbon molecule ; and
inasmuch as any supposition of a preferential burning, in the old sense, of hydrogen
is clearly inadmissible on chemical grounds, the “hydroxylation” theory seems to
be the only satisfactory substitute.
With regard to the thermal decomposition of methyl alcohol, CH;.OH, it now is
& definitely established that at high temperatures it is resolved ultimately into carbon
3 monoxide and hydrogen, without any deposition of carbon or steam formation, in
"g accordance with the following scheme :—t+
