A caching of values to be computed is associated to the expression graph, where
already evaluated subexpressions are connected via symbol and value sharing. The traversal of the reachable subgraph of the functional environment. is
activated whenever a new value is being evaluated or an existing symbol is
redefined. The value generating process is made easier by the fact that the
language is purely functionalâ€”no state nor side effects. Proto-PiasM will support progressive computations, where each operation
works by reading a stream of incremental refinements of its operands and
produces from the very beginning a coarse approximation of the final result. The function-level programming style couples very well with the dataflow
diagrams and visual languages, where a computation is visualized as a directed
graph of data flowing between boxes representing either single operations or
whole programs.
