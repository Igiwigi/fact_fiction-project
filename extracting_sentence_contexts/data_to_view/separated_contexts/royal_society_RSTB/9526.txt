Although the reprogramming process during
iPSC generation is still wrapped in mystery, the products
offer promise in many areas, such as drug discovery, pathologi-
cal studies, toxicology, the evaluation of secondary drug effects
and regenerative medicine [15]. Here, we outline the current
knowledge and future prospects for induced pluripotency.
