Thus we have n + 1 equations involving the #
quantities a, b, c, & which may therefore be eliminated, and

the resulting equation between z, * (z), of (z) &c will
therefore be independent on them. As far then as regards
this equation they are arbitrary, so that in reascending from a
functional equation which contains # + 1 different orders of
(not including $9 (z) or z) » arbitrary constants must be
introduced. The reasoning here made use of is sufficiently
plausible, and in fact, no other than has been adduced in de-
monstration of well known and important truths. The con-
clusion too, to the extent of its literal meaning, is correct. But we have here to notice a paradox of a very singular nature,
viz: that evenin the simplest cases imaginable (such as @* (z)
= x) the general expression for þ (x) may contain, not one
or two, but an unlimited number of arbitrary constants, nay
