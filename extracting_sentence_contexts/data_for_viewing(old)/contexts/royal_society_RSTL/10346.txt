usual pracess. The result was perhaps better, but still far from satisfactory, and
would he quite inapplicable in any case where the threads were not particularly well
developed. Some sections, after 8welling, were treated with an alcoholic solution of
tannin, and when washed were shaken up with a solution of ferric chloride. The wall
then coloured the usual blue-black, and the colourless threads could be seen fairly
well, Other sections, again, were s0aked in a s0Jution of ferric chloride, and after
washing were treated with a solution of potassium ferrocyanide. In this cage the
threads were less clearly defined than with tannin and iron. Lastly, 8ections were
treated for some time with a lution of corrosive sublimate, in the hope that an

insoluble compound might be formed with the remains of the cell protoplasm. After
washing the 8ection was shaken up in sulphuretted hydrogen-water, but with no good
result. Thus all these experiments pointed to the fact that wy methods, if not
perfectly satisfactory, were at least fairly successful.

In concluding the subject of Palm endosperms I might make a few remarks upon
some particular examples which appear to be of equal interest.

In all the seeds nearly related to Calamus the structure is very typical (Plate 69,
fig. 24). I have already noticed the great development of the middle lamella in these
endosperms. Another interesting fact is, thab in Calamus and Metroxylon a well-
