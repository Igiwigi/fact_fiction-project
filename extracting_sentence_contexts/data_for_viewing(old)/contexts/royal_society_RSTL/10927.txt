represents in general a nodal bicircular quartic, and by inverting with respect to the
node, we see that it is the inverse curve of an ellipse or hyperbola, according as « and
b have the same or opposite signs, with respect to 80me point in the same plane.

Such a curve then bas two principal circles, with two single foci on each : it has
also four double tangents, two from the centre of each principal circle.

If one of the principal circles becomes a straight line, it divides the curve

symmetrically ; corresponding, in fact, to the case where a conic is inverted on a point
in one of its axes. :

If the radii of both principal circles are infinite the centre of inversion is the centre ©
of the conic : e.g., the lemniscate, whose equation would be of the form 2=aAa? +).

103. If one of the principal circles, in the last section, becomes a straight line, and
one of the two foci coincide with the centre of the principal circle, the nodes at infinity
become cusps. This case corresponds to inversion of a conic on a focus.

Suppose that 7 is infinite in F 95, then the condition that the curve should be a
