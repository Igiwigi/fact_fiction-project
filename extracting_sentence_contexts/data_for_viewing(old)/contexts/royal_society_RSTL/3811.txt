action, I ee little difference, save in the mere hypothetical expression, between
the contact and chemical theories; any conclusion which would flow from the one
would likewise be deducible from the other; there is no sequence of time in the
phenomena, the contact or completion of the circuit and the electrolytical action are
synchronous. Tf this be the view of contact theorists, the rival theories are mere
disputes about terms. If, however, the contact theory connects with the term con-
tact an idea of force which does or may produce a voltaic current independently of

chemical action, a force without consumption, I cannot but regard it as inconsistent
with the whole tenor of voltaic facts and general experience.

Another point of theory suggested by the gas battery, is the relation of latent
heat in the different cells of the battery and voltameter. According to our received
theory of caloric, oxygen and hydrogen cannot assume the gaseons from the liquid
State without rendering sensible heat latent. Now, as in the gas battery the gases
evolved from the liquid in the voltameter must require and absorb precisely as much
heat as is set free by the gases becoming liquid in each cell, it may be a curious
8ubject of future inquiry (an inquiry which that beautiful instrument, the thermo-
multiplier, will materially aid) to ascertain whether the heat absorbed in the vol-
tameter be exacted from surrounding bodies, or whether it be supplied by the action
of the battery itself, i. e. as the chemical force in the yoltameter is conversely equiva-
lent to that in each cell of the battery, and the calorific force at the voltameter is
