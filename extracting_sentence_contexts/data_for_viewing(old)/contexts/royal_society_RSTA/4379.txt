The discovery of the genetic code, however, has proved that there are two distinct molecular
mechanisms at the basis of life, the copying of the genes and the coding of proteins. The discovery
of other organic codes, furthermore, allows us to generalize this conclusion because it proves that
coding is not limited to protein synthesis. Life, in other words, is not based on copying alone. It
is based on copying and coding, and these two molecular mechanisms give origin to two distinct
mechanisms of evolution because an evolutionary mechanism is but the long-term result of a
fundamental molecular mechanism.

More precisely, the existence of copying and coding at the molecular level means that there
are two distinct types of evolutionary change: evolution by natural selection, based on copying, and
evolution by natural conventions, based on coding [7,8].

This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that there is a very close relationship between organic
codes and the great events of macroevolution. The genetic code was a precondition for the origin
of life, the signal transduction codes divided the first cells into three primary kingdoms (Archaea,
Bacteria and Eukarya), the splicing codes were instrumental to the origin of the nucleus, the
histone code provided the working rules of chromatin, and the cytoskeleton codes allowed the
Eukarya to perform internal movements, including those of mitosis and meiosis [7]. All these
great events were associated with the appearance of new organic codes, and we can understand


why. The reason is that a new code brings genuine novelties into existence because it can create
arbitrary mappings and generate relationships that have never existed before in the Universe.

The organic codes, in short, have appeared throughout the history of life and have profoundly
