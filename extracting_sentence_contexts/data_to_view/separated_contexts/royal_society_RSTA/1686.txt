The Strength of Thin Fibres. Consideration of the consequences of the foregoing general deduction indicated that
very small solids of given form, e.g., wires or fibres, might be expected to be stronger
than large ones, as there must in such cases be some additional restriction on the size
of the flaws. In the limit, in fact, a fibre consisting of a single line of molecules must
possess the theoretical molecular tensile strength. In this connection it is, of course,
well known that fine wires are stronger than thick ones, but the present view suggests
that in sufficiently fine wires the effect should be enormously greater than is observed
in ordinary cases. This conclusion has been verified experimentally for the glass used in the previous
tests, strengths of the same order as the theoretical tenacity having been observed.
