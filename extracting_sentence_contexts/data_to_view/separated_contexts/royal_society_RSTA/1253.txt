We can suppose that f(t, u,p) < mr for t € [0,1], 0<u <r and |p| < Q(r), and that
Nu 41 on dxU,;. The same conclusion holds.

6. Zero index result

We now use the fact that elements of K are concave, hence u(t) > y(#)||U/\loo where y (f) = min{t, 1 —
t}. By exploiting properties of the Green’s function it is sometimes possible to obtain a better
estimate, namely a larger function y than the one just written, for example see some of the results
in [1,2,19]. Similarly, it is also possible for more complicated differential equations (in place of u’’)


to obtain an inequality such as u(t) > y(t)||u\|oo when concavity is not available.
