— Average citations per item: 254/15 = 16.9

— The h-index: 3 (described in the following section)

Note that there is a facility for viewing the specific articles (by other authors) that have cited
your work via your university’s database links. Finally, there will be the list of all your papers
with very comprehensive citation information about each paper. Sorting the papers by selecting
‘Times cited—highest to lowest’ you will find a horizontal orange line underneath one of them
which corresponds to the h-index that I describe next.

(b) The h-index of solidity

Let us consider the fictional Jane Smith, a talented post-doc whose citation histogram is shown in
figure 13.

This shows the citations of her individual papers, which are listed in decreasing numbers
of citations. Jane may have more than 17 publications (30, say), but those beyond 17 have no
citations. We want to assign a single number as a measure of the weight or solidity of her scientific
contribution, which will give a valid comparison with that of her friend, Andrew. If we choose
as our measure her total number of papers, 30, this would be unsatisfactory if Andrew had
published fewer papers, but all were much more heavily cited. A better one would clearly be
the total number of citations.

The h-index was devised by Hirsch [54] to give a good all-round measure of weight. In
particular, he wanted to reduce the advantage of having just one very heavily cited paper, giving
