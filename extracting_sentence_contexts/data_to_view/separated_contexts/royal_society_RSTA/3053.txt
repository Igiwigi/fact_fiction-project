Maybe one reason we know so little
about the 1.5°C scenario is because, from a real-politics perspective, it seems so unlikely. In fact,
some researchers believe that ‘time has nearly run out’ for achieving the 2°C scenario [25]. (Even
in the unlikely event that all Parties under the Paris Agreement completely met their goals, we
might still be looking at 2.7°C of warming from pre-industrial levels [26].) That said, if there is
some plausible chance of hitting the 1.5°C (or 2°C) mark, it would be a mistake not to assess the
benefits and work towards them. Add to this the fact that we still have only a vague idea of what a finalized loss-and-damage
programme would be capable of. And while we might be able to know what the goals of such
a programme should be (based on the moral grounding and on practical needs), we cannot say
what the goals, once agreed upon, will be. Will the programme command sufficient funds?
