It is evident from the last-mentioned experiments, that however great may be the
influence of temperature in accelerating or retarding impregnation and develop-
ment, and however much the operation of this influence may be interfered with by
want of proper atration of the oyum, the impregnating force does not equally pertain
to all parts of the seminal fluid, but is to be found in some only of its constituents.
Experiments made before those now detailed, —and to which I had been led by a
conviction that the opinion formerly entertained, that impregnation is effected
through means of the fluid portion only of the semen, was not in accordance with
facts I had very long been acquainted with in the Articulata,—convinced me that
the spermatozoa themselves, and not the other constituents of the semen, are the
efficient agents of impregnation. LEzzwENHoEk, and, as T have since found, Prevosr
and Dumas, not only believed this to be the fact, but also held the opinion that the
spermatozoa penetrate bodily into the ovum; and this view has been more recently
insisted on by Dr. MarTix Barsy, with the additional belief that a perforation or fissure
exists in the envelopes of the oyum, through which the spermatozoon enters. On care-
ful examination of the enyelopes' of the ovum of the Frog, I have not been able to
detect any fissure or orifice, The question of the agency of the spermatozoa, never-
theless, appears to be capable of solution, however difficult it may be to ascertain the
mode and particular nature of such agency. The separation, as far as possible, of
