Taz following investigation is the result of an attempt to simplify the analytical treat-
ment of the problem of the Attraction of Ellipsoids. The application to this particular
case, of certain known propositions relating to closed surfaces in general, showed that
the principal theorems could easily be deduced without taking account of any other
properties of the ellipsoid than those expressed by two differential equations, of which
the truth is evident on inspection. In fact if we take the equation

a? y? 22 FTE

we see at once that the expression on the left side, considered as a function of &, y, 2, h.
satisfies the two partial differential equations

and these equations express all that we require to know about the ellipsoid, except the
fact that the surface is capable of being extended to infinity in every direction by the

variation of h, without ceasing to be closed. But it appeared also that the snccess of
the method depended only on the circumstance that the right-hand member of the first

equation, and the coefficient of F in the second, are constants independent of &. It was
therefore possible to generalize the process by taking indeterminate functions of 4; for
these two constants.
