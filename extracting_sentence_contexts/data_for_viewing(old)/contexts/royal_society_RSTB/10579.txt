semantic memory, of a novel episodic representation—is itself an instance of
a statistical, in fact associative, process. The article concludes that the same pro-

cognition semantic memories also enable the generation, from those semantic memories,
of representations that correspond to individual tokens, and of novel episodic
facts about those tokens. Statistical learning is a window onto these deeper
processes that underpin cognition.
