Returning to (5.15), we thus have the following theorem:

The fact that our final formula for the moments (in the d=3 case) can be expressed so
cleanly and succinctly suggests that an alternate point of view should exist that produces the
same formula more directly. Indeed, A Diaconu & V Pasol (2014, personal communication) have
derived an equivalent formula using multiple Dirichlet series over finite fields, though perhaps a
simpler approach can be found.

We list the first 10 moments in table 22.

It appears, from our numerical data, that (5.22) also holds for Fj, if k < 9, i.e. if we replace p with
any odd prime power q, whether divisible by 3 or not. For k > 10, one would need to adjust the
terms tr2),2(T)). For example, for k= 10, and q= Pp, it appears from our tables that one should
replace t(p) by 2t(p*) - t(p). We do not attempt to address the general formula here since the
above suffices for the purpose of testing the Andrade-Keating conjecture, which does not see the
