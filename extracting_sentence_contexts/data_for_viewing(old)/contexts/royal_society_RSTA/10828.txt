A more satisfactory hypothesis is that this is a weathered rock rubbish, which has
accumulated on the flatter grounds where the rain has little power of washing away
fine fragments, especially as the roots of the vegetation serve to hold the soil
together and prevent its removal. When saturated with rain such incoherent
materials will tend to slip under the action of gravity, and the slow creeping of the soil
down the principal slopes may sometimes give it a roughly-bedded appearance. The
bombs and crystalline blocks are the larger masses enclosed in the old tuffs from
which the brown earth has mostly formed. In many respects it bears a strong
resemblance to the “ head” which covers the rocks in Cornwall, only the appearance
_ of bedding is more frequent.
