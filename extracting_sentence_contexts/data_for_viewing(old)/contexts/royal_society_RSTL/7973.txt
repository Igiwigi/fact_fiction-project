DS=2 is the spot's heliographical latitude. Lo

Now, in the triangle PSC the angle PCS is obviously the algebraical
sum of the angle S CN', or the angle of position of the spot S ( =P) -
reckoned from north towards east, and the angle N' CP=G+H. PR OR”

Let angle SCP=S CN'+N' CP=P+G+H=y, further we have
SC=2= angular distance from centre, and P C=90%—D.

Figure 10, which has been suggested to us by Sir Joun Henscnr, places these facts
in a more general and probably als clearer manner before the reader. In this figure.
the sun's equator is taken for a plane of projection, and the spherical triangles are re-
ferred to the centre of the 8un. The letters are identical with those in fig. 9, while C
in fig. 10, looked at from without by a spectator Placed in the line of the earth's situa-
tion, corresponds to C in fig. 9, the centre of the visible disk.

The triangle PSC will give us, by well-known Fig. 10.
