Now in a much-pitted tissne, e.g., that of a pul-
vinus, the cell wall after treatment with sulphuric acid nsnally becomes much 8wollen,
causing an elongation and at the same time a narrowing of the pits, and may, more-
over, in its 8wollen condition clogely invest and surround the protoplasm. When 8nch
a section is treated with methyl violet, the deeply stained tubular pits, being placed
symmetrically opposite one another on either side of the common cell wall, abut on
the shrunken and similarly stained protoplasm, and give the impression that a distinet
and well-defined continuity exists from cell to cell. Thus in Anmucia the most beautiful
and striking appearance is produced which is further heightened by the fact that pro-
cesses from the main protoplasmic mass usually go for some distance into the pits.
(See Plate 68, fig. 10.) If, however, the section be treated for some time with dilute
glycerine, the colour is dissolved from the cell wall and the pits and the protoplasm
alone remains stained, thus making the real state of things apparent. The reaction with methylene blue is perhaps the most characteristic. When a
8ection is 8tained with this reagent before treatment with sulphuric acid, the cell
wall and the pit membrane will be deeply coloured, the protoplasm being left unstained.
