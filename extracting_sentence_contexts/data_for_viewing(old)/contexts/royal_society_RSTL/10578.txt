With these few general remarks, indicating some of the characteristic differences of
result, on the two plots, we now turn to a detailed consideration of their comparative
botany.

The following Table (LXXV., pp. 1364-5) gives, in the usual form, a record of the
facts relating to the plot under consideration ; it also shows the amounts yielded by
the different orders and species compared with those on the unmanured plot 3, and on
plot 9 with the mineral manure and the nitrogen supplied as ammonia-salts.

In the firs place there were, on the average, two fewer Graminee, two fewer
Leguminosm, and 16 fewer Miscellanezs, than without manure, the average number
found in the four separations in the samples from plot 14 being 29. Compared with
plob 9 there was but little difference in number ; in fact, only one more species.

There is not, very much difference in the average percentages of total Graminew,

 Leguminose, and Miscellanez, on plot 9 and on plot 14. On each, there is considerable
fluctuation as between the Graminez and the Miscellanee in the different separation-
years; and the relations are not the same in the same season under the different
conditions of the two plots. On the average, the nitrate plot gives a higher per-
centage of Graminez, and a lower percentage of Miscellanez ; but, on the other hand,
though till in insignificant proportion, it yields notably more Leguminose, especially
