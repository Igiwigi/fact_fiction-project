liquid be made to rotate upon its vertical axis, the liquid will be observed to rise from
the centre towards the sides to a height depending on the angular velocity and the
diameter of the vessel. As s00n as the velocity has reached a certain limit, the liquid
will commence to overflow the upper edge of the vessel, being thrown from it in the
form of a fluid sheet in a tangential direction. If the velocity remain constant from!
this moment, the overflow of the liquid will be observed to cease, although the liquid
remaining in the vessel will continue to touch the extreme edge or brim. Supposing
that the velocity of the vessel be now diminished, the liquid will be observed to sink,
but will rise again immediately to its former position*when the rotation returns to its
previous limit of angular velocity. This velocity is the result of the balance of two
forces acting on the liquid particles, namely, gravity and centrifugal force.

It is a well-known fact that the curvilinear 8urface produced by a liquid in rotation is

that of a paraboloid, the parameter of which is expressed by ED and the curve itself
