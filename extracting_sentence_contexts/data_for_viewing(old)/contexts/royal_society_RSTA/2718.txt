an additional MM branch bifurcates from the left fold on the Turing branch, undergoes a loop
(locations D-F) and extends to large a. Both MM branches coexist with an isola (red dotted line).
The corresponding d =7 bifurcation diagram is shown in figure 8b. The remainder of this paper
is devoted to deconstructing the complex sequence of transitions that allow the relatively simple
diagram at d = 8 to metamorphose into the remarkable structure shown in figure 8b at d =7.

We begin with the Maxwell-like behaviour near location D in figure 8b. Figure 9 shows that
this behaviour is associated with the presence of a near-heteroclinic connection to the BS state.
The large loops to the left of this structure are associated with the addition of pairs of peaks to
the right of the BS hole and the destruction of two peaks on its left. As a result as one proceeds
from A to G the BS hole gradually migrates to the left. Similar behaviour takes place on the right,
this time involving a UV plateau: as one proceeds from H to B this plateau migrates to the right.
In fact, a careful look shows the presence of two nearby Maxwell points, one associated with the
BS holes and the other with the UV plateaus. The branch repeatedly passes through this region
resulting in an oscillation between a hole and a plateau that injects new structure on one side and
eliminates similar structure on the other side resulting in the translation of the hole or plateau.
