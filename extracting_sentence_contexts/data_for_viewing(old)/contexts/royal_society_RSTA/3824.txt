meta-energy (our generalization of ectropy) has been changed by a factor 3 in order to improve
presentation. The proofs have been expanded or corrected and new results have been added, such
as theorem 4.2 or the discussion in ยง3b. These results constitute new examples of the application
of meta-energy as a useful Lyapunov function for macroscopic linear systems. The concept of a
finite heat bath is also motivated as a macroscopic system obeying a dissipative dynamics driven
by its meta-energy. Physical interpretations of the quantities appearing in the equations have been
provided whenever possible.

Finally, supplementary explanations have been inserted to connect the dots between the
microscopic lossless and macroscopic dissipative systems. These explanations, for instance
describing baths as harmonic oscillators of infinite or very large size, claim no originality
or exhaustivity but sketch for self-completeness a linear-system-theoretic derivation of some
thermodynamic facts.

2. Dissipative linear systems with random state

The theory of dissipative systems, since its introduction by Willems [3,4], has become a central tool
in modelling systems storing or dissipating energy, or other arbitrary quantities acquired from
their environment. Although it is a general theory applicable to nonlinear (dynamical) systems,


we consider only linear systems here. We illustrate that the theory, even in this relatively restricted
use, can be used to develop rigorous insights and also some new concepts in thermodynamics.
