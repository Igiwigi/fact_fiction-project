We can hardly interpret this layer otherwise than as an endodermis, though I could
not satisfy myself as to the presence of the characteristic marks on the radial walls. Beyond the endodermis comes the primary cortex, which resembles that of the root
of Lyginodendron Oldhamium in its lax, lacunar structure, the presence of ‘ secretory
sacs,” and the definite double layer of cells at the periphery. The rootlet might, in fact, be taken for a young triarch rootlet of Lyginodendron,
if it were not for the very distinct formation of periderm, which I have never found so
well marked, even in the oldest roots of the latter plant.* The specimen, on the
other hand, agrees so closely with the Medullosa roots now described, that there can be
no doubt of its identity. -It thus proves, in conjunction with other specimens, the
pericyclic origin of the periderm in these organs. It is unnecessary to take up more time with a description of the rootlets, which
ocew in great numbers, associated with the larger roots and with the stems of
Medullosa anglica. In many cases their identity is certain, while others are more
dubious.
