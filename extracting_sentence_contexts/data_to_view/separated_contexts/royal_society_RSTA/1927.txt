ยง 5. General Description of Optical Creep in Celluloid. On trying the very first experiment with celluloid, two facts immediately became
apparent. (1) After applying the load the retardation at once attained a certain initial value,
which, however, was very difficult to determine directly with precision, as it was impos-
sible to apply the load suddenly enough without starting vibrations and, in addition, to
observe the band at the same instant. The retardation, however, increased with the time, the load now remaining constant
throughout.
