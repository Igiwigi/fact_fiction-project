As regards Prerrerâ€™s experiment it was assumed that the conducting power was
arrested under chloroform. It has, however, been pointed out by Vunes* that,
though a narcotised pulvinus certainly loses its motile excitability, it does not
necessarily follow that its conductivity likewise is completely abolished. Instances
are known, in fact, to physiologists in which a tissue whose excitability has been
abolished will still persist in maintaining its conducting power. This fact may be
demonstrated in the case of plants by taking a specimen of Biophytum and applying
a strong stimulus to an old leaf, the motility of whose leaflets has been abolished on
account of age. Though its own leaflets do not afford any motile indication, the
excitation is found to be conducted through the petiole of the old leaf so as to induce
the fall of the leaflets in a neighbouring young leaf.
