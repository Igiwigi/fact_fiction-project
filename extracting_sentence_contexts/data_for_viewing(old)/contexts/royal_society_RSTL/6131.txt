constituted the bed of an ancient n6v6; and the groovings and polishings, at the very
summit of the pass, show that the ancient n6v6s, as well as the ancient glaciers, iq
upon their beds. In company with my friend Professor Ransay, and assisted by his
great experience, I visited the sites of other ancient n6y6s, and found the same true of
all of them; they all slid more or less over their beds.

No investigator of glacier motion can shut his eyes to those facts, nor refuse to give
them their proper weight. The sliding theory is beyond doubt to 8ome extent true; and
many of the objections raised against it, and still repeated in works intended to instruct
the public, are altogether futile.

Here, as in other cases, we find that the extreme facts have been dwelt upon princi-
pally by rival theorists, and coexistent truths have, by partial treatment, been rendered
apparently hostile to each other. It is perfectly certain that a glacier changes its form
by pressure like a plastic mass, but it is equally true that it sides over its bed.
