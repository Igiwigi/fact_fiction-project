He studied the skeleton
and the outward form, but the latter can have been of little value as he used
preserved material. He noted in his pure cultures of Strongylocentrotus the frequent
occurrence of multiple rods in the postoral arm skeletons. In 1903 Logs (52) attempted to obviate the difficulty arising from the fact that
with the Echinoids used up to that period for experiments in heredity, there must
always be some doubt concerning the inheritance of characters so much resembling
one another. He devised a method which enabled him to hybridize forms so far
removed from one another as Asferias and Strongylocentrotus. While the early
larvee of the former have no skeleton, those of the latter have one.
