EFFECTS WHICH FOLLOW LIGATION OF THE CEREBRAL ARTERIES. 101

In close connection with these experiments stand certain results obtained by Morr
and SHERRINGTON.* These authors determined that, after a unilateral section of all
the posterior roots of the brachial plexus has been made in the monkey, the limb is
paralysed in so far as no “
Nevertheless the limb reacted to cortical excitation, and in fact the arm area was, if
anything, hyper-excitable. The limb is, we may suppose, paralysed because the
spatial sensations which come from the limb no longer stream into the association
field formed by the cortex cerebri. The animal forgets that it has the limb.
Bupnorr and Hemennatnt showed that by gently stroking a limb the cortical
excitability might be increased in the area which controls the same. On the other
hand, Mariqgue and Exner{ proved that circumvyallation of a cortical area, by
severing the association fibres, produces paralysis just as much as extirpation. The
“motor centres” are therefore not autonomous, and are only reflexly aroused into
activity. It has been suggested that the paralysis following division of the posterior
roots is due to lowering of the excitability of the spinal centres (Bastran), for these
are cut off from the normal reflex excitations. In my experiments there is no question
of spinal centres. The cerebral anzemia evidently produces a block on the sensory
