and the isolation of the radials. In this last feature Archeocrinus and Reteocrinus
resemble the Rhodoerinites, and if the limits of that section conld not be enlarged to
receive them, they might very well be left in a group by themselves, distinguished by
their ornamentation.

But they are out of place by the side of Glyptocrinus, with all its radials united
laterally. It thus represents a comparatively late ontogenetic condition, not even the
radials of the posterior side being separated by an anal plate as in the lyptasterites.
There are,doubtless, close affinities and remarkable transition forms between Glyptocrinus
and Reteocrinus, as as8erted by Messrs. WACHSMUTH and SPRINGER. But these
depend very largely upon the characters of the rays and arms, which are of a
comparatively subordinate value ; while the lateral separation of the radials in the
las named genus, and in the /hodocrinites, is a fact of considerable importance in
Crinoid Morphology.

It must be remembered also that Glyptocrinus has decided affinities with some of
the earlier Actinocrinide, certain species appearing to be without under-basals. In
fact, according to the American authors, © It is a question whether that genus, ab
least partly, should no be arranged with the other group alt ogether.”

Thus, then, I would divide the Rhodocrinide (W. and S.) into groups as follows :—
