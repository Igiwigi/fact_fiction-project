Not at first fully recognising the probability of error in the first results, it was some
time before I recognised the possibility of a variation of the specific heat with
pressure. The ordinary contention that from ReeNavutr’s experiments on air at con-
stant pressure the conclusion is legitimate that at constant volume there is no variation
of specific heat, was so (apparently) forcible, that any other result was deemed
improbable. In truth, however, the assumption of perfectness for air is at variance
with the facts, and it is probable that the variation of specific heat is an outcome
of its imperfectness. Later on, the experiments on carbon dioxide, a typically
