In these series, C. marginalis exhibits a comparatively high mortality; while that for
C. chloropyga is not much more than the normal experimental mortality. There is evidence
that the deaths due to experimental conditions or to a natural proportion of fatalities, as
the case may be, are higher in C. marginalis than in the other species of blowflies. This is also
indicated by the fact that, in the present series, C. marginalis puparia were of good average
size. Allowing for this, however, it is evident that C. chloropyga has been much more
successful than C. marginalis, and this may be ascribed to its more rapid assimilation of food
at an earlier stage in the history of the mixed population. Comparing the series containing 100 larvae of each species with the nearest comparable
series giving straightforward competition for food and having a similar initial density in
Lucilia equivalents, it will be seen that while the C. chloropyga-C. marginalis population has
a combined total mortality of 40-9°%, the Lucilia-C. chloropyga association suffers approxi-
mately a 25°, mortality.
