“From the results of other investigations described and the figures given in the
preceding tables the conclusion seems inevitable that all our principal soil types—
in fact practically all cultivable soils—contain naturally a nutrient solution which
varies within comparatively narrow limits with regard either to composition or
concentration, and which is usually sufficient for plant growth. Apparently, there-
fore, all these soils are amply supplied with the necessary plant foods, and these
plant foods are not in themselves a matter of such paramount importance to the
agriculturist.”*

“This water is moving over the soil particles in films and with slowness. It is
long in contact with successive fragments of any particular mineral and all the
different minerals making up the soil. Consequently it tends towards a saturated
solution with respect to the mineral mass, and it follows that if every soil contains
all the common rock-forming minerals, every soil should give the same saturated
solution, barring the presence of disturbing factors.” + :
