TueoreM 2. If A, 4’, B and 8’ are functions with S! symmetry satisfying the conditions
of theorem 1, then

(ABS! 0 | var | A’B’S'w) = (A | var | A’) (B| B’) +(B| var |B’) (A| 4’), (9)

and = (ABS!w| H| A’B’S'w) = CA, 4’) C(B, B’) (ABS'0 | inv | A’B’S' 0)
+(A | var | A’) (B| B’)+(B| var |B’) (A| A’). (10)
Proof. By the usual removal of the w operator and the fact that all contributions to the
integral arising from different S! groupings are contained in the invariant, the result follows. Comment. Two particular results follow from this theorem, the first of which will be used
repeatedly below.
