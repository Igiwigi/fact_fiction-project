brata, it may probably be with the carapace of the Crustacea, inasmuch as this is
developed from a corresponding region and has similar functions, i. e. to protect the
respiratory organs.

Hitherto what has been said has referred to the morphology of the external organs.
It remains to show on what plan the internal organs are arranged, and how the
archetypal arrangement is modified among the different families. To enter upon
this subject fully would belong rather to a formal treatise upon the Mollusea. For
the present my object is merely to point out the fundamental unity which obtains

* For clearness' zake I have referred to the © hzmal” and © neural” flexures as if they always took place in
a yertical plane, whereas, as every one knows, the anal aperture is almost always either to the right or the left
in the Gasteropoda. The only modification of the theory required to meet this fact, is to suppose that the
hwmal outgrowth takes place more rapidly on one side than on the other.

among certain of the most important systems of organs, and to bring into prominence
some facts in the anatomy of the Mollusca which have hitherto been unknown or
neglected.

With these views I propose to treat—-1, of the nervous system ; 2, of the vascular
system ; 3, of certain portions of the alimentary system ; and 4, of the renal system.
