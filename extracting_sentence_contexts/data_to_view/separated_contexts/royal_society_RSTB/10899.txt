instance of the ergodicity principle, which states that averages

identical expectations at stationarity. The specific form taken
here by this principle is a consequence of the strong-selection
assumption. However, ergodicity arguments could be used
under more general conditions, in combination with diffusion
approximations, so as to derive mean-field approximations
that would also be valid in nearly neutral regimes.
