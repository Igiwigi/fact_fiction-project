functions satisfying the boundary conditions

36 = Hat +n(s2—¥")} (2)
= m{yt—a(s—¥9)}, (2:10)
Bs = ly—mx, (2-11)

in which n denotes the outward drawn normal to the boundary of direction cosines
(1, m, 0). In the case of ¢, its conjugate function 7, satisfies the boundary condition

V5 = $(x?+y?) +const., (2-12)

and we find it convenient usually to find y, and deduce ¢, if needed. The constants
7 and 7’ in (2-4), (2°5), (2°7), (28) are determined from the fact that, since the stresses
across a section z =c, (0<e</), acting upon the material for which z<c, must be
equivalent to the load (W, W’) localized at (/’, g’), in particular their moments about
the z-axis must be the same, whence

[(ov.—92,) a8 = — We, (213)

[o#.—y,) as = Wy’, (2:14)

the integrals being taken over the cross-section .

The flexure functions ¢, 6’ are not quite of the classical form of Saint-Venant’s
flexure functions x, x’, as given in Love (1927, pp. 332, 343), but are closely related,
