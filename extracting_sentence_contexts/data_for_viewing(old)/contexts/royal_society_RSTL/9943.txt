besides superphosphate, the residue of potass previously applied, an annual supply of
sulphates of soda and magnesia also, and with these considerably increased luxuriance
of growth. Under such conditions the roots of the herbage would doubtless have
pos8ession of an increased range of soil and s8ubsoil, and as it is abvious that notwith-
standing the considerable residue of previously supplied potass the growing plants
nevertheless suffered from a deficient available supply of it relatively to other con-
stibuents, it would appear probable that they would extract from the soil, at any rate
as much as the unmanured herbage. Our knowledge, or rather our ignorance, of the
condition in which the available portion of the potass of the oil itself exists within it,
and is taken up by the roots, or of the condition in which the unexhausted residue of
the previously supplied potass is retained, and becomes available in 80 piece-meal a
manner, is such that it is impossible to come to any definite conclusion on the point.
It will be seen that the facts guggest an interesting and useful line of experimental
enquiry.

That certain soils do, as a matter of fact, retain a residue of supplied potass, and in a
slowly available condition, for very many years, is conclusively proved by evidence of
very different kinds. Thus, in the experiments at Rothamsted in which wheat has
now been grown for 36 years in snccession on the same land, the effects of the residue
of potass 8upplied more than 28 years ago are till traceable in an increased produce
compared with that where there had not been such supply, and also in an increased
