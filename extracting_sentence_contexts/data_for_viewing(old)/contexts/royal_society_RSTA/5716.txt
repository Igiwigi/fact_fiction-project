context of variational Monte Carlo methods [67], thus providing yet another pathway to study
lattice gauge models in higher dimension [68,69]. Hereafter, we concentrate on loop-free TN, i.e.
TN displaying no cycles in their network architecture, namely MPS and tree tensor networks
(TTNs).

(a) Matrix product states

The methods that we describe in what follows, share as a building block a set of local finite
matrices that encode the information of the system. We show how to build these matrices, their
properties and how they can be used to compute efficiently any correlator. We define the matrix
product state showing two possible ways to build it. The first one is in the spirit of DMRG
method of White [3], based on the Schmidt decomposition of a quantum state. The second one,
the original point of view, comes from the fact that the matrices can be seen as a bond between the
neighbour sites in a chain. The latter approach springs from the valence bond model introduced
by Affleck et al. [70] and generalized by Fannes et al. [71]. The link between the two points of view
has been unveiled by Ostlund & Rommer [6]. The results on the scaling of the entanglement
faithfully represented by the ansatz lays at the heart of the success of this formalism in one
dimensional system. Starting from these seminal works, it has been shown how to generalize
them to nonlocal interactions, different boundary conditions and how to perform dynamical
simulations of quantum systems with classical resources.

We first review some useful mathematical properties of composed quantum systems and show
their implications for the MPS ansatz. The Schmidt decomposition of a quantum state between
the first site and rest of the chain reads,
