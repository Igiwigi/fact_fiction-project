per Sn—C link ruptured. Unfortunately, the amount
of energy required to raise the tin atom from the 5s?5p? to the lowest 555% configuration is
not known with certainty. That it is fairly large is seen from the fact that for Sn* the change
55°5p, Py > 5s5p", *P, involves no less than 44,509 cm.~! (McCormick & Sawyer 1938). Whereas the figure we require is expected to be smaller, it will approach this order of
magnitude.
