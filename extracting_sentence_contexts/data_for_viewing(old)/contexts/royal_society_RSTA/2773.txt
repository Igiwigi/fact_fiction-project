regularly by the controllers of computer systems. Indeed, if only to protect their investment
in developing the system or their costs in operating and maintaining it, the controllers of a
system are likely to demand particular performance targets according to their preferred metrics
for success. The questions of how a system is measured, what about it is measured, and how
well the system must perform against those metrics are all key issues to be established during
the design and deployment of a computer system. Claims that a system is inscrutable should
address how a system is measured and describe why the desired introspection into its operation
is relevant to observable performance. Once again, we see that inscrutability is likely to be the
result of pre-existing power dynamics, not a property of the technology or its application.

Extensional review of computer systems may also be undertaken by privileged oversight
entities. It is common that the inputs and outputs of specific decisions are reviewed for
accuracy or so errors can be corrected. In fact, the right to review computer system outputs
in this way is guaranteed in laws such as in the adverse action notices of the Fair Credit
Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) in the USA, and
in the Article 13-15 rights to data access and correction in the GDPR in Europe. Beyond
individual decisions, examination of group-level system outcomes is a cornerstone of quantitative
evaluation for policy interventions of all kinds. While there are limits, courts have even
held that group-level extensional evaluation is an important approach to counteracting
discrimination [44].


It is tempting to believe that the presence of information for review will naturally lead to Lo |
accountability for any observable issues. But this is not the case: holding parties responsible
