minutest corpuscles, which are mere points, nothing besides molecular motion can
be discerned. It may be a question, whether molecular motion differs in its nature
from the motion of the larger corpuscles just referred to. The division of the blood-
corpuscles into corpuscles of minuter size, though apparent in blood from either side
of the heart, has seemed more general in that from the left side; which is perhaps
deserving of notice in connection with the subject of respiration.

199. (October, 1841.) As explanatory of the foregoing paragraph, I may perhaps
be permitted to mention some appearances that have since fallen under my notice.
It is necessary, however, to apprise the reader that the remarkable appearances about
to be detailed are not all of them to be always found ; and indeed that sometimes most
if not all of them are absent. To what circumstances their presence or their absence
5 is to be attributed, it would be premature at this time to speculate, without facts that
are $till wanted regarding the action of the atmospheric air upon the blood-corpuscles
in their passage through the lungs ; and some unknown change which, from obser-
vations not yet completed, I am inclined to think these corpuscles undergo in that
portion cf the circulating fluid which passes throngh the liver. Neither am I in pos-
ses8ion of facts connected with the process of digestion, which may possibly influence
the reproduction of the blood-corpuscle ; supposing this reproduction to be effected
in the way suggested by the observations of the foregoing paper, and my previous
memoirs. And here I am reminded to mention, that some of the animals from which
the blood in question (after death) was taken, had not received food for many hours
previously, Such were the sheep at the London slanghter-houses. In these instances,
therefore, the minute objects about to be described cannot be referred to the forma-
tion of chyle, and its addition to the mass of blood.
