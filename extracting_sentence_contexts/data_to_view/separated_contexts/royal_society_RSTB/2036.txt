Mitier, who used the
rate of flow of air through a leaf as an index of the degree to which the stomata are
open. This method requires elaborate apparatus and must, I imagine, be slow in
action and difficult to manage, but I have no personal experience of it. Another group of methods depends on the fact that in adult leaves transpiration is
stomatal rather than cuticular, so that, other things being equal, the yield of watery
vapour will depend on the degree to which the stomata are open, and may be used
as an index of their condition. A familiar demonstration is to place a leaf between
two plates of glass, when the glass in contact with the stomatal surface becomes
dewed with moisture, while the other plate remains dry. In 1878 Mercert invented
a refinement of this method; he used paper impregnated with certain salts of
palladium and mercury, which assume a dark brown or black colour when moistened.
