Although it has been necessary to restrict the number of illus-
trations in this paper, they are sufficient to show that the eye is a valuable
additional factor in classification, and that where its characters do not agree with the
most recent systems, the discrepancies deserve serious consideration. Some of the results obtained are, moreover, of phylogenetic value, and the well-
defined traces of vestigial relics which I have found in many instances, are interesting
from an evolutionary point of view. * ©A Classification of Vertebrata,’ London, 1898.

Lastly, the fact that certain conditions which occur in Man as congenital defects
are normal in some animals, may assist the ophthalmologist in diagnosis, and we
shall certainly find abundant field for physiological speculations which may advance
our knowledge of vision, and bring us nearer to the solution of the problem of
colour perception. The first part of this paper contains a systematic record of the observations made. In the second part some of the implied problems and resulting generalisations are
dealt with.
