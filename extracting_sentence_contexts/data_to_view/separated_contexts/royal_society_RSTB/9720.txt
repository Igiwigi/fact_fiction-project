In contrast, our F.xtra—Hamilton(P) reflects the effects from the
past actions of types A and N on their current differences in
absolute fitnesses. In other words, we are considering different
objects, and partitioning them in ways that are conceptually
different. Second, in [21,22], the assumption of additive gene Bo = Vo + Q[Ov9 + (1 — Ov] > 0 (5.4)

We now assume, as we did in §2, that vp < 0.
