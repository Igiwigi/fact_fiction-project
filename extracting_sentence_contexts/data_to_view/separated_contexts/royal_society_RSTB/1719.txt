5 A really accurate knowledge of vegetative characters, especially of those derived
Â© from the internal structure, may, we believe, be trusted to put us on to the right
B track i in cases where the larger systematic groups are alone in question. EB The fact that in various respects both Lyginodendron and Heterangium strongly
E resemble Ferns has been noticed since the first discovery of these plants, and has been
Q demonstrated in the preceding pages. As regards the former genus, we have now
proved beyond doubt that the highly compound leaves were those of a Sphenopteris,
and in Heterangium the general character of the foliage was evidently similar. The
external form and even the venation of the leaf, however, would by themselves carry
_ ho decisive weight, though hundreds of fossil species have been referred to the Ferns
on no better grounds.
