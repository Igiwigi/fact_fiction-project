a VIILâ€”THE EYE.

(Plate 19, fig. 311.)

Ihave only a single fact to mention with regard to the eye, but that is one of
considerable interest. As Owxn showed, the pecten is absent in the adult, Apteryx
being in this respect unique among birds. But in advanced embryos of stages
H and I there is a distinct pecten in the form of a conical pigmented prominence,
about 1-2 mm. long, passing from the entrance of the optic nerve towards the back of
the lens. Figs. 311 is taken from a dissection of Stage I: fig. 158 (Plate 13) shows
its relations in a section of Stage H.
