A larger school volume
energetic advantages of swimming in a school may be more increases the amount of water and therefore the DO available
widespread among individuals than previously thought, and per member of the school. The individuals at the rear of the
therefore the benefits of schooling may be more strongly school are those with highest benefits derived from an increase
linked to reducing the costs of locomotion than previously in school volume. In fact, the increased cross-sectional area
believed [78]. (i.e. width and depth) of the school, coupled with the increased

length, can provide a sufficient mixing of water mass which
then allows a higher amount of DO in the water. Experiments
on schooling herring demonstrated an increase in the water

Progressive exposure to hypoxic water (from normoxia to volume per individual from 1.5 length’ in normoxia to greater
hypoxia in 30 [86], 90 [87] and 220 min [34,62]) can induce than 5 length® at 20% oxygen saturation [62]. This change in
changes in the structure and dynamics of fish schools.
