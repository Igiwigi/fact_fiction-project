happens is as if a very slight elevation of temperature at the critical stage induces
that amount of breakdown in the envelope which is necessary before the eutectoid
can appear in bulk.

18. Evidence of the Existence of other Effects. — “

It is apparent that effects of pressure of the kind just contemplated would decrease
along with the amount of free iron present beforehand, and would therefore become
less important as the percentage of carbon in the steel rose towards that contained
by the eutectoid. They might therefore explain the observed gradual rise in the
temperature of reappearance of the eutectoid as the percentage of carbon in the steel
rises towards 0°9 ; but they would not account for the whole of the lag. In particular,
they would not explain the fact that in the hyper-eutectoid steels the temperature
of reappearance seems to be practically constant and higher than in any of the
others.

It is, in fact, obvious that surface effects, considered in conjunction with the
conditions of equilibrium, must play an important part in determining the temperature
at which the eutectoid appears.

We proceed to consider important cases from this point of view.
