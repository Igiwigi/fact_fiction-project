to separate the spermatozoa by filtration from the more fluid portion of semen, and
testing the effect of these two constituents in artificial impregnation. To them
therefore be all honour for the result ; although even they, as they honourably men-
tion, bad themselyes been anticipated in this by SeaLLanzax1, and that too with
similar 8uccess. The extraordinary results obtained by SeaLLaNzantf in artificial im-
pregnation, and the imperfect knowledge which we possess of the nature of the means
by which it is effected, has induced me to endeavour to repeat and vary his experiment,
and to conceive others, which, so far as I am aware, have not yet been attempted. I
bave been the more urged to this from the circumstance mentioned by SPALLANZANI,
and already alluded to (p. 189), the occasional supposed absence of spermatozoa from
fluid that is capable of fecundating; and also from a belief formed long ago. with
regard to the Articulata, that the spermatozoa, nevertheless, certainly are the efficient
agents in impregnation, although full proof of the fact has been wanted. TI have
been desirous therefore of learning how far this belief can bear the test of direct
experiment, or the fact be capable of demonstration by artificial means in the Am-
phibia. As, however, the experiments I have myself made vary from those of the
authors mentioned, —have not been influenced by the result they bad previously
arrived at—have been somewhat more extended, and, as I believe, will now tend to
place the fact of the direct agency of the spermatozoa in impregnating the ovum
beyond doubt,—it has seemed desirable still to give them in detail, as assisting to
establish an important point of knowledge by facilitating a comparison of the results
of independent investigations.

Duration of susceptibility.—The length of time during which the oyum, after it has
been passed, remains susceptible of fecundation, is affected by several circumstances.
