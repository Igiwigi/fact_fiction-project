The Relation between the Effects of Sodium Citrate and Fertilisation wpon the Eggs.

It has been shown that the effect of sodium citrate on unfertilised eggs resembles
that of fertilisation in that it increases the electrical conductivity of the eggs ; also,
a few preliminary experiments support the expectation that sodium citrate may,
under certain conditions, function as a parthenogenetic agent. But whereas, the
effect of the spermatozoon on the electrical resistance of the egg is quite irreversible,
that of sodium citrate is partially or entirely removed if the eggs are transferred to
normal sea-water.

That the two phenomena are related would appear from the fact that exposure to
citrate solution, as it were, anticipates a part of the fall in electrical resistance
caused by the spermatozoon.
