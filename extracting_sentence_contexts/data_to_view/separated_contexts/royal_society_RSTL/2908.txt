Conclusion. The very great length unto which this paper has already been extended, neces-
sarily prevents me from entering 80 fully into all the circumstances connected with
the evolution of heat in insects as the great importance attached to this interesting
subject demands; I shall, therefore, review the contents of this paper, and other cir-
cumstances connected with the production of animal heat, with as much conciseness
as possible. On comparing the whole of the facts we haye just examined, we cannot fail to ob-
serve the yery close relation which subsists between the amount of heat developed,
and the quantity of respiration. We haye seen in the larya, the pupa, and the
perfect insect, that when the respiration is accelerated the temperature is also in-
creased, and that when respiration is diminished the temperature 8ubsides. When
the insect is sleeping, its respiration gradually becomes slower, and its temperature
continues to lessen until the insect is aroused, when immediately after the first respi-
rations it is again increased.
