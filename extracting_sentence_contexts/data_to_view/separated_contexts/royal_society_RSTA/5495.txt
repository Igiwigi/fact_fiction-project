Among them, 121, 122 and 132 dictate, respectively, the shear viscosity, bulk viscosity in
a gas with internal degrees of freedom, and thermal diffusivity. The other four do not explicitly
manifest in the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations.

(d) Binomial transform

Direct determination of a” and a from f(v;) by equations (2.7) requires an interpolation scheme
of some kind as v; depends on u and 6 and varies with space and time [22,23]. To avoid the
associated numerical dissipation, the binomial transform, equation (A 25), between the Hermite

expansion coefficients in the absolute and relative frame can be used to obtain a” from a” as
oF dA?) = 9, (2.192)
oF dO =a® — 3ua? (2.198)

and +924) — a® — aua® + 6 [un + (1 — 6)8] a), (2.19¢)


and from a”) to a) as

a?) =0°F d®, (2.202)
a®) =0°F d9) + 3ua® (2.20b)
and a’) =o 3 a) + 4ua? — 6 [uu + (1 — 6)6] a). (2.20c)

Here the fact that al” =a") =0 for n=0,1 is used. On substituting equations (2.19) into
equations (2.20), we have

a?) = -ona), (2.214)
a?) = —o3a?) + 3 (w3 — w2) ua?) (2.21b)
and a = -oya) + 4 (w4 — 3) ua?

— 6 [(w4 + 2 — 2eos)uu + (04 — @2)(1 — 63] a). (2.21)

The only difference with the previous model without temperature scaling [9,10] is the additional
factor of 1 — @ in equation (2.21c).

(e) Space-time discretization

To numerically solve equation (2.8), the time and spatial derivatives on the left-hand side must be
discretized. Integrating using the first-order forward-Euler scheme from t = 0 to 1, we have

file + &,t +1) —fi(x, ) = 2(f))- (2.22)

It is well known [6] that the effect of the implicit second-order error can be absorbed into
the dissipation term, effectively making the scheme second-order accurate with a viscosity
proportional to t + 1/2 instead of r.
