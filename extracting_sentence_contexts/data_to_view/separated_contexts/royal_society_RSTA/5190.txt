Is the set sing(d) for a minimizer of Oseen—Frank energy 6or in theorem 1.1 a set of
finite points? The main difficulty in investigating the size of singular set of minimizers d to the Oseen—-Frank
energy functional 4, is that it is an open question whether an energy monotonicity inequality,
similar to that of harmonic maps [7], holds for d. In fact, the following seemingly simple question
remains open. Question 1.5. Assume kq = —kp and max, <j<3 |k; — 1| K 1.
