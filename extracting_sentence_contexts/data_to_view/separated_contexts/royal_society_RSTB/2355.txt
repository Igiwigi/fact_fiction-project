8314 DR. D, H. SCOTT ON THE STRUCTURE AND AFFINITIES

pedicel, with no indications of an integument. The latter, in fact, seems to have
had the shape of a coal-scoop, forming a sheath in which the distal end of the
sporangium was seated but not completely inclosed. *

The word “integument” has been used in speaking of the sheaths of the micro-
sporangia, because these envelopes, though comparatively little developed, appear to be
homologous, as indicated by structure and position, with the complete integument of the
mature megasporangium in the female Lepidocarpon. It is a point of considerable
interest to find, in a microsporangiate strobilus, so clear an indication of the same
structure, which, in the case of the megasporangia of Lepidocarpon, had developed
further, and led to the formation of the seed-like organ.
