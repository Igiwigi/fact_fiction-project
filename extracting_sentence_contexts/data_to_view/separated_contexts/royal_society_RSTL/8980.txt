'The question has been (up to a certain point) discussed in
Part T. Section VIII., where a Table is given of these exceptions {Part I. Sec-
tion VIII. (3)]. I shall not enter on the former class of exceptions, not only for the reason that the
difficulties presented by them are not peculiar to this method, but also that these
obstacles are rapidly being removed by a careful scrutiny of the facts, and 80 many 8uch
obstacles have actually disappeared that the removal of the rest must be regarded simply
as a question of time and trouble. The second class of exceptions, however, stands on
a very different footing. They go to the very root of the matter, and no rational expla-
nation of these exceptions has (8 far as I am aware) been ever suggested from the
present point of view of chemistry.
