This inference is borne out by the investigations to be related, which prove to
throw much light upon the development of enamels other than those of Marsupials.
In those Marsupials in which but few tubes enter the enamel, there is often little or
no dilatation at the point of passage, nor is there any marked deviation in direction,

but in the Macropods there is usually a well-marked dilatation at this point, and
there is usually also a sharp bend; there is, in fact, what might almost be described
as a clumsy joint ; this is noticeable, though to a less extent, in Hyrax.

In Macropus there is also a peculiarity in the course of the tubes in their passage
through the enamel, at all events in certain regions of the tooth; not only do they
pursue gently curved courses, but about one-third of the distance between the‚Äù
surface of the dentine and that of the enamel, they all simultaneously take abrupt
bends in more than one plane, which brings them into a course sometimes almost
circumferential to the long axis of the tooth; hence, on the same slide they may be
seen both in longitudinal and transverse section.

This peculiarity proved to be of great service in unravelling the nature and
position of the tubes, as it was possible thus to check the appearances seen in
