The degeneracy of the minimum signals the phase invariance of the free oscillations, as no
angle is preferred. Now, imagine that we rock” that potential in a periodic way around some
axis, say qz, and that rocking is sufficiently fast. Where would the fictitious particle tend to
rest (remind that the particle motion is damped)? It is evident that this would happen at the
quietest regions, where the rocking of the potential produces less perturbation, i.e. around any of
the ‘poles’ symmetrically located along the q2-axis (figure 1). Then, an initially phase invariant
oscillator would end up being a phase-bistable one!
