Clarke, who has found certainâ€™ morphological
changes typical of a stressed condition. So far, however, there is no experimental evidence
that the young of stressed females have a reduced longevity or fertility.

(b) Synchrony

If all properties of a fluctuation in numbers were accounted for by an intraspecific
process, separate populations would fluctuate independently. In fact, there is a strong
tendency for similar states of abundance to occur over larger areas than seems likely by
pure chance. Exceptions are important in showing that no regular climatic cycle can be
directly responsible for the mortality; but the tendency for separate units to be in phase
must be due to some co-ordinating process. It has been shown that some form of intraspecific strife seems to be the process control-
ling population density.
