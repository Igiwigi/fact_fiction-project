the cortex cerebri. The lower limb of the rich ganglionic tract extending from the
frontal pole along the limbic fizsure beyond the Sylvian depression, possesses cells of
a 8maller 8ize than those of the corresponding upper tract. Thus in front of the
corpus callosum the nerve-cells near the limbic fissure measure 27p X 17p, as contrasted
with 32k X 16p for those of the upper tract ; "behind the Sylvian depression those
of the lower tract measure 27þ X17, whilsb those of the upper track measure
34pX17p.

The rich aggregation of cells in the ganglionic layer along the median exposed
portion of the vault results in a deep stratum, which near the frontal extremity
measures *558 mm., and posteriorly and internal to the superior parietal snleus
604 mm. Tf this be contrasted with the pale, solitary belt in five-laminated realms,
measuring but '186 mm., its wealth of structure will be apparent, Another fact to be
noted is that this layer of ganglionic cells is both deep (604 mm.) and rich in cells in
that area of the granule formation bounded externally by the primary parietal suleus,
and covers the median surface of this posterior region of the hemisphere as far back as
the summit of the occipital pole. We must therefore conelude that although the
ganglionie cells (next to those near the occipital pole) are the largest throughoub the
cortex cerebri, the distinctive feature relative to this formation is not the large 8ize
attained by the cells, as is the case in the highest of the Mammalian 8eries—for they
exhibit in the Rabbit, as in the Pig and Sheep, a remarkable uniformity throughout ;
but, on the other hand, this formation is especially notable for its richness in nerve-
