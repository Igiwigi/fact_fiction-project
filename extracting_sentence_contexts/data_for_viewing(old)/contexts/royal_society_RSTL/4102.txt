In an adult male I fonnd that the two vocal ligaments, when divested of mucous
membrane, weigh one grain, which is scarcely one-half their weight by theory ; hence
it appears that a considerable portion of mucous membrane is connected with the
vocal cord in the production of sound, which agrees with the anatomy of these parts.

It is now necessary to offer some explanation respecting the vital state of the yocal
ligaments. The state of repose is the ordinary condition of the vocal ligament in the
living subject, when the voice is not exercised ; but we must not therefore conclude
it to be incapable of further contraction. In fact, the state of repose during life is a
state of tension, for the ligaments' being connected with the thyro-arytenoid mascles,
not in a few points, but continuously thronghout their whole length, must obey the
motions of these muscles, which, like all muscles, are in a state of tension during re-
pose. We also know by experience that when we produce a sound lower than the
usual pitch of our voice, the crico-thyroid chink is opened principally by the con-
traction of the same muscles, and the ligaments must therefore at the same time be
relaxed. It appears, then, both from the anatomy and physiology of the human
larynx, that the ordinary state of the vocal cords is one of considerable tension,
which admits of being lessened, and thereby produces the range of lower notes. If
we suppose the glottis to be partially closed when we are talking, that is at the ordi-
Hary pitch of our voice, and to be more opened as the tones become graver, this of
course will cooperate with the relaxation of the yocal cords. In the production of
