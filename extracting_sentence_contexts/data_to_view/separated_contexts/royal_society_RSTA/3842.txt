This is known as “the lava bed,” and the accumulation is said to be the product of

_ the eruption of 1812. Before that time the river is believed to have flowed more or
less continuously, but since then it often dries up for weeks together, and its flow is
considerable only after rains. That at Wallibu so much more water should be found
than in the larger stream at Rabaka is certainly a curious fact, and one for which it is
not possible to offer an explanation without making a thorough study of the geology
and physical features of its drainage area—an investigation which could not be
undertaken in the present condition of affairs. In the upper part of the Rabaka Dry River enormous accumulations of hot sand
have been piled up exactly like those already described in the Wallibu Valley
(see Plate 32). °
