(1) Elongated cells very indistinctly seen in figure 6G, but which in favourable speci-
mens seem to be about 124 broad and of considerable length. These cells may belong to
the inner epidermis of the integument.

(2) Large cells with finely marked outlines, often 60 broad, 304 long. They are very
distinct in the specimen shown in figure 6G. These cells are thought to belong to the
epidermis of the nucellus.

(3) In occasional specimens there are patches of small isodiametric cells 30‚Äù wide
with broad, dark outlines. These cells are distinct from those of group (2) above,
which are recognizable in the same specimens, and there is nothing to indicate their
nature. The fact that they are as a rule not represented at all suggests that they

are not a cutinized layer, but an unresistant layer occasionally impregnated with fat
during decay.


A REVISION OF WILLIAMSONIELLA 325

Seed development. In young gynoecia, the only part of the ovule which can be demon-
strated is the cutinized apex of the micropyle which is almost fully developed. More of
the micropyle is developed in older fruits, and by stage 4 (p. 319) the micropyle has
developed fully. At this stage the inner parts of the seed become distinctly cutinized. The
whole integument is almost cylindrical, about 0-3 mm. wide and 1-3 mm. long, of which
