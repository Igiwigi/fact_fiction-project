with the Set Q, and 60* Faur. with the Set R. They cannot, therefore,
be attributable to inertness of the fecundating agent, or of the object to be fecundated,
occasioned by an unfavourable temperature of the surrounding medinm. The fact
of the occurrence of segmentation in 8ome ova, but not in the majority of the ova of
different experiments, as in Q 1, 2, 3 and 4, seems further to show that the influence
of the momentary application of the potash solution was produced chiefly, and in the
first instance, on the spermatozoa, or impregnating bodies, and not s0 immediately
on the ova; since if the ova had been first, or most affected, none of them, probably,
would have become impregnated. Further, I may perhaps be allowed to remark, that the arrest of impregnation was
due mainly to the nature of the chemical agent employed; and the extent of inter-
ference with the fecundatory process was in proportion to the more or less immediate
action of this agent on the spermatozoon. Thus we have seen that but few ova were
impregnated when the solutions of caustic potass were employed; but when the
nitrate of potass was used as in Q 7, forty-three out of seventy-seven ova were SCg-
mented ; while in R 6, 7 and 8, in which the total number of ova was two hundred
and twelve, there were fifty-three segmented, and these produced forty-seven embryos.
