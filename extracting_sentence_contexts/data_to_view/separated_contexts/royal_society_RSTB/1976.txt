As soon as the gelatine was completely melted the contents of the
infected tube were poured into the first dish, the contents of the second tube were
added to the first, shaken, and then poured into the second dish, and so on, until the
6 plates constituting the series were prepared, the first tube being used each time
as the source of infection. It is evident that by this method the first dish, which
we may designate as Plate A, would receive the greater part of the germs contained
in the first tube, while enough would remain in the few drops left in that tube
thoroughly to infect the gelatine from the second tube. As a matter of fact Plates A
and B are usually overcrowded, and Plate F is liable to be blank, but the inter
mediate ones may be relied upon to produce a few well-isolated colonies. In the initial cultures various acid media were used, such as malt-gelatine, yeast
