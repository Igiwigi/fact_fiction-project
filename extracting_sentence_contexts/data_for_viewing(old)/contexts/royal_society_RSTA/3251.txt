featuring the chiral SU(2) symmetry and giving room for two different Yukawa couplings /t and
hy; here, ¢¢ = io2$* is the charge-conjugated scalar. The measured mass of the bottom quark 1m, ~
4.2 GeV is used to implicitly fix the UV initial condition for the bottom Yukawa coupling at the
cut-off scale Ip 4.

It is instructive to first study the IR window, ie. the range of accessible values for the Higgs
mass within the class of bare ¢4 potentials [14]. The result is shown in figure 2a (black solid lines
for 42,4 =0 and 42,4 = 100) and compared to the Z2-symmetric model (red dashed lines) studied
before. We observe that the conventional lower bound of the two models are almost identical. This
confirms the usefulness of the simple Zz Yukawa model for the purpose of studying the lower
bound. The reason for this agreement simply lies in the fact that the bottom Yukawa coupling is
much smaller than that of the top quark, with the latter dominating the dynamics near the lower
bound. The situation is different at large Higgs self-coupling: here, the different number of scalar
degrees of freedom plays a substantial role which leads to a narrowing of the IR window, now
having its centre near 200 GeV.

This model is also of interest, because it is used for non-perturbative studies of the Higgs
mass bounds in lattice simulations [34-37]. The chiral gauge structure of the standard model is so


far not accessible on the lattice, but this chiral model suffices to address quantitative questions,
while extrapolating to the full standard model with the aid of perturbation theory. In fact, the
same mechanism for relaxing the conventional lower bound by means of higher-order operators
