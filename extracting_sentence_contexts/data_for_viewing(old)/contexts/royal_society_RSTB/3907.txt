more efficiently as a centre of distribution? Lying in the angle between right
appendix and superior cava a radial spread at once inyolves the superior cava, the
tenia terminalis, the right appendix, the septum, and the band which leads to the
left appendix. The tania, taking a straight course to the inferior cava, forms a base
from which the pectinate bands sweep slightly away around the body of the right
auricle ; it terminates above near the head of the node where muscle bands stream in
like the ribs of a fan and concentrate from appendix, body of right auricle, septum
and inter-auricular band, eager to act as outgoing messengers (figs. 8, 13, 16, and 21).
The collection of fibres at this region is remarkable ; we name this focus the “ concen-
tration point.”

A discussion as to whether right or left auricle first contracts is evidently
unprofitable in the face of our facts. Certain portions of the right auricle contract
before certain portions of the left auricle, and vice versd.

Rare or PropaGation or THE Excrratory Process.

Preliminary Observations.

The rate at which the excitatory process travels through the musculature of the
heart has been measured by earlier workers in one of two ways. We may, in
describing them, conveniently follow SANDERSON and PaGer’s description (12), for the
methods as they describe them are the most accurate. The ventricle is excited “ at
the apex («), and led off by one contact (/) at the base and by one of two contacts
(m and m’), which occupy different distances between x and f.” The leads taken are
