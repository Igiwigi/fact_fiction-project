The proof of corollary 2.3 follows from the fact that equation (2.4) is the necessary and sufficient : =
condition for V(T) to be concave for any constant relative risk aversion utility function. The :8
concave curvature of V(T) comes from the (weakly) concave shape of the constant relative risk : 5
aversion utility function, which more than compensates for the maximum permissible concavity : <
of the damage function given condition (2.4). Given concavity for V(T), from corollary 2.2, greater Do
uncertainty (an MPS) implies greater WTP to avoid climate change. : Ss
We can apply result 2.1 directly to the IPCCâ€™s altered descriptions of climate sensitivity.
