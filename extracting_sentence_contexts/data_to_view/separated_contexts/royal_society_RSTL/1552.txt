The
plant, on the contrary, if it could feel and perceive the objects
of its wants, and will the possession of them, has still to con-
trive and form the organ by which these are to be approached. The writers who have contended for the existence of sensa-
tion in plants, appear to have been sensible of the preceding
and other obstacles, and have all betrayed the weakness of
their hypothesis, in adducing a few facts only which are fa-
vourable to it, and waving wholly the investigation of all
others. In the description of the preceding experiments, I fear that
I have been tediously minute ; but, as I have selected a few
facts only from a great number, which I could have adduced,
I was anxious to give as accurate and distinct a view of those
I stated, as possible. I am, dear Sir,
with great respect,
sincerely yours,
