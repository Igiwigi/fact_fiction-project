It is apparently not mentioned by Owen in his memoirs on the Moa,
but was described and figured, in 1874, by Coucurrey (8a), in the remarkably perfect, and, indeed,
unique feet of D. ingens, now in the Otago University Museum. It is also present on both sides in a
very fine “individual” skeleton of D. robustus, in the same collection. Covanrrey describes the liga-
mentous attachments of the bone, which, following Owen, he calls a “calcaneo-sesamoid.” Bouter
(8, vol. 1, p. 32, and vol. 2, p. 334), describes and figures it as an “astragalus-like bone,” in a foot of
D. elephantopus, in the Cambridge Museum, and mentions its occurrence in the well-known skeleton of
D. robustus, in the York Museum ; he refers to Coucurrey’s paper, but has overlooked the fact that the
bone is described there, stating that it has not hitherto been noticed in Dinornis. There is another point in the structure of the foot of Dinornis which is often wrongly stated in
authoritative publications. Von Haasr erroneously concluded that the Dinornithide as restricted by
him, differed from the Palapterygide in the absence of a hallux, but as Hurron showed in 1876 (15), and
as is abundantly proved by the collections in the Otago University Museum, this is not the case, many
individual feet of Dinornithide having been found with a well-developed ballux.
