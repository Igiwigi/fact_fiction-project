By means of an excess of ammonia, the pink red precipitate which first forms may
be totally redissolved, giving a colourless solution, from which by evaporation, a salt
is deposited on cooling, in colourless rectangular prisms. The existence of this salt
has been long known, and as its analysis has been recently published by FenranG,
I need not detail any of my own experimental results, which fully coincide with his.
The formula of this body is Pd CI + 2 N H, + H O, or rationally, according to the
principles I have elsewhere laid down for the copper salts, NH,.Cl + PdO.NUH,.
When gently heated it evolves water and ammonia, and leaves the yellow substance
Pd CI + N Hz. The same decomposition may be effected by evaporating its soJu-
tion to dryness, in which case the yellow salt generally crystallizes in cubes. Were
it not hazardous to draw any inference with regard to the isomorphism of bodies be-
longing to the regular system, I should notice this fact as illustrative of the equiva-
lency of Pd CI. N H, with K. By a very cautious application of heat to the colour-
less erystallized salt, s0me water may be expelled before the ammonia begins to come
off, but T have never succeeded in rendering it quite anhydrous. It however partially
assumes the formula N H,.Cl + Pd.N H,, to which we $hall find the ammonia-
Sulphate of palladium to present an equiyalent.

By the action of solutions of caustic potash on solutions of these ammonia-chlorides
of palladium, a variety of products are formed, according to the proportions employed
and the circumstances of temperature. For the complete investigation of these bo-
dies I have not yet accumulated materials, but the results which have been already
obtained are not without interest as indicative of the analogies of palladium to other
metals whose laws of combination are better known. I shall consequently describe
