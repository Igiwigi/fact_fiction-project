but only in virtue of their own qualities, of their own struc-
ture. And, importantly, icons are abstract schematizations of
the structural features of what they represent. A portrait of
a man iconically represents him, but it does not have blood
or bones as its constituent elements. In the same vein, a dia-
gram can represent the trend of sales of a car company but it
is not made out of real cars.

We propose that the mechanism of Embodied Simulation,
presented in the previous section, can be described as an
iconic sign. This is so because simulations can be considered
as natural signs whose denotative relation depends on their
similarity with the objects or events they refer to.â€™ In fact,
simulations are not arbitrary signs, i.e. they are not symbols,
nor they can be classified as indexes (they do sometimes also
imply a spatio-temporal contiguity with the object or event
they refer to, but this is not the norm nor it is an essential
feature, as simulation routines can be triggered also by ima-
gined objects, facts and events or even, to a certain degree,
by their linguistic descriptions) [26]. Simulation routines are
the ground for similarity relations that depend only on the
qualities of the simulations themselves, i.e. they depend on
structural characteristics of the simulations. Most impor-
tantly, as it is the case for icons, simulation routines can be
considered filtered signs. In fact, they are not actions or per-
