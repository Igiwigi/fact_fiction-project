These differences in the value of « may arise from the lunar declination not being

being slightly inexact. But it is by no means improbable that they are the discrepan-
cies, arising from mechanical principles, which exist between the tides of water in
motion and the results of the equilibrium-hypothesis. The general agreement of the
equilibrium-theory with the facts (assuming « = 2") is near enough to be very re-
markable. It may be possible, by additional care and labour, to bring the solar inter-
polated curves nearer to the oþbservations, preserving the requisite conditions : but I
conceive that enough has been done to establish the general law. I 4.
