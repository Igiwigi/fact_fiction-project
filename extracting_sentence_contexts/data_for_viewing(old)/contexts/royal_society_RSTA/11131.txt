The First Hypothesis of the Lippmann-Helmholtz Theory.

The first hypothesis would apply to any electrolytic cell consisting of two polariz-
able electrodes placed in a conducting solution. When an E.M.F. (of which the value
is kept within certain limits depending on the nature of the electrodes and of the
solution) is applied to such a cell there may be a considerable current for a very short
time ; but the system almost at once assumes a practically steady state in which there
is only a very feeble continuous current through the cell. The value of this current
can in general be neglected in comparison with the current value found by dividing
the E.M.F. applied by the calculable resistance of the electrolyte. It is therefore
considered that the potential fall within the liquid can be neglected in comparison
with the sum of the potential changes in the neighbourhood of the electrodes, and
that this sum is equal in value to the applied E.M.F. The system is, in fact,
considered equivalent to a pair of condensers (supposed existent at the surfaces of
separation between electrode and solution) connected in series by a resistance (repre-
sented by the resistance of the electrolyte). For electrodes of the same nature in the
same solution the respective capacities are taken to be proportional to the areas of the
surfaces in contact with the solution. In the capillary electrometer, therefore, the
capacity of one electrode would in general be indefinitely small compared with that of
the other.

Let AA’ and BB’ represent condensers (of capacities C, and C,) of which the plates
