Foreword

The science of sea-level rise is currently a very hot topic. Whether we like it or
not, it is now firmly on the public agenda in a way that few other areas of science
manage to achieve. Blockbuster films like The Day After Tomorrow have seen to
it that concerns about climate change are now familiar to everyone. On the other
1zand, certain authors of popular fiction have pontificated that the threat of
1uman-induced climate change and sea-level rise is a ‘myth’—though what on
Earth they know about the topic is anybody’s guess.

The subject is vitally important. If current projections of likely increases in
sea-level under a ‘business as usual’ climate-change scenario turn out to be even
approximately correct (as I believe they will), the implications for human society
are profound, and deeply (literally!) worrying, because the costs of adaptation
and mitigation by humankind will be enormous. They will make the already
difficult debates going on in the UK about phased retreat, and the possible
abandonment of coastal villages and other infrastructure, look like a stroll in the
park.
