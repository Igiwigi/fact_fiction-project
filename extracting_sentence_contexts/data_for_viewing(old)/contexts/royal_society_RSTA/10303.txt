by the National Physical Laboratory, curves of corrections were drawn, from which
the corrections to the thermometer readings at any temperature could be read off
with an accuracy of ‘01° C. A small correction had to be applied on account of the
difference in the temperature of the water-jacket in these experiments and when the
thermometer was standardised. This was found by calculation, taking the coefficient
of apparent expansion of mercury in glass as ‘00016. The correction on this account
was never greater than ‘04° C,

The method of heating with the vapours of boiling liquids worked extremely well.
The jacket would take from 3 to 4 hours to arrive at a constant temperature, and
then neither thermometer would vary by ‘05° C. even in the worst cases, and it often
happened that both thermometers remained absolutely steady for hours. It is a
curious fact that the corrected readings of the two thermometers were rarely the
same. The difference was generally less than ‘1° C., but sometimes the upper and
sometimes the lower one would indicate the higher value. In calculating the results,
the temperature of the wire was always assumed to be that of the upper
thermometer, while the lower thermometer was taken as indicating the temperature
of the vibrator.

Timing the Vibrations by a Method of Coincidences.

The method used consists in observing the reflections of a vertical flash occurring
once a second, in two mirrors, one of which is fixed in position, and the other is
attached to the vibrating plate and vibrates with it, swinging just above the fixed
mirror and being parallel to it when at rest. The reflections are observed by a
