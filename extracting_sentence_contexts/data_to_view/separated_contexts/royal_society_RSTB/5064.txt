in the structure of eastern China are the existence of two great Sinian blocks of pre-
Cambrian rocks, one to the N. and one to the S., of which the latter extends south-
westward into Cambodia and the Malay Peninsula. The nucleus of this South China
block consists of areas of gneiss; they were united by Paleozoic rocks and the whole
welded by Hercynian folding. The typical parts of China lie between these northern
and southern blocks; and the land near the southern block has been disturbed by
Kainozoic folding.
