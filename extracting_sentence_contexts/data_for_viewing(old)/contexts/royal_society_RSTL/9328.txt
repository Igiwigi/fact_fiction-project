In the American account of their Kerguelen collections, it is stated by Dr.
Kidder (Bull. U. $8. Nat. Mus. #i., p. 89) that he has only sueceeded in finding a
record of four specimens of this species in European collections. The writer has
omitted to notice that in the British Museum © List of Anseres,” &c. (p. 52), pub-
lished by the late Mr. G. R. Gray in 1844, no less than seven specimens are
mentioned, and I now give a complete list of the birds at present in the national
collection. I would call attention to the fact that the bird from the Orozettes
seems to have darker legs than the Kerguelen hird : whether this occurs only in the
dried skin, or is to be found in the living Sheathbill, must be left for future visitors
to these islands to determine.
