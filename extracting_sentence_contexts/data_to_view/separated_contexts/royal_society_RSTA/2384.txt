Thus

which is easily seen to agree with the result given by Brown, or by Apams, ‘ Coll. Works,’ L., p. 187, when we take account of the fact that

r—n! 2ixé = Qik (n—n’') t = Qic z nt,

so that, in terms of the quantity denoted by g,

«=4(1+m)g. This example is chiefly useful here as calling attention to the fact that n’, while
not exactly equal to 1, is near to it, and consequently the factor d/(n?—1) is only
small of the first order in m,.
