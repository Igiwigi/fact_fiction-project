Weak values were introduced as outcomes of weak measurements [1], which have large : 2
uncertainty in the pointer position. Thus, in experiments, the weak value is obtained as a =
statistical average of the pointer readings. Even among proponents of this concept, the weak value S
is frequently understood as a mere generalization of the expectation value for the case when the 73
quantum system is post-selected, i.e. a conditional expectation value [71,72]. : S

Contrary to the classical case, if we are given a single system in which a quantum variable has ih
a known definite eigenvalue, we cannot test this fact with certainty. We cannot distinguish with : 4
certainty between this situation and a case in which we started in a superposition which included 23
this eigenvalue. Still there is some certainty about this situation: we know that a measurement a
of this variable will yield the eigenvalue with certainty.
