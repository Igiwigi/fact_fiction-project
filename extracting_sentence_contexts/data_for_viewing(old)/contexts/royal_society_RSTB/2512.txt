alone moves upwards. This is even the case in Birds, and it is only in the Mammalia
that instantaneous shutting and opening, or blinking, has been developed.

2. The retractor muscle ot the eyebulb is ot frequent occurrence, notably in
Marsupials, Edentates, Rodents, and Ungulates, ie., chiefly in the lower orders.
Vestiges of such muscles in Monkeys have already been recorded by Owen.

3. Opaque Nerve Fibres.â€”-The most common occurrence as a normal condition in
other animals of that which in ourselves is regarded as a congenital defect, is a
diminished transparency of the nerve fibre layer as it radiates from the disc. A slight

developed nictitans would lend support to the above view, for if its habits be considered it is obvious that

its eyes especially require protection from ants and grit.

degree of opacity is met with in the Negroes and all dark-haired races, and in a
number of Simis, and we find semi-transparent nerve fibres distributed throughout
all the Orders. Opaque nerve fibres are most marked in some of the Rodents, more
