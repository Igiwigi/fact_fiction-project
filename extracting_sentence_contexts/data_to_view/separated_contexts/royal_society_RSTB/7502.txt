The theory does not make any
new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account

matics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be
experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in
text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.
