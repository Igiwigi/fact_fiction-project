Objective 4: Proof identity must be independent from the syntax of proof systems.

3. From Proof theory to a theory of proofs

In the previous two sections, I argued that Hilbert’s 24th problem, or the problem of proof identity,
is highly relevant for modern computer science, and I discussed some properties that a reasonable
notion of proof identity should have, in order to be useful for certain applications. But so far, it is
not clear how such a notion could be found and whether it is possible to meet the four objectives
discussed above. One might even be inclined to think that the non-existence of our desired notion
of proof identity is inherently caused by the very nature of proof theory.

In this section, I will argue that the problem is a mathematical problem that can be solved
by mathematical means. In fact, there exist already two fundamentally different approaches for

° Although in propositional logic a tableau proof can be seen as an ‘upside-down’ sequent calculus proof, this is no longer the
case for more expressive logics [49]. It seems that we need more sophisticated versions of sequent calculi and tableau systems,
in order to recover this upside-down correspondence.


freeing proofs from the syntactic yoke of proof systems, and both have the potential to enable us
eventually to speak of a theory of proofs, instead of a theory of proof systems.

In the first approach, we define the properties of proofs and their interactions via axioms, in a
similar way as it is done in abstract algebra. In most cases, this leads to some kind of category of
proofs [20,21]. Let us call this first approach the axiomatic approach. The second approach tries to
