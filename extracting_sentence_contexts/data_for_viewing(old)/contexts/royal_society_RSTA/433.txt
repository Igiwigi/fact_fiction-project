this case, IT = Pa + pcg(h/2 +r) © pegr, because P, * 0 given the Moon’s lack of atmosphere, and
h <r. Then, the wavelength and timescale for the least stable folding mode are

h 2uAph
aman [PE and t= A, (3.14)
Ap 3pegr?

respectively. Using pc © 2700kg/m3, Ap/pe © 1, g=1.6m/s?, r= 1740 km, hh = 20 — 100 km, then
Am % 800 — 2000 km and ty, < 0.2 years.

Condition 2 is if contraction of the crust keeps pace with contraction of the magma ocean.
In this case, 1) = tg =2u7r/r, where 7 is given by the contraction rate. The contraction rate
is determined by the fact that the net planetary mass M= fap is conserved, where / is
the planet’s mean density, which changes during freezing and contraction (see §2a); we thus
obtain 7/r= —4,/p, and therefore tj = —3 p/p. In this case, IT = pegh/2 + 3up/p. Using pc=
2700 kg m3, g=16 ms~? and h=100km,  ~10!* Pas, then 79 is only comparable to pegh/2
if p/p > 10-7 yr}, ie. if the contraction timescale is shorter than about 100 years, which is
unlikely; thus, we assume p.gh/2 >> 3up /p and thus, IT ~ p-gh/2. In this case, the wavelength
and timescale for the least-stable folding mode are
