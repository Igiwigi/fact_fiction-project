The characteristic velocity of E

which is the same as the characteristic velocity of ETP: U+V — U. On the other hand, for ETDe+
with (6, c) = (K + U,R) or (K + U, V), we obtain

It is required that the principal subsystems satisfy the subcharacteristic condition [45]. In fact, the
condition in the present case:

ut? p, (9,0) +

a=R, b=V forcY > ck

a=V, b=R for cR > cY ‘

is satisfied since cK+U < cK+U+a < ¢K+U+b <¢,,


The bulk viscosity in Erp Rt is the same as the one of ET7 for (R + V)-process (3.8). On the
other hand, the bulk viscosity in ETO et with (6, c) =(K + U,R) or (K + U,V) is given by

5. ET! theory for a specific dense gas

We study ET} with specific equations of state: equations are in the form of virial expansion and
equations of van der Waals.
