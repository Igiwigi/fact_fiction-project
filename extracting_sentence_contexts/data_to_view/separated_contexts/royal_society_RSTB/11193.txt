Special needs teachers
who specialize in helping dyscalculic learners in the UK
describe their own multisensory methods and their focus
on designing interventions for each individual learner
[105-107]. However, these methods have not been subject
to systematic evaluation. In fact, the present UK government and its immediate
Conservative predecessors do not officially recognize dys-
calculia. The previous references have been removed, and
now the only reference on the Department for Education
website is to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency,
where it is stated that dyscalculia does not prevent someone
from getting a driving licence. There is also a link to the
Department for Work and Pensions about discrimination
in employment.
