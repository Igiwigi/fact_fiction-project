(a) Diverse financial footprints: Given the wide disparity in financial capability and
capacity in India, how are FinTech models trained?

(b) Accounting for bias in data: Much of the disparity mentioned above is a function of
systemic and historical bias. How do developers intend to correct for such bias, if at
all? Is this a consideration developers are made mindful of? If so, how?

(c) Unequal collection: Given that having financial data is a function of privilege, how
do developers ensure that this inevitable imbalance of whose data is collected and
from where, is addressed?

(d) Data margins: What deliberation has occurred to address the fact that a large
majority of Indians live at the margins of data collection, either because they are
physically remote or digitally excluded?

(e) Consent: One idea to address some of the considerations above could be to collect
more data or include people in datasets. At this juncture, particularly with State
applications of FinTech (if any), how do we ensure that consent of individuals is not
undermined? Inclusion with agency is integral, what processes and strategies are
put in place for this?

(f) Proxies: How can proxies for protected characteristics be addressed?

(g) Security: What safeguards are put in place to protect userâ€™s financial data?
