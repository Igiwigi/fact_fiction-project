and consequently, if we call T the resultant in respect to , y, we have
+1 =p"go(o—g)(r—0)(g—r"),
and
P=pgtriri(o—g)(r—o)(pmr}
=p*(o—g)(r—oY(g—ry Te.

(43) Thus we ee that the two quantities G, T*, which are both rational integral
functions of the degree 36 in the coefficients of F(w, y), cannot one vanish without the
other, at all events when L is not equal to zero. This is sufficient to show that they are
identical to a numerical factor pres, whatever L may be, zero or not zero(®), and con-
sequently that the quantity called G, proved to be positive upon the supposition of L
not being zero, must also remain positive when L is zero, because it is in fact the square
of a rational function of the coefficients. But we may also prove this independently
by virtue of the supplementary reduced form au*+5eur'+fv* applicable to the cage of
L zero.

For when L=0, G becomes JK*; s0 that the condition © G not negative” implies
8wply that J is positive unless K vanishes.

Now the canonizant, when it does not vanish, i. e. when & is not zero, contains v% as
a factor, and, its coefficients being real, v, v are both of them necessarily real functions
of x, y. Consequently J, which by definition is —4 x discriminant of quadratic cova-
riant, becomes —4p” x discriminant of au(eu+fv) in respect to w, v, which =w"%af*, w
being real. Consequently J is positive, since the reality of v, v implies that of «, e, f,
