musculus constrictor ven jugularis interne,‚Äù enervated by a special nerve supply,
whereby the three vessels can be considerably constricted, and the venous pressure
in the head greatly increased. The apparatus is useful, apparently, in helping in the
operation of shedding the skin. The muscles are fairly easily seen in Lacerta and
Tropidonotus, but are not quite so obvious in Sphenodon; they can be made very
plain, however, in the following way. If the anterior region of the internal jugular,
with a good piece of the ends of both mandibular and posterior cerebral veins, be
dissected out, and any coagulated blood in them washed out and the preparation
placed in a glass dish of alcohol containing a little glycerine, the muscles can readily
be made out. When viewed by transmitted light, the ordinary parts of the vein
wall appear moderately transparent and thin-walled, but, in the region occupied by
the muscle, the walls of the vessels are very much thicker and more opaque.
Transverse sections through the various regions also bring out quite clearly the fact
that the bases of both mandibular and posterior cerebral vein, and of the internal
jugular in the vicinity, are enveloped by a conspicuous coat of striate muscle, just as
Bruner described in other Saurians. The condition of the specimens did not allow
of detailed examination of its nerve supply, but, as it lies quite close to the ganglion

glossopharyngei, as in Lacerta, the nerves to the muscle, nervi tumefactores capitis,
are doubtless fairly similar. For the same reason, the connection of the muscle with
the skeleton, if present, could not be satisfactorily ascertained,

I also find myself in agreement with Bruner with regard to the late appearance of
these muscles during the course of development, for they are but feebly shown in the
oldest stage I have examined (Stage 8 of Denpy).
