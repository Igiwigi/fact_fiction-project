complete account of the subject than has yet been given for any reptile, I have

Ss decided to offer my results for publication as a separate memoir, without waiting for
‘2 the completion of my work on the pineal organs.
2 The blood-vessels have been investigated partly by dissection and partly by means

a of serial sections, and such completeness of detail as I have been able to attain is
a very largely due to the adoption of a method of fixing and hardening which I have
5 found to have many advantages both for the study of the vascular system and of
S the brain itself. By this method the entire contents of the cranial cavity are fixed
s and hardened 7m situ, and are then in excellent condition either for dissection or
& for histological purposes. The application of the method in the case of Sphenodon
= is greatly facilitated by the fact that the brain does not occupy nearly the whole of

S the cranial cavity, a large subdural space being left, especially above the brain, across
3 which numerous blood-vessels run, together with delicate strands of connective tissue
3 which connect the dura mater with the pia.

5 The animal is killed by chloroform, and the eyeballs are carefully removed from the
8 orbits with as little loss of blood as possible. An incision is then made on each side

in the cartilaginous wall which separates the cranial cavity from the orbit (at the point
marked « in fig. 3, Plate 31), Through the incisions thus made the fixing fluid is
gently injected into the cranial cavity by means of a pipette. The fluid used is
acetic bichromate, made up according to the formula given by Boties Lex, viz. :—
