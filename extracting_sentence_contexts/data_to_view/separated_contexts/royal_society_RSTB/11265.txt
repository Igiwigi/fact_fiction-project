1. Introduction

Abstract words allow us to convey important human ideas like scientific
(e.g. theory, calculus) and social (e.g. justice) concepts, and extend our capacity
e-mail: pexman@ucalgaty.ca to convey ideas beyond the physical reality of the here and now. Despite the
fact that abstract words make up the majority of our lexicon [1], empirical studies
of word meaning have historically focused on studying concrete words (e.g. truck;
[2-4]). There are intuitive differences between concrete and abstract words: our
understanding of truck unfolds against the physical reality in which we operate. We can perceive concrete referents through various senses and we can physically
interact with them.
