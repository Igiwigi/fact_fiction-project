Hence the conclusion (se below, I\ 102 and 103), that the Vitreous Electricity
carries heat with it in brass, which I anticipated three years ago from the mechanical
theory Â®, is now established by a direct experimental demonstration.

PART 11. ON THERMO-ELECTRIC INVERSIONS.

78. Cunmmince's discovery of thermo-electric inyersions having afforded the special
foundation of that part of the theory by which I ascertained the general fact of
electric convection in metals, and eyery observation of a thermo-electric inversion
being a perfect test as to the relative positions of the two metals between which it is
observed in the Table of Convections (see below, \ 103), I was induced to make experi-
ments with a view to finding new instances of inversion, and to determine in each case,
with some degree of precision, the temperature at which the two metals are thermo-
electrically neutral to one another.

79. In the experiments on thermo-electric inversion described by Cumming, and
by BzcquesEr, the only other experimenter, s0 far as I am aware, who has published
observations on the subject, one junction between the two metals is generally kept
cool, while the other is raised until the current indicated by the galvanometer,
instead of going on increasing, begins to diminish, comes to a stop, and then sets in
