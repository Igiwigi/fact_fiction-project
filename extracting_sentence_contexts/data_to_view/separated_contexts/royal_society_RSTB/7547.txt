The
existence of a maximum compensatory height due to failure to resolve the elements in the
background pattern is, however, suggested by the failure of responses among locusts over
water, by contrast with their behaviour at the same height and in the same wind over
nearby land (pp. 192-193 and 208). In the field, where, of course, the wind speed
varies all the time, one would not expect to see a constant failure of responses above any
particular level, but would expect rather to find a tendency for responsiveness to decrease
with height. Thus, the existence of a maximum compensatory height, due to the apparent
ground speed being too low even when the background pattern is resolvable, is in fact
suggested by the observations that stronger winds were required to evoke responses from
higher than from lower fliers (pp. 177, 179 and 185). The same observations suggest that

insufficient retinal velocity, rather than the indistinctness of the background pattern, was
what usually set the height limit to optomotor responses over land. The numerical data summarized in figure 11 (p. 191) further support the supposition of
responsiveness decreasing with height, but increasing with wind speed at a given height.
