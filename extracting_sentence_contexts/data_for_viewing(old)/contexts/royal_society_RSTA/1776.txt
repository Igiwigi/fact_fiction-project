direct links to nuclear testing, more stringent requirements are driven into the method, which
seeks to compensate by use of better calculations validated by increasingly pertinent non-nuclear
experiments.

The multi-physics calculations at the core of the method are therefore continually refined
to improve the fidelity of the representations, in effect removing or reducing approximations
and replacing empirical elements with predictive capability. In turn, this improvement in
calculations drives ever increasing demands for computational resource, and AWE’s high-
performance computers (HPC) operate today at 8petaflop/s (8 million billion floating-point
operations per second). This HPC capability is necessarily complemented by high-end desktops,
state-of-the-art visualization capabilities and ultra-fast high-volume networking and file stores
to deliver an integrated environment for state-of-the-art calculations. Although remarkable, this
level of computing does not provide a fully predictive capability; in fact such a capability will
not be possible in the coming two decades even if Moore’s Law continues to hold for that
time. Approximations in the methods therefore continue to be required to enable calculations
to be carried out in a reasonable time, and these approximations must be underpinned by
empirical data.

Non-nuclear physics experiments are required to provide material data for the codes and
separately to provide validation of the codes, and indeed validation of the designers who must
be tested against cutting-edge science in the absence of nuclear tests. The experiments broadly
