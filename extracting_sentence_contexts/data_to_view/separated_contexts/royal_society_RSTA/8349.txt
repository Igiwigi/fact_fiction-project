This appears to be a problem of great complexity,
and certain parts of what follows are distinctly speculative in character. The essence of
the complication is this : that whereas the investigation of §§ 6, 7 or 9 furnishes periodic
solutions in the neighbourhood of &, it certainly does not furnish all the periodic solutions
in this neighbourhood. In fact, it appears that the problem of finding all the periodic
solutions in any neighbourhood of &, however small, may be of the same order of
complication as the similar problem in which we do not thus restrict ourselves to a
specific neighbourhood.
(i) We start by summing up the chief results of the preceding work. THEOREM I.—A fourth order Hamiltonian system

possesses regular periodic solutions if there exists a point (a9, y,°) at which the derivatives
BF /ox,, OF /oy, all vanish, and at which the analytic function F is regular (§ 12); it also
possesses such solutions if F differs sufficiently little from a Hamiltonian function Fy for
which the equations are known to possess a regular periodic solution (§ 13). We do not
enquire further into the necessary conditions that F must satisfy in order that (14.1) may
possess periodic solutions. (For references see the end of § 4 above.)

TuEoreM Il.—/f the system (14.1) possesses a regular periodic solution & (not an
equilibrium solution), it possesses also a continuous singly-infinite family F (of which & is a
member) of such solutions, for which the parameter o and the characteristic ratio R vary
continuously along the family.
