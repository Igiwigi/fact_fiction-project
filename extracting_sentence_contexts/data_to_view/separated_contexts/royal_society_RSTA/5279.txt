With the front mirror 4 inches long, and the centre of semi-transparent mirror
inches back from the 38-inch square formed by the other three mirrors, the most freq
adjustment has been to set the front mirror 1 inch forward. A parallel beam inci
on the centre of semi-transparent mirror, at 45°, must now go three times ro
the frame, rebounding three times from each of the three mirrors, and twice from

* This fact makes the bands more susceptible to some kinds of disturbance, e.g., irregulariti
temperature or density ; more stable fringes can be obtained by using an even number of reflexions; &

s between which the light has to go are, however, only 1 inch apart, so this
