Tf the effect of the obstacle is g’, then

(1) ¢’ is continuous (and ¢ necessarily) on the boundary.

(2) ¢’=0 over the rest of the plane (corresponding to the
conductor), by symmetry.

(3) 0/on (p+¢’) — 0 over the aperture.

If we take y= V, ¢’ = —(V+V’), so that g+¢’=—V’, the jp Fra ($+9)-0
conditions of one problem satisfy those of the other, and the
solutions are identical. We obtain, in fact, the following ;
theorem :— d=0

(A)—If a set of charges giving potential V is on one side of a hole
in an infinite conducting wall, the whole potential being V+-V’,
then an exactly similar set of sources of fluid giving potential V, similarly situated
with regard to an obstacle corresponding to the aperture, give a whole potential —V’.
This result may be reversed, and stated as follows :—

(B)—If a set of sources on one side of a plane obstacle in an infinite liquid gives
velocity potential ¢, and the whole potential is ¢-+¢’, then an exactly similar and
similarly situated set of charges in front of an infinite plane conductor, with a hole
corresponding to the obstacle, giving a potential g, leads to a whole potential —¢’
