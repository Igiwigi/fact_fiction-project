I have $tated, that where the Saxicave are abundant, their
holes very often communicate ; and that their shells are

af acted on when exposed to the foot of another. On exa-
J mining a considerable number, taken indiscriminately from
5 the same rock, I have found that the shells of more than
= half had been thus injured. As long as the injury is super-
E ficial, no attempt is made to repair it ; but when the shell is
J nearly or quite penetrated, the breach becomes filled, not
5 with new shell, but with a firm yellow substance, which is
= insoluble even in a strong mineral acid. It would be difficult
E to conceive a fact short of absolute demonstration, which
- could give a more decisive support to the theory of a solvent.
E A peculiar provision is given to the animal to preserve it
S from destruction by an injury, to which it is particularly
Z exposed. The supposition of mechanical penetration would
= require us to believe that a newly formed substance, much
E softer than that which has been destroyed, can stop the pro-

S application of the original destructive force.

E I have delayed the communication of this paper for many
a months, from a wish to complete the subject by detecting
