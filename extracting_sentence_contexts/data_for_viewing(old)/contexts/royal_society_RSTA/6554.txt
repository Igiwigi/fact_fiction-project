The formula which RecNautt employed in his extensive research on vapour-
pressures was suggested by Brot, It is

log p = a-+ba'+c*.

The concordance between the found and calculated pressures through a range of —
temperatures so great as from —20° to 180° shows how well this formula interprets
the facts. The constants employed were calculated from the observations at 0°, 45°,
90°, 135°, and 180°. The numbers directly read were, however, not taken; but small
portions of the curve about these points were previously smoothed by means of the’
simpler formula

log p = a+ba',
The constants for the larger formula are

a = 5'9834771, log « = 1:99827459,
log b = 0°5240258, log B = 1:99130336 ;
log ¢ = 1:5733238,

b and c are both negative.
