Apparently, as will be shown, the typical line of the series is the
satellite. The strong line is a positive collateral of this and always shows a great
increase of intensity. Although these facts are obvious the connection was not
recognised, until the relation showed itself first in a series of collaterals. It is, I think,
safe to say that a positive displacement produces a tendency to increase of intensity ;
there may be other causes acting so as sometimes to mask the effect, but in general,
where the rule appears to be broken, the suggested displacements should be regarded
with some doubt. In so far as I have used this rule in the following, the results are
biassed and of course the evidence for the rule to that extent weakened.
