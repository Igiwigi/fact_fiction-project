stance of height when the diagram did not actually reach the upper limit. Such
mbers are enclosed in square brackets.
-3 For the purpose of a comparison, which will be referred to later on, the differences
temperature between the sea level at or near Crinan and the top of Ben Nevis
Brive been added.
= In order to complete the comparison of the variations of temperature gradients
Sith the meteorological conditions at the time of observation, reference may be made
the barometric curves for Fort William and Ben Nevis, which are plotted above
fhe diagram from the hourly observations forwarded to the Meteorological Office, and
B the charts of the paths of depressions in the monthly summaries of the “ Weekly
Weather Report” for July and August. The latter are reproduced in fig. 5. The
sition of the sea area at which the series of observations were made is indicated
dy a small circle on the maps. As a matter of fact, the barometric variations were
comparatively inconspicuous during the period of observations, and the weather
presented a succession of nearly calm days of a somewhat uninteresting character.
Barometric observations were also made at Crinan, and they have been utilised in
the comparison, but the variations follow so closely the variations at Fort William for
which a continuous curve is available that it has not been thought necessary to
represent the Crinan observations on the diagram.
The conditions under which the kite ascents were made during the period of the
experiments tended to confine the higher ascents to days upon which the weather
has a particular feature, namely, a moderately strong wind in the upper strata.
