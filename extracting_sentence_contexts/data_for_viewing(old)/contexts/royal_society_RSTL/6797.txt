the following cases :â€”

1. The difference may be due to the decomposition of nitrogenous compounds during
the growth of the Graminaceous plants, and to the evolution of free Nitrogen. b

2. The Leguminous plants may assimilate the free Nitrogen of the air, and thus, not,
only allow the resources of the s0il to accumulate, but also leave within it an additional
quantity, in roots and other vegetable d6bris, from that which has been assimilated, as
above supposed.

3. It may be due to the operation of both these causes.

So far as the facts we have already considered go, the difference in question cannot
be explained according to the first of the above suppositions ; and others, to which we
shall have presently to refer, will be seen to afford confirmatory evidence on the point.

With regard to the second supposed explanation, the results we have now to record
of our experiments with Leguminous plants are not of themselves sufficient to settle
every point which it involves. Reference to the Appendix will shoy that, in several
cases, we failed to get healthy growth with Leguminous plants. A doubt might hence
be raised, as to the value of those experiments in which we were successful under
cireumstances 80 nearly identical with those of our failures that it was not easy to
account for the difference of result obtained. In those cases, however, in which we
have succeeded in getting Leguminous plants to grow pretty healthily for a consider-
