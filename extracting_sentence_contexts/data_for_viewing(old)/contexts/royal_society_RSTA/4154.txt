We now turn back again to exact quantum resonance conditions, more particularly to formula
(3.13) from §3b(i). From the phase term ¢(,7,t) in equation (3.13) it can be seen that, when
quasi-momentum f is non-zero, then the total phase induced by different values of n depends
not only on its magnitude but also on its sign. Experiments to investigate this situation were
performed at Oklahoma with a Bose-Einstein condensate of about 40000 rubidium atoms [36].
The atoms correspond to a distribution of quasi-momenta with a full width at half-maximum
(FWHM) of about 0.05 in our dimensionless units. We must average equation (3.13) over these
initial conditions in 6. The data—guided by our theory—clearly indicate that the asymmetric
dependence of the averaged fidelity on gravity may turn out to be useful in determining
externally applied accelerations and, in turn, the temperature (given by the kinetic energy) of
ultracold atoms in the limit of negligible interatomic interactions. The immediate value of this
experimental application is highlighted by the fact that just four kicks were used in figure 7,
making similar experiments very fast, stable and versatile. While the experimental data from
figure 7 are not yet as stable as one would like for a practically useful thermometer, numerical

Figure 7. Fidelities from formula (3.13) versus 77 for t = 4zr, k = 0.5, taken after four kicks and averaged over a Gaussian
distribution of quasi-momenta with FWHM of about AB = 0.06 (a) and AB = 0.07 (b) centred around 6 = 0.5. The solid
lines are theoretical averages, while the symbols represent experimentally measured data points. Circles and stars represent
