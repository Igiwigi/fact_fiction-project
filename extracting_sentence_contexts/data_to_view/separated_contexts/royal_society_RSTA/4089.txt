Indeed, Mx(t) first increases by feeding from the
decay of Mmp(t) until it reaches a maximum. This growth indicates a progressive divergence
of long-range correlations. Thereafter, Mx(t) should decay, accounting for the fact that the state
remains properly normalized. This is precisely what M;,1(f) measures: a conserved polarization
that ultimately distributes uniformly within the spin system. In an isolated finite system this
implies the asymptotic plateau Moo ~ 1/N.
