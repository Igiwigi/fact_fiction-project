than is the large arteria facialis.” He considers that a penetration of the stapes by
the arteria facialis is highly improbable, since the diameter of that vessel is usually
greater than that of the cartilage. This latter statement I found to be correct for
every embryo I have examined, but the evidence adduced above from my
Embryo 45a, Stage P, while at first it may appear to support, does not really
confirm, the contention of ScHAUINSLAND that this small artery is homologous with
the arteria stapedialis of the Mammalia. I would rather suggest that the function
of this small artery is to ensure the blood supply of the posterior wall of the
tympanic cavity, the thymus gland, and the musculus depressor mandibule, I have
called it, therefore, the arteria hyomandibularis. The arteria stapedialis (arteria
facialis) frequently shows a constriction as it passes the stapes (Stage P,
Embryo 45a), and it is occasionally somewhat sunken in a groove on the anterior
surface of this cartilage (Stage P, Embryo 45a, Q. 51a, and R. 141). These facts

may possibly be adduced as additional evidence in favour of the generally accepted
homology between the arteria stapedialis (arteria facialis) of the Reptilia and the
arteria stapedialis of the Mammalia.

The presence of an artery piercing the stapes in many Mammalian embryos was
demonstrated by SALEensKy (1880), and although the vessel usually atrophies in
Man, it persists in many other Mammals. Goopricu (1915) records the chondrification
