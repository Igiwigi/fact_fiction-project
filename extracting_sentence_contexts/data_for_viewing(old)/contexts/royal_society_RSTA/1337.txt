criteria depends on the interconnected system physical parameters (e.g. transmission capacities,

such criteria are defined in a non-harmonized manner.


resistances and reactances, import/export stability, etc.) which are again the synthesis of all intra-
area physical parameters. Therefore, any single TSO may create a negative value to the group due
to its respective part of the system security limitations and due to the physical parameters of its
control area.

To introduce the positive contribution, beyond the basic fact that electricity flows through the
TSO operated infrastructure, we underline the sharing of grid flexibility. The ability to re-route
power flows with grid flexibility resources can be used to achieve operational cost savings and
operational reliability [16,27]. Co-optimizing such resources along with the resources offered by
the market actors enlarges the space of actions that can be used to achieve the multi-area system
security [24]. It follows that any single TSO enlarging the space of actions that can be used to
achieve the multi-area system security may create a positive value to the group.

On this basis, we argue for sharing the costs incurred for securing the physical execution of :3
the electricity market transactions in a way that reflects the net contribution of each TSO in the =
multi-area power system. To do so, we propose to evaluate the contributions of each single TSO : ”
to the multi-area system security management by means of counterfactual analysis, as per the a
detailed methodology developed in §3. Furthermore, to allocate payments and revenues as per a
