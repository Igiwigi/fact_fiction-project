The linear perturbation analysis accounting for prestretch in the
substrate [15] slightly underestimates the critical wavelength. The computational model predicts
the correct relation between wavelength and thickness, but we observe a slight offset on the axis
of the ordinate. This can be attributed to the fact that we are limited to a finite size of elements. Thus, the computational approach presented here cannot capture the behaviour towards the zero-
thickness limit [37]. In addition to the experimental results in the model problem of an elastomeric bilayer, we plot
the wavelength versus the thickness of all dehydrated fruits shown in figure 1.
