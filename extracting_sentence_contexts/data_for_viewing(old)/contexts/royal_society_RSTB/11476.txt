SAside from the ubiquity of highly abstract content words, languages
are replete with highly abstract function words such as the, it and to.
“We do not wish to diminish the likely importance of other cognitive
structures, such as affective and emotional representations [17,33,34],
and metaphorical connections between abstract concepts and
concrete ones [46,47].

SAlthough the concreteness-by-iconicity interaction was significant,
more iconic ‘concrete’ words were not classified by participants as
concrete at greater rates than less iconic ‘concrete’ words. Further
investigation is necessary to determine if the iconicity effect we
observed here is, in fact, limited to abstract words. In addition, it
has to be noted that we are using the accuracy summary data from
Pexman et al. [135] and analyse it using linear models, which has
been argued to lead to anti-conservative estimates [136].
