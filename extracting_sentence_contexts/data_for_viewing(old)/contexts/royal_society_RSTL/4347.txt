one with carbonate of soda, the other with dilate sulphuric acid. Each measure of
either test was made equivalent to {5th of a grain of dry and pure carbonate of s8oda.

A bottle containing 1000 grains at least of urine was filled and weighed. The urine
was heated in a cup to 120?, and then the test solution was dropped in from a gra-
duated tube; so that the urine, when acid, was made, by alkali, just neutral to the
most delicate test-paper ; and when alkaline, it was made just neutral by acid. The
number of measures required gave the degree of acidity or alkalescence of the urine.

In the second part of this paper, it will be seen from experiments made four months
previously to these, that the same Kind of yariations took place then ; and in the same
case two years before, and again even three years previous to these experiments, the
same fact was noted.

Thus, October 13, 1846, breakfast on bread and meat at 9 a.m.

Urine passed at 1 p.m., clear. Specific gravity . . 10228. Alkaline.
Urine passed at 3 p.m., clear. Specific gravity . . 10199. Acid.

And October 28, 1845, breakfast at 9Þ 15m,

Urine passed at 10 - A.M. Acid.
Urine passed at 12 30 p.m. Alkaline.
Urine passed at 3 Acid.
