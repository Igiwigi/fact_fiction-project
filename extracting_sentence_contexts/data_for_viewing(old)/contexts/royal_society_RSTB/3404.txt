The diseases are malaria, meningitis, tetanus, bronchitis and pneumonia, etc.,
enteritis, and congenital debility ; in all of which, with the exception of meningitis,
there is an excess of M. deaths, the totals showing M. 1566, F. 1341. Enteritis is
the most deadly (M. 589, F. 523), meningitis the least (M. 108, F. 119).

This result shows conclusively that the excess of F. deaths among coloured people
is not due to excessive weakness of coloured F. children up to 5 years of age.

In the introduction to the Report, attention is drawn to the fact that 36째19 per cent.
of all deaths between the ages of 15 and 60 years was caused by pulmonary tuber-
culosis, and from the following details it will be seen (on the supposition that one-third
of the population is coloured) that the coloured race suffers far more in proportion to
population than the whites, and the coloured F. more than the M. from this disease.

For whites (above 5 years) there are M. 1101, F. 1061, total 2162 deaths from
pulmonary tuberculosis ; for coloured, M. 531, F. 838, total 1369 deaths from that
disease.

The excess of F. over M. deaths among colowred people from this disease alone
during the year 1905 amounts to 307 ; when to these figures is added deaths from
various forms of cancer, malignant tumours, and puerperal disease (M. 44, F. 282),
