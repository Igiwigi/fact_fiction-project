an equation connecting the indefinitely 8mall values of w, v, with the indefinitely
large values of a, y.

147, From the equations A=ky,ova, B=k;w1/b, taking (, v) indefinitely small and
therefore (z, y) indefinitely large, we deduce

and hence substituting for = the foregoing value, and introducing an indeterminate
multiplier M, we obtain

ex u+cv=Mk, {mu +pr+4S(onbr) +la(ou+ro)},
which breaks up into the two equations

which twelve equations determine the coefficients w, o, p, 7 in terms of the c', c” of the
odd functions 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14 ; and moreover give rise to relations connecting these

and then operating with d on the equations A=wok,/ab, &c., we have for instance

AdB—BdA=o%yk;\ (wu +pr)(/adiv/b—1/Dd;i/a)
+(ou'+7v)(1/adz/b—=1/Ddgr/a)},

which is one of a system of 120 equations, the A, B being in fact any two of the 16
functions. These are in fact nothing else than the foregoing system of 120 equations giving the
values of the differential combinations 9,09; — 9,d3,, &c., each as a gum of products of
pairs of functions, only on the right-hand sides we haye expressions snch as
1/adix/b—1/bd,x/a, &e., which present themselves as perfectly determinate functions
of &, y/ : 80 that regarding wu'+pv', ou'+7v' as given linear functions of the arbitrary
quantities u/, v, there is no longer anything indeterminate in the form of the equations,
