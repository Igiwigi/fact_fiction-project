It should be mentioned that no part of the Rugby wire was disconnected in these
experiments, but that the whole length of wire was in action, and therefore exposed
to the same influences from atmospheric currents, induction, or thermo-electric
action, There was no alteration whatever made in the wire excepting the change of
position of one of its earth connections ; and consequently the reversing of the direc-
tion of the current in the wire, as compared with that of the Willington wire, cannot
be attributed to any other cause. The question naturally presents itself, from whence do these currents arise 7

On this subject an important fact was ascertained during the large deflections
which occurred in September and October, namely, that spontaneous deflections of

precisely the same character as those described in the foregoing part of this paper,
were found to take place on the short telegraph from the Electric Telegraph office in
the Strand to the Nine Elms Station, the wires of which are laid underground in
tubes throughout their length. Taking this fact in connection with those before mentioned, viz. that no deflection
is produced in a wire suspended throughout its length in the air, that no deflection
is produced with a wire having only one earth connection, but that in every case
deflections are exhibited in a wire having two earth connections, and that the direc-
tion of the current in the wire at any given time is dependent on the relative positions
of the earth connections, the most probable explanation appears to be that the cur-
rents are terrestrial, of which a portion is conveyed along the wire, and rendered
visible by the multiplying action of the coil of the galyanometer. POSTSCRIPT.

My DEAR SiK, Derby, May 8, 1848. It has often occurred to me, that if the deflections were caused by atmospheric
electricity, they should occur before and during storms.
