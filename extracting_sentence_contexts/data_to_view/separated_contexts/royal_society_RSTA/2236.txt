With any departure from the specified conditions of low pressure and excitation by
uncondensed electric discharge the law breaks down, and the lines broaden in an
apparently anomalous manner. The characteristics which lead RypBEre to adopt
the terms diffuse and sharp series appear, the higher members of a series undergoing
the greater degree of broadening. Matters are complicated by the fact that the
broadening is in many cases unsymmetrical, and in addition we must take into
account the fact pointed out by Royps,* that different members of the same series
may be unsymmetrically broadened in opposite directions. Thus in the case of the
first subordinate “triplet” series of barium, the members consisting of triplet and
satellites at \A 5819-5424 are all unsymmetrically broadened towards the red, whilst
the members of the succeeding triplet (and satellites) and \\ 4493-4264 are unsym-
metrically broadened towards the violet. Royps shows that similar phenomena occur
in the spectra of calcium and strontium, and points out the importance of the
phenomena in relation to the pressure shifts of the lines in question.
