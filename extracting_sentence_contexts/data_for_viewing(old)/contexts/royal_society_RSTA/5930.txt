and statistical isotropy and homogeneity.

Remark 2.6 (Stochastic setting). Rigorously establishing alignment properties such as those
appearing in hypothesis 2.3 seems to be a very difficult task. Moreover, even if true generically, it is
quite conceivable that it is false pathwise the setting of the deterministic Navier-Stokes solutions
due to non-generic events. Thus, such properties might be easier established in the stochastically
forced or random data setting. For instance, one might be able to prove the existence of statistically
stationary, homogenous isotropic martingale solutions. It is then plausible that (2.10) and (2.11)
hold for such solutions upon ensemble averaging. See [44] for some interesting developments
concerning the validity of hypothesis 2.1.


The fact that inertial dissipation and the direct energy cascade can provide a regularization
mechanism for the weak solutions is well understood in some model problems, such as
one-dimensional conservation laws [48-50] as well the dyadic (Desnyansky-Novikov) shell
model of turbulence [51]. For three-dimensional Navier-Stokes, no form of uniform fractional
regularity or self-regularization has ever been rigorously established from first principles,
however experiments and simulations ubiquitously indicate that solutions do possess some form
of these phenomena [36-40]. In particular, as discussed above, measurements of multifractal
structure function scaling exponents from over the last 60 years indicate that some turbulent
solutions of Navier-Stokes enjoy some limited uniform fractional regularity in L? spaces. Under
the hypotheses 2.1 and 2.3, the latter being of a quantitative nature, we capture some of the
smoothing effect of the nonlinearity and obtain a self-regularizing property of dissipative weak
Euler solutions by theorem 1.2. Thus, the 4/5-law together some alignment properties implies
regularization for any such weak Euler solution with a finite positive inertial dissipation (in
