These contours are
presented on a map with axes of N and AH: in line with the predictions in figure 5, we observe
that Dihtag increases with decreasing AH (deeper traps), increasing trap density N and decreasing
hydrogen concentration op. Moreover, the contours of Dihtag suggest that there is a regime where
hag is independent of AH and another where hag increases linearly with N. In fact, the asymptotic
analysis indicates that both the maps in figure 7 span regimes I and II with the boundary between
the two regimes given by a transition value of the binding energy

in EP tests on a quenched and tempered martensitic steel Fe—0.45C—1.5Mo. The measurements are shown (by markers) for
selected input currents parametrized here by 6} along with numerical predictions employing (a) N = 1.7 x 10~ “and AH=
