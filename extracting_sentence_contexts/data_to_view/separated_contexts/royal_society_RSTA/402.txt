By August 2012, there were over one million applicants for the 20
000 registered plates [39]. Similar approaches have been adopted elsewhere; Shanghai began
auctioning new licence plates in 1998 and these now command as much as Â¥60 000, which is more
than the national average annual income [39]. But the simple fact is that road building cannot
keep pace with demand for car ownership. The Chinese car industry is concerned by these constraints. It has grown massively and
is keen to satisfy burgeoning domestic demand with affordable but basic cars, while cars
manufactured locally by overseas manufacturers also generally have lower specifications than
their OECD counterparts.
