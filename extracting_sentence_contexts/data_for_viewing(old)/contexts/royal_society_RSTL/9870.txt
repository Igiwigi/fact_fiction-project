Y The method pursued is to assume a series of equidistant values of £, and then to

gompute all the functions (251-4), snbstitute them in (250), and combine the equi-
istant, values of the functions to be integrated by the rules of the calculus of finite
ifferences.

The preceding integration terminates where the day is 9 hrs. 55 m., and the moon's
Sidereal period is 8:17 m.s. days. If the present tropical year be the unit of time, we
have, at the beginning of the present integration log ng=3'7 4451, log Nz=2:44836,
and log k+10=6:20990, being 8N, of (7).

The first step is to compute a series of values of 1/1, by means of (254). Asa fact,
I had already computed n/ng corresponding to E=1, *92, '84, *76 for the paper on
© Precession,” by means of a formula, which took account of the obliquity of the ecliptic ;
And accordingly I computed n/ng, by the same formula, for the values of E=96, *88, 80,
Instead of doing the whole operation by means of (254). The difference between my
Tezults here used and those from (254) would be very small.
