every prime of § in points, and the point of = corresponding to the E-curve must
therefore be an n-ple base point of ‘Y ; a doubly infinite family of such K-curves will
in general be transformed, then, to an n-ple base surface of ¥. Conversely also it can be
shown that to the neighbourhood of a point of a base surface of ‘f there corresponds in
general an E-curve of 8,} and that as the point varies on the surface the E-curve describes

* The method employed here is a generalisation of that employed by Cremona to obtain the Cremona
transformations of space of three dimensions. See Cremona, ‘ Rendiconti Lombardo ’ (2), vol. 4, pp. 269,
315 (1871) ; ‘Annali di Mat.’ (2), vol. 5, p. 131 (1871); ‘Opere matematiche,’ vol. 3, pp. 241, 251, 298 (1917).
Compare also the accounts in Sturm, * Geometrische Verwandschaften,’ p. 347 (1909), and Hupson,
‘Cremona Transformations,’ p. 167 (1927).

+ In fact the tangent cone to a ‘Y-primal at a point P of an n-ple base surface F will in general break up
into n primes through the tangent plane x at P; so that all points near P, which lie in a prime through
zt, impose the same condition on ‘Y-primals to contain them, and will be represented by the same point
P’ of S. This point P’, then, describes the E-curve of S which corresponds to the neighbourhood of P. Cf.
