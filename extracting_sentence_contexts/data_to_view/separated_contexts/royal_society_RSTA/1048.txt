It was not
until February 1931, that the rate again became normal and approximately steady,
the sextant reading now being about 6Â° lower than its value in November 1930. We
fear that this phenomenon may be due to slight slipping at the soldered joints between
the quartz fibre and the lever, or between the quartz fibre and the end points to which
it is attached. In support of this we have the following facts. In July and August
1927, observations were made for a period of about 3 weeks during which time the lever
was unclamped. On resuming the clamping at the end of the period and continuing
daily observation, no change in the daily rate took place.
