â€”Hemipinic acid is decomposed, when
boiled with concentrated hydriodie acid, into carbonic acid, iodide of methyl (boiling-
point 42*8 C., vapour-density 5:05; calculated yapour-density 4:92), and an acid of the
formula C, H, O,. Tt will be seen that the composition of this acid is intermediate
between that of salicylic acid, C, H, O,, and that of gallic acid, C, Hy O;, and, as will be
seen by the description which follows, it is analogous to these acids in some of its pro-
perties. Accordingly, in order to recall the fact of its containing one atom of oxygen
less than gallic acid, we propose to name it provisionally hypogallic acid, reserving to
ourselves to suggest, if posstble, a more appropriate name when its chemical relations shall
have been more thoroughly investigated. The reaction, by which these products are
formed, takes place according to the equation
