But their undoubted coherence into mulberry-like masses is
striking (fig. 7, c), and if it be urged that the proteids of milk in solution (fresh), o
precipitated (albumen in boiled milk), may have their share in effecting this union,
still the facts seem to demand the existence of some homogeneous unifying substance,
its outline joining the peripheral fatty globules, while those that are more internal
lie embedded in it. It is natural to try to test the validity of such an inference by
reference to the fate of ingested proteid and Indian ink. I am anxious, however,
before entering upon any discussion of the meaning of aggregation, to increase the
list of facts upon which such discussion may be based, and I turn to record the results
of some observations of a second main modification of the phenomenon. }

Case 2.â€”The movement is double; two processes, or, more probably, two steps in one
process, muy be distinguished, unlike in duration, and, to a certain extent, in result. The composite mass is made up of a central portion, shaped by the first rapid
gathering, and a cap-like or spherical border of solid substance deposited later
(fig. 8, 1d, 2c). In one series of experiments this double movement constantly
followed the ingestion of the white of stale eggs coagulated after dilution.
