A further argument against the sug-
gestion that these grits are of Triassic, or even Cretaceous, age is found in the fact that
they are composed entirely of material derived from the Basement Complex. If the
grits were formed before the fracture that gave rise to the Uganda escarpment, where
are the deposits which must have accumulated as the result of erosion of that escarp-
ment? There is in fact only one sedimentary series, the Turkana Grits, and I am
therefore forced to the conclusion that they are the product of erosion acting on the
Uganda escarpment. Further, it is unlikely that the escarpment itself is of such an
early age, for it would hardly have remained so clear cut for such a great length of
time. It has usually been thought that the Central African Peneplain was first dis-
turbed in late Cretaceous times, but that rifting proper did not begin until the late
Oligocene (Gregory 1921, p. 204; Wayland 1929).
