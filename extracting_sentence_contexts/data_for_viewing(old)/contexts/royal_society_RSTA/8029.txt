stretching force is removed. For instance, in one series of experiments, a Cotswold
wool fibre that at first snapped back almost instantaneously when released in water
immediately after an extension, took 1600 minutes to recover in water at room tem-
perature from an extension of 50:7, to one of 5-7%, after it had been held stretched
in water at the higher extension for 214 days. This behaviour, in view of what has been
said above about the loosening action of water on the strained side-chains, seems
paradoxical, but a little consideration shows that it is not really so, if we postulate
that the breakdown of the strained side-chain linkages is followed automatically by
the formation of new linkages. It is then easy to understand why the process of
elastic recovery is impeded by the changes which take place during the decay of tension.
That this explanation is the correct one is shown very strikingly by simply re-stretching
the “relaxed ’’} fibre. It is found then that it once more recovers its original length
quickly when the stretching force is removed, and, in fact, recovers more and more
rapidly as the re-stretching process is repeated. Both recovery in water and re-
stretching, therefore, have the effect of reversing or destroying the new-formed side-
linkages, with the final result that the fibre is left permanently easier to stretch, but
with its speed of elastic recovery more or less unimpaired. Fig. 6 and Table II show

* There is just a suggestion that the prolonged action of water on keratin results in some hydrolysis of
the main-chains (Asrpury and Woops, ‘ Nature,’ vol. 127, p. 663 (1931) ), but this point requires further
investigation and will be reported on later.
