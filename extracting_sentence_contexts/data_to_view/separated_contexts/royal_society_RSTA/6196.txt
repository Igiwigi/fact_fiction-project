Namely, they proved that RCAg + ADS is sufficient to prove the equivalence between
I7}-(A and uniform Kruskal theorem (ADS is the principle asserting that any infinite linear order
either contains an infinite ascending chain or an infinite descending chain). And at the same time,
they establish that over RCAg the uniform Kruskal theorem does not imply TT} -(Ag. The proof of the fact that uniform Kruskal theorem implies IT} -CAg is quite involved and
indirect: it relies on a result of Freund that JT}-CAy is implied by Bachmann-Howard well-ordering
principle, which in turn had been obtained by a rather advanced proof-theoretic techniques. Question 3.4. Is there a simple direct proof of m1} -CAp in RCAg + ADS+ uniform Kruskal theorem?
