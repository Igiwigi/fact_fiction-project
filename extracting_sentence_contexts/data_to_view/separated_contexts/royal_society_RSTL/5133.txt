tudes, where the north end of the needle attains its extreme easterly and westerly
positions at the same hours in all seasons, at St. Helena the curve of diurnal
movement is precisely reversed at opposite periods of the year; in general terms, it
may be said to correspond to that of the diurnal variation in the northern hemisphere,
(at Toronto for example), when the sun is north of the equator, and to the diurnal
variation in the southern hemisphere (or as at Hobarton), when the sun is south of
the equator. It appeared therefore desirable to examine whether the law of the
occurrence of the disturbance, as respects the hour of the day, remained the same in
every month in the year, whether in fact there was any analogy between the law of
bourly disturbance at one period of the year compared with northern latitudes, or at
Toronto, and of the opposite period compared with southern latitudes, or at Hobarton. Table X. will show that the law is the same in all the months of the year, the
hours of the day being in every month periods of greatest, and the night hours of
least disturbance, |
