Fig. 6,—Section in part ideal of ancient and modern lavas in the Cava Grande near the head of the ravine.

a, c. Laya of 1689, with lofty, parallel, east and west ridges.
c, d. Branch of same current descending the right bank of the Cava Grande, and inclined at 35® and higher
angles, the dark central portion being compact, the rest scoriaceous.

The annexed section (fig. 6) is supposed to pass through the Cava Grande in a north
and south direction, or at right angles to its course, and to intersect not only the newer
lava of 1689 (a, c, 4), but also the nine or ten older currents of Etna (e, * and &, F)
which constituted the walls of a ravine before the modern lava poured into it. The old
currents alluded to appear horizontal in the diagram, because they are intersected at
right angles to their dip. They are in fact inclined at about 7% eastward or towards the
sea, each laya being on an average about 10 or 12 feet thick, and separated by frag-
mentary matter belonging to the top and bottom scoriz of snccessive currents, or 80me-
times by tuff, 7. e. volcanic sand and mud transported by land-floods or the winds. These
partings are about equal in thickness to the solid beds, and exhibit at various heights
red or burnt strata, as at F, three of them being conspicuous on the left bank.

To return to the branch of the lava of 1689, or c, d, fig. 6: T have stated that its
central portion is quite compact. Tt contains crystals of felspar, but none of augite, a
small quantity of olivine, no iron, and its specific gravity is that of an ordinary trap-rock.
It is worthy of notice, that this central inclined layer surpasses greatly in compactness @
