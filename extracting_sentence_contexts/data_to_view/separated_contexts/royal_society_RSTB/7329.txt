My imagination can only bridge the gap between any of these Ginkgoales and Lepto-
strobus by going right back to a Psilophytalean type of organization of telomes and phyllomes. This is another way of saying they seem unrelated. Leptostrobus (with Czekanowskia) has in fact the same sort of relation to the Ginkgoales as
Taxus has to the conifers. Taxus and its immediate allies agree perfectly with the conifers
in their vegetative organs, but the organization of the female organs is so different as to
make any relationship too obscure to be profitable to follow at the present time. Leptostrobus requires a new major group to accommodate it, but for reasons given below
this group is not yet proposed.

(1) It seems very likely that a fresh study of really good material, such as that originally
described by Heer, would greatly enrich and perhaps materially alter any characterization
at present possible.
