We add decoherence into our system model by introducing fluctuations into the system
Hamiltonian H(t) in equation (4.6). The resulting density matrix equation then takes the form
6=-iA) +AOk +hOSz +fa2kSz, pl, (4.7)

where f1(t), fa(t) and f3(t) are assumed to be uncorrelated fluctuations such that E[fi(t + t)f()] =
6,8(t)k;. This captures the fact that various terms contributing to the Hamiltonian fluctuate. This
leads to the master equation

Now, by choosing the frequency of the radiofrequency field w = a, where « is the resonance
frequency of spin I, and transforming into a rotating frame described by taking the density matrix
