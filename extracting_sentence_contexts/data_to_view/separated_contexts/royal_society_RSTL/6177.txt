respectively. The demonstration of this fundamental theorem is for greater complete-
ness here reproduced; but the chief object of the memoir is to direct attention to a
curious analytical theorem which is an easy @ priori consequence of the Porism. and to
obtain the relations for the several polygons up to the enneagon, in a new and simple
form which puts in evidence &% posteriori for these cases the analytical theorem just
referred to. The analytical theorem rests upon the following considerations :;—the
relation for a hexagon ought to include that for a triangle; in fact a triangle with its
