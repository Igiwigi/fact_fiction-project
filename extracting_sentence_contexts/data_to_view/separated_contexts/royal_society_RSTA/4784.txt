First consider arrangements limited in the manner (J; m; n) = (2; 1; «). We have such a graph as

obtained by writing a column of nodes, and over it another column of nodes, not
exceeding the former in number. We may take, as the generating function,

ee en eee
(1 — ax) (1 — w/a)’

in which we are only concerned with that portion of the expansion which is integral
as regards a. ‘The function is, in fact, redundant since it involves terms which are
superfluous, and we obtain the reduced or condensed generating function by putting
a equal to unity in the portion we retain. Since
