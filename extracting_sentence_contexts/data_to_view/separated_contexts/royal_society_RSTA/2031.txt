The behaviour of this function is depicted in figure 16. In addition to the representation (A 39),
the inverse transform of (A38) can be expressed through the Mittag—Leffler function [33] as
follows:

galt)=e “'(t) PE, 1_p(A), (A 40)

where Ey,g(z) is a Mittag-Leffler function defined by the series Ey,g(z) = P29 2*/I'(ak + 6). Owing to the fact that equation (A 37) has a unique solution, expressions (A 39) and (A 40)
define the same unique function. So, equating expressions on the right-hand side of equalities
(A39) and (A40) leads to the following presentation of the Mittag—Leffler function for a =1:
Ey, p(2)=1/1(B) +2) Fe[1 — F(B,2)/F(B)1-


Function g(t) and similar functions are commonly referred to as memory functions [13]
Memory functions can be also associated with one more function y(t) as follows:

Vplt)=A Poa) —1. (A41)
Accounting for (A 39) gives

e “(at rd -B,Ab)
r(l—s) (1-8)

From the formula (A 42), it can be seen that function y(t) depends on a variable T = At. So,
further, if there is no need to search for the limit as A > 0, we can write

va(t) (A 42)

e T(r? —ra—8,T)

The introduced functions have the following properties:
