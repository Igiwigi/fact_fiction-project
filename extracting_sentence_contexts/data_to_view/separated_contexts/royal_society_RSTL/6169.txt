Their prevailing shape is an oval, more or less pointed at
one end, and equally convex on both sides. They vary in length from 2 to 8 inches, but
are usnally from 4 to 6 inches long. There is also considerable variety in their form,
probably owing to defects in the flints from which they were fashioned ; and in fact the
two classes into which, for convenience sake, I have divided these rudely-formed instru-
ments, as distinct from the flint flakes, may be said to run one into the other; it being
hard to determine to which of them some of the weapons are to be referred. Such of
the Celtic implements as have a cutting edge all round, are more triangular in their form
and are of yery rare occurrence; those of the oyal-shape, on the contrary, appear to be
equally common in the drift with those of the spear head character, the oval form pre-
dominating near Abbeville, and the spear heads being most abundant at St. Acheul.
