Note that in the models of cellular automata in [3], the interaction with the environment
can produce changes, i.e. perturbations, in the evolution rule of system A. So it differs from
algorithmic perturbations because the latter impact the states of system A instead of its evolution
tule. In fact, one can reduce each state-dependent rule perturbation of a cellular automaton A
in [3] to an equivalent algorithmic perturbation on an equivalent universal cellular automaton
that emulates A. To this end, just note that every finite cellular automaton is computable by
a Turing machine and there are universal cellular automata (for example, elementary cellular
automaton Rule 110) that can simulate any Turing machine [1]. Thus, for each state-dependent


tule perturbation in [3], one can construct such an equivalent algorithmic perturbation and
then demonstrate that there is a constant ce for which ODE (as in [1], Definition 4.1) implies
unbounded evolution and innovation (see [1], Section 4.1.1).
