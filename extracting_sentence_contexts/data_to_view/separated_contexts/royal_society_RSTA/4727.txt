Then the contraction of the saddle-point condition
with said inverse leads to

ekMY y [28 = mC*Bes (3.10)


Consequently, the fully antisymmetric part y,,, ee vanishes for m =0, and generally does not for
m #0. (In the language chosen in [20] there was already an antisymmetric part for m= 0.)
We can again define a covariant derivative
Vulf = 987 + Yulj (3.11)

where we have adopted meta-indices (capital letters) in the spirit of equation (2.18); and from
there a Riemann tensor,

RR = [Vu Vol (3.12)
The Riemann tensor and the field-strength tensor are related by
CF. =f BEB RK uy, (3.13)

where f@¢f4 — 054. Therefore, the BF term becomes

ig . i cab by pK d 1 ab bIpK ®
qo BL Ey =70 abe BoB IR Juve BE, = 59 abe pa Bi TR vB”, (3.14)

where we have introduced the dual
Bev — 5 Be, (3.15)
in the last step. The similarity to the EF term in the three-dimensional case becomes more apparent

by rewriting the latter as

FEE, = GO EM BERS aye PES = se EM ELR ys E, (3.16)

where

~ i
BO = Sel REN, (3.17)

In fact, this result can be expressed in the form of (3.14) for any dimension. In three dimensions it
turned out to have the most straightforward interpretation. With the definition
Bi Bey = ByBk = 8)K (3.18)
for the metric, the BB term becomes
e e e
-| Biv Bh =- m7 ByBy =- v1 SI (3.19)

and is background-dependent as before.
