water. The resulting solution is saturated with picric acid, and HorMaxw's blue is
added, until the liquid is of a dark blue-green colour. It is then filtered.

T used the method with Chlor. Zine. Iod. almost entirely in my researches upon
the structure of endosperm cells. TI did not discover the picric-HorMaxx's-blue
modification until I had finished my work with pulvini Thus, the results with
pulvini rest mainly on the sulphuric acid modification.

On the nature of the pit membrane.

Tfa thin section of almost any tissue he treated with Chlor. Zinc Tod. it will be seen
that the walls of almost every cell are distinetly pitted.* These pits are brought
into prominence from the fact that whereas the thicker unpitted portions of the cell
wall give a well-defined cellulose blue reaction, the thin pit-closing membranes stain but
8lightly, or in some cases apparently remain quite colourless, Indeed, 80 common is
this pitting, which the above-mentioned reaction demonstrates, that it would be a
statement little short of the truth to 8ay that every cell whatsoever, is pitted to a
greater or less degree. Moreover, the closing membrane of the pit itself may also be
pitted, as in the 8eed of Lnpinus hirsutus, &. As a rule, it is only in the case of thin
walled cells that it is necessary to apply any reagent to bring this pitting into view, for
the more the cell wall increases in thickness the more pronounced does the pitting
become, until its appearance is at length 80 marked that we are accustomed to speak
of ib as a pitted cell par excellence. It is a point of special interest to note that

* Cells of Strychnos, Dioscorea, and Tamus are notable exceptions,
