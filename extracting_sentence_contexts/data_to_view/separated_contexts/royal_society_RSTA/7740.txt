Accordingly we
express the root-mean-square value of the departure of a single observed value from

the mean value of a number of observations over a rectangle of sides 2x, 2y, as
follows :—

Root-mean-square error of representation = E, = 8-02 (x! + y!), (29.3)
or, since in the region concerned the mean value of one degree is 66 miles

Root-mean-square error of representation = E, = 0-7 (a! + 8?)
= 0-55 (A! + Bt), (29.4)

in which «, @ are the lengths in miles of the sides of the rectangle over which the
error is taken and A, B are same lengths in kilometres. It follows that

Probable error of representation in milligals = 0-6745 E, = P,
= 0-47 (a! + p#)
= 0697(AS Bi eo (2005)

These equations have been derived from areas of 2° square and greater and we shall
have need to estimate errors of much smaller areas. According to (29.4), (29.5),
the error would vanish when « and are reduced to zero ; but in fact we must find
that an observed value still had an error of representation of the very point at which
it was observed, namely, the error of observation, é. Obviously, so long as this is
small compared with the errors which we have just considered, we can modify our
empirical formule as follows. Thus

Root-mean-square error of representation = E, = [¢0? + {0-7 (a + p#)}2]# (29.6)

Probable error of representation = P, = [<,2 + {0-47 fat 6F)3e]F 2.2 (29:7)
Thus if ¢ = 3 mg (or the probable error =, = 2 mg), in a 2 degree square for which
we have found a root-mean-square error of 15-6 mg, we have (15-6)? seo IG).
which is as close to 15-6 as our empirical formula is at all likely to be precise.
