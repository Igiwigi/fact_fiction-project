Still, since most models of infec-
tious disease dynamics focus on timescales ranging from
10 to 100 years (as reviewed in [55,56], among many others),
these results clearly show that exclusion of evolutionary
impacts may compromise the ability of these models to make
accurate predictions. It should be noted that, while we have shown significant
evidence of rapid evolutionary response to novel temperature
environments in a disease vector, these studies do not imply
that these changes are adaptive. We have no evidence at this
point that the average population fitness in the novel environ-
ments is, in fact, improved by the altered allelic representation. But true adaptation is actually ancillary to the main concern
of our work. Even if it should be shown later that the trait
differences provide no benefits to surviving novel environ-
mental conditions, it is clear that the novel environments
themselves were the driving pressure for at least some of the
population’s evolution.
