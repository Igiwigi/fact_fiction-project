Although we are interested in small values of the forcing parameter F, we show in figure 7c,d
an expansion of figure 7b. This gives us a better understanding of the amplitude basins, by
showing them for higher values of the forcing F and for a more complete range of frequencies 2. In fact in figure 7c the value of the forcing F goes from 0 to 1 and 2 goes from 0 to z. In figure 7d,
the value of the forcing F goes from 0 to 10 and 2 goes from 0 to 27. In all the figures, it is possible
to appreciate that the effect of the forcing is either none or it suddenly makes the amplitude jump
into a sustained oscillation between the two wells of the potential.
