Of the following milk teeth the second is still sub-triangular with a protoloph that
slopes backwards to a considerable degree. The two remaining teeth are molariform.
The cingulum is moderately developed on the outer side of the second, but barely
perceptible on the third and fourth teeth. On the inner side it is present and complete
in the second, and confined to the front and anterior portions of the third and fourth.
The general pattern of these teeth is sufficiently shown by the figures, Plate 64.

A second specimen of a milk dentition of the same species may be mentioned. This
is a much younger animal with the first milk tooth only just erupting, the second and
third erupted but quite unworn, and the fourth coming up out of its socket. This
specimen agrees closely with the one described above, but its perfect and unworn
condition shows certain further details, such as the fact that the proto- and meta-lophs
join the ectolophs low down and do not reach the top of the external crest as they do
in the permanent teeth, fig. 23, Plate 64.

These two specimens show accurately the order of eruption of the teeth, which
takes place as follows :â€”

The second and third milk teeth are the first to appear and are followed by the
fourth, which erupts a little ahead of the first. By the time that all four milk teeth
are in wear, the second and third being more worn than the first and fourth, the first
molar appears, followed in due course by the other molars. From another specimen
(Forster-Coorer, 1924, fig. 13) it is clear that the fourth premolar is the first of that
series to erupt, followed by the third.
