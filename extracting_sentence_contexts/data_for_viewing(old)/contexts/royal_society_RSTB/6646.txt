In addition to these two bodies which appear to be constantly present, there is a
nodule connected with the apex of the most anterior cusp on the medial cingulum
which is indistinguishable from one of the epithelial bodies in their early stage of
development (fig. 95, Plate 48). There are also two similar small epithelial nodules
connected with the apex of the most posterior cusp of the medial cingulum. These
extra nodules lie rather nearer to the cusp than to the external enamel epithelium and
are connected in each case to the cusp by a strand of cells. They are exactly comparable
with the early developmental appearance of epithelial bodies described in H.J. and
Sled

The lower tooth “‘z”. At this stage “‘z” has not started to calcify. It has a large
antero-lateral cusp, a smaller postero-lateral one, and a rounded cusp on the medial
margin of the tooth. It is therefore of tritubercular nature at this stage. The fact that
there are two prominent cusps developing on the lateral side of the crown indicates
that this tooth is developing the same essential cusp pattern as the preceding cheek
teeth.

Vascularization of the enamel organ has commenced and the vessels are directed in
towards the apical region of the antero-lateral cusp.

In association with the antero-lateral cusp is a large epithelial body (fig. 90, Plate 47)
which lies just deep to the external enamel epithelium and is connected to the apex
of the cusp by a condensed strand of cells. This nodule, ‘‘dz”’, is of the typical cornified
cell type.
