Figure 2 depicts the subthreshold slopes of 64mV/Dec and
70mV/Dec for the p-type and n-type parts of the characteristic, respectively, hence competing
with the most advanced FinFET technologies [3]. In addition, the one-dimensional electrostatic
control over the channel coupled to the use of a Schottky barrier-based injection mechanism
enables very low off-current densities of a few pA per jm when compared with few tens of pA
per j.m for low-power FinFETs [3]. These combined facts qualify the presented device technology
as high-performance low-standby-power technology.

(b) Logic operations with double-gate field effect transistors

Digital circuits using these transistors can exploit both gates as inputs, thereby enabling the design of
compact cells that implement XOR more efficiently than in CMOS. Indeed, in the context of digital
operations, DG-SiNWFETs realize intrinsically an XOR characteristic, because the transistor is ON
when PG = CG, ie. PG Â© CG = 1, and consequently is OFF when PG @ CG = 1.
