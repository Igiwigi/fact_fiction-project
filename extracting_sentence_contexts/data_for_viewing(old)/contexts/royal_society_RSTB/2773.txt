pure-bred Hehinus larvee except that nearly all had small second arm-bars and anterior
body-skeletons. In nearly all other cases no plutei were obtained, though sometimes
blastulee or gastrule, the number of which was usually larger if the e xos had been
kept several hours or treated with dilute sea water before fertilisation. On June 12,
some eggs of Strongylocentrotus were fertilised by Spherechinus and yielded a few
plutei ; these were rather like the converse hybrid in size and shape, but more like
Strongylocentrotus in the skeleton. They differed from the corresponding hybrid
made with Hchinus in being much smaller.

More than fifty experiments were also made in July with Arbacia pustuosa. It
was hoped that this species might prove free from the disadvantages associated with
Spherechinus granularis, and it has several points in its favour, the chief of which
are a very well-marked skeleton, and the fact that when ripe, abundant eggs and
sperm are shed by simple pressure of the thumb on the mouth of the urchin, Eggs
or sperm can, therefore, be obtained from the same urchin at different times and so
the sexual cells which have been kept or otherwise treated can be compared with
fresh ones.

Eggs of Spherechinus, Echinus and Strongylocentrotus all gave a small proportion
of blastulee when treated in July with Arbacia sperm, but no plutei were reared. Of
the converse crosses, the only satisfactory plutei were obtained from Arbacia 9 x
Spherechinus  , which closely resembled pure-bred Arbacia larvae, but were smaller
and less regular. The eggs of the Arbacia were treated in all the ways described in
the last section with the Spharechinus Â¢ x Strongylocentrotus 3 hybrids, but no
marked differences were observed except in size and healthiness. In December, 1900,
