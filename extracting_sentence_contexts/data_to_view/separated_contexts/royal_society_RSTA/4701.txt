Here V4 is a multi-sorted structure, each sort of which is a Zariski geometry (a notion to be defined in tw
§2). An essential part of the multi-sorted structure V_4 are morphisms between sorts functorially :
agreeing with embeddings between certain sub algebras of A, which makes the left-to-right arrow :g
a functor between a category of those subalgebras A and sorts V4 of Vy. This functor, in fact, :8
defines a quite rich sheaf over the category of subalgebras. This makes an interesting point of :
contact of our approach with the topos-theoretic approach to foundations of physics suggested
by Isham and Butterfield and developed by Isham, Déring and others; see [4]. In that approach,
V. is supposed to be a topos.
