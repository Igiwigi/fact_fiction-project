48°735 : 49°167, and therefore the sizes of all the individuals in Group 1 are multiplied
by 1:0089 and they are then treated as having been born under the same conditions
as the standard group.

Of course the assumption is here made that the difference between the groups is
due to environmental conditions and not to genetic differences between the lines or
clones composing the different groups. This assumption is justified by the fact that
in different generations the successive groups—arranged in order of time of birth—do
not bear the same relations to one another as regards the size of the individuals,
though the same clones or lines appear in the main in the same grouping in each
generation. Thus for example the groups in the polyclonal population, numbered in
order of time of birth, when arranged in order of the mean size of the individuals in
each group give in Generation 2—4, 5, 3, 6, 2, 1, and in Generation 5—7, 5, 1, 2, 6, 3; 4,

and in the monoclonal population in Generation 4—1, 2, 5, 7, 4, 6, 8, and in
Generation 5—7, 3,6, 2, 5, 4, 1. (The increase, in the later generations, of the period
between the first and last births of each generation accounts for the greater number
of groups in the later generations.)
