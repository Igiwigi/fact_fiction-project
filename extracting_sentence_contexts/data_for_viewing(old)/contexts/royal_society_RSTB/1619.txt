Weberian mechanism is related to some form of pressure adjustment,

4. If the conclusion at which we have arrived be adroigsible, the further question—
Whot: advantage does the Fish derive from the possession of «a pressaye register by
which it becomes acquainted with the varying degrees of hydrostatic pressure to
which it is exposed? or, In what way does the antl respoud to the sensory impulses
communicated to ils central neryous system by the Weberian mechanism and the
co-adapted parts of the internal eur! is one to which ib is very difficult to retara a
satisfackory answer. That the Weberian mechanism is of great functional importance
to the Vish possessing it admits of no doubt. [1 is extremely improbable that so
complicated aud highly specialized a mechanism would have been evolved did it not
confer some exceptional advantage upon its possessors, and that this is the case seenis
to be clearly demonstrated by the significant fact that the presence of a Weberia
mechanism is characteristic of nearly all the dominwit families of freshwater Telesstei,

Sime light may possibly be thrown on this difficult question by a closer comparison
of what is experimentally known of the methods of pressive adjustment in Fishes in
general, ane in the Osturiophysem, than has hitherto been made; and if no satis-
factory conclusion can be arrived at in this way, some clue at least may be gained u&
to the dircetion iu which the solution of the problem must be sought fur in the
‘fotune.
