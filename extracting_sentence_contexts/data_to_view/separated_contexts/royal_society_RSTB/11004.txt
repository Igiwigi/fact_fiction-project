Several
families of the molecular chaperones include large numbers of
proteins. For example, the Hsp40 family contains 50 members. The fact that the number of human molecular chaperones and
protein-folding catalysts is probably in the region of 150 proteins
underlies the enormous complexity of the cell stress response. The cell stress protein families can be subdivided into molecular
chaperones, which aid protein folding without changing the
client protein in any way, protein-folding catalysts such as
protein disulfide isomerases, which catalyse SH-:-S-S- intercon-
versions, and peptidyl prolyl isomerases, which catalyse cis :
trans isomerization of prolines and thus induce chemical
changes in their client proteins [19]. The protein-folding cata-
lysts can also be involved in redox interactions, and this

phenomenon of oxidation and reduction both within and out-
side the cell is now recognized as being a major modulator of
biological behaviour (e.g. [20]).
