taken on infinitely often, so we must have, for a subsequence (not relabelled), g;(x) =b, i=1,2,....
Thus, b € S. If b is not already equal to x, we can find a g € G such that ¢(b) = x. Then we note that
&i(x) =x, i=1,2,.... Since they fix a point, the infinite number of distinct elements ¢¢; represent
pure orthogonal transformations about that point.

For each x € S let Gy = {g € G: g(x) =x}. The above shows that each G, is an infinite group.
We claim that if S contains more than one point, then all points of S lie on a line, and this line
is invariant under Gx. Suppose x’ € S,x’ # x. Since Gx is an infinite group of isometries fixing x,
then G,(x’) is a collection of points of S on a sphere centred at x with radius |x’ — x|. Since S is
discrete, it follows that an infinite number of elements of G, must map x’ to some x” € S. Let
Ix ={g € Gx: 9(x’) =x"} be this infinite set of elements. Let a € Jy and let J, = {ga~1: g € Jy}. If ge Ji
then clearly g(x”) =x". This shows that there are an infinite number of distinct isometries in Gx
that also fix x” # x. We claim that there are in fact an infinite sequence of proper rotations in Gx
with this property. If that were not true, then there would necessarily be an infinite number of
improper rotations g; € Gx, gj = (Q;|(I — Q;)x), that satisfy Q;e =e, e=x” — x. But then, 8% are
an infinite number of distinct proper rotations that fix both x and x”.

Clearly, then, all elements of S must be on the line x + Ae, 4 € R. For, if z is not on this line,
then the infinite number of distinct proper rotations in G, C G would map z to an infinite number
of distinct points on a circle.

It follows that S is then a one-dimensional objective atomic structure. Obviously, this includes
structures with one or two points. If S has at least three points x;,x2,x3, consecutively along a
line, then using the concept of an objective structure (identical environments), it is clear that x3
must have a neighbour x4 = x3 + (x2 — x1). Continuing in this fashion, we generate one of the two
