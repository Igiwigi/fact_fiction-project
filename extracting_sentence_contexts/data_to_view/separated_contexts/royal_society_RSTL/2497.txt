How far this is verified, within the limits of errors of observation
and of local interference with the full development of the effects of the magnetic
force, has not yet been inquired into. Indeed, till this plane has been determined it
would be impossible to conduct the inquiry in a direct manner; and as only one of
these points is yet actually assigned with any close degree of approximation, we
are not yet ina condition to enter upon the inquiry. Still, these facts combined with
observations relative to other phenomena, especially respecting dip and intensity,
(the variation for obvious geometrical reasons included,) accurately made, might
furnish important aid in a tentative determination of the plane itself; the method of
proceeding in which must be sufficiently obvious to those inquirers to whose minds
the geometry of coordinates is familiar.

08) 248 MR. DAVIES ON TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. In conclusion of the present paper I shall, though I have not been able to decom-
pose the equation which results from (77.) and (78.) into factors, yet hazard the con-
Jecture of its being even in its /iteral form capable of such a resolution ; 80 that the
component equations are, when yiewed simultaneously, the one essentially imaginary
with the values which render the other real.
