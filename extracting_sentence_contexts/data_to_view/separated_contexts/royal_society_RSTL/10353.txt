Festuca loliacea, which is hardly more than a variety of F. pratensis, has only been
found in the samples from two plots, and, like Festuca elatior, in quite insignificant
quantity. As compared with Festuca ovina, which is one of the most prevalent grasses on the
plots, F. pratensis is rapidly and greatly diminishing. This may possibly arise from
the fact that 7. pratensis is not 80 hardy as F. ovind, is less sturdy in habit, has a less
branched root-growth, fewer stolons, a greater evaporating surface from its broader
leaves, which, together with its less extensive root-development, may afford a reason
why F. pratensis does not resist drought 80 well as . ovind. Bromus mollis.
