NA however, will show that the deduced values agree as well together as can be expected,
5 considering that the results may be modified by the presence of carbon, snIphur, &c.
Z In cases where we may assume that we have only solutions of one metal in another, the
5 concordance in the deduced yalues is very great; in fact, when we experiment with
DP metals whose conducting-power in a pure state is known, and when the impurity 1s
Sonly dissolved in it, then the deduced conducting-power agrees almost exactly with
= that found experimentally.
= For resistance-thermometers, as described by S1eEMENS®, the use of an iron wire would
give much greater differences for the same increment of temperature than copper; for
© the resistance of pure copper wire increases for each degree about 0:4 per cent., whereas
3 that of pure iron increases about 0-6 per cent. for each degree.
S When we found that iron decreased in conducting-power between 0* and 100* more
S than the pure metals (and here again we will call attention to the fact that we have
= as yet found no alloy to decrease in conducting-power between 0? and 100? to a greater
= extent than that which the pure metals composing it would do), we thought that its
S being a magnetic body might poxsibly be the reason of it ; but after having tested
= thallium, and found that the conducting-power of that metal also decreases more than
YZ that of the pure metals, we knew that this could not well be the case, for thallium is
E strongly diamagneticf, Hearing, however, that Professor W6nLER possessed specimens
S of pure cobalt and nickel wire prepared by M. DeviLLe, we wrote and asked him to lend
them to us; this he immediately did, and on testing them we obtained the following
