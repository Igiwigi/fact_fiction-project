HAWKINS ON THE LANTERN AND GIRDLE OF

VI. Summary anp ConcLUsIONs
(1) General

Optical investigation of a transverse section of the lantern of Cidaris shows that
the calcite of the pair of maxille united by an interpyramidal muscle is in one
orientation, while that of the pair that constitutes a pyramid is not. This fact gives
strong support to the view that the maxille are paired radial structures, and that
their association into interradially situated pyramids is a secondary feature. The
teeth (which seem to be crystallographic units) are thus the only truly interradial
parts of the lantern. Secondary additions to the perignathic girdle (capping) are found to occur on the
interambulacral ridges as well as on the ambulacral processes in many of the Centre-
chinoida.
