EXPERIMENTS. The simplicity and uniformity of the experiments here de-

attention; and I must again repeat, that the minutiae of analysis
did not form part of my present plan, which was only to sketch
an outline, comprehending the most prominent chemical cha-
. racteristics of certain bodies appertaining to the animal king-
dom, which hitherto had been but little or not at all examined ;
s0 that this outline (although defective) might serve as a chain
of connection, and as a basis, upon which a more perfect super-
structure may in future be gradually raised; and it appeared
evident, that this would be most easily and speedily executed,
by following a systematical and comparative plan. For this
reason, a great part of my attention was directed towards ascer-
taining, in these animal substances, the presence and general
proportions of carbonate and phosphate of lime; these being
the materials essentially employed by nature to communicate
rigidity and hardness to certain parts of animals, such as shell
and bone; and, although some other substances, as magnesia,
Silex, iron, with some alkaline and neutral salts, might be occa-
Sionally present in small proportions, (and indeed were at times
detected,) yet, as these appear to have but little influence on the
general characters of the bodies which were examined, I did not,
for the present, think proper to take particular notice of them. The next object was, to examine the nature of the substance
in and upon which the hardening or ossifying principles were
secreted and deposited ; and it seemed to me that the best mode
to do this, was to compare and examine this substance in the
various states in which it appeared, when deprived of the harden-
ing or ossifying matter.
