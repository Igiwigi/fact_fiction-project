ing being experienced at night time compared with day time,
with resulting reductions in temperature tolerance and fitness
measures [108].

Another important temporal component is the age-
dependency of reaction norms. The environment influences
phenotypes during development for most morphological
traits, so reaction norms often have an ontogenic component
[34,109], and more generally plasticity is likely to change with
life stages, as shown in many studies [110]. A reaction norm
might be constructed for each life stage, but the challenge is
then to integrate them into an overall response in temporally
changing environments, accounting for the fact that con-
ditions at one life stage might influence reaction norms at a
subsequent life stage. Empirical studies have just started
integrating temporal and ontogenic aspects in the study of
reaction norms, notably for tolerance curves [34,106,111]
and the evolution of age-dependent plasticity also is a
relatively new topic for theory [112].

A final temporal issue is that the reaction norm is likely to
depend on environments experienced in previous gener-
ations, through transgenerational plasticity [113,114]. This is
thought to chiefly occur by adaptive epigenetics, whereby
modifications to chromosomes triggered by environmental
