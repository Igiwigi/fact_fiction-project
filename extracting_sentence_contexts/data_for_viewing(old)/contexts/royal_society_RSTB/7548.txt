in other cases, but of course it can give no information on events below the thermocline.

The calculated period of the third mode, on the other hand, shows greater change with
varying choice of the /,/h, level, largely because of the influence this choice has on the
value assigned to (~,—p2). Change in level of the h,/h, interface (bottom section of table 2)
affects the period less. Perhaps the most important result of the above calculations is that,
in spite of the errors inherent in the assumption of an homogeneous middle layer, the
predicted period of the third mode is consistent with the observed deflexion of 40 to 50h
period in the lower isotherms. During the two shorter intervals (1 and 2), the calculated
period of the third mode is respectively longer and shorter than that for the whole interval.
The result clearly depends greatly on the value assigned to (p,;—p,). The observations
in figure 10 were not extended long enough to decide whether a progressive decrease
in period of the third mode did in fact occur.

We may now examine the partition of the modes between the two interfaces. Using
equation (A 14), it is possible to calculate the ratio, f, of vertical displacement of the upper
to that of the lower interface for each mode. As the densities are very nearly unity, (A14)
may be recast into a more convenient form:

BO= (ho/H®) (03— 2) + (ha/hg +1), (8)
in which i=modality, 2 or 3, and H“ is a root of (6). Using the entries in table 2, the
ratio £@ for the second mode varies between 1-30 and 1-39 for interval no. 1, between
1:10 and 1-23 for interval no. 2 and between 1-23 and 1-38 for the whole interval. The
respective ranges of the ratio # for the third mode are: — 0-13 to — 0-08, —0-22 to —0-15
and —0-10 to —0-14. There is no need to set all these values out in detail, but if we give
