The top of the figure, where the bifurcating stems are grouped,
probably lies not far from the centre of the false stem ; the right and left ends of
the section, occupied by the stoutest petioles and by roots mostly running ver-
tically, form parts of the peripheral zone. The actual exterior of the trunk is not
preserved. An important fact is the difference in the size and orientation of the petioles
between the central and peripheral parts of the trunk. In the central part, to
