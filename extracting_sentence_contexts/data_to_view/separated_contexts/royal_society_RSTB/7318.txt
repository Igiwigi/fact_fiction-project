Such a restriction, if it takes place
at all, must be limited to a comparatively brief period during the Karroo winter. It is
non-existent in the warmer areas of the country. It may provide a partial explanation of
the fact that, in the Karroo, the population of Lucilia is sometimes lower than might be
expected from its obvious advantages over other species. Since it touches the question of carcass suitability, the observation of Fuller regarding the
apparent predilection of certain species of flies for the carcasses of certain kinds of animals,
quoted earlier, also belongs here if confirmed. Such a deliberate exercise of choice would
no doubt be ascribed to some suitable factor.
