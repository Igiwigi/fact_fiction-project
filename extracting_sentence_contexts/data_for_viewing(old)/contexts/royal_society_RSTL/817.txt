it will be seen that little dependence can be placed on the
specific gravities of stones, so far as regards their repulsive
powers, although the increase is certainly in favour of their
specific gravities. But there would appear to be some unde-
fined law in the connection of bodies, with which the specific
gravity has little to do. Thus, statuary marble has a specific
gravity above Aberdeen granite, yet a repulsive power not
much above half the latter. Again, hardness is not altoge-
ther a characteristic of strength, inasmuch as the limestones,
which yield readily to the scratch, have nevertheless a repul-
sive power approaching to granite itself.

It is a curious fact in the rupture of amorphous stones, that
pyramids are formed, having for their base the upper side of
the cube next the lever, the action of which displaces the

the sides of which, if. continued, might cut the cubes in the
direction of their diagonals.
