free, the original condition of affairs would be restored, the penis would lie in the
middle line, and the sharp turn be taken out of the left duct ; both ducts would Pass
under a single nerve-cord, one on each side. The present arrangement appears to be a
commencement of the unilaterality found in Scolopendride. In two of the males
opened, merely to observe the sex, one testis with its accessory gland and vesicula
seminalis was much larger than the other, showing a further step towards unilaterality,
The testes are packed in the body one a little way above the other beside and behind
the intestine.

The convoluted tube above the testis contains no spermatozoa or vesicles of eyolu-
tion, but only large fine granulated or transparent gland-cells, being, in fact, very like
in structure to the slime-glands of the animal. These tubes are probably diluent
accessory glands of the testis, and might be called © prostates.” ;

The testes examined contained abundance of vesicles of evolution, with spermatozoa
in various stages of development. The structures observed are shown in Plate LXXIV.
figs. 2, 3, & 4. The earliest forms of the cells which produce the spermatozoa appear to
be those seen in fig. 2, connected together in a row and filled simply with fine granules,
'The cells are flattened by mutual appressure, and probably multiply by division. The
cells enlarge and acquire a transparent nucleus. In the next stage observed the cells
are again enlarged, and contain from three to as many as six vesicles of evolution,
sometimes only one or two; these are shown in fig. 3, a, b, c, as seen with a HArTNAck's
No. 10, ocular 4. The large cells haye perfectly transparent contents without granules.
