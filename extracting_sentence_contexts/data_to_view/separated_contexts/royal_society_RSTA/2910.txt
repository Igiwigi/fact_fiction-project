In generic models, the tail may exactly vanish only under special choices of the speed of the
travelling breather (or the system parameters) [64,65]. In connection with the above phenomena,
travelling breathers excited from localized initial perturbations are often followed by a small
oscillatory tail, see e.g. [34,37] in the context of granular crystals. Part of the above phenomenology can be transposed to the present setting despite the fact
that equation (1.4) is fully nonlinear. Indeed, instead of weakly modulated phonons, the tails can
involve nonlinear periodic travelling waves of (1.4) taking the form [32]
