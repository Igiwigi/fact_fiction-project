Oxtey, ‘ Nature,’ No. 4, 1915. The core or electrostatic part of the atom is at a much greater
distance from the atomic boundary than are the circular currents which give rise to the magnetic
properties. As the intensity of the magnetic field due to a circular current varies inversely as the cube of
the distance, and as in a crystalline structure two such circuits may approach so as almost to touch, each
electron describing a small circle, the local magnetic forcive may be sufficiently large to account for the facts. The view that the cohesive force in crystalline media is of a magnetic nature was expressed in Part II.
of this research, pp. 83-86. It was there stated that in a diamagnetic crystalline medium the molecules
are held together by the local magnetic forces due to the revolving electrons.
