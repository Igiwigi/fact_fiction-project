It also follows from the principle of likelihood. Again it has been shown that on the
basis of the information available no better test could be devised for the hypothesis
under consideration.

VI.—Summary oF RESutts.

1. A new basis has been introduced for choosing among criteria suitable for testing
any given statistical hypothesis, Hy, with regard to an alternative H,. If 6, and 0,
are two such possible criteria and if in using them there is the same chance, «, of rejecting
H, when it is in fact true, we should choose that one of the two which assures the
minimum chance of accepting Hy when the true hypothesis is H,.

2. Starting from this point of view, since the choice of a criterion is equivalent to
the choice of a critical region in multiple space, it was possible to introduce the con-
ception of the best critical region with regard to the alternative hypothesis H,. This
is the region, the use of which, for a fixed value of ¢, assures the minimum chance of
accepting Hy when the true hypothesis is H,. The criterion, based on the best critical
region, may be referred to as to the most efficient criterion with regard to the alternative
H,.

3. It has been shown that the choice of the most efficient criterion, or of the best
critical region, is equivalent to the solution of a problem in the Calculus of Variations.
