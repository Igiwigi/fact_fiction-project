One side was pressurized and the cylinders were placed in a Dos
water bath. When the valve was opened there was no change in the water temperature (because :=
no overall work was done and the internal energy of the air remained the same) but further : Sy
measurements showed that the cylinder subject to the expansion was cooled while that subject 2
to the compression was heated by almost exactly the same amount. The experiments gave values aed
for J of 820, 814 and 760 foot-pounds per Btu. 22
The paper [10] ended with the following bold statement: : xs
The principles I have adopted lead to a theory of the steam-engine very different from 72

the one generally received, but at the same time much more accordant with facts. It is : 8

the opinion of many philosophers that the mechanical power of the steam-engine arises
simply from the passage of heat from a hot to a cold body, no heat being necessarily lost
during the transfer. This view has been adopted by Mr.
