At
the same limit it will not generally be the case that 'T (&;) will vanish and from E (23)
we then deduce the relation

x (6) x (0) = 22. Poe Pe, w lat2b)

To incorporate this deduction into the method of solution one may proceed as before
until equation E (14) is reached and then take account of the fact that y_ = B/log & when & is small, and yy, = when & is nearly equal to 2k, B and C being

C
log (2k — &x)
regarded as undetermined multipliers to be found subsequently, Equation E (16)
will then become
