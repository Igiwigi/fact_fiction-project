However, interestingly, there was no significant
difference between 5-year-olds in the chose-asocial—received-
social condition (M=7s; s.d.=9s) and the chose-asocial—
received-asocial condition (M= 66s; s.d.= 119s), p=0.781. The large standard deviation scores for latencies reflect that
28% of all children were unsuccessful and had their score
capped at 360 s. To account for this and the fact of uneven cell-
sizes and variances, it was especially important to take the
robust measures mentioned above; levels of lack of success are
reported with the further statistical description of conditions in
the electronic supplementary material, S1. Taken together these
results indicate that for 3-year-olds, those who received social
input, whether choosing it or not, were faster at the task than chil-
dren who learned asocially. This effect held for 5-year-olds who
chose to learn socially, but 5-year-olds who chose to learn aso-
cially were equally fast at the task no matter the learning style
they were allocated to receive (as depicted in figure 2).

(ii) Adults’ task latency
An ANOVA of AF difficulty, stated learning preference,
and having the preference met or violated was used to

examine main effects, where n was large enough to compare,
and as with children the first trial data were used, F343 =
8.92, p < 0.001.
