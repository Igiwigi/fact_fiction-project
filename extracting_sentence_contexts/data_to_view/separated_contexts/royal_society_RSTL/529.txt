cd is the pipe fastened to the end of the
rod; the end of this pipe has a screw, which passes through a
nut, and acts against the end of the lever d, whose centre of
motion is g, and whose other extremity is f, where there is a
small piece of hard steel with a notch, for the reception of the
plumb-line fþ, suspended from g. Against the upper surface of
the arm gd, a helical spring continually presses downwards ; it
is fastened above the end of the lever, at e ; by which means, the
arm gd is constantly pressed against the end of the pipe, ob-
viating the possibility of 'any play or shake of the lever, round
its centre g.

The same figure contains an elevation of the frame-work just
described, as seen by an eye in the plane of the diaphragm pro-
duced. It is necessary that it should be closely inspected, for
the purpose of obtaining an adequate idea of its construction. In this figure, av is a small cylinder, with a screw and loose
collar at the end », for fastening the plumb-line, which goes
over the notch », and passes through a hole in the upper part
of the axis at f, and out again at þ, almost touching the mother-
of-pearl at p, sru is a strong spring, fixed at s, through the
middle of which, at r, passes a screw, which is, in fact, an ad-
Justing screw, for bringing the plumb-line close to the dot on
the surface of the diaphragm: and here it is necessary to ob-
serve, that the plane of the divided arch ard that of this dia-
phragm, are one and the same when produced. There is no
part of the instrument more complete than the apparatus for
suspending the plumb-line, and that which regards the dot. I


402 An Account of the Measurement

Shall now return to a farther consideration of the construction
of the axis.
