on the charts for the summer months, especially May and August. It coincides als
approximately with the line separating the westerly monsoon current of Central Indic
from the easterly monsoon of the Ganges valley. |

The Central Provinces to the south of the Satpooras, and even for 8ome distance tc
the north of that chain, receive their rains wholly from the west coast. Much of thit
country is very hilly, but it is not all of this character; and the numerous feeders of the
Godavery drain a system of plains, which have a mean eleyation of less than 1000 feet
above the sea, and fall away to the south-east. Yet the rainfall is here heavier than on
the Deccan plateau nearer the Ghits, which must of course be crossed by the rain;
bearing winds, excepting such portions as may pass up the valleys of the Taptee and
Nerbudda. This appears anomalous; but I think the explanation may be found partly
in the facts to which General STracuey drew attention in the paper I have before
referred to (page 596). He there shoyed that the distribution of vapour vertically in the

atmosphere, on the hypothesis of independent atmospheres of dry air and water-vapour,
is inconsistent with the known ratio of temperature decrement with elevation, inasm 1
as such a distribution would require the existence at comparatively moderate __

violent electrical discharges, and the barometric column invariably rises rapidly on their approach, i
to the extent, of 0-1 inch ; 80 that, on looking back through a series of diurnal barometric curyes, it is ensy
