chiefly of much elongated columnar cells with their long axes at right angles to the
outer surface. There is no indication of the process of mucus-secretion which takes
place in the lens of Sphenodon.

In the lamprey the retina, as in Sphenodon, is made up of sense-cells, ganglion-
cells and nerve-fibres, and supporting cells; but there are conspicuous differences
with regard to the minute structure and arrangement of these elements.

The supporting cells are arranged radially in the inner part of the retina, between
the sense-cells, and I have not been able to trace them right through to the outer
surface. Their nuclei lie near the middle of the thickness of the retina. In
Sphenodon the supporting cells are most conspicuous in the outer part of the retina,
where their nuclei are also situated. More important is the fact that in the lamprey
the so-called pigment undoubtedly lies in the supporting cells, which are consequently
often called pigment-cells. The pigment, however, cannot be compared with that in

the pineal eye of Sphenodon, for, as is well known, it is white and consists probably
of phosphate of lime. Another peculiarity of the pigment-cells (in Geotria) is that
their inner ends project as rounded knobs into the cavity of the eye.

The sense-cells are not unlike those of Sphenodon, but their inner extremities are
