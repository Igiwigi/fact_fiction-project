implementation; yet some impressive but limited progress has been made on the
experimental side. It may be that radical new insights will be needed before true
practical progress can come about. One possible area of advance might, for exam-
ple, be in the collective quantum behaviour of charged particles (Lee & Schofield,
Millennium II). In the related subject of quantum cryptography, however, practical
devices are already at hand (Mosca et al., Millennium II).

Moving from the tiny scales, where quantum effects most usually make their
mark, to astronomical and cosmological dimensions, we find, still, that we can by no
means ignore the extraordinary effects of quantum mechanics. Remarkably, the con-
sequences of the intrinsically quantum-mechanical phenomenon of maser action have

een observed in astrophysical situations (in fact, some 35 years ago). The source of
hese effects was subsequently explained, and such things are now used as an astro-
hysical observational tool (Gray, Millennium I). Moreover, the subject of cosmology,
which is concerned with the largest distances of all, cannot be studied theoretically
in a modern and satisfactory way without addressing the role of quantum mechan-
ics. The reason for this is that the structure of the early universe—which means the
Big Bang and what came immediately afterwards—depended crucially on a subtle
interplay between space-time geometry and quantum fields, and ultimately upon the
still missing theory of quantum gravity. Here the scope for theoretical speculation is
arge, and a wealth of yet-untested ideas play important roles in discussion. There
is impressive observational support for an early extremely high-density state of the
universe, closely in accord with the predictions made by Friedmann in the 1920s, and
y Gamow and others in the late 1940s, using Einstein’s general theory of relativity.
