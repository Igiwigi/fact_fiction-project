terms of the Standard, thus :—
Set (1) + Set (2) = 20 Standards + 2 (8, + T)).

After the completion of each experiment for the equivalent, the comparisons are
carried out in the reverse order, and if 8, and T, denote the quantities corresponding
to S,, T, we may take the electromotive force of the battery during the experiment
to be the arithmetical mean of that determined at the beginning and end. The
relation, written as above, would be

Set (1) + Set (2) = 20 Standards + (S, + 8, + T, + T,).

A small correction is necessary owing to the fact that the temperature of the
Cupboard Clarks may not have been the same during their comparison with the
battery as it was while they were being compared with the Standard, We may,
without sensible error, assume that all Cupboard Clarks varied equally, and that,
therefore, the alteration due to temperature changes, for each cell measured in
electromotive force, is expressed by the difference of 4 (a+ a3) and $(a, + ag).
Hence we correct for the change of the ten cells by adding to S, the quantity
5 (a4,—a,). A similar correction applies to the final comparison, so that the complete
relation of electromotive force is given by

Set (1) + Set (2) = 20 Standards + (S, + 8, + T, + T,) + 5 (ay — a + a — a).

The temperature of the Standard to which the equation applies is the mean
