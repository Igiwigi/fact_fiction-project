syntypicizm, this may happen in seyeral different ways.
* Lastly, if there be a polyedron having the same number of yertices and faces, and if the vertices and faces
in any order be represented by
abed. .KLMN..,
and the faces and yertices in a certain order be represented by

ABCD.. klmn..*
Then, forming the 8ubstitution symbol

ABCD.. i#Imn..abed..KLMN..,

if, operating with this upon the symbol system of the polyedron, we reproduce such symbol system, 5. e. in
fact, if the polyedron be polar-syntypic with itself, the polyedron is said to be autopolar; and in accord-
ance with a preceding remark, this may happen in several different ways. It is clear that the substitution
symbo], operating on the symbol system of the vertices, must give the s8ymbol system of the faces, and
conversely ; but operating on the symbol system of the edges, it must reproduce such symbol system of the
edges: and this last condition will by itself suffice to make the polyedron autopolar, . e. the polyedron will
be autopolar if the substitution s8ymbol, operating on the symbol system of the edges, reproduces 8uch
symbol system.‚Äù
