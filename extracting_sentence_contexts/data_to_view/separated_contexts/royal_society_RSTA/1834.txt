In the tables shown in figures 10
and 11, group 3 is shown as containing either Sc, Y, La and Ac or Sc, Y, Lu and Lr. The second option is clearly preferable since it is the only one of these two tables that maintains
an increasing order of atomic number across every single-period length. In fact the table shown
in figure 11 has not appeared in print, as far as this author is aware, presumably because of the
anomalies that it would imply regarding increasing atomic number. This is another case for which thinking about a 32-column table if not actually adopting the
longer format can be useful. Part of the reason why group 3 has traditionally been regarded as
consisting of Sc, Y, La and Ac is due to the predominance, not to say virtual monopoly, that the
