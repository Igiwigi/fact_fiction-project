through A, and do not reach the critical value,

The same is true of all the rest of PotseviLLe's experiments except those made on a
much larger pipe, diameter 0'65 millim,, hence it is thought sufficient to plot only one,
namely BB,

CC shows the experimental results obtained with the pipe 0'65 millim. diameter,
and these reach the critical value as given by the formula, and then diverge from the
line.

It is important to notice, however, that the points are not taken directly from
PotsEvILLE's experiments, which have been 8ubjected to a correction rendered
necessary by the fact that PorsevILLE did not measure the Tesistance by ascertaining
the pressure at two points in the pipe, but by ascertaining the pressure in the vessels
from which and into which the water flowed through the pipe, 80 that his resistance
includes, besides the resistance of the Pipe, the pressure necessary to impart the initial
velocity to the water. This fact, which appears to have been entirely overlooked, had
a very important influence on many of PorsevILLE's regults, PoIsRUILLE endeavoured
to ascertain what was the limit to the application of his law, and, with the exception

of his smallest tubes, sncceeded in attaining velocities at which the regults were no
longer in accordance with his law,
