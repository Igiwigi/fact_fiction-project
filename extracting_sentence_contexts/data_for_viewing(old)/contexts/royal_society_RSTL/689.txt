and contraction of timber, when divided in different directions
relative to the medulla of the tree, and I was not in posses-
sion of any fact which enabled me to prove the existence of
any such power, in a state of action, in the living tree. But
experiments, which I have made at different subsequent
periods, have afforded very satisfactory evidence of the pre-
sence of this power in a state of action in living trees, and
have also enabled me to ascertain some facts, which appear
interesting, and likely to prove useful in directing the proper
mode of application of wood for various purposes, in which
it is important that it should permanently retain its primary
extent and form. These experiments were made upon tim-
ber of many different kinds; but as the results were all very
nearly the same, I shall confine myself to those made upon
the oak, the ash, the beech, and poplar.

Some thin boards of the wood of two of the above men-
tioned species of trees, the ash and the beech, were cutin oppo-
site directions relative to their medulla, so that the convergent
cellular processes crossed the centre of the surfaces of some of
