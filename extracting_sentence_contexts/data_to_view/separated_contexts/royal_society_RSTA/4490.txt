Improved uncertainty assessment

If the pitfalls identified above are to be avoided, what should be done instead? How can agents
come closer to meeting the requirements of faithfulness and completeness and, more generally,
to engaging in good practice in uncertainty assessment? This section outlines some steps and
strategies for improved uncertainty assessment in support of decision-making.

13]n fact, Morgan [9, p. 7178] notes that a standard measure of overconfidence is the so-called ‘surprise index’, which is a
measure of how often the true value for a quantity lies outside an assessor’s 98% Cl. (The test focuses on quantities whose
true values are known.)

™In other situations, we might be able to argue that the risk of genuine surprise is negligible. Suppose I am prone to mild
headaches, which taking an aspirin has tended to help relieve in the past. If Inow have a mild headache in the same spot as
usual (but am otherwise feeling well), and I take an aspirin, it seems reasonable to think that the risk of a genuine surprise
when it comes to the outcome (ie. the risk of something dramatically different occurring due to a factor that I did not
recognize as even potentially relevant) is negligible.

The problem with adopting a one-size-fits-all approach to representing uncertainty is that it
can easily lead to reports that fail to approximately satisfy the faithfulness requirement, that is, 3
to reports that are significantly misleading about what an agent believes the extent of current :s
uncertainty to be.
