with the assistance of the tug, there was always a chance of raising a kite to at least
1000 feet, but it was not always possible to get sutlicient lifting power to raise the
instruments. On the other hand, there were a few days on which the wind equalled
or exceeded force 7, a moderate gale; on these days a kite could be, and in fact was,
sent up, but as the Committee were unable, for want of funds, to provide a spare set
of recording instruments, it did not seem advisable to risk the loss of the single set
by sending them up in very strong winds.

Between June 19 and August 26, 71 ascents were made with an average height ot
4200 feet (1280 metres). In 40 of these, with an average height of 5900 feet
(1798 metres), records from self-recording instruments were obtained. Those on
July 4 and 7 were from land, the others from the tug. The great advantage of a
steam vessel for this purpose is shown by the fact that whereas during the three
weeks when ascents were made from the land, it was only found possible to get a kite
up on ten occasions and the instruments on two occasions, during the seven weeks when
the tug was used 61 ascents were obtained ; a height of at least 1350 feet was reached


BY THE USE OF KITES OFF THE WEST COAST OF SCOTLAND, 1902. 125

on every day on which it was available, and the instruments were raised 38 times.
A far greater average height would have been obtained had there been a spare set of
recording instruments; as there was only one set, and as the risk of losing the
instruments is greatly increased by using additional kites, not more than two kites
were used for any ascent until the last week.
