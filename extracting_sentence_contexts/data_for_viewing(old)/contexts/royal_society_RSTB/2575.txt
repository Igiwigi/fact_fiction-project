1. There is an increased absorption of fluid from the surface of the body during
prevalence of pseudaconitine action ; probably also from the alimentary canal, this
heing favoured by the flat position often assumed, which facilitates passage of fluid
into the mouth.

2. This is, to a corresponding extent, productive of hydremia and of impaired
function, especially of cord and heart. Fluid accumulates in the tissues, but there is
no evidence that the kidneys fail in elimination, as a large amount of urine is found
in the bladder, and if the animal is removed to a dry or damp chamber, cedema is
drained off by this channel.

3. The fact that some cedema occurs in animals merely pegged and suspended in fluid
seems to indicate a change, probably vaso-motor, which causes increased absorption,
the same effect being produced, but to a greater extent, by the aconitines. This may
perhaps be best described as a reduction of a restraint upon absorption which is in
operation in the uninjured and unpoisoned animals.

4, Salt solution (7 per cent.) as the medium of immersion seems to be more
productive of cedema than is distilled water.

5. Pseudaconitine is more favourable to the production of cedema than are the
other two aconitines.
