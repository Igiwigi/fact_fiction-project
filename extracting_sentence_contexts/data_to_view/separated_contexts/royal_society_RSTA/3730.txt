This line can be traced
only on the eastern portion of the moon’s limb, and, unlike the chromosphere ares, it
is very variable in intensity, being strongly marked about the position angles 60° to
70°, and 100°, where the continuous spectrum is also strong, but extremely weak or
entirely absent in other parts of the limb. The results of measures of the corona line on this plate and No. 7 spectra are given
on p. 401. a [In the reproductions of the bright-line spectra shown in Plate 11, the position
Nangles may be inferred from the fact that the direction of dispersion is also the
Sdirection of the moon’s path across the sun, the point of second contact (P.A. 56°) Sbeing at the centre of the ares on the right-hand side, and third contact (P.A. 236°)
gat the centre on the left. The angles are reckoned from the north point through
east, south, and west.
