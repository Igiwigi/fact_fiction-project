control sample. The control sample was lightly shaken, to remove the effects of
incipient sedimentation, and both samples were then allowed to stand side by side,
until the red corpuscles had subsided sufficiently, or, more usually, were subjected
together to a very brief centrifugation. It was sufficient to place the tubes in the
centrifuge, to start the turbine until a speed of not more than 500 revolutions was
attained, and then to allow the rotor to come naturally to rest. This produced
a sufficient surface layer, practically free from red corpuscles, to enable a drop to be
taken conveniently for examination, without producing any significant sedimentation
of the platelets of the normal sample.

We made a number of attempts to obtain quantitative comparisons by counting
the platelets, and to facilitate this by staining. We soon reached the conclusion,
however, that numerical records gave a purely fictitious appearance of accuracy to
a comparison between normal samples, in which the platelets were separate and
evenly distributed, and abnormal samples, in which the few remaining in suspension
in the plasma were agglutinated into clumps. We found, however, that the use of the
