they were in a state of great activity, and the mercury rose to 63*3 Fanr., a differ-
ence of 1*3 Faun. Subsequent observations on the temperature of other species of
lepidopterous insects confirmed these observations ; and it was remarkable that the
amount of temperature in the laryz of different tribes of this order is pretty nearly
the same. On the 26th of June 1834 I examined the full-grown larva of Pavonia
minor, which like the preceding species had been at rest for several hours, and found
that the temperature of the atmosphere being 68?, the temperature of the insect was
only 68*3, The insect then became a little excited, and the mercury rose to 68*7 ;
and when till further excited to 68*9, and ultimately to 69*3, being a difference of
1*3 above that of the atmosphere, thus proving that the temperature of an inseet in-
creases immediately it becomes active, and that the increase is in Proportion to the
degree of activity, and probably also to the quantity of respiration of the insect.
From these facts it is sufficiently clear that individual insects possess a temperature
of body aboye that of the surrounding medium, and that the amount is not constant
