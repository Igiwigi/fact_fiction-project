animals, which were pregnant but were not lactating, may have become pregnant
at a post-lactation, not a post-partum, oestrus. Otherwise these animals could be
interpreted as having lost the litters they should have been suckling. It has been
suggested (p. 7) that one animal (S. 1257) might be in post-lactation pro-cestrus.

Two non-pregnant parous animals (S. 646 and 559) were obtained which showed
no signs of recent lactation. These must be considered to have stopped breeding
and to have entered upon a winter ancestrus. That obtained in February (S. 646)
weighed 10 gm and had only small follicles, but S. 559, obtained in March, weighed
only 7-5 gm and showed signs of follicular growth.

It seems probable that at the end of the season animals in lactation ancestrus pass
directly into winter ancestrus when the young are weaned. â€˜The fact that three of
the lactating ancestrous animals contain only small follicles and that several exhibit
intense follicular degeneration supports this suggestion.

The general character of the reproductive cycle in the shrew is illustrated
diagrammatically in fig. 4.
