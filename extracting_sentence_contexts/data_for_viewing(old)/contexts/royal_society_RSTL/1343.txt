These estimations, I do not however venture to give, as
entirely correct. In the analytical experiments, there are
probably sources of error, from the solution of a part of the
inflammable matter, and it possibly may retain alkali, which
cannot be separated by the acid. In the synthetical pro-
cess, in which washing is employed, and s0 small a quan-
tity of matter used, the results are till less to be depended
upon ; they must be considered only as imperfect approxima-
tions.

From the general tenour of the facts, it appears that the
combustible matter obtained from boracic acid, bears the same
relation to that substance, as sulphur and phosphorus do to
the sulphuric and phosphoric acids. But is it an elementary

inflammable body, the pure basis of the acid ? or is it not like
sulphur and phosphorus, compounded ?

Without entering into any discussjon concerning ultimate
elementary matter, there are many circumstances which favour
