flexural strength with increasing porosity [19]. At the scale of the ice thickness, the columnar Da
structure and stratification lead to significant strength anisotropy [18,20]. tw

However, instead of focusing on the role of the microstructure on mean mechanical properties, :
here we briefly discuss its impact on the spatial as well as temporal (as sea ice is known to age [19]) i
variability. If the literature on mean mechanical properties from laboratory experiments is vast, :S
datasets allowing a sound estimation of associated variability are scarce. Kamio et al. [21] reported :
a statistical analysis of tensile and bending strengths of first-year fast sea ice cored in the Okhotsk
Sea. They fitted the data with a Weibullâ€™s distribution, suggesting a weakest-link mechanism,
plausible for tensile fracturing [22], and linked this variability of the mechanical strength to
that of the microstructure. However, to ascertain the relevance of the weakest-link hypothesis,
a comparison of datasets obtained for different sample sizes is necessary [23]. As a matter of
fact, the strength distributions reported in [21] are close to Gaussian distributions, with standard
deviations of the order of the means. It indicates that very low local strengths (less than 100 kPa)
are not unlikely. Note that a significant variability of the compressive strength has also been
observed for fresh-water artificial granular (isotropic) ice [24]. In this case, the strength variability
is normally distributed as well [23], though with a smaller standard deviation/mean ratio
compared with the tensile or flexural strength of sea ice [21], as its only possible microstructural
origin is the polycrystalline structure.

Therefore, microstructural complexity of sea ice gives rise to a significant variability in local
mechanical strength. It is difficult however, from the existing literature, to estimate a correlation
length &m associated with either these microstructural characteristics or strength properties.
Existing data [21] from samples taken from the same ice plate but exhibiting a large variability
of strength suggest a small &m, that is below the ice thickness . At much larger (regional) scales,
