The consequence is that, as there is generally a little play in the Y's,
the knife edge is not always let down on the same parts of the agate plane. This may be best detected by holding a lighted candle behind the knife edge
when it is resting on the plane: by which method the smallest inequalities in
the points of contact are readily discernible. But, the fact is rendered $till
more evident by reversing the pendulum in the Y's, when a sensible difference
in the result generally takes place. Amongst the numerous pendulums in my
possession, I have not met with more than one, that does not differ in the
results by an appreciable quantity, when the pendulum is reversed in the Y's,
or turned half round in azimuth. If the knife edge and planes were perfectly

correct and true, there ought not to be any difference in the results, whichever
side of the pendulum is placed fronting the observer : how then are we to

account for a difference of upwards of two vibrations in a day which actually
occurs in one of the pendulums above alluded to !
