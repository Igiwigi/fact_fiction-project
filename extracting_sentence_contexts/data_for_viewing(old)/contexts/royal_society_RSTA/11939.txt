In order to test whether this is a solution, we differentiate totally, mul re
1, ¢,, ¢, and add, and we have

a) C) a\/a noe de, ob }
(i + Pigg + Peay) (a + “iy ? 55). +7 nt de “Oy ”

where the dashes outside the brackets indicate that in differentiation ¢, and c, '
be treated as constants.
In this equation the substitution p, =), ~) = ¢, will make the coefficient
disappear, but the other terms will generally not vanish, and therefore the |
parabolic points is not generally a solution of the differential equations of
congruency. :
It is, in fact, generally speaking, the cusp-locus of the first singular solution,
§ 45. Suppose, now, that the surface has a cuspidal curve. It may be shown
this is a solution.
For at any point («, y;, y:) on the surface, the equations

y= ee +b, Yo = cyt + de,
Mi== 0; oM/op = 0, ° &M/op? = 0
are satisfied by putting
Ee, bh =y — oe, by = Yo — Coe

if c,, cy ave determined by the equations
