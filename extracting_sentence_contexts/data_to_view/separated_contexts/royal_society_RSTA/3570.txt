The range of CO abundances varies significantly, ranging from less than 1% to 30% relative to
water. Of note is the fact that in the group of CO-rich comets, there are no SP comets—all are LP
comets. Figure 12 shows that while the comets with the most CO are LP comets, they are not the
ones known to be making their first passage through the inner solar system. This may suggest that
this is not an artefact of evolution, rather a native property of these comets; however more data are
clearly needed.
