It may well be that assimilation requires a wider stomatal
aperture than is necessary for respiration. And since economy in the use of water
s in most cases desirable, the partial closure at night would effect this economy at
Ahe most advantageous time. The fact that aquatic plants with a constant water
supply and an extremely moist atmosphere have open stomata at night may be
adduced to support this view. The theory has much in its favour, but it does not
exhaust the subject. * Lerrazs (86), p. 168.

+ Lerrcep (86), p. 183, is of opinion that no special biological meaning can be given to the nocturnal
closure.
