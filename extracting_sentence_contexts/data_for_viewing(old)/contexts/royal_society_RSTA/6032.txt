problems [14,16,17]. First, social norms greatly increase the predictability of people’s behaviour
[18] and thereby enable social coordination [2]. So indispensable to social life, they are defined
as the ‘cement’ [19], the ‘grammar’ [13] or the ‘glue’ [20] of society. Second, when enforced
through mechanisms such as gossip, ostracism and peer punishment, social norms can motivate
individuals to act against their self-interest [21,22]. Third, they provide simple instructions on
how to behave and indicate what behaviours are effective in achieving the common goal, without
needing to completely understand the often complex collective action problem [23]. Finally,
norms help to coordinate and stabilize behaviour also under changing macro conditions [24].
Societies with strong social norms are, for instance, better able to informally coordinate behaviour
under collective threats, like climate change and pandemics [8,16].

While social norms have long been of interest to scientists of a wide variety of disciplines,
empirical evidence of the causal relationship between a norm and behaviour is rare. In fact,
most social norm research takes the effect of social norms for granted and uses norms as a post
hoc interpretation of observed phenomena [25]. Being outcome-oriented, it seeks to answer the
question ‘Does intervention X change behaviour Y’? While this allows for a rapid transfer of
research to policy and implementation, this approach strongly hinders generalizing the effect
that an intervention has in changing a behaviour, because the way in which the intervention
works is largely left unexamined. Besides intuitions, there is little theoretical basis upon which
to rest the predictions for the applicability of a specific strategy on a new set of phenomena. To
fully understand the potential of these informal rules for guiding and changing behaviour, social
norms need to be explicitly measured and the mechanisms by which norms are hypothesized to
cause behaviour need to be assessed rigorously; especially if we want to identify ways in which
norms can be changed (spontaneously or intentionally).
