The iron lines in the meteorites have the same relative
intensity as those in the solar spectrum, and this is an indication that the tempera-
ture of the iron vapour, in the most valid iron vapour absorbing region of the sun, is
about the same as that of the electric are.

3. The results of the enquiry into the origins of the lines, in addition to those of
iron, may be thus summarised :—


ARC SPECTRUM OF IRON METEORITES. 1025

Substances certainly present. Substances probably present,
Manganese Strontium
Cobalt Lead
Nickel Lithium
Chromium Molybdenum
Titanium Vanadinm
Copper Didyminm
Barium Uranium
Calcium Tungsten
Sodium Yttrium
Potassium Osmium

| Aluminium

It is probable that the presence of the lines of copper in the are spectrum of the
meteorites is due to the fact that copper wire was used to bind the meteorites to the
poles of the arc lamp. I have not yet had an opportunity of repeating the photo-
graphs with specimens of the meteorites which have not come in contact with copper
in this way, but observations of the spark and flame spectra of other portions of the
same meteorite have not confirmed the presence of copper.

4, Of the 43 lines in the tables for which no origins have been suggested, from the
Kensington maps of metallic are spectra, 29 are apparently coincident with lines
mapped by Kayser and Runge in the iron spectrum, but which do not appear in the
Kensington photographs. ‘These are indicated in the tables by the letters K. and R.
(Kayser and Rune), in the column for remarks. As I pointed out in my paper on the Iron Spectrum, these are very probably due to
iron, as no other origins have been determined for them, their absence from the
Kensington photographs depending upon the short exposure necessarily given, as
explained in the paper.
