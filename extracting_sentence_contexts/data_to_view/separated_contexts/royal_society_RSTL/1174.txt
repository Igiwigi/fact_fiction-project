Dr. RussEL says, that the relation of VoLNEy is true ;
and that it is the amusement of the inhabitants, or rather of
the Europeans, to allure birds by throwing up pieces of bread
from the flat tops of the houses ; these birds, to the best of
his recollection, are the common gull (larus canus LINN.),
which appear only at certain seasons. But a fact more to the purpose of the present inquiry, is
what Dr. RussEL remembers often to have heard asserted by
the European sportsmen at Aleppo, and indeed sometimes ob-
served himself; namely, that in the most serene weather, when
not a speck could be seen in the sky, nor any object discovered
in the horizon of an extensive plain, a dog or other animal
killed by accident, or shot, and left behind by the sportsmen
as they traversed the country, in the space of a few minutes
was surrounded by birds, before invisible, either of the yul-
ture tribe or the sea eagles (oss/fragus LiNN.). Whether
these birds by vision were directed to their prey, or allured by
scent, he would not undertake to pronounce, but the phazno-
menon occasioned wonder ; and the more $0, as there was not
time for putrefaction to take place, which might be supposed
to diffuse scent to a great distance.
