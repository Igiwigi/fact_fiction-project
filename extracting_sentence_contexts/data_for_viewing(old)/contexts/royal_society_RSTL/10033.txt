nervous impulse may Ã¾e, separate discharges from the motor ganglia at one end of the
path reach the musele as separate impulses ab the other end.

So, too, I have spoken of the motor ganglia. in the venous sinus without meaning
thereby to assert that these ganglia may not extend slightly beyond the sinus into the |
auricular septum as asserted by Low1iT* (for as a matter of fact experiments which I
have made expressly for this purpose have convinced me of the truth of his assertion),
or that the other groups of ganglion cells found in different parts of the heart may
not upon occasion perform motor functions.

The whole question of the action of these different groups of nerve cells deserves
separate discussion. In this paper I have purpostly abstained from tha discussion
because my object is to describe certain definite well established facts rather than to
enlarge upon all the various topics connected with the theory of the heart's action.

In this first part of the paper, therefore, T have confined myself to the question of
the relation of the muscular tissue to the impulses coming to it, and have attempted to
prove not only that the normal beat of the heart is dependent upon separate impulses
coming to the cardiac muscle, but that, in addition, the muscular tissue is of such a
character that if from any cause the impulses discharged from the motor ganglia
should become too weak to canse a contraction, the rhythmical action of the heart can
still continue though at a slower rate, because each of these impulses, abortive though
it is to produce a contraction, increases the excitability of the muscle, and therefore
the latter responds rhythmically to every two or three of the impulses coming to it.
