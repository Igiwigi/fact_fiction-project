parts in 100,000.

A first experiment, in which a solution of pure silver nitrate was saturated with
silver nitrite (purchased as pure) by making a saturated solution of the latter and
dissolving the requisite quantity of silver nitrate in it, gave 1Â°11832 (24d) as the
equivalent. That the solution was saturated with nitrite was evident from the
copious precipitate of this salt which resulted when the silver nitrate crystals were
dissolved in it.

A second experiment, in which a 50 per cent. solution of silver nitrate was saturated
with nitrite by the addition of KNO, and then diluted and filtered, gave the value
111837 (52d) for the electrochemical equivalent. In this case the saturation of the
solution was evidenced by the fact that needles of silver nitrite actually crystallised
out from the solution on standing in a cool place.

The above experiments show clearly that silver nitrite even when present in
considerable quantity does not raise the electrochemical equivalent by more than
one part in 10,000 and can only be an unimportant impurity. In view of the yellow
tint of the nitrite crystals, which should be colourless when pure, we are by no means
certain that the slight increase which we have observed may not be due to hyponitrite
(vide infra) and not to the nitrite itself.

The influence of hyponitrite on the deposit does not appear to have been determined.
The salt was prepared by reducing sodium nitrite with sodium amalgam, neutralising
with acetic acid and precipitating with dilute silver nitrate solution. The yellow
