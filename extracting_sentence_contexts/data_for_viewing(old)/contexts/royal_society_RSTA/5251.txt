as follows: 1510, 1156 and 1013cm™!. The portable Delta Nu Advantage instrument detected
bands at 1514, 1154 and 1007 cm™!, which is in good agreement with values of 1513, 1153 and
1005cm7! reported by Jehlitka & Oren [27]. The positions of the first two bands in the Raman
spectra collected from the ESA prototype instrument are in good agreement with the other
instrument data; however, on comparison, the position of the 5(C—CHs3) band is shifted by 6 cm!
(figure 3b). For reference purposes, the sample from the orange layer was analysed by the 514nm
laboratory instrument, and the positions of the bands were observed at 1512, 1154 and 1007 cm7!.
The excitation wavelength of 514nm was the closest available laser that enables the use of the
resonance Raman effect. According to our previous and current data, the difference in the band
positions is not significant in the data taken at the 532 and 514nm excitation wavelengths. Oren
et al. [32] reported that the major pigments present in the orange layer, derived from the oxygenic
phototrophs, were myxoxanthophyll, echinenone and f-carotene. The pigments are occurring at
roughly the same concentration [32], and the resulting spectra are consistent with this fact.

The green layer is of special interest because the majority of the pigment content consists
of chlorophyll-a. In contrast to the carotenoid pigments, the chlorophylls do not cause the
resonance effect when 514, 532 or 785nm excitation wavelengths are used; therefore, no signal
from chlorophyll-a was observed in the spectra. The same carotenoid pigments are produced
as in the orange layer (myxoxanthophyll, echinenone and f-carotene; again, in approximately
the same ratios) [32]. Therefore, the Raman spectra should be quite similar, and indeed the
Raman bands from the ESA prototype are 1513, 1157 and 1009cm™!. Spectra recorded by the
Delta Nu Advantage instrument show bands at 1515, 1154 and 1004 cm! (mode values). The
relative wavenumber differences between the corresponding bands from the orange and green
layers are very small for the vj and vz bands (less than 1 cm™!, Delta Nu Advantage instrument;
or 1-3cm7!, ESA prototype instrument). The 5(C—CH3) band is shifted from 1007 (orange) to
