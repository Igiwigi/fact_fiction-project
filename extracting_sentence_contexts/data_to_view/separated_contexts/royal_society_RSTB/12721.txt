fold concentration (10.5 uM) of haemin and purified SRT1 were mixed for measurement. (e) Differential UV-visible spectra of haemin (0-25 M) as a function of
haemin concentration in the presence of CML100C (10 pM). (Inset) Plot of the absorbance value at 415 nm (dashed line) of haemin as a function of haemin
concentration. Data were fitted with nonlinear regression assuming one-site binding.
