will vary as the time elapsed since the light began to act. It will become greater
without limit. It is easily seen from SELLMEIER’s analysis that there is no tendency
for the natural vibrations excited by successive fluctuation to counteract one another.
As regards the forced vibrations, on the other hand, the phases are, so to speak,
arranged so that there shall be no accumulation of energy.

§ 69. For a frictionless vibrator, then, common homogeneous light will give a
continually-increasing motion in the natural mode; this feature being entirely due
to the irregularities.

But if there were a friction, however small, the motion would be prevented from
mounting up indefinitely. The vibrations started by the component trains would
not persist ; in fact we may expect to find that the natural vibration settles down to
a definite state, depending on the damping and the nature of the irregularities.

§ 70. The whole of this matter becomes quite simple on the application of Fourier.
Let us first try to solve

2+ pre = [8 cos (ut + w)du.

We are tempted to take for solution
