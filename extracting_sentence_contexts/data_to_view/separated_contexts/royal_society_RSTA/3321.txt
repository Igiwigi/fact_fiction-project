Therefore, if a mutant appears
that serves as a better template, but provides no catalysis, it will out-compete the wild-type
providing catalysis and thereby drive the entire hypercycle to extinction. That is, the hypercycle
is unstable against the invasion of ‘parasites’ (see also [21,22]). The situation is actually even worse: if one takes into account the fact that replication consumes
a finite amount of time, it can be shown that sequences providing catalysis are at a selective
disadvantage rather than being selectively neutral [23]. Thus, selection favours better templates,
but acts against better catalysts. The pioneering work of Eigen and Schuster, combined with the fundamental issue raised by
Maynard Smith, has set a specific agenda for research on the origin of life: assume a system of
replicating molecules that compete and interact with each other, and investigate what conditions
are required for the system to have a potential to evolve into life as we know it.
