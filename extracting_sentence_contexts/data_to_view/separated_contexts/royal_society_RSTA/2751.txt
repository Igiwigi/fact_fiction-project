When trained on vast datasets that include both personal data 2S
and sensitive personal data, these systems will essentially imbibe, embed and amplify biases 3
and discrimination. Even in the case where sensitive attributes such as caste, religion, political : 8S
leanings, sexuality are subject to forced blindness altogether, proxies still exist and additionally, .
as Barocas et al. explain, ‘several slightly correlated features can be used to build high accuracy
classifiers for the sensitive attribute’ [60]. The Bill does not address surveillance concerns that currently plague India’s legal framework,
and in fact remains completely silent on the question of accountability and transparency in
intelligence agencies. The privacy implications of AI applications are thus systemically poised
to be adverse in some senses: on one hand, the legal framework contemplates unrestricted State
processing of both sensitive personal data and personal data, and at the same time, the State is
rolling out Al applications that carry out surveillance and profiling, effectively granting them free
rein in this regard.

(ii) Freedom of expression

Freedom of speech and expression is a fundamental right under Indian constitutional law.* The
Supreme Court of India has repeatedly relied on it as an integral part of democracy, and has
also found that this freedom includes the right to know. Freedom of expression is profoundly
impacted by AI, given the increasing reliance on these systems for moderation of content online,
and increasing use of AI applications in everyday life, from smart assistants to autocorrect
technology on mobile devices [54].
