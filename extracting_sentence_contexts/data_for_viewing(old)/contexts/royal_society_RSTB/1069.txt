3 Very generally (as in all the other species) the line of separation of the protoplasm
Es and yolk is almost accurately transverse, as described or figured by Fixipr1, Minter
€ and Bucunorz, Hork, and Lana, for other Cirripedes. In. many cases, however, it
© lies at a small or considerable inclination to the longer axis of the ovum (fig. 10); we
7 may thus get, as Nusspaum has observed in Pollicipes, all transitions from a nearly
S longitudinal to a transverse plane, arising by simple variation, without it being at all
a necessary to assume, as NussBaum has done, a rotation of the plane. Nusspaum
& supposed that the plane of separation (his first cleavage plane) is parallel to the
longer axis of the ovum, and later, rotates and becomes transverse. I carefully
investigated the earlier stages from this point of view, and convinced myself that no
rotation whatever occurs. In the position of the polar bodies my evidence is at
variance with the statements of NusspAum, and the facts are, I think, conclusive in
favour of my own view. The polar bodies, it is admitted on all hands, are formed at
the anterior pole; if rotation occurs the polar bodies which adhere closely to the
protoplasm, must, as Nusspaum assumes, share in the movement, and in the case of
ova with oblique basal planes should show an obliquely situated polar body. Fig. 48

(Lepas pectinata) shows quite clearly that this is not the case ;* mostly, however,
the polar bodies become rapidly lost, and I think the bedies supposed by Nusspaum
to be polar bodies, and found by him in the furrow between the yolk and protoplasmic
half, cannot be such. J have also frequently seen cases when the wall was accurately
