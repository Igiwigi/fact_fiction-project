this is one of a system of 120 equations; viz.: referring to the foregoing table of the
120 pairs, it in fact appears that taking any pair such as 3,3, out of the upper com-
partment or the lower compartment of any column of the table, the corresponding
differential combination 9,d9,—4,04, is a linear function of any two of the four pairs
in the other compartment of the same column,

Differential relation of u, v and a, y.
