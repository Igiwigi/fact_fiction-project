under high dispersion, and their wave-lengths have only been obtained by interpolation,
I do not think that these possess the requisite degree of accuracy to be used again as
reference lines. It should be our endeavour to make our measurements as homogeneous
as possible, and as long as AxgsTRon's solar maps is the standard work for wave-length
measurements we should refer all our measurements to that map. Trarix has
adopted this plan in his excellent series of measurements, but the method which he
used presents serious difficulties when the light to be examined is weak.

I have used as reference lines the bright lines of such metals as are present in the
sun, the wave-lengths of which can therefore be directly found on AngsTROM's map.
The lines of iron are very useful in this respect.

The interpolation formula which is usnally employed is based on the fact that the
difference in refractive indices of two lines varies nearly as the difference between the
inverse squares of the wave-lengths. Tf reference lines can be found sufficiently close,
the formula does pretty well ; but I find that for the dispersion which I have ugsed,
the formula is no longer applicable when the distance between the reference lines is
about ten times the distance between the two sodium lines. As it is nob always
possible to find good reference lines within that distance, I have generally used three
reference lines, and taken the inverse fourth powers of the wave-lengths into account.
I am not quite certain that even then the errors of interpolation did not exceed, in 8ome
cages, slightly the errors of observation. The reason why the ordinary interpolation

. formula, cannot be used, does not lie 8&0 much in the fact that the law of the inverse
square does not hold accurately for refractive indices (although this, of course, is also
