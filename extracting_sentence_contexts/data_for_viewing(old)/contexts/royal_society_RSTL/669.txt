Since any error in the original estimate of this wire must per-
vade all subsequent measures derived from it, the substance
employed was pure gold drawn till fifty-two inches in length
weighed exactly five grains. If we assume the specific gravity
of gold to be 19,6, a cylindrical inch will weigh g837 grains,
and we may thence infer the diameter of such a wire to be +;
of an inch, more nearly than can be ascertained by any other
method. For the sake of rendering the scale more accurate,
a similar method was in fact pursued with several gold wires,
of different sizes, weighed with equal care ; and the subdivi-

of 16,6 inches, and hence one division ==

$ions of the exterior scale were made to correspond with the
average of their indications.

In making use of this micrometer for taking the measure
of any object, it would be sufficient at any one accidental posi-
tion of the tube to note the number on the outside as deno-
minator, and to observe the number of divisions and decimal
parts which the subject of examination occupies, on the interior
