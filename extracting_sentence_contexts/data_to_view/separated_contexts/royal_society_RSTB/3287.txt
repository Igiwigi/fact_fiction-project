Srrawan’s paper, fig. 1, Plate 12,
show innumerable centres of concretionary action. In the rock of this type very
little or no plant tissue is recognisable, but in some parts thin streaks of coaly matter
are seen to run between the concretions. The theoretical conclusion come to by SrRAHAN from the facts he described is that
the dolomite “ tufa” beds replacing the coal must have been deposited in water in
which the coal seam was also being deposited, but that locally the water must have
been so free from clastic material that even plant débris was of rare occurrence ;

thus the dolomite was deposited in a pure condition, and free from plant remains. His argument, however, does not seem to us conclusive when one considers the
difficulty of imagining such locally pure regions in a place otherwise filled by plant

* It may be noted that here dolomite replaces the coal, while the coal balls are spoken of as calcareous. In reference to our Section IV it will be seen that the analyses we give there show that the coal balls are
frequently formed very largely of dolomite.
