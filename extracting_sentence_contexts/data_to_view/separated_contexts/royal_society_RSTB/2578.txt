chyme (en.). growth-lamelle in which the fibres are parallel with one another. Usually the
“echinulation” of Turbenaria is laminate in form, and one can often distinguish that
the lamina is composed of two or three striz, and repeating, in fact, the septal
structure. Fig. 574 is a transverse section through the eenenchyme between adjacent
caleyces ; the trabeculew are met in all possible directions.
