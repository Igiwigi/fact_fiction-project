In the meanwhile, numerical modelling has
progressed towards more sophisticated descriptions of structural components, mechanical and
electrical subsystems of modern offshore wind turbines, along with an appropriate treatment
of the incident wind and wave fields. Existing numerical models rely on modal representation,
multi-body, finite-element (FE) concepts, sometimes combined in mixed approaches, and involve
system motion equations to be solved by fully coupled nonlinear time-domain integration, to
account for inherent interactions between aerodynamic and hydrodynamic responses. In fact,
while aerodynamic loads on the rotor are to be derived from aeroelastic models, considering


the complex interaction between air flow and rotor blades, the influence of control systems
and support structure dynamics, the latter affects the calculation of the hydrodynamic loads. Hence, although in some cases and especially in the early stages of design, simplified analyses
are implemented with responses to wind and wave loads computed separately and next
superposed [18,19], only fully integrated time-domain simulations are currently recommended as
the basis of final, detailed wind turbine design calculations, owing to the role played by system
nonlinearities inherent to rotor aerodynamics, hydrodynamics and control systems [20-22]. For either existing solutions in shallow-transitional waters or future projects in deeper waters,
the objective of an efficient and cost-effective design poses engineering challenges and numerical
modelling complexities, which can be solved only by an integrated approach combining the
expertise in diverse fields such as, among others, aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, structural and
foundation engineering; also, vibration control and health monitoring play an important role, in
view of ensuring a reliable and continuous power production for sustainable investments [23,24]. =
Although an exhaustive description of all aspects of offshore wind turbines design is almost :
prohibitive, this theme issue will attempt to provide a broad perspective on the state of the art
and most recent developments, with 16 papers on aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, new design nee)
solutions, experimental tests on prototypes, response to environmental loads, vibration control
and health monitoring techniques.
