Here
‘again facts lend no countenance to the assertion that the collection of fibres in
Bach motor root represents one highly co-ordinate functional synergy. On the
‘Sontrary they indicate that not the whole motor root, but particular fractional
~tombinations of several motor roots are, in spinal reflex actions, to be considered
Anits. The afferent channels of the cord treat the pluri-segmental motor stations
Sr nuclei of these limb muscles as entities of homogeneous structure, as in fact

Physiological units.

3 From the foregoing it follows naturally that the reflex centrifugal discharge
of the spinal cord is pluri-segmental, The rule may be stated thus: in response to
Beeitation even approximately minimal of a single afferent root, or even of a single
sig of a single afferent root, the spinal discharge of centrifugal impulses evoked,
mds to occur vit more than one efferent root, i.e., is pluri-segmental. It is
interesting to note that this is more strongly the case in the limbs than in the
thoracic region where the segments are less commingled. The segmental arrange-
ment of the motor cells of the spinal cord is said by Scuwapet to be more obvious
in the thoracic than in the limb regions.
