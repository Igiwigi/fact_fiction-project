roason to think that many disturbing causes are, if not eliminated, at least reduced
to a minimum in this series of alloys. It will be possible up to a certain point to
apportion the effect of these disturbing causes, and eventually to set aside such
complications as tend to conceal the effect of atomic volume in the researches to
which reference has been made.

With the exception of some facts stated by Brnrens, and of some early experi-
ments of our own, on the alloys of gold and aluminium, to which we have just
referred, Professor ARNOLD was the first to examine the alloys of gold. He took
the experiments of one of us on the influence of impurities on the mechanical
properties of gold as the basis of his work,* and made some careful drawings of
etched sections of pure gold alloyed with about 0°2 per cent. of various impurities.
We consider, however, that photographs, of micro-sections are far preferable to
drawings, and we agree with M. Cuarpy,t in thinking that drawings, however careful,
give a very incomplete idea of the appearance of etched metallic surfaces. We have
therefore great pleasure in submitting to the Society micro-photographs from the
identical specimens of gold described by one of us in 1888, which formed the starting
point for the later investigations. The results of the micrographic examination of these
specimens of gold forms the first part of the present paper.
