The results of WERTHEIM, on the transmission of sonnd in timber, proved the velocity
to be greatest in a direction longitudinal to the fibres and annual rings of wood; less in
a direction perpendicular to the same, and from the centre of the tree radially towards
its exterior; and least of all in a direction, quam proz., parallel to the annual rings, and
perpendicular to the longitudinal fibres; that is to say, that in each case the velocity of
sound was rapid in proportion to the less compressibility of the wood in the same direc-
tion. His results might seem at first to conflict with those which I have announced.
Any such conclusion, however, would be a mistake; on the contrary, my results per-
fectly analogize with those above alluded to. The difference between the cases is, that -
wood in mass, however large, is practically homogeneous and unshattered, and that its
direction of least compressibility is longitudinal to its lamine (or annual rings); whereas
the direction of least compressibility of rock is transverse to its lamina (which have been
already powerfully compressed in this direction). In fact, as respects the point here in
question, there is no true analogy in sructure between the lamination (by annual rings)
of wood, and the lamination or bedding of rock.

It follows from what precedes, that earthquakes and rocks as both actually occur in
nature—the rocks being of a stratified or laminated form (generally all sedimentary
rocks)—must present the following conditions as to rate of transit of shock —

1s8t. If such rocks were perfectly unshattered, and the beds or laminz in absolute

contact, the shock would be transmitted more rapidly across these than in their own
direction.
