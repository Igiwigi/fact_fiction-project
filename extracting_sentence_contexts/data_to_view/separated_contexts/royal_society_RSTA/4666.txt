3 and 4), in each case, which is screwed down on the top of the thick
fine-adjustment plane, n; the mounting is effected in a manner which permits of
adjustment of the optical axis of the microscope precisely to the vertical position, at
right angles to the horizontal axis of the fine-movement screw which causes the
traverse of the microscope. The counterpoise is a cylindrical leaden weight, m, and
m,, adjusted on an arm projecting from the back of the bracket as much as the
microscope projects in front. When they are approached as near as possible to each
other, the optical axes of the two microscopes are slightly under 4 inches apart, just
adequate, in fact, to enable the end marks on a decimetre bar to be respectively

focussed by the two microscopes, and a 4-inch bar still more readily. The coarse
adjustment is by rack and pinion, moving a very long dovetail slide, 7, which is
attached directly to the tube. This can be readily clamped by the milled-headed
screw, v, when set to the approximate focus, so that no motion can take place at this
slide.
