luminous longer than the air lines, and that the metallic particles are projected with a

centre of the spark ; its appearance, which in some of the photographs taken is even
more marked than here, is illustrated in fig. 11. We must conclude that the air
remains luminous in the centre of the spark rather longer than near the poles. This
fact, which is very apparent for the luminosity of the metallic vapours, will be
referred to again further on (p. 210).

our results we give in the first columns the coordinates of the curved lines which
