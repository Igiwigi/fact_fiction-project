We have tried from time to time to obtain some measures of the electrical thick-
= of films formed of a solution containing 3 per cent. KNOs, at thicknesses inter-
ediate between that corresponding to the black and 200 p.p. Such observations
Gould be very valuable in helping us to decide whether there is.or is not a real
Saximum of specific conductivity at about 100 p.n., which is suggested by the fact
fiat (in spite of the discrepancies above noted) the ratio of the electrical to the
Gtical thickness is less for thick films and for black films than for those whose
thicknesses lie between 200 py.p., and 400 py. Unfortunately, though we have
Ethausted every device known to us, sometimes leaving the film to thin unaided,
Bmetimes passing weak and sometimes strong currents through it, we have never
Sicceeded in getting the white of the first order. This connecting link cannot, there-
re, be at present supplied, but the facts are sufficient to justify the proposition that
increase in specific conductivity observed in the case of an unsalted solution is
largely diminished by the addition of a salt. It is indeed open to question whether
the evidence would not support the statement that there is no appreciable change in the
Specific conductivity of a film containing 3 per cent. of salt, but although we hardly feel
justified in drawing this general conclusion, there can be no doubt whatever that
it is true for a liquide glycérique for the black on the one hand, and for thicknesses
greater than 374 .u. on the other, and therefore, in all probability (though not quite
eertainly) for intermediate thicknesses. This conclusion rests upon our previous
work. In 1881 we proved that there is no change in the specific resistance of a film
of salted liquide glycérique down to a thickness of 374 p.. (‘ Phil. Trans., Part 2,
1881, p. 447, et seq.) while the optical and electrical thicknesses of black films are 10°7
