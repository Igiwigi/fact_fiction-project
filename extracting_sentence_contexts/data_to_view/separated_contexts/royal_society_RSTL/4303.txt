In addition to the galvano-
meters, the wet and dry thermometers were also noted at every observation. The results of these observations are given in diagram No. 1, and allowing for the
difference in delicacy of the two galvanometers, there is enough to show that the
currents were simultaneous in all their changes; it was also evident from this experi-
ment that the direction of the current was the same at both extremities of the wire. This fact, together with those previously mentioned, indicates that the currents
which produce deflections do not arise from the transit of electricity between the
atmosphere and the earth, but that from whatever cause the currents originate, they
