This is primarily true for n greater than 7, but, by
a suitable choice of v, it is evidently valid for all values of 7. * Previous investigators seem to have overlooked the fact that the yalue of m is not obvious, They
have all tacitly assumed m = 0,

§ 6. It follows from (8) and (15) that the large singular values of «(s,t) may be
calculated from the asymptotic formula

We proceed to obtain an asymptotic formula for w,4,(s), the normal function
corresponding to Aj,41. Let uv, denote the function which u (§ 1) becomes when 7, is substituted for 7; then,
from the definition of 7,, it is clear that u, satisfies the pair of boundary conditions B’.
