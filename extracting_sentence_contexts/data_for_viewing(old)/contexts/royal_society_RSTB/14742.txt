Since the eyes typically move three times a second, it’s
suggested that to make the world seem stable, a perceptual
mechanism is required to cancel out the motion of the
world on the retina caused by eye movements [159-161].
‘Clearly, extraretinal signals are important for visual stability’
[162]. However, if, as I argue, vision remains in retinotopic
terms, then the mechanisms underpinning visual stability
must be merely cognitive (post-perceptual) in nature [27,
p. 6] since they can’t operate at the level of our visual
experience, which remains retinotopic.

Supporting this hypothesis is the fact that the perceptual
mechanism commonly suggested for visual stability is
simply too slow. In [151] an after-image was induced, and par-
ticipants were then asked to move their eyes in darkness.
Participants reported seeing the after-image move, even
though the retinal image remained fixed, which was inter-
preted to be an indication of a perceptual translation from
retinal to head-centric coordinates [151]. However, the
reported shift in direction occurred 0.6-0.8s after the eye
movements had been made, which is much too slow to be of
use for visual stability when 3+ eye movements are made
every second.
