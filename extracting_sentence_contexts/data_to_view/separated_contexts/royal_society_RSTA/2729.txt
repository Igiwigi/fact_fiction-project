If the above general idea is accepted, there will be two extremes in this kind of
equilibrium. Where the atomic size factors are markedly unfavourable, the atomic
factor is predominant, and the classical methods may be applied as in the work of
Jererery. At the other extreme, when the atomic size factors are favourable, and the
solvent and solute are in the same period, the equilibrium is essentially electronic and
ionic, and the classical equations require modification* to allow for the fact that the
electrons form a degenerate system. In between these extremes are systems such as
copper-tin and silver-gallium, where the size factors are near the critical limit,
and the whole position becomes more confused. The fact that in these and
other systems the experimental work leads to the conception of liquidus and solidus
factors which are whole numbers suggests clearly that there is some kind of electronic
quantum equilibrium.
