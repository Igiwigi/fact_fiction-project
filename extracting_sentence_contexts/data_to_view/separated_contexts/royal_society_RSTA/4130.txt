The electrostatic effect apart, the Helmholtz view assumes
that the nature of the transition from the solution to the mereury is (through a con-
siderable range) independent of the potential difference and of the nature of the
solution. Several published observations show that there are cases for which this assumption
cannot be true. There are many facts in favour of the view that for a given -
potential difference there is a corresponding condition (of the partly physical, partly
chemical kind, pictured by Warsure) of the space bounded on the one side by the
mercury, and on the other by the sensibly homogeneous solution. Obviously the
surface tension will depend upon the nature of the transition through the surface
layer. The mode of transition may depend only on the chemical nature of the
solution and the potential difference across the space in which the transition takes
place.
