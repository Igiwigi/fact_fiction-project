If we assume that v may be expanded in ascending powers of
x, y, we may put

v=3(—1p “(ap ts, +25),

where u=f(& 7, ¢). The foregoing reasoning then shows that the coefficient of
H,? («,, #, 2), when we transform v into sphere coordinates, will be

(—1)"=h," (m, 2, ),

in which the = means that every possible integral value of m is to be taken from
0 upwards. In fact, if we put

' pt
u =(i +xan05+ #21 (n+ 5) Qn +3) + é a0

the coefficient of H,? (2, y;, 2,) will become

found for f (€— a, » — y, €— 2) will hold, not only at the surface of the ellipsoid,
but at all points in its interior, and is, moreover, capable of simplification ; for in
that case
