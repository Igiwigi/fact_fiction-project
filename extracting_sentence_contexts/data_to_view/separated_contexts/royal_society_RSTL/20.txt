' are weigh'd, exaCtly of the ſame weight; yet they are nothing

equiponderant; but if the Wan be heavier, the greater
Body, as being lighter in Specte, will-looſe more of its weight, _*
than the lefſer and more compact; but if the new Medium be
lighter than the firſt, then the bigger Body will outweigh the

be all one, as to the effect to be produced, whether the Bo-
dies were weighed in Medzzm's of differing gravity, or in the
ſame Medium, in cafe its ( /pecifick) gravity were conſiderably
alrer'd; And conſequently, that fince it appear'd by the Ba-
ro/cope, that the weight of the Air was ſometimes heavier, and ]
ſometimes lighter, the alterations of it, in point of gravity,
from the weight, it was off at firſt counterpoiſing of the Buble
of it, would wnequally affe&t ſo large and hollow a Body,as the
Buble, and ſo ſmall and denſe a one, as a Metallin weight: And
when the Air by an increaſe of gravity ſhould become a heavier |
Medium, than before, it would buoy up the Glaſs more than
the Counterpoiſe; and if it grew lighter, than-it was at firſt,
would ſuffer the former to preponderate : ( The Illuſtrations
and Proof can ſcarce be added in few words ; but, if it be de-
fired, Imay, God permitting, ſend you them at my next lea-
ſure: ) And though our Engliſh Air be about a thouſand times
lighter, than water, the difference in weight of ſo little Air,-as
khak equal in bulk to a Buble, ſeem'd to give ſmall hopes, that
it would be ſenſible upon a Ballance; yet, by making the Buble *
very large and light, I ſuppoſed and found the Event, Lhave
already related. :
