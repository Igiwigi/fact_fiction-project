& The life-cycle of the ameloblasts in Marsupials may be divided into 14 stages, of
8 which the latter nine, coinciding with the elaboration and secretion of the enamel-
‘s forming substance, represent the active functional period in the life of the cell, and
2 the more marked morphological changes passed through in these stages will be

a It is with these later stages that this paper is mainly concerned and the earlier

5 stages, those passed through from the first inflection of the dental lamina to a period
~ just previous to functional activity, are not dealt with here, for they throw no light
3 on the subject of this paper. They are, however, important in view of the fact that
eI the interpretation of Marsupial dentition involves the identification of tooth-germs
8 which do not proceed to calcification. Differentiation in the cell affords a means of
indentification of great value when endeavouring to interpret such admittedly
unsatisfactory evidence as the aggregation of cells to form “buds.” Through the
further kindness of Prof. Hin, I have undertaken an investigation into this obscure
field with the hope that the employment of cytological criteria may throw some light
on a subject the solution of which would be of such value to zoology.

Immediately before the appearance of a thin layer of dentine on the surface of the
tooth pulp, the ameloblasts are seen to constitute a layer of cells continuous over the |
