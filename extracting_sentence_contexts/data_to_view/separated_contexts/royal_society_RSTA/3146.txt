Regions of in/stability and existence for stripes in a system with homogeneous parameter and for half-stripes with a
jump-type inhomogeneity; leading-order asymptotics (dashed) and directly computed data (solid). See text for details. (Online
version in colour.)

— half-stripes exist with inhomogeneity and are zigzag unstable, full stripes exist with
previous stability
(Inhom. ex., ZZ unst.)
— half-stripes exist and are stable, full stripes exist and are stable
(Inhom. ex., ZZ stab.)
— no half-stripes exist, full stripes exist and are stable
(Inhom. non-ex., Hom. ex., Eck. stab.)
— stripes exist and are Eckhaus unstable, no half-stripes exist
(Hom. ex., Eck. unst.)
— no stripes exist (Non-ex.). Note that half-stripes selected by the jump-type inhomogeneity have wavenumbers that are
bounded away from the Eckhaus instability, but overlap significantly with the zigzag-unstable
region.


(c) Growing domains and zigzag selection

The fact that the minimum selected wavenumber kmin is zigzag unstable has dramatic
consequences for pattern selection. However, the effects are not immediately visible in
simulations because the system does not select a unique wavenumber. In particular, we would
need to impose a phase condition 6 ~ 1/2 to select kmin.
