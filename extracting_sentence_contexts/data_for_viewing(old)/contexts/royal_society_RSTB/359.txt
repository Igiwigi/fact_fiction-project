although this property does not serve to distinguish it from the other organisms which
accompanied it until the final separation by the process of dilution was accomplished.

(3) On microscopical examination, the solutions nitvified by the pure culture
exhibited numerous small bacillar forms, which stain with somewhat more difficulty
than most micro-organisms. The bacilli are about 0°8y in length, and hardly longer
than broad, in fact, their form is intermediate hetween that of a bacillus and micro-
coceus, so that the term “ bacillococcus ” may not inappropriately be used to designate
them. They occur both isolated, in pairs, and in small irregular groups.

The accompanying figure exhibits their appearance as taken from bottle No, 1
itself.

Thus their appearance, although not so characteristic as to admit of their ready
detection when present in small numbers along with other organisms, is still
sufficiently definite to enable them to be distinguished from many other forms.

The organisms in the living state exhibit vibratory movement only.
