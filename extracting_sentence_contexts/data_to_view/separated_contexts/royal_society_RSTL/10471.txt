As 80on as this conception. of heat and electricity was
Sreached mathematicians began to apply to them the dynamical method of the Con-

E other, and others predicted by the use of this principle ; thus, to take an example, the
| noon of electric currents by a moving magnet was shown by von HELMmorTz to
S be a necessary consequence of the fact that an electric current produces a magnetic
S field. Of late years things have been carried still further ; thus Sir WiLan
"Z TroMs0N in many of his later papers, and especially in his address to the British

; a good deal of attention to the description of machines capable of producing effects

plane of polarisation of light by quartz and other crystals. For these reasons the view
& (which we owe to the principle of the Conservation of Energy) that every physical
amenca admits of a dynamical explanation is one that will hardly be questioned
at the present time.
