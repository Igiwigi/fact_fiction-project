If no forces act, if we multiply the equations of motion respectively by
@1, ®g, . . . wg, and add, we geb by integration

Aw*+Bouy?+Coug?+Fof+Go?+Huf=2T

which is the equation of conservation of energy. If again we multiply the equations of motion by Aw;, Bus, - . . , and add, we arrive
at another integral of the equations,

A%o;*+ B*og+O%,+ Foul+ 0%, +H%uf=K?,
which expresses the fact that the 8um of the 8quares of the 9's is constant. One more integral may easily be found. For let

A=ma?, 1 B=mb?, ....
then
f*=1=—a?
