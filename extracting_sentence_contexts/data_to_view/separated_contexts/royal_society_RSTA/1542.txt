Using the fact that 4 (y) — J, (y)/\/y
satisfies the homogeneous equation with coeflicient x, we obtain

This equation arises in any attempt to find a suitable solution, and we shall call it the
cardinal equation. It is required to find an even solution Q (x), not necessarily—nor
in fact—expressible as a convergent series of power of z. The equation admits, indeed,
an infinite number of purely odd, purely even, or mixed solutions, and must be com-
bined with other conditions involved in the problem to obtain a unique suitable one—
and especially combined with the original equation, which is more general. §16.
