disparity of size is most striking, it will be seen at once that it is, if I may say so,
absurd to imagine that a process of “ copulation”! is taking place between the fully
developed adult organism, on the one hand, and the tiny and very elementarily
developed individual which is adherent to its aperture in this specimen. Whilst the
adult (I allow myself this term and also the term “juvenile” for purposes of
definition and demonstration) possesses the full complement of chamberlets which
is normal to the species, the juvenile cannot by any means be discovered to consist

&  chamber.2 From this point the figures (which, like all other figures illustrating
8 this paper, are drawn from actual specimens and photographs) show a gradual
