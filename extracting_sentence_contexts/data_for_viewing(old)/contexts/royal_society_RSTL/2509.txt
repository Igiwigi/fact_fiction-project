gentleman has erred in his dissections of the immature Lobster, and mistaken the
lateral appendage of the outer foot-jaw for a Schizopodous appendage of the Cheli-

Fourthly, As respects the explanation or © excuse” which this principle of meta-
morphosis enables us to give for the annual migrations of the land Crabs of the
West Indies to the ocean to deposit their spawn, the young produced from which
being natatory animals—Zoes, in fact,—are incapable of living in the same element
as their parents in their early stages, I can very well agree with Mr. Taomeson that,

very circumstance could be adduced of the universality of metamorphosis, in as much
