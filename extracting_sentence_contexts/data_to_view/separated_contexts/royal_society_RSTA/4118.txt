This would have been due to the
action difference showing up as an exponentiated phase. It would also seem to be limited to
logarithmically short time scales. Instead, the manifold stability is strong enough to eliminate
the exponential sensitivity completely, and, in fact, the first-order classical perturbation term

is valid on algebraically long time scales. It is responsible, after further argumentation, for : 2
introducing the classical action diffusion constant. There has been discussion of hypersensitivity : =
to perturbations [56,57] for quantum chaotic systems, but the context is different than that being : ยง
discussed here. boy

A nice illustration of the accuracy of perturbation theory is given in [16]; a modified version : <
of their fig. 3 is shown as figure 7.
