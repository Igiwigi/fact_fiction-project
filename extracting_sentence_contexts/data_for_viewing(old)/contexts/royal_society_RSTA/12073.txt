The temperature of the room being about 15° C. = 288° absolute, then R = 0,
T = 'T, = 288°, will give a point both on the experimental and the calculated curves.

ON THE EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE OF THE SUN. 375

It will be noticed at once that at comparatively low temperatures the curve does
not accurately express the facts, but that the agreement is very good as the tempera-
ture rises. This disagreement has been confirmed by Litconrr Stevens, whose paper*
came under our notice after our experiments were finished and the curve drawn.
He concludes that, at comparatively low temperatures, the fourth power law gives too
rapid a rate of increase of radiation, which agrees with our observations, but that as
the temperature rises this divergence diminishes.

The following table gives the results of the three series of observations, which are
also plotted on the curve, fig. 6; in two cases, the difference between the observed
and calculated results is so large that some misreading seems likely, otherwise the
agreement is very satisfactory :—
