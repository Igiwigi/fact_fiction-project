406 Dk. A. P. CHATTOCK ON THE PHYSICS OF INCUBATION,

In addition to being much increased, the effect of turning the eggs 48 times a day
was in the opposite direction to that of turning them five times, the slight gain in
hatching percentage due to the latter having thus changed to a considerable loss, It
looked, in fact, as if the turning had been overdone.

To see whether the change was gradual the clock was next set for eight turnings a day
(Table IV., 5), with the rather unexpected result that the loss was about the same as
before—unexpected, because eight is so much nearer to five than to 48 that a tendency
to pass from loss to gain might well have shown itself.

The fact that the eight turns were made by motor and the five by hand suggested
that the explanation probably lay in some essential difference between motor and hand
turning as such. Now the motor turning was smooth and gradual, while that by hand
(normal) was relatively quick and jerky. A test was therefore arranged in which all
the eggs were turned by hand, but half of them jerkily as in “ normal” turning and
the rest slowly, as if by motor. The results are given in Table IV., 6. They are the
