neuro-muscular independence for it, another point in which it resembles not only the
body but parts of the body of a ccelenterate (PARKER, 1919). These resemblances are
probably more than superficial and point to a constitutional likeness in organisation
that, if not inherited, is at least inherent in such systems.

The female generative ducts in the tortoise, the pigeon, and the rabbit are provided
with a continuous musculature. The activity of this musculature near the external
ends of the ducts appears to be the normal first step in the transfer by the female of the
spermatic fluid from the region of deposition by the male to a point higher in the ducts.
It involves ordinarily only the lower parts of these structures and is the muscular
component of the female sexual orgasm. It may spread, however, presumably
as waves of antiperistalsis, up the ducts even to their ovarian ends. This, at least,
is the conclusion that I draw from the fact that at copulation rat sperms pass
from the vagina of this animal to the apex of its uterine horn in less than two
minutes (HARTMAN and Batt, 1930) and that fully formed eggs in the hen may
be discharged through the infundibulum into the birdâ€™s abdominal cavity (PEARL and
Curtis, 1914).

These ducts also exhibit typical peristalsis, in that waves course over them from their
deep ends next the ovaries outward to the exterior. Such waves are the obvious means
of moving large eggs like those of the tortoise and of the pigeon through the length
of the ducts. In the pigeon the egg traverses approximately thirty-five centimetres of
tube in a little Jess than twenty-four hours. In the pigeon, and especially in the tortoise,
the peristaltic activity of the duct is broken into two rather distinct periods. The
first is marked by the action of the upper portion of the duct, during which the egg
