Social scientists posit that such
‘pluralistic ignorance’ has maintained suboptimal norms and
institutions including drinking behaviour on US college cam-
puses [153] and restricted female labour force participation in
Saudi Arabia [154].

5. Conclusion

Explanations for the existence, accumulation and design of
cultural traditions benefit from a perspective that is both
broad and deep, that both considers interactions among a
web of factors and clarifies their contributions by probing
their deeper workings. Not only does such a perspective
reveal that a more diverse set of factors shapes culture, but
it also suggests that explanations currently regarded as
alternatives are, in fact, complimentary. We reviewed potential factors at the neural, cognitive-
behavioural and populational levels. But other levels are
relevant too, including the genetic, epigenetic and inter-popu-
lational levels.
