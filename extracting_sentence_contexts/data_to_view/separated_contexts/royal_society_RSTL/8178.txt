In structure Peripatus is more like Seolopendra than Julus,
viz. in the many joints to the antenne (Chilognaths having never more than fourteen), in
the form of the spermatozoa, and in being viviparous, as are some Scolopendras; in the
position of the orifices of the generative glands, and in the less perfect concentration
mesially in Scolopendra of the nerve-cords. Peripatus thus shows affinities in some
points to all the main branches of the family tree of Tracheata; but a gulf is fixed
between it and them by the divarication of the nerve-cords, and borne out s0mewhat
by such facts as the non-striation of the muscles, great power of extension of the body,
arrangement of the digestive tract in the early stage, persistence of metamorphosis, and
in the parts of their mouth, the full history of the manner of origin of these being
reseryed,

Speculations as to the mode of origin of the trachee themselves in the Tracheata
are many. Prof, Hagcker * follows GEGENBAUR, whose opinion is expressed in his
