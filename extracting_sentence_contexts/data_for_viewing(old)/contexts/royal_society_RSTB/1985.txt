& The ordinary type of gametophytic budding occurred in every culture and calls
Hor no special notice except, perhaps, as to the situations in which the flat or
¥ilamentous prothalli develop. Besides arising from the margin, they were frequently
resent on a thickening of the apex ; they also occurred on the under surface of the
cn. or the thin wing-like portions of the prothallus, and in some cases from
Aarchegonial projections. They were only rarely found to proceed from the necks of
archegonia. In many cases, notably in the cultures of Aspidiwm aculeatum and
Athyrium niponicum, Gorre.’s* view that ,the gametophytic budding was due to
“the weakening of the prothallus ” by the influence of unfavourable conditions meets
the facts. In such cases this was the common or almost exclusive form which the
new growths assumed. In other cases, while gametophytic budding was common,
the new growths from corresponding positions tended to assume the characters
of the sporophyte. This was most common in well nourished prothalli.
While there is no reason to consider the cylindrical process as anything but a
