So- that it is evident, that the several
portions-of one and the-same line, seen through the intervals
of the bars, form on the retina the images of -«o many dif-
ferent radii. The true principle, then, on which this phenomenon de-
pends, is the same as that to which is referable the illusion
that occurs when a bright object is wheeled rapidly round in
a_ circle, giving rise to -the appearance of a line of light
throughout the whole, circumference: namely, that an im-
pression made by a pencil of rays on the retina, if sufficiently
vivid, will remain for a certain time after the cause has
ceased. Many analogous facts have been observed with
regard to the other senses, which, as they are well known,
it is needless here to particularize. In order to trace more distinctly'the operation of this prin-
ciple in the present case, it will be best to take the pheno-
menon in its simplest 'form, as resulting from the view of a
single radius, (fig. 2.) OR of the wheel VW, revolving steadily
upon its axis, but without any progressive motion, and seen
