Difference map between the models of the photoexcited and dark
structures of PYP assumed in the calculations. The difference between the
two structures is that the chromophore (HC4 300) undergoes a cis — trans iso-
merization which causes it to swing outward towards the edge of the
molecule, whereas the ARG 52 residue also swings outwards to make
room for the new position of the chromophore in the photoexcited structure. Note that the red lobes of negative electron density are associated with pos-
itions of these residues (or functional groups) in the dark structure (yellow
bonds) and the green regions of positive difference electron density with
their positions (purple bonds) in the excited structure (although the red
lobe on the original position of ARG 52 is somewhat cancelled by the fact
that it lies between the green lobes of ARG 52 and the chromophore.

concentrated to 150mgml™' or higher (M. Schmidt 2011,
unpublished data), that is about 10 mmol 1"! or higher. In the
following, we propose using a concentration of just one-fifth
of this amount, namely about 2 mmol 1~!.
