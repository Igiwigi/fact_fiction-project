In both models, the first equation describes the ice mass response to changes
in CO, (u) and the astronomical forcing (F;(t)); Saltzman adopts the so-called
Milankovitch view? that an increase in insolation causes a decrease in ice mass.
Increases in CO, or in ocean temperature have the same effects.

The other two equations describe the dynamics of CO2 and the response
of deep-ocean temperature to changes in ice volume. It is further assumed
that the mean state of the climate varied slowly throughout the Pliocene
Pleistocene; in particular, in response to a ‘tectonically driven’ decline in the

?In fact, the view is introduced by Murphy [48] but it is developed mathematically in the ‘canon
of insolation’ authored by Milankovitch [4].
