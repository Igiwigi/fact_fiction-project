cucumbers, the ambulacral feet are still the most important organs of locomotion,
although even here we begin to see that the development of the general muscular
system has begun to tell upon that of these specially locomotor organs. Again, in
Asxtropecten the till greater development of the general muscular system has told
still further upon that of the ambulacral feet, the terminal snekers having become
aborted. Lastly, the Brittle-stars have altogether discarded the use of their ambu-
lacral feet in favour of the much more efficient organs of locomotion 8upplied by their
muscular rays ; and not only the terminal suckers of these feet, but even the whole of
the feet themselves, have dwindled into useless rudiments.

$ IT. STIMULATION.

1. GENERAL FACTS OF STIMULATION.â€”All the Echinoderms we have observed
respond to all kinds of stimulation, The period of latency varies considerably in
different species, and in different parts of the same animal, In the Holothurians it is
remarkably long, and from the seat of stimulation there very frequently starts a wave
of strong contraction, which passes with extreme slowness throughout the length of
the animal in the form of a deep constrietion. Similar waves frequently ocenr
spontaneously.

All the Echinoderms seek to escape from injury. Thus, for instance, if a Star-figh
or Echinus is advancing continuously in one direction, and if it be pricked or cut in
any part of an excitable surface facing the direction of advance, the animal imme-
diately reverses that direction ; or, if it be taken out of the water and a drop of some
irritating fluid be placed on any part of the external surface, the animal will endeavour
