passed through the barytic water ; but its transparency was not affected.



DR. STEVENS ON THE THEORY OF RESPIRATION. 347

From this experiment it is obvious that serum (consequently blood or other albu-
minous fluid,) may absorb carbonic acid, and $0 retain it as not to be separable by
the mere remoyal of the pressure of the air.

The air-pump has hitherto been used almost exclusively by the experimenters on
venous blood ; and those who deny the existence of carbonic acid in it, do 80 almost
entirely on such evidence. The fact of their not having thus obtained this gas is cor-
rect ; but there is an error in the conclusion drawn from it, which is the chief cause of
the difference of opinion on this subject ; for such experiments only afford a positive
proof that carbonic acid cannot always be obtained from blood placed under the ex-
hausted receiver of the air-pump : but, with respect to the existence or non-existence
of such acid in the blood, the proof is merely negatiye ; for in experiment 4. the pump
did not separate carbonic acid from seram previously impregnated with it : conse-
quently such experiments are inconclusive.

5, Carbonic acid was introduced into an empty bladder that had been previously
well moistened with warm water. When the bladder was distended about one third,
its neck was firmly tied with a waxed thread, by which it was suspended in the centre
of a receiver of an air-pump. When the pump was worked, the bladder increased in
