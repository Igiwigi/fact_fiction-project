This series terminates ifn*’ and n*” are integers, but in general is of the form of an asymptotic
expansion. It can, however, be evaluated with sufficient accuracy by ignoring terms for

which p +p" <1 nT. (19)f

The first omitted term is in fact unimportant, except when the sum of the others is passing
through a zero. The significance of condition (19) can perhaps most clearly be visualized by
noting that it corresponds to neglecting in the integrals of (17) powers of r less than 2. The
main contribution from these comes from the region close to the origin.
