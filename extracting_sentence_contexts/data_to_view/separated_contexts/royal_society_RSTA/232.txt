The second term is such that MN’ =0 for constant density and velocity, in which
case equation (3.3) still holds. This term may be constructed using fluid dynamical
analogies and usually contains a ‘pressure term’ that is proportional to —0,p/p
and represents anticipation of drivers to events ahead, and a ‘diffusion term’ that
is proportional to v,, and represents the averaged effects of noise (Payne 1979;
Kerner & Konhauser 1994). Despite the fact that pressure and diffusion are abstractions that are difficult to
interpret in traffic, these models are able to reproduce uniform flow as well as stop-
and-go waves (without discontinuities). However, they have been criticized for
predicting non-physical flow motions (negative flux and negative velocities) under
certain conditions (Daganzo 1995). In response to this criticism N = pP’(p)d,v
has been proposed by Aw & Rascle (2000), where the function P(p) represents
anticipation.
