gs, partly because the clock cannot be perfectly © in beat,” and partly because the
Yectrical connexion is guch as to make the length of the second, as, registered, depend
pon the direction of vibration of the pendulum.
E The © difference,” such as 2,411, in the column of the wheel record, is the number
divisions (or ten-thousandths of a revolution) passed over by the cylinder in the
course of 100 revolutions of the toothed wheel.
The © alternate difference,” such as 22,419 in the column of the clock record, is the
number of divisions passed over by the cylinder in the course of two geconds of time.
If the cylinder rotated with perfect uniformity the quotient of these bwo numbers,
viz,, 22412 =9-2986, would be the number of hundreds of revolutions completed by
the toothed wheel in two seconds of time, and if we multiply this number by 50, we
get 46493 revolutions per second as the speed of the toothed wheel.
But as a matter of fact the chronograph-cylinder is constantly accelerated by the
small weight, and retarded by the friction of the instrument. 'The total effect is
generally a retardation, gradually diminishing the velocity of rotation of the chrono-

between two wheel marks this retardation does not affect us. We can ay, in
above example, that the cylinder is passing over 0'2411 reyolution in 100 turns
the toothed wheel, ab the instant when the pen is ab the reading 1,437 ; and that it is
passing over 0'2404 revolution in 100 turns of the toothed wheel when the pen is at
the reading 5,046. A simple proportion tells us that when the pen is at the
