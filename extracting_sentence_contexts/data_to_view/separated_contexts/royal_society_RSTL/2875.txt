This is in reality the case ; and
Dr. Burnzis7rzR* has already imagined it to be 80, but he does not appear to have
made any obseryations of his own in order to prove it, but refers to the observations
before noticed by HausmaxxF. I remarked the fact during my earlier observations
on the temperature of insects in 1834, when endeayouring to ascertain the actual
amount of temperature in the common Humble Bee in a state of rest and in a state
of great excitement, and when endeavyouring also to ascertain whether the amount of
temperature in a single insect is equal to that of an indefinite number of individuals. T had long suspected that this could not be the case, and that, for instance, the tem-
perature of a hive of bees in winter, stated by Hue to be equal to 80” Faur., could
not be equal to that of a single individual at the same period. Previous observations
had induced me to believe that the temperature of a single insect is only a few degrees
above that of the medium in which it is living, and that the actual heat of the insect,
is increased in proportion to the amount of its respiration ; that when an insect. is at
rest its temperature is comparatively low, and that it becomes greatly increased during
violent activity; and further, that a number of individuals confined in a given space
can raise the temperature of that space to a great amount.
