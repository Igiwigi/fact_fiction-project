lying in a transparent medium,

Yet deeper these areas have become more disperse, are more or less pcbyiabals and
do not stain so deeply.

The areas (¢.7.) in question appear as the result of a change in the substance
occupying these alveoli, and the clear region about them is misleading, since it
suggests either that they lie in a fluid medium which has been dissolved, or that they
were originally in contact, but have undergone shrinkage, and drawn apart from one
another, to again swell a little farther within the forming enamel.

Actually this clear area is a definite structure, hyaline in nature, and its invisibility
is due to that fact that it does not stain readily, or rather destains very easily. This
may be demonstrated by using iron heematoxylin as a stain, when the whole area of
devoloping enamel stains very deeply, but in differentiation the matrix destains very
rapidly and completely, causing the areas (fig. 27, e.7.) to appear as though spaces
existed between them. By checking differentiation at the right moment, the matrix
(i.p.m.) may be demonstrated to be a continuous layer forming a honeycomb the walls
of which are more or less hexagonal (fig. 19), and in its cavities lie the more deeply
staining structures (¢.7.), which are identical with those seen in fig. 27.

The real nature of these areas is shown by comparing such sections shown in fig. 27
with fig. 28, which is a drawing of a section of developing enamel of Macropus
ruficollis showing the first organic coagulation constituting the fibril-forming layer
(ffl), the meshes of which are comparatively large when compared to the long
