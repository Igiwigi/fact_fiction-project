(6) The same applies to the Upper Lias but as it is two to three times as thick as the
Estuarine it is likely to extend somewhat farther.

(c) The Middle and Lower Lias (which cannot be separated in the bore-holes) are
500-600 ft. thick in Northamptonshire, thin southwards and are absent under London.
The thickness at Southery is unknown (112-+ft.).

(d) The Rhaetic and Trias are 50-120 ft. thick in Northamptonshire and presumably
disappear altogether a few miles to the east of the bores shown in figure 12. Only at
Corby does the seismic work suggest the presence of Trias.

These facts strongly suggest that the Lower Lias lies on the Palaeozoic over most of
the area between Northampton and Cambridge, and that over the eastern half of this
area it is succeeded by the Great Oolite limestone. The relations are illustrated diagram-

* Whatever may be the shortcomings of this bore (see above), it is highly probable that it nearly
reached the Palaeozoic.
