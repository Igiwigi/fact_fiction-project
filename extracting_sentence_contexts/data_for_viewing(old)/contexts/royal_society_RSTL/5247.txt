at an earlier stage of development, and formed a bond of union between them.
Everywhere about growing bone a careful examination will reveal cells attached to
its surface, while the surface of the bone itself will present a series of similar bodies
ossified (Plate IX. figs. 27, 28 and 29). To these we propose to give the name of
osteal cells, as distinguished from lacunal and other cells.

In microscopic characters the osteal cells closely resemble the granular cells of
temporary cartilage, s0 closely indeed, that the latter when detached from the car-
tilage could not well be distinguished from them. They are for the most part sphe-
rical or oval in form, and lie on the surface of the growing bone in a crowded mass,
held together by an intervening and apparently structureless matrix (Plate IX. fig.
27b). Here and there we find a cell which bas accumulated about itself an outer
investment of transparent tissue, and has in fact become developed into a lacunal
cell destined to become a lacuna*. These points are illustrated in fig. 29 6.

The process of growth may be thus described. In the meshes of the fibrous tissue

* The various views which have been entertained regarding the formation of the lacunze and canaliculi have
been concisely stated by Dr, Syareey, oper. cit. p. 158. He observes, that © they are generally suppoxsed to be
derived from the cells of the soft tissue involved in the ossification by some sort of metamorphosis which has
been variously conceived. Some suppose that the cells become the lacuna and send out branches (like the
pigment cells) to form the canaliculi (Scuwaxx'). Others think that it is not the cell but its nucleus that
undergoes this change, and that the substance of the nucleus is afterwards absorbed, leaving the lacuna (Topp
and Bownax?).” The nucleus described by Topp and Bowwax is identical with that which in this communi-
cation is called the granular cell, and from which the authors have shown the lacuna is formed. © Hexrz?
