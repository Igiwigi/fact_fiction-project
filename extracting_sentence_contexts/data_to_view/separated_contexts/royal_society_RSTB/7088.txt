In
the classical works on stelar morphology in ferns, the view has been advanced that the
solenostele is a stage in the progressive elaboration of the protostele (Bower 1923). That this
is so in the normal development is not in doubt. It is also held that the solenostele marks
an evolutionary advance on the prior, more primitive, protostelic condition, this being
borne out by the facts of ontogeny in solenostelic and dictyostelic ferns. A point of some
interest which has emerged from the present investigation is that in some of the large,
rapidly growing, induced buds, there is no protostelic stage, the vascular system being
solenostelic from the outset. 6. EFFECT OF PUNCTURING THE APICAL CELL
