As the oun is proportional to the square of the atomic weight within the limits of
error of determination of the latter, it is natural to assume that the relation is exact
and that d = g.w’, where q is a number between 361'°8+'1. If this were sustained it
would be possible to obtain w with twice the degree of accuracy of the oun and
therefore far in advance of any obtainable by chemical methods. In fact the question
is raised as to what is actually understood by the atomic weight. Does it refer to
the mass of the positive nucleus, or to that and all or a portion of the electrons ? The hope might even be entertained of obtaining by this method some knowledge of
the number of electrons partaking in the emission of a line if slight changes in the
oun could be found.
