the methods of positive science lose their hold upon the mind, until at length we are
actually informed by the consistent advocates of these ideas that the science of chemistry
has no other field for its activity than the obscure region of atomic speculations.

Now a symbolic calculus affords the same indispensable aid which is given by the
atomic theory, but in a more truthful and effectual way. In the place of molecules
and atoms it offers, as the subject of scientific contemplation, a system of marks and
combinations of letters, which, however, we are not free to arrange and to interpret
according to the dictates of caprice, but of which each has a specific meaning assigned
to it in the calculus, from which the laws are deduced according to which it is permitted
to operate upon it. We are thus enabled to construct an accurate symbolic representa-
tion of the phenomena before us, on the fidelity of which we can rely. Such a system
is indeed based, in the most absolute sense, upon fact, for it presents only two objects
to our consideration, the symbol and the thing signified by the symbo], the object of
thought and the object of sense; and it is not the least among the advantages which
such a method affords, that through it we are enabled to dispense altogether with less
truthful modes of representation, as no longer calculated to serve even a useful purpose.

Every mark or sign which we employ for the purposes of thought is in a certain

any interference with this method, which has already been subject to 80 many modifica-
tions, and which, moreover, satisfies certain real demands, I must confess also that it

seemed to me incapable of development, as being destitute of those essential conceptions,
