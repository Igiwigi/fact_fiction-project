This latter opinion, which M. de Reaumur patronized,,

- and which nature ſeemed to juſtify, became, in con-

ſequence, themoſt general ; but if the friends of the
other ſyſtem werethought to loſe their cauſe, it was only
for want of obſerving with a ſufficient depree of ac-
euracy the operations of nature, whoſe variety would
have furniſhed them with inſtances in their favour. Our bivalve inſe@ offers one, which the deſertion of
the old ſhell and the formation of a new one, in pro-
portion as the” animal grows, put beyond a doubt. The fact itſelf appears, not only from the obſeryation
of empty thells of different fizes, which are to be
wet with in waters, and are nothing more than the
ſpoils of our bivalve inſes; but, from the fingular
good fortune I had, in ſeeing one of the animals ſtrip
elf, entirely, in my preſence, of the membrane of
its ſhell, and of the exterior parts of its body, and ſhew
itſelf at laft before me abſolutely renewed, The
exuvice both of the ſhell and the animal's body were
tranſparent as the brighteſt cryſtal.. The joints of
the antenne, the briſtles, the feet, the ſmalleſt hairs, .
were more diſtinguiſhable than in the animal itſelf. . How infinitely {tnall are the organs, which, hid as it
were in ſheaths and caſes, only become viſible when
they are magnified {ome thouſands of times ! and
how many are there which eſcape the beſt microſcope! .
