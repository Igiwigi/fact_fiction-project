and 5:3 per cent. respectively. It may be objected to these deductions that in the above sections, the fact that the
stress at the vertex of the keyway is infinite, violates the physical conditions assumed
by the theory of elasticity and renders our results untrustworthy. My answer to this is that these cases should really be considered as limiting cases. If, instead of considering a section where the keyway is actually a straight line, we
consider a hyperbola with a very sharp bend, we can easily ensure, provided the
angle of torsion be not too great, that the physical conditions shall not be violated,
and, on the other hand, the values of the torsional rigidity (since they tend to a finite
limit) will differ but little from the values obtained above.
