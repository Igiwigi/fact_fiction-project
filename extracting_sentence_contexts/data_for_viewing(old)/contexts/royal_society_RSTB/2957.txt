Daut (1] and 18, p. 449) objected that Petsenxzer’s branchial septum was not
& branchial at all, but was pallial in origin, or was a forward growth of the siphonal
© septum. In reply to this, PELseNcER (70) stoutly contested the position he had
B taken up, and in 1891 (71, p. 219) explained that the septum must be branchial
2 in origin, since its tissue is supplied by the branchial nerve arising from the antero-
2 ® lateral angle of the visceral ganglion, and not by the siphonal or pallial nerve ; and,
2 noting the fact that the nerve runs at the outer edge of the septum, near the mantle
E (71, p. 243), concluded that the septum represented the inner demibranch, the outer
> being entirely absent. Gropeen’s researches (28) have led him also to the conclusion
Shthat at least the front part of the septum is branchial.
5 But Dat, in 1894 (14, p. 697), and 1895 (15, p. 537), still maintained that the
*S septum was an ingrowth from the mantle and siphon; and in 1897 he received the
support of PLATE (75), who, speaking of Cuspidaria obesa, regarded the septum as
3 pallial, since he found it to be innervated, not by the branchial branch of the visceral
2 nerve, but by a nerve arising, together with the visceral commissure, from the cerebral
8 3 ganglion.
S As the result of an examination of the branchial structures of P ‘oromya, Cetoconcha,
= and Cuspidaria, I do not consider that there is sufficient evidence to warrant the
g removal of the Septibranchia from the Eulamellibranchia as a separate Order, and in
