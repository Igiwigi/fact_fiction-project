The accounts of residents in the island and the distribution of damage to buildings
strongly suggested that most of the earthquakes were highly local in origin, the foci
in many cases probably lying under the island. Many of the local residents describe
their impressions of some of the more severe of the earthquakes in such terms as
“4 vertical shock”, “vertical bump”, etc. Further, the earthquakes were frequently
very localized in their effects, being described as severe at one place and trivial at
another 5 miles away. It is convenient to state here that the results obtained with
the various seismographs show conclusively that the great majority of the shocks do
arise from foci under the island.

The most severe earthquakes occurred at times of most pronounced seismic activity
as measured by the daily number of tremors. They produced considerable damage to
buildings but no loss of life resulted, owing to the fact that most of the population
dwell in light wooden structures. The few buildings of reinforced concrete were
unaffected, but even the most massive masonry structures, such as the windmill tower
on the Gages estate, were severely damaged.

At the time of the departure of the members of the expedition from England the
latest news from Montserrat was that of the very active period in November 1935.

4—DIsTRIBUTION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE JAGGAR SHOCK RECORDERS

Preliminary tests with the Jaggar shock recorders were made in a concrete fumiga-
torium situated at the Grove Botanical Station. The four horizontal instruments were
mounted in pairs on two walls at right angles with one another. The instruments
