the ‘bare’ apical area, since it depends solely on the phyllotaxis index.

Before leaving figure 7 attention may once again be drawn to the classification of the
apices by Church according to the numbers of contact parastichies. In general, as would
be expected, phyllotaxis index rises with the numbers of contact parastichies, but there are

notable exceptions. In Podocarpus, for instance, a (5+ 8) apex appears above a (6+ 10); or
again, the (7+-11) Araucaria apex has the same index as the (5+ 6) Lycopodium apex, and
apparently a lower one than even the (5+5). These discrepancies arise, of course, from the
fact that the contact parastichies in the various apices intersect at very different angles, and
hence do not really indicate the ‘bulk-ratios’, as Church assumed. The area ratio on the
other hand is a direct measure of precisely this kind and its logarithm is linearly related to
the phyllotaxis index, when the transverse component of the system is alone under con-
sideration, i.e.

With the aid of a table of natural logarithms it may be obtained even more simply from the
plastochrone ratio, as the reciprocal of 2 log, r.*
