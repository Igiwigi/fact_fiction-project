The break-up of sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic
has been studied during three field trips in the
spring of 1993 at Resolute, NWT, and the fall of
2001 and 2004 on McMurdo Sound via in situ cyclic
loading and fracture experiments. In this paper,
the back-calculated fracture information necessary to
the specification of an accurate viscoelastic fictitious
(cohesive) crack model is presented. In particular, the
