independent nuclear development may have originated further back in the multi-
nucleate prosoral stage but of that we can have no proof.

One exceptional case observed is worthy of mention. A large sporangium in an
unruptured sorus contained from 500 to 600 zoospores. The tissue in the neighbour-
hood was decaying, and the cells adjoining the host cell were already dead. In
addition to the zoospores, the sporangium contained 18 zygotes. At first, it
seemed probable that the last nuclear division had been omitted in their case, and
that they were simply zoospores of twice the normal size. But in three cases the
nuclei were double structures—which, however, were not the daughter nuclei of
a delayed final mitosis. They were, in fact, ordinary zoospore nuclei in the process of
fusion. The sporangium was unusually large, and it may be that some accident
prevented the cleavage walls from forming. That, however, does not alter the fact
that intra-sporangial fusion of gametes took place in these few instances, an occurrence
which serves to strengthen the belief in the normality of fusion between gametes of the
same sorus. ‘The wide question arises as to whether, in the particular case mentioned,
the organism under the stimulating effect of the presence of toxic substances may
not have had recourse to an earlier (? more primitive) method of sexual reproduction.

It has often been stated that, in nature, sori are developed in spring, while
resting sporangia do not appear until late summer and autumn, by which time sori
are no longer to be found, and it is hinted that the difference in the temperature of
the seasons is responsible for the formation of one or other of the types of repro-
ductive bodies. That more sori are formed at the beginning of the season and more
resting sporangia at the end is certainly true, but resting sporangia may and do occur
