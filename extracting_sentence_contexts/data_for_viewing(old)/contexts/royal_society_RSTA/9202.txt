H sin (¢ — 9)/Ssin p cos = $ o*[(U,, + V,, — 2A) — (Uy -+ Vy — 2B)).
Remarks.—(1) Observe that if we put U,, = U,, and V,, = Vy, the result becomes
H sin (¢ — $)/3 sin py cos b = — $ w (2A — 2B) = w* (B — A).

Therefore the deviation effect would still be accounted for in the case of WEBSTER’s
experiments, if the plate is of any other form than the circular.

(2) Next, the effect vanishes completely theoretically, if A = B, 7.e., in the circular
plate. But actually it is present as WEBsTER’s experiments show. Hence we have
had to give up the simple-doublet conception, and adopt that of an electronic orbit.
‘Then naturally retention of the next non-vanishing terms in the energy-function explains
the experimental facts.

PART III.
CHAPTER 5.

Non-saturation States.

[17] An attempt will be made in the following articles to extend the formule to
the case of weak fields, or to be more precise the case of non-saturation. Among the
causes that prevent a body being magnetized to saturation may be mentioned the
following: (i) the applied field is not strong enough ; (ii) temperature exerts demag-
netizing effects ; (iii) effects of impurities present in the crystal.
