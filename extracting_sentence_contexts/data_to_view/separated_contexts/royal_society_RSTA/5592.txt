Then characterizing the weak limit i amounts to looking at the weak L” closure : =

As already pointed out in the previous section, any limit i certainly satisfies an equation of the : =

where R is a deterministic analogue of the Reynolds stress tensor (2.1). The ‘convexity restriction’
alluded to in the previous section leads to the information that, for any x,t the tensor R(x, t) is
necessarily symmetric, positive semi-definite and |i| + tr R < M. In [21,22], it is shown that this is in fact the only constraint satisfied by the weak limit. The
main result can be formulated as follows:

Theorem 3.1. Let (iu, R) be a bounded weak solution of (3.3) such that R is symmetric and pointwise
either positive definite or zero.
