any close approach to accuracy, and the published tables are far less trustworthy
than those for a substance like common salt, which can be weighed out in an
anhydrous condition, or sulphuric acid, which can be purified by distillation and
freezing. In every case the solutions appear to have been standardised by titration,
and it is clear that the errors introduced by inaccurate values for the concentration,
and by neutral impurities in the solution, must have been many times greater than
those due to the mere measurements of density.

In the early tables of Ricurer (1795) and of Daron (1810) the density is given
to two places of decimals. A more ambitious table was published by TUNNERMANN |
in 1827 (‘Neues Journal der Pharmacie fiir Aertzte,’ vol. 18, p. 2), in which the
percentages of Na,O were given to three places of decimals (1 part in 30,000) and the
densities to four ; the additional accuracy of this table is for the most part fictitious,
as errors are to be found even in the second place of decimals. T&iNNERMANN’S values,
in conjunction with those of Daron, were, however, made use of 30 years later by
Scurrr (‘ Annalen,’ 1858, vol. 107, p. 300), who deduced from them a formula con-
necting density with concentration, his object being to obtain by extrapolation a value
for the density of fused 100-per cent. sodium hydroxide. Scurrr’s formula was used
by Geruace in 1867 (‘Zeitschrift fiir Analytische Chemie,’ vol. 8, p. 279) to
calculate the densities for each exact percentage of Na,O and NaOH, and Geriacn’s
table was reproduced in all the dictionaries and text-books of chemistry until
20 years ago.

It is remarkable that the crude measurements of density made in the early years
of last century should be still in use ; it is even more remarkable that during more
