Mr. Granan further remarks, © Colloidality is invoked chiefly with the view of account-
ing for the ready reunion, the redintegration as I have called it, of fragments of ice
brought into contact with each other. It is a very general (perhaps universal) character
of colloids to adhere and reunite when two masses are pressed together. In fact all our
adhesive substances, gum, glue, starch, &c., belong to the class of colloids. Even glass,
which is a colloid of fusion, shows the adhesive character, two sheets of polished plate
glass often adhering s0 thoroughly as to tear up each other's surface when forcibly sepa-
rated. Another colloid adhesive like ice, is fused phosphoric acid—- glacial * phosphoric
acid as it is called, in prescience, one might imagine, of this discussion ! No such adhe-
8ive property is ever found in crystalline surfaces, 0 far as I am aware. Tt is gu@ colloid
that ice appears to be adhesive. The discovery of Farapar's, of the adhesive quality of
ice, is the fundamental fact of the glacier discussion, The name *regelation ' applied
to it may, however, be objected to, being quite speculative, and implying, as it appears
to do, that two pieces of ice come to be cemented together by the freezing of a film of
water between them, instead of simply adhering perfectly and uniting as two pieces of
plate glass might do. The great fact, however, remains, and the name is but a trivial
matter.”

T also thought it right to inquire of Mr. GRanam the exact meaning he intended to
attach to the word ** demonstrated ” in the last sentence of the above quotation from his
memoir. A glacialist might possibly, I thought, if s0 disposed, interpret it as meaning
* proved ” or <* fully established.” In his answer Mr. GRAanaM says, © For * demon-
strated ' I should have said * indicated * as you suggest.” He also remarks, © You will,
T am certain, do good service in the glacier discussion by the precision you introduce
