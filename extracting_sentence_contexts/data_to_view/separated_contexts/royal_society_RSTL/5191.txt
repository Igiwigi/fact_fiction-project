1. It is very remarkable that Cuvier should not have recognized in the © espece de
menton,” and the © deux petits Ibvres*” of Pneumodermon, nor in the © deux tenta-
cules triangulaires ” of ClioF, the homologues of the foot of the Gasteropoda. In
fact it was on the strength of their having no such appendage that he founded his
new order of PteropodaZ, and yet the resemblance of the inter-alar appendages in

these two generay to the foot of Gasteropods is 80 striking as at once to point to their
real nature. * Mem. sur le Pneumoderme, p, 7. + Mem, ur le Clio, p. 6.
