growth velocity decreases. These errors cause DNA damage, which may result into mutations if
transmitted to offspring.

(d) Molecular evolution

The kinetics of DNA polymerases plays a pivotal role in understanding mutation rates and
molecular evolution. Mutation rates have been measured for different biological systems as a
function of their genome size [32]. Viroids have mutation rates in the range 10-3 <n <107
just below the equilibrium limit, as if non-equilibrium constraints could remain minimal for
the replication of such genomes. RNA viruses are in the range 10-°<1< 10-4, which is
consistent with the aforementioned values of the error probability for exonuclease-deficient
DNA polymerases. The mutation rates drop to 10-? <n <10~® for DNA viruses in agreement
with the fact that their DNA polymerases have acquired exonuclease proofreading. For bacteria
and eukaryotes, the mutation rates are in the range 10-™ < n < 10~°, which is possible thanks
to further proofreading with DNA mismatch repair [33-35]. In this regard, the general trends
of mutation rates during evolution can be understood on the basis of biochemical kinetics.
Furthermore, the genome size is observed to be inversely proportional to the mutation rate in
accordance with the Eigen—Schuster theory [36-38].

Besides, the evolution of DNA sequences under repeated replications can be simulated using
kinetic models of DNA polymerases. As seen in figure 5, the base pairs A:T become more frequent
than C:G from replication to replication in agreement with the higher probability to find A
