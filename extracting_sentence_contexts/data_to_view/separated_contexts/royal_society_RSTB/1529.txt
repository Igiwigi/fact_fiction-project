I have found
that at this period ovulation is exceedingly rare, although menstruation seems to
occur regularly enough. It is quite possible that, during the breeding season, ovula-
tion and menstruation may, as a general rule, have some definite close relation the
one to the other; at non-breeding times this is certainly not the case. Such comparison as we are able to make between the two animals, man and monkey,
lies in the fact that they both may menstruate without ovulation taking place. The monkey during non-breeding times rarely ovulates, the human female also does
not at all times do so; but whether these times in the human species are at regular
or irregular intervals, and whether they have any relation to definite times for
conception and breeding, there is no present means of knowing. Upon this latter
point I have some words to add in the following section.
