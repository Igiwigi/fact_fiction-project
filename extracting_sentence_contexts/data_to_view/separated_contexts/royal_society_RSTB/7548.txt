This was evident even when the wind speed near the ground
was less than 1 m./sec. and the ground was free of obstructions. The wind 8 m. above such
ground could hardly reach 4 m./sec. when it was less than 1 m./sec. near the ground. The fact that the data for winds of 4 to 7 m./sec. in figure 11 show a more clearly defined
orientation preference among higher fliers than among lower ones does not mean that the
lower fliers were less responsive. When watched continuously the lower fliers always seemed
to be more responsive, but in these strong and gusty winds their responses were variable and
did not result in steady flying in any one direction. If responsiveness did decrease with height but increased with wind speed, as required by
the hypothesis, what of the responses themselves?
