So far as the mean yearly and winter values of «, b and b/a are concerned,
Tables V. and X. are in practical agreement, but the equinoctial values of ) in
Table X. are decidedly lower, and the summer values decidedly higher, than the
corresponding quantities in Table V. The fact that the equinoctial values of b/a for
D and H in Table X. fall slightly below the summer ones seems hardly likely @ priori
to be a natural phenomenon, and it is not in accordance with the results obtained for
Greenwich, in Tables IT. and III., from the longer periods, where the variation of the
mean sun-spot frequency from month to month is naturally less than in 1890 to 1900.
