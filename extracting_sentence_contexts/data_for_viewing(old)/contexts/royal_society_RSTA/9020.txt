The Emanation Halo.

Haloes are found in considerable numbers in the Carlow mica, which consist of a
solitary ring showing no detail whatever within, and which are only clearly distin-
guished from the first ring of the uranium halo by their dimensions. They vary in
appearance much in the same manner as does the embryonic uranium halo, That is
to say, some show a greater degree of darkening than others. ‘They may present the
appearance of a delicate smoke-coloured ring, or be more or less darkened within,
the original ring appearing as a still darker border. They are often wonderfully
sharp in outline. At an early stage they may show the faint development of the
ring due to RaC, that is, of the fourth ring of the uranium halo, This fact at once
attaches them to the uranium series of elements.

In later stages we find development progressing just as in the uranium halo. We
may have the third ring as well as the fourth ring. The derivation of these haloes
from the emanation can, of course, only be inferred when the inner structure is
visible.
