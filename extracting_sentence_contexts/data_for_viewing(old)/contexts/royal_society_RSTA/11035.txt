OM,

By inspection of a diagram we see that m and m’ both vanish if the difference of
the amplitudes of @, and @, is less than 7, these amplitudes being measured between
0 and + 7 positively or negatively from the positive half of the real axis. In
particular when the real parts of @, and @, are both positive, m and m’ both vanish,
Not only so, but in all eases either m or m’ must vanish,

Again, if the difference of the amplitudes of , and @, is greater than a, m and m
cannot both vanish. In fact, in this case we have the important relation

m—-m=+1,
