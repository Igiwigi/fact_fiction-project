Naturally the theorem also gives Ny (_y) in the case
where % is any arbitrary circle. Later on (Theorem 13) we shall make Theorem 3 more precise by giving all possible
solutions of the set of conditions

as well as of the corresponding conditions describing general distributions of mass
occurring in the definition of Ny,* (y). In fact, these considerations, together with a
certain geometrical lemma (Theorem 14), will elucidate the whole nature of the
function Ny, (7). CoroLitaryt—If is closed, bounded, and convex, and if y + MM, then Ny (») > 1. For there is a closed half-plane § for which #%,» « §.
