The flow of a viscous fluid past an elliptic cylinder has been compared with mathe-
matical theory and agreement between them has been found to be close [in that region
of the field] in the neighbourhood of the front of the cylinder. In the outer field,
and towards the back of the cylinder, deviations occurred between theory and experi-
ment owing to the fact that the effects of the boundary walls and of the wake had
been neglected. The results obtained, however, justify an extension of the method
employed to conditions where the presence of the walls is considered, and where the
influence of the eddying wake is taken into account.
