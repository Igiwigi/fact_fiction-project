its apex by a circle of yery minute curved spicula, the capsule at the same instant
appearing empty (fig. 6). This phenomenon seems to consist in the sndden eversion
through one end of the capsule of a delicate sac which had previously lain invaginated
within it, and is generally immediately followed by the projection of a long and fine
filament from the free end of the everted sac. The structure of these thread-cells,
and the phenomena consequent on excitement, closely resemble what we find in the
© hastigerous organs” of Hydra. The greater minuteness however of the thread-
cells in Cordylophora renders it much more difficalt to obtain a satisfactory examina-
tion 'of their structure. The thread-cells are developed in the interior of mother-
cells (fig. 7), which are themselves secondary cells formed within the ectodermal
cells; but I was not able to determine how far their development devolves exclusively
S upon certain cells of the ectoderm specially devoted to this office. The ectoderm of
the tentacula differs slightly from that of the rest of the zoophyte, in the fact of
the thread-cells being for the most part collected into groups, which present the
appearance of little wart-like excrescences resembling the disposition of the cor-
© responding organs in the tentacula of Hydra. At the extremity of the tentacula
2 numerous thread-cells are crowded together, but there is no approach to the capitate
terminations which are 80 striking in Syncoryne, and which, among other characters,
zoologically distinguish that genus from Cordylophora.

(b.) Polypary.—The polypary (fig. 3 b, b) is a cylindrical tube investing the stems
S and branches of the zoophyte, and terminating just behind a short fleshy neck which
immediately supports the polypes. On the younger branches it forms a thin, and
almost colourless pergamentaceous investment ; but in older parts of the zoophyte it
is of a yellowish-brown colour, and composed of numerous layers. At the origin of
