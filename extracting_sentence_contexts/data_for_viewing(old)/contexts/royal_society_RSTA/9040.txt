In the above we have used the fact that C?R(C®) is zero by virtue of (8.24). To
evaluate the stresses, therefore, all that we require is the numerical value of C'Q, (C*)
and C'Q, (C).

(a) The System of Equations to Determine the Functions Q, (C*) and Qs (C?).

If we suppose Q, (C?) and Q, (C*) expanded as power series, the equations given
above for their determination, equations (8.33) and (8.34), will involve octuple integrals

of the type [wo (u—{) o|. This integral has been evaluated by CuaPMaN in

a recent memoir,t and we shall abbreviate our own work by using the same notation
