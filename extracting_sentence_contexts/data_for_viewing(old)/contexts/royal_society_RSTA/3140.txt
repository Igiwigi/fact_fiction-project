invariants (1885-1893); (2) Theory of algebraic number fields (1893-1898); (3) Foundations, (a)
of geometry (1898-1902), (b) of mathematics in general (1922-1930); (4) Integral equations (1902—
1912); (5) Physics (1910-1922). Weyl’s account implies that the passage from any of these fields to
the next was always clear-cut and irreversible, and a cursory examination of Hilbert’s published =
works may confirm this impression. But as Weyl himself probably knew better than many, : 5
the list of Hilbert’s publications provides only a partial, rather one-sided perspective of his
intellectual horizons, and this is particularly the case when it comes to his activities related to mea)
physics. :

More recent historical research has brought to light a very different picture of Hilbert’s [4

involvement with physics, and in particular of the real, truly central place of the ideas embodied DN
in the sixth problem within the general edifice of Hilbert’s scientific outlook. This is, in fact, 2S
the central topic of my book [6], as well as of additional works by other historians. Hilbert’s [8
involvement with physical issues spanned most of his active scientific life, and the essence .
of his mathematical conceptions cannot be understood without reference to that involvement.
More importantly, the famous ‘axiomatic approach’ that came to be identified with Hilbert’s
mathematical achievements in general and with his pervasive influence on twentieth-century
mathematics is totally misunderstood if it is not seen, in the first place, as connected with his
physical interests. Under this perspective, the involvement with kinetic theory and GTR is seen as
a natural outgrowth of the development of Hilbert’s world of ideas, and by no means as sporadic,
isolated incursions into unknown territories. Likewise, Hilbert’s role in the early development
of quantum mechanics and his work on the foundations of this theory in collaboration with
John von Neumann and Lothar Nordheim [7] are now more clearly understood as the outcome
of a direct involvement of more than a decade—mostly in the form of advanced research
