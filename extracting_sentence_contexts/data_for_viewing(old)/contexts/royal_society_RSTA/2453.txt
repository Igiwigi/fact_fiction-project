natural small ELM regimes, there are two possibilities known to reduce the ELM size, namely
pellet pacing and ELM control coils mounted behind the blanket on the VV wall. The author is
convinced that pellet pacing is not an acceptable method for ELM control, because it enhances the
edge density which will in turn reduce the pedestal width and height and thus reduce the energy
confinement significantly. The plasma may then drop out of the electron transport dominated
regime and thus may not have sufficient confinement for a reactor plasma.

ELM control coils on the other hand seem to work over a large parameter space; they also have
some disadvantages such as reducing particle confinement and thus density, however, with deep
pellet fuelling, this could most likely be overcome. While not all the physics of ELM control coils is
understood, they should be installed in a reactor on the VV wall. The installation of such copper-
based water-cooled ELM control coils is possible because the neutron radiation level behind the
blanket cannot be larger than in ITER due to the fact that the VV is also the first safety barrier in


a fusion reactor. Therefore, He production in the VV steel must be limited to similar values as in
ITER in order to allow rewelding.

The divertor of a fusion reactor should be similar in type to that in ITER following similar
design rules as explained below. There are several new ideas for a divertor such as the snow flake
and many others; however, if one wants to be economical the space inside the Toroidal Field (TF)
is very expensive and thus the volume of a divertor should be reduced to a minimum. In addition,
as demonstrated in the simulation model described below it is also possible to operate an ITER
like divertor below 10 MW m7? in a large 3 GW fusion power machine. The minimum divertor
