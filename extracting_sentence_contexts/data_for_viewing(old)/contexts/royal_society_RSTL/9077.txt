An equally striking mode of sterilization is now to be described. The crowding
together of the organisms 80 as to form in a multitude of cases a heavy, corrugated,
fatty seum upon the surface of the infusions obviously indicated that air was a necessity
of their life. In 8ome cases the oxygen dissolved in the infusions sufficed to enable
the Bacteria to cloud them from top to bottom ; but in many cases they gathered

at the top, and formed there a living layer through which no oxygen could pass to the
liquid underneath, which, thus surmounted, remained as clear as water. 'The obser-
vation of these facts, and many others of a similar bearing, suggested inquiry into the
effect which the more or less perfect withdrawal of the air from the infusions would haye
upon the development of life.

A few experiments with an ordinary air-pump were, in the first instance, made, The
necks of a series of bulbs charged with turnip-infusion were drawn out at the middle to
a tube of very small diameter. The open end of the neck being connected with the
air-pump, the bulbs were exhausted. In some cases, to render the removal of the air
more perfect, hydrogen was admitted into the bulb and was afterwards withdrawn by

'Q the air-pump. Before they were detached from the pump the bulbs were immersed in
[Ãž luke-warm water. They boiled freely, and after a minute's ebullition the narrowed
| E necks were hermetically sealed. 'The bulbs were then submerged in cold water, which
