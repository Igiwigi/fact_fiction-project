indicate that medullary tracheides were regularly present, forming an important
constituent of the pith where its dimensions were small, but occurring more sparsely
in stems where the pith was relatively large. This difference in degree is probably
not the mark of a specific distinction.

The structure of the stem of Calamopitys americana may thus be described as
protostelic, the proportion of tracheides to parenchyma in the “mixed pith” varying
inversely with the dimensions of the latter. The bearing of these facts on the .
affinities of our fossil will be considered when the rest of the structure has been

described.

In Calamopitys, as in Heterangium, it is only the peripheral strands of the primary
xylem which are concerned in the emission of leaf-traces.

The Secondary Wood.—The general structure of this tissue, which forms the great
bulk of each specimen, is shown in the photographs (Plate 29, Phot. 22; Plate 30,
Phots. 23, 25, 27, 29). The tracheides are on the whole smaller than those of the
primary strands, the latter commonly ranging from 80 to 120 p in diameter, while the
secondary tracheides vary from 30 to 60. The medullary rays are from two to eight
