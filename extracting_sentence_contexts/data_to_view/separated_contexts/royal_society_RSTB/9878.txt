First, although juveniles were more likely to inno-
vate than adults in one winter, the opposite was the case in at
least one other, suggesting that experience was just as signifi-
cant, or that cohorts may differ consistently over their
lifetime. Similarly, we expected immigrants to be at a disad-
vantage in our population [74,77], and to be more likely to
innovate, but their PSP did not differ from local-born birds. And because slow explorers tend to be poor competitors
during winter [39], we expected also a negative correlation
with EB but in fact found a positive correlation (see below). Finally, there was no influence of sex on PSP even though
females tend to be subordinate. Although this limited
evidence at the individual level for necessity driving inno-
vation is not surprising given conflicting evidence from the
literature, it contrasts with another study from our popu-
lation [62], which found that juveniles were more likely to
solve an innovative task than adults.
