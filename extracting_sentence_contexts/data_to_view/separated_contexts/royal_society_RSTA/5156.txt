On a non-consequentialist interpretation, the former portfolio
is worse than the latter if it runs too high a risk of forcing society to deploy climate engineering
in morally objectionable ways. None of these interpretations imply that reducing mitigation
necessarily yields a worse outcome; if climate engineering proves sufficiently cost-effective and
is used wisely, it might justify some reduction in mitigation. The fact that climate engineering research might justify some reductions in mitigation makes
it much harder to know whether the argument from mitigation obstruction provides a morally
compelling reason not to pursue climate engineering research. Various commentators have
described plausible mechanisms by which climate engineering research might induce some
reductions in mitigations. But it is very difficult to know whether those reductions would be
so large or so poorly planned that they would lead to a worse outcome than would result
without climate engineering research.
