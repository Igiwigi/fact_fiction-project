description, the archesporium may be a single cell, a row of cells, or even a lay
sheet of cells (loc. cit., p. 564). This my observations, to be detailed below,
confirm. The only definite limit which Gorpen assigns for all Vascular t
which he investigated is that of depth of origin; they are all hypodermal,

how any strict topographical definition can be applied to the archesporium
shall hold for all Vascular Cryptogams. It is true that in most Vascular Crypto
and probably in all, the archesporium is ultimately referable in its origin to
segmentation of one or more superficial cells. But what part of the shoot in|
plants does not originate in this way? A statement of this fact would be in no
distinctive in plants in which one or more initial cells are commonly the ultimate pai
of the tissues of all parts, whether deeply seated or superficial. While the resul
my observations on sporangia of Vascular Cryptogams will confirm GOEBEL's state
that the sporogenous tissues are referable in origin to a definite cell or cells (
sporial cells), I find it impossible to give to these cells a strict topographical defi
which shall apply in all cases.
This conclusion need be in no way surprising, for it is plain, in the first place,
the segmentation which gives rise to the archesporium, in Vascular Cryptoge
different from that in Phanerogams; in the latter the dermatogen is as a
definite, and distinct in origin and segmentation from the subjacent hypoder
cells, which ultimately give rise to the sporogenous tissue.
In the second place the origin of the archesporium in the Musci is not unif
