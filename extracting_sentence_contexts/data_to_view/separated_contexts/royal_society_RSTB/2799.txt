It is a fact illustrated in the sporophyte of the most
various plants. * It should, however, be pointed out at once that the facts of
sterilisation are compatible with either of the above views as to the origin of
the sporophyte; the difference between the two views lies in the extent to which
it is held that sterilisation has been operative in the past. The antithetic theory
proceeds on the ground that all vegetative tissues of the sporophyte ultimately
originated by sterilisation of potentially fertile cells. On the homologous view
sterilisation has only played a secondary part.
