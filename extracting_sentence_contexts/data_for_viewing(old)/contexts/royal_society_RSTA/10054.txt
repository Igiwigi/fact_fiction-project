surface. This was mainly due to the surface of these ash deposits, like those to be
presently mentioned on the plateaux and on the ridges, having consolidated into a
crust almost like a cement pavement which resists the action of the rain. Another
very curious and, it is believed, novel point was observed with regard to these massive
ash deposits. Instead of one stream re-establishing itself along the centre of the
deposit, the tendency is for a new stream to form on each side at or near the
junction of the new ash with the old valley walls, and as these streams deepen
themselves, two new valleys are formed where only one previously existed, and the
walls of each are composed on the one side of the new ash, and on the other of
older tuff with oceasional terraces of new ash. Sometimes the two valleys coalesce
by the washing away of the central mass, but quite often the two remain distinct,
as in the case of the Trespé Rivert and Wallibu Dry River to be mentioned
shortly. The fact of this side formation of streams is clear; it is seen in the
ravine just noticed, also in the upper Rozeau, and in several of the plates in
Part 1, where, though not noticed at the time owing to its being then in an early
stage, it is distinctly visible when looked for, but the cause is not so clear. It
appears to be due to the fact that the water from the old slopes in running down
into the original valley meets the soft new ash, and at once turns down along the
valley and so starts the new stream, and it seems likely that the chief cause of its so
turning is that the surface of the deposit tends to be higher along the middle of the
valley than at the sides, the shape of the mass somewhat resembling a glacier, which
it is well known is usually higher in the middle because of the more rapid motion ot
that part.
