Here we have two fields, the green and the blue, which are practically identical,
showing that the limits of the boundaries are not affected by the hue, though, of course,
the illumination is very different in the two cases. Attention must here be drawn to
the fact that, though, according to Herrneâ€™s theory, the fields of the dissimilation
colours ought to be both external, or else both internal, to the fields of the assimilation
colours, they differ in each pair, and the frequency of similar want of accordance
has been very generally met with.

14, Fields of Impure or Mixed Colours.

When considering the question of the fields of mixed colours, such as those
produced by pigments, it became apparent that a crucial test as to their efficiency
might be made by mixing colours of the spectrum together to imitate some single
spectrum colour, and, after making the mixture of the same luminosity, to compare
the fields. With this in view, a red and green, near E, were mixed together to
match the D light in hue and in intensity. The fields for each colour, including D,
