day, which is divided into hours, minutes, Cc. of
apparent time. 'The ſolar day, it is manifeſt, and
its hours, minutes, &c. are of different lengths, at |
different times of the year: on account of which |
inequality, a good clock, which keeps equal time,
cannot long agree with the ſun's motion, which is
unequal. Therefore, aſtronomers have deviſed an
imaginary time, called mean ſolar time; which is
what would be pointed out by the ſun, if his motion
