Uncertainty can therefore be a source of [5
actionable knowledge rather than an indicator of ignorance. D&

This issue of Philosophical Transactions is dedicated to examining the role of uncertainty in ,
climate change. Given the inherent nature of uncertainty in climate science and especially in the
probabilistic forecasting of future climate change (e.g. temperature, rainfall or sea-level change),
this topic has received much attention and in fact is deeply embedded in the existing literature
in multiple disciplines, from climate science to economics to cognitive science (e.g. [7-10]). This
issue of Philosophical Transactions does not review that embedded literature, but instead explores
the relationship between uncertainty and actionable knowledge. As we show later, the articles in
this issue draw a wide arc that touch on many aspects of this complex question, from physical,
economic and social perspectives.
