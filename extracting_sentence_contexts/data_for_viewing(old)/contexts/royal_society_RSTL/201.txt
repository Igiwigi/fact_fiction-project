by which we may trace it wherever it is, and determine its
quantity. Here then'a new field is open for experiments and
observations ;* since by connecting hygrometry with | hygro-

S logy, the hygrometer is for us in the atmosphere, what the
v manometer is in close vessels.

E The particular experiments which I have to relate, have
S that connection in view; as they will shew, that in a close
Â® vessel, either filled with air, or free from it, the product of
2 evaporation affects, at the same time, the hygrometer and the
= manometer; the former by moisture, the latter by pression.

E the course of the theory, which, from hygrology, leads to hy-
2 grometry, by certain laws demonstrated in the fluid which is
E the cause of moisture.

5 Of the Laws of Hygrometry.

EZ 1. The science of hygrometry derives its origin from the
= cause whence proceeds, that the density of steam has different
YZ maxima, accordingto the temperature. I have shewn, in my
E last work on meteorology, that in the particular association of
