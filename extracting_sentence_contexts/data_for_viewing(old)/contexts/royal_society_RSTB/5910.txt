Marsuatt’s table of measurements, in which he contrasts the European brain with
the Bushwoman’s, the European brain is smaller in certain dimensions. This indicates
that he specially selected an abnormally small European brain for comparison.

Whilst the question of racial difference is one of great interest, it is necessary to
emphasize that this is the description of the brain of an individual Bushwoman and
therefore of morphological rather than of racial importance. It may be that the very
primitive features to be described point to the lowly condition of the race to which she
belonged ; but in the present state of our knowledge the evidence of this from one
specimen must be inconclusive. When working on the brain of the Australian aboriginal
in Sydney, I found in twenty-five hemispheres that the sulcus lunatus was not a
constant feature, and mentioned this fact to Professor Exnttor Smrra (see Morr
Memorial Volume). In the following year I had the opportunity of examining another
eight hemispheres in Brisbane and found in every one of them a well-marked sulcus
lunatus. It must be emphasized, therefore, that whilst percentage occurrence of features
may be of great importance, in a limited series they are not necessarily significant.

Concerning the remainder of MarsHatv’s description it can be said that, apart from
the sulcal pattern in which there are some errors in his figures, the information con-
cerning the general form, relations, dimensions, and most of the sulci can be used with
confidence. He was careful when removing the brain, already fixed in situ, to as-
certain the extent of the deformation consequent upon fixation. Furthermore, his
detailed description of the closure of the cranial sutures, of the form of the skull, and
other observations permit the direct comparison of this interesting brain with the
