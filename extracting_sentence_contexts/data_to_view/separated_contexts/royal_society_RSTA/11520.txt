After H had been measured, the taps associated with the oil gauge were turned so as
to cause it to record the excess pressure at the high pressure ends of the tubes over
that of the atmosphere, in the manner described on p. 208. It may be thought that since it was impossible to keep the bell quite still during
the passage of the gas from the reservoir to the bell an error might arise, owing to
the motion of the bell affecting the pressure, and consequently the flow, in virtue of
the viscosity of the oil in the pressure regulator. The fact that the bell was in the
same position when both times were recorded, however, insured, as will be seen from
the following consideration, that no error arose from this cause, even though the
motion of the bell might be quite irregular. For let f be the deviation of the rate of
flow of the gas from its normal value* owing to the fluctuations in pressure, p the
deviation of the pressure of the gas in the bell from its normal value, owing to the
motion of the bell. Over the small range of pressure considered we may assume f
proportional to p, say f= cp.
