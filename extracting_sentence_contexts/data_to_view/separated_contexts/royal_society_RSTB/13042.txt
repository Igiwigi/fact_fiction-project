However, there are alternative pathways of synthesis
They are (1) L-glutamate, (2) D- and (3) L-aspartate, (4) glycine, and catabolism of monoamines and acetylcholine in other
(5) gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), (6) D-serine, (7) seroto- eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The detection of monoamines or
nin, (8) dopamine, (9) noradrenaline, (10) adrenaline, (11) acetylcholine in some tissues might be owing to bacterial
octopamine, (12) tyramine, (13) histamine, (14) acetylcholine, contamination. In fact, some bacteria names are dedicated to
(15) taurine, (16) protons, (17) ATP, (18) nitric oxide (NO), the high synthesis of acetylcholineâ€”Bacillus acetylcholini; these
(19) carbon monoxide (CO) and (20) H2S. The list might incor- and related bacteria acetylate choline and present in fermented
porate short lipids (derivatives of arachidonic acid, acting sauerkraut and silos [89]. The presence and usage of transmit-
on cannabinoid receptors), trace amines, purines such as ters in particular animals might reflect enzymatic activities of
adenosine, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, etc. symbionts and associated microbiota.
