PART L—(1) Tae Evo.urion or AMBULACRAL STRUCTURE IN THE REGULAR
ECHINOIDEA,
(a) Preliminary Note.

In this section a summary is given of the general.characters of ambulacral structure
in the corona of the Regular Echinoidea. The account is only to a small degree
original, and to a less extent exhaustive. It is necessary, however, to prefix a résumé
of this kind to the morphological and morphogenetic considerations of the succeeding
sections. Although but few of the observations recorded are new, it is believed that
the facts already known are here first collected into a coherent scheme, and that
they are interpreted in a fresh manner.

For the ambulacral characters of the Palszeozoic Echinoids, I have relied almost
entirely on JacKson’s “ Phylogeny of the Echini” (1912). The account of these
structures in the other Regular orders has been gathered from a very large number
of sources.

The classification adopted for the post-Palzeozoic forms is that given by Grecory
(1900). Although the more recent taxonomic system of JACKSON (1912) is available,
and in some respects preferable, it has proved more satisfactory to treat of the
morphology of the ambulacra in association with the older scheme. This is doubtless
due to the close accord between Grecory’s classification and that of Duncan (1889) ;
