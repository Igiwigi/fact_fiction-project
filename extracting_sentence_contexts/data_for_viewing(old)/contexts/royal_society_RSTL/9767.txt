| molecules and the frequency of the collisions between them. As we are of opinion
> that there are no sufficient grounds for such a supposition, but that, on the contrary,
- the phenomena are compatible with the ordinary molecular theory of gases, we hall
d-! proceed to state our views upon the snbject, and the experimental facts upon which
these views are based.
Tt is by no means an unusual phenomenon to find streams of particles driven off
4 from the surface of bodies highly charged with electricity. The very familiar
phenomenon known as the * electric wind ‚Äù is an instance of this kind. In this case
+ particles of air are driven off from the pointed terminal of an electric machine or a
S highly charged Leyden jar with such force that they produce a perceptible wind ; and
Zthoir reaction can be made to turn a vane much in the same way as Crookes' electric
Sradiometer is turned by the electric discharge in a vacuum. This phenomenon is
Z admitted to be due to the repulsion between the highly charged conductor and the
-S neighbouring particles of air which have become charged in a like sense by coming in
Zcontact with it.
ob There are, it is true, many peculiarities of this
