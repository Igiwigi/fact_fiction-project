was accordingly near the temperature of consolidation, or may even in part have solidified
already” (Report, Part I, p. 523). This hypothesis received the most unexpected
confirmation at a slightly later period when it was announced that the magma in
Pelée was being extruded as a solid vertical column or obelisk which attained at one
time a height of 900 feet.

Of the minerals of these dusts the most abundant is plagioclase felspar. Its
crystals are often broken, but the smaller may be perfect, especially when they have
an adherent pellicle of glass. Optical and specific gravity tests, especially the
extinctions of cleavage flakes, show that they range from labradorite to basic
bytownite (An 50 per cent. to An 84 per cent.). They are full of glass enclosures,
often of regular shape, with fixed bubbles. Zonal structure is very common in them ;
in fact, they present similar characters to those of the phenocrysts in the bombs, to
be described later. The commonest faces are 001, 010, 110, 110, 101, 201. The
augite is pale brownish-green, very slightly pleochroic in thick grains. Good crystals
are rare and show 100, 010, 110, 111. The extinction angle Z:c is about 45 degrees.
Hypersthene is always present in considerable amount and often its crystals are very
perfect. Their faces are 100, 010, 110, and probably 111. Frequently the crystals
are broken across, along planes of fracture perpendicular to the prism axis; they then
show squarish octagonal outlines with the pinacoids larger than the prism faces.
