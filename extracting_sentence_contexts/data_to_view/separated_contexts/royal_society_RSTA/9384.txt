The diagram
also shows the curious fact that the departure from a linear relation is much more
pronounced for lines of small wave-length. For large wave-lengths the ratio is nearly
equal to unity. This is partly, but not entirely, due to the fact that the lines of great
wave-length have not been examined over the full range of pressures. There is a
