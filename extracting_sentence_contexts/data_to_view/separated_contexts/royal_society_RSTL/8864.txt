On the 25th

'S one and all coyered with a layer of deeply pitted and corrugated fatty seum. Thus
S far, then, I was defeated in my efforts to escape contamination.

'S During these experiments a fact was observed which repeated itself afterwards in
Z other instances. Samples of the different infusions were always exposed to the common
2 air beside their respective chambers, and in general these outside samples became
Ez turbid and covered with scum a day or 80 before the interior tubes gave notice of
Â£5 breaking down; but here, in the case of the turnip, the outside tube continued pellucid
5 and free from life for 8ome time after the inside ones had become turbid with organisms.
pl How could this be? 'The case of my two trays placed one above the other last year *
I suggested itself to my memory. In point of life-development it was then found that
8 the lower tray was always in adyance of the upper one.
