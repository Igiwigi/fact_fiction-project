or 3 per cent. by the formula

x +
ty = 1+Ap’/p ie Bp/p’

(modelled on a similar formula for the viscosity of gases which we shall consider
presently). As there were only four observations and two empirical constants the
fact is not very remarkable; when p = 0 of course 3,, = 9’, and when p’ = 0 we have
3. =. A much better agreement was obtained by allowing the empirical constants
A and B (obtained by the method of least squares) to be imaginary.
