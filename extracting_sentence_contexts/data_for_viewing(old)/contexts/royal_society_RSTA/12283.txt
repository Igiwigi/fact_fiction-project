ment with No. 31, and also with the Cavendish. They have since been compare
with the Berlin Standard, and appear to exceed that standard by about ‘0002 volt,

It will be noticed that the results of the comparison on September 6th are
much closer agreement than those of previous dates. his is partially due to
potentiometer, since the adjustment in this case has not to proceed by steps.
must be remembered also that the cells had been kept (by the regulator «
described) at a steady temperature for a considerable time ; and the great impo
of a constant temperature is rendered evident by the figures given in Table L, a
illustrates the truth of Mr. GrazeBroox’s remark that many discrepancies are du
to the different “lag” of the cells when their temperature is changing.

A consideration of the above facts will, we believe, bear out the conclusion
the mean value of our Clark cells may be regarded as exceeding that of ti
Cavendish standard by not more than ‘0002 volt (i.e, by about 1 in 7000). Dario
our J experiments we always used a considerable number of these cells, placing
several in parallel are, and in no case did we use less than nine of them at any. ne
time. Thus no correction for individual cells is necessary.

A reference to GLAZEBROOK and SKtNner’s paper will show that but a short tim
elapsed between their determination of the absolute value of the Cavendish standard
and the comparison of our cells with that standard. The absolute value of
standard is given by them as 1°4342 volt ;{ we are therefore justified in assuming
the mean value of cells No. 31 to 54, as
