Threshold activity ¢, as a function of the alignment parameter & for multiphase and multicomponent models with

understood. It is probably related to the fact that the particles are flow tumbling if § < €* and
flow aligning if & > &*, where &* =3S/(S + 2). Thus, for the MP model &* = 0.43 and, while for
the MC model, &* = 0.51 since y = 2.8 and Sy =0.41. However, even in passive nematics flow
alignment may lead to non-trivial effects [23] and how it affects the interfacial anchoring of active
nematics is beyond the scope of this work.
