What is it that is expanding and how? Since space-time is all-inclusive, it
has to expand on its own which means it is being created anew at each epoch as it expands [14]. The Universe or space-time was not only created in the beginning in the Big Bang, but is in fact
being created continuously at each instant and everywhere. This reminds one of the steady state
theory [15] of continual creation of matter out of nothing. There is however one critical difference.
