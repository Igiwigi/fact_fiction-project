rays) is extinguished according to the simple logarithmic law. But each ray has its
own modulus, or coeflicient of extinction, which depends on two things, namely, the
composition of the incident heat, and the specific nature of the medium, as regards
each of the integral kinds of heat. Hence the initial rate of extinction will depend
almost entirely upon the portion of heat very easily extinguishable, which exists in the
calorific beam, and not sensibly upon those persisent kinds of heat for which the me-
dium in question is nearly diaphanous ; whilst at great thicknesses the former class of
rays being entirely extinguished as to sense, the latter class, namely, the more persistent
ones, alone exercise any influence on the curve of extinction. Thus it appears, that
since we have no & priori method of discoyering the compoxition of any mixed kind
of heat from 8uch a source as the sun, it must be impossible to conclude with certainty
the law of loss or extinction at mall thicknesses, from observations of the Jaw of ex-
tinction at great thicknesses ; for they are not in point of fact the same rays which
are undergoing extinction in the one case and in the other, and therefore the conti-
nuity of the law cannot be assumed with any degree of certainty. The indication of
