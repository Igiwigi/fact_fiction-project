RICHARDSON ON THE SECRETORY

and, after staining with iron hematoxylin, resemble black bristles inserted in the
ducts. During fixation, the secretion appears to remain undistorted, and it exhibits no
visible variation with all the fluids used in this investigation (cf. the albumen). These facts, taken in conjunction with the viscosity of the secretion in the free state,
suggest that the secretion is quite different from albumen. It must be noted,
however, that the appearance of the glands at any secretory stage in the isthmus
is closely similar, after Zenker-formol fixation, to the single resting phase of the
albumen glands, ¢f. fig. 15, Plate 16 with fig. 10, Plate 15. The identification of the
isthmal glands as albumen glands, by several previous authors, is possibly due to a
confusion of these individual stages.

(b) The ciliated epithelium during secretion—The individual isthmal folds have a less
evenly rounded form in section, which is possibly due to the fact that the tubular
glands of this region do not expand to the same extent as in the albumen region.
