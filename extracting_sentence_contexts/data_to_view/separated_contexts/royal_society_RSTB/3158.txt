Two other important differences, not hitherto insisted on, contribute to distinguish
the glabellar region of the Neandertal from that of the Australian skull. They find
expression in the measurements given in the following table :—t

It will be seen that the glabella-inion line, which except in the Gibraltar skull
corresponds with the maximum length, is longer than the ophryo-inion line, but
much more so in all the members of the Neandertal group than in the Australian
skull No. 998 ; this is due to the fact that the glabellar fossa is strongly marked in the
former, and barely existent in the latter. It is, indeed, largely owing to the presence
of its associated fossa that the torus in the Neandertal skulls, as in the anthropoid
‘apes, stands out in such high relief. In Australian skulls the fossa is generally better
expressed over the brow ridges than above the glabella.
