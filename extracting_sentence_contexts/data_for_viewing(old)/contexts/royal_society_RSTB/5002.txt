they had attained in the ovary of the 3 weeks old chick at the close of the extra-follicular
growth period. Others, however, appear to grow more rapidly, as is shown by the
maximum measurements for the 3, 6, and 11 weeks chicks. The difference between
the maximum size of the oocytes of the 3 and 6 weeks chicks is enormous, being more
than 500 per cent. ; however, the maximum size of the oocytes of the 6 and 11 weeks
chicks is the same. From this it is clear that many of the oocytes enter upon a period
of rapid growth between the third and sixth week after hatching. The cytological
evidence shows that, in the 6 weeks chick, all the oocytes over 75y in diameter exhibit
marked abnormalities and signs of atresia. In the 11 weeks chick all the oocytes over
100» exhibit a more advanced stage of atresia. I conclude, therefore, that all those
oocytes, which enter upon the period of rapid growth between the third and sixth week,
are abnormal and fated to become atretic without ever reaching maturity. They have,
in fact, entered precociously upon the growth stage (the intra-follicular growth stage
of D’HotianpeEr) and by the sixth week all are showing signs of atresia. As the atretic
condition is much more advanced in all the oocytes over 100% in diameter in the
11 weeks chick, we can assume that no more oocytes enter upon a period of precocious
growth between the sixth and eleventh week after hatching. Further, although the
smallest precocious oocytes of the 6 weeks chick grow a little during this period, as
is shown by the increase of 33} per cent. in the minimum size, the larger ones do not
grow at all, as the maximum size remains constant. If Table I is corrected in view
