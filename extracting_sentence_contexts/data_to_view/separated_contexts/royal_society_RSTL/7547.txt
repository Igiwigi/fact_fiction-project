In the lower or anterior part of each is seen the group of large cells (t'
which form the hypoglossal nuclens; and in the upper or posterior part is seen ano
and oval group of smaller cells (z”), forming part of the nucleus of the spinal-access0:
nerve. Behind this group of cells, the part # is finer in texture, consisting of granul
nuclei, small cells, and fine fibres. The posterior pyramid (b) is rather larger than i
fig. 19, but it now begins to be beyelled off at its base, just below 6b; and between it an
the spinal-accessory nucleus (7) there is a small triangular and paler mass (4"), which is i
fact the inner side of the base of the pyramid, where it was joined to its fellow at th;
bottom of the median fissure, as seen at 6”, fig. 19, enclosed in the dotted line on the
right side. The outer restiform nucleus (c') has increased considerably in dimensions,
while the inner nucleus (0) has somewhat diminished (compare figs. 7 & 8, Plate VIII,
of human medulla on the right side). The decussating fibres (2, y') proceeding from
the side of the spinal-accessory nucleus to the opposite olive and anterior pyramid are
less numerous.
