values of 8,(t) are given with their proper sign as determined incidentally in the
determination of their times of occurrence (§ 4.11).

The effect of the cards on the observed value of the period and on s, is ignored in
Tables V. and VI. The results obtained here are corrected for this effect, as far as
possible, before use in Table I. The information given in Table VI. is deduced
directly from Table V. by the equations of §4.11. In certain cases where the yaw
was large it was checked by use of the chart of § 3.7.

The total percentage spread of the values of s (or «) in the group is in most cases

* satisfactorily small. The value of 6-7 per cent. for the high velocity group of type I.
shells is probably partly due to the fact that the fuzes of shells 1-to 4 were slightly
damaged before firing in forcing the shells into the cartridge cases.

At a velocity of 1580 fs. results were obtained with guns of both twists of rifling.
The couple deduced from the results for the gun rifled one turn in 40 calibres is, in the
cases of shells of types I. and IIL. slightly smaller than that deduced from the other
gun. This is to be expected as the stability in this case is nearly critical and the
maxima are rather large (one maximum is as much as 13 degrees for a type I. shell).
The solution of § 3.6 can hardly be expected toapply. The next term in the expression
for » of the form ,, sin* d may be expected to be becoming appreciable here ; apparently
its sign is such that it will tend to diminish the observed value of «, in agreement
with wind channel observations (fig. 2). For the shells of type Il. the maxima of
the yaw are small in both guns and the results are in agreement.
