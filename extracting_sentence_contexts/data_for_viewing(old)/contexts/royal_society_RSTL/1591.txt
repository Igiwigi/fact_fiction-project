If oxymuriatic gas be used, not freed from vapour, or if the
potassium has been previously exposed to the air, a little
moisture always separates during the process of combustion.
When pure potassium, and pure oxymuriatic gas are used,
the result, as I have stated, is a mere binary compound, the
same as muriate of potash, that has undergone ignition.

The combustion of potassium and sodium in oxygene gas,
is much less vivid than in oxymuriatic gas. From this pheno-
menon, and from some others, I was inclined to believe that
the attraction of these metals for oxygene is feebler, than
their attraction for oxymuriatic gas. I made several experi-
ments, which proved that this is the fact ; but before I enter
upon a detail of them, it will be necessary to discuss more
fully than I have yet attempted, the nature of the combina-
tions of potassium and sodium with oxygene, and of potash
and soda with water.

I have stated-in the last Bakerian Lecture, that potassium
and sodium, when burnt in oxygene gas, produce potash and
Soda in a state of.extreme dryness, and very difficult of fusion.
In the experiments from which these conclusions are drawn,
as I mentioned, I used trays of platina, and finding that this
metal was oxidated in the operation, I heated the retort
strongly, to expel any oxygene the platina might have ab-
