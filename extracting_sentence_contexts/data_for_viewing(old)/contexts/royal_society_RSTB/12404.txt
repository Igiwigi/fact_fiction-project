all three samples, eleven proteins were present in at least
two of the samples, and two proteins were only found in
one sample (electronic supplementary material, figure S2).
In the HF-treated crude adhesive material no arginine-rich
peptides from the LMW components were found. This is
likely due to the fact that the LMW components diffuse
quickly out of the unfixed SDS-PAGE gel and were therefore
lost from the gel before in-gel digestion.

In these proteins, the GDPH motif functions as a pH depen-
dent autocatalytic cleavage site (cleavage between D and P).
For 10 of these A. coffeaeformis proteins (Ac629, Ac3782,
Ac643, Ac2602, Ac16476, Ac1396, Ac3113, Ac1589, Ac6233,
Ac889) the GDPH motif designates the start of a well con-
served approximately 28 kDa C-terminal region, which we
termed GDPH domain (figure 2). Proteins Acl442 and
Ac1953 contain the GDPH motif, but their downstream
