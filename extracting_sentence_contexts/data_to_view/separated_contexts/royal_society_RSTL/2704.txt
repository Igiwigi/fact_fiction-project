Thus it is necessary, as we have by direct experiment found to be the case,
that the organs of the neryous system $should be placed under the control of the
sensorial power. Through the same channel, we have seen, this power also, in some
of their functions, controls the muscles of involuntary motion ; and we have reason
to believe, although the point has not been ascertained by direct experiment, all the
powers of the living blood. And such, as appears from facts aboye referred to, is
its influence on the neryous, and through it, on the muscular power, and we haye
reason to believe on the powers of the living blood, that it can not only excite, but
impair and instantly destroy all these powers, according to the nature and power of
the causes which influence its organs. The circumstance of the muscular, as appears from facts aboye referred to, being
the moving power of the blood in the vessels as well as the heart, greatly extends
the influence of those powers which control it, namely the neryous power properly
80 called, and the sensorial power acting through it. 6
