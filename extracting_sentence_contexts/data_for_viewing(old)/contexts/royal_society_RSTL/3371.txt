diameters ; the only difference being, that the magnetism of the revolving disc
is transient, and constantly changing its poxsition ; s0 that the neutral points
are always near the poles of the suspended bar. The bar therefore by a well-

known law of magnetic attraction, will be constantly endeayouring to place
itself at right angles to the magnetic equator of the disc, whilst the position of
the latter varies in its turn with the position of the bar: it is in fact owing to
this circumstance that the bar at length reyolvyes with the disc, as may be in
great measure seen by substituting for the disc a similar disc of steel made
permanently magnetic ; in which case the suspended bar will not revolve, it
will be merely put into a state of disturbed vibration.
