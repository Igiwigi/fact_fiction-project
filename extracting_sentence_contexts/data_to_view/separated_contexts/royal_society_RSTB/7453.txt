The data required for these calculations are given in table 18,
superscripts denoting accidental deaths for which corrections have been made. From these analyses the constant survival rates (P) and standard errors per period are
estimated as follows:

Sept. to Jan. P=0-874+-0-040 (mean interval 4-81 weeks)
Jan. to May P=0-544+0-044 (mean interval 5-62 weeks)

A slight error is introduced by the fact that the intervals between trappings were unequal. However, the order of magnitude of the change in death-rate is undoubtedly shown by

comparing weekly death-rates based on the mean intervals within the two periods.
