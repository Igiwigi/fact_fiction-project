It is, however, to be observed that there is no clear indication
of an increase in the ratio as the film thins, The value corresponding to the smallest
optical thickness is not the greatest in the cases of film 2, July 12, and film 4,
July 11, and is actually the least of those furnished by measurements on film 3, ;
Faly 11. sy The optical and electrical measurements of the thickness of black films formed of
#28 per cent. solution are in as close accord as the nature of the experiments will
yermit, the electrical being as a matter of fact rather the smaller of the two. Thus,
fom Tables VII. and I., we get 10°6 p.y.,and 12°4 p.p., for the mean electrical and optical

icknesses respectively. The discrepancies between the individual experiments are
tZo great to enable us to insist on the accuracy of this difference, but it is evident
téat there is no such striking divergence between the results of the two methods as
i@remarked when no salt is present.
