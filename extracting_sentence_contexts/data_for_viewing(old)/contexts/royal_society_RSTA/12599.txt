the magnetic storms recorded at Greenwich from 1848 to 1903, claimed to have
discovered a period of 27°275 days, corresponding to the time of rotation of the sun-
spot zones on the sun. The validity of Mr. Maunper’s claim to have established a
period was supported by the present Astronomer Royal amongst others, on arguments
based on the mathematical theory of probability.

I had myself} occasion, at the instance of the Editor of ‘Terrestrial Magnetism,’ to
read carefully and criticise the first of Mr. Maunpmr’s papers, dealing with magnetic
storms from 1888 to 1903. The result left me undecided whether Mr. Maunprr had
established his case. One important point in favour of his contention was that
practically the same periodic time had been deduced from a study of magnetic storms
at Toronto by Mr. ArrHur Harvey,§ he and Mr. Maunper being ignorant of each
other’s work. A second fact in its favour was that a list of 125 magnetic storms at
Kew between 1890 and 1900, got out by myself in an absolutely unprejudiced way,
gaye 21 intervals of from 25 to 28 days, while intervals of from 21 to 24 days and 29
to 32 days numbered respectively only 7 and 9. I experienced, however, a difficulty
as to the proper mathematical basis for applying a probability caleulation. As it so
happened, the standard of disturbance accepted as defining a magnetic storm was such
that the average interval between successive Greenwich storms from 1888 to 1903 was
29 days, and that between successive Kew storms from 1890 to 1900 was 28 days,
both being intervals undesirably close to the supposed period. Another difficulty was
that the times of commencement of the storms, from which Mr. Maunprer derived his
intervals, had an extraordinarily marked diurnal period, showing that they were
