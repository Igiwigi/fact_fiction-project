If chromic acid be a compound of

as the analysis of it by means of sulphuretted hydrogen has
Shown it to be, it is obvious, that in order to reduce an atom
of chromic acid to green oxide, we must mix it with three
atoms of protoxide of iron. Now, 52:125 grains of proto-
sulphate of iron contain the equivalent for s atoms of pro-
toxide, while 12:5 grains of chromate of potash contain the
equivalent for an atom of chromic acid. These facts being
understood and remembered, we are prepared for following
the details of the experiment.

12'5 grains of crystallized chromate of potash ( containing
&'5 grains of chromic acid) were dissolved in a small quan-
tity of boiling-hot distilled water. 52-125 grains of protosul-
phate of iron, recently crystallized, transparent, and of a
light green colour, were dissolved in boiling-hot distilled
water, after it had been kept boiling briskly for several
