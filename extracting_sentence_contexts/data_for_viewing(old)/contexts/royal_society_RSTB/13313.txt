What follows from this for the task of delineating biological Danchin ef al. [35] distinguish between genetic, epige-

different modes of inheritance within the channel of cultural channels that they distinguish by pointing to vertical versus
inheritance. Yet, their argument can also be used to strengthen non-vertical transmission modes (figure 2).
