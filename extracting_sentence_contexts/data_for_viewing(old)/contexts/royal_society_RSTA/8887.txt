and these deviations should be in the direction indicated by the discrepancy shown
by the diagram. It should be pointed out that the only quantity which can be arbi-
trarily varied in fitting the theoretical curve to the experimental points is the single
parameter T. The only other variable entering is the stretch dV, which is already
fixed by the way in which the experimental points are reduced from the observational
data. Given T and dV, the value of the ordinate for any particular value of V is deter-
mined absolutely.

I believe that the data exhibited in fig. 18 furnish strong evidence that the distribu-
tion of energy among the chemically emitted electrons is of a very simple character
and is identical with that which would be possessed by the molecules of a gas at a certain
definite temperature. The fraction where kinetic energy lies between uw and u + du
appears, in fact, to be given by

For COCI, acting on NaK, the value of T appears to be close to 3600° K. The evidence
would, of course, be stronger if it were unequivocally supported by the analysis of
figs. 4 and 7. It may be that too much emphasis is being laid on the uncertain data
and the disturbing causes which affect curves I. and II. of fig. 17. It may be that
