Hippopotamus have been found on the north-west side of the Lasethe Mountains,

These facts prove how prolonged earth movements have been in this area. They
show also that drift deposits of the same character as we have noticed in Greece and
Malta are clearly traceable thus far eastward.

marine deposit with recent species of Ostrea and Cardium, at a height of about —
40 feet above the present sea-level ;* and SrrickLaNpDt says that a thick mass of

but he gives no details. t
