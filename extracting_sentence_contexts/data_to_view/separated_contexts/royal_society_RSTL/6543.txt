Likewise the movement
from 8 A.M. to 2 P.M. will be, at every point in the periphery, from the magnetic east to
the magnetic west, whilst geographically it will have every possible diversity. It is obvious that what is here stated of points taken in the periphery of the circle is
equally true of every point taken in the interior of the circle, until the point of 90* of
dip is 80 nearly approached as to render the horizontal magnet absolutely astatic. The facts of the solar-diurnal variation at Port Kennedy and Point Barrow, after the
elimination of the larger disturbances, furnish a practical exemplification of the justice
of this description in all its details.


662 MAJOR-GENERAL SABINE ON THE RESULTS OF HOURLY OBSERVATIONS

The magnitude of the disturbance-diurnal variation at Port Kennedy and Point Bar-
row, compared with that of the solar-diurnal variation about the hours when the diurnal
inequality (which is the resultant of the two variations combined) is at its extreme
eastern and western limits, affords an instructive example to those who employ the mage
nitude of the diurnal range in different years as a means of tracing the epochs of maxi-
mum and minimum of the magnetic variation in the decennial period. Referring to
Table IV., we find that at 8 A.M., the usual hour in Europe of the easterly extreme of
the diurnal inequality, that extreme is augmented at Port Kennedy by a disturbance-
deflection amounting, on the average of the five months during which the observations
were maintained, to above 15' easterly ; whilst at 2 P.M., the usual hour of the westerly
extreme, there is the counteracting influence of a disturbance-deflection, which is still
easterly, exceeding 30', Now, as both these yalues, 15' and 30', yery considerably exceed
the ordinary deflections caused by the regular solar-diurnal variation, either to the East,
at 8 A.M. or the West at 2 P.M., it is obvious that, at stations where the energy of the
disturbing force is considerable, the magnitude of the diurnal range at such station:
must be mainly influenced by and dependent on the amount and hours of the disturbance:
diurnal variation. Indeed, when we duly consider the extreme liability to variation in
these last-named circumstances, we shall be prepared to find that, as magnetical researches
are extended, stations present themselyes where the effect of the increase of the amount
of disturbance at the epochs of maximum of the decennial period is to cause the com-
bination of the two variations to exhibit in such years a decrease instead of an increase
in the magnitude of the diurnal rangeâ€”actually causing the epochs of maximum and
minimum in the cycle to apparently change places with each other; in s8uch cases the
minima of the range of the diurnal inequality will coincide with the maxima of the
sun's spots and of the magnetic disturbances ; whilst other stations will be found where
the difference between the epochs will be apparently increased in amount ; and others
where it will be obliterated, and no cycle be traceable by this method of inquiry.

'The method of tracing the epochs of maximum and minimum of the decennial period
by a comparison of the aggregate values of the disturbing action in different years, as
shown by the separation and analysis of the disturbances themselvyes, is not subject to
the inconvenience which has been thus noticed: it has also the advantage that the pro-
portionate increase in the amount of disturbance between the epochs of maximum and
minimum, 2-5: 1 (St.
