True irreversible prospective value can only be tested by
interchange experiments. But if segregation is limited to being the process of origin
of parts possessing irreversible prospective value as tested by interchange experiments,
it becomes identical with determination, and it loses the first element mentioned above,
namely, that it is responsible for the origin of parts with new potentialities. Such new potentialities do in fact arise. Consider a single-stage process of differentia-
tion of a piece of tissue ; for example, the differentiation of neural plate from blastula
ectoderm in Triton. At first the blastula ectoderm is quite indifferent as regards this
process, later it is definitely determined either to become neural plate or not ; only in
the middle period does the differentiation to neural plate exist as an undetermined
potentiality.
