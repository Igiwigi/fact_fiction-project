Healthy soils are broadly defined / pathogen examples in:

diversity’ [40]. Much of the emphasis in soil health

assessments has been placed on soil organic carbon, nutrient long Fusarium Bacillus

cycling, soil structure and water relations, and general term oxysporum anthracis
microbial activities. Most existing conceptual frameworks or

tools for soil health do not directly consider suppression of short Xantho- Salmonella
detrimental organisms to plants and humans [41], despite term monas enterica

the fact that suppressiveness is often an additional benefit
of practices targeting other soil health indicators. Two decades ago, van Bruggen & Semenov [42] proposed
considering incidences of plant and animal disease as symp-
toms of an ecosystem in poor health. They argued that the Long-term presence is necessary for pathogen—antagonist interactions that

ability of the biological community to suppress or reduce generate specific suppression; by contrast, pathogen presence is not required 9,

populations of pathogens (e.g. ‘disease suppression’) is an for antagonist—antagonist interactions that contribute to general suppression =
important indicator of a stable and healthy soil ecosystem.
