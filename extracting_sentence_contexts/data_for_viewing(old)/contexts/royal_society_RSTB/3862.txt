2. Reduction phenomena are exhibited in—

(a) Dicliny, or separation into flowers bearing transitory microsporophylls only,
and more permanent seed-producing ovulate flowers.

(8) In the diminished number of members produced, ¢.e., a teridency to a minimum
in member-production.

(y) An associated reduction of phyllotaxis-construction may also follow, giving
systems of cycles with fewer members per cycle ; but since a practical limit
had been already attained in the vegetative shoot, though it must not be
supposed that floral shoots necessarily follow, the fact remains that these
present a tendency to decussate construction, which is quite definite so far
as the inflorescence-system is concerned ; though extending as far as the
perianth, there is no evidence that it was ever continued into the
sporophylls.

(5) On the other hand, in the condensation of the older strobili to cones with
reduced surface, the number of flowers is not markedly reduced, but they
then necessarily become “ flattened,” as also do the subtending bracts.

3. Of the two flowers, the functional ovulate flower clearly retains least of the
general ancestral characters, just as it has to stand the more exhaustive strain of
seed-production. It is reduced to a minimum construction containing nothing which
