It is in this manner that the
neryous structure appears to be elongated forwards for the enlargement of particu-
lar parts. The cords in the abdomen recover their original direction, but are not
much increased in diameter, and the sixth and seventh ganglia entirely disappear,
while the ganglia and nerves in the thorax are enlarged, and aggregated into two
masses ; the crura of the cerebral ganglia are much shortened, and the optic nerves
are at the same time proportionably developed. From these facts we may conclude,

that it is by an elongation forwards and outwards in every direction,—by the approxi-
mation of nervous trunks already formed, —and by the interweaving, exchange, and
recombination of filaments into new trunks, that the development of the nervous
system in insects is completed.
