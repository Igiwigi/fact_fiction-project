(ii) System operation

The effect of the transmission network is characterized by a linearized power flow model.
Equation (3.7) models the first Kirchhoff’s law for nodal injections and withdrawals, whereby the
sum of power inputs is equal to the sum of power outputs in a node. Power flows through a line
can be decomposed into a transfer contribution from the line itself and another from its FACTS
device (if installed) as shown in equation (3.8) (this is known as the power injection model of a
FACTS device [73]), and the total transfer is limited by the capacity of the line (see equation (3.9)).
Equation (3.10) shows that FACTS devices (in this case a quad-booster phase-shifting transformer
[73]) also have limited capability to shift power. In addition, equation (3.11) represents the second
Kirchhoff’s law, where a disjunctive, big-M-based model [74] is used for new lines, ¥ being
a sufficiently large positive constant. For existing network infrastructure, we can assume that
Hin = Mery =1 in all equations. Similarly, for those lines where there are no candidate FACTS


devices (i.e.1 ¢ £2), we assume ue 0 and, therefore, fe 0:
