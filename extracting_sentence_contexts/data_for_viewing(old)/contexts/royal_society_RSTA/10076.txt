(Table VIL).

There is little doubt that the graphitised surface of the ingot, referred to in a
preceding paragraph, is a result of the recombination of the carbon monoxide. The
instant the power is cut off, the temperature of the molten mass begins to fall rapidly,
and it is during this period that the back reaction chiefly occurs. As soon as the
product has frozen, further attack is limited, for the mgot of carbide is of a very
compact and impermeable texture, and is protected by the graphite film.

Such a “skin reaction” would doubtless become predominant were the experiments
carried out on a few grammes of material, but when dealing, as we are here, with
larger quantities, the total loss is too small to influence appreciably the result. This
is shown by the fact that the yield is not increased when the carbon monoxide is let
off immediately upon stopping (¢f. Table III., C 26).

The further question, as to whether the presence of an atmosphere of carbon
monoxide during the run has an unfavourable effect on the efficiency of the process,
is also answered in the negative by a comparison with furnaces operated at
atmospheric pressure, but otherwise under identical conditions.

These unexpected results called for more detailed study, and a number of
experiments were undertaken in which provision was made for carrying away the
carbon monoxide as soon as it was formed. The first method which suggested itself
was to remove the gaseous products of reaction by dilution with some inert gas,
which was alternately introduced and discharged, the pressure in the furnace being
