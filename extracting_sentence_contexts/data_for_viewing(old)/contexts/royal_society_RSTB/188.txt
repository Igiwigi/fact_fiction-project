wards by the body wall, externally by the mesocardium laterale, and internally by the
splanchnopleure, where that membrane is closing in behind the venous end of the
heart to form the fore-gut and mesocardium posterius (figs. 16B and 200, It. Va

x Behind the heart and vitelline veins the splanchnopleure has not as yet infolded to
a form the alimentary canal, but runs outwards on either side to unite with the somato-
3 pleure (figs. 178 and 188, Spl.). Longitudinal sections near the axis of the embryo
E and internal to the iter show the heart in its relation to the pharynx (figs. 134 and
& 144), and their appearances have been rendered familiar by KÃ©ttrKer,} Uskow, and
g others. Taken alone, they suggest that the heart lies in a separate and distinct
g chamber of its own; but such an idea is shown to be erroneous, both by earlier
= embryos and by the other sections through the iter. The appearance seems due to
% the fact that in the cardiac region the halves of the ccelom have already coalesced,
2 whilst behind they are still apart ; so that, in consequence, the splanchnopleure which
ES spreads outwards from one to the other envelops the venous end of the heart
EB (fig. 144), and thus seems to form a closed chamber for it.

2 Soon after the heart has become an unpaired organ the ventral wall of the cardiac

chamber alters so much that the share the splanchnopleure has in its formation is
less obvious. It seems reasonable to infer that, inasmuch as its ventral boundary wall
is covered with hypoblast, therefore it is of splanchnic origin, and this is borne
out by the younger embryos (figs. 1 to 8, Hy.). In longitudinal sections, as VAN
BeNEDEN and JULIN also show, the hypoblast extends forwards over the ventral wall
of the cardiac ccelom to form, with the epiblast, the pro-amnion (fig. 5, P. am.).
