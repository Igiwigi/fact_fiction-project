rudiment of the copula, and this tissue persists as a ligament in later stages connecting
the copula with the glottal or laryngeal cartilages. These cartilages are presumably
to be regarded as the rudiments of the cricoid cartilages, and the question therefore
arises as to whether they are derived from the visceral arch skeleton or not. The question is complicated by the fact that in the mammal, the cricoid cartilages,
if they represent visceral arches at all, must correspond to the fourth branchial arch ;
in the bird, coming immediately after the first branchial arch, they would correspond
to the second. Here, again, a detailed study of the crocodile seems the most likely
method of settling the matter, and all that can safely be concluded from the present
state of knowledge is the possibility that the second branchial arch of the bird is pei
sented in the glottal cartilages. The birds are the vertebrates in which the visceral arch skeleton is the least well
developed, and this may be associated with the fact that the syrinx has superseded the
larynx in importance.
