Received December 7,—Read December 21, 1865.

Taz fact pointed out in my report ©* On the Chemical Nature of Alloys” *, that their
physical properties may in this respect be divided into two classes, namely (1) those
which do not indicate their chemical nature, and (2) those which do indicate their
chemical nature, has led me to investigate the property of expansion by heat, s0 as to
find the law which regulates the expansion of alloys, as well as to determine to which
of the above classes this property belongs.

To do this, it was first necessary to determine the coefficients of expansion of the
metals to be employed in making the alloys; and in carrying out this research, it had
to be borne in mind that bars of a sufficient length to determine the linear coefficients
of expansion with accuracy would require very large quantities of the pure metals
to'make the alloys, in fact such quantities as it would be impracticable to prepare. A
method had therefore to be devised by which the expansion of small quantities of the
