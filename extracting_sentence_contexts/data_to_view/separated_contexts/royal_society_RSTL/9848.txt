BEVAN LEWIS ON THE COMPARATIVE

the central olfactory fasciculus, behind by the posterior olfactory fasciculus, and
externally and deeply by the superficial olfactory medulla, and betwixt these boundaries
the fibres pass forwards like the strands of a lyre in relation to its geveral sides—hence
the term by which I have denominated this structure. Tenia semicirenaris—This long arciform band of medullated fibres arising from
the summit of the gyrus hippocampi follows the curved inner surface of the caudate
nucleus through the whole of its course, and consists of superficial and deeper-seated
fibres, the latter connected with the ganglionic structure of the caudate nucleus. Tt,
has been affirmed by numerous authorities that this arciform band terminates in the
descending pillar of the foraix.* That the more snperficial fibres 80 terminate T will
not deny; but I have hitherto failed in these animals to assure myself of the fact. Of
its deeper fibres I can speak with confidence. They not only do not terminate in the
fornix, but, end in two distinet directions, the deepest curving downwards to enter the
anterior perforated space (Plate 49, fig. 12, 2); the fibres above this series arch inwards
and forwards to enter the posterior commissure (Plate 49, fig. 12, 1).
