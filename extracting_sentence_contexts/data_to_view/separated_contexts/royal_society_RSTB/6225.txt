Quite apart from his non-recognition of the existence of two cell-types with distinct
glandular phases in the uterine epithelium, BRAMBELL’s view that the Golgi
apparatus is extruded from the cell is difficult to confirm. He describes a pro-
gressive migration of the nucleus in the ciliated cells, from a central position to one
near the cell membrane, followed, after extrusion of the Golgi apparatus, by a
reversed migration of the nucleus towards the basement membrane, and thus he
assumes that a form of kinetic energy is present in the nucleus. In most gland cells,
quite apart from the fact that so-called nuclear migration is in an opposite direction
to that of secretory elimination, it is more reasonable to interpret the movements
of such cell-structures as occurring under the influence of an increase in volume of
the pro-secretion products. Grroup (1926), in discussing the variable position of
the Golgi apparatus in gland cells, has shown that insufficient attention has been
given to the mechanical effects of an increase in secretory material in the cytoplasm,
on the disposition of associated cell structures. It is not legitimate, apart from
observations on the living cell, to assume that such changes in position depend on an
inherent motility of the cell-structure in question.
