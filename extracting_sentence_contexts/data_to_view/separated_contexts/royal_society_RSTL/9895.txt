A till more notable
diminution in depth occurs outwards, viz.: in extra-limbic regions where this outer
cortical zone measures but '279 mm. in depth. In the cortex of the Pig's brain a
similar fact was noted and is recorded in the table of depths of the cortical layers given
in my former paper.* %

2, Small pyramidal layer.â€”In the upper limbic arc of the brain of Man and of
some of the higher Mammalia I have described the typical formation as that of a five-
laminated cortex. In the same region, however, of the Rabbit's brain the cortex is four-
laminated, and this arises from the absence of the small oval and angular elements which
in Man constitute the second layer.
