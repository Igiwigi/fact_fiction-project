This is 337 cm/s. It can also be observed in this photograph that the leading edge
of the sheet moves a shorter distance. It has, in fact, only the resultant velocity of the
forward velocity minus the contraction velocity, namely, 693 cm/s. It is also seen that
once the particles have left the sheet and are no longer influenced by the contraction
velocity, they have a greater forward velocity, namely, 915 cm/s. Approximate calculations show that the break-up of the threads in our photographs
conforms to Rayleighâ€™s theory of the stability of liquid columns.
