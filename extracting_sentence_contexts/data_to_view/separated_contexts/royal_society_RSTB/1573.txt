In
rovst of the remaining genera, however much they may be modified in other respects,
the walls of the airbladder are structurally complete, and the convergence of the fibres

forming the wntero-lateral, lateral aod dorsal walls of each air-sac to their msertion
into tlie nrescentic process. of the tripus takes place in much the same way as in the
normal Siluride:. There would seen, however, ta be some definite relation between
the extent to which the aiv-bladder retains its structural integrity, and its apparently
finetional connection with the tripodes, and the extent to which it is encapsuled Ivy
bone, When ihe dorsal walls of the air-savs haye undergone more or less complete
degeneration, and have wholly or lavgély lost their normal attachments to the
tripodes, the aiv-bladder is but slightly enclosed within comparatively shallow
Deoesses or grooves on the ventral surfaces of the transverse processes of the fourth and
fifth vertobym, The partial encapsulation in such cases may be simply due to the fact
Ulat reduation in the size of the only portion of the air-bladder that persists, viz., the
auterior chamber, has been accompanied by a, corresponding contraction and curyatore
of the modified transverse processes, which are normally moulded to the convesity of
its anterior and dorsal surfaces. On the contrary, in nearly ull cases in which the air-
bladder retains mach of its structural integrity, and, at the sane time, its anatomical
connection with the tripodes, it is always more completely encapsuled by hone than
when the contrary is the case (eg., Collomystee, Cetopyis, and Clurias). Tn such
instances, the reduced air-bladiler is either enclosed within deep grooye-like recesses
With greatly contracted outer or distal extremities.
