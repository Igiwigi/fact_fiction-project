how ‘diffuse’ the internal structure of each category is in its
sensorimotor grounding. Mean sensorimotor distance per
category ranged in theory from 0 (i.e. all category members
are identical; category is not at all diffuse) to 11.12 (ie. all cat-
egory members share no sensorimotor information; category
is extremely diffuse).

Our exploratory goal in this study was to examine
whether abstract and concrete categories differed in their
level of diffuseness by comparing the distribution of mean
sensorimotor distance per category in each domain.
