Generative models are
for internal (homeostatic and drive) states—can be used to constructs from statistical theory that generate predictions
control bodily movements and external variables, too. This about observations and are widely used in data science and
is illustrated by the use of ‘equilibrium points’ in motor con- machine learning. Here, we are concerned with generative
trol—and the fact that it is possible to guide bodily actions by models as explanations of how the brain works. Active infer-
setting fixed point attractors at desired movement endpoints ence posits that creatures entail generative models of the
[16]. Another illustration of the same principle is the notion of hidden causes (x) of their sensations (y): see figure 2 for a

‘goals’ in cognitive theory [17].
