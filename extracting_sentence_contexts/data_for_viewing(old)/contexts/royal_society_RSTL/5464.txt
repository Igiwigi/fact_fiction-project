Elegant and valuable for certain purposes as are these formulz for Z,,, and r,, they
are affected with the disadvantage of being expressed by means of formule of a
much higher degree in the variable x than really appertains to them, the paradox
(if it may be termed such) being explained by the circumstance of the coefficients
of all the powers of z above the right degree being made up of terms which mutually
destroy one another. Upon the face of the formulte, z,,, and 7, which are in fact
only of the degrees r+1, and 7 respectively in z would appear to be of the degree
1+3+5+...+(2râ€”1), 1.e. of the degree >.

Art. (47.). 1 may add the important. remark, which, does-not appear. to, have
occurred immediately to my friend M. Here when he! communicated-to 'methe

forms, we may dispense with any identification of the successive coaxal determinants
of the matrix to the generating function
