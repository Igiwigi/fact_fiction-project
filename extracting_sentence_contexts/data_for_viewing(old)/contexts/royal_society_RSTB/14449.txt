hippocampal activity patterns may be used to learn, infer

and consider various abstract relations. This in turn would
suggest that functions of the hippocampus that refer to time
or space (such as episodic memory and mental time travel)
may be particular applications of a broader system of imagin-
ation (figure 4) [7,15,17,176]. Notably, this view advocates
that the function of generative neural activity in the hippo-
campus may not be characterized by the strength of its
correlation to immediate behavioural choices, but rather by
its relationships to internal processes [68,113,122,181]. The
contribution of generativity to behaviour may not be immedi-
ate, and in fact might have an indefinite horizon in the
lifetime of subject. This system may be elaborated in
humans, supporting frequent and at times seemingly
undirected flights of creativity and imagination.
