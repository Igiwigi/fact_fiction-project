This suggests
experiments to link up the thermal sensitization with sensitization to impact, and also to
determine how long it persists in the crystals. These are further discussed in subsequent
pages. On the calculation of activation energies from observed induction periods

Calculation of the above values of E may be affected by the fact that samples may not heat
up quite instantaneously in the method described. If the samples take an appreciable time to heat up, the measured induction period will
be longer than the true value at the same temperature. The activation energy is calculated
from the slope of the logarithmic curve, i.e.

dlog Y/dT = â€”E/4-57T?.
