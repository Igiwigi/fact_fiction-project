If, then, the object-glass be not accurately achromatised the one reflector may
be focussed accurately for blue rays and the other for red rays. Thus we should have
one star intrinsically redder than the other. In consequence of these considerations,
we used, whenever we noticed a difference in colour, to mention the fact, in order that
this cause of inaccuracy in the observation might be taken account of, We did not
take particular notice which star was red and which blue, though we sometimes noted
the fact. We had no idea that any information might be gained by always noticing
which star was red and which one blue. On different days the distinetness and steadiness of the stars varied enormously.
