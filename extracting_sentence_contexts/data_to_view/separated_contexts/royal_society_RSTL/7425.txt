S There is no evidence of the conversion of the substance of the outer layer of the pro-
lasm, 7. e. the cortex of the yelk, into yelk-sac, in the sense in which that gradual
@nversion is believed by Dr. Bears to take place in cartilage; at least after arrival
Ss that stage, and it is a very early one, at which the yelk-sac is separable: as then it
gays shows its inner and outer surfaces equally sharp, hard, and distinct. Z There are no facts known to me to point out whether the pabulum for the growth of
is membrane is derived directly from the currents passing inwards, or from the mate-
Sil elaborated in the egg and passing out of it, or from both sources indifferently. Z The extreme delicacy of the film which covers the yelk at first, makes it impossible to
gy positively whether it appertains rather to the layer of cells lining the ovisac, or
ether it is more closely adherent to the yelk ; but 1 incline to the latter view. SThe germinal vesicle, which, both from the facts here recorded, and from the analogy
# the eggs of invertebrata, appears to be formed before the primitive yelk, may be
Spposec, from its disappearing when the egg is ripe, before fecundation, or the action
external agents, to preside over the origin and growth of the egg.
