In all cases, it is absolutely necessary to take the greatest
care that the lights compared be properly trimmed, and that
they burn clear, and equally, otherwise the results of the ex-
periments will be extremely irregular and inconclusive. It is
astonishing what a difference there is in the quantities of light
emitted by the same candle, when it burns with its greatest
brilliancy, and when it has grown dim for want of snuffing. But as this diminution of light is progressive, and as the eye
insensibly conforms to the quantity of light actually present, it
is not always taken notice of by the spectators ;â€”it is never-
theless very considerable, in fact, as will be apparent to any
pne who will take the trouble to make the experiment; and


measuring the comparative Intensities of Light. 71

$0 great is the fluctuation in the quantity of light emitted by
burning bodies, lamps, or candles, in all cases, even under the
most. favourable circumstances, that this is the source of the
greatest difficulties I have met with in determining the rela-
tive intensities of lights by the method here proposed. To ascertain by this method the comparative densities, or in-
tensities of the light of the moon, and of that of a candle, the
moon's direct rays must be received upon a plane white sur-
face, at an angle of incidence of about-60*, andthe candle
placed in the line of the reflection of the moon'srays from this
surface ; when the shadows of the cylinder corresponding to
the moon's light, and to that of the candle, being brought to
be of equal density, by removing the candle farther off, or
bringing it nearer to the centre of the white plane, as the oc-
casion may require, the intensity of the moon's light will be
equal to that of the candle at the given distance of the candle
from the plane. To ascertain the intensity of the light of the heavens by
day or by night, this light must be let into a darkened room
through a long tube, blackened on the inside, when its inten-
sity may be compared with that of a candle or lamp by the
method above described.
