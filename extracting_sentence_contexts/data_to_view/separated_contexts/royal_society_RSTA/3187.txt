In the experimental
protocols used, the clearing electric field was left on during magnet ramp-down to distinguish
populations of trapped antiprotons (which would tend to systematically deflect in accordance
with the direction of the electric field) from antihydrogen atoms (which would tend to annihilate
symmetrically in the trap). The inconsistency between the putative trapped antihydrogen atoms
from the expected annihilation pattern of the antiprotons allowed high certainty on the detection
of the released anti-atoms. In fact, this technique is used by ALPHA to date to qualify all our
trapping protocols against this possible background.


3. Measuring potentials with antihydrogen orbits

In a broader context, this investigation, in distinguishing mirror-trapped antiprotons from
antihydrogen atoms, launched a pursuit of what other physics questions could be addressed
through careful consideration of atom orbits within an ALPHA-like atom trap. Here, we consider
two avenues that can be tackled in this manner: (a) whether antihydrogen atoms have charge and
(b) whether antihydrogenâ€™s acceleration in a magnetic field differs from that of hydrogen.

(a) Antihydrogen charge measurements

The first question in some ways came about as a natural extension of the kind of experiment we
were already conducting.
