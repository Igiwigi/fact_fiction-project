Such math-
ematical developments appear to be relatively complex,
although not out of reach. In spite of the remaining uncertainty about the exact value of
the mutation rate of the Zn-finger domain of PRDM39, there is
no doubt that this rate is one of the highest among all protein-
coding genes encoded by mammalian genomes. Given the
important role played by the mutational input at the PRDM9
locus in the restoration of recombination in the face of ongoing
erosion by dBGC, this empirical fact raises the question of why
the key trans-acting factor of the Red Queen of recombination
turnover happens to have such a high mutation rate in the
first place. An interesting possibility would be that PRDM9
has been co-opted in this intra-genomic Red Queen precisely
for that reason. Altermatively, the detailed genetic structure of
the Zn-finger domain could have been progressively optimized
through a higher-level evolutionary process.
