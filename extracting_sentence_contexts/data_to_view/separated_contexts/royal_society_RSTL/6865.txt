1 volume of iron-gold alloy, containing 27-93 per cent. iron, will therefore lose 31-808

On comparing the values obtained for the conducting-powers, &c. of the iron-gold
alloys, the following facts are worth mentioning,â€”their very low and almost identical
conducting-powers, and the high percentage decrements found for the first two and the
low one for the third. That there was no error in this value we convinced ourselves by
remaking the alloy, which contained, according to analysis, the same percentage amount
of iron as that given in the Table, and the percentage decrement in its conducting-power
was found equal to 4:04. Again, an alloy, made by a well-known firm *, which gave on
analysis 11:94 yolumes per cent.
