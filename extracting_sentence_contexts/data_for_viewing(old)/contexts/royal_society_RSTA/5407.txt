1. Background

Sir Christopher Wren is widely acknowledged as a key individual in the formation
of the Royal Society, a society initially advocated ‘for the promotion of physico-
mathematical experimental learning’. Many people would not be surprised to
earn that England’s most famous architect was a driving force behind the
Royal Society. But most people would not know that Wren was at that time
an astronomer.

Astronomy is a field of science that depends on ‘physico-mathematical
experimental learning’. It is a field that critically requires the construction of
yioneering experimental equipment. In fact, since the establishment of the Royal
Society, the equipment demands of astronomers have continually tested man’s
engineering capabilities. Undoubtedly, astronomy is one of the major forces to
oush the frontiers of precision engineering, today, engineering nanotechnology
applied to meso-sized and large ultra-precision optical components. The
application of metrology, today micro- and nano-metrology, to manufacturing
orocesses is a key element of ultra-precision engineering.

Ultra-precision engineering is, however, a key enabling driver behind many
fields of science from astronomy/astrophysics and nanoscience to healthcare.
All too often, perhaps understandably, these engineering achievements are
1idden behind headline scientific findings and techniques. The wider relevance
of these engineering achievements, those which today enable modern devices,
