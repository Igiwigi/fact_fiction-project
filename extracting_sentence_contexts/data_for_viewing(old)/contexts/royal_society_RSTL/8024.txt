importance of careful stowage must be fully realized, as well as the connexion whi;
should subsist between the ship's form and the distribution of her weights. Some
existing views have been shown to be erroneous,â€”notably those respecting the effect of
an excess of weight amidships, and the poxition of the section of maximum strain. The
classification T have adopted for ships is confessedly imperfect; but no general laws
can possibly be laid down to include the very varied characters of the distribution of
weight and buoyancy in all ships, and the types I have chosen have at least the merit of
including a very large proportion of the cases met with, besides permitting a generality
of investigation such as has not been previously attempted.

In attempting to approximate to the shearing- and bending-strains of ships at 8a, we -
meet with a problem of great difficulty, and one which in the present state of our know-
ledge does not admit of complete or exact solution ; in fact it may be doubted whether |
the very varied and rapidly changing conditions of strain in ships s situated will ever be
completely expressed in mathematical language, and brought within the range of accu-
rate calculation, in the same way as still-water strains have here been treated. It is,
however, possible to distinguish the principal causes of straining in ships at sea, and
in 80me cases to make approximations to what may be considered as their limiting
values, as I shall show further on ; but the dynamical aspect of the question, although
the most important of all, is at present in s0me respects beyond our power, 80 far as its
expres8ion in guantitative form is concerned. That this is the case will be obyious on
the most cursory glance at the condition of a ship in a sea-way. Neglecting, for the
sake of simplicity, all consideration of rolling motion, and supposing the ship to lie
directly bow on to the waves, the passage of each wave along her length establishes, or
tends to establish, a vertical motion in the ship as a whole (except under certain special
