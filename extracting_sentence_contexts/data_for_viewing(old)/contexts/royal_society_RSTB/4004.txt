the triphyllous pedicellarize are likewise of the sort characteristic of this species.
The most important, however, are the globiferous pedicellarize, which are exactly
intermediate in structure between those of H. miliaris and E. acutus. There are
some teeth along the side edges of the end part of the valve (the blade) as in
Li, miliaris, though there are not quite so many as in this species. The end portion
of the valve forms an open furrow, which, however, is much narrower than in
£. miliaris and more like HE. acutus. In E. acutus it forms a tube which is almost
closed. The size of these pedicellarie is more or less intermediate between that ot
both parent forms (see text-figs. 18-20).

The fact that all the ambulacral plates carry a primary spine is of special
importance, as this is a decided H. miliaris character, of which there can be no
doubt. The other characters of a maternal origin are undoubtedly the general
colour of the test and spines and the plating of the buccal membrane. Of these the
colour is never so well marked as in the pure /. miliaris, and when the hybrid is
examined in bright light there is something that suggests even the red colour of
LH. acutus. There is always a certain amount of dark brown pigment, shown in
figs. 105 and 107, which is never present in /. miliaris ; it is undoubtedly of paternal
