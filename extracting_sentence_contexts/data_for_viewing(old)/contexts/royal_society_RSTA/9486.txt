It had not been the practice to commence the H observation at a fixed hour, and

the time required for the deflection experiment varies somewhat according as

observing conditions are more or less favourable. Still in most months the mean
times of the vibration and deflection experiments fell so nearly at fixed hours that
one might have applied the same correction to each observation, basing it on a mean
time from all the observations. As a matter of fact, however, this simplification was
not adopted when dealing with the 11 years 1890 to 1900, After 1900, as already
explained, magnetic conditions were less favourable at Kew. Still electric tram
disturbances are, on the whole, of a nature calculated to impair the accuracy of
individual observations rather than that of the arithmetic mean of a number of
observations. It thus appeared worth while investigating the annual inequality
deducible from absolute observations made in years subsequent to 1900.

As corresponding diurnal inequalities from ordinary days were not available, the
corrections applied to the absolute observation results to bring them to the mean value
for the day were based on the inequalities of the years 1890 to 1900. In the case
of H, the years 1901, 1902, 1903, 1910, 1911, 1912, and 1913, having a mean sunspot
frequency of 8°8, had corrections applied from Table VII. ,which is based on the years
