was given over to a summary of the 1883 paper. Before that Lord Rayleigh, in his 1884 presidential
address to the British Association in Montreal, likewise commended Reynolds’ discoveries and
added: ‘In spite of the difficulties... we may hope to attain before long to a better understanding
of a subject which is certainly second to none in scientific as well as practical interest.’

2. The 1895 paper: the referees’ perceptions and the author's response

A full decade was to elapse before Reynolds felt ready to respond to Lord Rayleigh’s observation
that, while his experimental results were valuable, there was a need for a theoretical explanation.
Finally, on 24 May 1894, Reynolds read the outcome of his protracted considerations to a meeting
at the Royal Society. Shortly before that date he had had copies of his paper printed and had
forwarded a number of them to the editor of Philosophical Transactions to be considered for
publication. In fact, Lord Rayleigh had in the meantime become the editor of the journal and,
naturally, he sent the paper for review to Sir George Stokes, who, having completed his term of
office as President of the Royal Society, had returned to normal academic life. This time, however,
unlike his enthusiastic review of the 1883 paper, Stokes, at the age of 75, was both equivocal and
perplexed. Figure 1 shows a photograph of his typed letter of 31 October, a classic example of
sitting on the fence. While his concluding sentence seems to imply that his responsibilities had
been discharged, however inadequately, Rayleigh had other ideas. But on 5 December, Stokes
