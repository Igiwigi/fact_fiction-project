Hrly, our Kilbrew water (one of the ſharpeſt and
moſt ſtrongly faturated with martial vitriol of all
theſe waters yet diſcovered), in the notable cure of
an aſcites, complicated with a jaundice, which T
have elſewhere related; and I fee no reaſon why
phyſicians ſhould not, in this as well as other caſes,
avail themſelves of the happy ſucceſs of ſuch caſual
experiments. In order, therefore, to promote a view of this
kind ; and, furthermore, as theſe vitriolic waters are
better adapted for uſe than the ordinary chalybeates,
as bearing carriage to remote places, and may be
kept fit for uſe at all ſeaſons of the year, . and are to
be preferred in medical intentions, whenever the
ſtrongeſt of the chalybeates are required, and can be
borne ; I ſhall here, from facts and obſervations made
on the ſeveral waters of this ſort, which have fallen
under my notice, give a ſhort ſketch of their general
operation and good effets, as a foundation for fur-
ther improvements,

Theſe waters, then, generally operate as an emetic
or cathartic, or both ; and have recommended them-
ſelves, in external and internal uſe, as a powerful de-
tergent, repelling, bracing, ſtyptic, cicatrizing, anti-
Tcorbutic, and deobſtruent medicine, as hath ap-
peared by the notable cures they have effeted, not
only by external uſe in inveterate ulcers, the itch;
mange, ſcab, tefterous eruptions, ſcald head, and
fore eyes; but alſo by internal uſe in hot tetterous
eruptions, dyſenteries, internal hemorrhages, in
gleets, the fluor albus,. and diarrhza, in the worms,
agues, dropfſies, and jaundice,

Such

Such hath been the ſucceſs, that has not unfre-
quently crowned the empirical uſe of theſe waters ;
which, though, in ſome of theſe caſes, it might un-
doubtedly have been better conducted in the hands of
the prudent phyſician, may, however, ſuffice to con=
vince us, that the vitriolic waters are a branch of the
materia medica, not to be deſpiſed nor overlooked,
in the cure of many ſtubborn chronical diſeaſes,
