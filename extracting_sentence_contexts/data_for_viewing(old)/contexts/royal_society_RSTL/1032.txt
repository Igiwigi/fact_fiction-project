Ship guns on board the ships of war in which I made my pas-
sage to and from America,

It would take up too much time, and draw out this paper
to too great a length, to give an account in detail of all these
experiments, and of the various observations I have had oppor-
tunities of making from time to time, relative to this subject.
I shall, therefore, only observe at present, that the result of all
my inquiries tended to confirm me more and more in the
opinion, that the theory generally adopted relative to the ex-
plosion. of gunpowder was extremely erroneous, and that its
force is in fact much greater than is generally imagined. That
the position of Mr. Ropins, which supposes the inflammation
and combustion of gunpowder to be s0- instantaneous « that
« the whole of the charge of a piece of ordnance is actually
« inflamed and converted into an elastic vapour before the
* bullet is sensibly moved from its place,” is very far from
being true; and that the ratio of the elasticity of the generated
fluid, to its density, or to the space it occupies as it expands,
is very different from that as8umed by Mr. Rozins.

The rules laid down by Mr. Rozins for computing the ve-
locities of bullets from their weight, the known dimensions of
the gun, and the quantities of powder made use of for the
