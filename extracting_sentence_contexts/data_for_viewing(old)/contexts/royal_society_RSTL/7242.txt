SIR B. C. BRODIE ON THE CALCULUS OF CHEMICAL OPERATIONS. 785

the world of chemistry on which the attention may adyantageously be concentrated.
Ordinary language is too vague and too diffuse for the purposes of science, and in
chemistry especially the facts are 80 numerous and s0 complicated that it is only when
embodied in a concrete form that they can be stored in the memory, and become the
object of reflection. Hence even an imperfect and material picture may, in a certain
epoch of the development of the science, be found of indispensable utility.

The actual theory of chemistry may be regarded as an expansion of the hypothesis of
DaLron. In science, as in other s8pheres of thought, hypotheses often pass without
question which come to us recommended by early use, and by even a $hort tradition ;

S and when embodied in symbolic language, and thus intimately blended with our con-
AQ ceptions, they are readily mistaken for facts. No statement, perhaps, would receive
S more universal or unqualified assent from chemists than that the molecule of ammonia
T contains three atoms of hydrogen, that ethylamine is derived from ammonia by the
