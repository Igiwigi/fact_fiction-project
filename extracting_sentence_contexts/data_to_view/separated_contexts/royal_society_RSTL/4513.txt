HansrTeen, Erman and Dus ; and we may gather the result
from the following passage in M. Erman's © Reise um die Erde, which I quote from
Mr. Coorey's translation, vol. ii. p. 365 :—© The magnetical results of the last jour-
ney were now examined more narrowly, and it was clear that we had in fact crossed
the meridian of the Siberian magnetic pole between Irkutsk and Yakutsk. The mag-
netic attraction of the earth was decidedly greater between Kirensk and Beresovoi
Ostrov than at any other point which we had visited in the same parallel of latitude
to the east or west. The pole songht for had there exhibited its greatest force, and
extended its influence furthest to the south ; and consequently we must have been
there on the same meridian with it.
