This
was only over a small area of about + of a square inch in dimensions, enough to yield a
single microscopical preparation. From a very large quantity of the coral prepared in
an exactly similar manner, no second preparation could be obtained, though it was all
searched over carefully for similarly expanded zooids. 'This fact, however, shows that
perhaps it might have been possible to obtain a larger quantity of expanded zooids in
the hardened condition by the gradual addition of alcohol or fresh water to the s8ea-
water in which the living animals were expanded, or by some similar means; or
perhaps by sndden addition of osmic-acid solution as recommended by F. EK. ScruLzEÂ®. The body of the zooids, when seen in transverse section, is found to consist (fig. 15)
of an ectodermal layer, beneath which is a layer of membrane, and an internal mass of
endodermal cells.
