Oxrmanns. The positions of the nuclei are determined by their mutual repulsion,
and cell walls are formed in dense protoplasmic layers, which at an early period
delimit the mass of each oosphere. When walls are formed they do not at once
extend through to the oogonial periphery—only later do they join the innermost
gogonial layer of the wall.

\ The oogonial wall is differentiated, except about the region of the basal pit, into
rst two, and later into three membranes, which we proposed to designate as eno-,
eso- and endo-chite. The meso- and endo-chite are not distinguishable until a later
Period. The liberation of the eggs is accompanied by mucilaginous change in the
Buyers of the wall.
ic Sometimes eggs are found containing more than one nucleus. These have given
Bese in the past to erroneous views as to the facts of fertilisation. Sometimes, also,
the oospheres retain the inner layers of their walls, and then present an appearance

5 The biological part played by mucilage in the process of extrusion of the oospheres
i considerable, and reference may be made to the body of the paper for details.
Z Normally only one antherozoid enters each oosphere, although cases of polyspermy
go occur. The case of Halidrys is especially interesting, as shedding some light on
“the nature of the process. Groups of antherozoids are attracted to the unfertilised
Sees, and after fertilisation is effected, a definite repulsion is witnessed between the
age and the unsuccessful antherozoids. ‘The new influence upon the latter may even
Sntail lethal consequences.
3 Fertilisation in healthy material occurs with great rapidity, and the fusion of the
