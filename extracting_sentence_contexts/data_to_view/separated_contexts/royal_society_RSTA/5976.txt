The average difference between the two instruments is © 2.2% with
a standard deviation of 3.0%. The results are promising for the future experiments as they show
that the results obtained from the instrument's prototype are similar to the results obtained from
the commercial instrument. The factor that could influence the measurement of the peak’s wavelengths is the fact that
the raw data from the prototype needed to have a smoothing applied to them to filter the
noise over the curve where the data from the commercial instrument were already smoothed. It means that, before smoothing, the signal-to-noise ratio of the prototype is smaller than that of
the commercial instrument's direct output. However, the number of data points of the prototype


was higher than those of the commercial instrument over the bandwidth of interest resulting
from the higher resolution of the prototype versus the commercial instrument.
