Thus,
T(s)(fg) = (A - h)(0) = (A - hy(s) = (TS)f)(T)g),

which shows (a) by density of dom(5) and Theorem 3.1. The equivalence of (a) and (c) immediately follows from Theorem 3.1 and Proposition 3.7. Moreover, uniqueness of gy follows from Theorem 3.1 and the fact that the semigroup is uniquely
determined by its generator. |

4. Attractors and stability: an outlook

Koopman semigroups have proven to be an effective tool to study dynamical systems on compact
spaces. The characterization of these semigroups and their generators on spaces C)(X) can
be the starting point to extend the Koopman theory to a more general framework, thereby
allowing for an approach to nonlinear systems arising from partial differential equations based
on linear functional analysis and operator theory.
