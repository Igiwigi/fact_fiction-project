On simple Yoltaic Circles.

875. 'Trr great questjon of the source of electricity in the voltaic pile has engaged
the attention of s0 many eminent philosophers, that a man of liberal mind and able
to appreciate their powers would probably conclude, although he might not have
studied the question, that the truth was somewhere revealed. But if in pursuance of
this impression he were induced to enter upon the work of collating results and con-
clusions, he would find such contradictory evidence, such equilibrium of opinion,
such variation and combination of theory, as would leave him in complete doubt re-
specting what, he should accept as the true interpretation of nature: he would be
forced to take upon himself the labour of repeating and examining the facts, and
then use his own judgment on them in preference to that of others,

876. This state of the subject must, to those who have made up their minds on the
matter, be my apology for entering upon its investigation. The views I have taken
of the definite action of electricity in decomposing bodies (783.), and the identity of
the power 80 used with the power to be overcome (855.), founded not on a mere
opinion or general notion, but on facts which, being altogether new, were to my mind
precise and conclusive, gave me, as I conceived, the power of examining the question
with adyantages not before possessed by any, and which might compensate, on my
part, for the superior clearness and extent of intellect on theirs.
