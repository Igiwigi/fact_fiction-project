8. Empirical Formule for the Expansion of Mercury.

An empirical formula representing the first two series was calculated in the first
instance by the method of least squares. This method was adopted by WOLLNER
and Brocu in reducing ReGNautt’s observations, and was fairly appropriate in that
case, because the main source of error lay in measuring the small difference of level
in the gauge. In the present series of experiments, the fact that the difference of

level in the gauge could not be read nearer than 0°001 em. was an important limitation
of accuracy at low temperatures, when the difference of level was small. But at
temperatures between 200° C. and 300° C., where the difference of level was 40 to
60 em., the possible errors in the measurement of the length and temperature of the
hot columns became more important, and the order of accuracy was limited in a
different way, namely, as a fraction of the whole quantity measured. For low
temperatures, the differences between the observed and calculated values of the
expansion itself were the best criterion of accuracy ; but for high temperatures, the
