Khasia plateau, mnst drive the compensating equatorial current into a higher region of
the atmosphere, and the registers of the station show that in the cold-weather months
the preponderating winds at this station are from the north.

The Shillong registers show further that, as compared with Goalpara, the humidity of
the tation is low. Except in February and December and from July to October, when
it is equal to that of Goalpara (in the last month somewhat higher), the mean humidity
of the hill-station is from 1 to 5 per cent. less than that of the As8am valley. A similar
relation is 8hown, but far more decidedly, by Hazareebagh, which from October to May
has a drier atmosphere, not only than Calcutta and Cuttack, but even than Patna, 120
miles further inland: from October to April its humidity ranges below that of Jubbul-
pore, although it is less than 700 feet higher. TI should not indeed venture to infer
from this fact that in a yertical column of the atmosphere over the plains the relative
humidity of the atmosphere would be found in the cold and early hot-weather months
lower than near the land-surface, to any thing like the extent shown by the Hazareebagh
registers. The situation of this station on the highest part of a dry plateau, freely
absorbing and emitting the solar heat, while it affords little evaporation, presents condi-
tions very different from thoge of the free atmosphere ; and probably by raising the tempe-
Tature raises the tension of saturation, while it raises that of the vapour actually in the
air only in about the same ratio as that of dry air. But I have already noticed this
snbject in a previous part of this paper.

In a paper published in 1870 in the 39th volume of the Journal of the Asiatic Society
of Bengal, I gave 'Tables of the average monthly rainfall at 47 stations in Bengal, Behar,
Orissa, Assam, and on the Arakan coast. In Table VI. (at end) these have been corrected
