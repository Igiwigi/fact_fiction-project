the Goodwin, she struck on. the north-eastern extremity of
the southernmost of those sands. And this difference between
the reckoning (after due allowance being made for the tides)
and the actual position, I conclude was owing to the northerly
stream of current, which caught the ship when she drifted to
the back, or eastern side of the Goodwin.

The fact of the high level of the Channel, during strong
winds, between the W. and SW., cannot be doubted : because
the increased height of the tides in the southern ports, at such
times, is obvious to every discerning eye. Indeed, the form
of the upper part of the Channel, in particular, is such as to
receive and retain, for a time, the principal part of the water
forced in; as may be seen by the sketch (No. 2): and as a
part of this water is continually escaping by the Strait of Dover,
it will produce a current ; which must greatly disturb the
reckonings of such ships as navigate the Strait, when thick
weather prevents the land, or the lights of the Forelands, and
the North Goodwin, from being seen.
