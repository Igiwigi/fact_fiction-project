35* W. and 54* 8.; of its vegetation nothing is known except for the scanty obser-
vations recorded in Cook's voyage, which indicate its botanical identity with the
Fuegia. F

Of Bouvet Tsland, the assumed poxition of which is long. 5? B. and 54*8., nothing
is known ; it was searched for in yain by the Antarctic Expedition in 1848. Marion
Island is 37* B. and 46* 8., and the Orozets, in 48 B. and 492 8., are respectively about
1,650 and 1,200 miles west of Kerguelen Island, and there is no land intermediate
between them. Now, from 8nch specimens as haye been obtained of the yegetation
of the firs: of these islands by Mr. Moseley,* it appears to be almost identical
with that of Kerguelen Island ; that is, to be Fuegian with the addition of some of
the peculiar Kerguelen Island types,f and the 8ame remark applies to the Crozets, |
facts from which Mr. Moseley- has drawn identically the same conelusions as those
to which I had arrived thirty-five years previously from a consideration of the Ker-
guelen. Island flora alone. He says, speaking of Marion Island (Linn. Journ. XV.,

* Journ, Liun. Soc. XIV., 387, and XV., 484.
f Marion Tsland contains geveral PFuegian species not hitherto found in Kerguelen Island, namely,
Ranunculus biternatus, Hymenophyllum tunbridgense, and probably a Hierochloe (the scented grass

mentioned by Moseley), together with a Cape fern Aspidium mohrioides and an Agplenium,
