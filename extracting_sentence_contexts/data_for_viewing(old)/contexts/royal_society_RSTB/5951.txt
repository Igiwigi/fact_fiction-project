arose on the anodic side of the wound, and sometimes one arose on the kathodic side.
The former was called I,a and the latter I,k. Sometimes both Ia and 1k arose.

3. Ia and I,k were usually perfect leaves, but often, when the operation was made
late in the I, stage, there arose instead either a bract or an imperfect leaf, of which the
stipule next to the wound was abnormally short. The interpretation is discussed in
sections 7 and 11, and in Part 5.

4. The distances from the wound of the morphological centres of I,a and Ik, when
they were leaves, show that the centres of new leaves can only be determined in positions
that allow room for their stipules. They also indicate that in the Lupin the minimum
area in which a leaf can be determined subtends approximately 124Â°, or perhaps slightly
more. The relevant facts are recorded and discussed in sections 6, 11, 13 and 20, and
summarized in Part 5.

5. In six experiments I,a and I,k both developed as leaves: they were then always
united above the wound.

6. The subsequent phyllotaxis finally returned approximately to the normal type in
all experiments except two (Nos. 30 and 31, section 18), with the genetic spiral winding
either in the original direction or in the opposite. The positions of the successive
leaves have all been readily interpreted on the theory of the first available space, which
they strongly support.

6. The results also show that each leaf is determined as a whole, and that, in the
