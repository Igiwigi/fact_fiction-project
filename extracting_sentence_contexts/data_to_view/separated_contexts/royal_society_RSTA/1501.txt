This conditioning on outcomes and observations violates the theoretical assumptions of forecast
verification methods [21,122].

6. Physical constraints and consistency

As has been demonstrated in other application areas of ML (e.g. [123,124]), NNs can be prone
to learning spurious relationships in data. A purely data-driven model for weather forecasting
might fail to adhere to the underlying physical principles and thus generate false forecasts as
it lacks understanding of the fact that every atmospheric process obeys physical laws described
in terms of conservation of momentum, enthalpy and mass. The incorporation of physical laws
in NNs is becoming a vibrant area of research (e.g. [125-128]) and is now often denoted as
scientific ML. One of the first studies to demonstrate that physical constraints can efficiently reduce
systematic biases in lake temperature predictions, while at the same time enhancing
generalization capability, was Karpatne et al. [129].
