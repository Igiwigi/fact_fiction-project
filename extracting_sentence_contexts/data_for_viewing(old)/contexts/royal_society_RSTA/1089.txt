4. Large-scale turbulent noise prediction

For large-scale turbulent noise source terms, coherent with the average flow and turbulent
pulsation, similar noise source terms can also be found in the MGBK and JeNo methods based on
the Lilley equation, considered as shear noise sources. While both the MGBK and JeNo method
are only modulated as the pulsating quadrupole source, and the average velocity in the source
term is considered to affect only the acoustic propagation as part of the Green’s function solution.

However, the study considers that the large-scale turbulent noise source has a great
relationship with the average flow, which is mainly reflected in the fact that the length scale
of the large-scale turbulent should be larger than the fine-scale turbulence length scale, and
the directivity of the large-scale structure radiation noise is more than that of the fine-scale
turbulence noise. It is obvious. Therefore, the following large-scale turbulence noise source
modelling function is established
