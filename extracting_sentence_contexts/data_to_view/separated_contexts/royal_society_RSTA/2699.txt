The prior theoretical work on radiation were validated through the experimental work by
Hertz [24,25], who proved the existence of electromagnetic waves. The other pioneers in the field
of early work on wireless communication were Bose [26], Tesla [27] and Marconi [28], who worked
on the empirical aspects of generation, transmission and reception of electromagnetic waves. One
of the key findings by Marconi was the fact that radiation efficiency significantly increases when

Figure 1. Symmetry in static charges. (a) The electric lines of force are oriented radially from the centre in a symmetric manner
which illustrates rotational symmetry of the electric potential. (b) The spatial symmetry of the electric field lines appear to be
broken in an electric dipole, however, the mathematical symmetry defined by Gaussâ€™s Law is maintained which is reflected in
temporal symmetry of the associated Lagrangian. (Online version in colour.)

a metallic pole, being used as a transmitting antenna, is held vertically over a horizontal plane
[29]. The current work aims to unify the diverse aspects of radiation explored along theoretical
and empirical dimensions through a common thread based on broken symmetries of force fields.
