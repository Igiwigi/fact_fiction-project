AND VIBRATION OF SHAFTS. 305

should have zero righting moment, and in the second, an infinite righting moment.
In other words, in the one case there would be no tendency to make the pulley
deviate from its natural plane of rotation, and in the other, any such tendency would
be met by an infinite moment tending immediately to right it. In either case, there-
fore—assuming whirling to take place at the speeds given by the limiting values of
ac’—it would whirl in such a manner that the pulley still rotates in a plane perpen-
dicular to the original alignment of the shaft.

In fact, the period of whirling, corresponding to the inferior limit of the speed, is
identical with the natural period of vibration of the light shaft under the given
conditions.

This may be easily proved independently.*

The superior limit is double the inferior limit.

The inferior limit may be taken as a first approximation to the period of whirl.

25. Referring to equation [B], § 23, by giving c/k different values likely to be met
with in practice, we get, for each value of c/k, a relation between o, the angular
velocity of whirl, and c, the overhanging portion. Knowing, therefore, the particular
