252 T. LEWIS ON THE SPREAD OF THE EXCITATORY

in clamping the right division certain branches of the left division are also injured.
The reply to this criticism is to be found in protocols of experiments published
later (p. 267); unless there is very extensive damage or complete transection of the
left division the distribution to the left ventricle as gauged by the extracardial
leads remains unaltered. The second criticism which may be raised is that in several
applications of the clamp the main stem of the bundle is almost certain to suffer some
damage. Asa matter of fact, in one series of my curves 2:1 block was present ;
evidently in this cireumstance the impulse was still of auricular origin, and the
spread was therefore still through the usual Purkinje channels. I possess similar
curves from this animal in which there was no block, but the curves, being tremulous,
were less suitable for measurement, though of the same outline. Criticism applies
chiefly to the other experiment in which complete heart-block was present (fig. 2,
and Plate 18, fig. 12). The reply to this criticism is also that the curves are of the
same form whether complete block is present or not. An experiment performed for
the purpose is illustrated by Plate 18, figs. 18 and 14. In this animal a clean cut
severed the right division of the bundle, and the usual curves were subsequently
recorded (fig. 13); a clamp was now placed on the bundle stem and tightened until -
complete block was obtained (fig. 14). Despite the dissociation of auricular and
ventricular rhythms, the form of ventricular complex remained practically unchanged.
