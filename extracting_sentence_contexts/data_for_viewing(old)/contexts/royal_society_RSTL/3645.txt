No. 8. is the only needle which presents a difference from the other needles exceed-
ing in value a five-hundredth part of the time of vibration. If therefore the magnet-
ism of Nos. 5. 7. 9. 11. 12. and 13, suffered any change in the interval comprehended
by the comparison, the alteration must have taken place to an equivalent amount in
each of the needles: # coincidence the less probable, because they had all been pre-
viously exposed to greater extremes of natural temperature than were experienced at
