We have the following:

a) limg-o0 g~ 4s" Tstable — HSp (q-1/2

(b) limg+oo qe Tunstable =0. Proof. For the first statement, we compute > ay

j=0

Using the Hilbert series of Rn, we may then rewrite the above sum as

=HSr,(q_“)

Note that we use the fact (from theorem 3.3) that for 0 <i < (2g — 2)/3, we have

i w prden-i
in = Ry @Q Qe = Reet” (My n,z,7 Qe)-

For the second part, we let P(z) be the generating function for the partition numbers p(j), and
let Q(z) :=>¢ (ai be the generating function whose jth coefficient is the number of multisets
of size j on n elements. Then

HS, (2) = Qn(2*)P(2’). In particular

dim R2 = y (" + dz ) pli —j) <exp (envi). (4.2)

Since Root Ment, Qo) is defined in terms of the image of a map from R, to cohomology, we
further obtain

«den —2i ;
dim Reet (Mgng Qe) < exp (envi). (4.3)

Of course, when i is odd this group is zero-dimensional.
