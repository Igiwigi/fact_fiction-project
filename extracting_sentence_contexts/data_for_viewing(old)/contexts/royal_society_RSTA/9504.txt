potential and the insensitiveness of the electrometer. Some experiments were supposed
to show that the disturbing effect due to the apparatus and observer was less than
I had anticipated. The outcome was that the special device was laid aside, and
observations were confined to one fixed height, about 1°465 metres above ground level.

AT KEW OBSERVATORY, 1898 TO 1912. 135

Time was not available for elaborate experiments, and suspicions were considerably
allayed by the fact that the values obtained for the potential gradient were fully higher
than the average of those obtained elsewhere.

§3. It was always hoped that an opportunity would present itself for a fuller
investigation, but this did not arise until 1909, when Mr. J. 8. Drves was attached
for a time to the Observatory as student assistant. A number of experiments were
made by Mr. Dines. A horizontal bamboo rod, carried in a groove made in a paraffin
block, was supported on a small platform, attached to the top of a vertical rod. The
vertical rod could slide up and down inside a hollow tube, supported by three tripod

a legs. The height of the bamboo could be altered by sliding the vertical rod or by
altering the stretch of the tripod legs, and the distance to which it projected from the
2 centre of the tripod could be altered by moving it in the groove of the paraffin block.
