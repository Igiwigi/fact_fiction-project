thermal motion. The entropy of a segment, for any specified positions of its terminating
junction-points, is considered to be proportional to the logarithm of the volume of the
rotation-configurational phase-space which it fills. The stored elastic energy of the deformed
rubber arises from the fact that the average entropy of the segments in the deformed state
is smaller than that in the undeformed state. A review of the general physical basis of this
theory has been given by Treloar (1943) and, more recently, by Flory (1944). In applying this model of the mechanism of high-elasticity, Wall (1942, 6) has assumed
that all the chain segments are of equal lengths and that the material is incompressible.
