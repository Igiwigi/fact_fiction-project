Arytenoid very long, five and a third times in the body length, with a compressed
cartilago apicalis in a deep incisura, between prominentie which are not very high.
Anterior and posterior pulvinaria vocalia well developed, the posterior on the ventral
side of the ends of the arytenoids. Cricoid ring complete ; on the cardiac side with a
posterior median expansion; laterally broad and strong, with a slender bronchial
process, directed inwards on the ventral wall of the larynx, bearing a minute branch

and one or two tubercles; ‘ pharyngeal” region very narrow, overlapped dorsally
by the arytenoids, so that it is in fact invisible in a dorsal, or pharyngeal, view ;
articular processes minute, intimately united by syndesmosis to the arytenoids; no
lateral or muscular processes.

Muscles.—M. intermandibularis posterior with the superficial layer undifferentiated,
although anteriorly the deep layer consists of fibres with a postero-medial direction,
almost at right angles to those of the superficial layer.*

* Of. Hyla aurea and Rhinoderma darwinii, in which, however, it is the superficial layer which is thus
differentiated.
