The
winds from north and south, so far from being merely incidental features of the situation,
were actually responsible for the majority of migrants moving always in the same direction,
southwards from shore to lake. This persistent off-shore trend falls into place alongside other observations on insects in
wind, if we assume that the insects respond to the apparent movement of their visible
substrate. There is evidence for that assumption (Kennedy 1940, and Part I), and, if it be
correct, the off-shore trend can be attributed to the fact that the ‘maximum compensatory
height’ is greater over land than over water. In other words, the relative movement
of the ground due to the insects being carried over it by the wind remains sufficiently

ments of flying insects, based on the optomotor theory of behaviour in wind and the observations
of Beall (1941, p. 127) on Danaus plexippus L. Resultant movement is from the land out over the
water, both when the wind (heavy black arrows) is blowing off the land (A) and when it is blowing
off the water (B).
