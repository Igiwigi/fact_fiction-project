Dislocations in cores from a number of glaciers and polar ice sheets have been examined using
XT. Dislocation densities from 1 x 10Â° m? to 1 x 108 m* were observed in ice from the temperate
Mendenhall Glacier in Alaska [106], while ice from cold polar ice sheets generally has dislocation
densities that are barely resolvable [111,112].

As an alternative to XT, the distortion of diffraction spots in Laue X-ray diffraction patterns
can be used to estimate dislocation densities although no information on spatial arrangements
is available. This technique has been used to examine dislocation densities in large grains
from the Vostok (Antarctica) ice core (figure 25) [113]. X-ray diffraction is a useful averaging
technique and can be used to study higher dislocation densities than observable using X-ray
topography. As noted earlier, EBSPs can also be used to observe lattice distortion and rotations
and subgrain boundaries in ice and also provides spatial information in under to understand the
local dislocation activity, although the technique suffers from the fact that the information is only
from the near-surface region (less than 1 pm) [79].

Neutron diffraction of HzO ice is not possible due to the very high incoherent scattering;
however, it can be performed on D20O ice, which behaves similarly to H2O ice. McDaniel et al. [114]
performed the first in situ deformation neutron diffraction experiments on polycrystalline D2O ice
using a specially built deformation apparatus that could apply a constant load while the specimen
was kept cold. They showed that a fibre texture was produced in the direction of the applied load.
Later, Piazolo et al. [115] performed in situ compression experiments on polycrystalline D2O ice
in a neutron diffraction facility equipped with a two-circle Eulerian goniometer. They were, thus,
able to track both the texture and grain size as function of strain for different strain rates.
