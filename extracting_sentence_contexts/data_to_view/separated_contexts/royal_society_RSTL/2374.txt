Why are the failing powers of life
maintained in the organs of the two former classes of functions, after all trace of them
is lost in the last class? To the same conclusions, also, I cannot help thinking the following very simple
train of reasoning might, without the aid of experiment, have led us. Although a
Single fact is often sufficient to establish the truth, when it is once arrived at, we
almost always find others ready to give it their aid. The phenomena of the three classes of functions above enumerated, namely, those
by which our bodies are maintained, those by which the sensorial organs are in-
fluenced by the external world, and those by which they influence it, appear themselyes
snfficient to evince that the agents employed in their production partake of the nature
of that world. Were not this the case, is it possible that the analogy between them
and its phenomena could be such as we find it?
