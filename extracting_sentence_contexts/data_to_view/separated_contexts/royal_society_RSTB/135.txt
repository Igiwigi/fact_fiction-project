The stalk of the ovum of Millepora, to which a similar structure exists in Myrio-
thela (3), simply serves to keep the ovum in its proper position in the canal. It seems
to be sometimes completely withdrawn when the ovum migrates, and to be re-formed
when the ovum comes to rest. It is, in fact, simply a pseudopodium modified to keep
the ovum in its position in the endoderm. The Maturation and Impregnation of the Ovum do not offer any striking pecu-
liarities. The formation of the nuclear spindles was difficult to observe, as my
specimens were not specially prepared for this kind of minute histological investigation ;
but from what I was able to observe in well-stained specimens, with a high power, I
should think that the history of the formation of the nuclear spindles does not differ
materially from what has been described by other authors in other ova.
