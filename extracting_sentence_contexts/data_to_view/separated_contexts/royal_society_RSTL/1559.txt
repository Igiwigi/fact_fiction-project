In a moderately sized ass more than
two drams must be dissolved in the blood before its presence
there can be detected. That the fluid contained in the cells of the spleen is
secreted there, is rendered highly probable, since it is most
abundant while the digestive organs are employed, and
scarcely at all met with when the animal has been sometime
w thout food. The great objection to this opinion is, there being
no excretory duct but the lymphatic vessels of the spleen ; these
however are both larger and more numerous than in any other
organ ; they are found in the ass to form one common trunk,
which opens into a large gland on the side of the thoracic
duct, just above the receptaculum chyli; and when the quick-

s1lver is made to pass through the branches of this-gland,
there is a trunk equally large on the opposite side, which
makes an angle, and then terminates in the thoracic duct, This
fact I ascertained at the Veterinary College, assisted by the
Deputy Professor Mr. SEWELL, and Mr. CLirr. These lym-
phatic vessels are equally large as the excretory ducts of any
other glands, and therefore sufficient to carry off the secretion
formed in the cells of the spleen ; and where a secretion is to
be carried into the thoracic duct, it would be a deviation from
the general plan of the animal economy, were any but lym-
phatic vessels employed for that purpose. It is a strong circumstance in favour of the secretion being

lar circumstances, the thoracic duct being so full as not to
receive their contents.
