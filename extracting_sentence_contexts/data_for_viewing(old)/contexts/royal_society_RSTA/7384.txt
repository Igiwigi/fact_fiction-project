Therefore pal?) = gq al@+igtat J (52)

Now we see from the definition of z that it is proportional to the modulus of the Fourier
transform of the power spectrum W(/) when the frequency is shifted by an amount f. It
is a function of 7 only (it can easily be shown to be independent of /,), and the constant of
proportionality is so arranged that z(0) = 1; also (provided that W(/) is everywhere finite)
z(00) = 0. Now it follows from equation (50) that p,(0) = 1 and p,(co) = 0. Therefore
Pa(7) and z(r) are equal when 7 = 0 or 0. From these facts and equation (52) we deduce
that the equation p,(7) = z?(r) is approximately true for all values of 7. As a matter of fact
the approximation is very close indeed, and the error involved in assuming that it is exactly

paper. The approximate (almost exact) equation can be written
