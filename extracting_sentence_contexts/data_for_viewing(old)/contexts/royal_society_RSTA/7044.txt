mental curves actually show two, though S has more. The band ends of a given curve
must be represented by parabolas with different constants, which are always con-
siderably smaller than that of the parabola representing the low-energy part of the
band. If we were dealing with the N(Z) curves themselves, instead of with the
N,.q(E) curves, we could obtain the values of z and f relating to the different parabolas ;
and these quantities would be inversely proportional respectively to the ‘effective

masses’ of electrons occupying levels in the main body of the band and levels corre-
sponding to points near the various corners of the zone. Since we have to deal with
N,,,(Z), we must correct for the fact that the band ends occur also on the N,(£)
curve, as has already been mentioned. In this way, an estimate of the effective mass
appropriate to any particular band end may be obtained and it is found that values
considerably smaller than the electron mass are obtained in most cases, not only for
the extreme band ends, but for the stronger band ends too. Thus, in the case of Si,
assuming that half of the electrons of highest energy are to be found in the N,,,(£)
band ends, the remainder being f-electrons, we obtain values of 4m for the first, and
about ;'gm for the extreme band end. Fréhlich and Mott (1939) have recently given
evidence for similar low values in the case of polar crystals, and the existence of a low
effective mass when the Brillouin zone is very nearly full is in general agreement with
the results of the work of Jones on metals such as bismuth.

In conclusion, I wish to express my thanks to Professor A. M. Tyndall, F.R.S., for
