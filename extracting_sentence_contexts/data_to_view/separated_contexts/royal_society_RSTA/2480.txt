I find that, in this case also, the ratios of the
quantities recorded as observed currents at different distances are nearly the same
as the square roots of the ratios of the magnetic forces at those distances, as
calculated from Macponaxpâ€™s formula. |

23. From this critical discussion I draw the inference that there is nothing in the
experimental evidence, at present available, to compel us to adopt the view that the
diffraction theory fails to account for the facts. On the contrary, that evidence can
be interpreted in such a way as to support the view that the results of the diffraction
theory accord well with those of daylight observations. Until more complete experi-
mental data are available the question of the success or failure of the diffraction
theory must remain open.
