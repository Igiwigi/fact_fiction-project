At the time of its discovery, the deposit of Locality 1 had been partially exposed at
the head of an abandoned quarry on the north side of a small outlying foothill of
Ordovician limestone. ‘To the north of this hill lies the valley of Laoniuko which in
turn on its north is bordered by hills formed of Carboniferous slates and shales (fig. 31). These geological facts were well known to Dr. AnpERsson, and during his examination
of the talus of loose material fallen into the quarry from the face of the deposit he
was surprised to notice in it some fragments of white quartz, a mineral normally foreign
in that locality. The possible significance of this occurrence immediately suggested
itself to him, and turning to his companions he exclaimed, dramatically, ‘‘ Here is
primitive man, now all we have to do is to find him!” For some weeks in the summer of 1921, and again for a longer period in 1923,
Dr. Zpansky carried on paleontological excavations of this cave deposit.
