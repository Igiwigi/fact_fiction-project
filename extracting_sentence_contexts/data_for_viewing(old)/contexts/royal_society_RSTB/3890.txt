be highly ornamented.

(c) A “high-zonal” period, above (b) and including the Danian. A large
proportion of the ossicles are large, high and not infrequently massive.
Both spine pits and rugosities often disappear, leaving smooth plates.

It must be understood that the line of demarcation between these groups of
species is never sharp. The parallelism which makes the above classification possible

is apparently due to the fact that a number of lineages make their first appearance
simultaneously at the beginning of the Cenomanian and pass through corresponding
approximately synchronous stages.

C. As to Stratigraphy—
(1) That ossicles of Asteroidea can be used by the field worker for zonal
determinations.
(2) That the Asteroid fauna can be made the basis of a zonal classification.

An attempt is made in this paper to give in detail the evolution of only one
characteristic Chalk genus, namely Metopaster, Sladen. It was felt that to
describe in extenso the whole of the new species discovered would overweight the
paper. The remaining genera are therefore only dealt with on broad general lines
