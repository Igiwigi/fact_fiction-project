Q Third pair (figs. 1 and 2)—Oculomotorii—rise from the usnal position on the
Inferior surface of the medulla oblongata. Their origins are covered here by the
Aypophysis cerebri, and there is a slighb interval between them and the posterior end
pf the hypoaria. This fact seems to show that the posterior lobes of these bulies,
Syhich are well developed in the Teleostei, are nob represented in the Plagiostomata.
=> Fourth pair—Trochleares— have also a well-defined and constant superficial origin ;
Jhey invariably emerge from a furrow between the optic lobes and the cerebellum,
:Snarking the point of demarcation between the mid-brain and the hind-brain.
=] Fifth pair (figs. 1, 2, and 3)—Trifacial—arise by two roots in the Rays, one the
Anterior from the side of the crura cerebelli, the other more dorsal from the folds of
he restiform bodies ; these two join together and pass through the foramen into the
Srbit, and immediately join the Gasserian ganglion. E The course of the ophthalmic branch is rather peculiar ; it is derived from the upper
Foot in the foramen, and divides into two branches, one of which passes over and the
ther under the external rectus muscle of the eyeball ; these, uniting again into one
Strunk, pass over the olfactory sac, and emerging through a passage in the car-
Hilage go on to supply the anterior pointed angle of the body.
ha In Acanthias (fig. 3) the trifacial arises by one root only from the lower edge of the
<Srestiform bodies. Tt passes out of the skull through its own foramen, and immediately
Yoins the Gasserian ganglion.
