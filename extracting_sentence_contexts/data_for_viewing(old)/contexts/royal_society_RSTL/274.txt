infusion will remain attached to the wood of the bark, after the
infusion is poured or drawn off, I added a third pound of water
to the first part, and then followed up the infusion on the several
parts, till the three pounds of water, or 80-much of them as could
be separated from the bark, were united in the fifth vessel;

son of bark:*

"To a certain quantity of this infusion, I added a given mea-
sure of the s0lution of glue; which formed an immediate preci-
pitate,that may be separated from the infusion by filtering paper.
When dried, it is a substance formed by the chemical union of
the matter of skin with the tanning principle, and is, in fact, a
powder of leather. By saturating the infusion with the solution
of glue, the whole of the tanning principle may be separated
by precipitation.

Â®* The 5pecific gravity of this infusion was ascertained by an hydrometer whoze
gradations are inverse to those of a spirit hydrometer.
