The expression for Sw? was found in the form of a fraction, of which the denominator
is determinate and the numerator consists of the sum of an infinite series. Nine
terms of this series were computed, namely, a constant term and the contribution of
the eight harmonic terms specified above. I found, in fact, that it would only change
the numerator by about one-twentieth part of itself, if all the harmonics excepting
the zonal ones of degrees 2, 4, 6 had been dropped. The result shows that the square of the angular velocity of the pear is less than
that of the critical Jacobian ellipsoid in about the proportion to 1 â€” $e? to1. On
the other hand the angular momentum of the pear is greater than that of the
ellipsoid in about the proportion of 1+ se?
