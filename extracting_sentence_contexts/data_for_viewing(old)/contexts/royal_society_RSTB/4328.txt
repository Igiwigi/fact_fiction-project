0°63 mm. in length by 0°8 mm. in diameter. They are distinctly lobulated and
contain fairly abundant lymphocytes throughout their matrix. In Stage XX, the two
glands overlap in the middle line and may now be said to have attained their adult
characters (Plate 9, fig. 59, s.tm.). The definitive cortical and medullary zones are
clearly distinguishable, lymphocytes are abundant and many fully formed and
developing Hassall’s corpuscles are present.

The not infrequent occurrence of an epithelial body, structurally identical with
epithelial bodies III and LV, in one or both of the cervical glands of later foetuses as
well as adults of Trichosurus, is a feature of considerable interest, to which reference
will be made later (p. 62).

Remarks on Cervical Thymus.—The facts that in certain Eutheria the ectoderm of
the cervical sinus participates along with the entoderm of the third gill-pouch in the
formation of the epithelial basis of thymus ILI and that it gives origin by itself to the
epithelial basis of an independent cervical thymus gland may now be regarded as
definitely established, thanks to the labours of, amongst others, KastscumnKo (27),
H. Rast (46), ZorrerMan (69), Rupen (50), Nrersrrasz (39).

According to their constitution, it is thus possible to recognise, as ZOTTERMAN
has already done (Joc. cit. p. 528), three categories of thymus glands: (1) a thymus
with a purely entodermal basis, derived from the gill-pouch entoderm, e.g. thymus IIT
in Man, the Rabbit, and many other Eutheria and in the Monotremes, thymus IIT and
IV in Trichosurus, (2) a thymus with a purely ectodermal basis, developed exclusively
‘from the ectoderm of the cervical sinus and forming a gland situated in the neck (the
