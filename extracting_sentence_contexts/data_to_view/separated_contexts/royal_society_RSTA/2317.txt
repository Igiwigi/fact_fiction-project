Although in many cases the buildings have been
progressively demolished, most of the chimneys were kept as sculptures to the memory of the
site’s past industrial history. Once outside ordinary living areas, with the growth of the cities,
these old industrial chimneys, now degraded, are actually part of renovated areas surrounded by
dwellings and service buildings, or placed inside leisure areas, being a threat to the safety of the
surrounding environment. In fact, this ‘new’ positioning of the industrial chimneys in inhabited areas raises important
questions regarding the safety of persons and properties. It requires the verification of the
chimneys safety conditions, which involves inspection and diagnosis actions, as recommended by
international entities, such as the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) [1]. In this context, it also demands the assessment of the geometrical and material characteristics and
structural conservation state.
