Society, TI prepared a representation of one of the photographs of partial phase, 3 feet in
diameter, in which, bearing in mind the well-known fact that there is on the solar disk
a gradual diminution of the intensity of the light from the centre to the periphery, T
Searefully reduced the brightness of the solar crescent in due gradation towards the con-
Sex boundary. In the first instance the background was not painted in, and I expected
Shat when it was completed a brightening would immediately occur. Such, however,
Swas not the case.
= On calling Professor STokss's attention to this failure in producing the phenomenon
>f brightening by artistic means, he suggested that I should renew the attempt by using
Ãž real photograph of the sun and a dark disk for the moon*. On this plan I sneceeded
Zn making eclipse-pictures artificially, which showed the brightening very distinctly.
From these experiments I am inclined to believe that Mr. Arry's explanation is the true
ne, although it is a curious subjective fact that the parts possessing superior illumina-
he exhibit to our perception an extremely bright line, bordering immediately on the
Ylark limb of the moon, while the less bright parts towards the circumference present

2 In order to study other points connected with the photographs, I had made, on glass,
Home enlarged copies, in which the moon's disk was increased in 8ome cases to 9 inches,
An others to 13 inches in diameter. It was found that measurements could be made on
Zhese with considerable accuracy, by means of a graduated beam compass reading to
Hhousandths of an inch, and I had proceeded to some extent in this way, when it

Degatives. The study of the enlarged copies led, however, to a method of producing
Zharts of the prominences with complete fidelity; and the plan will, I think, hereafter
