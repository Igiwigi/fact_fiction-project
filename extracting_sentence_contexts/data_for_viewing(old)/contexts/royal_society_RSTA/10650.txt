majority of instances, however, no boundary is obtainable under these circumstances.

But if at the beginning of such an experiment the concentrations of the two solutions
ave proportional to the transport numbers of the respective cations (or anions), then a
stable boundary results which travels with the current. Such a ratio of concentration
is automatically brought about during electrolysis, when the slower ion follows the
faster, and once this condition is established the margin so produced may be made to
move backwards by altering the direction of the current, and this may be repeated a
number of times without losing the boundary, although its velocity has been proved
by experiment to be less in the backward than in the forward direction, The
stability of this margin is easily understood from the fact that the potential slope in

* For the investigation of acids and bases it is impossible to employ gelatine solutions in the cathode
and anode cells respectively, as these are immediately destroyed by the H and OH ions; for these, there-
fore, a partition of earthenware was substituted at the one end, and in order to prevent as far as possible
movements of the solution through the membrane, the open limb of the apparatus (K, fig. 1) is dispensed
