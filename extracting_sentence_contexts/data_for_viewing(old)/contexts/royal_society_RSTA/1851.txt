There is no reason why one should even stop at a 32-column table, although the need for any
further expansion is hardly pressing. Nevertheless, if and when element 121 is synthesized,
this will signal the start of the g-block elements, at least in principle, and perhaps a need for a
50-column table (figure 6).° More specifically, it has been predicted that the first element that
actually possesses a g-electron will be element 125 or thereabouts [21].

Returning to Pyykk6’s work, this author does not choose to use a 50-column representation
even when discussing elements with atomic numbers up to 172. Nor does Pyykké favour a
32-column table but remains with the traditional 18-column representation (figure 7). Pyykk6’s
18-column periodic table [13], which has been featured in many articles, gives the appearance
of differing quite substantially from our current periodic table and indeed the author appears
to capitalize on this apparent difference. In fact, the only real novelty to emerge from Pyykké’s
relativistic calculations, and his proposed accompanying periodic table, occurs at elements 139
and 140, at which point the increasing atomic number sequence appears interrupted because the
j=1/2 component of the 8p shell (8p;/z) is occupied before the 6f levels. The small modification
that Pyykké proposes is the result of his prediction, and that of other authors [22].

typographically convenient.
