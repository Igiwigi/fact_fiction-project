In the case (i1), that is when the function G does not depend on x and the equation in (2.2)
is affine, theorem 2.2 can be particularly useful to solve BVPs associated to difference equations
with deviating arguments. Indeed, in this case, it can lead to a BVP associated with a second-order
difference equation without deviating argument. An application of this fact is in the following
section.

3. Proof of theorem 1.2

For proving theorem 1.2, the following auxiliary result is needed. Lemma 3.1.
