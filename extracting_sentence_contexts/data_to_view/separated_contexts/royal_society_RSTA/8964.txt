Dayron C. Mruter of the Case School of Applied Science, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A., notes
from the large and small diaphones were recorded in permanent form as sinuous lines on photographic films, making use of
the “phonodeik,” a description of which will be found in the inventor’s recent book ‘The Science of Musical Sounds,”
(Macmillan & Oo., New York, 1916). Records were obtained to distances of nearly three miles, and their analysis brought
out a number of interesting and important facts. It was found that the sound from the small diaphone, provided with a
detachable trumpet, was extremely complex. From records taken with and without the trumpet, it was inferred that the
effect of a resonator of correct design would be to concentrate a greater proportion of the total acoustic output into the
master tone.
