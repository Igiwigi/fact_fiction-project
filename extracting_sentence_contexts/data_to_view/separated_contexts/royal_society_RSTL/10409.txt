EZ Third 8eas0n of separation, 1872.â€”The characters of the seasons intermediate
etween the separation-year of 1867 and that of 1872 undoubtedly exercisged con-
Siderable influence on the struggle from year to year. The firs of the four inter-
Snediate years gave very heavy produce, characterized by great stemminess and
Snaturity ; the second, again, gave very heavy produce, but characterised by great
Yuxuriance and leafy growbh ; the third yielded the smallest crop of the whole series,
Srematurely ripened ; the fourth was one of variable characters, giving more than
Swerage amounts of produce, with great unevenness of development of the plants. It
As obvious that these various conditions were calculated to influence the character and
FHegults of the struggle in very various ways; and, in the facts adduced, we have
Yllustrated in a striking manner how greatly the question is complicated by the
Silement of 8eason. The season of 1872 itself was extremely changeable ; favourable for fair laxuriance,
Fput of very varying tendency to stem and seed formation, and to maturation, according
to the already established character of the herbage, and to the conditions of manuring
&upplied. There was generally less than average produce with deficient, and more
than average with high, manuring.
