which at late times leads to Richardson diffusion/dispersion or [? ~ & compared with P ~t
for ordinary diffusion. Both terms ‘diffusion’ and ‘dispersion’ can be used interchangeably, but
keeping in mind that the Richardson process results in superdiffusion (see [101] and references
therein) we feel that it is advantageous to use the term ‘dispersion’. Although the Richardson
dispersion process was introduced for hydrodynamic turbulence, a similar process is valid for
magnetized fluids. We will not distinguish the magnetized and not magnetized case by name and
instead of magnetic Richardson dispersion will use just Richardson dispersion. In magnetized
turbulence, Richardson dispersion is important in terms of spreading magnetic fields which
provides a way to re-derive the LV99 relations.

The fact that time dependence of the magnetic field diffusion induces magnetic reconnection
can be illustrated with the Sweet-Parker reconnection, where magnetic field lines are subject to
Ohmic diffusion. The latter induces the mean-squared distance across the reconnection layer that
a magnetic field line can diffuse by resistivity in a time t given by

(yb) ~ At, (3.9)

where 4. =c”/4sro is the magnetic diffusivity. The field lines are advected out of the sides of the
reconnection layer of length Ly at a velocity of order Va. Therefore, the time that the lines can


spend in the resistive layer is the Alfvén crossing time ta =Lx/Va. Thus, field lines that can
reconnect are separated by a distance
