carry per second past any cross section of their path, and this again is equal to Cm/e.
Hence, if 7 is the mean radius of the sheath (assumed thin) the angular momentum of
the electrons in it is

2Qar*Cm/e,

which for the maximum value of C just obtained is 2 10-‚Äù ; roughly 2000 times less than
that of the R effect, and of course still less when the sheath is absent.


ON THE RICHARDSON GYRO-MAGNETIC EFFECT. 287

The further fact which may be deduced from the last column of the table, that the
eddy currents have practically died down in a few thousandths of a second, is thus
superfluous to prove that their momentum is entirely too small to influence the measure-
ments of the R effect. There was, however, just the chance that some unsuspected
direct action of the field on the eddy currents might result in an incompletely
eliminated throw error, and for this reason we persevered in the experiments with the
copper sheath.

Table XT. contains the results of the five determinations made. The higher moment
of inertia in those for large damping is due to an added vane, and classes them with
the data for curve B; the three first Ratios corresponding with A.
