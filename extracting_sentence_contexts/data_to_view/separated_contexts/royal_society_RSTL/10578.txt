My own obser-
vations show tha it is only when the length of the rod (if of iron) is about 300 or 400
times its diameter that the effect of length becomes insensible. The principal draws
back to the use of very long rods is the difficulty of forming them (when the section
is ab all considerable) s0 as to be of sufficient length and at the same time homogeneous
and uniform in section. By using a ballistic galvanometer whose needle, although
sufficiently heavy to act ballistically, was comparatively light, I have been able to
obtain good results with rods of very mall section—wires in fact—which by the
operation of drawing are scarcely less uniform in section than turned rods, and are in
