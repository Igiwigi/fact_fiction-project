porphyritic. Moreover, the groundmass of the enclosing rock of the dome is holo-
crystalline and very slightly porous, while that of the nuée ardente agglomerate blocks
is semi-glassy to glassy and often markedly porous. Characteristics common to both
types of xenoliths are the similar characters of their glassy interstitial residuum, and
their vesicularity and porosity.

It is suggested that both types of xenolith represent partly crystallized bandaite
magma that once lined the walls of the magma conduit. During renewal of upward
movement of similar magma, pieces of semi-crystallized wall-rock were torn from the
conduit sides and incorporated as xenoliths in ascending magma, while still under
great pressure. The hornblende of the xenoliths is brown (in one agglomerate xenolith
very brownish green), and sometimes shows partial or complete resorption of the
‘‘pyroxenic”’ type (p. 54). From these facts we may make the further inference that
the wall-rock from which the xenoliths were derived came from a moderate depth in
the conduit, but from a higher level than the magma which, when the explosive
eruptions occurred, formed the pumice characterized by green hornblende (p. 54).

The large size of the crystals of the dome xenoliths is attributed to the retention of
mineralizers during a period of slow cooling under considerable pressure. This period
must have been prior to the tearing off of the xenoliths, for we cannot admit that large
feldspars grew in a highly viscous medium, or that the xenoliths, on incorporation,
contained a large proportion of fluid magma.

Let us assume that the semi-crystallized wall-rock that provided the coarse xenoliths
had crystallized more slowly than the wall-rock from which the agglomerate xenoliths
