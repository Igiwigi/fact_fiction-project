Some specimens of the figures of the orbits of chords are
exhibited in Plate VI. Fig. 44. At the middle of the chord, its
orbit has always two equal halves, but seldom at any other
point. The curves of Fig. 46, are described by combining
together various circular motions, supposed to be performed in
aliquot parts of the primitive orbit: and some of them approach
nearly to the figures actually observed, When the chord is of
unequal thickness, or when it is loosely tended and forcibly
inflected, the apsides and double points of the orbits have a very
evident rotatory motion. The compound rotations seem to
demonstrate to the eye the existence of secondary vibrations,
and to account for the acute harmonic sounds which generally
attend the fundamental sound. There is one fact respecting
these secondary notes, which seems intirely to have escaped
observation. If a chord be inflected at one-half, one-third, or
any other aliquot part of its length, and then suddenly left at
liberty, the harmonic note which would be produced by divid-

ing the chord at that point is intirely lost, and is not to be dis-
