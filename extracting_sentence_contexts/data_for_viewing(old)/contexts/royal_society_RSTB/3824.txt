to be insuperable.

Tt may, however, well be, as pointed out by Prof. Sums Woopneap (14) that, as in
the early stages of bone formation, the carbonates may be present in excess, In
speaking of bone, he says: “ Newly formed bones, or new bone-tissue of any kind,
where the cells are extremely active in building up the matrix, almost invariably have
a larger proportion of carbonate of lime than fully formed bones, because here the
active cells set free a larger proportion of carbonic acid, as a result of which more
phosphoric acid may be replaced by the carbonic acid lime salts.” The same conditions
probably apply to the other calcified organic tissues of the body, as enamel and
dentine. The conditions in young growing animals, where the metabolic changes are
very active, are eminently favourable to the production of carbonic acid, and it is quite
conceivable, and in fact probable, that in the early stages of enamel and dentine
formation, the carbonate may be greatly in excess of the phosphates, and thus the
deposit of lime salts as calcospherites be easily understood. The after alteration of
the chemical composition of the material in which calcification occurs, and the addition
of salts of phosphorus from the blood, would perhaps serve to account for the
