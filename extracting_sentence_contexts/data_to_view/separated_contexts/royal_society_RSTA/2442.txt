Liquid metal targets are among the new materials that are being investigated [18]. They
have the advantage that the divertor is in principle self-healing in case material is evaporated. Drawbacks are the possibility of droplets that may enter the plasma and the fact that the desired
flow pattern might be affected by the magnetohydrodynamic forces in the tokamak. It will also be
necessary to develop a scheme in which the loop of the liquid flow is closed so that the material
cannot accumulate in the plasma or the vessel. EUROfusion is exploiting a range of devices to test plasma-facing components.
