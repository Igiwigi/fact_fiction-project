This allows detection of specific interactions using functionalized tips and
probing of mechanical properties of single molecules, membranes and other living cells. The
miniaturization of the cantilever in HS-AFM results in a very low viscous damping, which
is a prerequisite for a ps-response time. In fact, the components and their miniaturization
necessary to perform HS-FS are equivalent to those of imaging. Another technical particularity
to improve the performance of HS-FS is to tilt the surface 45Â°, minimizing the effective viscous
drag of the cantilever. With this configuration, it is possible to reach pulling velocities up
to approximately 30mms~! [43,44].
