passing, although it, similarly increases the tension. But then we are met with the
difficulty that the intensity of the phosphorescent illumination in similar cases
increased by the introduction of an air-spark in spite of the diminution of the quantity
of the discharge. A possible explanation of this law is obtained by supposing s
the effect on the radiometer is proportional to the momentum with which the ps
leave the terminal while the phosphorescence depends on their energy. This won
mean that a diminution of quantity diminishes the number of particles leaving bn
terminal while the increase of tension increases the velocity ; such increase bein
insufficient, to prevent the total momentum of the particles from being decreased

It is a very significant fact that the intermittence of the phosphorescence Â©
