extent than are those of Heptanchus cinereus. But the method exposes one to the
risk of the fallacious process of arguing in a circle, for the taxonomic position of an
extinct shark is to some extent decided by the features of the calcified parts of its
vertebree. Paleospinax, for instance, now regarded as allied to the Cestracionts, was
when first discovered regarded as a Squalid because of the simplicity of its vertebre.
The identification of the fossil vertebrae, again, may possibly be at fault. It is
extremely probable that the vertebra figured by Hasse as that of a Crossorhinus
from the Gault of Cambridge (15, D, Plate 25, fig. 10) is not an Orectolobid at all; it
is much more likely to be a Lamnid (¢f. Plate 27, figs. 26 and 37).

The first method of inquiry mentioned above, that of the comparative study of the
vertebrae of adult fishes, was largely followed by Hasse, and the bulkiness of his mono-
graph is rather to be explained by this fact. In justice to him it may be pointed out
that until the vertebree of any particular fish are examined one cannot decide whether
they are of interest or not; when the examination has been made, the author is
performing a service to science by placing his observations on record, for even if the
structures prove to have no very direct bearing on the elucidation of the problem, he
spares his successors the labour of an independent examination of the vertebre.
Negative results, though disappointing from the author’s point of view, are not
without their value as an addition to knowledge.

The morphological method of inquiry, however, as it was pursued by Hasss, fails
to carry conviction owing to his neglect of the second or individual method; he
contrasted the trunk vertebra, for instance, of one species with the caudal vertebree
of another without, in some cases, at all events, first ascertaining the extent of the |
