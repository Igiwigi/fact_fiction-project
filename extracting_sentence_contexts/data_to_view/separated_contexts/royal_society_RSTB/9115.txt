1. Introduction

Light pollution has become a global concern, a fact substantiated by a recent reso-
lution of the American Medical Association (AMA) 2 years ago asserting that light
at night is a source of environmental pollution because it disrupts daily rhythms
and suppresses nocturnal melatonin production by the pineal gland [1]. Artificial
light at night (ALAN) exposures have been reported to be associated with serious
ecological consequences and health risks including cancer [2-4]. Recently, the
impact of light pollution as a new environmental risk factor and its relation to
human breast and prostate cancers was discussed [5].
