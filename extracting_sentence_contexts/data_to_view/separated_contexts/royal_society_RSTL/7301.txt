tory organ, as met with in the Nematoids, with that system of vessels in the Trematodl
and other animals, which, from its invariable communication with the exterior, has been
termed a © water-vascular ” apparatus. As I shall have again to allude to this subjech
when treating of the affinities of the N ematoids, I will now merely call attention to the
following facts:—that in both Nematoids and Trematodes the nature of the contents W
this system of canals is the same, whilst in Distomum tereticollef, as in A. lumbricoideh,
the fluid has been seen of an exceptionally reddish colour; that in some species of Tres
matodes, such as Monostomum faba, Distomum, cirrigerum, and Gasterostomum fimbriatuml
