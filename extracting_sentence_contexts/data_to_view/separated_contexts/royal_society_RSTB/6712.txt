The inoculum was obtained by means of the 1 mm. punch from either the
yellow or green areas of the systemic mottles or from the local lesion tissues as required. The X% strain was readily recovered from an apparently pure X°, and in some cases the
X® was unmixed with any other strain as shown by the fact that inoculum from the
green areas induced in some cases a completely negative result, in others, an X* infection
fully as severe as if the inoculum had been derived from a yellow necrotic area. The
former is taken as evidence of the absence of any less virulent strain, whilst the latter
is due to the fact that X° had begun to invade the green tissue, and there being no X° to
