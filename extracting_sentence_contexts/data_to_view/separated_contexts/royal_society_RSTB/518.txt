Microbes play an important
part; and his own experiments show that the action is developed in the absence of
clay. His results were not very favourable to the supposition that the plants them-
selves effected the fixation; but he considers that further comparative experiments,
with and without vegetation, are necessary to settle the point. For the present he
limits himself to the establishment of the great fact of the fixation of the free nitrogen
of the atmosphere, leaving to the future the exact explanation. In order to show the practical importance of the fixation of free nitrogen, M. Joutre
takes for illustration the results of the experiment No. 5, in the first series, in which
the largest amount of gain was indicated. In that experiment the complete mineral
manure, with caustic lime in addition, was used, without any artificial supply of nitrogen.
