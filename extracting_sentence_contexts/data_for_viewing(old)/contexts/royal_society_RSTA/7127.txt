Let P,(%,,4),2,) be any fixed point. Consider the region .7’ defined by the inequality
Sy, 2) Sf(*1, 91.21). The curve f(x, ¥,Z) =f(x,,4;,2,) either has the line x= 0 as an
asymptote or terminates on it. Therefore, the point at 00 on the line x = x, lies in 7’, so that,
by the convexity of 7’, any point on the line x = x, to the right of P lies in 7’. In other
words, if z,>z, then /(%,, Yo, Z2) >f(%1, 4, Z,). Therefore,

for fixed x, f(x,y, Z) is a non-decreasing function of z. (2:5)

Similarly, using the fact that the region either terminates on z = 0 or has it as an asymptote,
it can be shown that ; :
Sor fixed z, f(x, y,Z) is a non-decreasing function of x. (26)
Let P, be the point (1 —r, —2, 1 +7), where 0<r<1. As 0<1—r<1 +7, P, lies in the lower
half of the sector x>0,2>0. Consider the region 7’ defined by the relation

SF (*, 4,2) >f(l—r, —2,1-++1r).
Let its boundary be denoted by @’. Suppose the line A,:y =—2 is not a part of @’. As the
region 7’ is convex and symmetrical about the line A,:x =z and A, is perpendicular
to A,, the only points in which A, meets @’ are P, and P,, the image of P, in A,. Consequently
every point on A, lying outside the segment P, P, lies outside 7’. As P, is below A,, P, is above
it, so that every point on Ay, which lies between x = 0 and P,, lies outside 7’. This means
that if 0<r,<1 and r,>r, then f(1—r, —2,1-+7,)<f(1—r, —2,1+47r). In case A, forms
