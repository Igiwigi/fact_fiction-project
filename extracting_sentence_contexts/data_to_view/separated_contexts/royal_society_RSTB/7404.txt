Internal waves in a three-layered basin

The above rough estimates of velocity may not be far removed from reality as far as the
epilimnion is concerned (see later discussion), but even a casual inspection of figure 10 will
show that the hypolimnion estimates are quite misleading. The hypolimnion is clearly not,
as assumed, a homogeneous layer. In fact this description can only reasonably be applied to
the portion below the 20m isobath. Between this and the thermocline—defined as the region
of maximum density gradient—there lies a band of intermediate water, which we may call
the metalimnion. The lower isotherms in this layer undergo large deflexions of complex
wave-form, which can only be the result of considerable water movement.
