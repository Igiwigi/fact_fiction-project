There are a large number of other lines clearly related to the F type. Their
complete discussion would require a more searching investigation than can be given
now. Several sets are related in a manner which is quite common in spark and rich
are spectra, indicated by the fact that a number of lines may differ in succession by
nearly the same separationâ€”a kind of relation which cannot be due to collateral
displacement by equal denommator differences. There are a few also which seem to
be attached parasitically to S and D lines. There may be uncertainty also as to
