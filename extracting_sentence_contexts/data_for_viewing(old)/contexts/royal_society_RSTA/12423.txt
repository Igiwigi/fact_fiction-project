its consequences, to lead to great complication and unnaturalness. This will he
illustrated in the following example, a simple case in which we can readily and fully
calculate all details by different methods, so as to be quite sure of the results we
ought to obtain.

A worked-out Example to Exhibit the Forcives contained in Different Stresses.

§ 36. Given a fluid medium of inductivity »,, in which is an intrinsic magnet of
the same inductivity. Calculate the attraction between the magnet and a large solid
mass of different inductivity p, Here it is only needful to calculate the force on a
single pole, so let the magnet be infinitely thin and long, with one pole of strength m
at distance a from the medium pz, which may have an infinitely extended plane
boundary. By placing a fictitious pole of suitable strength at the optical image in
the second medium of the real pole in the first, we may readily obtain the solution,

Let PQ be the interface and the real pole be at A and its image at B. We have
first to calculate the distribution of R, magnetic force, in both media due to the
pole m, as disturbed by the change of inductivity. We have div y,R, =m in the
first medium, and div ~,R, = 0 in the second, therefore R has divergence only on
the interface. Let o be the surface density of the fictitious interfacial matter to
correspond ; its force goes symmetrically both ways; the continuity of the normal
induction therefore gives, at distance 7 from A, the condition
