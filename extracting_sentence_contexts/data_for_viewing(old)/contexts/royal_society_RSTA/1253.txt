Figure 6. (a) Photochemical model predictions for the time evolution of CO introduced from a large cometary impact on
Neptune, along with a smaller steady source from the ablation of icy interplanetary dust grains (Figure modified from
Moses & Poppe [148]). (b) Mixing ratio profiles derived for CS, HCN and CO from analyses of the millimetre and sub-millimetre
observations of Moreno et al. [42] and Luszcz-Cook & de Pater [53]. Note that although the column abundance of CS is well
constrained from the observations, the mixing-ratio profile is not, so multiple models are shown that all provide a good fit to
the data [42] (figure modified from Moreno et al. [42]). (Online version in colour.)

above the atmosphere before falling back upon the stratosphere [178,179]. During this plume
splashback phase, the material that re-enters the atmosphere is reshocked (resetting the molecular
composition) and deposited within the middle stratosphere [175,176,179,180]. The plume re-entry
shock from the Shoemakerâ€”Levy 9 impacts was characterized by relatively low shock pressures
and high temperatures, with the maximum shock temperatures depending on the plume re-
entry vertical velocity (and thus distance from the impact site) [175]. The fact that CO was
favoured over H2O at the impact sites suggested that typical peak re-entry shock temperatures
were approximately above 1400 K during the Shoemaker-Levy 9 impacts [175,176]. In general,
CO was found to be a factor of approximately 10-100 more abundant that H2O in the Jovian
stratosphere after the impacts [176,180,181], and the CO, HCN and CS that were formed during
the plume splashback phase have persisted for years in the Jovian stratosphere [182-186], as
was predicted from photochemical models [177,187,188]. Observations suggest that these species
were introduced at pressures less than approximately 0.1 mbar after the impacts, and have
been diffusing slowly downward since that time [180,182,189]. External species delivered to
atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune from large cometary impacts are expected to have similar
behaviour, although the amount of material introduced and its initial vertical distribution will
depend on the size of comet, as well as its entry velocity.
