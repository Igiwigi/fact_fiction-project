yet if the integrals were left indefinite, we might obtain an integral of an expression which should differ from
the integral of the same expression obtained by a slightly different process, by a constant. By another inte-
gration this would cease to be a constant, and we should obtain thus different values for Pz. The fact 1s, that
constants must be added at each integration, and recourse had to the original equation, to determine them in
terms of m, k, and þ.
