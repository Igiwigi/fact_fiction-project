My dissections, some
8ixty in number, have in all instances supplied me with my description, and
have for the most part been carefully photographed in illustration. They are pre-
seryed and catalogued in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of Eng-
land; and I take this opportunity of acknowledging my obligations to the Council
of the College for the facilities afforded me in their preparation. By adopting the
methods explained, I have obtained remarkably uniform results, and am fully persnaded
that the fibres of the bladder and prostate, contrary to the received opinion, are
curvilinear, and in fact spiral, or, more properly, lemniscate. The fibres, with few
exceptions, form figure-of-eight loops, and the loops are variously shaped, according as
they are superficial or deep. The most external and the most internal loops are attenu-
ated or drawn out, and in this respect resemble longitudinal or vertical fibres, the
deeper or more central ones being flattened from above downwards, and resembling
circular fibres.
