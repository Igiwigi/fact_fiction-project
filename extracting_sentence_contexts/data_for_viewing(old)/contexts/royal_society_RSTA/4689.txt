We then define the comparison function F :[0,7) x 2 — R via

Note that the first and the second terms in the square brackets on the right-hand side of (4.11) are
negative, while the fourth and the fifth terms are small, being of order e. If x is close to I”, then the
second term dominates the third term and if x is away from the boundary /”, then one can choose
«2 > 0 so that the first term dominates the third term. Thereby we use the fact that both g; and y
vanish at I”, they are both non-negative (by the maximum principle), and both satisfy the Hopf
lemma (since they are both supersolutions). It follows, then, that there exists a «2 > 0 and some
constant C; such that

(1 = aijdjj — b;9;)F < —Cyx e 8, (4.12)
It then follows from (4.12) and (3.2) that

Note, however, that the term in parentheses on the right-hand side above is a quadratic
nonlinearity and as such decays at least as fast as e~*!:
