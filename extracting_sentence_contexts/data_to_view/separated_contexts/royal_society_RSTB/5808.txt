This does not agree with the findings of BucHanan (1928) ;
it is accounted for by the sterilization of the outer surface of the stones. The lack of
penetration of the stone by fungi has been taken to indicate their inability to cause
decay of the stone, and consequently surface growths have been neglected throughout
the subsequent investigations. Another fact worthy of note was a strong preponderance
of non-sporing organisms. Considering the nature of the habitat, its varying conditions
of moisture, and the probable periods of food shortage which almost certainly occur. the bacterial population might have been expected to consist mainly of sporing
types.
