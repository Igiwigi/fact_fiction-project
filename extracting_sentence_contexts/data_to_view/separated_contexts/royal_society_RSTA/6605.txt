Lemma 6. There exists an absolute constant A>1 with the following property. For any positive
numbers i and p there exists a unt w in the field k(0) such that

Bie +o < Aa, (72)

f < +0’ < Ag, (73)
1 ae.

aie <-+0"< Ww (74)

where the three signs may be prescribed arbitrarily.

} The result is due to Davenport (see Davenport 1943).
} For these facts, see Davenport (1943). INEQUALITIES WITH AN INFINITY OF SOLUTIONS 329

Proof. It suffices to prove that there exists a constant B such that, for any positive A, 4,
there is a unit w satisfying

p< +o-< BA, (75)
ul ’

p< +0' < Bu, 76
B

where the signs may be arbitrarily prescribed, and where also the sign of w” may be

arbitrarily prescribed.
