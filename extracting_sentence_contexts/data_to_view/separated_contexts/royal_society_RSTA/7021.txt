It has been
found, however, that the bromine treatment for SO, removes olefins at the same time,
and, if the treatment is carried out rapidly, no loss of peroxide is observed. These above are the only serious interferences with possible analytical methods from
minor constituents of the cylinder gases. Bearing in mind the above facts two satisfactory
procedures were developed for peroxide analysis.

(1) The potassium iodide method

The gas passing from the sampling valve was taken to the scrubbing trap by as short
a length of synthetic rubber tubing as possible. In the trap it was scrubbed by passage up
a glass bead-packed column 20 in. high containing 40 ml. of 3Â°% sulphamic acid solution. At the end of the sampling run the solution was transferred to a glass-stoppered bottle and
immediately scrubbed with CO, for 2 min. to remove air.
