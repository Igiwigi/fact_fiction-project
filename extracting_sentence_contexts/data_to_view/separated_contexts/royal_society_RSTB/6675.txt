Like Kéhler (1934) Béhme is of opinion that X variations undergo
change within the potato plant of the nature of Dauermodifikationem, but as he has not
evaluated the clinical effects of quantitative mixtures of really pure types and their
mutual neutralizing interaction, such conclusions do not seem to be warranted by the
evidence adduced. In Cambridge evidence suggesting such a change in two potato
varieties is described on p. 160 and p. 163. Hamilton (1932) described a virus she called Hy IV, which she found in a field plant
of Hyoscyamus niger grown for commercial purposes and which she distinguished from
the X virus by the fact that it would not infect the potato varieties Arran Victory,
Arran Chief, President or Epicure. Miss Hamilton kindly gave the author material,
and in 1933 it was successfully transferred to President and Epicure, killing the latter
with top necrosis and calling forth a mottle in the former. It was found that prior
inoculation of tobaccos with X° completely protected against Hy IV.
