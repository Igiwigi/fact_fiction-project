deep blue colour. The last-mentioned colour reaction is one which is commonly shown
by phenylhydrazides.

Nitrogen analyses by Dumasâ€™ method gave 8-44 per cent. and 8-33 per cent. Ny.

A phenylhydrazide or a phenylhydrazone of citrinin would require a nitrogen
content of 8-24 per cent. corresponding to CyyH,o0,N, while a phenylhydrazine salt
of citrinin would require a nitrogen content of 7-82 per cent. corresponding to
CyoHs205Np.

Taking the above figures for the nitrogen content of this compound, and also con-
sidering the fact that it is insoluble in potassium acetate solution and that citrinin
cannot be shown to exhibit ketonic properties with other ketonic reagents, it appears
probable that the derivative obtained is a phenylhydrazide of citrinin.

As little success had been obtained in attempts to make derivatives of citrinin the
breakdown products of citrinin were now investigated.

Decomposition Propucts or Crrrinin.

It was observed on a small scale that when citrinin is boiled with dilute sulphuric
acid it loses its colour and obvious decomposition takes place.
