The cross-section in the bomb had been previously
measured with the original tubing and it was found to agree with the value deter-
mined from this calibration. Results of average density determinations at 50-10
and 50-87 atmospheres are given in Table III and represented in fig. 3. Evidence
that the density of the system was uniform is given by the fact that the results of the
average density calculations agree with the values obtained by float observations.
