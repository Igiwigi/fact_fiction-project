ordinary work with the spectroscope.

To these I have added one who is interesting as being the brother of the two
cases of red-blindness specially described in my previous paper. His colour sensations
were quite normal, and he could see K, but not the iron lines beyond K in the are
spectrum which were visible to all the others.

Evidence of a Separate Sensation for Blue,

Tt will be observed that I have definitely included Blue among the normal colour
sensations. Since 1899 I have examined several hundred persons whose colour
sensations were normal, and I find that what I then said about the existence of
a blue colour sensation, as distinct from violet, is confirmed. In view of the fact
that this statement brings me in conflict with the accepted forms of Youna’s
theory and also with that of Hrrtya, some discussion of the evidence may be

The conclusion drawn from my experiments, that no one colour sensation is related
to any other in the sense indicated by Herre, receives collateral confirmation from
the observations of Water on the retinal currents of the frog’s eye excited by
