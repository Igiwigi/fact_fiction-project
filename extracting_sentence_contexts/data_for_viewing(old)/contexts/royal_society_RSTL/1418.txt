It is in the highest degree curious to vbserve, that four of

formerly did in Britain ; whilst the hippopotamus is now con-
fined exclusively to Africa, and the elephant, rhinoceros and
hyzna are also diffused widely over the continent of Asia,

Such are the principal facts I observed in the interior of
the cave at Kirkdale, and such the leading conclusions that
seem to arise from them ; and I cannot sufficiently lament
that I was not present at its first opening, to witness the exact
state in which it appeared, before any part of the surface of
the mud had been disturbed.

From the description given of the state of the bones, and
of the mud and stalactite that accompany them, we may ex-
