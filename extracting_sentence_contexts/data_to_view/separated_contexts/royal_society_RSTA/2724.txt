Copper-tin-antimony.—Liquidus points for this ternary system have been determined
by Tasaxr*, who used an electrical resistance method in which the temperature varia-
tions of resistance of rods of the alloys were measured. The compositions of the alloys
given in the tables are from the weights of metals used, but analyses showed that the
desired composition was obtained, although it is not clear whether the analyses referred
to the specimens after the actual resistance measurements had been made. The
accuracy of the method may be estimated from the fact that figures given for binary
copper-antimony alloys agree well with those of CARPENTER,{ whilst for binary copper-
tin alloys, some of Tasaxr’s figures differ by 5°-10° from those of Heycock and
NeEvILLE, others being in good agreement. Taste XVI. Composition of alloy.
