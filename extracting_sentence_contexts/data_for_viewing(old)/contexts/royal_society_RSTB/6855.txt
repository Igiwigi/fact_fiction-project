of debris brought down in times of flood. At the seaward ends of the steep ghauts on
the southern slopes of South Soufriére Hill, huge boulders form part of the cone of
deposition.

The only alluvial delta of importance is at the mouth of the Balham River (Old
Road Bay). Davis regarded the slightly embayed valleys of Silver Hill (presumably
Cars Bay and Rendezvous Bay) as an indication of submergence. Old Road Bay seems
to the writer to be even more suggestive. Most of the ghauts, on submergence, would

not give rise to embayed valleys, because of the facts mentioned in the last paragraph,
and because they are excavated in loose deposits readily cut back by wave action.

In contrast to some of the other islands of the Lesser Antilles, there are no raised
beaches in Montserrat. Low narrow platforms that border the sea in several places
between Plymouth and O’Garra’s appear to be due to the coalescence of detrital
deposits from neighbouring ghauts, banked up by the agency of waves and currents.

Sandy beaches are found only at certain places on the west (leeward) coast, as at
Cars Bay, Woodlands Bay, and Fox Bay, and on both sides of Plymouth. A striking
feature of the sands is their dark colour. Concentration, by wave action, of the heavier
constituents, leads to the production of very black layers. A sample of the ‘‘black
sand” from Fox Bay proved, on microscopic examination, to be composed largely of
