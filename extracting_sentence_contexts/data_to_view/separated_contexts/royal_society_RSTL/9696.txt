These results plotted as a diagram give the curve shown in diagram A, marked
« Moist Air.”

Up to a pressure of about 350 millims. the presencg of aqueous vapour has little or
no influence on the viscosity of air. The two curves are in fact snperimposed. At
this point, however, divergence commences, and the curve rapidly bends over, the
log. dec. falling from 00903 to 00500 between 50 and 7 millims.
