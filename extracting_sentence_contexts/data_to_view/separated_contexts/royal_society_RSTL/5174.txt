In the parenchyma of the liver, just at the beginning of the fifth day, the formation
of vessels and blood was very well seen; several groups of blood-globules lay in short
channels provided with a fine homogeneous lining; these were oval or more elongated;
they did not appear to coalesce, but were manifestly tending to snch an arrangement,
which a few hours later had actually occurred. I saw no cells throwing out filamentary processes, snch as KGLuKER has described ;
the channels containing the blood- globules were spaces excavated in the blastematous
mass; their homogeneous walls I believe to be produced secondarily, and their
coalescence to be effected by a simple extension of their cavity. About the eleventh day I found the parenchyma of the liver consisting of nuclei, cells,
amorphous and abundant oily matter ; here and there in the midst of the substance
there were seen mall bright yellow particles, which were doubtless biliary matter ;
the gall-bladder also was full of green bile, the presence of which, as there was no
trace of cysto-hepatic ducts to be seen, I cannot satisfactorily explain ; it does not
appear to me, however, an idea to be altogether rejected, that before the hepatic
ducts are fully developed, and have begun to eliminate bile in the parenchyma, their
fanction should for a time be performed by the epithelium of the gall-bladder, which
lies in close contact almost imbedded in the mass of the liver: the fact, at any rate,
is, that the gall-bladder contains bile, when there is not a trace of it in the ducts, and
when their development is yet incomplete. The development of the pancreas seems to be very similar in its mode to that of
the liver, and the same plan will, I believe, be found to be followed in the formation
of all glands. The organ consists at, first of blastematous matter, imbedding nuclei
and myriads of granular globules, which are clustered over with oily molecules.
