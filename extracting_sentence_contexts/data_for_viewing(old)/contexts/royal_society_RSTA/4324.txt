The two-term case is somewhat ambiguous and not easy to see. This additive-multiplicative
ambiguity is hard to resolve until we consider a case with three or more wave multiplications, for
example:

x(f) = cos A cos B cos C

(2.4)

~ 4} +cos(A —B+C) +cos(A — B—C)

_l cos(A + B+ C) + cos(A + B— C)
In fact, it can be shown that n product terms will end with the sum of 2) waves. All the additive
terms will congregate near the highest frequency component. This shifting of energy density to
high frequency not only is uninformative, but also makes the spectral energy density inextricably
mixed with noise and harmonics. To carry this argument a step further mathematically, let us
consider the case of the sum and product of a sinusoidal modulating the white noise given

above as
n

x1 (f) = (a+ bcos A) + > cos 6;
j=l
