Finisterre, yet, in the night, he had a very narrow escape from
shipwreck. Very many others have been brought into the
same kind of danger: s0 that the land of Finisterre, were it
not discernible at a considerable distance ; and its offing clear
of rocks and shallows; and moreover, situated in a finer cli-
mate, would prove a kind of Scilly, to mariners.

I have not been able to obtain any proofs, on record, con-
cerning the course of the current, round the Bay of Biscay. I
formerly collected some information from a French com-
mander respecting it. He said, that the setting of the current
along the coast of France, to the north and north-west, was
a fact well understood ; and even acted on by many, in the
choice of the zach, on which the current gave the greatest
advantage, with dead winds.

One circumstance, and that a very striking one, in respect

* Nor, admitting an equal rate, in both places, could it well be. For the current
enters the Bay of Biscay, in an east direction, but goes off from it, north-west. So
that, if a ship was carried fifty miles to the NW, from Ushant, she would only have
made about thirty-five westing : but in the other case, she would be carried the whole
fifty, eastward towards the Bay, and Cape Finisterre.
