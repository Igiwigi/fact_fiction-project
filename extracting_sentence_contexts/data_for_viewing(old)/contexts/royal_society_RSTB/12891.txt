children [19,20,27], to our knowledge, there is no comparable
evidence with non-human primates. Such evidence is necessary
to address the question of cognitive specialization.

Here, we investigate these questions using well-established
touchscreen-based sequence learning tasks. Touchscreen tasks
use familiar responses in novel ways and allow for within-
subject comparisons, something that is impossible to do with
object-based tasks involving serial actions or events (e.g.
[10,14,28]). Given that most complex responses confound ser-
iating item-specific information (i.e. which objects are relevant
when in an event) with spatial-specific information (i.e. when
and where in space objects are placed), coupled with the fact
that the brain independently processes what and where infor-
mation [29], we employed two sequencing tasks that isolate


these components. In the item-specific task (hereafter called the items are identical within a trial, but change across trials; El
