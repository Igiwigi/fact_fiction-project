Robert Hooke (1635-1703) made a crucial observation for the design of masonry arches. In 1676 he
pointed out that ‘as hangs the flexible line, so but inverted will stand the rigid arch’ [23]. Thus, if
such a curve could be drawn within the voussoirs of a masonry arch, that arch would stand. This
brilliant piece of intuitive thinking is the basis of rational design of all masonry arches, vaults and
domes [26-28]. (Hooke put forward his theorem in the form of an anagram; that was an extreme
ploy in the seventeenth century for claiming priority for a result without revealing the working
behind it.)

Hooke used this method for the design, with Wren (1632-1676), of the great dome of St Paul’s
Cathedral in London: the weights of a radial ‘slice’ of masonry blocks were hung from an
imaginary light chain for this purpose. St Paul’s is the only large masonry dome which has not
shown signs of distress by cracking. (The apparently cylindrical drum above the ‘whispering
gallery’ is in fact slightly conical, in accordance with the shape of the inverted catenary.)

In 1673 L.-G. Pardies (1636-1673) published La Statique in Paris. He claimed that the catenary
curve would be unchanged if any parts of it were solidified. He also stated that if portions of
a chain were removed, conceptually, they could be replaced by suitable forces, tangential to the
curve, acting on the remaining portions. In other words, he proposed the idea of considering
the statical equilibrium of forces acting on a ‘free body’.

In May 1690 Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705) proposed, in Acta Eruditorum, Leipzig—in Latin—
a contest to find the catenary curve. In June 1691 the same journal published three solutions,
by Johann Bernoulli (1667-1748), Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716) and Christiaan Huygens (1629-
1693). Of these, only Leibniz gave an equation, equivalent to (4.8), but without proof and with no
mention of the underlying differential equation; but he does state that his differential calculus was
