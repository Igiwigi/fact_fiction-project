The second question is related to the ‘interface’. It sounds clear that there is a direct contact
between ice and the outer shell of the structure. The fact that ice often fails by crushing, i.e. being
broken into a granular material containing also very small ice particles, obscures the idea of a
direct contact that is defined to occur between intact ice and the structure. There may be a direct
contact in the interface and also contact through the crushed ice. Local ice edge cracking can also create a contact that is smaller than what is usually described
as the nominal contact area.
