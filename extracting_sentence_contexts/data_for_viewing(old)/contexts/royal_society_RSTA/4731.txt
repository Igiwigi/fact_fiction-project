be embedded in lower-dimensional smooth manifolds. In this note, we shall also prove partially

new results for the free boundary close to singular points.

(b) Reformulation of the problem

The departing point of the theory was to look at free boundary points where there is a non-
degeneracy. More exactly, one considers only points z, where Ag(z) <0, and that g is smooth
enough around the point z. The smoothness required is a Dini continuity for Ag. This is actually
a slightly larger class than assuming Dini continuity of the second derivatives. In this regard, one
can mention the paper of Blank [9] where he proves existence of solutions to the obstacle problem
with a free boundary that spirals around a point. The construction of I. Blank depends heavily on
the fact that the Ag is non-Dini.

As mentioned earlier, having settled the optimal C!!-regularity of the solution, one can
consider the equation

Au=(A@)x{u=y) in By,

which can be written as
Av=(—Ag)xv>0) in Bi,
with v=u— 9g.

(c) Non-degeneracy
