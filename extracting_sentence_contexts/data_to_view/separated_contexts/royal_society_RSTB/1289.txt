The necessary provision
"2 of surface forces adequate to resist this tension and preserve the wall from being
Bsined of water will set a limit to the dimensions of distinct perforations in the
3 torus, if indeed such exist. 4 Tt would appear from the unsymmetrical dévelopitocnt of the pits, by means of
& which the cells of the medullary rays and wood-parenchyma communicate with the
“Z conduits, that the tension established by transpiration is not transmitted in full
= through them. That their contents are often influenced by this tension is, perhaps,
gE indicated by the fact that the closing membrane of the unilateral pits is very usually
a bulged into the lumen of the adjoining conduit. 3 There is one other argument i in favour of the existence of that state of tension of
8 the sap which we assume in the foregoing, and that is the difficulty of explaining the
evasion of such a state. For the conditions inevitably lead to it.
