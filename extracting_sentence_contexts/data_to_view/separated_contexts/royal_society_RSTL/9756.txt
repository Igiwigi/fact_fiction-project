THE FROG, AND ON THE ACTION OF THE VAGUS NERVE. 999

 impulse, because each impulse, though unable to canse & contraction of the muscle, may
© inerease its excitability to the height necessary for the production of a beat by the time
the next impulse reaches the tissue. The proof of these assertions depends upon the fact that, by the method of clamping,
it is possible to alter the relation between the strength of the impulses and the
excitability of the ventricular muscle without affecting the relation between the motor
ganglia and the auricular muscle. The rate, therefore, at which the impulses are senb
out from the motor ganglia is indicated by the rate of the auricular beats, and the
extent of synchronism between them and the beats of the ventricle determines the

Q number of impulses that have been made inefficient, as far as the causation of a
8 ventricular beat is concerned, by the action of each special operation.
5 This want of sequence between the auricular and ventricular contractions can be
S obtained by three different methods.
= 1. By tightening the clamp in the auriculo-ventricular groove.
3 2, By heating the auricles and sinus without heating the ventricle.
