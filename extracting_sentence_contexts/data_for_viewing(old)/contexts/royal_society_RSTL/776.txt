first to doubt my former experiments. But it is necessary to
be observed by whoever $hall think them worth the trouble of
verifying, that even these experiments are liable to fail unless
proper precautions are used: that I have never operated upon
less than one hundred grains; and that the results, which 1
have stated, however simple they may appear, have been the
constant labour of s0me weeks.

POSTSCRIPT.

Since this Paper was written Dr. WoLLasTox has published
8ome experiments upon platina. He has found that palladium
is contained in very small quantities in crude platina. This fact
was mentioned to me more than a year ago by Dr. WoLLasToN,
I have not yet seen a copy of his Paper; but I shall merely
observe here that, whatever be the quantity of palladium found
in a natural state, no conclusion can be drawn as to its being
simple or compound. Nothing is more probable than that
nature may have formed this alloy, and formed it much better
than we can do. At all events the amalgamation to which
platina is submitted before it reaches Europe is sufficient to
account for a small portion of palladium, -
