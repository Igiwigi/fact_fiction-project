a curve of the type [1, 3], 7.c., a rational quartic. Thus the reverse system of primals ¥
consists of quartic primals having a double quadric surface Q and a projected Veronese
surface $',4 in common, where $',* meets Q in a rational quartic curve.

Each ¥-primal V,‘ contains a [4, 4] of planes, the two fours meeting Q in lines of
opposite systems||; and the first four describe a V,° of planes which has ¢4’,* as double
surface.

Generators of Q of one system correspond to trisecant planes of ¢, which pass through P.
Such generators are projections of @-planes of 2 which pass through P’. Each of the
corresponding trisecant planes contains four base points of ®, and conics through these

* A general @’-surface can, in fact, be represented on the plane @ by cubic curves through A,, ..., As
and we can take c, to be represented by a quartic curve with double points at A,, Ao, A, and passing through
A,and A,. The points A,, Ay and A, and the line A,A, will then represent lines of the ’-surface which
are chords of ¢,.

t See ‘ Principles of Geometry,’ p. 52.

} A double four of planes (sometimes written [4, 4]) in [5| consists of two sets of four planes, such that
each plane of one set meets the others of its set in points and all but one of the other set in lines.
