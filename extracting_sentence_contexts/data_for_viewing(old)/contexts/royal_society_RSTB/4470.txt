In addition to this staining effect the fractures in longitudinal shearing show
features which can be further correlated with the characteristic method by which
failure is initiated in compression. The longitudinal shearing stresses, operating on
the wall of a tracheide (if this were isotropic), would tend to produce separation along
two systems of planes inclined approximately at 45° to the direction of stress. The
actual result on the thin-walled tracheides is consistent with this expectation except
for the inclination of the planes. The oblique splits represent the direction of one
of the series of planes of separation, while the fine striz on the shreds are slip-
lines due to the stretching. In some few instances splits occur simultaneously in both
series of planes of separation giving an irregular fracture such as is seen in Plate 4,
fig. 23. Much more often the splits are confined to one of the series of planes of
separation and shreds are produced which show striz or slip-lines. The anisotropy
of the cell-wall probably explains the fact that the inclination of the planes of
separation, as manifested by the splits and the striae on the shreds, is not 45° to the
direction of the stress.

The inclination of the planes of separation as seen on the surfaces of the walls,
unlike that of the gliding planes, which have been decribed above, for compression
failures, is similar to, or identical with, that of the slits of the pits. This corre-
spondence between the inclination of the splits and that of the pit-slits, as well as the
possible nature and effect of the natural anisotropy of the cell-wall will, be discussed
below, in connection with the general questions bearing on the internal structure of
the woody cell-walls.
