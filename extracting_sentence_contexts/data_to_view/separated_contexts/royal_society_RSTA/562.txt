The simple method proposed here to estimate SW forcings and feedbacks is shown to be very
efficient to highlight differences between periods and models. More complete analyses of the
feedback estimates at model grid points offer additional information on the differences between
models. As an example, the fact that the IPSL model produces different SW cloud feedback at the
global or the hemispheric scales is mainly because of the mid-latitude ocean cloud cover. In other
regions, the IPSL model results are more similar to those of the other models. Also, the results
highlight the higher sensitivity of the MIROC-ESM and CCSM4 over snow and ice-covered area.
