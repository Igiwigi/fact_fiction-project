MR. R, C. ROWE ON ABEI'S THEOREM, 731

Secrion IT.

12, The expression (in a form algebraic or logarithmic) of the xum SÅ¿Xda having
been shown to exist, and having in fact been found, ABEL proceeds, in his art. 5, to
investigate the condition that this expression should become a constant. Of the pos-
sibility of this we have been assured by the result of the firs} example and of the first
case of the second example of art. 11. This investigation, as subordinate to the main
purpose, may be conyeniently postponed to the second principal inquiry with which
the memoir is concerned.
