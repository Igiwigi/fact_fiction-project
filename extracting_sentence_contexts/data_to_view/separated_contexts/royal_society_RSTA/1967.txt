The Hermite polynomials are defined as [47-49]

Hn (&*) =(-1)" -w (é*), (2.3)
where the weight function , w(é*), is defined as

The coefficients appearing in equation (2.2) are computed as

Being interested in the low-order dynamics of the distribution function (the Euler and NS : S
levels) in the context of the LB method and limited by the order of the quadrature, a truncated : =

Ana priori argument for the order of truncation N can be provided via a simple Chapman-Enskog : <
(CE) analysis of the continuous Boltzmann equation (to find highest order moments of the EDF Do

involved at the NS scale). For example, to correctly recover the mass and momentum balance [a
equations at the NS level, one must set N to three. This rational is further backed by the fact that : S
Hermite polynomials are mutually orthonormal. In the remainder of this article it will be shown : 3

that a posteriori considerations such as stability enhancement through error control of higher order [$

moments can affect the choice of this truncation [50]. The truncated Hermite polynomial expansion of the distribution function can then be used in
a Gauss—Hermite quadrature to discretize phase space (&*):
