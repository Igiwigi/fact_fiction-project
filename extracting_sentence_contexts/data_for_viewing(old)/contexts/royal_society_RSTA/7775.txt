Watson’s original paper should be consulted for the full explanation of these terms.
The difficulty of the analysis lies in the fact that this determination of the zeroes requires
an intimate knowledge of the intricate Bessel and Hankel functions involved.

In a paper by one of the writers (Eckersley 1931-2) it was shown that Watson’s
solution was essentially equivalent to an eigenfunction solution, appropriate to wave
problems of this type. Thus the eigenfunctions are the residues of the integrals discussed
above, and the proper values are the discrete values of s which make the expression for
(s) zero. This general relation was made clear by assuming a solution for the potential
function y of the form exp(270) /7, substituting this in the general differential equation
and determining the approximate condition for S' in the form

where J is the wave-length, and » the prope rvalues, corresponding to Watson’s s values,
which are to be determined. On integrating round the branch points of the integrand
