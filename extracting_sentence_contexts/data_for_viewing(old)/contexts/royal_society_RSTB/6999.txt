their formation in Anthophysa.

All the strains of Anthophysa I have seen and cultivated belonged definitely to A. vegetans,-
although there are slight physiological or morphological differences between them. Thus,
one showed only a scanty formation of cysts, while others were always rich in them. Once
a form was observed with cells which were shorter and broader than usual, but in thriving
cultures this difference disappeared. This deviation from the type was therefore only due
to poor nutrition, but the others were hereditary and therefore true varieties.

II. Cultural technique and material

According to Lemmermann (1910, p. 376) Anthophysa is an indicator of waters rich in
iron. Itis, in fact, generally associated with Leptothrix, the sheaths of which are impregnated
with iron. If there is sufficient organic matter, Cladothrix dichotoma, Zoogloea ramigera and
many other bacteria may be present. There is, however, often no evident precipitate of
iron compounds in the waters frequented by Anthophysa. The latter was found in the muni-
cipal water supply of Prague by Molisch (1892), Adler (1904) and Ruttner (1906) at a time
when insufficiently filtered water from the river Vltava (Moldau) was used for household
purposes, but since the water is more carefully purified it has disappeared.

Adler (1904) first established that good development took place when ferrous ammonium
citrate or manganous iron citrate were added to the Prague tap water. The form developed
in cultures with the manganese salt had thicker, blackish brdwn stalks in place of the reddish
brown ones in cultures without manganese. From other experiments Adler concluded that
Anthophysa only needs the small traces of iron required for the growth of every organism.
