In this instance, however, the correspondence is
not entirely clear, for the anatomical and embryological significance of the cysts
observed by Burrows is unknown; there is only presumptive evidence that they too
are derivatives of the primordial female reproductive tract. The fact that none of the Miillerian vestiges found in the male reacts to progesterone
alone is of interest in view of previous observations which show that this hormone has
