particularly prevalent. This was found to be the case also in Ag and Au, the only
elements in which the linkages have been examined with any thoroughness. In
particular the series of successive + and — links from 27497 recalls a similar

the improbability of its belonging to the D system.

arrangement in the AgD(4) linkage shown in the e¢, d, e columns of the map for
AgPiii[IV.]. The series is in fact continued further than is shown in the present map.
Starting from 26727 we find a—c+b—d+a—c+a—ce (and +d) = 8a+b—(3c+d), the
actual separations being 770°92—803'607 +787°51—821°81+771'07 —803°66 +770°68
—803'16 (and +825'35). Further, it should be noted that each successive pair is a
parallel inequality, one in excess and the other in deficit of normal value. It means
an increased displacement 26, in each alternate line. But if the observation errors are
small, there appear to be indications of simultaneous displacements in the f sequences
as well as on the limit. In fact a similar phenomenon is indicated in the two next
orders though naturally some elements are wanting. A precisely similar connection
is shown by AgS (3), [IV., p. 382], in a still more striking and regular series of
changes. The elucidation of the laws governing displacements is of the first
importance and should be one of the immediate objects of investigation. For this
purpose examples of continuous series of simultaneous and like displacements will be
