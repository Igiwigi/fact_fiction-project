Lastly, as proof that the ambulacral feet of Zchinus are under the control of 8ome
centralising apparatus when executing the righting manceuyre, we may state one
other fact. When the righting manceuvre is nearly completed by the rows engaged in
executing it, the lower feet in the other rows become strongly protruded and curved
downwards, in anticipation of shortly coming into contact with the floor of the tank
when the righting manceuvre shall have been completed (see Plate 83, fig. 26). This
fact tends to show that all the ambulacral feet of the animal are, like all the spines,
held in mutual communication with one another by some centralising mechanism. Such, then, is the evidence we have to adduce for the purpose of showing that the
action of the ambulacral feet is not entirely or only of a serial kind, but is, in part at
all events, dependent upon some centralising influence by which all the feet, like all
the spines, are rendered capable of truly co-ordinated action. We have next to adduce
our evidence to show that the action of the ambulacral feet, although as we have
een in some measure, is not exclusively dependent on this centralising influence.

(E.) In order to show this we must- first narrate the experiments whereby we 8uc-
. ceeded in ascertaining the central apparatus, on the integrity of which both the feet
and the spines depend for their co-ordination.
