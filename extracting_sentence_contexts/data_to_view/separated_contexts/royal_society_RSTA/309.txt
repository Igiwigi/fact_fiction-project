Its cellular counterpart, the slow (<1 Hz) sleep
oscillation, occurs quasi-synchronously in all types of cortical neurons, in the
glutamatergic thalamocortical (TC) neurons of various sensory and intralaminar
thalamic nuclei and in the GABAergic cells of the nucleus reticularis thalami
(NRT), and consists of regularly repeating depolarizing sequences (most often
with firing) interspersed with hyperpolarizations (with no firing) at a low (0.2
0.9 Hz) frequency [5-7], nowadays commonly referred to as UP and DOWN states,
respectively (figure 1). The physiological importance of the slow (<1 Hz) oscillation is highlighted by
its presence throughout all stages of NREM sleep both in humans [1,3,4,8,9] and
in animals [10-13]. In fact, the electroencephalogram (EEG) K-complex (of stage
2 sleep) represents a single cycle of the slow oscillation, with its surface EEG-
negative and -positive phases (corresponding to depth EEG-positive and -nega-

ive) simply reflecting the DOWN state and the start of the UP state, respectively,
of the oscillation [14-16]. Sleep spindles (of stage 2-3 sleep) frequently occur
immediately after, or are superimposed on, the depth-negative peak of the EEG
wave, i.e. at the start the slow oscillation UP state [17-19]. As sleep deepens, the
‘requency of the slow oscillation, and thus that of K-complexes, increases until
it develops into the slow waves of deep NREM sleep [19].
