Children who did not co-
construct during reading also did not use enrichments in the
test situation. The question of how this enrichment contributes
to the acquisition of the word remains unanswered. In fact, we
could not find any correlation between the co-construction in
reading and the test scores. We can only argue that the picture
test can be considered as a further learning situation in which
the child deepens their ability to distinguish the semantic

concept of mercy from closely related concepts to mark relevant
aspects. For such learning, the use of enrichment appears to be
meaningful.
