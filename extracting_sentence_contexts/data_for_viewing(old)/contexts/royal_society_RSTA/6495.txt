that often. The Holocene began more than 11000 years ago after the last glacial period and saw
the dawn of human civilization. Before that the Pleistocene lasted for 2.5 million years [1]. It saw
both major climate change and a massive extinction of life forms: those two facts are connected.

The Anthropocene—the epoch which started when humans first began to have a significant
impact on Earth’s climate, geology and ecosystems—is itself a much-contested concept. There
is a live debate about when it started. Some argue that we should go as far back as 10000 or
so years to the shift from hunter-gatherers to settled farmers [2]. Others say the Anthropocene
truly began about 250 years ago with the industrial revolution, as the western world’s new fossil
fuel-powered economy began to drive up global temperatures. And there are those who prefer
to wait until the 1950s when the acceleration of fossil fuel use, deforestation, ocean acidification,
urbanization, industrial-scale agriculture, habitat destruction, species extinction and wide-scale
natural resource extraction made it finally incontestable that we had now significantly modified
our planet [2]. But whenever the Anthropocene did start, what no-one seriously contests is that
we're in it now.
