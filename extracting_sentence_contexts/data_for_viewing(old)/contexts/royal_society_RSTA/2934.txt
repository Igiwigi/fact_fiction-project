an estimation of the inductance nonlinearity.

As shown in equation (2.14), a decrease in the inductance value with respect to the current : 5.

amplitude is required. Magnetic saturation can actually offer such a nonlinear dependence
because the inductance is directly related to the magnetic flux ®. While & = L@ ina linear case, as
a more general rule

P (i max) = Lo(Gmax)q + Log? + Lag? +--+ - (3.1)
The constants L; are used to build an odd Taylor series approximating the nonlinear behaviour : =
of a magnetic field subjected to saturation. Also note, in Lo(Gmax), the dependence on qmax, which : =
refers to the maximum amplitude of the current q. This represents the fact that, even before 1B
saturation, we observe a variation of the inductance that does not directly depend on q but on its : =
maximum value. In practice, inductors made of ferrite magnetic material generate an equivalent : a
inductance which first increases before saturation occurs. At such a low current, the relationship Dy
between © and q remains linear but the slope increases with the amplitude of the electrical : 2
current [28]. This effect is due to a physical phenomenon called ‘wall movements’ at the scale :3
of the magnetic domains [29]. For this reason, the initial inductance Lo can be described by a : =

second Taylor series which depends on the maximum current through
Lo(Gmax) = Loo + Lomax + Lo2qnax + °° 7 (3.2)

a monotonically increasing function from Log to a maximum value Lo(G@max > 0) = L9°. If only
the first harmonic of the current q* = Qcos(wt — 64) is retained, we have qf,ax = Q so
