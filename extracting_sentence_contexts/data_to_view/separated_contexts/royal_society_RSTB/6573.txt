I have avoided so far as possible drawing conclusions concerning the status of the
brains of the Australian aboriginal. The literature abounds in suggestions as to

inferiority and primitiveness, and in most cases the conclusions are unfounded. One cannot, however, here resist commenting on the fact that the inferior frontal
region is obviously different in the Australian from what it is in the other two races
with which it is compared. CunnincHAM shows that the separation of the two
sulci occurs more commonly in the foetal brain than in the adult ; but even in the
eighth-month foetus the separation is only in 50-2°%, of cases in the European as
compared with 83°, in the Australian adult. TaBLE X—CONFLUENCE OF THE SULCUS PRAECENTRALIS WITH THE SULCUS FRONTALIS

Cunnincuam (1892) describes three principal varieties of this sulcus.
