intervals of five minutes for twenty-four hours on two galvanometers, one at Derby
and the other at Birmingham, each connected to the same wire.

Mr. CuiLity took the observyations at Birmingham, while I took those at Derby,
each being assisted by an intelligent telegraph clerk. In addition to the galvano-
meters, the wet and dry thermometers were also noted at every observation.

The results of these observations are given in diagram No. 1, and allowing for the
difference in delicacy of the two galvanometers, there is enough to show that the
currents were simultaneous in all their changes; it was also evident from this experi-
ment that the direction of the current was the same at both extremities of the wire.

This fact, together with those previously mentioned, indicates that the currents
which produce deflections do not arise from the transit of electricity between the
atmosphere and the earth, but that from whatever cause the currents originate, they

travel along the wires from one earth connection to the other, alternating first in one
direction and then in the other.

In examining the results obtamed from this experiment, there appeared a general
movement of the needle to the right from the commencement of the observations in
the morning until midnight, then changing over to the left until nine or ten o'clock
