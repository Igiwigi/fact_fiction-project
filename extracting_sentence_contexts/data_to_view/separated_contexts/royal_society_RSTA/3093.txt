Then we rule out splitting. If splitting occurred, then there exists y € (0,4) and a subsequence

2Except at the final phase, when the tightness is established. There, one needs to show the non-trivial fact that the translates
guaranteed by tightness are actually bounded in R?, whence it easily follows that there is a minimizer in X,.
