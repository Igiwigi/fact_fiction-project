§ 21. Effect of Cellular Structure on Moduli of Rigidity.—For all woods that have been
tested adequately it appears that prx > eur > per: the ratios of these moduli vary
considerably, but py» is always much less than the others (compare the table in § 2). A reason for these facts is to be found in the cellular structure of wood, which we have
already briefly described. ‘Thus pyr is less than yyy or pyr because it relates to strains
which involve distortion of the cross-sections of the longitudinal cells, whereas the other
moduli are concerned with the longitudinal shearing of these cells. In a similar way
vir is less than py, because an LT-plane contains the cross-sections of the cells of the
medullary rays, while an LR-plane contains the longitudinal sections of these cells.
