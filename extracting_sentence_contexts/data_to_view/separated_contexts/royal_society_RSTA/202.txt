The results are reproduced in figure 9. This confirmation
does not mean that the theory is correct, of course, but it is one hurdle that
was crossed. This reaction—diffusion model serves to explain a number of the facts, such
as the tendency for the power in the power law to be approximately -3 on the
average, and there being a cut-off for the ‘on times’, and the prediction of a
change in slope. However, how does one explain the asymmetry—why is there
not a cut-off for the ‘off’ times, or at least not an easily discernable cut-off in the
time scale of intermittency? An important new set of experiments was performed for different excitation
wavelengths at room temperature (Knappenberger et al. 2007).
