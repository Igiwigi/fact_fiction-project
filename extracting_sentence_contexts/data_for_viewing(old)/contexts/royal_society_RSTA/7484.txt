made with Ga 5, using a stiffer suspension and at y = 84-3° in the ab-plane, where the beats
were much less pronounced; under these conditions the instrumental effect could be shown
to be very small. Measurements were made at several temperatures and some of the curves
are shown in figure 6 and summarized in table 3, in which the values of 7,, r, and 7, found by
Fourier analysis of the experimental curves are compared with the values predicted by (7) ;
the relative phases of the harmonic components will be considered later (see p. 21). The

facts that the third and fourth harmonic amplitudes are appreciably different in the two
cycles analyzed at the low temperatures, and that they occur at all with appreciable ampli-
tudes at 4-22° K, may be ascribed partly to the residual influence of the beats, and partly
