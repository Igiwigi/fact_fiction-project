Indeed, Devbhandari
et al., were able to identify several proteins specifically associ- et al., who established a similar in vitro system achieved replica-
ated with replicating chromatin [11]. Most prominent were tion on chromatinized templates in the absence of FACT and
histone chaperones (FACT, Nhp6, Asf1), chromatin remodel- many of the stimulatory factors described by Kurat ef al. their
ling complexes (INO80, Isw1), and histone acetyltransferase reactions contained the histone chaperone NAP1 and Isw1,
complexes (NuA4, SAGA). Importantly, efficient replication which were included to assemble nucleosomes on the template
of chromatinized DNA required FACT, which is consistent DNA. These factors presumably also stimulated replication

with the noted role for FACT in promoting transcription through chromatin and nucleosome assembly on the nascent


DNA. Thus, while many proteins appear capable of stimulat-
ing replication, it appears that no single factor is specifically
required for replication through templates.
