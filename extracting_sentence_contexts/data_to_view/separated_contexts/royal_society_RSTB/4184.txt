38. The actual relation of the anterior end of the vomer in Macropus and
Dasyurus to the paraseptal cartilage is not that which we should expect if that bone

of the parasphenoid of reptiles, a fact which is inconsistent with Gavrrâ€™s view that
the crus longus of the parasphenoid has disappeared in mammals owing to the
