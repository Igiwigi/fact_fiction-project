STATISTICAL ESTIMATION 349

The justification lies in the character of probabilities as used here, and in the law
of great numbers. According to this empirical law, which has been confirmed by
numerous experiments, whenever we frequently and independently repeat a random
experiment with a constant probability, «, of a certain result, A, then the relative
frequency of the occurrence of this result approaches «. Now the three steps (a),
(6), and (c) recommended to the practical statistician represent a random experiment
which may result in a correct statement concerning the value of 0,. This result may
be denoted by A, and if the calculations leading to the functions @ (E) and 6 (E) are
correct, the probability of A will be constantly equal to «. In fact, the statement (c)
concerning the value of 6, is only correct when 6 (E) falls below 0,° and 6 (E),

Sabove 6,°, and the probability of this is equal to« whenever 0,°is the true value of 6.
alt follows that if the practical statistician applies permanently the rules (a), (6) and
Bc) for purposes of estimating the value of the parameter 0,, in the long run he will be
correct in about 99 per cent. of all cases.

& It is important to notice that for this conclusion to be true, it is not necessary that
Sthe problem of estimation should be the same in all the cases. For instance, during
‘=a period of time the statistician may deal with a thousand problems of estimation and
~in each the parameter 6, to be estimated and the probability law of the X’s may be
different. As far as in each case the functions 6 (E) and 6 (E) are properly calculated
