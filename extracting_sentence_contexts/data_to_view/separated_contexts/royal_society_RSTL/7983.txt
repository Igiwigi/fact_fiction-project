Ruately, the first specimen which made known to me the fact of 80 large a Wombat having

formerly existed in Australia included 2 inches 8 lines of the diastemal part of the jaw,
which contracts rapidly to the terminal outlets of the incisive alveoli (Plate XXXIX.
figs. 1 & 2); whence I conclude that but little had been broken away from that end of
the mandible. * Should any successor deem the differential characters of the giant Wombat of generic or subgeneric value,
as the minor differences of Phascolomys tatifrons have been by Dr. Mun (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1867, p. $15), they
may, perhaps, accept the name * Phascolonus,‚Äù having reference to the 8ize of this species, which equalled that,
of the Wild Ass.
