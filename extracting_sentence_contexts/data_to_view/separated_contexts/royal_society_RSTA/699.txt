Berthelot (1907) has made an investigation, based partly on theoretical and partly

on empirical grounds, of the characteristic behaviour of gases at low pressures. Using
as theoretical basis the Van der Waals’ equation of state as modified by Clausius, and
then introducing a further modification, derived from the experimental facts, con-
cerning the departures of gases from Boyle’s law at low pressures, he obtains a general
expression for the relation between 3 (which is, in effect, a measure of the departure of
gases from Avogadro's law) and temperature. It will be seen in a later section of this
paper that the value of # determined for air at pressures from 1 atm. downwards is
also found to vary with temperature, both the magnitude and the sense of the variation
agreeing reasonably well with the expectations from Berthelot’s theory.
