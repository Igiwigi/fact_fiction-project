WALKER ON BOOMERANGS.

angle, the more difficult is the throwing of the implement, and when 2a = 150° or
upwards, and the material of which the boomerang is made is light, throwing it
against a wind requires skill of a high order. The values of the constants /,, mg, «,... have been calculated for boomerangs whose
arms are 36 centims. in length and 5 centims. in width, the mass per unit area being
five-eighths of a gramme. When these constants are substituted in the equations of steady motion, it is found
that for a boomerang whose arms are at right angles, corresponding to the values

U = 2000, n = 40, cUi='7, NUA SS 5;

are the velocities

If we make n = 30, the values of 9, 9), w given by the equations are too large ;
this is due to the fact that the theoretical limit of stability (n= 22) is not sufficiently
exceeded. If the value of «U be taken as 5 instead of 7 (these being estimated inferior and
superior limits of kU corresponding to c = 6, f= 1/6, and c= 7, f = 1/5) there
