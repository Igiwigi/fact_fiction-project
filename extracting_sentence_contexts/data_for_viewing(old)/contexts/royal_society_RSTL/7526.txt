walls, and the sixth and seventh to the right and left lateral walls *. The most external
and most internal loops are confined principally to one or other of the aspects indicated ;
but the deeper or more central loops radiate and expand towards the apex and base, 80
that they come to embrace the entire circumference of the bladder in these directions.
The expansion referred to is greatest towards the apex, and the aggregation of the
terminal loops of the anterior and posterior fibres at the cervix (assisted by the lateral
ones) form a well-marked sphincter in this situation. The sphincter is bilaterally
symmetrical and oval in shape, the long axis being directed transyersely, or from side
to side, as represented at mm, yy of fig. 11, Plate ITI., and 7 y of diagrams 10 & 20,
Plate V. The two sets of lateral fibres (Plate V. diagram 10, z 7, vs) which assist
in the formation of the sphincter, intersect the angles formed by the crossing of the
anterior and posterior fibres, and render its aperture somewhat circular in appearance.
This cireumstance, taken in connexion with the fact that the fibres pursue a yery
oblique direction, has given rise to the belief that the fibres of the sphineter and neck
of the bladder generally are circular fibres, which is not the case. The fibres of the
sphincter are best seen by inverting the bladder and dissecting from within, or by
making transverse sections of the prostatic portion of the urethra in the direction of the
fundus (Plate IV, figs. 19 & 20, m). 'They are most strongly pronounced at the cervix,
but are continued forward on the urethra, and backwards into the bladder. In the
female they extend even to the meatus urinarius. 'The apex and base of the bladder
are similarly constructed, and resemble in their general configuration the other por-
tions of the vesical walls; 7. e. they are composed of longitudinal or vertical, slightly
oblique, oblique, and very oblique spiral fibres, which cross in all directions externally
and internally (Plate IV. figs. 13, 14 & 15). The longitudinal or vertical, slightly
oblique, oblique, and very oblique external and internal fibres at the base are continued
