had different responses, one, for example, having a maximum in the yellow, another in the
green and a third in the blue, then it would be anticipated that a maximum would be
discovered by micro-stimulation in the part of the spectrum corresponding to the maximum
of the cone on which the greater part of the light was incident. At the same time there
would beâ€™feebler maxima produced by the neighbouring cones, if any appreciable amount
of the light happened to fall on them. But these weak maxima would not seriously interfere
with the detection of the strong maximum produced by the cone on which the main part
of the light was falling. In other words, the interconnexion of the retinal cones, so that their
impulses are conveyed up one optic nerve fibre, should not interfere to a serious extent with
the type of observation which it is intended to make in this research.

While it would be idle to deny that potential connexions such as Polyak has described
may exist, in fact the evidence for the existence of such connexions appears to be entirely
lacking. It has been shown in a previous section (130) that it appears to be possible to
stimulate the retina with a point of light so small that almost all of it falls on one foveal
cone. When this is done there is no indication that there is any spreading of the image,
either due to optical phenomena or to neurological interconnexions. If in fact spreading

takes place, its effect must be entirely eliminated by the visual centres of the brain.
