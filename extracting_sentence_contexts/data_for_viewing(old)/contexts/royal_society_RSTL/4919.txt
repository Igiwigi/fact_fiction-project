Qdelicate fibres may also be observed joining them together, and forming a close mesh,
n which are deposited numerous dotted corpuscles, and a quantity of fine dark granules.
SFrom this time, up to the completion of incubation, no change takes place in the
Structure of these glands, From the preceding observations it is scen that the supra-
Henal glands are developed by two separate masses of blastema, which are situated
Setween the upper and inner extremities of the Wolffian bodies and the sides of the
-Horta, but which are totally independent (as far as concerns their development) of
Zthose bodies, or of each other. It is also seen that their minute structure at an
Zarly period closely corresponds with the structure of the spleen ; and although the
"Supra-renal glands attain their maximum degree of development at an earlier period
Stan that organ, as regards the formation 'of its vesicles, still exactly the same pro-
Sees can be followed. in the spleen as regards the development of the Malpighian
Fyesicles ; a fact which, I think, tends to prove the great similarity of the organs in

£ Development of the Thyroid Glands.

© The evolution of the thyroid gland, like the spleen and supra-renal capsules, is in-
Solved in great obscurity.

E The following are the principal accounts of its development that have yet been
Bgiven.

According to Huscnks* the thyroid gland is developed from the anterior branchial
arches ; no other observer however has verified his statement, and RaTHKE altogether
