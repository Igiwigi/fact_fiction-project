experimental results obtained may be readily explained by the appreciable solubility

of calcium oxalate in the relatively concentrated solution of salts from which it was
precipitated.

(5) Estumation of Glycollic Acid.—Since no specific method is available for the
estimation of glycollic acid, advantage was taken of the fact that glycollic acid is the
only product of the action of iodine on kojie acid which contains a hydroxyl group
which can be acetylated by means of acetic anhydride and sodium acetate, to estimate
the acid by this means. Preliminary experiments with pure glycollic acid had shown
that this reaction provides a reasonably satisfactory quantitative method.

The experimental details (amounts of kojic acid, reagents, etc.) are the same as those
used in the preparation of the reaction mixture for the estimation of oxalic acid.
When the reaction was complete the solution was acidified with 50 c.c. of N/1 sulphuric
acid and the iodine and iodoform extracted with ether. The iodide was precipitated by
means of silver carbonate, the excess silver removed by hydrochloric acid, the solution
filtered, neutralised and evaporated to low bulk im vacuo. The residual solution was
washed into a 250 ¢.c. round-bottomed flask and evaporated to dryness in a gentle
