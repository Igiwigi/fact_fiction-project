Figs. 6-8 represent three stages in the early development of ambulacrum III or V
Thus column a in this series corresponds to column 6 in the figures given in a previous
paper for Echinus (Gordon, 1926, a, p. 291, figs. 21-27). The pore-pairs are still
arranged uniserially in each column when the corona measures 2-5 mm. in diameter
(fig. 6). Pore 10 is still simple and is, moreover, incomplete owing to the fact that the
calcite on the peristomial margin has undergone resorption. The spheridium (s.) on
plate la is now situated in a depression or pit ; when first formed it is placed super-
ficially as in the imago of Echinus miliaris. Triads B and C in column a@ and C in
column b are of the arbacioid type, the others each possess two primaries and a demiplate.
