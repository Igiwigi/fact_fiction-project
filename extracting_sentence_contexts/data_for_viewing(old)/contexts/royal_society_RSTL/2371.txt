drawn out at a lamp to form a slender needle about
8ix inches long, which is to be snspended by the middle by a fine thread of
glass. Place two slender pieces of glass at each end of the horizontal needle,
to prevent it having much motion. Twist the thread a little till the needle
rest against the opposite supports. Place its pith ball D between B, C. Heat
about a foot of A B in the middle, place the rod on an insulating support,
with A near the prime conductor, and bring it rapidly to its former position.
Turn the index till the attraction of B just overcomes that of C, continue to
turn the machine, and the attraction of B will diminish s0 that the ball D will
move off to C as the iron cools. From this experiment, it would seem that
iron when heated is a better conductor of the electric fluid than when cold.
The following experiment, which I have repeated at least ten times with uni-
formly the same results, will place this fact beyond the possibility of doubt.

Exe. VIII. Bring two brass balls connected with the earth near the balls
B, C, (the part E being heated red hot,) till the electric fluid swrike off almost
equally to both ; allow E to cool, and the electricity will cease striking off
from B, and the whole will flow off in rapid sparks from C. The experiment
may be rendered till more striking, by making the whole electricity at first
