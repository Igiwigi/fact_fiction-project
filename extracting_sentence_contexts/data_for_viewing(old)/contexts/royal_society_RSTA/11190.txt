the binary electrolyte in question is the haloid salt itself.

Again, the approximately equal conductivity of the oxysalts of any one metal which
approaches that of the hydrates, indicates that in the flame they are changed into the
same electrolysable substance, which we conclude is the hydroxide or oxide.

At the same time, whilst we recognise the haloid salts as being present to a con-
siderable extent undecomposed in the flame, and acting as electrolytes, the fact that
at high dilution the haloid salts and oxysalts alike of any one metal have the same
conducting power, makes it probable that under these circumstances the haloid salts
have also been converted into hydroxides, thus giving a common dissociating body.

The fact that potassium iodide at higher concentrations has a greater conductivity
than potassium chloride, or bromide, is compatible with the greater readiness with
which this salt is acted upon by oxidising agents. Whilst the chloride and bromide
preserve their individuality, the iodide is largely converted into the oxide, which has
a higher conductivity.

Coming lastly to the question whether the luminosity in flames coloured by salt
vapours is connected with their electrical conductivity, we think our observations on
flames containing chloroform give a definite decision in the negative.

The addition of chloroform to a flame produces hydrochloric acid. Now the
conductivity of a flame containing either chloroform or hydrochloric acid, but no
salt, is shown by our experiments (see p. 121) to be extremely small. Since in a
