In the subsequent phase rapid growth in weight correlated
with that of the testes occurs. During both phases the relation evidently approxi-
mates to a straight line regression although the spread in the second phase is
considerable. It is apparent, therefore, that the growth of the seminal vesicles and
prostate relative to that of the testes at the onset of the breeding season exhibits
a marked lag, and does not, in fact, begin until the testes have attained a compara-
tively large size and considerably after the stage at which mature spermatozoa are
found both in the testes and epididymides. Since no animals with testes 250 mg
in weight and over were obtained before March 24, and all animals obtained after
April 16 and before the appearance of young animals of the season had testes over
this weight, it shows that the growth of the seminal vesicles and prostate begins during
this period. The data for the months of September and October, when the reproductive
organs of mature animals are rapidly regressing at the close of the breeding season,
are given in Table IX.
