the instant of expulsion ; as is shown in the mode of intercourse of the sexes in that
animal, and in the fact that, if the fecundatory fluid be not immediately applied to
the strings of ova as these are passed, the unsprinkled ova are infertile. The oviposi-
tion of the Toad is an exceedingly slow process, and usually lasts, as SPALLANzanz
obseryed, from ten to fifteen hours: in one instance I found it continued during
seventeen hours, but it was completed in others in eight or ten. The act of impreg-
nation, therefore, is necessarily also prolonged. But the length of time during which
the spermatozoa continue eflicient to impregnate after remoyal from the body, is
shorter than in the Frog. SPALLANZANI found that, at a temperature of 81* Fanr,,
it does not exceed fifteen minutes. I also have noticed that the motions of the
spermatozoa cease much earlier than in the spermatozoa of the Frog.

Thus the conelusions to be drawn from the facts of natural impregnation in the
Toad, fully agree with those deduced from artificial impregnation in the Frog, and
seem to establish the view, that while an increase of temperature is required for the
fulfilment of the reproductive function in that animal, and to maintain the efficiency
of the spermatozoa, the fecundatory force of the agent is of shorter duration, and
corresponds to its more early cessation of motion,

13. PENETRATION BY THE SPERMATOZOON IN EFFECTING FECUNDATION.

The penetration of the spermatozoon into the substance of the egg, or even into
its envelopes, has been s0 much disputed, and $0 repeatedly denied, that it is only on
what may perhaps be regarded as indisputable evidence, that any one ought to re-
assert it. Up to a very recent period I could not, myself, admit it as probable ;
