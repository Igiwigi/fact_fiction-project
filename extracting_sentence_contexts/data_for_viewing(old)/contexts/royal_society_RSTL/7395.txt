animals before immersion in spirits of wine, in which condition, owing to their poisonoug
effects upon me, T have never been able to examine them. The colour was in all pro»
bability due to the fluid contained within the vessels. I have looked for similar trany
verse vessels in many Nematoids, but have only found them in the two above named;
SCHNEIDER, however, states that he has discovered them in Heterakis vesicularis, and.
many other minute Nematoids, though he has failed to recognize them in any species of
the genera Ozyuris or Strongylus. Further investigation, both with regard to the con
nexions of these vessels, and to their prevalence amongst the Nematoids generally, would
be most desirable.

THE RESPIRATORY FUNCTIION—HOW PERFORMED ?

Amonegst the lower Invertebrata it is a well-known fact that the function of respiratiol
is effected by the most dissimilar means, and often by distinct processes working inde-
pendently in the same animal towards the fulfilment of a similar end. We need nob
be surprised therefore if 81ch is found to be the case amongst the Nematoids. It is
however, rather remarkable that cilia, which often (as first pointed out by Dr. SHaraY ®)
play 80 important a part in the respiratory processes of the invertebrate animals, should
never yet have been detected in any Nematoid either parasitic or free.

The function of respiration seems to be duplicate in its nature: one object which ib
fulfils in the animal economy being to secure a certain amount of oxidation of the
tissues, and the other being the performance of a function of elimination, supplemental
in its nature to the similar work effected by the two other great excretory organs, the
kidneys and liverF. It may well be that the relative proportions of these two proces
