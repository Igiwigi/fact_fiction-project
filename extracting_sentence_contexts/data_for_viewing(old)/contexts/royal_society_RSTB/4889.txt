Now suppose that chance can be ignored, that the number of species in a genus can be
taken as a continuous variable, and that the above can be taken as absolute functional
relations. The size of a genus is then absolutely determined by its age, and we can
find the number of genera of each size by eliminating ¢ from the first relation. We have

The method of approach was obviously exceedingly crude, but it suggested
logarithmic plotting of the data. Further trial showed that the law did in fact hold

very approximately, both for animals and plants, up to genera of 30 species or so, after
which the points began to drop away more or less rapidly from the line, i.e., the
observed frequencies of the larger genera were smaller than those suggested by the
law : figs. 2 and 3 (below, pp. 45, 46) bring out the point very well. The approximation
was, however, sufficiently close to encourage further work. As will be seen from the
following, the fundamental mistake was the notion that time might be regarded for
practical purposes as infinite : it must in fact be regarded as quite short.
