1. INTRODUCTION During the study of the biology of two hymenopterous parasites which were being bred
with a view to their utilization as biological control agents, certain interesting facts were
observed with regard to the occurrence of diapause. It was found that the age of the parent
female when an egg was laid had some influence on the tendencies of the larval progeny to
enter diapause. This effect has already been briefly described (Simmonds 1946).
