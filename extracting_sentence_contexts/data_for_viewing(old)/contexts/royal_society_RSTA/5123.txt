Keywords: success of modern macromolecular crystallography, for
X-ray, synchrotron, free-electron laser, example, relies on the fact that an X-ray photon has
angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy, an electric field, giving rise to elastic scattering from

understand the wide utility enjoyed by X-ray imaging

in its most commonly realized forms, to take a second

example, it is enough to appreciate that an X-ray can also
