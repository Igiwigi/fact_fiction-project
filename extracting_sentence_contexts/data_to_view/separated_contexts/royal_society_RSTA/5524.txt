The first inequality in (3.11) is the same as that derived from the four-fifths law [14]. The
second inequality C(imin) = 4 also provides a bound on the probability of observing the smallest
exponent which has a very low probability of occurrence [18]. Note that for d= 3, the condition
for n=m=1 reflects the fact that the energy dissipation is bounded, as stressed in [16]. Thus,
we can say that while the hierarchy of bounds derived in theorem 1 gives a lower bound? on h,
which is expressed in (3.9), the lower bound C(h) in (3.11) is no better than that derived from the
four-fifths law. We see also that the exponent corresponding to Leray scaling, namely Imin = â€”1, is only
achieved at the singular dimension d=4.
