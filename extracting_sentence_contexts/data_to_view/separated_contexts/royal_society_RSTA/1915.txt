Rocks of such high susceptibilities are certain to cause magnetic disturbances. Further, such rocks need not occur in exceptionally large quantity in order to cause
disturbances such as those at Rempstone and Melton, measured by 170y. A difficulty arises from the fact that the central coarser portion of the Owthorpe
dolerite shows the extremely low susceptibility 9x 10-*. This value is exceptionally
low for a doleritic rock, but it may be purely local and due to the particular form
taken by the iron-ores present in the rock (see p. 105).
