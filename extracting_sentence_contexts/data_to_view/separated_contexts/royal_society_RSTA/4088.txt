As the experimental set-up
corresponds to the limit described by equation (3.9), this expansion will be dominated by terms
with the lowest possible order in the weak interaction, i.e. k = 2:

(L) : + Lew (x) | . (3.14)

Equation (3.14) indicates that, beyond the very short-time expansion, i.e. (ty/N) <t < ty, the
dependence on ts becomes superseded by the diverging terms in the scale T2. This could lead to
the new time scale T3, which was seen experimentally to be tied to T2 as

T2 $13 Ktz. (3.15)

In that sense, T3 becomes characteristic of the complexity or ‘chaos’ of the many-spin system
that amplifies the small effect of the perturbation. In addition, it is important to stress that,
being an experimental fact, equation (3.15) corresponds to a system composed by infinitely many
interacting spins. In other words, equation (3.15) stands for the relations of time scales in the
thermodynamic limit. Quite on the contrary, any numerical simulation involves a finite, very
small indeed, number of spins where the irreversibility rate T; would be essentially given by
ts.
