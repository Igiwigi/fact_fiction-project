An infinitely thin plate of finite dimensions magnetized longitudinally. If F be the component of the earth's magnetism in the plane, and perpendicular to
any part of the edge, we shall have a distribution of red magnetism on the northern edge
of the plate, of blue magnetism on the southern ; and if nz be the thickness of the plate,
then the force exerted by a part of the blue edge of length ds, or a red particle at a
distance 7, will be "

zF = 64

and the effect of the whole edge will be given by ordinary integration. Such a plate
Smay in fact be considered as a collection of thin iron rods laid side by side, parallel to
Sthe direction of the component of the earth's force which we are considering.

- 3. An infinite plate of finite thickness magnetized perpendicularly. S Tet F be the component of the earth's force perpendicular to the plate.

2 The northern surface of the plate will have a distribution of red free magnetism, the

Southern surface of blue; the amount of each on an element of surface =dS being

= xF FR
= 15 + 47x GS.
5 Each surface will exercise a force in a direction perpendicular to the plate of | HE F

Son a red particle anywhere situate.
