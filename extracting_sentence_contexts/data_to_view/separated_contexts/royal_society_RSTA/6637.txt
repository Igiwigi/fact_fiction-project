The system benzene-diphenyl, which was chosen for the present study, is one in which the
solute molecule diphenyl consists of two units of the solvent molecule benzene, and appears
to be suitable for a test of the theoretical formulae. However, it is not entirely satisfactory,
since the theory would apply exactly only if the molar volume of diphenyl were twice that of
benzene. It is, in fact, less than this by about 15%. Moreover, the units, in this case phenyl
groups, are not spherical. From the experimental aspect the system is easy to handle;
diphenyl has a conveniently low vapour pressure, and both components can be obtained
pure without much difficulty.
