When
pressure is applied to this translucent film, the compressed metal becomes either opake
or of a very dark purple colour, and resumes its high reflective power. If a higher heat
than that necessary for this first change be applied, then the leaf, viewed in the micro-
cope, assumes a mottled appearance, as if a retraction into separate parts had occurred. At a till higher temperature this effect is increased ; but the heat, whether applied in
the muffle or by a blowpipe, which is necessary to fuse the metal and make it run
together in globules, is very much higher than that which causes the first change of the
s1lver: the latter is, in fact, below s8uch a red heat as is Jjust visible in the dark. What-
ever the degree of heat applied, the metal remains as metallic silver during the whole
time. When many silver leaves were laid loosely one upon another, rolled up into a loose
coil, introduced into a glass tube, and the whole placed in a muffle and heated carefully
for three or four hours to 80 low a degree that the glass tube had not been softened or
deformed, it was found that the silver-deaf had sunk together a little and shaped itself
in some degree upon the glass, touching by points here and there, but not adhering to

it.
