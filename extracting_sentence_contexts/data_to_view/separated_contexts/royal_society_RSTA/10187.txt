Thus the emanation on leaving the ground in cold weather cannot
rise, but collects in the lower atmosphere, causing the high winter values of the radio-
activity. The reason why the radio-activity is high with high relative humidity is easily
found when one considers that each evening, as the temperature rapidly falls, two
things happen: first there is a rapid rise in the relative humidity and secondly
ascending currents of air are cut off. The latter fact gives rise to the high radio-
activity. Also a mist or fog is always a sign of stagnant air. A high wind is naturally accompanied by low activity, for it acts as a stirrer, and
rapidly mixes the escaped emanation with a large volume of air.
