This means that the likelihood function can have pronounced peaks even well away from Xo. In our glacial cycle application, the orbital forcing, which varies solar insolation in the Northern
Hemisphere, has exactly this effect, and hence our likelihood function for Xo is both extremely
peaky, and also not concentrated around Xp. In fact, the situation can be more complicated still,
as there may be several local pullback attractors at any given time. The presence of many local maxima implies that the basin of attraction of the global
maximum of the likelihood function, which will contain Xo with high probability, is only a small
fraction of the volume of 4. Hence, we are unlikely to find the global maximum of the likelihood
using steepest ascent from an arbitrary starting point.
