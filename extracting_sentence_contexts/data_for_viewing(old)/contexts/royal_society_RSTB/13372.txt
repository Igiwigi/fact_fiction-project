(b) Plugs and other mechanisms to prevent remating terns of investment across diverse taxa, particularly because
Mating plugs formed from seminal fluid secretions are taxono- many other (non-plug) seminal fluid proteins are also known
mically widespread, being found for example in several to influence female remating propensities [64,72].


(c) Spermatophores and nuptial gifts
Taxa in which ejaculates are delivered as an external spermato-
phore make interesting case studies for studying seminal fluid
investment patterns, because in these species seminal fluid
can potentially influence female physiology and behaviour
both via the ‘usual’ route when seminal fluid components are
taken up into the female reproductive tract together with
sperm, as well as by virtue of the fact that they may be ingested
by the female as a nuptial gift. (Note that others have argued
that all seminal fluid-mediated effects could fall under the
definition of ‘nuptial gifts’, in which case what I refer to here
would be just one—endogenous, oral—sub-category [73].)
One advantage of such study systems is that is possible to
directly recover and quantify the seminal fluid contribution to
the ejaculate [6]. Among bushcrickets for example, comparative
analyses do not appear to support a strong correlation between
testis mass and spermatophylax mass [46] but do suggest that
spermatophylax mass correlates positively with ampulla
mass [43,45], which may be because depositing a larger sperma-
tophylax enables more sperm to be transferred from the
