Had it been possible to remove the load from
each little portion of the specimen as soon as the yielding which occurs at a
yield-point had spread throughout that portion of material, then probably the
yielding at the third and fourth yield-points would not have been different from
that at the first two. The extra extension at the higher yield-points was in all
likelihood due to creeping, which continued after the break-down which occurs at a
yield-point had taken place. In fact the elongation obtained at the fourth yield-
point shown in Diagram No. 2 would have been greater still had not the load been
removed shortly after the large yielding action had spread throughout the length
of the specimen. Had this not been done, creeping would have continued, and
probably fracture would have supervened, for previous experiments had shown that
there was considerable danger of fracture occurring when a yield-point was passed
at a high stress. *
