ZYGOPTERID TREE-FERNS FROM WESTERN SIBERIA. 455

differs in the absence of the long spidery arms so characteristic of that genus, and in
the much greater development of the “ mixed pith.”

As stated, the final form of the petiolar trace is decidedly like that of Clepsydropsis. There is not the least sign of a curvature, and the peripheral loops are so placed that
the strand has two planes of symmetry, one radial (anteroposterior), the other tangential. In view of these facts, it is surprising that the leaf-trace at its origin is a solid or nearly
solid strand, and the peripheral loops usually do not make their appearance till after
the protoxylem has bifurcated. There is thus no stage quite corresponding to the
flattened ring of “ C.” australis, nor is there at any time the remotest sign of a curvature
in the leaf-trace. The different stages in the formation of the leaf-trace can be followed
in a single cross-section of the trunk by comparing strands more or less removed from
the stele.
