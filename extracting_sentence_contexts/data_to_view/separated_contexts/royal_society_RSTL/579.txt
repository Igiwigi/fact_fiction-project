But, although the integrals of many expressions can thus be
exhibited, yet such series are useless for the purpose of arith-
metical computation, except their terms continually decrease,
and except the limits of the ratio of the decrease of the- terms
can be determined; and the invention of series adapted to
arithmetical computation, has not been the least of the difficulties
encountered by modern analysts. Although the differential expressions that admit no finite inte-
gration have not been reduced into classes, yet there are Some,
from their simplicity, and frequent occurrence in analytical in-

vestigation, more conspicuously known and attentively congi-

D In the application of the differential calculus to curve lines,

S perbolic areas, and arcs of circles, may be computed from the
Z integrals of the expressions =, Ez; the integrals of which

E: tween circles, hyperbolas, and the integrals 72 Te =—, have
EZ expressed the integrals by the arcs and areas of those figures.
