These ranges furnish another argument in favour of the meridional diurnal variation
of the wind having an origin independent of that of the land- and sea-breeze; for if both
were a consequence of the same local influences, they would most probably vary in such

* The fact that the curve (fig. 8) attains its maximum s0uth position not long after noon (the time when any
particular place is receiving heat, most, rapidly from the sun), and before (not after) the time of maximum tem-
perature, which occurs about 144 hours, appears to point to a direct action of the heated air in expanding itself
outwards as well as upwards ; for if the south current were produced solely in the manner 8uggested by Sir
Jons HErscnxr, we should expect it to attain its maximum strength after the time of maximum temperature,
not before it. The same feature which has here been pointed out, as appertaining to fig. 8 will iercafter bo 8en
to exist in similar curves for other places (ee figs.
