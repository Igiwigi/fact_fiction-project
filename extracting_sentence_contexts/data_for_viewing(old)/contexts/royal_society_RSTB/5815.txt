In the fully formed bundle the process is essentially the same (figs. 32-37, Plate 8,
and figs. 3-5). The two initial strands lie in one plane, parallel to the vertical bar from
which they have just come off. There is no indication that they are hook-like processes

detached from the ends of the bar, as BERTRAND supposed. Very soon after their
origin they unite to form one elongated bundle, but only to separate again almost imme-
diately. In fact, the whole process, down to the details, is like that in the form-genus
Etapteris as originally defined by Brrtranp.*

(c) Form and Structure of the Pinne.—There is little to add to StenzEL’s description
of the pinne, except to elucidate their mode of branching, which was left in doubt.
SreNzEL suggests that the pinne branched in one of the two following ways: either
there was a median axis from which segments came off in two lateral rows, as in a
pinnate leaf, or the pinne were flabellate organs, with the segments diverging from the
base. The latter view is no doubt nearer the truth. Examination of the material
(including Srenzex’s original specimen) leads to the conclusion that the mode of
