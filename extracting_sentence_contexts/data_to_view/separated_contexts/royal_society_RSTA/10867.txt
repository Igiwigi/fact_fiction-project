At the commencement
of the paper d/dx was shown to be a combinatorial symbol, in that when operating
upon a power of «, the said power being positive and integral, it had the effect of
summing the results obtained by substituting unity for « in all possible ways in the
product of w's, Now the corresponding operator of the calculus of finite differences,


THE FOUNDATIONS OF A NEW THEORY. 377

viz., A operates upon a power of « by striking out one «, twoa’s, three a's, &c., in all
possible ways and summing the results. Thus

Aa’ = pera + apie + waa + axa + wan + wee + wee = 8a° + Ba +1. This simple fact shows that we may expect a corresponding theory of lattices, and
that this is, in fact, the case is seen immediately one introduces the part zero into
the partitions of the functions. I have introduced zero parts into partitions in the
Memoirs on Symmetric Functions above alluded to, and have imported into the theory
the corresponding operators d, and D,.* It was there shown that, if n be the
number of quantities of which the symmetric functions are formed,

d a
d, = 7,’ Do =e —1;

and thence it appears that we have operations Do, dy, 1 + D) corresponding to the
operations 4, d/dn, E of the calculus of finite differences. Considering partitions which only involve zero parts, we have only finite difference
operations ; if we have other integers, we have mixed operations drawn both from
the finite and infinitesimal calculus.
