be very obliquely directed inwards. It is very certain that in a large number of
Palewozoie genera the spines are directed horizontally inwards as in Pholidophyllum,
and thus the idea gained ground, rather awkwardly expressed sometimes, that the
septum was a “two-leaved ‘ structure’ taking origin in a fold from the wall.”

These examples suffice to exemplify the structure of the Paleozoic “ Rugosa.” To
judge from the few detailed figures of longitudinal thin sections and the far greater
number of good transverse sections, their structure was even tn microscopic features
identical with that presented in recent Madreporaria.

In so far as septa are concerned, I recognized in the Table of Classification five
leading types, viz. (1) Astraid; (2) Eupsammid; (3) Turbinolid; (4) Madreporid ;
(5) Poritid. The facts which I gather from sections of Palswozoic* septa lead

Cystiphyllide, and Zaphrentide.

me to recognize in the majority of species referred to the genus Cyathophyllum, the
antetypes of the Astraide. Amongst allied Cyathophyllid genera, antetypes are
yielded of the Mesozoic representatives of the Fungide, whilst the Zaphrentids seem
to me more directly the structural forerunners of the Turbinolide, and the colony-
