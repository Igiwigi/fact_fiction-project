atmosphere, well lighted and heated, a great number of large intumescences are
formed in a couple of days.

The importance of uminaiion in Hibiscus is shown by the fact that intumescences
will form under clear glass, red, yellow, and white-washed glass, but not under blue
or green glass, nor in a poor light, nor in darkness. But in some later experiments
with Populus tremula, Kistrr’s* results seem to show that light is not necessary in
all cases: these exceptional results will be examined subsequently.

Again, a high temperature is necessary in the case of Hibiscus, but not in that of
Populus tremula. Still, my experiments with various plants, including Populus
tremula, show that, ceteris paribus, intumescences form more rapidly at a high than
a low temperature, though the minimum temperature varies in different plants.

The present paper is partly experimental, and is partly concerned with a
consideration of the biological factors—i.e., the state of the plant, and especially with
