error, therefore, is only of the order of 1 in 10,000 with sulphur dioxide, and with the
gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, ethylene, or any similar gas the maximum
possible error due to adsorption would only be about 1 in 60,000 which is almost
beyond the limit of working.

It is interesting to note, in connexion with the compensation of the balance by
trial and error, that the actual measured area of the quartz surface appears to bear
very little resemblance to the area of surface available for adsorption. The state
of the quartz surface, that is, whether it is drawn, fused, or polished, is of very much
greater importance. In the final microbalance, for instance, the ratio of the two
surfaces at each end of the beam was about three to four, the larger surface being
the blown buoyancy bulb and the smaller a fused quartz coverslip. This is prob-
ably due to the fact that the bulb has a more continuous surface than the coverslip,
which had presumably been rolled, and was therefore slightly pitted or corrugated.
Evidence in favour of this view was gained in the final compensation, when a number
of bulbs of different sizes was tried. It was found in one case that a small, rather
imperfectly blown bulb with a quite definite “ bloom” on its surface adsorbed
more sulphur dioxide than a bulb of larger radius with a smooth, clean surface.
It is extremely important that all the quartz surfaces be clean and free from the
white bloom which so easily appears on quartz when it is worked in the oxygen-gas
blowpipe flame. Under working conditions the balance and its weights are taken
down and washed in various organic solvents, then in concentrated nitric acid
about every three wecks. The drying is carried out in a small tubular electric
furnace.
