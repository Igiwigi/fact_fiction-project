5 Tabit and Conformation of Plants : Organisation by means of which they maintain
{a} or improve their position, or suecumb in competition with others.

Before passing to the consideration of individual species, a few general remarks.on
the structure and mode of life of the plants with which we have to deal are requisite.
All the plants are, indeed, well known, and many of the facts we have to call
attention to are equally familiar. Nevertheless, it is important to note the points of
greatest significance in the consideration of the endowments by virtue of which plants
