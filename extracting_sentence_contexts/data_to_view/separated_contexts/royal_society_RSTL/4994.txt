P. JOULE ON THE AIR-ENGINE, 71

employed to evaporate water in the boiler is afterwards evolyed in the form of work,
in consequence of the liquefaction, in the cylinder, of a portion of the expanding
vapour. This fact would induce the hope that a great portion of the latent heat of
evaporation, which is at present almost entirely Jost, might by an increase of tempe-
rature, and by extending the principle of expansion, be converted into mechanical
effect. If, as would appear from the experiments of Ds La Rive and Marcer, Havcrarm
and DvuLoxs, the capacity for heat of a given volume is the same in all gases taken
at the same pressure and temperature, the results of the above Tables will be equally
true whatever elastic fluid be employed. It now only remains to offer a few observations, with a view to facilitate the labours
of those who may be desirous of constructing a good practical air-engine.
