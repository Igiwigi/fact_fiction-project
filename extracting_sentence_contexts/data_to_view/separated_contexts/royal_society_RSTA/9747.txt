This follows immediately from the fact that, since

we have

§12. We have so far confined ourselves to the consideration of functions of positive
type, but the reader will easily perceive that the results obtained for these functions
may be made applicable to those of negative type by a simple device. In fact, if
«(s, t) is of negative type in the square Q, and we suppose that

kK (s, t) = —K (s, t),

it is evident that «’ (s, ¢) is of positive type in Q. Applying then what we have said
about functions of positive type to «’(s, t), we may deduce the analogous properties of
x (s, t); for instance, the necessary and sufficient condition that a continuous symmetric
function «(s,t) defined in the square aSssb, aStSb may be of negative type is
that the functions

should never be negative when the variables s, 82, ..., Sy... each range over the closed
interval (a, b). We may remark that this result and that of § 10 prove the classes of functions of

positive and negative types to be mutually exclusive, save for the trivial case when
«(s, t) vanishes everywhere.
