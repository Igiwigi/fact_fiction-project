PART I.

AMONG the many discussions to which the subject of madder has given rise among
chemists, there is none which is calculated to excite 80 much interest as that concern-
ing the state in which the colouring matter originally exists in this root, and there is
no part of this extensive subject which is at the same time involved in such obscurity. It is a well-known fact that the madder root is not well adapted for the purposes of
dyeing until it has attained a growth of from eighteen months to three years, and
that after being gathered and dried it gradually improves for seyeral years, after
which it again deteriorates. During the time when left to itself, especially if in a
state of powder, it increases in weight and bulk, in consequence probably of absorp-
tion of moisture from the air, and some chemical change is effected, which, though
not attended by any striking phenomena, is sufficiently well indicated by its results. There are few chemical investigations that bave thrown any light on the nature of
the process which takes place during this lapse of time, and in fact most of the at-
tempts to do s0 have merely consisted of arguments based on analogy.
