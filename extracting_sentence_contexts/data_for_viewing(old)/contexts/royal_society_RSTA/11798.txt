of parts to g.

Moreover (as in the bipartite), we may suppose the numbers p, q, to be inter-
changed. This would simply amount to rotating the reticulation through a right
angle.

The line of route partitions the reticulation into two parts, each of which may be
regarded as a partition of a unipartite. In fact, a line of route graphically
represents a pair of partitions.

These partitions can be equally depicted by the essential nodes only that occur
along the line of route. It will be more convenient, for some purposes, to take the
line of route, and not merely the essential nodes, to be the graphical representation.
Attention for the present will be limited to the partition lying to the North-West of
the line of route (7.e., towards the point J). A line of route involves bends _ |, termed
“eft-bends,” and bends [~, termed “ right-bends.” Essential nodes occur at the
angular points of the latter. The North-West partition has as many different parts
as there are left-bends on the line of route. The number of lines of route which have
s left-bends is equal to the number which have s right-bends. This may be seen by
rotating the reticulation through two right angles.
