Similarly, iff we substitute the values of v, from (57) and of z, from (63) in E[s,] v,
and in &(r;)z,, the coefficients of e«, in the resulting expressions are equal, Hence

(61) and (65) are identical equations in the e’s. (iv.) The values of the e's as given by these equations are in fact independent of
the w’s or the y’s. For the value of A, as found in (iii.) above is
