THERMO-ELASTIC PROPERTIES OF MUSCLE. 171

(6) Tue Corrrictent or THERMAL EXPANSION oF Muscie. It is interesting to calculate the value of «, the coefficient of thermal expansion,

from the formula
i ie wea! aT (P;—P,) (+0)
ag > ep sp ria (mass) (specific heat) (mechanical equivalent)’

On the right side of the formula we can measure everything directly except a,
while our records enable us to determine the rise of temperature. As a matter of fact,
it is necessary, in the records, to separate the reversible thermodynamic production of
heat from the irreversible “ viscous” one. We have not succeeded in doing this by
any rigidly accurate method, but a more or less approximate value can be estimated
from the records. The result comes out that @ is negative (7.e., the muscle shortens
on warming) and in size between 107° and 107%.
