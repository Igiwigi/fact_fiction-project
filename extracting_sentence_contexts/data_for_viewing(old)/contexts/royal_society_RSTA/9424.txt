spacing the intensities of the various orders fall off as the inverse square, in the second

that the intensity of any spectrum is proportional to 1/sin’#, where @ is the glancing
angle, no matter whether the spectra belong to one or to several spacings of the planes.
This involves both the facts just stated.

We chose such a form of the density curve for the single atom that we could
account for the first fact. The important point is that without further hypothesis
we explain the second. -The formula we have obtained shows that when a*c* is small
compared to n*x* the intensity varies inversely as n? when a@ is constant, and as a’? when
n is constant. ,

Thus our hypothesis is self consistent. It does not seem unreasonable. If it turns
out to be true, though there is much to be done before its truth can be considered
proved, it seems to offer an excellent means of determining the distribution of
electrons in the atom.

One or two subsidiary points may be considered very briefly.

I have considered the case of a crystal in which the atoms are all alike and the
