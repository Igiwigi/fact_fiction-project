mass, which is inversely proportional to the second derivative of energy versus momentum, is
vastly different for electrons moving in the z-direction as compared with the electrons moving
in the x or y directions. Ignoring collisions, we calculated the effective conductivity of such
a semiconductor superlattice at room temperature, which is an imaginary quantity since the
collision is ignored, as a function of frequency, and we compared it with the corresponding
quantity for one of the building blocks, i.e. Hg9¢;Cdo3sTe. We note significant enhancement
(about 3 orders of magnitude) in the conductivity of electrons in the z-direction in this superlattice.
Importantly, at room temperature the electron transport, and thereby the conductivity, is
determined by a wide range of electronic states with energies separated by a value of the order
of kgT. Thus, the fact that conductivity enhancement is large demonstrates that the metamaterial
effect is ‘broadband’ on the scale of the energy fluctuations determined by the thermal agitation,
and hence is not due to a resonant effect. In subsequent works, we have further demonstrated that
the paradigm of transformation optics may allow bulk materials to be designed with an isotropic
zero mass and a giant nonlinear response [32], and to have a ‘perfect lens’ for electron waves [33].
Furthermore, the proposed ideas, in particular the extreme anisotropy regime, can be extended
to graphene electronics [34,35]. Our theoretical study of tailoring the effective mass of electrons


shows that the transformation electronics can indeed provide an exciting route to tailor the
electronic transport in semiconductors and graphene and in general in ‘electronic metamaterials’.
