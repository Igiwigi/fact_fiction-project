When, therefore, we begin to reduce these results 80
as to obtain the ratio of the quantities of electricity supposed to be distributed on the
charged cylinder, we should expect to find them more or less disturbed by the variable
inductive action between the repelling bodies. We accordingly perceive, on referring
to Table X., that the ratio of the centre c to the extremity & is at first, with plates «a
and b, as 1:2, or nearly 80; being a similar result to that obtained by CouLonse *. Under plate c this ratio tends to change, as more clearly shown in Table VIII. : in
fact, it is at this point the law for the plate c, touched at the extremity, begins to

vary, as seen in the same Table. When, however, the two columns c and « again vary
together, or nearly s0, the ratio of the quantities, as given by each of the discs, is
about the same as before, until at last, where the induction upon the tangent plate
is the most perfect, the ratio becomes one of equality, or nearly 80.
