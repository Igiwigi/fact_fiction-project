stages when it first begins to walk, and after the animal no longer rg
ever it falls it is to the same side as the lesion. This is very noticeable jp
to walk upstars, when the paresis is rendered very evident. As fur
of this paresis on the side of the lesion, may be instanced the fact that
cases when the animal first commences to attempt to walk it always tri
the side of the cerebellar lesion against the wall of the room, or some ot
of support, whereas, as will presently be seen, they lie with the opp
supported at first in order to prevent the movements of rotation wh
otherwise occur.
Before leaving this part of the subject it may be well to refer to the
known as ‘‘ Circus movements,” in which the animal walks round and round
trunk curved, the concavity being towards the central axis round which it is:
and its head and tail being thus approximated. This was exceedingly rarely
as an effect of lesions of the cerebellum, whereas it was a constant feature
of the labyrinth. When it occurred in dogs with cerebellar lesions, it was al
those instances in which only a slight lesion had been effected, such as remo
