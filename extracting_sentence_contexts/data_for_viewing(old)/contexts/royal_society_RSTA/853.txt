energy economist Dieter Helm suggests more generally: ‘the conventional fossil fuels are
gradually being forced out of their main markets .. . . Itis in electricity that the major technological
progress is being made ....It is now possible to at least imagine a world in which ... almost
everything was electric, and most electricity was solar ....The fossil fuel industries are doomed
in the long run. There is not much of a long-term future in this business’ [33].

Plainly, too many complexities and complications are involved for a thorough discussion of the
energy transition in the space available here. To the extent that it is becoming cheaper to pursue
more ambitious mitigation by substituting renewables, the mitigation gambles become pointless
as well as morally unjustified. It seems safe to conclude, at least, that our previous worries about
facing a tragic dilemma between controlling climate and reducing poverty are increasingly being
undercut by technological developments with their own powerful momentum. A commitment to
poverty alleviation is no reason for less ambitious mitigation—in fact, quite the contrary—but a
reason for just international burden-sharing.
