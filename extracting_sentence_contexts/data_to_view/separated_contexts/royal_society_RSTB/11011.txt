Furthermore, targeting the stress-inducible, but not the basal, chaperoning capacity. HSF1 is being considered for use in combinatorial therapies Owing to the chronic proteotoxic stress endured by malignant
to mitigate the counterproductive HSF1 activation triggered cells, HSF1 is obligated to remain constitutively active to
by proteasome and HSP90 inhibitors [61]. In fact, in recent supply the additional chaperoning capacity, which is necessary
years increasing efforts have been invested in developing to accomplish and sustain malignant transformation. Thus, the
various strategies to target HSF1 for cancer therapies. proteostasis in cancer is constrained and fragile, distinct from

that in primary non-transformed cells, which is robust and
capable of buffering a considerable degree of proteomic
perturbation. This key distinction may offer a promising
opportunity for proteostasis-targeted anti-cancer therapies.

(a) Targeting HSF7 mRNAs
One means to block the HSF1 pathway is to deplete HSF1
mRNAs via RNAi.
