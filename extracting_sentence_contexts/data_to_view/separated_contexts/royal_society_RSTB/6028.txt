(ADELMANN, 1926.) ADELMANN’S analysis of the growth processes in the prootic region clearly shows that
expansion plays a crucial part in determining the development of the eye-muscle
rudiments and especially of the anterior head-cavity. It is perfectly true that the
facts of eye-muscle development in birds do not immediately suggest the somitic
nature of the rudiments, but it is equally true that in comparative studies the only
sound method of interpretation is to proceed from the lower and simpler forms to
the higher and more complex. Now, it is well known that in the lower vertebrates
the eye-muscle rudiments approach much more closely to the conditions of somites ;
in Cyclostomes, in fact, the metotic somites form a continuous series with the three
prootic somites (Koxtrzorr, 1901; and see also Bracuet, 1921, p. 362). It would
therefore seem that the burden of proof must rest on those who would deny the somitic
nature of the eye-muscle rudiments in the higher forms—a burden which appears never
to have been adequately sustained.
