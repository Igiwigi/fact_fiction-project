remained normal) be nil but for the lowered CO, threshold ; and at such a pressure, in
an acclimatised person, the lowered alveolar threshold for CO, would be necessary in
order to give the lung epithelium the opportunity of raising the arterial oxygen
pressure sufficiently to support life.

It is more difficult to estimate the physiological value of the increased hemoglobin
percentage at high altitudes. .We have seen above that the hemoglobin of arterial
blood as it leaves the lungs is 95 per cent. saturated as compared with 96 per cent.
saturated at sea-level. The difference is quite inappreciable ; and if we were only to
take this difference into account we should be compelled to conclude that the increased
hemoglobin percentage at high altitudes is of no use whatsoever and only a blind
response to a want which it does not meet under the particular circumstances of a
low barometric pressure. We were, in fact, inclined at first to take this view. An
increased hzemoglobin percentage would clearly tend to compensate for a diminished
circulation rate, as in heart disease, or for a diminished oxygen-carrying power of the
blood, as in anzemia or chronic carbon monoxide poisoning; but it is not at all so
clear that it would help in a case where the defect lies, not in the oxygen-carrying
power or rate of circulation of the blood, but in the aeration of the blood in the lungs.
The more heemoglobin there was in the blood the lower would its percentage satura-
tion tend to become, and the lower, also, would the arterial oxygen pressure tend to
become.

On further consideration, however, we believe that this reasoning is incorrect.
Reasons have already been given for concluding that at low barometric pressures
easily oxidisable metabolites pass through the lungs into the arterial blood in
