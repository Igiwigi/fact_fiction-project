a strong O-H bond, stronger than O2-H in fact, indicating that it is likely that hydrogen would
only adsorb readily at the O2 sites once the nearest O1 sites are saturated.

(c) Hydrogen adsorption at surface defects

Work on the defect-free olivine surfaces was complemented by the investigation of hydrogen
adsorption as a possible compensation method for the presence of metal cation vacancies. In
each case, the metal atom (Mg or Fe) was removed and hydrogens placed on each of the two
O1 sites adjacent to the vacancy. Geometry optimization was then carried out to obtain realistic
O-H bonding geometries.
