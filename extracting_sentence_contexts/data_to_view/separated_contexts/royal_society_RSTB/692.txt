The same author regarded them as gum-canals, and was of opinion that they passed
through the entire cortex—an opinion which Count Sorts is unable to accept on such
evidence as M. Renautr had then furnished (‘Fossil Botany,’ English translation,
p- 258). My specimens, now described, certainly support the Count Sorms’ conclu-
sions on each of these points. So far from the parichnoid organs supplying any
evidence of generic, much less of class, differences between Sigillaria and Lepidoden-
dron, the fact that the two genera alike possess these very remarkable and unique
structures affords a strong additional proof of their close relationship. In fig. 87
