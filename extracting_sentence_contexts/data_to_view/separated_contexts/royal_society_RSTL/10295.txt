T. MASTERS,

Whilst on plot 5, with ammonia-salts, the number of species found in the gamples
declined in the first three separation-years from 38 to 36 and 31, on plot 15, with the
nitrate of soda, ib was 39 in each of the three years ; and whilst it declined to 29 in the
fourth separation-year with ammonia-salts, ib rose to 43 on plot 15 after the mixed
mineral manure had been substituted for the nitrate. The table shows that there was much less fluctuation, and a lower mean percentage
of gramineous herbage, on plot 15 than on plot 5; the highest amount was little over
80 per cent., the fact being that a much larger number of miscellaneous species
contributed their share to the yield. A glance at the figures more in detail brings to view the fact that no one grass
contributed snch an overwhelming percentage as on plot 5, and that a much larger
number yielded a fair proportion. Here again, however, Festuca ovina furnished in
the third separation-year rather more than one-third of the whole; but in neither
year did Agrostis vulgaris contribute an excessive proportion as it did on plot 5.
