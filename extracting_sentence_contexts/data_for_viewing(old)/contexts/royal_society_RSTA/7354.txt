Let us assume v’, w’ small, and the rotation of the machine to be small, so that p’, q’, 7”
are all of zero order. This means that if we use # as independent variable, with the
equations of motion (18-9) then q’ is of zero order, and the corresponding P, Q, R of
(18-5) are never large; if we use ¢ in (18-13), then ’ is of zero order, and P, Q, R of
(18-11) are never large; and if we use y in (18-17), then 7’ is of zero order and P,Q, R
of (18-15) are never large. We shall take s’ to be of the second order.

turn. Let us use @ as independent variable in equations of motion (18-9).

The fifth equation gives at once that w’ is of the second order. Noting that x,, /,; %,
are usually negligible; and taking into account the fact that usually, for normal con-
dition, x,,/kps Yolk are of zero order, while z,,/kp, Z,/ky are of order —1; then since v’
is small, while w’ is of the second order, we at once deduce that the first three equations

of (18-9) give
