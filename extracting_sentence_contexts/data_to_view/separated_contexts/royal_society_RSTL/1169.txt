have been dependent merely upon its place in the magnetic
meridian, or upon an accidental curyature of it; but M. Rouacnzs, of Trente, is
sfated to have discovered that the pile of Volta caused a declination of the needle; the
details are not given, but if the general statement be correct, the author could not
haye observed the same fact as M. OxrsTeD, but merely supposed that the needle
had its magnetic poles altered after being placed in the voltaic circuit as a part of the
electrical combination. 8 Sir Humenry Davy on

obscure, or their experiments inaccurate, they were neglected:
the chemical and electrical phenomena exhibited by the won-
derful combination of Volta, at that time almost entirely
absorbed the attention of scientific men ; and the discovery
of the fact of the true connection between electricity and
magnetism, seems to have been reserved for M. OxrsrTeD,
and for the present year. This discovery, from its importance and unexpected nature,
cannot fail to awaken a strong interest in the scientific world -
and it opens a new field of enquiry, into which many experi-
menters will undoubtedly enter : and where there are $0
many objects of research obvious, it is scarcely possible that
Similar facts should not be observed by different persons. The progress of science is, however, always promoted by a
speedy publication of experiments; hence, though it is pro-
bable that the phenomena which I have observed may have
been discovered before, or at the same time in other parts
of Europe, yet I shall not hesitate to communicate them to
you, and through you to the Royal Society. I found, in repeating the experiments of M. OrrsTeD
with a voltaic apparatus of one hundred ' pair of plates of
four inches, that the south pole of a common magnetic
needle.
