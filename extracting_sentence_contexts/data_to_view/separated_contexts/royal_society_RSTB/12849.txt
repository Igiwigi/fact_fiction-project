However, the results
have been mixed (see [280]), which might reflect variability
across studies in the tasks, the use of relatively small
sample sizes and biased selection of participants (particu-
larly when older volunteers are more healthy than
average). The recent study by West et al. [280] addressed
these problems by using a large, population-derived cohort
called Cam-CAN, in which a simple sensorimotor task was
optimized for detection of HRF shape [281]. This study
found extensive effects of age on the HRE, particularly its
latency, in many brain regions, despite the fact that there
were no performance differences between young and old
adults (although latencies of neuronal responses were not
directly measured).

(ii) Dynamic causal modelling

Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) is a model-based approach
to studying brain connectivity [282], which includes a bio-
physical model of the BOLD response [267,268]. DCM uses
a Bayesian framework to simultaneously estimate parameters
capturing neural activity (and connectivity) and parameters
capturing the vascular mapping of that activity to the
BOLD response. The neural activity can either be defined
by experimental manipulations [282] or by assumptions
about the endogenous fluctuations that occur in task-free
states like rest [283].
