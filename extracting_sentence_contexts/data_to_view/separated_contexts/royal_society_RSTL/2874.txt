I mention theſe circumſtances more willingly,
fince it has been generally imagined, that the northern
parts of Italy contained few, if any, ſuch productions,
They are, however, not only full as common, but, if I
Smiſtake not, more inſtructive than thoſe of any other
Zprovince of that country. For, beſides the phznome=
=non of Monte Roflo, on the importance of which I have
already inſiſted, and the other curious vulcanic produc-
Hions of the Euganean hills, I muſt obſerve, that, from
.2he inordinate courſe of the Appenines in general, the
Syulcanic hills of that chain afford no obſervation ſo in-
Aereſting to phyſical geography and the theory of ſuch
phenomena, as that before remarked of the correſpon-
Alent direction and paralleliſm of the vulcanic and other
Franches of the Veroneſe and Vicentine diſtricts. My
Sbſervations alſo, on the vulcanic branches of theſe diſ-
aricts, do not ſeem to agree with the celebrated Monſ,
*BVETTARD's principle, who ſuppoſes, that all vulcanic
Inaterials obſervable in calcareous countries are adventi-
ious; the contrary of this being indeed demonſtrated
Fy the facts I have advanced. Nor have I entered parti-
cularly into an account of my vulcanic tour in the Vene-
tian ſtate, that I might not abuſe myſelf of the ſufferance
of ſo. reſpeCtable a Society by an unintereſting detail of

facts, however juſtifiable I might have been, by the ime
portance of ſome of them. For another imperfect bafal-
tine columnar group, of which I have alſo a drawing,
exiſts near Gambellara, in the Veroneſe territory, a few
miles from Montebello; and, according to the informa-
tions I have received, they are equally prevalent in the
adjacent diſtrict of Vicenza.
