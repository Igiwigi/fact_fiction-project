Figure 2a shows the
normalized concentration fields of the product B particles (cg /co) plotted in the xz plane. Although
there is overall qualitative agreement between the continuum and simulated concentration fields,
the continuum model systematically underestimates the simulated values. This discrepancy could
be due to the fact that the simulations are carried out at small but finite Péclet number, whereas
the Péclet number in continuum model is assumed to be zero; however, simulations of a reactive
Janus particle without propulsion (R4 = Rg) also show a similar discrepancy. Thus, the results
point to a breakdown of the continuum model on small length scales near the surface of the
particle where the catalytic reaction occurs. The continuum model accounts for reactions through
a boundary condition on the outer edge of the boundary layer and further assumes the fluid
flow field satisfies stick boundary conditions on the surface of the particle.
