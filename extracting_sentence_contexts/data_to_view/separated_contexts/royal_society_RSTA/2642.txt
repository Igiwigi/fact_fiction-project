Based on this survey, the altitude difference between the detector and the base
of the Gran Cava was found to be (21 + 2) m (the large uncertainty takes into account the uneven
ground inside the Gran Cava). This value is slightly larger than the value found with the back-
projection method. This result requires careful verification and could be linked to the fact that we
do not know the exact structure of the material contained between the position of the detector and
the Gran Cava. In fact, we have already identified some tunnels near the detectorâ€™s location that
cannot be easily accessed due to the collapse of material from above. The observed effect could
then be due to some cavities still present below the Gran Cava floor.
