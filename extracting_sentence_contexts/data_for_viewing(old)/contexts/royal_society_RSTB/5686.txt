gonads themselves. That convergent or parallel evolution has probably occurred is
admitted, but the extent which is implied if anural development is assumed to be
monophyletic, until much more positive evidence is produced, is too enormous to be
considered,

It is therefore concluded that the less unreasonable. of these alternatives is that
anural development has been evolved on several, if not many, occasions within the
family Molgulide, in spite of the fact that among the ascidians it seems to be confined
to that family.

5(f). DepenpENcE or DEVELOPMENT oF SENSE ORGANS UPON DEVELOPMENT OF TAIL.

It has been seen that in the development of Molgula there is a correlation between
the formation of a larval sense organ, otolith alone in this case, and the presence of a
tail. In no case is the one known to be present without the other.* This can mean
one of two things. Hither the formation of an otolith is directly dependent upon the
development of a tail, i.e, the tail or some region or activity thereof acts as a
“ organiser,” or else in every case where the tailed larva has been suppressed the otolith
has disappeared through disuse.
