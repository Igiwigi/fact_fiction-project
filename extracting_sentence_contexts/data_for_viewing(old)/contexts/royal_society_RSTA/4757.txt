wave must somehow make a detour around the object to be hidden, yet we request the same .
propagation time as without the object, so the velocity must be larger. For electromagnetic
waves in vacuum or air as surrounding, this simple fact imposes serious restrictions: the local
phase velocity of light can exceed the vacuum speed of light at a given frequency (refractive
index n(w) < 1). However, if we aim for broadband operation, e.g. for the entire visible spectral
range, dispersion must be negligible and the group and the energy velocity would be equal to
the phase velocity. According to the theory of relativity, mass and energy are equivalent and
cannot propagate faster than the vacuum speed of light. Thus, free-space macroscopic (many
wavelengths in size) omnidirectional broadband cloaking for light waves is not compatible with
the laws of physics, i.e. it is ‘impossible’. Unfortunately, such an ideal cloak is what is expected
when reading about invisibility cloaking in the media.

Even for monochromatic operation, causality (the fact that we cannot change the past) imposes
serious constraints for passive materials. To bring the phase velocity above the vacuum speed of
light (< Re(1) < 1), one needs resonances. Even far away from the resonance, the real part of the
refractive index is accompanied by a finite imaginary part, ie. by losses. For macroscopic objects
to be cloaked, these losses limit the size s below which the set-up remains reasonably transparent
[21]. Starting from a plane wave in one dimension according to

E(x,t) = Ep exp(i (kx — wt)) = Ep exp (i (F tree + ilm(n)]x — =) (2.1)

and, for example, demanding less than 10% loss in the field amplitude (20% loss in intensity), one
immediately arrives at the instructive rough estimate
