mixed with g8 volumes of olefiant gas of specific gravity
.970, should give a mixture of the specific gravity .754; instead
of .go06, which was the actual specific gravity of the entire
oil gas. It will be found on calculation that the g8 volumes
of gas, in order to make up the real specific gravity of the
oil gas, must have had the specific gravity of 1.4, very nearly:
This is the highest number that is deducible from my experi-
ments for the specific gravity of that portion of oil gas or coal
gas, which is condensed. by the. action, of chlorine. In,other
instances, it varied from. that number down-to-1:2, but- in
every case its weight surpassed that of common air.

It is evident from these facts that the a&riform ingredient
of oil gas and coal gas, which is reducible to a liquid form-by
chlorine, is not identical with the olefiant-gas-obtained by the
action of. sulphuric acid on alcohol, but considerably exceeds
that, gas/in specific gravity and combustibility. Two. views
may be taken of its nature ; for it may; either be/a-gas 4
