1. Introduction

Light pollution has become a global concern, a fact substantiated by a recent reso-
lution of the American Medical Association (AMA) 2 years ago asserting that light
at night is a source of environmental pollution because it disrupts daily rhythms
and suppresses nocturnal melatonin production by the pineal gland [1]. Artificial
light at night (ALAN) exposures have been reported to be associated with serious
ecological consequences and health risks including cancer [2-4]. Recently, the
impact of light pollution as a new environmental risk factor and its relation to
human breast and prostate cancers was discussed [5]. Breast cancer incidence
has been increasing worldwide for the past few decades, being higher in developed
countries than in undeveloped countries, suggesting that changes in lifestyle could
account for the increase in breast cancer rates [6]. While much attention has been
given to spatial variables in regard to lifestyle, less attention has been given to
the impact of temporal variables on disruption of our biological clock, which is
