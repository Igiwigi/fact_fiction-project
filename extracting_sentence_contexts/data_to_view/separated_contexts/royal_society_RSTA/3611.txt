and we may therefore expect to be able to use it to extend our former process of
“summing” asymptotic series. § 37. We may, in fact, show at once that we can sum any series of convergency

zero f(z) =a) +az+..-+az2"-+..., in which Lt a, = (n!)', where & is any

finite quantity. For this purpose we put ¢ = p, =...=p,=1;
