The magnetic particles embedded in the hydrogels prepared in this work were composites
of bentonite platelets on which magnetite nanoparticles were synthetized by a coprecipitation
reaction. These composite particles were functionalized by adsorption of alginate molecules and
the resulting particles had low density and, consequently, negligible settling rate inside the pregel
solution. This fact allowed homogeneous ferrogels with a high enough MRE to be obtained. Nevertheless, the intensity of that MR effect strongly depended on the concentration of sodium
alginate employed for the preparation of the pregel solution, being the optimal concentration
0.5% w/v. The comparison of the ferrogels based on magnetic particles with different shapes and the
same alginate concentration—normalizing other quantities as particle concentration, applied field
and magnetization—demonstrated that the more intense MR effect was achieved with fibre-like
particles.
