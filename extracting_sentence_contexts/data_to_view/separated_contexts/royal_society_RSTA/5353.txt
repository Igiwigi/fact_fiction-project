If this makes your current
hard problem seem easy, it might correspondingly make the next very hard problem manageable. Keeping things simple applies, in the first instance, to choosing a good notation, where | will
again quote from McIntyre [31, p. 200]:

... bad mathematical notation where four things of the same kind are written as a, M3, £0,
TT{', instead of a, b,c, d,... I was, in fact, pulled up on something a little like this early in my career on the second page of
Rodney Hill’s aforementioned letter (figure 4), where he commented that my compact notation
‘will give the printers (also) a headache’. Finally, I must mention a style of showing off and sheer obfuscation that was prevalent
when engineers started to learn about chaos theory, which involved reading some advanced
mathematical books where definitions were quite important. A research student, imitating such
books, would say (in obscure mathematical notation) that the time, t, is an element of the
real numbers lying between minus infinity and plus infinity.
