If these figures are compared with those obtained by the standard method, and repre-
sented in fig. 12, it will be seen that the degree of discrimination is only slightly reduced. This fact has to be allowed for in all the preceding experiments. (d) General discussion of restraint

Ullyett (1936) has maintained that the application to field conditions of results
involving the exercise of restraint by a parasite demands considerable caution. This
worker finds it difficult to believe that after an exhaustive search for hosts which
may be widely distributed over many host plants, a female parasite will leave a host
without ovipositing because it happens to be parasitized.
