The influence of Péclet number P = wL/D on the particle-size distribution function is
illustrated in figure 3. As is easily seen, the number of smaller particles decreases and the number
of larger particles increases with increasing Péclet number (figure 3a). This is due to the fact that
larger particles are transported faster by the fluid flow, and smaller particles dissolve faster with
increasing Péclet number. What is more, an increase in the Péclet number symmetrically shifts the
distribution function to the right, towards larger values of the channel coordinate y (figure 3b). Figure 4 demonstrates the influence of various source cross-sections yo (where particles come
into the channel) on the distribution function.
