THE OVUM IN THE AMPHIBIA. 225

which this was employed, could be relied on, it was necessary to confirm the facts
ascertained by chemical investigation, by observing the mode of action of solutions of
caustic potass, and other chemical agents on the spermatozoa, by means of the micro-
scope. As my observations on the effect of chemical agents on the spermatozoa have
been confined for the present to those of the Frog, I shall state the results of these
observations with the microscope before mentioning the experiments.

All the observations were made immediately after the spermatozoa employed had
been obtained, by the course already mentioned, and not by vivisection from the
vesicule seminales or the testes, sources which are objectionable from the facts shown
in Dr. Frericns' analyses, that a large quantity of albumen is always found in the
immature cells in the testes, with which the spermatozoa, obtained from that source,
are constantly mixed, while there is no trace of albumen in the mature spermatozoa.

1. Solution of Caustic Potassâ€”The solution employed was in the proportion of
twenty grains of caustic potass (Potassa fusa) to one ounce of water. This was the
solution employed on most occasions in the following experiments, and which quickly
and entirely dissolves the spermatozoa. When a drop of semen, in which the sper-
matozoa are active and abundant, covered by a pellicle of talc on a plate of glass, is
attentively examined, while a very small quantity of the potass solution is applied to
the edge of the talc, the act of dissolution is easily witnessed. As the solution spreads
beneath the talc the spermatozoa first brought into contact with it are instantly de-
