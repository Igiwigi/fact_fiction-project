IV, 45- 58. 63 and 69 the $tars are perfectly central, which
proves that the chevelure is connected with them. In:IV., 36.
71 and 74 the nebulosity is likewise attached tothe stars, but
their nebulosity is more irregularly and extensively expanded,

What has been said of the gradual condensation, of the ne-
bulous matter in the case of extended nebulz, is supported by
a much greater number of nebulosities of a spherical form.
The different gradations of their condensation are pointed out
in the same paper from page go1 to go8; and contain g22
cages in which the fact of the gradual condensation is rendered
S0 evident as not to admit of a doubt. Then, if instead of the
