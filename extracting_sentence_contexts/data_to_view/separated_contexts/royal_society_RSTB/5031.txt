DUCTLESS GLANDS AND LYMPHATIC SYSTEM OF ANGLER FISH. 19

hep.v.). There can, I think, be no question that these veins, in spite of the fact
that some of their tributaries are derived from parts normally served by the inferior
jugulars, are, in fact, ventro-clavicular veins, with an extended area of drainage, and
that the great branchless vessel that connects the efferent lymphatic channel of the
thyroid with the duct of Cuvier is the inferior jugular stripped of its normal factors
and specialised to act solely as an efferent vessel of the thyroid lymph sinus. (d) Discussion From the above description it is evident that the relation of the
superficial ventral and branchial lymphatics to the thyroid body in Lophius is very
peculiar, and though I have been unable to find any parallel to it in any published
description of these parts in other fishes, it will be of interest to examine how far it
can be compared with the conditions more normally met with. My own observations in fishes, other than Lophius, are at present very imperfect.
