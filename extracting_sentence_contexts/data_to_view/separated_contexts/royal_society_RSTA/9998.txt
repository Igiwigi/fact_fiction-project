Then the
preceding work suggests that a solution may be found in which the first ¢ rows
proceed according to powers of ¢'", the next €, according to powers of ¢’, and so on. The whole would thus be of normal form with the variable ¢*, k being the least
common multiple of «, &.... Tn fact, if we change the independent variable to ¢', k having this value, the matrix
Ay,-.+1 is identically zero, and the indices 6',,...0%, are the roots of — (4,,)"+0 = 0. These roots are all equal, and the corresponding equations of condition are all
satisfied owing to the vanishing of the matrices other than A,,+1. If, now, we form the equation for 6',,-1 we have
