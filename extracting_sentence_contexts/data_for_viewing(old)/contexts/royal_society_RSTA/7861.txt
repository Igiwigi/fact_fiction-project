Apart from the chord w,, v,, there are no points of in the segment  (G,).
Now we consider the class St, = & (€,) of circles. We shall have

MC WV, y* (C') < S (©), for every C' < &,.

But &, contains arbitrarily large circles, and therefore S (€’) converges to the chord
u,, U,, for a sequence of circles ©’. _ Hence, for a suitable sequence of circles ©’ the
point y* (€’) converges to a point of the chord u,, v,, and this is obviously impossible,
since y does not lie on the chord. This proves the theorem.

The above proof does not show that there is exactly one circle y having the desired
property, but we shall see later that, in fact, there is only one.

Theorem 15—Under the assumptions and with the notations of Theorem 14, we have

Nm (9) = N*x (y) = Ng, (9).

Proof—By Theorem 14, we can represent » [Sp] as centre of gravity of positive
masses which are distributed over points of ©) x Y. Therefore, by Theorem 13,
we can choose a,, x,, with

x, <G xX M
and
