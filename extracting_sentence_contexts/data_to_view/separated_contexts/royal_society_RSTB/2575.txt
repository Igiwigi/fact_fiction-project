(4.) A great variety in the precise course and position of synapticular calcareous
bars gives the skeleton of Hupsammia at its peripheral portion a certain resemblance
with the involved meshes of coonenchyme in Madrepora and Turbinaria. Again, the
fact that many synapticule are directed obliquely inwards and upwards towards
the calyx shows the independence of the synapticula and its analogy with the growth-
pavt of a radial trabecula. The canalicular system of the Eupsammine, E.H., varies
we may say between the less complicated Fungia type and the more highly dif-
ferentiated “perforate” type, but it is the least constant of all features in the
Eupsamming, and the last that may serve as a systematic basis.

(5.) From the above microscopic study of skeletal features, the genus Hupsammia
will be seen to have much in common with the Fungidex.
