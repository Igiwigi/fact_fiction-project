If the animal be now restored
to normal sea-water, spontaneity will return in a feeble manner ; but there is always
afterwards a great tendency displayed by the bell to exhibit shivering spasms instead
of normal swimming movements in response to natural or ganglionic stimulation. And, as already observed, this peculiarity of the excitable tissues is also well marked
in the case of the artificial stimulation of deganglionated specimens under otherwise
gimilar ciremmnstances. The only facts which still remain to be considered regarding these shivering move-
ments of paralyzed Sars:a are those which have reference to electrical stimulation. It will be remembered that in my firs} paper (loc. cit.) I described these shivering
movements as ensuing, not only when the paralyzed bells are immersed in chemical
stimulants, but alsv when they are immersed in normal sea-water immediately after
having been submitted to electrical stimulation.
