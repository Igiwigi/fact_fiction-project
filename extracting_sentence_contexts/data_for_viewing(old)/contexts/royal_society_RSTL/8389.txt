life, got the upper hand, multiplied largely in specific and generic forms, and peopled the
earth with their successors, while Anoplotherium and Aiphodon died away without leaving
any*, In this inflexibility and rigidity of organization, in this inability to alter it as
completely as the competing genera were able to do, lay perhaps one of the causes of the
extinction of some genera and their replacement by others. All that I attempt here is
to show in what peculiarities of structure this rigidity of some genera and pliancy of
others consisted. I do not wish to put this as the only cause, but as one of the many
ï¬†till unknown causes which led to the extinction of s0 many animals that preceded the
present population of the earth.

I have adduced here only such cases as are known and described ; but having carefully
examined large collections of bones from the Eocene and Miocene deposits, T have been
struck with the recurrence of similar facts. Trying to reconstruct the extremities of 80me
Paridigitata of the Lower Eocene from Mauremont and Egerkingen, and of Miocene forms
from Rochette, I could distinctly perceive that all genera which have left no direct sncces-
sors, and which are entirely extinct, present the same rigidity and persistence of the
typical relations; on the contrary, those which have representatives in the living creation,
their direct successors, exhibit much more pliancy and much better adaptation to altered
circumstances of locomotion, along with the reduction in the number of digits.

Before proceeding to consider the two remaining groups of Paridigitata, the
Ruminantia and the Suina, we may draw the attention of the reader to the fact
that these two groups of Paridigitata are the only onesf which now people the
earth ; there is no greater diversity than this; and every living Paridigitate (if we
except the Hippopotamus) is always clearly a ruminant (including the Tragulide and
