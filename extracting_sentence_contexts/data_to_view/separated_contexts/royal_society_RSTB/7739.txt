What is particularly important about the 2005
Amazonian dieback was the speed and magnitude of

systems do not respond to stress such as high
temperatures or extreme weather events in a linear or
predictable manner. In fact, even small disturbances
can bring about large and sometimes irreversible
changes (e.g. dieback). The governance system that
tackled the 2005 crises was unconventional in its rapid
response and in the establishment of a situation room,
extensive networks and reliance on available infor-
mation on the internet. One may wonder whether such
a ‘flexible’ governance system can be institutionalized,
strengthened or replicated to cope with the future
