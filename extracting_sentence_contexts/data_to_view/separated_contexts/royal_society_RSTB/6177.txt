There it allows water drawn into the branchial chamber to circulate
slowly around the heart, intestine and gonads, and yet in the rare occurrence of the
loss of anterior tissues in this genus, the new formative cells arise from the epicardial
lining. There is therefore some suggestion of excretory function of the epicardium
in Ciona and definite evidence of an unspecialized condition of the cells forming it. In many ways, in fact, the ascidian epicardium as it appears in Ciona resembles the
coelom of the higher chordates. This question will be considered more fully
elsewhere. XIâ€”SuMMARY
