them ; nor in the eye itself, for they do not vanish when the star is made to
blink behind one of the thick wires of the eye-piece ; nor in scabrous polish of
the mirror, for they are not permanent. They come on 8uddenly ; seldom last
very long, and disappear as unexpectedly as they come. When first this phe-
nomenon presented itself, a considerable star which appeared 80 surrounded
was at once set down as a superb nebulous star, and it was not until another
and another entered the field similarly affected, that any doubt arose. As re-
gards the true cause of this phenomenon, that it is atmospheric I have no
doubt, and perhaps it must be looked for in some highly rarified material, dis-
seminated in cloud-like, though invisible, masses, in the very highest regions
of our atmosphere,—the same possibly which, when ignited by the passage of
electric currents, gives rise to many if not all the phenomena of the aurora
borealis. Be that as it may, the fact that an appearance, exactly resembling
that of a nebulous star, may originate in a non-luminous medium, interposed
between the eye and the star, serves to render it not improbable that snch
matter may exist, disseminated through the ether itself in determinate loca-
lities, and may render some stars which shine through it nebulous, which have
no real nebulous atmospheres about them. The frequency of nebulous stars
in the constellation of Orion seems to afford some support to this idea, though
I am far from contending that there are no stars really nebulous. Of such the
object immediately under consideration, indeed, must be regarded as an un-
doubted instance.

draw attention is the frequent and close proximity to these objects, of minnte
