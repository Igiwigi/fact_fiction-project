One such example may be telomere pos-
age-related deterioration in mitochondrial function and the ition effects on gene transcription. Genes positioned near the
possibility that oxidative damage imposes a selection for chromosome ends might be silenced by functional telomeres,

contribute to age-related changes in gene expression. Another

example relates to the fact that telomere sequences do not

the chromosomes.
