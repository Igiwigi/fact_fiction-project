That metals may exercise an-action'upon. each, other, even in

be easy to separate them ; and this will be more particularly
the case when'neither' of those substances is remarkable for
exercising a/ powerful action upon others. The method of
analysis therefore does '\not promise much 'success ; and the
labour of synthesis is sufficient to deter any individual from
the undertaking.
