In other words, a capacitor is a form of TL in
which a TEM wave moves with a single fixed velocity, which is the speed of light in the medium. Below we reproduce both the derivation of the TL-based capacitor discharge and the description

of the Wakefield experiment. : =

Those lectures triggered my deep interest in studying Oliver Heaviside’s work and, even more, : S
his whole life. And this very interest drew me to (then PhD student but now Dr) Christopher : 2
Donaghy-Spargo, with whom we founded NEMIG—northeast Electromagnetics Interest Group, : &
which since 2013 has enjoyed a formidable series of seminars given by scientists, engineers, : _
historians and entrepreneurs, driven by the ideas and lives of Maxwell, Heaviside and generally ane]
by the exciting field of electromagnetism. : 2

Coming back to the main object of this paper, which is the relationship between energy current : 3
and computing, I must admit that I had drawn most of inspiration from my familiarization with :s

Heaviside’s work, his legacy in the work of others, and to a great extent by the fact that both Ivor
Catt and David Walton came to studying electromagnetic theory from the point of view of energy
current through their experiences in dealing with high-speed digital electronics. This electronics
does not deal with sine waves. It deals with digital pulses, which are physical enough to be dealt
with in a ‘more physical way’ rather than expressing them as an algebraic sum of sine wave
harmonics stretching in the time domain from —oo to +00.
