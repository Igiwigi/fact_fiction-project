between these tubes is transparent, and contains no corpuscles.

* To obtain a distinct view of these canals, the epiphysis should be macerated in water for a short time, 80 as

to remove the perichondrium which invests it ; this was done to the specimen from which the drawing was

OF NON-VASCULAR ANIMAL TISSUES. 167

The articular cartilage, above described, is gradually being converted into bone
during the whole of life ; thus it is thicker in young than in adult subjects, and, as Sir
Bexaamin Bropis informs me, it is much thinner in old age than in the adult : in fact,
it is not very rare to find that the articular cartilage of the head of the os femoris in
very old persons has completely disappeared ; a change which is probably to be attri-
bated to its entire ossification®*,

Of the Nutrient Vessels of Articular Cartilage during its development, which are
Situated betwirt it and its Synovial Membrane.—Previous to giving a description of
the vessels which are present on the articular cartilage, and which are between it
and the synovial membrane investing it, I must here state that I believe that the
synovial membrane is extended over the surface of the articular cartilage. The valu-
able pathological researches of Sir B. Broprs have induced me to adopt this opinion ;
in addition to which, in favour of this view, the following accounts of dissections made
by HzxLe and myself may be cited.
