t&ations of the Filicineze have been completed. In the meanwhile it may be
fod that the main lines of investigation and of argument pursued in the above
Wvill be found applicable also to the Filicineze.
Bnot propose to discuss the results from a more general or from a phylogenetic
{f view till the close of the remaining part of this Memoir, which will have as
ject the morphology of the spore-bearing members of the Filicinez.
onclusion it may be remarked that there appears to be good reason, both from
ls of comparison and from detailed observation, to believe that one at least of
three possible modes of increase in number of spore-producing masses (separate
poria) suggested in the introductory paragraphs (p. 484), has played a part in
vyolution of Vascular Cryptogams, viz., subdivision and partitioning of an
mally simple sporogenous mass, by its partial sterilization and formation of septa.
not contended that the point has been actually demonstrated, but the facts
from the study of Z'mesipteris, when compared with those relating to other
ds, and Isoetes, make this conclusion appear a probable one. It may remail,
n question how important a part this factor may actually have taken in the
