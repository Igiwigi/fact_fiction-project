have postulated that certain findings, such as composite
tools, cave paintings and artefacts suggestive of symbolic
thought such as beads, were unlikely to have been produced
in the absence of language [93,105—108]. Even if such inference
is taken at face value, it provides, at best, a limit regarding the
time frame in which language may have emerged [107,108],
but does not tell us much about the context of its origin.

It has been argued that morphological changes in the
vocal apparatus or brain structures, whose existence may be
inferred from the skull’s shape, can serve as evidence regard-
ing language use [107]. We find this unlikely, in light of the
fact that language can be carried out fully over a gestural
modality as in sign language, and that multiple brain regions
are involved in language use while no brain region serves
language alone.”

However, a new discipline—experimental archaeology—is
rapidly bridging the gap between the archaeological record
and the neural and behavioural dynamics that it may reflect.
This approach involves the study of apes (human and non-
human) as they manipulate and produce tools and while
they teach and learn these skills [97,110]. Aided by neuroima-
ging technology, these studies explore the brain mechanisms
involved, and, coupled with studies of comparative neuroanat-
