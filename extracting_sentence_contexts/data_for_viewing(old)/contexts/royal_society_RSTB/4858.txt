The advantage of this indirect method of attack lies not only in the facts that for a
fine division of the year, the arithmetical difficulties of a direct attack are insurmountable,
and that no existing crop record is sufficiently long to justify the calculation from it of
50 or 60 independent regression coefficients, for the probable error of such determinations
depends on the excess of the number of observations over that of the coefficients evaluated
(9), but also in the increased accuracy attained through utilising our knowledge that the
regression function must in fact vary relatively slowly. This advantage is analogous to
that obtained by the author in collaboration with Miss Mackenzie, who found that using
the correlations of weekly rainfall between different stations in Great Britain from a
record of about 40 years, it is possible to estimate the correlation, for any one week
of the year, with an accuracy which, for any single week, would have required records
for over 1,000 years ; this was due to the fact that the sequence of correlations could be
well represented by a harmonic curve of only the second order, so that use could be made
of some 2,000 actual simultaneous observations of weekly rainfall to eliminate errors of
random sampling (8. Fisher and Mackenzin, 1922). In the present investigation the
accuracy is limited by the number of crops recorded, but the method employed enables
full use to be made of the meteorological data,

In the practical application of the method of the regression integral, it is not necessary
that the rainfall record should be strictly continuous ; indeed daily observations are
themselves too numerous to be conveniently handled. The rain was therefore divided
up into 61 periods of 6 days each, the integrations being replaced by summations over
61 terms. This introduces a slight modification into the form of the orthogonal functions
of the time, for it is necessary for exact work that
