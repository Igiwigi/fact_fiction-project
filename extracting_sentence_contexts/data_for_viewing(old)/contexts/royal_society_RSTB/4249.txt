in the development of the characteristic mammalian skull from that of a Therapsid
reptile.

The most interesting result of the present work is that it is now possible
satisfactorily to compare the monotreme skull with that of a Cynognathid, and that

362 MR. D. M. 8. WATSON ON THE MONOTREME SKULL:

such a comparison establishes the fact that many of the most remarkable and
unexpected features of the monotreme skull are merely extreme developments of
features already found in the latter group. Such a comparison shows how, by the
mere expansion of the brain, the auditory capsule, lying between it and the fixed
point formed by the articulation between the dentery and the squamosal which is
already predicted in Cynognathids, is as it were crushed, the long paroccipital process
of the opisthotic and prootic of Therapsids being reduced to the small paroccipital
process (ossified crista parotica), the incus which primitively lies outside it being
drawn within its outer end, a process the end stages of which may be followed in my
two Ornithorhynchus young.

The whole comparison shows that the monotremes are not to be regarded as
representatives of a separate stock distinct from that which gave rise to the Theria,
