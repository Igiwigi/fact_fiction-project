The separation 1070 is not so well
determined as the others and dy, may well be >‘01. Thus the first and third can
easily give the same values of «, but the second would require dy, of the order ‘03,
inadmissible if the », were accurately determined. But as a fact the average v, as we
have seen does not enter in the line here considered and it may be so large as to alter
the multiple. The second may therefore be considered as not at disposal, and the
third then gives very close limits, viz., with dy, +01

A, = 267°708—"0124é+'002
3 = 14°4708—"0007E+ 0001

the same value, though with closer limits of accuracy, as was obtained from the 265
separation, With maximum ¢ = ‘33, 6 = 144708 +0003,

But further, in addition to Watson’s separations, we have found affixed to the
F series, another =—1932, and this must be tested. The linked line is given by
B.M.M. as 6598°953 LA.
