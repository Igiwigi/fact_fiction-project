33. Such
lagging of chromosomes in anaphase is undoubtedly a hybrid phenomenon. â€˜The fact
that it is less marked in one of these hybrids than in the reciprocal is probably due
to the chromosome linkage, which occurs in the one and which is absent from the other. The linked chromosomes must pass to the equator of the spindle simultaneously, the

connections between them probably break away at approximately the same time
and the chromosomes of each group derived from the ring would pass together to the
pole. As will be seen later, linkage of chromosomes appears to result in much more
regular cytological behaviour than does complete pairing.
