BIONOMICS AND REPRODUCTIVE PROCESSES OF THE FORAMINIFERA. 263

protoplasm and the formation of eccentric and wild-growing supplemental chambers
was extraordinarily large! (fig. 58). I have here neither the time nor the space to go into the highly interesting
question of how the monothalamous calcareous Foraminifera of the group Lagena
increase the size of their shells. The study of. the life-history of this group is
rendered so difficult that it almost may be described as impossible by the fact that
there is no primordial chamber to be studied, or rather that the whole adult test is
itself an expanded primordial chamber. The youngest specimens found present no
difference of characteristics from the adult, but I think there can be no doubt that
the same power that enables the animal to secrete the carbonate of lime forming its
shell enables it at any given moment partially to redissolve it,-and to add newly
secreted material for the enlargement of the shell by a process of intussusception. The theory that the monothalamous Foraminifera periodically cast their shells and
build larger ones may be dismissed as fantastic,? but, as Lister has acutely
observed, “the student of the growth of bone will find no @ priori difficulty in
admitting that a rigid structure may be the seat of profound interstitial changes of
substance. ”*

A highly notable illustration of this quality is to be found in the rare and exquisite
species, Carterina spiculotesta (Carter), the shell of which is composed of blunted or
highly fusiform spicules of carbonate of lime, secreted by the animal itself, and felted
together on an extraordinarily co-ordinated plan, the spicules following the contour
of the chamberlets on the upper surface, whilst at the base of the test they turn
inwards so as to give the appearance that they radiate from the centre (fig. 59).
