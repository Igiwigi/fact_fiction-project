It is
extremely probable that the vertebra figured by Hasse as that of a Crossorhinus
from the Gault of Cambridge (15, D, Plate 25, fig. 10) is not an Orectolobid at all; it
is much more likely to be a Lamnid (¢f. Plate 27, figs. 26 and 37). The first method of inquiry mentioned above, that of the comparative study of the
vertebrae of adult fishes, was largely followed by Hasse, and the bulkiness of his mono-
graph is rather to be explained by this fact. In justice to him it may be pointed out
that until the vertebree of any particular fish are examined one cannot decide whether
they are of interest or not; when the examination has been made, the author is
performing a service to science by placing his observations on record, for even if the
structures prove to have no very direct bearing on the elucidation of the problem, he
spares his successors the labour of an independent examination of the vertebre. Negative results, though disappointing from the author’s point of view, are not
without their value as an addition to knowledge.
