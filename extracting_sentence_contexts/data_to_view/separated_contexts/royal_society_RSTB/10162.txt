This
so-called sideslip is reduced by the production of yaw torque,
but the temporal dynamics of this compensatory action are
different for saccades and escapes. During a saccade, yaw
torque is produced simultaneously with the bank and coun-
ter-bank, resulting in only a small amount of sideslip at the
end of the heading change. This is not the case for the evasive
manoeuvre; in fact, the fly typically produces negative yaw
torque during the initial phase of the manoeuvre, resulting in
an increase in sideslip. As a result, flies experience substantial
sideslip following an evasive banked turn and they continue
to generate positive yaw to correct the misalignment long after
the initial change in heading (figure 2c).
