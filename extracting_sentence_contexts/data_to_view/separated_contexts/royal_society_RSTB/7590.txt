Moreover, when holes were cut at some distance from the edge of the shell, the
margin of the mantle was similarly withdrawn before repair began. It is the great extent
to which the mantle can be withdrawn that makes this possible. What is also apparent
is the capacity of the extensive area within the mantle edge (and having similar histological
structure) to increase the thickness of the prismatic layer, a fact originally noted by
Jackson (1890). Thus newly formed marginal shell is no more than some 130, thick,
whereas it is at least ten times as thick in the regions where it becomes covered by the
inner shell layer. Whereas in a typical lamellibranch, e.g.
