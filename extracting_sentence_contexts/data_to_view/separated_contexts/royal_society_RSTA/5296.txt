Hence, by first-order differentiation with respect to A of both sides of equation (3.20), and by
using equation (3.8), the following fractional order partial differential equation is achieved:

By applying the right-hand side of equation (3.20), we obtain a fractional order partial

The solution of this equation (for H(0,4) = 0) is given as follows:

By applying the Laplace transform to equation (3.20), we obtain the following relation:

from which we can obtain the transfer function describing the dynamics between the heat flux

From this transfer function, the following relation describing the temperature at point 41 with

The power series is fast converging, thus the number of terms does not have to be too big. In fact, it can be reduced to just a few first terms. This reduction affects the accuracy of the
implementation but makes the implementation and analysis easier and faster. We consider two
examples of the approximation of the exponential transfer function.
