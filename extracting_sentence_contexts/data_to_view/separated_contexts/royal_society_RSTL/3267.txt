18.) becomes con-
verted into 3. There now occurs the deposit of another substance upon the inner
surface of the cylinder-wall,—that is [upon the inner surface of ] the cell-membrane
of the secondary muscle-cell, —whereby the wall becomes thickened and the cavity of
the cylinder reduced in size (compare the fibre y with 3). That the thickening of
the wall is not a thickening of the cell-membrane itself, as in cartilage, follows from
the fact that the cell-nuclei do not become pushed towards the cavity of the cylinder,
but remain lying at the outer part, in the situation they occupied before the secondary
deposit began. This is shown in 3. The secondary deposit continues until the cy-
linder is entirely filled.
