the sun's centre, and their angles of position and heights above his periphery could be
read off with a fair degree of accuracy.

In the three Plates, XIIT., XIV. and XV., a wrong correction was, however, applied
for the errors of the wires in determining the zero of the angular divisions, namely +29'
for both totality pictures, instead of +15'"5 for the first totality picture and +165
for the second; 80 that in taking angles of position of the prominences, the readings on
Plate XIIT. must be corrected by applying the number —T''5; those on Plate XIV. by
applying the correction —6'5, and those on Plate XV. by applying —7'0.

Morcover, a small error in determining the centre in Plate XTV. also interferes with
the absolute correctness of the position-angles and of the heights of the prominences
above the moon's periphery. Subsequently to this being etched, I discovered the fact
that the centre should have been placed about 5” of linear space nearer 2709, in a direction
from 90® to that point, and 4” nearer 360%. The angular positions of some of the prin-
cipal prominences, determined by measurement of the original negatives, will be herein-
after given, 80 that no difficulty will be experienced in correcting the position of the
other prominences as read off from the Plates. The prominences in these Plates are
represented in their natural (erect) position, and this is also the case with the sun-spots
in Plate XV. ; the position-angles are laid down from North towards East. The North
point (360*) is consequently at the top, the East point (90?) is on the left hand, the
South point (1809) is at the bottom, and the West point (270*) on the right hand.

In order to facilitate reference to the prominences, TI have designated them on
Plate XV. by capital letters, commencing with the prominence situated at right angles
