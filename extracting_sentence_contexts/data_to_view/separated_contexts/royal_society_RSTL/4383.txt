Of the relations between Magnetismn and the nervous force, the author thinks it
preferable to say nothing more at present, than that various indications appear to
him to be afforded, by recent investigations, of the existence of a direct and influential
connection Â®,

The relation thus pointed out between Nervous agency and the various Physical
forces, is the more remarkable, when it is considered that the nervous power must be
regarded as the highest of all the forms of vital force, both in its relations to mental
action, and in its dominant power over organic processes of every kind. Considering
how closely, as already pointed out, it is correlated to the forces concerned in mus-
cular and ciliary movement F, in nutrition and secretion, in development and repro-
duction, it cannot be thought improbable that what is true of it should be true of
them also; and that a relation of mutual conyertibility should exist between these
and one or more of the physical forces. Such relations the author believes to exist ;
and he now proceeds to adduce facts which appear to him adequate to support that
belief. The muscular force may be called forth, as is well known, by electricity directly
applied to the muscle itself; by heat, cold, and chemical agents; and by mechanical
irritation. These agencies, however, do not appear s0 directly concerned in the produc-
tion of the motor power, as in occasioning that metamorphosis of living organized tissne
into chemical compounds, whereon the development of the muscular force seems to be
immediately dependent.
