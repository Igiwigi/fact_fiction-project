cetes, on the one hand, and the Phycomycetes* (Mucor, Peronosporec and Suprolegnic)
on the other: the evolution of the latter group seems undoubtedly attended by a
fusion of parts before separated—a withdrawal of the sexual organs, 80 to peak, into
one another, —and Ds Bary has followed this out with marvellous skill and success
in a number of forms passing from Pythivm, through the Peronosporee, to certain
Saprolegnie, in which the male sexual organ (* antheridium,” © pollinodium,”) is
normally suppressed. Whether or not we s8uppose, with Dz Bay, that the Zrysiphec
took origin from 8ome Peronospora-like form, it seems reasonable to look upon Meliola
and its immediate allies as a branch group derived from the Frysiphe stem, either
from the ancestor of Frysiphe itself or from ancestors which gave rise to Furotium and
Erysiphe, and that this group has hecome developed in tropical. lands along lines
more or less parallel to those along which the European forms have proceeded in tem-
perate climates, being, in fact—though not in the strictest sense perhaps—* represen-
tative 8pecies.” Be this view entertained or rejected, I am strongly impressed with
the necessity for further and closer investigation of the very remarkable group of fungi
centering around or near the Meliole, since they will probably fill up yet more com-
pletely the gap—partially bridged over, it is true—between the lower and higher
Ascomyeetes.
