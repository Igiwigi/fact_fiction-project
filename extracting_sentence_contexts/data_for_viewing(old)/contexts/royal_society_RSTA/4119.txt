We need to reconcile the irregularities of microstructure with the assumed continua of
computational methods of modelling through an integrated multi-scale approach to design. This
requires integration of scientific disciplines, skills and understanding across a broad spectrum
of size scale. And this comes from the condensation of a wealth of knowledge of experimental
information and applied analytical procedures, and from the application of modelling of various
kinds including computer-based high-fidelity simulation.

If we begin design at the micrometre level of size (or below), basic research seeks a detailed
understanding of the problem of structural failure through elegant modelling or experimentation
with conspicuous absence of immediate need for solution or time constraints. At the other end
of the size scale, solutions to applied structural problems need not necessarily be complete and
in fact a full understanding of the situation is rarely required. These solutions require synthesis,
optimization, approximation and ‘feel’, and they generally have a time constraint. The benefits


include shortening of the design cycle time (reducing costs), optimization of safe performance of
structure and raising confidence levels in life prediction of highly stressed structures.

There is another set of issues that cannot be ignored and runs through these papers like 3

discipline also be interdisciplinary? Perhaps it is the last of these questions which gave the editors ig
