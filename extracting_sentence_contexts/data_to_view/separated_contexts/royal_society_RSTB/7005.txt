MEARE HEATH TRACKWAY

(a) Situation and circumstances

Dr A. Bulleid, F.S.A., in 1933 published an account of the discovery of a prehistoric
trackway crossing Meare Heath (Bulleid 1933). The substantial and elaborate nature of
its construction, and the fact that it had not been datable by archaeological means, led
us to attempt its rediscovery, its relationship to the bog stratigraphy, and its dating by
> pollen-analytic methods. Dr Bulleid described the line of the trackway with close accuracy and we were able to
confirm its presence along the line given by him, but far south of any exposures he had
seen. Acting upon advice given by the turf cutters we saw portions of the trackway close
to the boundary of Shapwick Heath next to the flank of the Polden Hills.
