Figure 1 shows the
relative tensile strength (RTS), ogH2/oBHe, and the relative reduction of area (RRA), $H2/Â¢He, as
functions of the TS of the material. Regardless of the susceptibility, the RTS values remain at ~1.0
in the TS regime up to +1000 MPa, although the ductility represented by the RRA is significantly
dependent on the material type, as demonstrated in figure 1. Based on such experimental facts,
moderate-strength steels with TS <1000MPa are generally selected for use in high-pressure
hydrogen components, the main focus of this paper. The FCG behaviour in metallic materials under the influence of hydrogen has been studied by
several researchers [3-16]. They have reported on a host of materials in which the FCG accelerates
in a hydrogen gas environment and under hydrogen charging, whereas little acceleration has
been noted in others, including stable, austenitic stainless steels and aluminium alloys.
