regular.

The fact that I, arose on the opposite side of the apex from the normal when the
angle I,-I, exceeded 180° supports the theory, mentioned in the introduction, that each
primordium arises in the largest gap between the previous primordia. For I, occupied
the larger gap between I, and I;, on whichever side of the apex it lay. Moreover, it is in
accordance with this theory, that when I, arose on the opposite side of the apex from
that on which it would normally have arisen, the genetic spiral continued in the reverse
direction from then onwards. For in normal Fibonacci phyllotaxis, such as that of the
Lupin, since three primordia make up a cycle, the gap in which each subsequent
primordium falls is the gap between the next older primordium but one, and the next
older but two, as can readily be seen from fig. 5, A. And within this gap, the new
primordium falls rather closer to the older of the two primordia on each side—a fact of
which the explanation will become clear below. Normally, therefore, I, would have
fallen in the gap between I, and I;, and on the opposite side of the apex from I, (see
fig. 5, A). But after the isolation of I,, when I, arose between I, and I, on the opposite
side of the apex from its normal position, it did not allow room for I, to arise on that
side of the apex (see fig. 5). Consequently I, also arose on the opposite side of the apex
from its normal position, and rather closer to I, than to Is, in the other angle between
I, and I;. As a result, I,, I, and I, constituted a cycle of primordia, of which the
genetic spiral ran in the reverse direction. The subsequent primordia arose, as in
an intact plant, in the gaps between the next older primordium but one, and the next
older but two, and thus the genetic spiral was continued indefinitely in the reverse
direction, .
