the west side of the Mer de Glace between the Angle and Trelaporte, exactly under the
little glacier of Charmoz. The part adjoining the western shore of the glacier is in-
deed highly crevassed, and therefore unfit for this experiment ; but at the distance of
fifty or sixty yards from the moraine it becomes remarkably flat and compact for a
space of about seventy yards in width, and several hundred yards in length, throughont
which space there is not a single open crevasse. Now this compact area of ice pre-
sents the veined structure in a nearly longitudinal direction, with a degree of delicacy
and distinctness not to be found in any other part of this glacier (as I had already re-
marked in my Travels, p. 159), and it contains no other trace of a system of longitn-
dinal fissures or lines of separation of any kind, which could render mechanically
possible the distortion of this flat compact surface of 80 great an extent. Now I have
always observed that the veined structure near the side of a glacier is best developed
where the ice is least crevassed, or the continuity of the mass most perfect ; a fact
stated and referred to its true canse from the first date of my speculations on the origin
of the blue veins, in the following words :—© The veined structure invariably tends to
disappear when a glacier becomes 80 crevassed as to lose horizontal cohesion, as when
it is divided into pyramidal masses. Now this imwediately follows from our theory ;

for as soon as lateral cohesion is destroyed, any determinate inequality of motion ceases,
each mass moves singly, and the structure disappears very gradually *.” Now the ice
at the point in question is the compacted ice which has just passed round the great
promontory of Trelaporte, having been rent by numberless chasms, and which is con-
