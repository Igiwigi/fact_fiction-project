by experimental means.

6. A laminate failure assessment methodology

While the physical modelling of failure in composites has still challenges to meet, a roadmap to
reaching the goal can be outlined. Such a map is laid out in figure 7. As indicated there, the first
step is to characterize the microstructure of the composite as it results from the manufacturing
process used. The characterization of the microstructure is to be at a scale needed for the failure
analysis. Thus, depending on which failure mode is being analysed, e.g. a fibre failure mode
in a UD composite, the choice of the microstructural region will be accordingly. In each case,
the microstructural region must also include the appropriate manufacturing defects (e.g. fibre
misalignment) within the region. This region, often called the representative volume element
(RVE), is denoted here as real initial material state (RIMS) to capture the fact that it represents
the ‘real’ material state as produced at the end of the manufacturing process, i.e. ‘initially’, when
the composite is placed in the service environment. The realization of RIMS is labelled as RVE-1
and RVE-2 at the lamina and the laminate levels, respectively. The stress and failure analysis of
the appropriate RVE will generate the conditions (criteria) for the particular failure mode. The
failure conditions for lamina failure modes will enter the RVE-based analyses of the subsequent
failure modes in a laminate.

7. Concluding remarks

A scrutiny of the fundamentals of the common failure theories advanced over the past many
years reveals the inherent deficiency of the theories to treat the range of failure mechanisms
observed. This deficiency is rooted in homogenizing the composite microstructure and thereby
