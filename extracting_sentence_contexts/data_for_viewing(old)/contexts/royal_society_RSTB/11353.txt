tively small numerosities (less than 7) in the case of discrete
quantities. Intriguingly, the topographical map of number
in humans seems to be limited to the right hemisphere, for
no clear topographical organization is apparent in the left
hemisphere [72]. However, there is no evidence of this in
other species and, more importantly, it is unclear how such
topography, which maps increasing magnitudes from the
medial to lateral portion of the parietal cortex, would produce
the pattern of response that we observe in behaviour, with
small numbers being more likely to produce a response to
the left and large ones to the right. One can speculate on
mirror organizations of the topography in the two hemi-
spheres, but this seems not to be the case (in fact, there is no
topographical organization at all in the left hemisphere; see
above) and, besides, the functional reason for such mirror-image
inversion, if existing, would be entirely mysterious.

Another possibility is that numerical and spatial cognition
rely on common neural circuits [74,75], for the lateral and ven-
tral intraparietal areas seem to play a role in both number and
spatial processing in primates. Drucker & Brannon [75] argued
