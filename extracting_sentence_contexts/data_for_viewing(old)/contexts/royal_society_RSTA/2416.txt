5Note that a fusion reactor is intrinsically a much more complex apparatus than a fission reactor, due to the combination of
a.o. a vacuum vessel, high-field superconducting magnetic field coils and power production inside a cryostat.


production has reached approximately 1% of the world energy demand. The ensuing linear
growth typically takes several decades.

In summary, we have identified several major hindrances for the rapid deployment of fusion
power that are of economical nature. They all pivot around the point that fusion power plants
are large, complex installations, with a long construction time and large overnight investment
compared to any other source. This precludes an effective innovation cycle. This is exacerbated
by the fact that the proof of principle is of such a size that the innovation path starts at a level of
investment that is not found in any other technology.

7. How about the options to make fusion available earlier?

The workshop addresses the question if fusion can be realized earlier. In the above analysis,
we have shown that a realistic expectation is of the development path that starts where the
EUROfusion roadmap ends, i.e. with a DEMO reactor in 2060, implies that fusion will only :
make a significant contribution to energy generation well past 2100, and we have indicated which :=
economic factors constrain that development. I=

The third scenario (C) in figure 2 explores the most optimistic case of ‘acceleration of fusion :B
power’ by bringing forward the DEMO point to 2030 (which assumes that a much smaller DEMO. 1p
