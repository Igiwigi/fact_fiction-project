for 8ome time, caused the muscle to shorten. Galvanic stimulation to the muscle

happens that a muscle which exhibits little or no shortening before stimulation,
becomes progressively shortened after a number of stimuli have been applied, until
the basal line of the curve it describes is far above the normal.

The pressure which is sufficient for the circulation of an acid solution, as a rule,
quickly becomes insufficienb to maintain the free circulation of an alkaline s0lution.
This is to be expected from the fact that an alkali causes contraction of the involuntary
muscular fibres of the vessels, and is in unison with GasKeLL's observation.

The first effect of an alkaline solution, as a rule, is to increase the contractility of
the muscle on stimulation ; the same stimulus producing a greater contraction than
ib would in the muscle without such circulation. A gradual shortening of the

S muscle, independently of any active contraction, is produced by the alkaline solution :
A this is shown by the rise of the basal line in the curve. After the circulation has
= been maintained for some time, both the contractile power and the irritability of the
- musecle decrease ; the height of the contraction occurring on stimulation not being 80
= greab, and a stronger stimulus being required.
