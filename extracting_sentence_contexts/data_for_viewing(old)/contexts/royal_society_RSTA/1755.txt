These improvements of the parameters of the KrF laser systems allowed us to carry out : =
investigations on the reflectivity of laser light from solid targets up to 1.15 x 10'8 W cm“? intensity ZR

105 Wcm7?, i.e. the experiments of Gilicze et al. [26] were carried out at lower intensities. Here, : =
investigations for higher intensities are reported together with the study of conversion to x-rays. ao

The motivation of these experiments lies in the fact that a broad range of nonrelativistic intensity
could be covered, which allows us to obtain a clear picture of these phenomena. In comparison,
measurements were also carried out with pulses of moderate contrast of 5.5 x 10°, when the
prepulse intensity was high enough to generate preplasmas.

2. Methods

Our laser system used in the following experiments is an updated version of the Szatmari-type
hybrid-excimer laser system [29]. The KrF system is based on the amplification of a frequency
doubled output of a 500 fs distributed feedback dye laser oscillator-amplifier setup. The pulse
was amplified in a chain of discharge pumped KrF amplifiers of increasing cross-section. The
amplification is realized in two-pass off-axis geometry [29] in each stage. After the first pass in the
first amplifier, the pulse is sent through a pre-imaging system, comprised of a two lens telescope
