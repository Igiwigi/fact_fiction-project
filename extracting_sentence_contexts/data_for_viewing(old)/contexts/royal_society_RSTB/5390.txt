Ankyropteris corrugata is a small zygopterid fern found in the calcareous nodules of
the Lower Coal Measures of Lancashire and Yorkshire. It was first discovered by
Witt1amson (46, 6), who included it in his comprehensive genus Rachiopteris, giving it
the specific name corrugata on account of the fact that the external surface of the stem
in his specimen was thrown into a series of irregularly transverse, round-topped ridges.
The petioles were also described by him (46, c) under the name Rachiopteris insignis ;
WILLIAMSON recognised, however, that the petioles he had described as R. insignis
were those of R. corrugata, although he never actually published the fact (39).

Rachiopteris corrugata was later included in Corpa’s genus Zygopteris (15), in common
with other paleozoic ferns, the petioles of which were “ characterised by a vascular
strand having the form of an H in transverse section ” (41). It owes its present generic
name to Dr. Paut Bertranp, who, in his important memoir on the petiole-anatomy
of the zygopterid ferns (4), has revived, in a limited and more rigidly defined sense, the
name employed by STENzEL (42) in his sub-division of Corpa’s genus.
