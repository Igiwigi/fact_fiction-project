What the first according to the hierarchical structure of the training data, as
equation expresses, then, is that the output of the network at captured by the SVD. The time course of learning of each
time t can be described as the weighted sum of the dimensions dimension of the SVD follows a sigmoidal curve whose
of the SVD of the training data. What the second equation cap- parameters depend only on the overall strength of the dimen-

tures is the fact that the weight on each dimension follows a sion s; and its initial value a;(0). Three specific points are
