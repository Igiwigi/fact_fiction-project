collected in the district should be tested for their magnetic susceptibilities, with a
view to determining the origin of the local magnetic disturbances, and to ascertain
their connexion, if any, with the distribution of the known iron-ore deposits. The
magnetic survey was undertaken by Mr. WALKER with the aid of a grant from the
Royal Society. The geological aspect of the question was placed in the hands of
Dr, Ausrey Strawn, Director of the Geological Survey, who obtained the sanction
of H.M. Treasury for the employment of Dr. A. H. Cox as a temporary member of
the staff of the Geological Survey in order that he might carry out the geological
part of the work. The work of determining the magnetic susceptibilities of the
various rocks collected was undertaken by Prof. Ernest Wuson, of University of
London, Kingâ€™s College.

The geological examination of the district was greatly facilitated by the fact that
the whole area had recently been re-surveyed by the officers of H.M. Geological
Survey, and the results of their investigations shown on the Geological Maps and
Memoirs (list on p. 94).

It was thought desirable that a series of observations should also be made on some
known sheet of iron-ore with a view to determining the character of the disturbances
caused by the sheet. The district selected on the advice of Prof, H. Louis, the
Chairman of the Committee, was near Irthlingborough in Northamptonshire. This
district was chosen as being the largest sheet of unworked ferrous carbonate known
to him suitable for the experiment, as its boundaries had been determined with great
accuracy. It is now being opened out by the Ebbw Vale Iron Company. Accord-
ingly a series of similar observations was made in that district also by Mr. WatKER,
