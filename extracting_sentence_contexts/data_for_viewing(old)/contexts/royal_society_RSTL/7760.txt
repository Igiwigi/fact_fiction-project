by different authors of its division into two vessels, it appeared to me very strange that
with such a clear description of the mode of division nothing at all, or only very little,
$hould be said about the mode of development of the semilunar valves attached to the
commencement of these vessels. KOLLIKER is the only author I have been able to find
who makes any mention of their mode of development, and his account, which IT shall
presently quote, is very brief and unsatisfactory. Nowhere have I found any drawings
of these parts in their rudimentary state. I was therefore obliged to conclude that very
little was known about this point, probably in consequence of the difficulty of accurately
examining such minute parts at an early period of development, and I was hence led to
attempt the obseryations recorded in the present paper. 'They were made during the
years 1865, 1866, and 1867, on the embryo of the common domestic fowl, artificially
incubated. Though not nearly as complete as T could have wished them to be, they
nevertheless demonstrate certain new and interesting facts connected with the develop-
ment of the semilunar valves, and the formation of the aorta and pulmonary artery in
the bird's heart. These appear to me to be valuable, as possibly throwing light on some
of the congenital malformations of this part of the heart. In working at the deyelop-
ment of the semilunar valves, I was also obliged to examine very closely into the mode
of division of the truncus arteriosus into two vessels, and found that the manner in which
it becomes divided differs from that usually described to occur in some very important
particulars. The development of the semilunar valves is s0 closely connected with the
process of division of the truncus arteriosus that I have found it best to unite the
description of each stage of the one with that of the corresponding stage of the other.
As the satisfactory examination of these minute parts is difficult, and requires a pecu-
