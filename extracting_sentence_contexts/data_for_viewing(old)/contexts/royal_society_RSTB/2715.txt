The aperture from its constancy in occurrence and position may be regarded as
indicating some feature original to the skull, most probably a foramen, which has
been enlarged by subsequent decomposition. We consider that it gave exit to the
optic nerve, possibly to the fifth and seventh as well.

In front of the enlarged optic foramen no constant vacuity is met with in the side
walls of the skull, we look in vain for such an aperture as might have afforded egress
to the olfactory nerve. But precisely at that point, where the sudden flexure of the
cranial walls occur, there is an easy way into the anterior compartment of the nasal
capsule, through which the nerve may have passed. :

The posterior opening of the cranial cavity, corresponding to the occipital foramen,
is not completed by a roof, a fact rendered all the more remarkable by the presence,
immediately behind it, of the neural arch of the first vertebra, still retaining its
original position with regard to the skull or only slightly displaced to a lower level,
although the body of the vertebra has been separated from it, and turned over so as
to lie on its articular face. The arch is far from well preserved, however, and is
usually in a very fragmentary condition. The absence of an occipital arch in the
