an n-nucleotide code, then the components of G(X) are exactly the graphs

G(X) = (V(X), E(X)) forlsjsn-1

with
V(X)j = {N1.. Nj, Nga. Na Ni. Nn—j/Nn—j41-»-Nn = NiN2N3...Nn € X}

and

E(X)j ={[Ni...Nj,Njga--- Nn], [Ni ..-Nn—j,Nn—j4a---Nn]:NiN2N3...Nn € X}.

These components do not have to be connected, as we can see in figure 3. However, quite often
they are. In fact, G(X); consists exactly of the nodes (and their corresponding edges) that interpret
the elements of X in two ways: as a pair of a j-nucleotide and an (n — j)-nucleotide and as a
pair of an (n — j)-nucleotide and a j-nucleotide. Note that by symmetry we have G(X); = G(X)n—;
for all j <n —1. For instance, in figure 3 the two components of the graph associated with the
tetranucleotide code are G(X); (=G(X)3) and G(X)2. The next observation is obvious.
