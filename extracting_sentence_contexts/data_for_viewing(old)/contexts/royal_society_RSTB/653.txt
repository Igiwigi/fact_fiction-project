fibres be situated in the spinal cord, the only way in which the explanation will hold
good is by supposing that such fibres are recurrent, as CLAUDE BerNarp has suggested,
and that they loop back in the plexus, at the junction of the motor and sensory roots.t
The only other way that the degeneration of these fibres can be explained is by

supposing that certain fibres derive their trophic supply in some way from the
periphery ; but I know of no facts that support any such supposition.

VI. Summary AND CoNCLUSION.

From the results of the various methods of experimentation already detailed, I feel
that I am justified in coming to the following conclusions :—

1. Stimulation Experiments.

1. The compound movement obtained by stimulation of a whole nerve root is a well
coordinated one, depending on the action of a group of muscles in synergic combina-
tion, as Ferrter and YEo* showed to be the case in the Monkey.
