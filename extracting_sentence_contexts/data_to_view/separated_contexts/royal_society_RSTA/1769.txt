Joule heat and
thermal diffusion work together during the heating stage. This temperature rise of the sample
is determined by the excitation frequency, the heating time, the high-frequency magnetic field at
the sample surface and characteristics of the material such as electrical conductivity, magnetic
permeability, thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity. In fact, the control loop looks for
the resonant frequency of the excitation source and the coil current is not an ideal sinusoidal
expression in the initial stage. This time has an impact on the temperature rise.

The excitation source for ECPT is actually an induction heating power supply system and the
schematic diagram of this system is illustrated in figure 2. Since electricity is rectified and filtered,
a DC voltage Ug is generated and this drives the full bridge converter.
