This tract of fibres, to which Hamttron has given the name of “crossed callosal
tract,” degenerates, according to our observations, in a corticipetal direction, and
passes from the optic thalamus to the cortex of the opposite cerebral hemisphere. A qritical examination of this series of experiments leads to some important
conclusions. First, in two of the cases, viz., those in which there was a destructive lesion of the
tegmentum cruris, the clinical phenomena were permanent anesthesia and analgesia
of the whole of the opposite side of the body, facts which indicate that in the region
lying external to the red nucleus, and between the anterior quadrigeminal body and
the substantia nigra, is situated the sensory tract of the tegmentum cruris (Plate 2,
fig. 6). In this region lie the mesial fillet, the central auditory tract, and ascending
fibres of the posterior quadrigeminal budy. This last structure may be destroyed as
