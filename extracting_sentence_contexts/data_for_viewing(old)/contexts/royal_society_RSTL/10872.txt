fibre, and probably the same remark applies to muscle hazmoglobin ; for after all the
opposite conelusion is mainly based on Kine and EBrrrn's observation of the
presence of a living nematode within the sarcolemma, and this does not altogether
exclude the possibility of the presence of a colouring matter in the sarcous substance.

T have not insisted 8trongly on the fact that myohamatin is a histohamatin, as
anyone cannot fail to come to that conelusion who studies the accompanying charts.
Myohzmatin then may be considered as the true intrinsic colouring matter of muscle,
and the histohzmatins the intrinsic colouring matters of the tissues and organs ; both
may be reinforced or replaced at times by hemoglobin when extra activity of internal
respiration is required ; probably the same radical may be made use of for building up
all these pigments, at all events they seem to be related, since the same decomposition
product—hematoporphyrin—is probably yielded by all of them. The fact that in the
lower animals pigments of less complex molecular structure than haemoglobin and
identical with its decomposition products can function like it, forces itself on anyone's
attention who studies the pigments of the Invertebrata.

Lastly, I would call attention to another striking fact which IT have found out,
thanks to Professor MoseLEY. In his most valuable Paper* on © animal colouring
mafters,” which he discovered while on board the * Challenger,” he describes a madder-
coloured pigment named by him polyperythrin, and he snggested that it might have
80me connexion with some of the pigments found by me in Actinie.t Tt was found
by Professor MosELEy in simple stony corals of very different genera, in two forms of
Actinize from deep water, and jn certain hydroids. In the drawing accompanying
Professor MoseLegy's Paper he figures an acid and an alkaline spectrum, and it will be
