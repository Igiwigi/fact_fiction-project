cross-link concentration, it is possible to obtain a shear modulus jz ranging from 100 Pa to 10 kPa. : S
For example, if we consider two hydrogel layers with H, = Hy (figure 2b), where the clamped one : Ss
has jug = 300 Pa and the other zp = 600 Pa, we find that yer ~ 4.4366. Accordingly, an instability 78

would appear at Hy > MaYer/(g) X 13.57 cm.
The general case in which a, #1 is a bit more complex; in fact, equation (3.14) can be written
in the following compact form:
cy? +oay+c3=0, (3.15)

where the coefficients cj, cz and cz depend on ay, &,, &» and k, as reported in appendix B.

Even if their expressions are very cumbersome, we can still make some general observations.
In fact, we observe that c; does not depend on a,, whereas, if we fix the other variables, cz has a
different sign if a» > 1 or if 0 <a, <1. Hence, one of the two real roots of equation (3.15) changes
sign if we consider a, > 1 or 0 <a, <1.

Thus, we make a distinction in the following between these two cases, which physically
correspond to the two configurations depicted in figure 1.

(i) Case (a): free surface instability (y > 0)

The configuration shown in figure la undergoes a morphological transition if equation (3.15)
possesses at least a positive root for y, because we assume g > 0.

In figures 4 and 5, we depict the marginal stability curves y(k) when we vary the parameters
