of interconnected individuals [1]. Their most evident taxonomic characteristic is the presence
of a specialized cell wall, known as the frustule, that is in large part made up of silica [2].
This cell wall consists of two intricately sculpted units, the valves, that are linked together
through a structure called the girdle, enclosing the cell as within a closed Petri dish. The
ability of diatoms to produce beautiful micro- and nano-structures through silica biogenesis
has received great attention recently for its potential application in nanotechnology [3,4] and
photonics [5,6]. Moreover, diatoms are essential for global-scale biogeochemical cycles [7-10]
(including carbon [11,12] and silica [13]), greatly influencing the functioning of the whole marine
ecosystem [7]. For instance, it is estimated that diatoms produce by photosynthesis as much
organic carbon as half the terrestrial rainforests combined [11,14]. But as opposed to plants, this
organic carbon is rapidly consumed, serving as the base for the marine food-web, supporting
fisheries in coastal waters and the flourishing of micro-organisms at depth [15]. Moreover, their
sedimentation transports approximately 6.3 Tmol of silica per year to the deep ocean [13]. In fact,
global ocean fluxes of organic matter are partly controlled by this coupling between the sinking of
decaying phytoplankton blooms and aggregates [16-18] and other biophysical processes (such as
particle coagulation [16] and diatom-bacteria interactions in the so-called phycosphere [19-22]).

Because they prevalently lack motility (gliding has been observed only in some benthic
species [23-25]), the dynamics of diatoms is influenced by two factors, advection by fluid flows
and sinking due to density mismatch with seawater. But contrary to long-time beliefs, these micro-
organisms are not solely passive particles. Indeed, they have developed the ability to actively
regulate their buoyancy (and therefore their sinking speed) in response to environmental cues,
notably light and nutrient availability [26,27]. This regulation inevitably impacts the sinking
dynamics of diatoms and, as a consequence, has the potential to significantly affect the fate
of diatom blooms, their reproductive strategies [28], the vertical transport of organic matter
