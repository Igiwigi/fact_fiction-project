rent planes, I endeavoured to discover some general law, ac-
cording to which the direction of the deviation depended on
the direction. of the rotation of the plate ; s0 that the situation

the direction of rotation being given, we might point out
immediately the direction in which the-deviation would take
place.

On comparing together all the facts which I have detailed,
I found that this might be effected in the following manner.
I refer the deviations of the horizontal needle to the devia-
tions of magnetic particles in the direction of the dip, or to
those of a dipping needle passing through its centre ; s0 that,
in whatever direction this imaginary dipping needle would
deviate by the action of the iron, the horizontal needle would
deviate in such a manner as to be in the same vertical plane
with it : thus, when the north end of the horizontal needle
deviates towards the west, and consequently the south end
towards the east, I consider that it has obeyed the deviation
of the axis of the imaginary dipping needle, whose northern
extremity has deviated towards the west and its southern
