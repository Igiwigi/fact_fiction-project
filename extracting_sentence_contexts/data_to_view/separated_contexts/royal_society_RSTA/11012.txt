For typical oscillators 27p,/p, seems to vary from °3 to *5, hence p,= "3 to 5 X v/h,

Take B= — EI, and we see that V is the potential* due to a “double point”
of moment oscillating between +- E/e~”' and — Ele”; thus the maximum charges
rapidly diminish with the time. In fact, we have a system entirely analogous with
that of Herrz, except for this rapid diminution of the maximum charges with the
time. It is in this running down of the maximum charges that the damping effect of
the oscillator consists.

(3.) We shall now proceed to find the forces. Tn the first place let us find the value of p dy/dp, which, following Herz, we will
term Q.
