errors) and +1 frame-shift immunity. Such features explain why the evolutionary pressure might
have led to the selection of this mechanism. In fact, accuracy in protein synthesis needs to
have been preserved to some extent in actual organisms and the preservation of the degeneracy
distribution over geological times might be the molecular evidence of such origin. Note that it
has been proposed that extant triplet codes derive from primeval codes having codons with
more than three nucleotides [21]. This could ensure the necessary bonding stability for direct
decoding without ribosomes. Moreover, the feasibility of decoding codons of four letters has been
demonstrated with evolved extant ribosomes [22]. In [23], ribosomes have been made evolving to
reduce premature termination; in [24], such ribosomes further evolved so as to obtain the same
fidelity and efficiency as with triplet codons. These ribosomes were termed ribo-Q due to their
capability to efficiently read quadruplet codons.

Regarding the connection with extant decoding strategies, both the non-power model and
the hypothesis of primeval symmetric tRNAs provide an exact prediction about the number of
