Still immature, the caudal portion being as yet shbort and imperfect.

In the female the ovaries were distended with eggs and occupied the whole of the
visceral cavity between the intestines. The eggs were of a sooty black colour, with
but a slight trace of the grey surface, and appeared to be nearly mature, but had not
yet left the ovary. The germinal vesicle of a large size, circular in its outline, and
Somewhat flattened, still existed in nearly the whole of them,

It is thus evident that the pairing of the sexes, both of Frogs and Toads, takes
place before the semen is fully matured, or the eggs have descended into the oviducts,
and that there is a near concurrence in the time of maturity in both.

These facts seem to lead to the conclusion, that when, as in some of the fore-men-
tioned experiments, the male fluid contains a very large proportion of developmental
cells, which occasion its white appearance, it is not fully matured for its function ;
that the first portions of fluid which descend into the efferential vessels are usually
immature; and that it is not absolutely necessary that the spermatozoa sbould be fully
formed before the cells escape from the testes. It seems fair then toinfer from these
facts that the completion of the development of the spermatozoal bodies takes place
in the deferential vessels, or in the vesicles, perhaps in both: further, that the
quantity of fluid produced, when too great to be contained in the ducts, may become
accumulated in the vesicles, to be furnished at the instant it is required; and that
there is a near concurrence in the time of maturity in the fluid in the male, and of
the eggs in the female, the former being only slightly in advance, in regard to time,
of the latter, at the natural period of their encounter; a condition which perhaps
