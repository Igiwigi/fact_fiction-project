At low pressures the film becomes too attenuated to
ensure complete protection, and, in consequence, the formation of steam is accelerated
by reason of hydrogen penetrating through on to the oxide and reducing it. In
conformity with this idea, the rate of steam formation when the gases are not
present in combining ratios was found to be proportional to the partial pressure
of the oxygen. In the cases of the other reducible oxides examined, the fact that the gases
combined at moderate temperatures, without permanently altering the surface, and at
rates always far in excess of the rates at which either the surface was reduced by
hydrogen, or the reduced surface re-oxidised, does not harmonise with the purely
chemical theory. It is difficult to resist the conclusion that in these cases also the
catalytic action is primarily due to a physical condensation of one or other of the
reacting gases at the surface. And since in all experiments where the gases were
not present in combining ratios the rate of combination was always proportional to
the partial pressure of the hydrogen, it would appear to be the hydrogen which is
condensed and so rendered active.
