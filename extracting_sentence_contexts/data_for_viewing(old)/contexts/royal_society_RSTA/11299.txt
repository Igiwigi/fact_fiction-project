The nuclei produced by the action of ultra-violet light differ in many ways from
‘sthose produced by X-rays or Uranium rays.

The expansion required to make water condense upon them depends on the strength
Yof the radiation, and when this is strong, only a very slight expansion is necessary, as is
Zshown in Experiments (1) and (29) in the above table. The smallest expansion of
B which the apparatus admitted was, in fact, sufficient to form a fog with strong
radiation, and indeed, in later experiments, fogs were obtained without any expansion.
2Under the action of the weakest rays used, however (Expts. 30-39), the expansion
“required to obtain condensation is as great (p = about 150 millims.) as that required
&to catch the nuclei produced by X-rays.

3. The expansion required to make condensation take place on these nuclei depends
‘Bon the time during which the apparatus has been exposed to the action of the rays
before the expansion, being less the longer the exposure. The number which can be
Acaught by a given expansion also increases with the time of exposure. (See Expts.
16-21, 23-29.) The nuclei thus appear to grow under the action of the ultra-violet
rays. The increase in the size of the nuclei, or in the number exceeding a given
size, does not, however, continue indefinitely with increasing time of exposure, but
