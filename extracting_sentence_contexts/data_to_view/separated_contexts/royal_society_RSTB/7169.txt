Under experimental conditions it is possible to control the responses in such a way that
they cause vision to change slowly either from trichromatic to monochromatic vision, to
change in the reverse direction, or to remain poised at some stage in between the two. Under normal conditions of vision, on the contrary, they must operate with extreme
rapidity, as fast in fact as sight itself. If a grating test object be prepared, consisting of alternate parallel strips, 1 cm. wide, of
plain yellow paper and newsprint, and if this be examined at a distance of about 2 m., the
yellow strips appear a uniform yellow and the newsprint appears sharp and free from
colour.. Moving the gaze rapidly from point to point does not noticeably alter the conditions.
