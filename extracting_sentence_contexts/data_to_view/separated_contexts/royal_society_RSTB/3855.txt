DR. E. A. NEWELL ARBER ON THE FOSSIL FLORAS OF THE WYRE FOREST. 409

The fact that Cordaicarpus Cordai (Gein.) occurs in the first 200 feet, and
Lonchopteris rugosa Brongn. within the first 360 feet of this boring indicates that
the whole of the beds passed through belong to the Middle Coal Measures. This
conclusion is in harmony with the evidence of the plants collected by Mr. Canrrin.*
and determined by Dr. Krpston (see p. 407) from the surface beds in this area, and
with Roperts’ specimens from this region in the British Museum, if we except the
records of Pecopteris oreopteridia (Schl.)
