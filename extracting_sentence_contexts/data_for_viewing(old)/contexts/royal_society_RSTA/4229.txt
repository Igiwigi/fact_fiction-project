range—particularly below 0.05 Hz [13,17,19,20]—with regard to the ETCO? input. Therefore, the
nonlinearities are expected to be associated primarily with the PDMs that exhibit resonant peaks
in that frequency range. This is, in fact, observed in the ANFs shown in the PDM-based model
of figure 2. However, when we assess the statistical significance of the obtained estimates of
the ANF coefficients using p-values (under the assumption of system stationarity), we observe
significant nonlinearity only in the quadratic coefficient of the first PDM of the ETCO2 input
(p = 0.039), as indicated in table 2 where the average (s.d.) values of these coefficient estimates
and the corresponding p-values are shown for the three PDMs of each input. It is also seen in
table 2 that several linear coefficient estimates do not rise to the level of statistical significance. In
the Discussion section, we consider the possible requirement of longer data records and/or larger
sets of subjects with respect to the statistical significance of nonlinear estimates, as well as the
possible effects of system non-stationarities on these results.

Although the PDM-based model separates the dynamics (PDMs) from the nonlinearities
(ANFs), it cannot be generally assumed that the system nonlinearities are ‘separable’ in terms
