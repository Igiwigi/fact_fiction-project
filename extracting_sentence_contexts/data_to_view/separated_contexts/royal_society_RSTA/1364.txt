In cases where acceleration of an MRI
acquisition is needed, while motion correction is required, deriving motion information from PET
data may prove a practical and useful approach. There has been considerable progress in motion compensation and especially in PET-MRI, and
some not commonly used commercial solutions which are available on the contemporary PET-
MR systems. The fact that different types of phenomena (e.g. motion, attenuation, noise in the
data and other) are intertwined, the availability of a large range of radiotracers with different
properties, a variety of scanning protocols (e.g. static versus dynamic), and the organs/diseases
of interest in humans and animals of variable size, physiology and anatomy, makes it particularly
challenging to create a universal solution [109]. A lot of hope has been placed in the use of artificial
intelligence and there are some promising emerging investigations along these lines which may
be able to offer solutions where the current methods, so far, have failed [110,111]. Data accessibility.
