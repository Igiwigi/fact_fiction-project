A, C, being arbitrary constants.

When the propellant is completely burnt, f = 0, and so R = C for any further travel.

There are apparently three constants A, B, C left arbitrary, but the constant ( can
be determined in terms of A by consideration of the fact that if p) is the shot-start
pressure and f, the corresponding value of f, then R = py when f = ho:

Also from the first of the equations of Scheme I quoted above, pp = 44(fo)/I since 1
is the initial value of « (for definition of J, see I.B., p. 351), so that

A$ (fo)/L= OL + Of, F0/(1 — fy),

The constant B is also determinable in terms of A, as will appear shortly.
Equation (4) now becomes
