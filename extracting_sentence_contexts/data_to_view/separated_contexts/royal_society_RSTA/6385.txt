of fossil fuels on the planet and we are quickly reaching the peak of their availability ([46]; see

the process of converting economies to renewable forms of energy is a long one, fraught with
all kinds of challenges and limitations. Consequently, it questions the fundamental assumption
in neoclassical economics that continual economic growth is possible and should be the goal
of all economic activity.
