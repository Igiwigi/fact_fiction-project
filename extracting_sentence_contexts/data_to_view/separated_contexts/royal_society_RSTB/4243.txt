Further, in the middle epoch the amplitude

for a period of exactly 52 weeks is very small compared with that found in the

preceding and succeeding epochs. This suggests that the source of the amplitudes

associated with the yearly period is to be sought rather in the organism of measles
_ than in the climatic variation of the seasons. Pursuing the same process of reasoning, it follows that the fact that the epidemic
period in Paris is exactly, or almost exactly, that of the solar year may be no more
than the expression of a coincidence between the length of a stage in the life-history
of the measles organism and the length of the solar year. In this connection there is
some evidence that in London epidemics with periods slightly greater or slightly less
than the solar year exist. Thus, in the epoch 1838-1913, the largest amplitude is
not for the exact solar year, but for a period slightly greater, as may be seen in
Diagram I; while for the middle epoch, though the amplitude for the exact solar
year is negligible, yet for a period of four days less an amplitude of 180 is found.
