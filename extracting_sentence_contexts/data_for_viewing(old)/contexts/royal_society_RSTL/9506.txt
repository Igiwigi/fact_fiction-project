446 MR. R. T. GLAZEBROOK ON DOUBLE REFRACTION

While for the violet ray, 9, the differences near both axes are negative. To bri
the two curves into agreement then we should require to decrease both the axes Hos [tax
This would produce a corresponding increase in all the positive errors and render the
variation from FresNEL's theory near the middle of the arc more marked than in the
case of the red or green rays.

In fact, while for the red, supposing the variations in p,, py contemplated above to
have been adopted, the greatest difference between theory and experiment, would be
about

0001
for the green ray F it would rise to
-00015
and for the violet, 9, to
Â©0002.
