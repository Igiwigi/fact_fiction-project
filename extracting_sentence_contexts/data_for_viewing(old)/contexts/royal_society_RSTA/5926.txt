The first hypotheses assert the validity of the Kolmogorov laws for weak solutions. Although
anticipated to be true (the 4/5-ths law is sometimes referred to as the only ‘exact’ law in
turbulence), to this day it has not been unconditionally established (see [44,45] for conditional
validations and figure 2 for empircal evidence). The second hypotheses concern some effective
alignment properties of the velocity increments with their separation vectors. A detailed
discussion is deferred to the subsequent section. As stated above, they are slightly stronger
than hypothesis 2.3 required in the proof, but may be more convenient to verify numerically or in
experiment. In fact, there has already been direct evidence of the behaviour (1.10) with a ~ 0.03


from experiment [38-40] (see extended discussion in remark 2.5). In practice, (1.10) and (1.11)
need only be checked over the finite range of scales in the inertial range ¢, < ¢ « L. We prove

Theorem 1.2. Let 1 be a weak solution of the Euler equations of class 13(0,T; L3(T*)). Then

(a) if hypotheses 2.1(a) and 2.3(a) hold, then u € L?(0,T; Bo- 9/3. (pay),
(b) if hypotheses 2.1(b) and 2.3(b) hold, then u € L3(0, T; BS °(T4)),

Theorem 1.2(b) is not very surprising since hypothesis 2.3(b) (nearly) assumes control on [8
the absolute structure function by the longitudinal. We include it because there is experimental : —
