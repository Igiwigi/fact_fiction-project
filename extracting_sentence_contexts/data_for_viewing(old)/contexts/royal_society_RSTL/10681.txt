pumice-like aspect.

- In addition to the chert and porous siliceous rock, some of the sponge-beds in this
district consist of a hard, whitish, massive rock, of a granular character, filled with
Sepicules of a white porcelanic tint. The rock appears to be nearly entirely siliceous,
the silica is partly chalcedonic and partly amorphous, and in the globular form. The
——_ are of amorphous silica, similar to bhose at Warminster. Small cavities in
Sthis rock are filled with spicules partially cemented together.

E The sponge-beds of this locality are distinguished by the absence of calcite and the
Small proportion of glauconite and mica present in them. Their organic character
zhloes nob appear to have been hitherto noticed, although they have excited much
<attention, owing to the fact that over an extensive area numerous conical pits have
Sbeen made in them to extract the harder portion of the beds for economical purposes,
d these pits have been surmised to be the* remains of primitive dwellings.
-2 Blackdown Hills, Devonshire.—The beds of upper greensand age exposed in the
higher portion of the Blackdown Hills have formed the subject of numerous memoirs,
Sin which some reference is made to the occurrence in them of sponge-remains. The
Sdetached spicules met with here and at Haldon were first described and figured by
8Mr. E. Pareirr,t and Jater in a more complete manner by Mr. H. J. Carer, F.R.S.,t
=Sbut these authors do not, describe in detail the beds in which they occur. The beds have
Sformerly been extensively worked for whetstones and for building, and Dr. Frrrox $
gives full details of the beds employed, and the mode of manufacture of the whet-
VSstones, without, however, noticing their organic character.
