One of us, being the Medical Officer for Dundee, made arrangements for the year
1884 with the various Registrars of Deaths in the town, whereby, in addition to the
information which is usually given on the registration of death, full particulars were
also obtained of the number of rooms and persons in the house in which the death
occurred, as well as of other similar data. This has enabled us to make a detailed
comparison of the death-rates with the composition of the air in various classes
of dwelling-houses. This, we believe, is the first time such a comparison has been made, and is, in fact,
the first time it has been possible, owing to the lack of necessary data. The following
Table represents the results we have thus obtained. In constructing this Table, there
has been a difficulty as regards the deaths occurring in the Infirmary and Poor-houses.
