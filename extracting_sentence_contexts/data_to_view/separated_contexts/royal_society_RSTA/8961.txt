It would seem at first sight that for very
intense waves the sensitivity of the phonometer could be reduced in the ratio of 6 to 1 by taking readings

with the resonator set at a position far removed from that giving resonance. On testing this conclusion
for the purpose of employing the phonometer to measure very loud blasts giving readings far off the scale
of the instrument when tuned to the exact frequency of the diaphone note, it was found that the propor-
tional relationship did not hold with any approach to accuracy. Although it was surmised that the reason
for this discrepancy was connected with the fact that the sound-waves were very much more intense than
any which had been hitherto dealt with by means of the phonometer, it was some time before a definite
clue was obtained as to the exact nature of the difficulty. While carrying out observations at the control
station on a specially calm day, the writer happened to make a slight adjustment of the resonator while a blast
was being sounded by the diaphone. A current of air could be distinctly felt blowing outwards from the
aperture of the resonator.
