conjecture (3.3) and plugging in (3.8)-(3.9), we obtain the result:

Z(-Z(2,3,7) =—-q 14+ q+ +t tq +297 +48 +29? +g 42g 4...) (10)

Note that the above leading terms in the q-expansion coincide (up to a sign) with the guess
(2.29) based on quantum modular properties and on q-hypergeometric identities. However, the
procedure outlined in this subsection does not immediately lead to a way to prove the modularity
of (3.10). We will see yet another way to compute Zo(-Z (2,3,7)) in the following subsection.

(b) Relation to indefinite theta functions

As mentioned earlier, one immediate problem with the proposal Za(—M3; 1)'=’Z,(M3; —t) (1.7)
is the fact that in definition 1.1 one has t ~ —t + M < —M, and after this flipping of signature
one no longer obtains a theta function ©," M (1.3) (and an integral (1.1)) that makes sense on the
upper-half plane.

While it seems to be the end of the road as far as definition 1.1 is concerned, a natural
possibility is to replace the naive theta series with a regularized theta function. Indeed, building
on previous work by Vignéras [31], Zwegers [32] has devised a way to define a regularization
for theta functions of signature (1,1) which retains its holomorphicity, and moreover established
the relation to mock theta functions. The regularization of general indefinite theta functions
and the relation to higher-depth mixed mock modular forms has recently been developed in
[33-37]. In [11], we apply these results to define and to compute quantum invariants for plumbed
three-manifolds that are not weakly negative.
