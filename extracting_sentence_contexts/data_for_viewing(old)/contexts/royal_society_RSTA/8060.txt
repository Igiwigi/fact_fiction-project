They were prepared by the method of Tscnucanrr,* and were purified by repeated
recrystallization from mixtures of ether and alcohol until the melting-points were sharp
and constant.

The seven xanthates are colourless or pale yellow, but they exhibit anomalous
rotatory dispersion, in the same way as the tartaric esters. They differ, however, from
these esters in showing two strong ultra-violet absorption bands at 3600 and 2800 A.
(approx.), instead of a weak general absorption. The dithiourethanes are of a bright
red colour, but their optical properties are very similar to those of the xanthates, from
which they differ mainly in the fact that the absorption bands are displaced in the
direction of longer wave-lengths to 5200 and 3300 A. (approx.), respectively.

The strongest ultra-violet absorption band of the xanthates is at 2800 A. (approx.).
It may be attributed provisionally to the >C=S group, since Purvis, Jones and
Tasker} and Hanrzscu and Scuarrt found a strong band between 2750 and 3050 A.
in a number of thion-, thionthio- and trithio-carbonates, all of which contain the
>C=S group. The much weaker band at 3600 A. (approx.) (which was not recorded
by TscuuGaEFF§) may be attributed to the group —S.CS—, since Hanrzscu
and Scuarr found a weak band of similar wave-length (3509 A.) in diethyl thion-
thiocarbonate, C,H,.0.C8.S.C,H,, but not in diethyl thioncarbonate,
