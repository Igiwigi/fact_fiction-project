The investigations on the foundations of geometry suggest the problem: To treat in the
same manner by means of axioms, those physical sciences in which mathematics plays an
important part; in the first rank are the theory of probabilities and mechanics.

Benjamin Yandell writes in his book about Hilbert’s problems [2]:

Axiomatizing the theory of probabilities was a realistic goal: Kolmogorov accomplished
this in 1933. The word ‘mechanics’ without a qualifier, however, is a Trojan horse.

Targue that the Greek soldiers hiding inside the Trojan horse—and coming out of it much later
in the fully developed theory—are the physical primitives contained in the axioms, i.e. in the
same laws of mechanics. In fact, being physical, the primitives require either a theoretical or an
operational definition. This means that, in both cases, they are not actually primitive, implying
that the logical feedback from their definition towards the same theory is prone to be logically not
coherent.

Let us analyse the case of mechanics. ‘Mechanics’ means dealing with ‘forces’ and their effects
on ‘bodies’. Both notions of ‘force’ and ‘body’ are pregnant with theory, and are not actually
primitive. For example, in Newtonian mechanics one needs to establish if a force is ‘real’ or
‘apparent’ (or, equivalently, whether the reference frame is ‘inertial’ or not*). However, only the

1For example, no general procedure is known to recover the classical trajectories of a set of particles from the solution of the
Schrédinger equation.
