share is taken by each half in the production of any given action.

It occurred to us that much might be learnt by regarding the tongue, at least for
the longitudinal muscles, as constructed of two similar halves ; further, that these
might be separated from each other by a vertical incision in the middle line, and this.
without injury to the nerve supply of each half.

Of course we recognize that this procedure involves the median* division of the
septal origin of the transverse muscular fibres and also the division of any hypo-
thetical nerve fibres crossing the raphe, but this does not invalidate the results we
obtained, and which show most definitely that the movements of both halves of the
tongue are represented in the hemisphere of each side respectively. For illustration
of our meaning, and for the better comprehension of the facts about to be related, we
may compare the question of this bilateral representation of the movements of the
respective halves of the tongue with those of the conjugate movements of the
eyes, and it will be seen presently that the common, and in hemiplegia previously
supposed unilateral, movement of the tongue is really a conjugate movement.

The operation of separation was performed by dividing the tongue along the
median plane from the hyoid bone and root of the epiglottis forward to the genial
tubercles. As a rule there was exceedingly little hemorrhage, and this was easily
arrested by pressure. The reflex movements of the tongue were as complete as
before, showing that the functions of the organ were not interfered with.

We will now take the movements of the tongue as a whole (see p. 54), and discuss
