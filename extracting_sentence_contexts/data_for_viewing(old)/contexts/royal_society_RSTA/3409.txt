Phase slips have been historically predicted by Little [1] as thermally activated topological
defects, but it is now assessed that they may occur even at zero temperature, due to quantum
tunnelling events [2].

A phase slip event, in fact, is an elementary excitation of the order parameter due to
thermal or quantum fluctuations, corresponding to a local suppression of its amplitude and a
simultaneous jump of the phase by 27. As a consequence of the phase slip event, the superfluid
metastable state, ie. a local minimum of the Ginzburg-Landau free energy F [3] with velocity
vx V¢(x), decays into a state with lower velocity, since the phase has locally unwound [1].
A phase slip can be thermally activated (TAPS) [4-6] when the temperature is higher than
the free energy barrier 5F between two neighbouring metastable states and the system may
overcome the barrier via thermal fluctuations. The nucleation rate of TAPS follows the Arrhenius
law FP xe FF /keT [4,5], making these events extremely improbable for T < 6F/kg. In this latter

regime, a second mechanism for the activation of phase slips becomes dominant: quantum : =
tunnelling below the free energy barrier, triggered by quantum fluctuations. This second type : a
of excitations has been called quantum phase slips (QPS) [2]. As the role of both thermal and : 2
