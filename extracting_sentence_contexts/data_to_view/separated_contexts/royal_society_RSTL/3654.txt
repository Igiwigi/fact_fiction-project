it was ſo faint and inconſfiderable in its diame-
.ter (rather leſs than one tenth of an inch) compared with
. the other light produced by the influence of 'the point,
'that-it manifeſtly confirmed the truth of the laſt obſer-
vation. Theſe facts being in my opinion {© clear and ſatisfac-
tory in regard to the great obje&t-we have had in view,
I think that any farther experiments reſpeRing the na-
'ture and uſe of conduftors are unnecefſary. I ſhall
therefore proceed:to make ſome general deductions from
what has been already related,

It ſeems to be clear, that in all experiments made with
pointed and rounded conductors (provided the circum-
ſtances be the ſame in both) the rounded-ones are by far
the ſafer of the two, whether the lightning proceed
from one or more clouds; that: thoſe are ſtill more ſafe,
which-(inftead of being, as Dr./ FRANKLIN recommends,
ten feet high) are very little, if at all, above the higheſt
part of the building itſelf; and that this ſafety ariſes from
the greater reſiſtance exerted at the larger ſurface. The luminous appearance at the end of the braſs ball,
occaſioned by the point in the thirty-fourth experiment,
manifeſtly ſhewed that there was an accumulation of the
fluid within that part of the ball, in conſequence of ſome

reſiſtance:


4 F from Lightning at Purfleet, 289
© reſiſtance: for when the reſiſtance at the ſurface of the
$ braſs ball was at laſt overcome by the influence the point
£ 'had upon the charge, the exploſion took place imme-
© diately; and that, not only between the two ſubſtitutes, ,
but alſo between the end of the leſs ſubſtitute and the
, Wont.
