]. Introduction

Quantum thermodynamics [1-3] is of importance for its possible contributions to classical
thermodynamics in the non-equilibrium regime, in addition to its relevance to e.g. nanoscience
and quantum information. A point is the fact that an element of a classical system is
fundamentally described by a set of dynamical/thermodynamical variables, whereas in
quantum mechanics the Hilbert space also accompanies. This ‘double structure’ in quantum
thermodynamics leads to diversity of the bath concepts. A typical example is the dephasing
bath [4], the role of which is to realize decoherence of a quantum state and therefore has no
classical counterparts.
