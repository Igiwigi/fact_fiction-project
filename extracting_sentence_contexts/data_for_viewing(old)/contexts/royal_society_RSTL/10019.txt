THE FROG, AND ON THE ACTION OF THE VAGUS NERVE. 1019

On the action of the vagus nerve upon the tonicity of the heart.

The question whether any particular influence upon the heart causes the relaxation
of the tisxue to become greater or less than the normal, is always attended with the
difficulty that it is impossible to say what the normal amount, of relaxation really is.
Thus with the ordinary rate of rhythm the amount of relaxation is always greater with
a slower beat than with a quicker one, a fact which is to be explained by the simple
supposition that the condition of contraction has not absolutely passed away when the
next contraction takes place unless the contractions follow at a slower rate than the

Sormal ; 80 that for this reason alone a greater relaxation mus occur if the vagus causes
A slowing of the beats and a less relaxation if the beats are made more frequent. On
Jhe other hand, if the tissue is relaxed when the rhythm of the beats is accelerated or
altered, we may then fairly speak of an increased relaxation of the tissue, and if the
zelaxation is less, when the rate is the same or slower, then we may speak of a
inished relaxation of the tisxne. Thus, for instance, every experiment shows that,
gnnscarin and lactic acid truly increase, while zodium hydrate and digitalin truly diminish
Fe normal relaxation of the tissue.
'Z Now in endeavouring to estimate the extent of relaxation in a hollow muscle like the
