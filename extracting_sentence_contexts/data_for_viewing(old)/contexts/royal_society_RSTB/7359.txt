resolved, as would be the case with gratings of similar fineness. Further, if their ampli-
tude is made much smaller than 3-6 then in this case also they are not resolved but are
found to be mistaken for straight lines. These effects may be explained on orthodox views
of cone function. The point of interest here is an effect observed during these tests, parti-
cularly with the curve having an image on the retina with a wave-length and amplitude of
7-24. The drawing of this curve consisted of seven complete waves. When the centre of this
curve was fixed by the observer, who, as before, used a correcting lens and an artificial
pupil, he noticed that the part near the fixation mark had a normal appearance but that
the ends seemed to wriggle as if they were living flagellae. The use of a red, green or blue
filter did not seem to alter the appearance materially. The explanation of this effect which
most closely fits the facts is that at the centre of fixation, where there is a cluster, small
