connection between the temperature of the room and the value of the result.

A series of blank experiments was then undertaken when the temperature of the
room was between 17° C. and 18° C. A setting havirig been made, the mercury was
lowered for a period comparable to that required for admitting the hydrogen residue
in an actual determination. On raising the pipette reservoir again it was found that
mercury had to be taken from the volume-adjuster in order to set the points. The
mean volume of mercury withdrawn in four very concordant experiments was 30 c.mm.,
so that actual determinations carried out at this room temperature would have been
1 part in 20,000 toolow. The experiment was repeated at a room temperature of 16° C.,
when the volume of mercury withdrawn was only 10 c.mm. ‘The inference is that, at
the room temperatures obtaining in series 5, the correction would have been negligibly
small, and this is confirmed by the above-mentioned fact that differences of 2° C. in
this temperature region had no detectable influence on the results. It was unfortu-
nately impossible to make blank experiments at these lower temperatures, unless we
had waited for the winter.

The error just discussed does not affect the first four series, where, after the hydrogen
residue had been admitted, and a rough adjustment made by running out mercury,
the ice in the baths was replenished before the final setting. During this time interval
the normal temperature conditions of the mercury in the tubes below the dead-space
level would have been established again.

For the reasons mentioned in the preface an excess of hydrogen had been taken in
all our experiments. It does not seem probable that any constant error would be
