The
tendeney to divide would of course exist in the liquid cylinder from the moment of
its formation ; but when the impulses due to the impact of the successive drops upon
an obstacle are conveyed back to the orifice, they materially assist this tendency, and
the stream consequently resolves itself into drops nearer to the orifice,

The normal vibrations of a liquid jet are thus completely and satisfactorily accounted
for; and PLaTgav by an ingenious train of reasoning, showed also that division
might even occur at other than the normal points, thus explaining SAavarT's
observation, that a jet could vibrate under the influence of tones about one-fifth
higher, and an octave lower, than its normal. Moreover, Lord RAYLEIGH in a later
paper + has pointed out that theoretically the lower limit of effective tones is not well
defined, thus bringing PLaTEav's theory into closer agreement with the facts
deseribed in this paper. Now, while it is impossible to deny to this theory the merits of simplicity, of firm
experimental foundation, and of being in harmony with facts previously known, there
are, I think, cogent reasons why it cannot be held to account for the new phenomena
described above. In the first place it is a fact of experience, already noticed by
