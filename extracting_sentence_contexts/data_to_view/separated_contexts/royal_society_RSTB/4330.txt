The general ground-tissue of the scales, low down, consists of generally uniform,
small rounded cells, averaging 10-20 in diameter. Their walls are somewhat
thickened, and are very definitely rounded off, so as to leave considerable inter-
cellular spaces (see text-fig. 3, g). From still lower regions of the scale, approaching its level of attachment to the
peduncle, Licnizr describes a central, soft, parenchymatous ground-tissue for the
scales, coupled with a general increase of sclerification in an upward direction, The
fact that the lowest level reached by the scales in the fragment of the new species
is still considerably sclerised, and not yet provided with a parenchymatous centre,
