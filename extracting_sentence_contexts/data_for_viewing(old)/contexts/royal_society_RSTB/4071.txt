right side, and especially when we introduce the electrode into the left chamber,
accurate location is almost impossible.*

The power of the left ventricle is so great and the wall so rigid that the electrode may
be unmanageable and the fling very considerable. Consequently we lay most stress
upon readings from the thin and free wall of the right chamber.

Internal and External Readings.

If we place one electrode upon the inner and the other upon the outer surface
immediately over it, so that the two contacts grip the muscle lightly between them ;
then the internal contact invariably receives the excitation current first. This fact is
clearly shown by Table XIII. The interval between the two readings (internal and
