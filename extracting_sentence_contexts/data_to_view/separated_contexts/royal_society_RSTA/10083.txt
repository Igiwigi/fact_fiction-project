Under ordinary circumstances the convection and conductivity of the gas itself are
the ruling factors which determine the rate of cooling. The thermal capacity of the gaseous mixture and the rate at which heat can be
transmitted through it are low compared with the corresponding properties of the
enclosure. These facts hold true whether the latter is water-cooled or not. In such cases neither the inner surface of the enclosure nor the layer of gas in
