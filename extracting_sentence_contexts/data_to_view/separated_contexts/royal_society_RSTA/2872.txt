Since legal certainty requires that citizens can
foresee how discretion will be used, there is a space for ‘legal regulation’ which basically
clarifies the policies developed by the regulator on how it will use its competences. As
Dworkin argued:

[D]iscretion is not the absence of principles or rules; rather it is the space between them.

3[22], referring to [23]. As I explained in other work,‘ without rules or standards the concept of discretion makes no
sense; the mere fact of being bound by a particular authority creates the need to judge whether a
norm applies, what decision it calls for and how it should be performed. The rule-bound nature of
discretion makes possible a discussion about the interpretation and employment of discretionary
competences; it allows a learning curve by requiring those who intervene to give reasons for their
actions if called to account. Those reasons are—in part—the norms that regulate their behaviour
as public officials, but in the end, those reasons also include the situated interpretation of those
norms.
