In effect, this contact
is very imperfectly established in the pile of entire frogs, and very great difference in
the intensity of the current is perceptible with the same elements by improving their
mutual contact. Whatever may be the right interpretation of the slight increase which occurs in
the intensity of the proper current, on touching the lumbar plexuses of the frogs,
and thus exciting muscular contractions, certainly this fact alone is insufficient to

lead us to admit the evolution of electricity during muscular contraction, while, as
certainly, all the other cases described oblige us to conclude the contrary. I will now proceed to detail several other new researches upon the phenomenon of
induced contractions: but I must first entreat that the reader will excuse my tres-
passing on his time with a lengthened account of my numerous experiments : the fact
of induced contractions is certainly of snch importance, and at the same time 80
obscure, that it cannot be established except by long and patient researches,

No one who has once seen induced contractions occasioned by contractions excited
by other means than an electric current, can hesitate to admit that this current is
not the direct cause which produces them. If the nerve of the galvanoscopic frog be applied upon the muscles of the thigh of
a frog prepared in the ordinary manner, and the spinal chord be suddenly lacerated
with scissors, or with the broken edge of a piece of glass, or by any other means, in-
duced contractions very rarely fail to occur. It is however certain that passing an
electric current through the lumbar plexuses, the phenomenon of induced contrac-
tions scarcely ever fails.
