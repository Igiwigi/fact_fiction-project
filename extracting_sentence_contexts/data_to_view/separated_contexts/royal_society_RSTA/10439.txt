In the next place, let three roots ¢, be equal, so that @ is the union of three
united points of f=F,~'F,. The point @ of Art. 15 (78) is now in the common
tangent plane, because it has been derived by the operation of f—¢, from another
point a. In fact we have

(F, —4F,) ac =F, (fF, —4F,)d=Fa . . . . (188);

and from the first of these it is obvious that SaF,@ = 0(=¢,~'SaF\@), while the
second may be written in the form

F, (a+ a@) = (t, + «) F, (« ae rg -) Asal ae x gree eae

This equation shows that the polar plane of the point a + aa‘ with respect to the

first quadric is identical with the polar plane of a + —— with respect to the
1

second; and because @ lies in the tangent plane, in the limit where « becomes

infinitesimally small, the two points become identical to the first order of «, and the
common polar plane becomes a consecutive tangent plane to both quadrics. The
quadrics have, therefore, stationary contact, and their function F,-'F, is of the
class I. The generators in the tangent plane are now found by expressing that «a + d is
on one of the quadries ; the equations may be written in the form

wt Sa Fy + 2at, Sa Fd + t,SdF,d =0; vSa Fy + 208 Fd + SdF,d =0 . (140),

where the equation for the first quadric has been reduced by the aid of (138), in
order that it may be compared with that for the second quadric.
