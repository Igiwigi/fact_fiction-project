of the follicle, in Myriapods and the Arachnida it bursts through the epithelial layer,

in the former at its free, and in the latter at its attached end.

If these characteristics are found eventually to hold good throughout the Myriapods
and Arachnida, the differences thus shown to exist between these groups will be of great
interest; but it is too early to generalize on the subject with much confidence. More-
over, it often happens that one or a few epithelial cells are attached in Arachnida to
the inner side of the follicle-wall. This happens, however (80 far as my observations
go). without any regularity, and the cells thus present fulfil perhaps no important
function in the formation of the egg. The Crustacea* appear to differ from the three
preceding groups in the fact that their eggs do not possess separate follicles. The
nuclei of the epithelial cells in the ovary of Oniscus are about x#7ths of an inch in
diameter, with a bright nucleolus; but along the inner edge of the oyary one or two may
generally be found as much as gogoths of an inch in diameter, but not otherwise differ-
ing from the small ones. Between these extremes all intermediate stages may with
patience be discovered.

When the epithelial nuclens has attained the above size, or even a little earlier, a
deposit of dark, structureless matter appears round it. This is the commencement of
the yelk, and has at first no bounding membrane, as the membrane of the cell itself
8eems to perish at a very early stage. It 800n, however, acquires a clearly marked
outline, though it is not until it is full-grown that any true membrane is formed
round it. The outline is, however, s0 clear and sharp that it is often difficult to belieys
