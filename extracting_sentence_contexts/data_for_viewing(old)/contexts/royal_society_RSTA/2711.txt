The previous expression shows that it is possible in principle to have chemomechanical
oscillations even with simple Langmuir kinetics and that, as long as (1 — £(o'Keq /(CoKeg + 1)) > 0,
only decreasing porosity functions are able to satisfy this condition. At this point, it would be
tempting to substitute equations (3.2)-(3.5) in (4.4) to test which types of porosity functions
would satisfy it, but should we adopt this straightforward approach, we would quickly encounter
difficulties. The problem is that the porosity that enters (4.4) is evaluated at the steady state, but
the steady state value of o explicitly depends on ot, which is in turn expressed as a function of
the porosity, leading to self-recursive definitions, which may greatly complicate the mathematical
treatment. Since the source of this self-recursiveness is the fact that the steady state value of o
depends on ot, we can overcome the problem by switching to the formulation in terms of the
fractional coverage 0, whose steady state value according to equations (4.1) and (4.2) is p=
KegCo/(KeqCo + 1). The 6 framework also offers the advantages of a more intuitive interpretation
of the microscopic properties of the solid matrix in relation to its adsorption-induced swelling,
and of working with a variable that is normalized between 0 and 1.
