Longitudinal sections show
Sthat the xylem elements are elongated, with annular or irregular spiral thickening :
here is no clearly marked phloem, and no bundle-sheath. The more central portion
Sf the mesophyll consists of elongated and pointed elements (tig. 37) ; the oblique
Herminal walls where two such elements adjoin one another are of irregular thickness,
And as 8een in surface view are marked with shallow pits: there is no special
#character of their cell-contents, and a nucleus is present. Ib seems probable that
this tissue replaces the phloem not only anatomically, bu also physiologically, in fact
hat ib is a rudimentary type of phloem. It is thus seen that the vascular bundle of
the leaf is of a very simple, type.
2 A peculiarity of structure is to be noted in the parenchyma at the base of the leaf. ZThere the intercellular spaces are large, and into them there project numerous peg-
Alike outgrowths from the walls of the adjoining cells (fig. 40) ; these are similar to
Sthose already well known as existing in the parenchyma at the base of the leaf in
many ferns.
