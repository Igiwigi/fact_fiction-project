The cause of the difficulty is to be found in the fact
that now the stationary value may be expected to arise from values of n for which « is small. Then n is
nearly equal to z, and in all such cases more complicated analysis is inevitable. In fact the approximations
to S, (2) and E, (2) require to be modified by different formule corresponding to the cases n > 2, <2
and to the cases in which |n —2| is of order 2/s or of lower order. SCATTERING OF PLANE ELECTRIC WAVES BY SPHERES. 199

Let us now consider the problem of waves incident from some source (or sources)
and reflected from the surface 8. Let « denote any Cartesian component of force in
the incident wave, and let the point P be outside 8S, Then (7°1) applies, and so

because u has no singularity inside 8,
If u’ denotes the corresponding component of force in the reflected wave, we have
from (7°12)

{(w 2 -—v a) dS = 4rw’p,

because wv’ has no singularity outside S (and wu’ will correspond to a divergent wave
at infinity).
