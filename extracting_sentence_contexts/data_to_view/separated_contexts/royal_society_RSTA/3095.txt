Hence, for all y € (A/2,A),
a A-y rA-y
hah, < Tly=ly + (=) ly Sly + Slyjo-yyo-y Sly + h-y-

If y € (0,A/2), repeat the steps above with replacing y with 4 — y. a

By concentration compactness, there is a subsequence {ug, a

such that u;,(- — yj) > uo in L’, for some tg € H1(R2). We will show first that yy is a bounded
sequence. In fact, we have the following.

and a sequence Ua CR,

Lemma 2.3. The sequence {y;} C R? is bounded. Proof.
