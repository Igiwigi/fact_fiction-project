Thus, free-space macroscopic (many
wavelengths in size) omnidirectional broadband cloaking for light waves is not compatible with
the laws of physics, i.e. it is ‘impossible’. Unfortunately, such an ideal cloak is what is expected
when reading about invisibility cloaking in the media. Even for monochromatic operation, causality (the fact that we cannot change the past) imposes
serious constraints for passive materials. To bring the phase velocity above the vacuum speed of
light (< Re(1) < 1), one needs resonances. Even far away from the resonance, the real part of the
refractive index is accompanied by a finite imaginary part, ie. by losses.
