The difference between these means was found by the ¢ test not to be statistically
significant, the probability of this difference occurring by chance being between
1:10 and 1:20. The figures are suggestive, but not conclusive.

Although the difference is not significant, we can examine data collected for
puparia of both species kept in cages under fluctuating conditions of temperature.
It cannot be regarded as conclusively proved that adults at a high temperature
produce lighter puparia, but the following facts are available. Puparia of Glossina
submorsitans were bred from adults in an incubator at 30°C, and in cages with
monthly mean temperatures fluctuating between 24° and 28°C. At 30°C, 35
puparia had a mean weight of 21-2 mg, and at the lower temperature 237 puparia
had a mean of 23-5 mg. The following monthly mean weights of tachinoides
puparia bred in cages are compared with the approximate mean temperature

mean max. -+ mean min, : -
(mean max. oean mit) of the cages in the previous month.
