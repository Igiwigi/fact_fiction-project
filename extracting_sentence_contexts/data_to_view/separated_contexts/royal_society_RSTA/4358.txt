There is also evidence, from other sources, that new palla-
dium foil possesses a lower absorption power for hydrogen. For example, a portion
of new palladium foil, examined by Granam (‘ Researches,’ p. 268), and believed to
be from fused metal, occluded only 68 volumes of hydrogen. This is ascribed by
Granam to the fact that the metal had been fused. “ An inferior absorbing power
for hydrogen appears to be connected in both platinum and palladium with the
fusion of the metal.” Granawm's explanation is quite consistent with the view here
put forward, for the fusion of the metal would simply produce (only, perhaps, in a
more perfect way) the same effect as a thorough welding or rolling,

The foil examined by us had not been fused, but it persistently refused to occlude
hydrogen in any quantity.
