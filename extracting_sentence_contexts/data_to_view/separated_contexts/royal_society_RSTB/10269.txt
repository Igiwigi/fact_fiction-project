Although conceptually they perform similar functions,
S. aureus cos and pac phages use different proteins for capsid
formation and DNA packaging. Thus, we wanted to test

In silico analysis of Ccm revealed that this protein has a HK97 blocked by the Ccm protein. This was not the case, and

In fact, Cem and the 12 CP seem to be distantly related, either 611 or 80a reproduction (electronic supplementary
