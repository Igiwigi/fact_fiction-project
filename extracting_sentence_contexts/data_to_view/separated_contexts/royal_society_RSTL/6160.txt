J. W. FLowzr succeeded, after some search, in disinterring with
his own hands a fine and large flint-implement at a depth of 22 feet from the original surface of the ground,
â€”an important and conclusive fact to which we all bore witness. An account of this discoyery has been
communicated to the Geological Society. (Quart. Journ, yol. xvi. p. 190.)

Shortly afterwards Sir OnanLEs LYELL visited the pits, and expressed an opinion confirmative of the
antiquity of the flints at the Meeting of the British Ass0ciation at Aberdeen (see Report of the Pro-
ceedings).
