This salt, exposed to a temperature of 280? in an oil bath, loses 4:5 of water or two
equivalents, and hence when dry is C,z H;, NO,, + 2 Su O,.

The blanching of azolitmine by hydrogen can easily be effected by precisely the
same means as were described under lencorceine, but the restoration of the colour
occurs $0 rapidly and from such slight access of air, that it must be considered as
$till more difficult to isolate the white condition than the orceine. I consequently
was not able to analyse the leucazolitmate of zinc, and the proofs of its being
similar in constitution to leucorceine must rest, on analogy alone.

An additional reason for looking on these bodies as being produced by the addition
of hydrogen and not by the abstraction of oxygen, is the fact, that where there are £0
many formed by the absorption of oxygen from the same source, the subsequent re-
moval of oxygen should regenerate the bodies lower in the scale, in place of produ-
