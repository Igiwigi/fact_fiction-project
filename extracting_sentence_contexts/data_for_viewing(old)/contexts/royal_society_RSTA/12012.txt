This appears to be the more general form of a result given by Professor Enceworrs, ‘Roy. Soc.
Proc.,’ vol. 56, p. 271.

For the normal curve ji; = 0, 4, = 81,7; hence, if p does not differ much from q; By and B, — 3 will
be small, and we may neglect their products with «/ Vn. ° Thus approximately

This agrees with Professor Hognworrn’s special case if we expand the second exponential. His
“negative frequency” is accounted for by the fact that he has only taken the first terms of a long

series, i.e.,

T have not considered this form of the skew-curve at length, because it is only a first approximation to
the more general forms considered in this paper, and further, because it is only applicable in practice
within extremely narrow limits.
