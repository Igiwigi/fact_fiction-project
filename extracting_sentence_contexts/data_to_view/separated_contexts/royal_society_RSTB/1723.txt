5 and 6 is gone through in about one internode. â€˜This is confirmed
by the fact that the bundles shown in those two figures, both of which belong to the
same transverse section,* are separated by a divergence of 2. In the series C.N. 1198-1191 only four cortical traces are present in each transverse
section of the internode, because one trace has passed out at the bottom of the series
and is not replaced until the next node is reached, More usually five such traces
are seen in any transverse section of an internode, as shown in photograph 1 and

The following conclusions may be drawn from the facts brought forward, which are
supported by confirmatory evidence from numerous specimens :

1. The phyllotaxis is spiral, and the divergence (except in very small stems) 2.

2. Asa rule each trace passes through five internodes between entering the pericycle
and bending out into a leaf.
