These vessels are yery small, not averaging more than 0006 in diameter ; but as
.© considerable numbers of them are aggregated to form each bundle, the latter attains
Sto conspicuous dimensions. That they are identical in character with those already
DE noticed as observed in the young leaflets I have no doubt ; but it is also obyious that the
EZ bundles have now become very much enlarged, though no corresponding enlargement
# has taken place in the individual vessels. This increase in the 8ize of the bundles is
E explained by the fact, that whilst in the specimen represented in Plate XLI. fig. 1 the
Elargest leaflets are not more than 055 in diameter, in that under consideration (Plate
EXLII.L fig. 9) they have expanded to more than double that size, or *12. Medullary rays
© also now make their appearance in the ligneous zone ; but as I propose to describe these
S more fully when speaking of the matured stem, I will not dwell upon them now. The
S greater part of the bark has disappeared from this specimen ; all the inner parenchy-
Amatous layer is gone, and most of the prosenchymatous one.
