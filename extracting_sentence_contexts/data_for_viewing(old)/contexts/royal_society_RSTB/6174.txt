lateral nucleus receives fibres from the tectum and the nucleus pretectalis, and is
intimately related to the lateral part of the ventral nucleus. It sends fibres with the
thalamic radiations to the cortex.


CEREBELLUM OF ECHIDNA ACULEATA 61

The nucleus dorso-medialis can only be identified with certainty in the caudal
part of the thalamus, anteriorly it merges with the lateral nucleus. Its relation
to the pars medialis of the ventral nucleus is exactly the same as that of the lateral
nucleus to the pars lateralis. It has clearly arisen from the pars medialis. The
close relation which this nucleus always holds to the trigeminal portion of the
ventral nucleus of the thalamus is emphasized by the fact that some authors have
described it as the end-station for trigeminal fibres. Its fibres pass to the cortex
with those of the pars medialis.

The pulvinar bears the same relation to the dorsal nucleus of the lateral geniculate
body as do the other members of this group to their own parent nuclei. It is a
barely separated portion of the dorsal nucleus of the lateral geniculate body but
receives no optic fibres. Anteriorly it is incompletely defined from the lateral
nucleus by cortico-tectal fibres, fig. 16â€”a typical relation. As in other mammals
the pulvinar receives tectal and pretectal fibres, and the mesencephalic optic root
runs over its surface. Its own radiations pass with those of the two geniculate
bodies to the posterior part of the cortex.
