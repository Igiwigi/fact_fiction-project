When dealing with a number of
tasks that require a distribution of individuals performing
them, ants are represented by a Boolean vector and inter-
actions occur following a threshold function (as in standard
neural nets) but with a state-dependent choice of links. In
other words, in contrast with neurons in solid brains, there
is no predefined weight matrix but a state-dependent one. This is in fact an especially important difference, along with
the fact that the attractors are given by populations of Boo-
lean strings and any ant can end up in one of them. The
fourth model makes a strong attempt to get closer to Hop-
fieldâ€™s picture, but is less realistic in terms of modelling real
case scenarios. In order to achieve that result, the model
requires incorporating chemical mediators along with the
correspondence matrix.
