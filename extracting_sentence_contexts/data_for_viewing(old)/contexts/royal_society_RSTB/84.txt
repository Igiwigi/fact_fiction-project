which it arose is explained in this way.

Outside the albumen there is now a new structure—the shell membrane (Plate 31,
fig. 1, sh.)—which first appears in the lower part of the Fallopian tube. The shell
membrane is of a tough parchment-like consistency, and does not stain with haemato-
xylin or borax carmine. On the outside it has a roughened surface, which in
section (Plate 31, fig. 1, sh.) is seen to be caused by the presence of numerous fine

villi. I have not yet tried to trace the deposition of the shell to any special glands.
From the fact that these villi become longer as the egg increases in size it is clear
that the shell does not thicken at the expense of the albumen layer inside.

iii. In the uterus—The egg, arrived in the uterus, has already received its full
complement of membranes. The albuminous investment and the shell have added
15 mm, to the egg’s diameter. The egg continues to increase in diameter after its
arrival in the uterus, and by the time it has reached a diameter of 65 mm. the albumen
layer has entirely disappeared, and the vitelline membrane thus comes to lie close to
the shell. (Plate 30, figs. 3 and 4.) Meanwhile both shell membrane and vitelline
membrane have again increased in thickness. (Plate 30, fig. 2, sh. and vm.) Another
layer, which stains darkly, present in the ovary after the pro-albumen appeared as the
very delicate line containing granules, already described, lies inside the vitelline
membrane. I look on it as a coagulum formed by reagents from the nutritive fluid
