A fairly strong hypha, several times thicker than the cell-walls in many cases, can be
traced through from the epiderinis to the origin of the young tubercle (figs. 7, 8, 9) ;
the tip of the tubercle is always directed so as to meet this hypha. I had frequently satisfied myself of this fact, before more fortunate preparations
showed the facts explained by figs. 9 and 13, Here, as is seen, the hypha referred
to passes down the cavity of a root-hair, and thence traverses the cortex of the root,
cell by cell, beginning to branch when it enters the mass of tissue which constitutes
the young tubercle. It is more difficult to see the branches in the meristem of the
tubercle, for two chief reasons : the cells are smaller and more numerous, and their walls
are very thin.
