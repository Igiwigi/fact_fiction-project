Furthermore, lead styphnate prepared free from fine dust has practically identical heat
sensitiveness with I.C.I. styphnate; it shows a somewhat greater sensitiveness to percussion,
probably on account of the more uniform crystal size preventing slipping away of material
under the action of a blow (figure 52).

(2) Comparison of measurements of percussion sensitiveness with other sensitiveness
tests on initiators suggest a fairly close parallel with the friction sensitiveness figures obtained
in the absence of grit, ie. when the explosive is rubbed between metal surfaces.

This suggests that an analogous mechanical action is involved in both these tests.

The fact that the sensitiveness neither to grit friction nor to heat follows the same sequence
as percussion suggests that percussion sensitiveness is a specific measure of the susceptibility
to mechanical shock or to a pressure pulse, as distinct from the tendency to detonate due to
the formation of local hot spots.

MoMENTUM AND ENERGY FACTORS IN THE SENSITIVENESS TO PERCUSSION

(a) Calculation of the velocity of the drift

If the velocity of the falling ball of mass M is V before impact and V’ after impact, and
the velocity of the drift of mass m (initially at rest so that v = 0) is v before impact and
v’ after impact and ¢ is the coefficient of restitution, standard theory gives
