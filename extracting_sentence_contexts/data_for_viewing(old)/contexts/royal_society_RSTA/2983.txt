In contrast to our previous STS study of epitaxial SRO/YBCO bilayers, the long-ranged PE
here cannot be attributed to CARE because the magnetic DW widths in LCMO are much larger
than the coherence length in both PCCO and LCMO. For comparison, we note that ZBCPs were
not observed on the SRO/YBCO bilayers, and thus they must have a different origin than the
CARE. Therefore, the superconducting-related features observed on the LCMO, both the gaps and
ZBCPs, can most reasonably be accounted for by the emergence of parallel-spin triplet-pairing
superconductivity at the bilayerâ€™s interfaces, allowing for coexistence of superconductivity and
ferromagnetism near the interface and, consequently, for the long-ranged PE. The appearance
of ZBCPs (figure 6) suggests that the orbital symmetry of the induced order parameter is
anisotropic and sign-changing, of either d-wave or p-wave character, corresponding to an odd
or even dependence on the Matsubara frequency, respectively (although odd-frequency s-wave
order parameter is also possible; see below). We wish to emphasize here that the fact that
ZBCPs were observed also in bilayers comprising PCCO is particularly important, because the
tunnelling spectra measured on the bare PCCO never show such features [13,42]. One can thus
conclude that the observed ZBCP is strictly associated with the triplet-pairing order parameter
and does not just reflect the symmetry of the underlying superconductor. Indeed, Eschrig &
