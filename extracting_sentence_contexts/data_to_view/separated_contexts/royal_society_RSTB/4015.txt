Having thus traced, on the grand totals of species of each type of distribution, the
result of the summing up of the endemic flora, as compared with the other two
sections of which the Ceylon flora is composed, we may go on to show that this result
is not one which simply comes out on the total, but also holds in detail, and is not due
to any such fact as that some one or two families are very rare, and might be regarded
as being driven to the wall. The detailed figures show the results given in Table VI. Looking this over, we see that the whole range of the rarity of the Ceylon endemiecs
is only from 39 to 4°9*, working with not less than 14 species in a group; and in fact
a great proportion even of the families with only a few endemies, which are put
together in the list, also come within these figures. ‘The species common to
Ceylon and South India similarly vary only from 2°0 to 4-0, and if a minimum of 20
species be taken, vary only from 3:0 to 4:0. The species of wide distribution vary
from 1:0 to 4°6, and again if groups of not less than 20 be taken, the variation is only
from 2°2 to 3°8.f The means of these extremes correspond very nearly with the
actual means of the whole summing up. The variation in rarity between the different families or groups of families of Ceylon
endemics is small, and goes to show that no one family has any particular advantage
over another, and that there is no case that can be pointed to as showing that any of

* Ie. they are never so common as the mean rarity (3°5) of the whole flora,
t Le. never so rare as the commonest endemics.
