It is perhaps almost
directly obvious that if the force is due to a uniform electric field F, no change of
electric inertia is produced when F* and higher terms are neglected, as we have
merely to superpose on the former solutions a uniform field with the appropriate
induced electrification on a body moving uniformly. Initially, of course, this
state is produced by the aid of a rapidly damped harmonic train. As a matter of
fact the problems already solved were first worked out for an electric field which was
afterwards annulled with a view to making clear how much of the induced electrifi-
cation was due to the accelerated motion itself. ;

The results established are true without limitation as to the size of the sphere, but,
as will appear, it is only for velocities comparable with that of radiation that the
possibility of experimental discrimination can arise. We are thus at present limited
to experiments on negative electrons, and among researches on the deflexion of such
particles KAUFMANN’s investigations on Becquerel rays rank first in historical order
