fluctuation in the average weight of the boll-contents, and in the ginning out-turn of
the lint, were so small as to be negligible, for this particular site.

The three curves plotted from these data show the changes met in passing
through the series of nine sowing dates, as regards the first picking, the first and
second pickings together, and the final yield of all three pickings. Owing to the
boll-worm effect these curves are not true general expressions, thus, the late sowings
suffered more in proportion than the early ones, so that the curves fall off too steeply
towards the right in the second and third pickings.

It is quite clear that the differences actually recorded between the first five
sowings are so slight as to be covered by the experimental errors of their determina-
tion. This is in spite of the fact that our methods of investigation were as accurate
as we could make them. We think it may be taken as demonstrated that anything
less elaborate than our systematic scatter of five plots of each kind is necessarily
quite useless for comparison of sowings made within this period, and that the
elucidation of such fine shades of difference, even if achieved, would‘have very little
practical significance in agriculture.

We can, however, generalise these curves from our preceding discussions. In the
first place, we have seen that the flowering-curve of March 15 sowing rose a few
hours later than that of its three predecessors (sowings February 22 to March 8).
Therefore we know that—other things being equal—the first picking of March 15
sowing should actually be smaller than that of its predecessors, though to an almost
infinitesimal extent. Similarly, we found that the earliest sowing was inferior to its
