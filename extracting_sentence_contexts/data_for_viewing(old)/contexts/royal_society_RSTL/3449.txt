to continue, and give origin to others in their interior, the resulting substance might
increase to an indefinite amount. May not this be the mode producing the intercel-
lular—that is, the real—substance of cartilage? I am the more disposed to think
this possible, from the fact that in the gill-cartilage of fishes, Scuwanx found the in-
tercellular substance to consist of the closely aggregated walls of cells.

394. Though ignorant of the precise nature of the process by which what were
termed the divisions and subdivisions in the oyum were produced, I showed in my
last memoirF, that it consisted in the origin of cells in cells; and suggested that it
might admit of being extended to explain the increase of other cells. This opinion
has been strengthened by the later observations,—which have enabled me in the pre-
sent paper to communicate particularly the nature of the process,—as well as by the
appearance of various cells incidentally observed. For instance, it has been very
common to find the s0-called epithelium-cells of the oviduct, filled with cells. Several
of the varieties of these, some of them carrying cilia, are represented in Plate XXVIII.
