state cannot be found out through a direct measurement. However, pointer states usually leave
multiple records in the environment. Observers can use these records to find out the (pointer) state
of the system of interest. Observers can afford to destroy photons while reading the evidence—
the existence of multiple copies implies that other observers can access the information about
the system indirectly and independently, and that they will all agree about the outcome. This is,
I believe, how objective existence arises in our quantum world.”

6. Discussion: frequently asked questions

The subject of this paper has a long history. As a result, there are different ways of talking, thinking
and writing about it. It is almost as if different points of view have developed different languages.
As a result, one may find it difficult to understand the ideas, as one often has to learn ‘the other
language’ used to discuss the same problem. This is further complicated by the fact that all of these
languages use essentially the same words, but charged with very different meanings. Concepts
like ‘existence’, ‘reality’ or ‘state’ are good examples.

The aim of this section is to acknowledge this problem and to deal with it to the extent possible
within the framework of a brief guide. We shall do that in a way inspired by the modern approach
to languages (and to travel guides): rather than study vocabulary and grammar, we shall use
‘conversations’ based on a few ‘frequently asked questions’ (FAQs). The hope is that this exercise
will provide the reader with some useful hints of what is meant by certain phrases. This is very
much in the spirit of the ‘travel guide’, where a collection of frequently used expressions is often
included.
