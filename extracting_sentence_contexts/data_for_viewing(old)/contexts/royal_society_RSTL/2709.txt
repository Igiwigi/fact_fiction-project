eireumstances ; and is therefore capable in all instances of detecting its presence, and
consequently its absence als. This arises from there being but one counteracting
power, that of aflinity. If the affinity be stronger in the test than in any other sub-
stance, the effect of all other affinities is destroyed. We possess no such electric test,
because here there may be other counteracting causes beside the power of affinity,
opposing currents, for example. Besides, we know that the properties of electricity
are 80 modified by the powers of life, as greatly to interfere with its relations to our
tests. The electricity of the torpedo and other electric animals does not affect the
common electrometer, yet no one has doubted its identity with the electricity of in-
animate nature.

Although electric tests therefore give evidence of the presence of electricity, we
cannot by their means prove its absence; a fact with which we should not have been
acquainted, were it not, under certain circumstances, possible to prove the presence
of electricity without their aid ; that is, the presence of electricity may under certain
circumstances be proved, where it is not indicated by any of the properties generally
admitted to be peculiar to it.

Suppose it were said, for example, that we cannot admit that electricity is the agent
in the combination of oxygen and carbon, because there is no test by which its pre-
sence can be detected ; the reply of Dr. Faravay, I conceive, would be; we cannot
at present, whatever we may do hereafter, make the electricity employed in effecting
this combination evident to any of our tests ; but I consider its presence as a necessary
inference, because I have adduced facts which prove, either that electricity is the
agent in such combinations, or that nature here deviates from the simplicity observed
