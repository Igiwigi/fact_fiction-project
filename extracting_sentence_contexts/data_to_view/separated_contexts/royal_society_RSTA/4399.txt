A similar : a
response is seen in each membrane analysed in this study. The greater rejection of CI” than Nat ia
in prisitine CNTs has been described previously [21,23] and occurs due to a greater barrier for Cl~ : =
entry. This larger barrier is due to the fact that more of the solvation shell must be removed from : =I
the larger Cl” ion compared to the smaller Nat ion in order to enter the pore [21]. : s

The greater salt rejection at low pressures can be explained by considering the free energy 1S

profile of an ion and a water molecule travelling through the membrane. We have previously
shown that the origin of salt rejection in narrow pristine nanotubes originates from the energetic
cost of fully or partially dehydrating the ions as required for the solvated ions to enter the narrow
pores [17,21,30,31]. Similar dehydration barriers exist for water moving from bulk into the narrow
pores as there can be a loss or rearrangement of hydrogen bonds.
