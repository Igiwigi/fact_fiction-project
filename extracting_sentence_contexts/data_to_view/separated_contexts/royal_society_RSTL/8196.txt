T found, on the other hand, that in the silver-copper standards an increase of a 1000th
part in the silyer carried the lines up, while a similar increase in the copper brought
them down in the field of view, 4. e. reduced the height of the vapour from the pole. After registering these facts, I saw at once that all the phenomena might be explained
by assuming a change of volatility ; by assuming, in fact, that alloys differing a 1000th
part are different physical things, and that the spark acts upon the alloy as a whole as
well as upon each vapour separately. Thus in the cases referred to, in which copper is common to both, we find the
melting-points to be as follows :â€”

Gold . . . 1200?
