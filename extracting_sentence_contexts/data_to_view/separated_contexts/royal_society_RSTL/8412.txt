The pith bar commences to oscillate to and
fro, the swing gradually increasing in amplitude until the dead centre is passed over,
and then several complete reyolutions are made. The torsion of the snspending fibre
now offers resistance to the revolutions, and the index commences to turn in the oppo-
site direction. This movement is kept up with great energy and regularity as long as
the candle burnsâ€”producing, in fact, perpetual motion, provided only the radiation
falling on the pith be perpetual *. If the candle is brought closer to the bulb, the
rotation of the pith becomes more rapid; if it is moved further away the pith ceases
to pass the dead centre, and at a still further distance the index sets equatorially. 'The
explanation of the different movements of the pith index according to the distance the
radiant body is off, is not difficult on the supposition that the movement is due to the
direct impact of waves on the s8uspended body.
