2 places, and with slight injuries of the membrane of the hell, were exposed to cold,
they lost heat and froze just as those did which might be reputed dead. Thus, then,
mechanical injuries, such as could not have affected the chemical composition of the
fresh egg, and such as did not prevent its development in incubation, were found
sufficient to deprive it of its power of resisting freezing; and thus its power of resist-
ance appeared to be due, not to any vital principle, but to some peculiarity of me-

chanical construction.

It may be very diflicult to prove what this peculiarity of construction is. That it
is a property of the albumen was proved by some experiments, in which albumen,
gently removed from fresh eggs, exhibited the same mode of freezing as the entire
fresh eggs did: and the following facts, as well as those already mentioned, are
favourable to the opinion, that the property which enables fresh albumen to descend
far below 32* without freezing, is its peculiar tenacity or viscidity, by means of
which the water combined with it is held s0 steadily, that the agitation favourable,
or even necessary, to the freezing at or near 32* cannot take place.

1. The decay and putrefaction of an egg, the freezing and again thawing of one,
and (as egg-preservers well know) the stirring and frequent concussion all tend to
diminish the viscidity of the albumen to such a degree, that, instead of forming a
consistent substance, the greater part of it will flow like a thin liquid from an aper-
ture in the egg-shell.

2. The albumen of eggs does not freeze like a dense s0Jution of albumen, or of
