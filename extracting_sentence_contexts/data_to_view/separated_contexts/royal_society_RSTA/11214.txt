+ (l—m) 5 — (yt+2s 0=0. The system is a complete system; hence it possesses four functionally independent
solutions. Writing

9 = gin — 89112 + 3922 — Je22»
these four solutions can be expressed in the form
z,e+y,
L—m— (y+ 2)(9n — 2912 + G22) — N+ Io»

and another involving v, which would require either the arbitrary constant or the
arbitrary functional form to which the third would be equated. (The fourth is, in fact,
a primitive of the compatible equation under discussion, though it is not necessarily
the common primitive of the three simultaneous equations.) We thus infer that

L—m— (y +2) (gn — 2912 + 922) — $+ In = W (w+ 4,2)

is an intermediary of the second of the equations. DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND ORDER. 47

In a similar manner, by writing

¢=fin — She t sa — Saw
it can be shown that

t—n—(y +2) (f~ur-%z t+ Sa) Ath=x@+2,y)

is an intermediary of the third of the equations. When the conditions of coexistence
of these two are assigned, they determine the arbitrary functions w and y in the
forms
w=—-fAth X=—-AtH:
so that we have
L—m= (y+ 2) (Qu — 2M + 92) $1 - IP -—At+h
b—n=(yt+2) (fi - Rothe) + A-A-nts

and the primitive can be obtained by the customary process, leading to the form
v= Ft Wty t)(A-Atn— %)

where f= (w + y, 2) and g = g (w+ 2, y) are arbitrary functions.
