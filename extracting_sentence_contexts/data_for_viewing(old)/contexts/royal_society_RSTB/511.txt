though without any supply of nitrogen from without. In the third experiment, where
besides the potash manure some nitrogen was applied, in the early years as ammonium

salts and in the later as sodium nitrate, there is some, but comparatively little increase
in the amount of nitrogen in the crop.

Tn connection with the fact of the gradual decline in yield, it should be explained
that owing to failure of the beans there wasâ€”in the second period one year of fallow,
and one year of wheat; in the third period, one year of fallow; whilst in the fourth
period, the first crop failed, and the land was left fallow during the second, third, and
sixth seasons. The yields of nitrogen are, however, in each case, averaged for the
period of 8 years.

After the 32nd year, 1878, the land was left fallow for between four and five years.
Under these circumstances, as will be seen presently, the stock of total nitrogen in the
surface soil had become very low, direct determinations of the nitrogen as nitric acid
showed that the already existing amount of nitric-nitrogen down to the depth of
72 inches, was extremely small, whilst after several years of fallow there would be a
minimum amount of crop-residue remaining for nitrification.
