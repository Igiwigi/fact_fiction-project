In previous sections, we have dis-
cussed several approximations involving monitoring
biodiversity and potential WS. In this section, we will briefly
review recent proposals associated with different ways of
approaching ecosystem degradation and biodiversity losses
under an intervention/engineering view. For each level, differ-
ent mathematical and computational models are required
(figure 2, using drylands as case study) and the presence of
emergent properties is highlighted by the fact that to move
from one level to another, new key components need to be
