of Salisburia, that the suppression of one in Trigonocarpon, or its representation by the
middle coat (which certainly appears to have been much indurated), is a consideration
of comparatively little moment, whilst the resemblance between the structures which
we have described in the two genera is very remarkable.

The supposed alliance of Trigonocarpon with Conifere does not, however, rest on
the above comparison alone, but to a certain extent upon collateral evidence: thus,
the'presence of wood, closely resembling what is supposed to be typical of Conifer,
is abundant in the carboniferous formation ; while the absence of cones and of foliage
similar to that of those Conifere of the present day, whose seeds are similarly
arranged, renders it probable that the drupe-bearing division of the Order, which is
now chiefly prevalent in the Southern hemisphere, predominated in the carboniferous
era. The remarkable fact too, of the resemblance of Noggerathia leaves (a carboni-
ferous genus) to that of Salisburia, was long ago indicated by LivpLey and HvuTrox ;
and though adduced by BroxcNlarT in favour of Trigonocarpon (which is some-
times found associated with these leaves) being allied to Cycadec, accords better
with the assumption of both being coniferous.

'The association of Trigonocarpon, in the nodules we have examined, unfortunately
offers no clue to their affinities, as we find neither cycadeous nor coniferous wood
along with them ; while of plants belonging to or allied to Filices and Lycopodiacee
we find abundant remains in close proximity with the Trigonocarpons, but in the
latter there are no traces of the tissues 80 prevalent in these plants. It is further to
be remarked, in connection with these plants, that Salisburia fruit not only presents
no trace of coniferous tissues, but abounds in scalariform annular and subspiral
