234 MR. NEWPORT ON THE IMPREGNATION OF THE OVUM IN THE AMPHIBIA

a subsequent part of the same communication, these considerations are further
referred to, as being those alone on which the transmission of structural peculiarities
seemed likely to be explained®*.

Recent observation has now supplied to me a fact which renders these considera-
tions, which heretofore were regarded as hypothetical, much more probable; but, at
the same time, it necessitates a revision of the view that an impregnating influence is
transmitted from the surface to the interior of the egg; and also some. correction of
the deductions from experiment by which this view seemed to be supported.

The fact referred to, is, that the spermatozoon of the Frog penetrates bodily into
the substance of the thick envelopes of the egg, and comes into direct communication
with, at least, the membrane which incloses the yelk in the interior.

It is my duty, therefore, to Science, and to the Royal Society, knowing this to be
the case, to revise and to extend my views, and to submit them again to the Society
in their amended form ; making, in self-correction, the certainty of fact now take the
place of negative observation.

In doing this, I shall endeavour to show, that, although still regarding the sperma-
tozoon, for reasons to be adduced, as the organ of a special condition of force, or
vitality in the male body,—its influence on the egg in fecundation is direct and
immediate, and not operative, as heretofore supposed, merely through the envelopes;
