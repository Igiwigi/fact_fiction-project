functional Fo captures this effect, by keeping (only) the energy due to radial stretching and our :
estimate for the cost of wrinkling

Here, v is a real-valued function of one variable (r = |x|), constrained by the boundary condition
(0) =0. We shall show that minimization of this one-dimensional variational problem provides
a good estimate for the radial deformation of the sheet. In addition, it provides a lot of information
about the length scale of the wrinkling at radius r (via the analysis that led to W,¢)).

Assuming that the sheet actually wrinkles (i.e. assuming that the excess length of the outer
circles is large enough to induce wrinkling rather than compression), the cost of changing the
length scale of wrinkling from circle to circle does not enter the leading-order energy; rather,
it contributes to the principal correction (the excess energy). As we are interested in how
the wrinkling pattern changes with 1, it is crucial to understand the principal correction. In fact,
it seems to be of order h (more precisely: we have a lower bound that is linear in h, and an upper
bound that is almost linear in /).

Our main mathematical result is the following characterization of the leading-order energy
and the principal correction.

Theorem 2.1. Assume a; € (0,2~°(ro/R)*), and let € be the excess energy, defined by
:= inf E, — mi v).
c= inf n(u, €) anin, Fo(®)

Then there exist constants hg > 0, co > 0 and cy < 00, all depending on as,r9 and R, such that for any
h € (0,ho) the excess energy € satisfies
