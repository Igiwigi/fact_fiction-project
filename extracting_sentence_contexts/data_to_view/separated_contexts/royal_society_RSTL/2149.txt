144 Dr. HAYGARTH's Ob/ervations on the

Dr. PRICE, in his excellent obſcrvations on annuities,
has adduced numerous facts to prove that women live *
longer than men. | Theſe tables afford many confirma- |
tions of the remark. There died this year, under 20
years old 162 males and x 49 females, that 1s, a majority k
of 13 males; 52 huſbands and 50 wives, that is two :
more huſbands; 28 widowers and 48 widows, which is |
only a majority of 20 widows; though by the general
ſurvey, Table v. there are in Cheſter 258 widowers and
736 widows, or near three times the number. The total
of males is 6697, of females 8016, hence there is 1319
or nearly a fifth majority of females: it may not be im-
proper alſo to obſerve, that the women, eſpecially in the
higher and middle ranks of ſociety, are remarkably
beautiful.
