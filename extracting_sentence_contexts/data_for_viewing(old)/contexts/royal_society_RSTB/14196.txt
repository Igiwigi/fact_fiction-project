any NDVI value for a contested quadrat is likely to be either
relatively high, intermediate or low for both groups. If one
group lives in a home range of on-average high plant pro-
ductivity, the NDVI value of a contested location relative to
the rest of the home range will invariably be lower than the rela-
tive NDVI value for the opposing group that lives in a home
range of on-average low plant productivity. Thus, while the
analysis yielded a significant result and asymmetries in the
value of a contested resource should indeed affect winning
probabilities [84], a larger dataset is needed to draw stronger
conclusions regarding the importance of resource value asym-
metries to BGC outcomes in vervet monkeys. This conclusion is
further strengthened by the fact that only current NDVI
affected the outcome of contests, while only mean annual
NDVI affected the likelihood of BGCs in the first place,
which creates a mismatch regarding the role of immediate
versus long-term benefits of locations that is difficult to explain.

Ethics. All individuals belonging to all the groups observed in the pre-
sent research were habituated to human presence and there was no
direct human-monkey interaction during the course of the behav-
ioural observations. This research adhered to the ‘Guidelines for
the use of animals in research’ of the Association for Study of
Animal Behaviour [85]. The relevant local authority, Ezemvelo
