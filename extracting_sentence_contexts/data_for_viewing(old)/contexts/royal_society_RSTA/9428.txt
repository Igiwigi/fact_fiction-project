CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATION TO PROBLEMS IN HYDRODYNAMICS. 451

It must be remembered, however, that this transformation has been constructed
solely with a view to the angular configuration, and that it affords no guarantee that
the stream-lines corresponding respectively to w > c¢ and w <—c will not be merely
parallel instead of being in the same straight line.

There is, in fact, the possibility of a configuration of the character indicated in
fig. 4, and it must now be shown that this possibility can be provided against by a
suitable adjustment of the parameter /.

16. Significance of the Early Terms in the Expansion of w for Great Values
of z.—If in a transformation such as that of formula (29) the variable w be supposed
to have its modulus large, and an expansion be made in ascending negative powers
of w, the result is a formula of the type

dz = V- {1+Sw3+VDw-"} dw, 2... 2 ees (80)

where negative powers of w beyond the second are neglected, and 8 and D are
constants.
