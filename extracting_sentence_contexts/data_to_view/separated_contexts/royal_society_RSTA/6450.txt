Hence for the
induced currents we have, by (91),

The system of currents is stationary in space, but is displaced relatively to the Sell

according to the speed of rotation. The maximum value of this is 7/2s for a suffi- |
ciently rapid rotation, ‘

* This represents a fictitious distribution of currents

which would give at all points of the disk the
same normal force as the actual field. PROFESSOR H. LAMB ON ELLIPSOIDAL CURRENT-SHEETS, 159

The most important type of induced currents is got by putting n = 2, s = 1, in (95).
