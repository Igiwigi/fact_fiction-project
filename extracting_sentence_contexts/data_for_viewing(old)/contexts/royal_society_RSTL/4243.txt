knowledge must be the accurate study of the chemical nature of those substances
which are thus produced.

But little progress however has been made in this inquiry. I may sum up in a
few words those results already known which, by my own experiments, I am able to
confirm as true. It has been ascertained that wax is separable by alcohol into two
portions, which have been called cerin and myricin ; that, by the action of potash
upon wax, an acid or acids may be obtained, and also an unsaponifiable hody, cerain ;
and that by the distillation of wax we obtain volatile oils, solid hydrocarbon, and an
acid which has been surmised to be margaric acid, from its resemblance to that
substance.

I say that these are the ascertained facts. The high atomic weight of these bodies,
and the unavoidable errors of analysis, have rendered it easy to find formulze for
them, and to speculate as to their nature. If, however, the views which, in the fol-

and constitution have been undiscovered.

It would be useless, and it is by no means my intention, to comment upon all the
