arteries (w), through which the blood is transmitted to the sides of the segments. The reason for this imperfect structure of the valves may perhaps be explained by the
fact that the blood is distributed from the heart in the Scorpion in opposite directions,
partly backwards to the tail, but chiefly forwards and outwards to the head and sides,
as in the Myriapoda, and hence it may be necesary that a reflux of the blood should
not be entirely prevented, as may be required in those instances in which the whole
current is in one direction. This also may be the reason for the valves being formed
more transversely, and less completely than in insects. The structure of the organ is
exceeding thick, opake, and muscular.
