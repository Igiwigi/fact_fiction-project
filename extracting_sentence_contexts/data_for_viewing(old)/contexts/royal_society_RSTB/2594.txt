to some extent spirally. The same is true, in a less degree, of the closely packed
centres of calcification in the Goniastrea septum.

Transverse Sections through the Septal Spiniform Teeth.

As a glance at the septum of Mussa (fig. 15) shows, it is impossible to make a
transverse section through a complete septum, cutting all the spiniform teeth perpen-
dicularly to their axes of length, since such a section would represent a curve nearly
parallel to the margin of the septum. This fact must be remembered in the considera-
tion of the accompanying transverse sections. The thick part of one spiniform tooth
of a septum has been selected for fig. 19, as the axes of the fascicle pairs in the
median plane are there met almost perpendicularly, and thus show the regularity of
their distance from one another—the cross-diameter of a fascicle is about ‘08 millim,
The continuation of this transverse section to the interdental part on both sides is not
included in the figure ; it naturally shows the fascicles more and more obliquely cut.
The lateral parts in fig. 19, marked “gr” represent the emergent ends of fibres belong-
ing to surface granulations. The granulations are particularly large on the thickest
part of the ridge ; the section has cut obliquely across the septum.

On the other hand the granulations are much smaller at the thin ends of the
individual teeth or ridges, and a section which is fairly thick may cut through several
