The new phases have
different symmetry properties that depend on the nature of the pairing interaction. In single-
component d-wave film spontaneous currents appear, breaking the time-reversal symmetry. The
currents are generated due to the fact that the bound states can lower their energy in the presence
of a superflow. In superfluid, the 9He multi-component nature of the condensate results in
the amplitude modulation of the OP in the plane of the film, breaking continuous translation
symmetry. Recent experimental progress in manufacturing of nanometer-scale cells promise a new
window into extreme regimes of confinement, and a new approach to investigation of properties
of surface bound states and unconventional condensates.
