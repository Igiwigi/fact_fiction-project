of revolution, composed of isotropic, incompressible, gravitating material, while no
account is taken of the surface waters. for further simplification we have also sup-
posed that the figure conforms to that required for hydrostatic equilibrium, so that
when the body is undisturbed we may suppose it free from strain in its interior. We
have reason to suppose that this condition is approximately realized in the case of the
Earth. ;

In §§ 1-2, I have obtained. the rigorous dynamical equations for the oscillations of
such a system. The form of these equations is, however, such as to render an
approximate solution necessary. Hence it has been assumed in the subsequent
sections that the ellipticity of the spheroid and, consequently, the angular velocity
of rotation, are small quantities. This assumption leads to a considerable reduction
in the differential equations which express the elastic displacements, and, in fact,
reduces them to the familiar equations for the equilibrium of a strained elastic body
The boundary conditions are also similar in form to the surface equations which are
obtained in treating of the problem of the deformations of an elastic sphere, and as
the solution of this problem is well known, we are in a position to obtain a solution of
our differential equations applicable to the problem in hand. §§ 3-4 are devoted to
the transformation of the equations into a form convenient for solution, while the
actual solution is given in § 5.

The method of approximation followed up to this point fails to lead to a determi-
nation of the period. When, however, the body is supposed perfectly rigid, we are
able to determine the period accurately by means of the equations of angular
momentum for the whole system. This suggests the use of an analogous process,
