Cultural learning is
particularly important for human children. Children are
especially sensitive to information they obtain from others,
both in their everyday observation and imitation of actions
and in learning from testimony (for reviews, see [59,60]). Moreover, children do all this learning in spite of the fact
that they lack many of the kinds of intelligence that are
characteristic of adults. Young children are noisy, variable,
unfocused, unpredictable and impulsive. They lack ‘executive
function’ abilities and capacities for focused and directed
attention and are notoriously bad at long-term planning
and deferred gratification [61,62].
