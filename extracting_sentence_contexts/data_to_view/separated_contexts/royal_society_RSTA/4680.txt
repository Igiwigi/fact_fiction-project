The reading of the thermometer at 0° C. was
0:00° C., and the correction to be applied to the fundamental interval was —0:03° C,
The correction to be applied at 17° C. is consequently quite negligible.

(4) A correction for the reduction of the readings of the above mercury ther-
mometer to the absolute scale. The correction is subtractive, and amounts to 2°2 parts
in 10,000 on the specific heat. (5) A correction for the fact that the volume of the reservoir was altered by the
external pressure of the water in the bath which surrounded it. The corrections for
internal pressure were taken into account when working out the results for the
calibration of the tubes, but the above correction was left to be applied to the
calculated value of the specific heat. It is dealt with fully in the records preserved
in the archives, and is shown to be additive and to amount to 2 parts in 10,000.
