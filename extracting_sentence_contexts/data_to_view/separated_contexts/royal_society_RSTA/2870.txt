+ Also in the case of a gas whose molecules are point centres of force which aftract one another
according to the fifth-power law. This case, among others, is considered in Part II., and probably is
nearer to actual fact than MAXWELL’s case.—Note added October, 1911. CONSTITUTED OF SPHERICALLY SYMMETRICAL MOLECULES. 441

which we shall denote by fi,’ When there are slight inequalities of temperature
and mass motion in the gas, we shall suppose that

F=fAtIt+F(U,V,W)}, fe =fo{1+F(U’, Vv’, W)},

where F and F’ are expansible in the form of power series (without the constant
terms) in the variables (U, V, W) and (U’, V’, W’) respectively.
