Â© MR. FAIRBAIRN ON THE RESISTANCE OF TUBES TO COLLAPSE. 401

one, the loss being much greater in the former than in the latter case, although the
ratio of the diameters is about the same. Allowance must, however, be made for inac-
curacies of construction, though we might reasonably have expected a nearer approxima-
tion in the ratios of the deficiency of strength. From these facts, however, it is obvious
that in every construction, where tubes have to sustain a uniform external Pressure,
the cylindrical is the only form to be relied upon, and any departure from it is attended
| with danger.
Resistance of Tubes to Internal Pressure.

During the investigation on the comparative resisting powers of tubes to collapse, a
question arose as to the relative powers of cylindrical tubes to resist an internal force
S acting uniformly over their surface. Tt has already been demonstrated that the resist-
& ance of cylindrical vessels to internal pressure varies inversely as the diameters, but what
= effect the length may have upon the strength has yet to be determined. We have
S already seen that a cylindrical tube, when subjected to external pressure, loses one-half
E its strength when the length is doubled, and 80 on in other cases; hence arose the inquiry,
