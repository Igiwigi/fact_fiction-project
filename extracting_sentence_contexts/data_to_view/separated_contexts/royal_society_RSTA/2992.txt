It is simple enough to repeat the above reasoning for theorem 1.1, where
we no longer make use of locality. In this case, we may still use figure 4 provided we ignore the
no-communication decomposition structure. In particular, strong subadditivity yields

I(R’ : R) < I(B’,N',R': R) = (B,N,1:R) =I(B,N: R). (A 15)

Here, we use the fact that joint subsystems (B’, N’, R’) and (B, N, I) are unitarily related. Again, the
most natural assumption is that the infallen matter I is independent of the quantum state of the
black hole, (B, N), or its early epoch radiation R. Applying equation (A13) to any PT then tells us that for a unitarily and completely
evaporating black hole
1(B,N:R) > (1 —)SpH — Smatterr € <1. (A 16)

To simplify our argument, we shall suppose that the infallen matter (Jearly,[) has actually
entered the black hole.
