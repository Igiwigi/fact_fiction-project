The papers of DELAGE (17, 18) on

rearing parthenogenetic larye of 4. glacialis should also be referred to here. Although not primarily
dealing with form and structure, they provide some useful data regarding the appearance and habits of
the larva at different stages, and mention the shrinkage and absorption of the preoral lobe, and the fact
of fixation at metamorphosis. Processes.â€”The growth of the bipinnaria, and its change to the brachiolaria, as
well as the gradual development and final proportions of the ciliated processes,
brachia and sucker will be followed from the illustrations on Plates 18-20, par-
ticularly from figs. 5-11.
