'= No. 6. Thirty-sir eggs were passed from a Frog, which had been killed about
& three-quarters of an hour, and some fluid which had been obtained and mixed with

= water forty;four hours before was shed over them, and pure water was then added.
S The envelopes of these eggs became expanded as under perfectly healthy and

i= favourable conditions ; but within two hours of the contact of the eggs with the fluid
= the yelks of the whole became very irregular, sbrivelled, and contracted, and assumed
an appearance very similar to that which first results from the application of a strong
D Solution of potass. Not one egg retained its spherical shape, but the whole entirely
S perished; and it may be needless to add, not an embryo was produced.

S These facts then support the statement already made, that only while the sperma-
S tozoon continues to give evidence of vitality in its power of motion does it exert any
= fecundatory influence on the egg. They seem, too, to show that the period during
= which this vital force is retained by the mature spermatozoon after it is passed from
S the body of the Frog is perhaps shorter even than what I have stated, and that the
â€” limit, in regard to time, depends much on physical influences. In addition to this,
3 they seem to Show that after all ocular evidence of power in the spermatozoon is
5 lost, this body is inert, until decomposition has commenced, when its material con-
S 8tituents become injurious and destructive.

The following experiments have more direct reference to the vitality of the egg.
and appear to indicate that this is much longer retained than that of the spermato-
zoon, and is less quickly affected by external causes.
