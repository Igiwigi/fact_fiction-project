segmentation of an ovum must be considered to be rather of the nature of a repetition
of phyletic history, than a necessary process in the formation of an embryo.

It is impossible to imagine @ priori any definite use which the complete segmentation
of the ovum can be in the building up of animal tissues.

Every ovum upon fertilisation, or even before, must possess a tendency to pass
through all the stages in the phyletic history of the animal. If it did not possess
this tendency, we should have lost all traces of an animalâ€™s history in its ontogeny.
There would be no gill slits in Mammalian embryos, no pineal gland in Vertebrates.
The science of Embryology would be of little value to us.

We know that this tendency may be overcome, by the fact that many stages in
ancestral history, many organs and structures undoubtedly possessed by ancestors,
disappear. But what causes govern the obscuration or disappearance of these organs,
structures, and stages, we do not, in most cases, know with any degree of certainty.

Turning now to the stages represented in the various phases of segmentation and
the morula.

Most ova with but little yolk completely segment; the tendency to repeat
ancestral types is not interfered with. Most ova with a large amount of food-yolk do
not segment; the tendency to repeat ancestral types is interfered with. ~ The
natural conclusion to come to is, that in such cases this tendency to repeat ancestral
types is interfered with by the food-yolk ; that the delay, which would be occasioned
