As these results refer to a study at present far from complete, it will be sufficient to state
here that the intrinsic brilliancy is about 11,000 candle-power per square centimetre. Inserting this
value for b in the formula given above, we obtain 3830 as the temperature of the crater. This fact may
be taken as a confirmation of the formula for temperatures above the melting point of platinum,
though I do not think that it would be wise to attach much importance to a coincidence of this kind. 8u2
