3In [18, Footnote 1] Poritsky acknowledged that the results in the paper were obtained in 1927-29 while he was National
Research Fellow in Mathematics at Harvard University, presumably under the supervision of Birkhoff. Although the author
does not attribute this conjecture explicitly to Birkhoff, he cites many of his papers on the topic; hence it is reasonable to
surmise Birkhoff’s influence behind it.


Remark 4.2. An integral-geometric approach to prove Bialy’s result was proposed by
Wojtkowski [28], by means of the so-called mirror formula. This approach was later exploited
by Bialy [29] for billiards on the sphere and the hyperbolic plane, as well as for magnetic billiards.

Observe that Bialy and Wojtkowski’s result is not in contrast with what we have discussed
in the case of elliptic billiards. In fact, in that case the family of convex caustics represented by
confocal ellipses do not foliate the whole domain (the segment between the two foci is left out),
and neither set of homotopically non-trivial invariant curves has full @-measure in the phase
space: the homotopically trivial invariant curves corresponding to orbits tangent to confocal
hyperbolae, foliate a positive @-measure set (in the phase portrait (figure 4) this set corresponds to
the area below the separatrix, i.e. the stable/unstable manifold of the hyperbolic 2-periodic orbit
corresponding to the major semi-axis of the ellipse).

What about other notions of integrability? In the study of integrable systems, in fact, in most :23
