from the monthly means of the observations in the several months, from 8:90 to
12'11 at one station, and from 766 to 1063 at another station separated from the
former by nearly half the surface of the globe, might naturally have created an
expectation that they would prove to be independent and corresponding measures of
a general phenomenon. Fortunately, in the case of the diurnal range, we have not
to wait, as we have in the case of the disturbance-progression, for a confirmation of
its extension to Europe. In a recent number of PocG@exporey's Annalen, 1851, No.
12, December 23 (which only reached the author of this paper when the greater
part of it was already written), Dr. Lamoxr has published a Table of the mean
monthly range of the diurnal variation of the Declination at Munich, from 1841 to
1850 inclusive, from which he also has been led to infer the probable existence of a
periodical inequality, having its epoch of minimum in 1843:5, and of maximum in
1848'5, The mean range of the diurnal variation in monthly periods at Munich in
the years discussed in this paper, is stated in Dr. LawonTt's communication to have
been as follows :â€”
