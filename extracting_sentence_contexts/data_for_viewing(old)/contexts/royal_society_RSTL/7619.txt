Action of Chlorine upon Vanadium Triozide —The action of chlorine upon this oxide
led Benzei1Vs to give to it the formula VO, (V=68:5); but, as has already been gtated,
the fact that one-third of the vanadium remains in combination with oxygen in the
residual vanadic acid follows equally from the formula V, O, when V=51'3.

Thus 3(V, 0,)+6 CL,=V, 0, +4V O Cl,.

Two experiments made in order to test the purity of the trioxide prepared by reduc-
tion of vanadiec acid in hydrogen gave the following results:—

(1) 46004 grms. V, O,, treated with dry chlorine, gave a residue of 1:8307 grm. V, O, ;

theoretically it should yield 18597 grm.

(2) 02686 grm. V, O, yielded 0-992 V, O,, instead of 1:0858 grm.
