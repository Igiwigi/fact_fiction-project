The
same figures show another peculiarity of the auricular curves, which is especially
characteristic of the Toad's heart, viz. : after the maximum force of contraction bas been
reached, the contractions gradually diminish to a height less than before the stimulation,
and then again increase up to or lightly beyond their original height : a peculiarity
which I have never as yet observed in the ventricular curves. I have already said sufficient to justify the assertion which I made above, that the
vagus is never absolutely inefficient ; it always produces some effect or other upon
stimulation, and IT have described a variety of the effects which it does produce. Hitherto I have considered the curves as a whole, and have shown that the different
effects seen when the nerve is stimulated—as far at least, as the action of the nerve
upon the force of the contractions is concerned—ean all be arranged in a graduated
Series in which no line of demarcation can be drawn separating one especial effect
from another, Tt remains to be seen whether a similar gradation can be produced



THE FROG, AND ON THE ACTION OF THE VAGUS NERVE. 1011

by a series of stimulations in each separate experiment, and, if 80, what conditions are

necessary for its production.

f Tn the first place, sbimulation of the vagus is much more likely to reduce the force
of the contractions down to complete quiescence immediately after removal of the heart
from the body, than after it has been 8uspended for some time ; and, indeed, a variety
of facts can be brought together which all point in one direction, viz. : that the produc-
tion of quiescence by stimulation of the nerve stands in intimate relation with the
existence of a snitable nutrition of the heart. Thus it frequently happens that typical
inhibition can be obtained before the heart is removed from the body, although after

TD it has been suspended ib is impossible by any strength of stimulation to reduce the

a etrength of the contractions to such an extent as to cause standstill. S Again, experiments made in June for this express purpose show that if the heart be

8uspended as quickly after removal as possible, and the circulation be kept intact till

S the last moment, then, with a certain strength of current the firs stimulation caused

© absolute quiescence ; the next, although of the same strength and length, only a primary

= diminution of the force of the contractions, and with sncceeding stimulations of the

Srame strength and the same length and following upon one another at as nearly as

Z poxsible the same intervals of time, there was a decided tendeney for the primary

= diminution of the contraction force not only to diminish in extent, but also to attect a

smaller number of beats, until at last the stimulation caused an increase in the force of

-2 the contractions with a previous diminution of only one or two or even no beats at all

3 (se Plate 68, fig. 9).

> Indeed, it can be aid that in the course of each separate experiment the snecessive

SE stimulations of the nerve tend to show the same gradation of effects from complete

Zquiescence followed by augmentation on the one hand, up to a simple primary augmenta-

< tion of the force of the contractions on the other, as has already been pointed out

E from the consideration of the whole number of curves.

bj In the second place, the examination of my curves indicates that the nature of the

YZ special nutritive condition of the heart, upon which the phenomenon of vagus standstill

2 depends, may possibly be given by the chemical examination of a large number of

E hearts ab different times of the year, for as far as I can judge from this first series of

A experiments, standstill is more likely to occur upon vagus stimulation, aſter the heart

has been cut out and suspended, in the early spring months of the year than in the
Summer months.
