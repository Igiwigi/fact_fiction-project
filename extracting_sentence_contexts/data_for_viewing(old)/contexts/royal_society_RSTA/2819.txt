mantle results in a thicker crust with different chemical composition, so it is possible to track
the cooling history of the ambient mantle from the chemistry of igneous rocks erupted at
different ages [97] (figure 9a). Such reconstruction of past mantle temperatures indicates the
modern cooling rate of approximately 100K Gyr7!, in good agreement with the geochemistry-
based thermal budget. This agreement forms strong evidence against the notion of self-regulating
mantle convection, and it would be most straightforward to explain the petrology-based cooling
history if convective heat flow is relatively insensitive to mantle temperature (figures 8b and 9b).
Incidentally, this cooling history is at variance with the kind of intermittent plate tectonics
proposed by Silver & Behn [174], regardless of assumed heat flow scaling [175]. The cooling
rate of approximately 100K Gyr™! is also consistent with the secular decrease in oceanic crust
thickness [176] and seems necessary to explain the observed rate of seafloor subsidence [161].
In contrast to the long-held belief in faster convection for a hotter mantle, supporting
geological records have been lacking for decades [177-179]. As a matter of fact, recent studies
suggest that plate motion may have been even slightly slower in the past, based on the lifespan
of passive margins [96] and continental reconstruction [98,99]. Such slower plate motion in the
past is consistent with a constant surface heat flux through time (figure 9b); plate velocity, U and
surface heat flux, Q, are related as Qa AT¥VU, where AT is the temperature contrast between
surface and the interior [180], so when Q is constant, U should decrease as AT increases. It
