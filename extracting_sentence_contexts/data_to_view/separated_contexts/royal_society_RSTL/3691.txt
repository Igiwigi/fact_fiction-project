The bile and the urine have been ever classed together as the most, important
excretions. The former is secreted from venous þlood ; the latter it has been thought
ſrom arterial blood, except in some inferior animals, in which the blood from the
lower part of the body circulates through the kidneys. But it is a most striking fact,
that the proximate principles of the urine, like those of the bile, are secreted in all
animals from blood which has already passed through one system of capillaries,
in a word, from portal blood ; although it does not appear to what extent its qualities
are changed by trayersing the Malpighian system. The analogy is at least remark-
able, and may throw some light on the mysterious meaning of the portal circulation.

2. Diuretic medicines appear to act specially on the Malpighian bodies; and va-
rious foreign substances, particularly salts, which, when introduced into the blood,
pass off by the urine with great freedom, exude in all probability through this bare
system of capillaries.
