three primary electrophysiological components of ischaemia on the susceptibility to conduction
block (in both simple fibres and strongly heterogeneous tissue).

Our emulation also allowed us to generate plausible parameter maps of re-entry risk in
heterogeneous tissue, as well as the likelihoods of successful/blocked propagation in such tissue.
Our results implicate WL as the most critical component of re-entry formulation, given that even
cases with a low frequency of block (and low S) still often exhibited the unidirectional block
event(s) required for re-entry initiation. Only for the lowest ¢ value was a decrease in excitability
seen to clearly increase propensity for re-entry, as this proportion of obstacles was no longer
guaranteed to generate the required block through structural effects. On the other hand, block
susceptibility does directly inform at which point re-entries will fail to develop due to a complete
inability to propagate through the heterogeneous tissue. As such, high amounts of hyperklaemia,
in fact, protect against re-entries situated in regions of heavily damaged tissue.

There are also several limitations to our study, that we address here in detail. Firstly, concerns
of computational feasibility allowed us to only simulate a small number of realizations for each


combination of ischaemia parameters and obstacle proportion ¢. Our use of emulation to predict
further regions of interest in the parameter space partially alleviates this issue, but more robust
conclusions could, of course, be obtained with access to richer data. Variability introduced by
different micro-scale realizations of obstruction is important—for example, our patient-specific
study considering this used 500 biventricular meshes each with their own unique pattern of
obstructions in order to thoroughly examine the effects of structural variability on re-entry
dynamics [30].
