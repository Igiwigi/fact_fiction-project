transitional Amazonian forests [18]. The areal extent of these This may indicate that the 2015-2016 El Nino, which was


one of the strongest in recorded history, produced drought
conditions so severe that necromass moisture content was
reduced across all forest classes to a level that permitted com-
bustion and sustained fires, overriding any pre-existing
microclimatic differences that may have existed owing to
the initial disturbance. This is further corroborated by the
fact that wildfires did not distinguish between largely undis-
turbed forests (mostly inside protected areas) and those that
have been modified by humans (mostly outside protected
areas), burning vast areas of both types of forest (figure 1).

(d) Caveats

Though our dataset is the first to our knowledge that allows
for quantification of necromass carbon stocks pre- and
post-uncontrolled understorey wildfires in human-modified
Amazonian forests, our sample size was limited, with just 18
necromass monitoring plots, of which seven burned during
the 2015-2016 El Nino. Consequently, results that follow
