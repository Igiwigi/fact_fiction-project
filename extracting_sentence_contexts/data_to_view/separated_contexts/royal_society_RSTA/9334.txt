Making all due allowance for the increased
amplitude of the regular diurnal variation in summer, Table IT. shows clearly that
the annual variation of disturbance has a well marked double period, with minima
at midwinter and midsummer, and maxima in March (or late February) and October. The maximum in Spring is the more prominent of the two. Taste Il.—Number of Days not included in “ Ordinary.”

The basis on which the curves were treated was largely determined by the fact
that the D, H and V curves had to be considered at different times. If a careful
consideration of the curves from all three elements had preceded all measurements,
a common selection of ordinary days would probably have been made. As it is,
a little more disturbance enters into the ordinary day H inequality than into that
for V, and a little more into the D inequality than into that for H.
