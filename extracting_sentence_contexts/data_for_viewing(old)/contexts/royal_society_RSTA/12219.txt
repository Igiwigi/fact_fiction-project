long and reads from 95° to 105° C.) indicates a constant temperature, usually 97° or
98° C. When the temperature of the ball has been lowered 6° or 7°, the ice and
water are taken away, and the ball is carefully dried with a soft cloth. The water-
jacket is again placed so as to surround the ball and the cover put on as before, the
circulation of water in the jacket having been started.

It is now only necessary to take readings of both thermometers every half minute.
The temperature of the hot water will be practically constant, but it is advisable
to take the readings in case of alteration. The calorimeter thermometer may be read
till it reaches 20° C.

It will be convenient to explain here the reason for cooling the ball 6° or 7° before
starting. In the preceding remarks no notice was taken of the fact that there will
be radiation to or from the surface of the ball unless the latter is at the same tempe-
ture as its surroundings. It would be impossible to allow for this by calculation, as
the surface is altered before every test by being heated while the wire is being
soldered into the ball. For the purpose of getting rid of the necessity of allowing
for this radiation, the ball is cooled down.

Let Q, = the quantity of heat which flows along the wire in unit time when the
hot end is at T° and the cool end at 6 above the temperature ¢ of the air and water-
nes and let Q, Fe the quantity when the cool end is 6° below that of the air.
