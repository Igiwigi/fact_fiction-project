I believe that this statement is true.

2. That of BivpeR and Scnmpr, FrERICHs, and LEHMANN—that the excretion of urea
results chiefly from excess of food, and represents © luxus consumption,” and has no
necessary relation to tissne action or tissne metamorphosis. This is based upon the fact
that with excess of food, and with certain kinds of food, as gelatine, there is an almost
immediate increase in the elimination of nitrogen ; and this is abundantly supported by
the experiments of Lawzs and GILBERT, and by those recorded in this paper.

3. That of Lupwic and FunurER—that urea is due neither to the immediate changes |.
from food nor to changes from tissue, but to the destruction of blood-cells. This view
is, I think, of little value, since it simply indicates, in a general manner, that the urea
is due to activity of the vital functions.

The first view is in accord with LtepiG's theory of the use of nitrogen, and refers
exsentially to the formation of urea; whilst the second view, regarding the close con-
nexion of excess of food with urea, refers chiefly, or at least in great part, to the elimi-
