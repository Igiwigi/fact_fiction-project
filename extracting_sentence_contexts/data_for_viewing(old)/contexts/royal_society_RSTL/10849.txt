the character of the effect of load when it becomes cyclic depends on the limit to
which loading has been carried. If the total load has been only 1 kilo. (corresponding
to an intensity of stress of 8ay 2'1 kilos, per 8q. mm.), then its application gives
increase and its removal gives decrease of magnetism, when the cyclic state is reached,

But if the load has been 3 kilos., or anything greater (sill nob exceeding the limit
of elasticity), the effect when it becomes cyclic is that on gives fall and off gives rise
of magnetism. This corresponds to the effects shown in fig. 36 for the cycles of load
from 0-3-0 up to 0-9-0.

Now it would seem, from the fact that when 1 kilo. only is applied and removed on
gives rise and off gives fall of magnetism, that there is essentially a maximum of
magnetisation in this annealed wire corresponding to a very small load, and this view
is confirmed by curves taken with vibration, for in these a maximum appears ab or
near 1 kilo. of load. But this maximum does nob appear in eyclic curves given by
applying and removing higher values of the load. Tts absence is, however, satisfac-
torily explainable as one of the effects of hysteresis. Tn fact, it still exists, bub
hysteresis shifts it to the lefb of the origin, &o that successive applications and
removals of pull lie on one side of it. If we could trace the effects of push as well as
pull, the presence of this maximum would be immediately detected. The diagram
below will make my meaning more clear.

Starting from A (a point reached, say, by tapping the annealed wire, when the load
