severity of scientific research. Theseries of numbers representing electro-chemical equi-
valents must, like those expressing the ordinary equivalents of chemically acting bo-
dies, remain subject to the continual correction of experiment and sound reasoning.

845. I give the following brief 'Table of tons and their electro-chemical equiva-
lents, rather as a specimen of a first attempt than as anything that. can supply the
want which must yery quickly be felt, of a full and complete tabular account of this
class of bodies. Looking forward to such a table as of extreme utility (if well con-
structed) in deyeloping the intimate relation of ordinary chemical affinity to elec-
trical actions, and identifying the two, not to the imagination merely, but to the con-
viction of the senses and a sound judgement, I may be allowed to express a hope,
that the endeayour will always be to make it a table of real, and not hypothetical,
electro-chemical equivalents ; for we shall else overrun the facts, and lose all sight
and consciousness of the knowledge lying directly in our path.

846. The equivalent numbers do not profess to be exact, and are taken almost
entirely from the chemical results of other philosophers in whom I could repose
more confidence, as to these points, than in myself.
