From the abundance of these saline molecules in comparatively
80 small a quantity of water, and in s0 confined a space as a glass tube, the water as a
preparatory step to 8olidification is not able to eject the saline molecules; they there-
fore remain and influence the forms of the solid which results from the low tempera-
ture. My business, however, is only incidentally mixed up with the solidification of
supersaturated s0lutions. What I wish to insist on is the fact that, in the absence of a
nucleus, these s0lutions prefer rather to become solid than to crystallize ; and that there
is no real freezing (if by freezing is meant, as a necessary condition, the separation of
8a1t during the act) is proved, I think, by those cases where the result of a moderate
elevation of temperature is to produce a bright, clear, and till highly supersaturated
solution®” ; while in other cases, where there is a separation of salt, it is the anhydrous or
a salt of a lower degree of hydration than that employed to make the solation. But if,
at any time during the process of solidifying or of melting, the solution be s8ubjected to
the action of a nucleus, crystallization is sure to set in, and the original fully hydrated
8alts are reproduced. A s0lution of the eupric and magnesic $ulphates at 4* F. produced the crystals already
described, and when solid the outside of the tube displayed some elegant forms in dif-
ferent shades of blue.
