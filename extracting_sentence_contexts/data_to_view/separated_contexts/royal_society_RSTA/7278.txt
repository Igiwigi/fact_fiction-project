It is measured in (seconds)â€™. In all the whistlers examined in the present work it was confirmed that the quantity /~
increased linearly with time, and in analyses of those whistlers which followed atmospheric
clicks it was found, furthermore, that the intercept of the /~! against / graph on the time axis
always coincided with the time of the click within the limits of experimental error, which

were about | 0-18. The chief sources of error were the high level of interfering atmospheric

noise, and also the fact that the whistlers were by no means pure tones. The spread of their
spectrograms in the frequency direction was much greater than that of a pure gliding tone
with the same rate of variation of frequency.* This spread varied widely from one whistler
to another, tending to increase with increasing dispersion. These points are illustrated by figure 3, which is a typical analysis ofa whistler following
an atmospheric.
