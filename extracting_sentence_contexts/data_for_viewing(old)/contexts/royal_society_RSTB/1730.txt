at the middle of the xylem and one near each end; in larger bundles they were
numerous. The smallest elements were not situated at the periphery of the
xylem, but were imbedded in its mass, nearer the lower than the upper surface. That
the elements in question are really the spiral tracheides or protoxylem is proved by
the longitudinal sections (see Plate 23, fig. 13, px., ef: also C.N. 1982).

We thus see, that the position of the initial strand is essentially the same as in
the bundles of the stem. We desire to call special attention to the fact that there
is not the slightest reason for regarding the. centrifugal or lower portion of the xylem
‘in the leaf * as secondary, which is the view of MM. Berrranp and Renavtr in the
ase of Porexylon. In Lyginodendron this tissue shows no sign of radial seriation
