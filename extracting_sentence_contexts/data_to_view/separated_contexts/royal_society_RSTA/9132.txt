The first of these,
namely, the sliding at the surface of separation, can be
removed by suitably increasing the tensions in the top beam and.the pressures in
the lower beam. The other dislocation, due to the different lateral curvatures, is less
easily disposed of. However, we can observe that when the beam is narrow this second
dislocation, is small, and we shall show, in fact, that it can be neglected in estimating
the flexural rigidity of a narrow beam. In the case of wider beams it will evidently
have a greater effect, and, moreover, its removal should increase the flexural rigidity
of the beam, since that removal is equivalent to adding an additional restraint to the
system. It will be shown later, however, that this increase in the flexural rigidity is
quite small, even in the extreme case when the beam becomes a plate.
