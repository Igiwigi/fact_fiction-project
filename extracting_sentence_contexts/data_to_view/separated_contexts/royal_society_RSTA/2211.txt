The first part is the usual quadratic form described by a matrix which
has Green and Robin functions as its entries. The second part is a quadratic form which gives the
energy of circulating flows beyond those which are already present in the Green function. The
problem is that there is a non-trivial interaction between the two parts of the Hamiltonian, due to
the fact that the electrostatic-type Green function we are working with does not respect the Kelvin
Law. As the poles (vortices) move the global circulations implicit in the Green function change,
and that has to be compensated by the second term in the Hamiltonian. One could imagine replacing the electrostatic Green function by a hydrodynamic Green
function, like in the multiply connected planar case.
