Considering these points, I perceived that if the problem were to be solved in
anything like a satisfactory manner it would be necessary to ascertain, not only
where the youngest larvae were to be found, but also where they were not. Until
a comprehensive survey had been obtained as to the distribution and respective
density of the various sizes of larve in all parts of the sea, it would hardly be
possible to form definite conclusions as to the origin of the eels of our European
continent. The task was thus one of enormous dimensions, albeit with the consolation
that the South Atlantic might be disregarded as being devoid of any repre-
sentative of the genus Anguilla, a fact which I had been able to prove in
my previously mentioned work on the distribution of this genus throughout the
world (1909, loc. cit.). In order to proceed further, then, it was evidently necessary to procure observations
from the greatest possible area of the North Atlantic. As I have already stated, the
“Thor” was useless for such work as this; I had, therefore, to endeavour to procure
the requisite material by other means.
