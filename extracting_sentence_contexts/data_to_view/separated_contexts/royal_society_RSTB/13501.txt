As a result, Agta and
BaYaka social networks exhibit ‘small-world’ features dis-
playing both high clustering and reduced low path length,
which can explain both cultural specialization among close-
knit households, and cultural recombination through
friendship links between households and camps [96].

(g) Network memory promotes cultural complexity
and ratcheting

Human cumulative culture is characterized by a ratchet
effect, whereby cultural traits survive across generations
with relatively little backward slippage and continuous incor-
poration of innovations [7]. Although non-human primates
have provided many examples of long-lasting cultural
traditions, the more complex cultural traits of hunter-
gatherers suggest higher rates of cultural accumulation. The
fact that culture is produced by populations rather than indi-
viduals may explain why ratcheting is more efficient in
humans. For example, a BaYaka population from Congo
demonstrated collective knowledge of 32 medicinal plants,
but no individual knew the whole medicinal repertoire [10]. Therefore, the ratchet effect implies reliance on a collective
memory that distributes cultural knowledge across individ-
uals unable to fully recreate it from scratch.
