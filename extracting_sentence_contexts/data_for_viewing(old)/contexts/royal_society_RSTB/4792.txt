Vieillardi and to discuss their bearing upon the affinities of this plant, both within the
family Psilotacee and with other Pteridophytes. Advantage has been taken of this
opportunity to publish photographs of the different “ forms” of the genus, so as clearly
to illustrate, for what they are worth, the individual differences in habit and
external morphology.

The material on which this paper is based was collected in New Caledonia by Prof. R. H.
Compron, who has recently published a taxonomic account of part of his collections.*
Prof. Compton very kindly entrusted to me the anatomical investigation of his formalin}
specimens of T’mesipteris, and it is with great pleasure that 1 record here my sincere
thanks to him. I also wish to express my gratitude to Prof. A. C. Sewarp, F.R.S., in
whose laboratory the research was originally begun,{ for the interest he showed in the
work during the early stages. Moreover, the fact that he very kindly undertook to
revise the manuscript has now afforded me the benefit of his able criticism and valuable
suggestions, for which also it is a genuine pleasure to me to offer my sincerest thanks
to him.

TAXONOMY.

In the concluding chapter of BERTRAND’s monograph§ there is an admirable critique
of the earlier literature, so that we need not refer to it here. Among the dried
specimens at his disposal Berrranp could recognize only a single species. His des-
cription was based on a specimen from the Blue Mountains, identified as Tm. tannensis
Brrnu., which, as he himself stated (footnote p. 222), closely resembled a specimen from
New Caledonia. 1 may point out here that the plant described by BERTRAND is
