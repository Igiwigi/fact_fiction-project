Gradually the pigment diminishes in the cells, and they may then be said to be sepa-
rable into two portions, one striated longitudinally and transversely, the other granular,
and more or less pigmented, and in this latter portion one or more nuclei are contained. At this stage a distinct membrane may be seen bounding the granular portion, as in Plate
V. fig. 11. I believe that in the cases where the membrane can only be distinguished
on one 8ide of the structure, its apparent absence on the other is only the result of the
position in which the object is seen ; for if the membrane (which is very thin and deli-
cate) lies in close apposition to the striated portion, its separate outline will be quite
undistinguishable ; and I am confirmed in this belief by the fact, that often in the same
preparation, and at stages not much further advanced, cells can be found on which a
membrane can also be seen on the other side of the striated portion (when seen in

profile), and separated from it by a distinct epace which is filled with the wan granular
and pigmentary matter as that which occupies the portion of the cell Which is free
from striation, and which may be seen, on altering the focus, to be diffused, but much
less thickly, over the surface of the striated part ; 80 that, to my own ms, the conclusion
is unavoidable, that the membrane, which can be thus distinctly seen in profile at the
edges of the fibres, encloses a space occupied (1) by one or more nuclei, (2) by a
substance striated both longitudinally and transversely, and (3) by amorphous trans-
parent matter containing suspended in it a varying amount of granules and pigment.
