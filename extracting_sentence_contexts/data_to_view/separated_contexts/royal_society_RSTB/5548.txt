Carbon in Volatile Acids.—Consideration of the figures obtained for all species
for “ carbon in volatile acids ” enables one to make an important biochemical generaliza-
tion. In no case did any species of Penicillium produce more than small yields of
volatile acids and in many cases this type of body was entirely absent. In fact, the
maximum yield from any species of Penicillium is that given by P. lilacinum,
Ad. 32 = 0-049 gm. (Table VII), corresponding to a yield of approximately 1 percent. A
similar absence of the production of volatile acids has already been noticed with species
of Aspergillus (Part III) and hence this biochemical characteristic of these two great
genera of the lower fungi is in very marked contrast to the well-known biochemical
characteristic of many of the bacteria of producing large yields of this class of bodies. IV.
