to refer it to either genus.

P. tabaci has already been criticised (7): there are certain points in its life-history
which resemble those of P. brassicae, and certainly it offers better grounds for inclusion
in the genus than any of those we have so far reviewed. Jones himself, however,
appeared doubtful whether his organism should be placed in the Plasmodiophorales,
and it seems to us a pity that a definite specific name should have been given to it at
that stage in the work.

P. fici-repentis has also been described without a very critical examination, no cyto-
logical details being available, nor are any figures given illustrating the species. So
far as information is available, it would appear to be allied to P. brassicw, and in view
of the fact that it causes hypertrophy of the host cells the genus Plasmodiophora would
be the correct place to which to refer this new species.


AND METHOD OF INFECTION OF PLASMODIOPHORA BRASSICZ. 305

Worontn does not give a precise diagnosis of the species which he described. So far
as we have been able to discover, the name Plasmodiophora brassice first appears in his
paper (67) in 1877. In the paper in ‘ Pringsheims Jahrbiicher’ he speaks as if the
diagnosis had already appeared. Zopr in 1885 (69) diagnosed the genus and the described
species from Woronin’s paper of 1878, and points out that he considers that P. brassice
should be taken as the type species of the genus. Saccarpo (54) subsequently made
use of Zopr’s diagnosis, which he translated into Latin for his ‘ Sylloge Fungorum.’
