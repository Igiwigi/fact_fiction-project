symmetry would result from the fact that a transformation acting on a subsystem of the universe
might have non-trivial observable effects associated with the relation between the subsystem
and the reference system provided by the corresponding environment.!> A different line of
argumentation clings to the fact that a symmetry transformation produces by definition states
that are, strictly speaking, indiscernible. However, this strict indiscernibility cannot be used as
an argument in favour of the thesis that gauge symmetries are mere mathematical redundancies
since the very group(oid)-theoretical structure of these indiscernibilities is an essential feature of
the corresponding theory. The epistemic fact that a given physical configuration can be described
by means of different coordinate systems is a consequence of an intrinsic geometric structure that
characterizes the theory at stake. For instance, the fact that observables in relativistic physics in
flat space-time must be Poincaré invariant is not a mere epistemic constraint that removes the
‘surplus structure’ given by the existence of different frames of reference. Poincaré invariance
rather results from the fact that the underlying space-time is assumed to have a particular
symmetry, which is an intrinsic property of this particular space-time [53].!° It is also worth
noting that the most sophisticated mathematical formalism for dealing with gauge symmetries—
namely, the so-called BRST formalism [111]—does not proceed by removing the gauge symmetries,
but rather by unfolding the higher structure that they convey. Rather than removing the degrees
of freedom that are nothing by ‘pure gauge’ (at least according to the received view), the BRST
formalism increases the original number of variables by introducing the so-called ghosts, ghosts of
ghosts, and so on and so forth.!”

All in all, the problem of analysing the significance of physically indistinguishable
configurations in gauge theories remains an open and fruitful field of research in both physics
and philosophy of physics.
