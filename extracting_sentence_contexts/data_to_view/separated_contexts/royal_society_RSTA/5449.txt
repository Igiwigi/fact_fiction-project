nitric acid,
At the end of half-an-hour the loss in weight of the former was ‘2198 grm,
(value of M/A = 8°85); that of the latter, “1465 grm, (value of M/A = 6:05), or
numbers nearly in the ratio of 3:2. Temperature 17° C.

Tue INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS. The experiments detailed above for the metals copper, mercury, and bismuth, to
which, according to Russett’s experiments, silver must also be added, have established
the following facts :—(i.) the primary change is that between the metals and nitrous
acid ; (ii.) no gas is evolved at first from the surface of the metal ; (iii.) the amount of
nitrous acid increases up to a constant and maximum proportion ; and (iv.)
