Moreover, since we also have

In fact, if <7 Rn j—aogzg=l be the equation to a hyperbola, and we make the ordinate
y=cos?d.tan p, we have the abscissa a= Cv (1—sin'0 smn*p). From these we may

obtain by differentiation,

If we make sin 7=sin 0.sin @, 7 is the angle which the normal of the hyperbola makes
