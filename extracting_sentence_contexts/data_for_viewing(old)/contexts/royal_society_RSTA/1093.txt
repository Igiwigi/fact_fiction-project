Comparison between the measured mean flow and that predicted by the four CFD simulations
were originally shown in [38]. The comparisons are included again in this paper with the results
from the high-fidelity simulations added.

The high-fidelity simulation results are assessed using both the data from the probe files
and by extracting data from the saved volume file. When taking data from the volume file, the
circumferential placement of the probes is an option. Figure 3 shows the volume from the front as
a two-dimensional slice.

In the SDT experiment, the hotwire probe was moved along a single radial line to obtain data
at different locations between the hub and tip. When the radial locations are placed in the volume
at different circumferential locations from 90° to 106°, slight differences in the results are found
as shown in figure 4. The difference is attributed to both the fact that a cartesian grid not aligned
with the wake is used in the gap and that there is an averaging process used when saving the data
into the volume file and an interpolation process used when extracting the data. Note that probe
values are saved without any space averaging or interpolation involved (the value of the probe
containing voxel is used).

Figure 4a shows there is no appreciable grid, sampling or interpolation effect present in the
total mean flow values. However, the calculated average passage wake does vary slightly from
circumferential slice to circumferential slice as shown in figure 4b. The variance of the average
passage wake obtained at the different circumferential locations is about 0.6% at its highest in the
centre of the wake. To account for the difference from slice to slice, when data from the volume file
is analysed, an average of the result over 71 circumferential slices taken in the volume is reported
when possible. Figure 4 shows the increase in the total mean flow introduced by the insertion of
