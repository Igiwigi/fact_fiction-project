revealed the presence of a deeply branched acetyl CoA carboxylase that aligns between the
Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi lineages (figure 3c).


These results indicate that several carbon fixation pathways exist in SLW sediments, and may
indicate a variety of niche spaces for subglacial microbes to occupy and contribute to organic
matter production. This diversity might also reflect redox conditions within microzones of the
SLW sediments. Some enzymes such as form II of the cbbim gene and enzymes in the anaerobic
pathways such as rTCA are oxygen sensitive and are used by microaerophilic and anaerobic
species [91]. There is also the potential for an energetic advantage in organisms that use anaerobic
carbon fixation pathways, such as the rTCA cycle. Under aerobic conditions, the Calvin cycle uses
7-9 ATPs per mole of pyruvate fixed, versus 1-5 ATPs in the rTCA cycle [89,90]. Several of the
sequences detected in this survey are deeply branched, which could be a reflection of the fact
that these genes have not been robustly examined in environmental samples or, alternatively, the
lineages detected in SLW may represent novel groups.
