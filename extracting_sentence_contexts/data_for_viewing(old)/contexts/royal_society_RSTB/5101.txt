terises them, by their great flattened tails, and by the inefficiency of their limbs for
progression on land.

Diplovertebron punctatum, Frirscu, 1885.
= Gephyrostequs bohemicus, JAEKEL, 1902.

The type material of this form consisted only of certain scattered bones, amongst
which premaxille, maxilla, a dentary, several vertebrae, an interclavicle, and an ilium
were figured by Frrrscu. Subsequently JarKen figured a compressed but otherwise
beautifully perfect skull as Gephyrostequs. He did not recognise any resemblance
between his material and Diplovertebron, but the fact that it is clearly an embolomerous
form and the great similarity which its premaxilla, maxilla and dentary present, both
in size and structure, to the corresponding bones of the type renders their identity most
probable. bh -

The best existing specimen is, however, contained in a slab of oil shale from Nyran
which is in my own possession. This specimen shows an impression of the ventral
surface of a skeleton, in the main naturally articulated, and complete except for the
tail and the distal parts of the hind legs, which are cut by the edge of the slab. The
actual preservation is extremely good, every detail even of the minute scales of the
ventral surface being clearly shown on squeezes.

The skull is present complete, but was slightly disarticulated before burial. The
