Now this expression, in virtue of the conjugate relations (13), reduces to the form

So (20) gives the value which we shall obtain for % when an arbitrarily chosen
is inserted in (18),—A, ... , ete. being the constants in the series of type (16) by which
this arbitrarily chosen ¥ is represented. Without seeking to determine A, ...,
etc., we may deduce from (20) that if our assumed ’ is in fact closely identical with a
normal solution ‘V, (so that A, is large in comparison with all the other A’s), then %
will be even more closely identical with 4,. For 4 = % when all the A’s except A,
are zero; and accordingly 4/4, differs from unity by small quantities of the type (A,/A)?,
—that is, by a small quantity of the second order,

Physical Analogues of “ Normal” Solutions of the Simplified Equations.

10. Equations of type (8) and (9) are governing equations in other physical problems
having no connection with Hydrodynamics. We may mention here the problem of
elastic stability in a flat plate of uniform thickness subjected to uniform thrust in its
plane, and the rather more artificial problem of flexural vibrations in a flat plate which
has uniform “rotatory inertia,” compared with which its ordinary (“ transverse ’)
