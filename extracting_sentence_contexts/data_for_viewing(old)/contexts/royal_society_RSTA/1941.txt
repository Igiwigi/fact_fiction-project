simulations and LBM simulations yield similar results, for example, k spectrum for
3D hydrodynamic turbulence (see [12-15,17,18] and references therein). Martinez et al. [18]
performed fluid simulations of 2D hydrodynamic turbulence using LBM and spectral method
in a periodic box of size (27)?, and compared the results in detail. They used a 512” grid for LBM
and a 256* grid for the spectral simulation. For the initial condition, they employed two sharp
vortices of opposite signs. The Reynolds number of the flow based on the relaxation parameter
was 10000. They observed remarkable similarities between the LBM and spectral results, thus
illustrating functional equivalence of the two methods.

The discrete methods are less accurate compared to the pseudo-spectral scheme. Still, given
sufficiently large lattice, discrete methods capture the essential non-equilibrium features of
turbulence. This is due to fact that the presence of large-scale structures and small-scale
dissipation naturally generates the energy cascade, and hence Kolmogorov’s k~*/> spectrum.
Thus, inaccurate methods too capture this robust feature. Note, however, that discrete methods
require larger grids than the spectral method due to the lower accuracy of discrete methods.

It is important to note that numerical implementations of LBM and DSMC have distinct
benefits over their hydrodynamic counterparts [12-15,47,48]. For example, computer programs
based on LBM and DSMC can be efficiently parallelized; they can also take advantage of a large
number of cores available in graphical processing units (GPUs). In addition, implementation of
complex boundary conditions is easier in LBM than in a spectral method [14,15,32]. As a result,
LBM is often employed to simulate numerous complex engineering flows, e.g. flows around
automobiles, cooling of computer CPU, etc. [14,15]. This extensive and important topic however
is beyond the scope of this paper.
