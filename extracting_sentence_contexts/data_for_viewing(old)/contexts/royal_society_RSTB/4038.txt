required for performing a given piece of work at a high altitude as compared with
sea-level, our results enable us to compare the type of the metabolism at the two
places under conditions of the same character when the oxygen consumption was
practically identical, if we contrast the Pike’s Peak experiments with those on the
grass track in Oxford. Our index for this purpose is furnished by the respiratory
quotient, which in our experiments rose invariably during the work. Taking first of
all exercise up to the pace of 44 miles an hour, it will be noted that the actual value
of the respiratory quotient tends to be higher at any given pace on Pike’s Peak than
in Oxford, but if the respiratory quotient during the exercise is compared with that
obtained in the standing rest experiment done immediately beforehand in each
instance, it will be found that the degree by which the respiratory quotient rose is
much the same in each series, since the initial respiratory quotients on the Peak are
on the whole higher than in Oxford. This fact, coupled with the lack of variation in

the respiratory quotients in the two series on prolonging the exercise, leads us to
believe that, whatever the cause at work may be, it was precisely the same in the two
cases. The point that we have to decide is, whether the rise is due to an alteration
in the proportions of the different materials being oxidised in the body, or whether it
is merely the expression of an excessive hyperpneea caused by the production of some
metabolite which does not occur in resting metabolism and stimulates the respiratory
