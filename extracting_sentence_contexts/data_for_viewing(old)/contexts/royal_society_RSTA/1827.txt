The cosmological constant, also known as dark
energy, was believed to be caused by vacuum
fluctuations, but naive calculations give results in
stark disagreement with fact. In the Casimir effect,
vacuum fluctuations cause forces in dielectric media,
Accepted: 24 February 2020 which is very well described by Lifshitz theory.
Recently, using the analogy between geometries
and media, a cosmological constant of the correct
