The diameters of some of the cultures after four days’ growth at 20° C., and of others
after three and five days at 12° C. are shown graphically in fig. 5.

It appears from fig. 5 that the growth rate of DH¢ was unaffected by its proximity
to DH, since all three graphs for DH, are almost horizontal lines and such deviations
as occur are slight, and probably due to the fact that an overgrowth of DH; frequently
prevented accurate measurement by obscuring the margin of DHo.

The graph for DH, after three days at 12° C. is also a horizontal line, but those after
fifteen days at 12° C. or after four days at 20° C. slope steeply upwards from left to right
indicating that, after a certain time, development of a DH; inoculum placed near to
DH, was retarded to an extent which varied inversely with the distance between the
inocula of the two strains.
