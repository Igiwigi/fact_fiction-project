shaped bodies which she. suggested might have been borne on the frond of Stauropteris
burntislandica as glands, although she did not observe a clear attachment between the
two. In 1911 Dr R. Chodat showed attachment of Bensonites with a branchlet of the
‘order n’ of Stauropteris burntislandica and upheld the same view.

In my serial sections there are several instances of attachment of these bodies with the
ultimate branchlets (0-1 to 0-09 mm in diameter) of S. burntislandica. The branches bearing
Bensonites show the same typical characters, such as big epidermal cells, big thin-walled
cortical cells and the structure and the appearance of the stomata, as numerous branchlets
of Stauropterts burntislandica. There is thus no possibility of mistaking the branchlets bearing
Bensonites as belonging to any other plant present in the sections. I have also traced several
0-1 mm branches upwards through successive transverse sections and have found that they
terminated in Bensonites. Moreover, indirect evidence is provided by the fact that the
stalk of Bensonites and an ultimate branchlet of Stauropteris burntislandica frond are identical
in size and structure. Figure 26, plate 4, shows a megasporangium attached by a short
stalk to a branchlet 0-16 mm in diameter which shows a stoma (s) identical with that
shown in figure 19, plate 2. Figure 27, plate 4, provides another example where a branch
of the Vth order has given out a branch of the VIth order which in its turn bears a mega-
sporangium (sp). Figure 28, plate 4, shows two megasporangia borne on a single stalk (sk).

Thus there is no doubt left now that Bensonttes are borne on the ultimate branchlets of
the frond of Stauropteris burntislandica. Since they contain megaspores they are referred to
here as megasporangia of the plant. It is further suggested that the name Bensonites should
now be dropped.
