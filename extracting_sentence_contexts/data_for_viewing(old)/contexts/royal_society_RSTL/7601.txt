cutting L, which also meet da, is dx(cos «+ cos B) ; now the =
zum of all such elements gives the number of lines cutting both YC.
L and the given infinite straight line ; that is, L (art. 4). This \
integral may be otherwise verified. 4

Tf the boundary L be enclosed within any outer convex boundary, let ds be the differ-
ential of the length of the latter, «, Þ the inclinations of ds to the tangents from it to L,
then we find in the same manner,

ſ(cos « + cos B)4s=2L,

the integral extending all round the outer curve.
I mention this merely as an illustration ; it is in fact easy to show independently that
L=fcos «ds=\ cos Bds.
12. If an infinite number of random lines pass between two convex areas, the density
of their intersections will be (as in art. 9) at any point R in the Fig! 7.

g=0—sin0;
and at any point S in the spaces POQ, P'OQ', (
e=r—@—8ngp;
now the whole number of intersections is (art. 7) measured by =
41(PP'+QQ'—PQ—P'Q'Y.
F(9— 8m 9d48+F(7—g— 8m e)4S=Z3(PP'+QQ'—PQ—P'Q'Y;,
