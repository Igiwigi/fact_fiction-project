* The longer period required for doubling in the case of the pair of rods, as compared with the terminal
rod, was due to irregularities which occurred in the rate of growth of the penultimate rod. At times the
growth of this rod almost or quite ceased, therefore the doubling period of the terminal rod alone repre-
sents more accurately the rate of growth of the organism,

inference, the period required for spore-formation, is dependent upon temperature,
and, furthermore, that the optimum is probably nearer 30° C. than 20°C. As to the
minimum temperature at which growth occurs, the following facts are of interest,
though they are not conclusive.

It has been already stated that an effective means of delaying germination and
