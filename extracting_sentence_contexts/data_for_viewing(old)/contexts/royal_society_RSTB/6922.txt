bulging caused by large follicles or corpora lutea. In ovaries in which it is not distorted
by other structures it is from 1-3 to 1-7 mm. in thickness. When follicular growth takes
place the follicles migrate from the cortex, through the inner fibrous layer, into the
peripheral stroma. It is in this part of the ovary that growing follicles and corpora lutea
are found.

Internal to the peripheral stroma lies the central fibrous stroma. It consists of fibrous
tissue, with some unstriped muscle fibres, and contains only small numbers of the
connective tissue and interstitial cells characteristic of the peripheral stroma. Where
these cells occur they are usually clumped together in small islands. This part of the
stroma is highly vascular.

Microscopic examination of the present series of ovaries reveals several salient facts.

The most obvious is the very small number of young follicles to be found in the cortex.
In every section examined this dearth of young follicles is very striking. The number of
growing follicles is likewise few, though when they reach a large size they may occupy a
great part of the bulk of the ovary. The corpora lutea are large in size, and their remains
persist throughout the life of the animal, as already mentioned. These remains do not
consist merely of fibrous tissue, but of luteal cells, which appear to lose their function
