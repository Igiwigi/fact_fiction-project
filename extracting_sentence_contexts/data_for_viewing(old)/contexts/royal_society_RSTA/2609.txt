4. Conclusion

Here, we have shown the possibility to obtain well-ordered nanotubular structures reminiscent of
features observed on different animal and plant species using templateless electropolymerization
in CH2Cly. Surfaces made from the electropolymerization of thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-based
monomers with carbazole and pyrene substituents showed unique and most interesting results,
with robust nanotubular structures forming under a variety of electropolymerization conditions.
This behaviour was attributed to the fact that both these substituents participate significantly
in the polymerization and also in nanotube formation due to high 7-stacking interactions. H2O
content in the electropolymerization solvent was also found to be extremely significant to the


formation of nanotubes, since even trace H2O contributed to a high amount of Hz and O2 bubbles
being released, depending on the electropolymerization method. The surfaces developed in this
study are attractive for many future and growing engineering applications, most notably in water
harvesting systems.
