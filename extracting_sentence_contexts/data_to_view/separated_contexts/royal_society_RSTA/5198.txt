The integral over the angle can be immediately
carried out using the orthogonality of trigonometric functions: Se d¢’ cos[n(¢ — ¢')] = 5n0. The


remaining radial integral can be then straightforwardly calculated

| arog (=) =r-R-+Riog (4). (A3)

I =-2n [r+ 8I08()]. To calculate the integral Iz, we can make use of the fact that

Thus,

Pore = ay el (A4)

Thus, one can write
h=xy. {ar d¢’ log |r — H\— = [dr'ag'e log |r — 1’ |. (A5)

The first integral is calculated by differentiating 1,

The second integral in equation (A5) can be calculated again with the help of the logarithmic
expansion (A 2)

Thus, taking the derivative and combining with equation (A 9) yields

Adding together I; and Ip and switching to polar coordinates gives

Setting CL=R Je and expressing everything in polar coordinates one finally obtains
