These studies mainly emphasize the role of gesture production
by children in eliciting labelling from their parents [92] and in
predicting language development in the children [77,93,95]. Crucially, these findings suggest that childrenâ€™s communicative
milestones in integrating speech and gesture are not the direct
result of the nature of gestural input received [94], and generally
indicate a preponderance of deictic (pointing or showing)
gestures compared to only a small proportion of iconic (or
representational) gestures [94,97]. This latter fact, however, may be the result of scoring
decisions by the researchers. Iconicity may be embedded in cer-
tain kinds of deictic gestures, but may go unreported. For
example, the category of deictic gestures used by Puccini et al.
[98] includes Action Demonstration (with an object), Object
Demonstration (with an object) and Show.
