travels by the cement substance between the epithelial cells.

Emer (41), 1869, tried to demonstrate Hriexnain's theory, He gave drawings of
the connexions of the epithelial cells with the tissne of the villus from sections of a
hardened intestine of a frog}. Ennis further gave drawings of fat-particles in the pro-
cesses of the branched connective-tissue corpuscles of the submucosa of the frog's intes-

* Fins (1865) considered that the intercellular substance between the epithelial cells is in direct communi-
cation with the connectiye-tissue of the villus.

+ Almost all the attempts to establish the connexions of the epithelial cells and the connective-tissue cor-
puscles haye been made from preparations of the frog's intestine ; and this is the more remarkable from the
fact that the epithelial cells in that animal are yery long and narrow, and that it is 80meywhat difficult to how

tine. These corpuscles are attached to the lymphatic vessels (figs. ix. & xiii.) This
author found, during absorption, fat-particles in the cireular muscular layer of the
intestine. He figured fat-particles between the epithelial cells (fig. xx.). Ener further
considered that in mammals the epithelial cells are connected with the tissue of the villus.

ZAWARYKIN (56), 1869, obtained a natural injection of the paths which the chyle tra-
