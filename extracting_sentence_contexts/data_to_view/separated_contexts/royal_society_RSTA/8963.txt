It will be evident from an inspection of the charts we have just described that, even on the most
favourable days, the atmosphere is so far from homogeneous that the propagation of sound according to
the inverse-square law is an approximation of the roughest kind. It is of considerable interest, however,
to compare the actual observed gradient of phonometer readings with the theoretical gradient calculated
from the acoustic output of the diaphone, assuming ideal conditions of sound propagation. If |ép| be the

pressure amplitude at a distance r sufficiently great compared to a wave-length, the ratio of flow of energy
across unit area of wave-front is very approximately given by

[aW/af)=l8p[f(2qm). ee

Expressing the fact that the entire flow of energy across a hemisphere of radius 7 is equal to the acoustic
output at the diaphone, we have

2mr* x |&p|?/(2apo) = (acoustic output)... . . . . . . . . . (ib)
If d is the phonometer reading in mm., we have from the known constant of the instrument

From a knowledge of the pressure of air operating the diaphone, we may obtain a rough estimate of the
acoustic output from the results of the thermal tests 1 or 3 described in Appendix III.

In fig. (i.) are drawn on a large scale the gradients of phonometer readings obtained on August 30,
1913. According to test 1 of Appendix III., the acoustic output corresponding to an operating pressure
of 19-9 Ibs./sq. in. is 1-6 H.P.
