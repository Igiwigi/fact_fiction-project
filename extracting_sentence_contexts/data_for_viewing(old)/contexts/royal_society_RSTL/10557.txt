Sound a great reduction in the percentage of nitrogen in the upper layers of the oil,
dicating the source whence the nitrogen of the vegetation had been derived.
S Bearing in mind these striking facts, we now turn to the botanical characteristics of
he mineral manured plot, as shown in Table LXVIII., pp. 1324-5.

As already referred to, it has been found that the number of species compared with
that without manure is diminished, whatever the description of manure applied.
Taking the average of the four years of complete separation, there were 49 species
found in the samples from the unmanured plot, 33 only by ammonia-salts alone, 39
(over three separation-years only) with the larger quantity of nitrate, and 42 with
the smaller quantity. We have now with the mixed mineral manure alone an
average of 43, which is higher than on any plot with nitrogenous manure, whether
used alone or in conjunction with minerals. The fact is that, with nitrogenous
manure, there is more of forced luxuriance of individual species, varying, it is true,
