We fitted a linear
regression between these two extremes to define the target for
the remaining species (see the electronic supplementary material,
figure S2). We conducted the species-specific target estimations
for the four groups separately. This had the advantage of
enabling us to take into consideration the fact that the minimum
range size for a reptile is different than for a bird species, for
instance. This approach assumed that the species with the largest
range is in an optimal situation and requires a minimal level of
protection (approx. 10%). We then extracted the proportion of range currently covered
for each species, in order to estimate how far speciesâ€™ met their
defined targets (species target achievement), i.e. by dividing
this proportion by the defined target.

(f) Data analyses

We estimated the distinctiveness of species in terms of function
and evolutionary history using the fair proportion metric pro-
posed by Isaac et al. [14].
