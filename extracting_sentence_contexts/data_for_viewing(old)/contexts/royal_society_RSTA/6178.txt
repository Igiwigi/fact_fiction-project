(in string units). This symmetry is one manifestation of a larger symmetry group of string theory,
the T-duality symmetry [69-73]. If we assume that matter is a gas of closed strings in thermal
equilibrium (in analogy to how matter in Standard Big Bang cosmology is considered to be a gas
of point particles in thermal equilibrium), then the symmetry (5.1) implies that the temperature T
obeys

T(R)=T (3) . (6.2)

There is no divergence of the temperature as R — 0. In fact, the physics of R — 0 is dual to the
physics for R—> oo from the point of view of winding modes (which are the light degrees of
freedom for small R) instead of from the point of view of the momentum modes (which are light
for large R but heavy for small R [27].

Due to the presence of the infinite tower of string oscillatory modes, there is a maximal
temperature for a gas of closed strings in thermal equilibrium, the Hagedorn temperature Ty
[28]. As space contracts, then, once the temperature approaches this limiting value, instead of
the energy of the initial string modes (the momentum modes) increasing, the energy flows into
the oscillatory modes, maintaining approximately the same temperature. In the case of heterotic
