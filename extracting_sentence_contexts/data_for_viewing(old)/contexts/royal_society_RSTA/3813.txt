have been for many years. Thus, the state of research regarding wall turbulence is sometimes
described as mature, with the connotation often being that the associated research is incremental
with diminished opportunity for innovation. Recent advances in experiments and simulation
have, however, created a situation that defies this characterization, with the rate of important new
findings now coming with impressive regularity [1,2]. The research described herein adds to and


leverages these findings by documenting recent advances in theory and analysis that underpin
an emergent suite of new models and modelling concepts that seek to overcome the intrinsic
challenges of predicting high Reynolds number wall-flows.

An imperative to develop the means to predict high Reynolds number wall-flow stems from
the fact that these flows have pervasive and long-term scientific and technological importance.
Notably, even small modifications to engineering designs, or advances in predictive capabilities,
can have lasting impact. For example, a reliable turbulent drag reduction of only a few per cent
amounts to enormous annual fuel cost savings for both the commercial airline and shipping
industries. Successful flow manipulations would also reduce pollutant emissions, which for
commercial aircraft are increasingly likely to be regulated by governmental standards similar
to those currently established for automobiles. High-fidelity models are required to ensure the
desired reliability of such predictions, while the intrinsic scale separation phenomenon noted above :
requires that these models scale favourably with increasing Reynolds number. [=
