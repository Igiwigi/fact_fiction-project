Hence h can be determined from the approximation
Vo(to—th)

where /, Vo, ¢, and ¢, are in foot-second units. The slant range R=,/(h?+-x*), and thence, from (1), d can be determined. A more direct determination of the depth of the sea could be obtained from the difference
in the times of arrival of the sounds arriving by paths (a) and (d) but for the fact that the
arrival (d) did not have a sharp beginning. In six out of the twelve records obtained with the depth charges, the time of arrival of
the sound by path (c) could not be accurately resolved. However, from the other six
records a mean sinking rate for the charges could be determined, and this provided, with
increased error, the calculation of firing depth.
