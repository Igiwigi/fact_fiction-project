In that context, the underlying idea in ComPat is that performance of the entire multiscale
application can be predicted by combining two pieces of information together: (1) computational
costs of every single-scale submodel and (2) interactions among submodels. These interactions
are described by the submodel coupling topology and other parameters, such as the number
and dynamicity of their instances. In fact, the claim is that, with only three configurations and
any of their combinations, one can describe all kinds of multiscale applications and predict
their performances on any HPC where the submodels have been profiled. These configurations
are called the multiscale computing patterns (MCPs), and they are the extreme scaling (ES),
heterogeneous multiscale computing (HMC) and replica computing (RC) patterns. In particular, a
multiscale application follows the ES pattern if one submodel (the primary) dominates by far in
terms of application computing costs compared to the other submodels (the auxiliaries), and both
the number and creation of all submodels are static.
