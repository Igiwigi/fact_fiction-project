Voyager 2 images also showed a complex system of narrow streaks stacked in latitude and
forming the so-called ‘scooter’ at 40° S, extending approximately 3000 km (figure 2g). Their clouds
were deeper than its surroundings but their plume-like structure was interpreted as formed
by updrafts in a region with vertical wind shear [72]. In fact, the latitude band approximately
37-47° S has also been very active in bright spot activity during the last 20 years, as recorded
by a variety of telescopes [77], including amateur observers [68]. These spots with sizes in the
range 4000-8000 km stand out in red and near infrared wavelengths, where methane absorption
occurs, therefore implying cloud tops high in the atmosphere, but their convective origin cannot
be proven with the existing data. Bright clouds are also found in the South Polar Feature (SPF) (figure 2g) and South Polar Waves
(SPW), apparently permanent cloud systems since the Voyager 2 flyby and located at sub-polar
latitudes (60-70° S) [73].
