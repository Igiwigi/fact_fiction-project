the well-known formula for the rectification of a plane parabola. When, on the other
band, the sphere becomes indefinitely small compared with the parabola, y approxi-
mates to a right angle, and (58.) becomes

$=þp+tan”'(tany)=2p,
as it should be, since 2 is the angle which the radius vector p makes with the axis.

We shall find the notice of these extreme cases useful,

XXI. Although we have called this curve the spherical parabola, as indicating its
mode of generation, it is in fact a closed curve, like all other curves which are the
intersections of cones of the second degree with concentric spheres. It is a spherical
ellipse, and we shall now proceed to determine its principal arcs.

Let ADG be a parabola, F its focus, O being Fig. 6.
the centre of the sphere which touches the plane
of the parabola at F, and being also the vertex of
the obtuse-angled cone, of which the parabola
ADG is a ection parallel to the side of the cone
OB. Let the angle AOP or the are Fa be y, «
and being the principal semiangles of the cone,

22=3+y=AOB,
