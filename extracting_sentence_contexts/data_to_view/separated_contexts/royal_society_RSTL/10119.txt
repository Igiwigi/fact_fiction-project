Etienne deposits. This Salisburian form
8eems to be confined to our British Dadozylons. That this similarity of contour in
the arrangement of the leaf-bundles is not merely accidental is rendered the more
probable by the fact that transverse sections of young twigs of the ancient and modern
plants display corresponding identities. Thus a section of the bark of a young
Dadozylont corresponds closely with the similar section of a Salisburia, fig. 28, in
both of which the bark is separated into an outer coarsely cellular periderm and an

inner one compozed of much more delicate elements. This observation applies to the

Salisburia, whether in its young state, when the inner bark consists, as represented in
fig. 28, of undifferentiated primitive parenchyma, or, in a later stage of growth, when
the bark is distinctly differentiated into an inner translucent phlosm and an external
phellem layer.
