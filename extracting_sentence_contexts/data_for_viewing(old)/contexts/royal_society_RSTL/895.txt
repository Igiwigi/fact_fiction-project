the results being eight feet, the mean elevation of the summer
house above high water mark appeared to be 221 feet; and
if 10 feet be allowed for the fall of the tide, we nave 21 feet,
for the height of the pendulum above low water, differing


in the length of the pendulum vibrating seconds. g8g

from the former result 22 feet. The height of Dunnose above
the summer house, was also deduced barometrically, and
appeared to be $19 feet, differing from the trigonometrical
determination 26 feet in defect. If this difference be attributed
to error in the barometer, as is most probably the fact, the
proportional error in the elevation of the summer house,
determined barometrically, will be 11 feet, and this being
added to 291 feet, we have 242 feet for the height of the
pendulum above the level of the sea, which is probably within
eleven feet of the truth.

The correction due to an elevation of 242 feet, is 0,997 x
S=0,70; and this, together with the correction for the buoy-
ancy of the atmosphere being added to the number of vibra-
tions before found, we obtain 86038,07 for the number of
vibrations which would be made by the pendulum in a mean
Solar day, in vacuo, and at the level of the sea.
