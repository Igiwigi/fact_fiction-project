this profile happens about half an hour after peak eclipse. This is later than the surface and very
near-surface temperatures, reflecting, therefore, the ‘inertia’ of the boundary layer, rather than the
subsurface, in determining this delay.

The wind behaviour is complex. A low-level jet exists at about 500m at 0930 UTC. This
weakens and rises as the CBL grows in the absence of the eclipse. With it, this jet develops a
second maximum in the stable layer at 200m, and re-intensifies later at about 600m. There is
only a very shallow layer near the surface of weaker winds, though the layer of backed wind
is much more distinct. It is conceivable that discrepancies between modelled and observed wind
behaviour is contributed to by the fact that many anemometers are not located at 10 m, and reports
are corrected to 10m using a relatively simple correction. However, it must be emphasized that,
although the flow is weak, there is considerable mesoscale structure in the low-level flow field.

5. Summary and conclusion

The direct impact of the 20 March 2015 eclipse on UK weather has been evaluated using
simulations performed with a high-resolution state-of-the-art numerical weather forecast model
with and without the eclipse. On this occasion, the major impact was surface-driven through
changes to surface heat and moisture fluxes. These, in turn, changed the boundary-layer
development. In cloud-free areas, the nocturnal stable boundary layer persisted or quickly
re-established during the eclipse. In addition to a reduction in surface temperature (78°C) and
near-surface air temperature (1-3°C), near-surface winds were backed, typically by 20° relative
