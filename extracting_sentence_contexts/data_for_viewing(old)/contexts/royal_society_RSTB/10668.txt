2. The necessity of stabilizing mechanisms

One question that is frequently raised outside of the homeo-
static plasticity field is whether or not these stabilizing
mechanisms are actually necessary for proper brain function.
This question has been repeatedly addressed by theorists and
modellers, and their work typically indicates that without
some form of stabilization of firing rates or synaptic weights,
network models that can store memory patterns in recurrent
synaptic strength become unstable, typically in the direction
of activity being too high [1-4]. These runaway increases
in activity emerge from the fact that most Hebbian strength-
ening mechanisms are dependent on coincident firing
between the pre- and post-synaptic neurons, and this process
involves a positive feedback loop: namely, the more frequent
coincident activity in a group of neurons is, the more likely
that synapses connecting these neurons are strengthened.
These strengthened synapses further increase coincident
activity within the group and very quickly, in a positive
feedback loop, activity pathologically increases.

If some form of stability is necessary, what mechanisms may
