This greatest apparent breadth of the twilight at the cusps
could not, therefore, exceed 0,5 lines, or full two seconds ; and
this in fact was the breadth given it by the observation. It is
scarce possible, that in the determination of so nice an object,
theory should coincide more accurately with observation.

3. But it appears farther from these observations, why, not-
withstanding all the pains'I took, I could perceive nothing of
this twilight at the terminating border of the falcated phase,
and why, on the succeeding evening, this light disappeared
likewise at the cusps. The brightness of the phase will, even
on the first days after the new moon, occasion a strong glare
in the field of the telescope, and this particularly at the
spherical border, terminating the light ; so that the margin con-
tiguous to this border, which is only illuminated by the light
