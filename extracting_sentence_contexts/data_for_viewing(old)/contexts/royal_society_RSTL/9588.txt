motionless nectocalyx a single stimulation. The interpretation of these facts would
geem to be that the general irritability of the excitable tissnes is exalted by the universal
and constant stimulus supplied by the acid to an extent that is jusb bordering on that
which gives rise to rhythmic movement, 80 that when the violent contraction is given
in response to the mechanical stimulus, the disturbance serves to start the rhythmic
movement.

If a paralyzed nectocalyx, while manifesting its artificial rhythm in acidulated sea-
water, be suddenly transferred to normal sea-water, the movements do not cease
immediately, but continue for a considerable time. This fact can easily be explained
by the very probable, and indeed almost necessary, supposition that it takes some time
after the transference to the normal sea-water for the acid to be washed out from
contact with the excitable tissues. Sooner or later, however, as we should expect, in
the normal sea-water the rhythmic movements entirely cease, and the bell hecomes
quiescent, with a normal irritability as regards single stimuli, If it be now again
transferred to the acidulated water, after a shorb interval the rhythmic movements
will again commenceâ€”and 80 on during several repetitions of this experiment, until
the irritability of the tissues has finally become destroyed by the influence of the acid.

Other chemical irritants which I have tried produce substantially similar effects on
the paralyzed bells of Sursia. I shall therefore only wait to describe the influence of
one of these irritants, the action of which in some respects differs from that of acids,
