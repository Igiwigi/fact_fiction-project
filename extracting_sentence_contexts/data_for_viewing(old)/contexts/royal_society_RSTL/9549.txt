gn of the mother-cells of this example, enlarged 400 diameters. Tts three contained
Jlaughter-cells are perfect in their outlines ; those in Mr. SPExXCER's section are more
Shrivelled and ruptured. In none have we a trace of elaters. In the slide containing
Ar. Bixxs' specimen is an obliquely transverse section of another strobilus of which
"he axis has had the same structure as that represented in fig. 16. Tt displays four of
2ts sporangia, all of which are filled with parenchyma, in which no spores or daughter-
"Tells are yeb visible. The sporangium walls, fig. 18, «, are strongly defined, and the
parenchyma, b, entirely fills the cavity of each sporangium, differing in this respect

m most of the other examples which I have seen. This absence of daughter-cells
From each of the parenchymatous cells obviously snggests that we here have the
Strobilus i in a very young state ; yet we find that, in its axis, the peripheral radiating
gvascularlaminze seen in fig. 16, b, are already present, This fact seems to show that
Ewe have at leasb two species of these fruits, distinguished from each other by these
Hlifferences in the structure of the central axis, but identical in every other respect ;
Sboth being equally characterised by a tendency on the part of the vascular axis to
Eaasume more or less distinctly the triquetrous form.
