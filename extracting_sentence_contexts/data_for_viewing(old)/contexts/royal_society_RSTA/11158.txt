THE microscopic study of metals was initiated by Sorsy,* and has been pursued by
Arnotp, ANDREWS, Brenrens, CHAarpy, CHrernorr, Howr, Martens, Osmonp,
Roperts-Austen, SAUveuR, Stead, Weppinc, Werri and others.Â¢ The work of
these authors has demonstrated the value of the microscope in metallurgy, not only
as an aid to analysis, but as a means of observing structure. The structure of pure
metals, of metals containing small quantities of foreign matter, and of alloys, has been
made the subject of microscopic examination, and important conclusions have been
reached. The work to be deseribed in this paper proceeds on the same general lines.
A large part of it deals with a branch of the subject which has not hitherto received
much notice, namely, the effects of strain. The writers believe that they have
established the fact that the structure of metals is crystalline even under conditions
which might be supposed to destroy crystalline structure. They have found that the
plastic yielding of metals when severely strained occurs in such a manner that the
crystalline structure is preserved, The observations to be described show how
crystalline aggregates exhibit plasticity, and how, after straining, a metal continues
to be a crystalline aggregate. The distinction which is often drawn between crystal-
line and non-crystalline states in metals appears to be unfounded.

Except for a few simple innovations, the methods of experiment used in this
research, especially as regards the preparation of specimens, do not differ materially
from those of earlier workers. The specimens were first polished on commercial emery-
paper which had been previously rubbed on a piece of hard steel in order to remove
the coarser particles. They were finished on a rapidly revolving dise coated with fine
