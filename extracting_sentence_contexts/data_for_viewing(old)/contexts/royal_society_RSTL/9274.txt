and then imitated that rhythm by means of single induced shocks thrown in with a key
at the other end of the strip. The effect of these shocks was, of course, to cause the
contractile waves to pass in the direction opposite to that in which they passed when
originated by the lithocyst. Now I found, as I had expected, that s0 long as I con
tinued exactly to imitate the rate of the ganglionic rhythm, s0 long did the waves
always pass in the direction BA—A being the lithocyst, and B the other end of the
strip. TI also found that if I allowed the rate of the artificially caused rhythm to sink
Jightly below that of the natural rhythm, after every one to six waves (the number
depending on the degree in which the rate of succession of my induction-$hocks ap-
proximated to the rate of the natural rhythm) which passed from B to A, one would
pass from A to B#,

Of course the only interpretation to be put on these facts is, that every time an arti-
ficially started wave reached the terminal ganglion it caused the latter to discharge ; but
that the occurrence of a discharge could not in this case be rendered apparent, because
of the inadequacy of that discharge to start a reflex wave. But that such discharges
always took place was manifest, both @ priori because from analogy we may be sure that
if there had happened to be any contractile tissue of appropriate width on the other side
of the ganglion, the discharge of the latter would haye been rendered apparent, and @

* When two snch waves met, they neutralized each other at their line of collision—or perhaps, more cor-
rectly, the tissue on each side of that line, having just been in contraction, was not able again to convey a
contractile ways passing in the opposite direction to the wave which it had conveyed immediately before.
