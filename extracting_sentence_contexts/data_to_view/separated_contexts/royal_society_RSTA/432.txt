I). The deadening action of liquids might be due either to their lubricating effect, lessening
mechanical breakage, or to their damping down of marginal initiation starting at one or
two crystals. From the fact that lead azide is comparatively less desensitized than the other
initiators, and is not easily wetted by the aqueous solutions tested, the lubricating effect
would appear to be more important than the damping down of any detonation started
locally. On the other hand, if only small quantities of liquid are sprayed on, the initiation
which is observed at dry patches does not spread, giving evidence of the damping down of
marginal initiation. (4) MECHANICAL AND THERMAL PROCESSES OF INITIATION
