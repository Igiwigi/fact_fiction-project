And here I feel it not only due to you, but likely, perhaps,
to be of use to future observers, to state that, after many trials
of fancied improvements, and simplifications of your methods,
both in the conduct of the experiment itself, and in the subse-
quent computations, I was finally obliged to acknowledge,
in every instance, even where I succeeded, that I had by
more labour, or by a more circuitous path, reached the same
point to which your rules would at once have led me.

* I am particular in stating these two circumstances, especially the first, from its
being $0 essential to the accuracy of the whole experiment, in all cases where the
diameter of the disk and the breadth of the pendulum, though in fact equal, are placed
at different distances from the eye, and therefore appear under different angles ; and
not, as in your first paper, where they are s0 proportioned that both occupy the
same apparent space when seen through the telescope. I was at first disposed to
think it might be better to observe both the times of disappearance and re-appear-
ance of the white disk, and to assume the mean as the true instant of the coincidence z
but I found by repeated trials, that the time of re-appearance was liable to greater or
less uncertainty according to the degree of light, and other unmanageable circum-
Stances : and having satisfied myself by demonstration that the method of obtaining
the intervals by observing the disappearance was rigorously correct in principle, I
adhered to it ever afterwards as being more simple and infallible in practice,
