when it flies out of its group, or when loss of heat to the air stops its flying and in that way
cuts it off from the group. While resting it reverts to its individual status, or regains a different
form of gregarious status as a member of a basking group, more local and less fluid. During
milling and surging the whole mass of insects is more than an assembly, but less than
a swarm; it is a mob.

Eventually it becomes warm enough for locusts that take off to be able to fly on indefi-
nitely. A new situation now exists, for it has become possible for all the locusts in the mass to
be in the air together. Mass departure has become possible. In this limited sense the rising
temperature causes the mass departure. But the newly created possibility of mass departure
cannot be translated into actuality until all the locusts get into the air.

In fact, as was mentioned, taking off does increase decidedly at this point. There is no
evidence for and no need to postulate any acceleration in the direct effect of temperature on
taking off, or any nervous reaction to the air temperature occurring at this time but not

before. On the contrary, the break in the rising activity curve and the climax of mass
departure can be brought about by an unbroken rise in temperature-regulated activity
among physiologically quite heterogeneous insects, because there eccurs a marked strength-
ening of the gregarious component in the behaviour of all the individuals in the mass.

As soon as flights are no longer curtailed by the coolness of the air the number of fliers in
