The marginal distribution for B is obtained by summing out A,

Pr (by) = D> Prya.py(aj, bx) = Tr(oQh), 6.3)

and that for A by summing out B.

This generalizes in an obvious way to any collection of commuting observables, and allows one
to define a joint probability distribution Pre for every context C associated with ¥. The collection
of all these probability distributions, one for each context, constitutes an empirical model for X in
the terminology of [1]. The fact that these probabilities are all generated using the same initial
state p means that they satisfy a compatibility condition: If two contexts C and D overlap, both will
assign exactly the same marginal distribution to the observables in their intersection C ND, which
itself is a context (or possibly a single observable), even if C and D are incompatible in the sense
that not all observables in C UD commute.

If all the observables in Y commute with each other, ¥ is itself a context, and the probability
distribution for any context C can be obtained as a marginal, by summing out the observables not
in C, of the joint probability distribution Pr. However, even if some observables do not commute
with others, it might still be possible to find a joint global distribution Pry for all the observables
in ¥ such that for each context C the corresponding marginal of Prg, obtained by summing out
the observables not in C, is identical to the Pre obtained using the given p and the Born rule
(5.1). If such a Pry exists—its entries must, of course, be non-negative and sum to 1—we say that
