where ux : [0,T] > R? are measurable controls for k=1,...,m, and we define the control map
u:[0,T]> R™ by u(t) = (u(t), .--,Um(#)) for t € [0,T]. The main difficulty arising in this context
is that one usually deals with control functions u(-) that are discontinuous in time. In fact, one
needs to consider solutions of the finite-dimensional problem (1.9) in the Carathéodory sense, i.e.
functions t +> (y(t), w(t), x(t), v(t)) that are absolutely continuous with respect to time and satisfy
the integral formulation of (1.9). For the sake of completeness and readability of our results, we
report some well-known facts on such solutions in appendix A. In this setting, it makes sense to
choose u € L'([0,T],/), where U is a fixed non-empty compact subset of R?x™ and Uc B(0,U)
for U > 0. Finite-dimensional control problems in this setting are of interest, and we focus on a
specific class of control problems, namely optimal control problems in a finite-time horizon with
fixed final time. We design a sparse control u to drive the whole population of m + N individuals
to a given configuration. We model this situation by solving the following optimization problem
