Although I must con-
sider that Professor DaxigLL laboured under some error when he describes the dis-
charge passing in the form of a spark (8.) when the cells were approximated, yet I
cannot but feel that it will be with the aid, and through the principles of this philo-
sopher's scientific apparatus, which he has so appropriately denominated the constant
battery, that the true principles of voltaic action will be correctly ascertained. There
is already one fact which was obtained with the 160 pairs (10.) which cannot, I be-
lieve, be satisfactorily accounted for by any of the existing theories. TI allude to the
remarkable heating of the positive electrode two inches beyond the part where the
circuit was completed*,

Before I conclude, I should wish it to be distinctly understood that I offer no opinion
as to the possibility of obtaining the striking distance or spark before contact ; I
merely present an account of those experiments which have been made by me to ob-
tain it. That according to the present theoretical views of the action of the voltaic
battery, with the apparatus I used, it onght to have taken place, I think most persons
will acknowledge ; and also, that if by still more powerful apparatus it cannot be pro-
dnced, the theory must in s0me way or other be incorrect.
