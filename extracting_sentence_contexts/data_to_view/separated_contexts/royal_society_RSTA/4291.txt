In other words, the refractive index effect acts like a correction to the VC collision
frequency. This was the case of the water experiment at 1.39 |1m, in which the H;80 pressure
varied between 150 and 500 Pa. In fact, the relative deviation from linearity of n â€” 1 versus p

results to be at the ppm level across the pressure range of interest. It is worth noting that, in a global fitting approach, the refractive index effect can be properly
and accurately considered by using equation (7.4), circumstance that represents a further reason



to adopt the global approach. Because, in most cases, the gas pressure is unknown, the correction |e |
should we written in terms of integrated absorbance, A, as follows:

A [a we
A Av? + Ave 1/14 -1], 7.6
YD = Avy + AvD SL \ ep * BeokeT (78)

Avp, being the zero-pressure limit of the Doppler width, given by equation (1.1).
