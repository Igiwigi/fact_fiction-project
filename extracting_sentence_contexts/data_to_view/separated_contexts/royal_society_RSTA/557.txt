This corresponds to the period where sea-ice and snow increase most [13]. In the
LGM, the period with negative feedback during summer reflects the reduction of sea-ice in
the Arctic Ocean (figure 2c(i)). This counterintuitive result can be explained by the fact that
the Arctic Ocean is actually much smaller at LGM compared with PI conditions, because of the
extension of land or ice-sheets in this area. Even though sea-ice generally extends further south
in the North Atlantic/Nordic Seas at the LGM, this does not compensate for the decrease from
70% to 42% of the area available for sea-ice formation north of 70Â° N. On the other hand, the
negative feedback in June in the MH simulations is directly linked to a slight delay in the melting
of sea-ice in response to the insolation forcing.
