the external surface of a stem. It is conceivable, however, that C. Cannochensis might
be the pith-cast of CL Britannicus, though this is by no means certainly the case. It
is at present impossible to prove or disprove this possibility.

There are but few foreign examples known to me with which any comparison can
be made, and these are all from rocks of much younger age. There is some similarity
to the Calamites distichus of Renauur, from the Commentry Coalfield.* The
length of the internodes and the shape of the infranodal canals are, however,
different in the Stephanian specimen. The Staffordshire specimen also appears to
be quite distinct from the Calamites (cruciatus) quinquenarius, yar. Déhlensis of
Srerzeu,t from the Lower Permian of Saxony.

In view of these facts, and especially the great difference in the age of the
Continental specimens, I prefer to regard the present plant as a new species,
C. Cannockensis.
