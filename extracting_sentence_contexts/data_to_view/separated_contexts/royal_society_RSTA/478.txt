What is different to most coarse-grained ductile materials is
the steep increase of J after crack initiation. A similar trend in the J-resistance curve behaviour
was also observed for UFG Ti [24]. The much higher Jjc can be explained by the fact that its
definition per the ASTM standard allows a stable crack advance up to 0.2mm, whereas J; defines
the first physical crack advance. The further steep increase is also somewhat surprising, because in
coarse-grained material the slope would normally flatten out. Another reason for the steep slope
was found with fractographic observations, which showed a pronounced crack path tortuosity
leading to local re-blunting processes and thus to a strong increase in the local COD with almost
no crack advance.
