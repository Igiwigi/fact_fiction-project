HeRSCHEL on the action of

violet illumination. Moreover, it is evident from the preceding
theory, that any difference which may exist in their position,
if too small to be sensible to the eye, can produce only an
imperceptible deviation of tints. In fact, if we suppose a =0 .
for any colour, we get, for the position of the virtual pole,

9 being the angular distance of the point of coincidence from
the single axis of that colour, It is, consequently, insensible
when Ja is 80. Now, the polarising force of the apophyllite
being very feeble, the diameters of the rings in any plate of
moderate thickness must so far exceed this very minute quan-
tity, that the virtual poles, did any exist, must fall within the
limit of the central blackness ; the Newtonian scale would
still appear to commence from the centre, nor could any sen-
sible deviation from it arise from this cause.

2. When the prismatic spectrum is passed over an appa-
ratus containing a plate of this mineral, no perceptible change
in the magnitudes of the rings for different colours takes place.
