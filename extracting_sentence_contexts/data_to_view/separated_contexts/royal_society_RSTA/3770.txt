But to the general reader, it
is of interest to gain some idea of the visual spectra, and these have been reproduced
in Plate 3 from drawings made under the supervision of Professor ErpMann, from
tubes furnished to him by us. The spectra of neon, krypton, and xenon cannot be detected in that of crude argon,
even by photographic methods. The change of spectrum produced in argon by the introduction of a jar and spark-
gap is well known; but less attention has been paid to the fact that helium, too,
alters its spectrum, though much less markedly. The effect of the jar and spark-gap
with krypton is almost to obliterate the spectrum; the brilliant yellow and green
lines disappear. The spectrum of neon is hardly changed; but that of xenon is
enormously intensified; indeed the plate shows the jar and spark-gap spectra of
xenon.
