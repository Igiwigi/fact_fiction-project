Skull of adult Urodeles and Batrachians. A reference to the figures in my papers on the Batrachian skull, and to those of
AmiMlystoma and Seironota in the present communication, will serve to show at once the
sharp distinctness between the two types, and yet their general resemblance. One great difficulty in comparing them arises from the fact that several of the Urodeles

o are perennibranchiate, and therefore permanently quasi-larval; there are no such Batra-
S chians, and one of that group, namely Pipa, is nearly abranchiate.

© Looking at the skulls of adult (Caducibranchiate) Urodeles and Batrachians from the
Z surface we sce the following differences :—

S The roof-bones remain distinct in the Urodele; in the Batrachian the frontal and
= parietal of the same side coalesce. EE) In the Urodele the nasal is supplemented by an external prefrontal bone, and is
St therefore much smaller,

= The premaxillaries are distinct in the lower and about half the higher Urodeles; in
= the rest there is an azygous bone with two long nasal processes. E These bones are constantly distinct in Batrachia, and the nasal processes are short.
ba) The maxillary grows further backwards along the face in Batrachia than in the Uro-
S deles ; in one of these, namely Amblystoma, there is a 8mall jugal; in none a quadrato-
V Jjugal, a constant bone in the Batrachia, binding the cheek to the quadrate.

= ; There is only one © temporal bone ” in both kinds, with the exception, again, of Ambly-
EY sfoma; and in the Urodeles this does not s0 often grow into the postorbital region.

= Beneath, the parasphenoid is much smaller and more specialized in the Batrachia
Z than in the Urodeles; it begins much earlier in the latter, in the Batrachia it develops
B=] into a dagger with a large basitemporal guard.
