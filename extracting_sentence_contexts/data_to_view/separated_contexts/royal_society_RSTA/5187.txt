It is well known that many more earthquakes are recorded as felt during the
night than during the day, and that this is due partly to the stillness of the night,
â€˜but more, perhaps, to the position of the body during repose being more favourable
for the detection of slight tremors. Now, the maximum of the annual period occurring
during winter, it may seem possible that the periodicity may be apparent only, and
due to the greater number of shocks observed during the longer nights of winter. The question is one that deserves examination, and the following facts seem to me
conclusive in establishing the reality of the annual period. In the case of the earthquakes recorded at Tokio by the Gray-Milne seismograph,
there can, of course, be no doubt. But this is the only case treated in this paper in
which the shocks are registered entirely by instrumental means.
