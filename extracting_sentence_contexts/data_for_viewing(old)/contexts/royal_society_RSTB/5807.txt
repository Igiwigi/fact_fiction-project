January for clearance, as shown in figs. 22-23, p. 356. Thus the regime of these canals
is such as might generate a wave of underground water with a 21-day period if there were
any appreciable leakage from them. It may be noted that in irrigation estimates such
un-lined canals are usually reckoned to lose 10 per cent. of their discharge by such
leakage. We proceed to examine our records for this Canal-wave Effect.

The records of the two western pits are superposed for three years and a half in
fig. 25, p. 357. They are obviously waved, these waves being superposed on a curve
which broadly resembles that of Pit III. Also the curves are interesting as a check on
the exactitude of the observations, since the most trivial fluctuations are shown by both.
By inspection of such fluctuations it can be seen that the waves tend to reach Pit XVI
rather sooner than the other pit, though the latter is slightly nearer the canals; this
might be correlated with the fact that in 1913 the senior author found an actual spring
of water at 60sâ€”Oe, emerging from the Sawahel canal through a sand bed ; water from
this region would reach Pit XVI sooner. There is, however, a consistent difference in
level at all times of the year, the northern pit standing higher than Pit XVI, which would
indicate that the difference is due to permeability differences along the water-paths,
such as have already been noted for the tube-wells of Pit XVI in fig. 3. This difference
in level is not shown by fig. 25, p. 357, which is plotted with the curves closely superposed
to emphasise their similarity.

We can thus take Pit XVI as being typical of the free water-table conditions on the
west side of the farm, subject to later confirmation by bore-hole data. Its movements are
plotted concurrently with those of Pit ITT in figs. 17-19, pp. 352-3, where it is instantly
obvious that its waves are transmitted eastward over 4 km., generating similar waves
