sharp edge of the glass shaves off the cuticle. The shavings are easily visible and may
be collected if necessary.


THE STRUCTURE OF HAIR, WOOL, AND RELATED FIBRES. 81

The X-ray photograph of peeled, unstretched human hair was just the same as that
of normal human hair, except that the removal of the scales appeared to bring about an
increase of definition. It is shown in Plate 2, fig. 1. This experiment demonstrated that
the «-photograph described above arises from the main hair substance of the cortex,
to which may be referred the majority, if not all, of the characteristic tensile properties,
and justified any subsequent discussion of these properties in the light of X-ray observa-
tions. This conclusion was indeed fairly sure from the fact that all fibres examined,
in spite of widely differing appearance and dimensions, gave substantially the same X-ray
photograph ; but the peeling of the fibres by purely mechanical means was necessary
to settle all doubts. There then remained only the suggestion that the prominent
scales of Merino wool are responsible for the central halo which distinguishes the Mermo
photograph, but we have not at the moment confirmed this hypothesis on account of
the great difficulty of manipulating this fine and crimpy wool.

Another point which might possibly be considered as an objection to the photographs
described here is that human hair and prepared wools have been subjected to soap-
scouring which might conceivably cause incipient hydrolysis of the protein and thus
produce false X-ray effects. That such a criticism is without weight is proved con-
clusively by the fact that the characteristic features of the «-photograph are independent
