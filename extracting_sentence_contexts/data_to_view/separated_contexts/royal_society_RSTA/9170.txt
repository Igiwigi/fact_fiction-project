A. E. H, TUTTON ON THE

A determination with Plate 3 at temperatures up to 65° indicated that 2E increases
rapidly on rise of temperature, a fact which accords with the alteration of the
refractive indices by rise of temperature. For Na light the angle at the ordinary temperature, 15°, was 114° 46’, at 40° it
had increased to 131° 15’, at 45° to 136°, at 50° to 138°, at 55° to 143°, and at 65° to
158° 20’. The angle thus increases by 44° for 50° rise of temperature.
