On opening some of the diseased grains, I found their ca-
vities filled with a mass of a white fibrous substance, appa-
rently cemented together by a glutinous substance, and
formed into balls, which could easily be extracted entire from
the cavities of the grains, and which, when immersed in
water, instantly dissolved, and displayed in the field of the
microscope, hundreds of perfectly organized, extremely mi-
nute worms, all which, in less than a quarter of an hour, were
in lively motion. Having left some of these worms on a glass for five days
in a perfectly dry state, they were apparently dead; but
when moistened, they were again, in less than half an hour,
as lively as ever. These experiments and results were 50 far satisfactory, as
they incontestibly established the fact, that [the fibrous sub-
stance within the cavities of the diseased wheat grains, con-
8ists of real organized animals, which are endowed with the
extraordinary property, of having their muscular action sus-
pended for a considerable length of time, and of having it
renewed again by the mere application of moisture : but how
these animals are propagated, and how they are introduced

into the cavities of the young germens, appeared tome a mys-
tery, which I was convinced could only be unravelled by
tracing them through every stage of the germination and


suspension of the muscular motions of the vibrio tritici. 3

vegetation of the growing plant of wheat ; and believing that
the eggs of these- worms must be conveyed into the cavities
of the very young germens of the flowers of wheat by the
circulating sap, in the same manner as the seed of the para-
sitical fungi which occasion the well-known disease in wheat,
the smut-balls, and which I had, in former experiments, suc-
cessfully inoculated upon sound wheat, I determined to try
the same experiment with these worms. I therefore selected
some sound grains of wheat, and placed some portions of the
mass of worms in the grooves on the posterior sides of the
grains, and planted them in the ground in the month of Oc-
tober, 1807. Nearly all the seeds came soon up, and I took
from time to time some of the young plants for examination,
but could not perceive any effect of the inoculation, till the
month 'of March, 1808, when, in carefully slitting open the
$hort stalk of a young plant, I found three or four worms
within it; they were in every respect the same, but they
were. now about two-thirds larger, as well in length as in
diameter,
On the 5th of June I found, for the first time, some' of the
- worms, of different sizes, within the cavities of the young
germens; and having, in the beginning of March, found some
of them in an enlarged state in the stalk, I concluded that
some of the original worms, with which I had inoculated the
grains of seed, had got, during the germination of the grains,
into the. stalk, where they became mature, and laid their
numerous eggs, some. of which must be carried by the
circulating sap into the cavities of the then forming young
germens, in which the young worms extricate themselves
from these eggs; and finding their proper nourishment
