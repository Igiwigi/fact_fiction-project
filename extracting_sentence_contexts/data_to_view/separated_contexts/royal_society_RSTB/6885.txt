Nevertheless, the thin layer of incipient vascular tissue which lies
immediately below the apical meristem undergoes further development and becomes fully
differentiated into phloem, xylem, etc. New vascular tissue is also developed in the isolated
terminal region, and a solenostelic and dictyostelic vascular system is eventually developed. In short, vascular tissues are formed notwithstanding the fact that there is no organic
connexion with the mature vascular tissue below, i.e. the influence of the older preformed
tissues has been precluded. Such observations and the configuration of the pseudo-dicho-
tomous specimens which have been described and illustrated give strong support to Langâ€™s
third suggestion, and to the present writer's hypothesis (Wardlaw 19444), that in the
pteridophytes the initial differentiation of vascular tissue is related to the downward diffusion
of an unspecified substance (or substances) from the actively growing apical meristem. Views relating to the fundamental nature of the shoot system are broadly speaking of
two kinds, phytonic and axial (or strobilar) (Bower 1935; Wetmore 1943).
