Thus, in the case of Ipomea purpurea, the association is distinctly negative—
crossing with another flower of the plant was worse than pure self-fertilisation—but
in both the other cases it is positive. Mimulus, it is true, offers somewhat doubtful
evidence (two experiments having given conflicting results), but the coefficient of
association is almost twice its probable error. The foxglove certainly exhibits far the
highest and most significant association. Two out of the three species give a positive
result, and if all the species are pooled together the result is positive. The fact is we
are looking, in all probability, for a very small association, and extensive experiments
may be necessary to render its existence certain. Taking the above results together,
I should certainly say they gave evidence on the whole of a positive association. The
odds against the negative association in the case of Jpomea occurring as a purely

chance deviation from the positive would be, roughly, twenty-one to four, or say five
to one only—not overwhelming odds by any means.

As in the general case of complete crossing versus self-fertilisation, the differences
