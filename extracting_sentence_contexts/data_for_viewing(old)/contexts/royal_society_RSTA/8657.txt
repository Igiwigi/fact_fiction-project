the principal discharges and the beginning of thunder are all about 5 km.
The characteristic curve of recovery after the passage of each discharge is well
shown.

Heavy black clouds were overhead at the beginning of the record and slight rain
began about 14h. 48m, 30s. and became heavy at about the time when the record ceased.
The effect of the rain is shown by the downward slope of the latter portion of the
trace, which indicates a flow of positive electricity from the earth through the
capillary electrometer to the test-plate. How much of this positive charge went to
increase the induced positive charge on the test-plate (on account of increasing
negative potential gradient) and how much to neutralise a negative charge carried
down to the test-plate by rain drops, or by ions travelling under the influence of the
negative potential gradient, remains undetermined owing to the fact that the cover
was not replaced until after the record was completed.

This is an enlargement of a portion of a record obtained while a severe storm was
passing at a distance of 15 to 20 km. Between 20h. 20m. and 20h. 29m. the photo-
graphic trace recorded 95 positive discharges (Â¢.e., discharges causing a sudden
positive change of potential gradient) and 40 negative discharges. The discharges
were visible as vertical flashes passing between a cloud near the N.W. horizon and
the earth, many of the flashes being multiple. The storm was seen to travel from
W. to N.; newspaper reports show that it passed over St. Ives, which lies from 10 to
11 miles (about 17 km.) to the N.W., damage by lightning occurring there. The mean
