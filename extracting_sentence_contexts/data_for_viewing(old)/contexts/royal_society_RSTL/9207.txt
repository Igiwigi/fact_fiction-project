may neyertheless be sometimes observed that those tentacles which are nearest to the
seat of stimulation respond with a sudden contraction, then those next adjacent to them
on either side do the same, and 80 on—there being thus started in the margin two im- -
pulses which travel with equal rapidity in opposite directions, and the passage of which
is marked by the 8uccessive and intensely sudden retraction of the numberless tentacles
by which the margin is fringed. This most beautiful expression of the passage of a wave
of stimulation does not occur in all, or even in most, specimens of Aurelia. It may best,
be seen in specimens that are perfectly fresh and vigorous—-. 6., in general, such as are
deeply coloured. Moreover, just as in the case of reflex action, 8 in this case, the wave
of stimulation may be started from some tracts more certainly than from others,
although there is no constancy as to the position of these tracts in different indivi-
duals. - As showing the identity of the wave of stimulation in this case and in that
of reflex action, I may mention the following fact. When a single lithocyst is left in
8i7u and a point in the neryo-muscular sheet at a distance from the lithocyst is gently
irritated, if the passage of the stimulus happens to be marked by the above-described
occurrence of what we may term a tentacular wave, it is always observable that the
lithocyst never originates its reflex response until after the tentacular waye has reached
it, and that it then inyariably does 80 when the requisite period of latent stimulation
has elapsed, viz. about half a second after the arrival of the tentacular wave. This
experiment may be rendered particularly fascinating if the Aurelia has been pre-
viously cut into a broad strip, in snch a way as to leave the single remaining litho-
cyst at one end; for on now irritating the other end of this strip, the tentacular wave
may be observed to run continuously in the same direction all the way along the
margin, and then, after it reaches the terminal ganglion and the period of ganglionic
latency has elapsed, the contractile wave which it has been the means of starting from
