Our observations prove the reality of this
hypothetical maximum, whilst, at the same time, they show the futility of any
definition of “ normal dispersion’ which depends merely on the removal of
the maximum from the easily-visible into the violet or ultra-violet region of
the spectrum; a similar usage of this term by WryrHer has already been
criticised (Lowry, * Trans. Chem, Soc.,’ 1915, vol. 107, p. 1195) on the ground
that it implies a physiological definition of a purely physical property. Anoma-
lous dispersion depending on the imperfect compensation of two simple rotatory
dispersions of opposite sign may, as a matter of actual fact, be rendered normal
by displacing the maximum to infinite wave-length in the infra-red ; but any
displacement in the opposite direction only exaggerates the invisible maximum
in the ultra-violet region.*

7. TARTRATES OF THE ALKALI-METALS. In his sealed note, communicated to the Academy on August 25, 1834, Bror referred
for the first time to the rotatory power of the tartrates in the following terms :—‘‘ The
combinations of tartaric acid with solid bases give products endowed with rotation
towards the right ; but the relative intensity of thesé rotations for the different simple
rays obeys the general law of this phenomenon, to which tartaric acid alone is a marked
exception, at least, among all the bodies which I have been able to study hitherto ”
( Comptes Rendus,’ 1835, vol. 1, p. 458).
