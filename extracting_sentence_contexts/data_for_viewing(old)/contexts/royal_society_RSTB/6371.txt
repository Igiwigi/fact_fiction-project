pleuro-sphenoid (vAN WiyjHE). GoopricH prefers the latter form. As a cartilage it
can be traced from fishes, through most amphibians and reptiles to the monotremes.
It is rarely ossified. GoopricH suggests that the large “ sphenethmoid” of some
Stegocephalians may include this posterior pleuro-sphenoid, and with this I agree.

In the Phytosaur Machaeroprosopus gregorii, as shown by Camp (1935), the pleuro-
sphenoid (latero-sphenoid) is a large bone with a foramen at its base for, it is believed,
the sixth nerve and certain branches of the fifth. The upper part of the bone forms a
large part of the wall of the brain-case, and it passes forwards to form the inter-
orbital septum and the wall of the olfactory lobes (what I believe to be the pre-
sphenoid and most others call the sphenethemoid). Very probably if a young Phyto-
saur were examined we should find the pleuro-sphenoid and the pre-sphenoid distinct
bones. The fact that the two elements are fused in the Phytosaurs, and also in the
Embolomerous amphibians seems strongly to support the view that they are ossifica-
tions of the same lateral wall cartilage.

In the Therapsids, so far as is known, we only find an ossified pleuro-sphenoid in the
Therocephalians, the Bauriamorphs, and some Gorgonopsians. It apparently never
occurs in Anomodonts or Cynodonts as a bone. In the Therocephalians, which I

have sectioned, it is a somewhat rudimentary structure; but whether in the ancestors
of the Therapsids it ever was a large bone is very doubtful. Probably in most early
