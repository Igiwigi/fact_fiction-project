in small masses, but the phenomena are quite different from those which are here
under consideration. If motile Euglenze are exposed in a shallow vessel to light,
they gradually come to the surface and form a thin scum in contact with the air.
If the liquid is then shaken or stirred up, the Euglene at the surface become
clumped together into small granular masses, and an appearance of curdling is
produced. This only takes place among those Euglenee which have reached
the surface, and is due, no doubt, to the secretion of a slime which, as
KuawkInk (â€™86) points out, is always produced around Euglene in the presence
of oxygen in a good light. If the Euglene are prevented from coming into
contact with air no agglutination is visible, however much they may be shaken or
stirred up.

B. The Action of Molecular Forces. Cohesion Figures.-The fact that the
organism is heavier than water and that the downward movements are
due to the mechanical action of gravity suggested the possibility that the
network-like grouping and aggregation might also be a purely physical phenomenon

due to surface tension and cohesion, and it occurred to me that the behaviour of
chemical precipitates and other fine sediments of various kinds might afford
some clue to an explanation of the phenomena. I accordingly made a few
preliminary experiments, and at once obtained such results as tended to confirm
this view.
