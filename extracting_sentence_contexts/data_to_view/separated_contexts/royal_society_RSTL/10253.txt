: For a long time I could not exactly determine whether the band in red specimens
Bf Actinia mesembryanthenum, occupying the position nearly of that of reduced
hemoglobin, was not the same as that of Actiniochrome, because Professor MosELRY's
drawing of the spectrum was lost, but on examining Punodes erassicornts, in which
Actiniochrome occurs, I was able to decide this point. The band of Actiniochrome is
nearer the red, and is represented in Chart I., spectrum 16. The next point to be determined was whether the same decomposition products could
be obtained from the respective colouring matters, but as long as I dealt with 80lid
