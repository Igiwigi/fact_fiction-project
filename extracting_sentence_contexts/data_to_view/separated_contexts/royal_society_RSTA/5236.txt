The mechanism responsible for the appearance of such chaotic regime is attributed to front
interactions. Tesio et al. [220] discuss the self-organization phenomenon in cold atomic gases that
manifests itself as a spontaneous emergence of long-range spatial order from fluctuations in the
transverse plane. Using the Kuramoto model, this process is interpreted as a synchronization
transition in a fully connected network of fictitious oscillators. In nonlinear fibre optics, a vector
model describing an erbium doped mode-locked fibre laser with carbon nanotube saturable
absorber is investigated by Sergeyev [221]. In particular, the author discusses the formation of a
new family of vector dissipative solitons with fast and slowly evolving polarization states in this :
system.
