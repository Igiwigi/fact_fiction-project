Fo R the last four years I have been engaged, with the aid
of Mr. Baver's microscopical observations, in examining the
mode of generation of the fresh water muscle and oyster ;
illustrating the changes that occur by Mr. Baver's drawings
in the same manner as has been done with respect to the egg
of the pullet, the frog, the earth worm and barnacle. But
as it will require another season to complete this investiga-
tion, I am desirous of preceding it with an account of the
formation of pearls ; the discovery of which was made in the
early parts of my enquiry into the mode of generation of the
fresh water muscle. I am the more desirous of laying before the Society these
new facts respecting pearls at this moment, when the public
mind is directed to the improvement of the pearl fishery, and
therefore every thing respecting them will be received with
greater interest than at any other time,

In examining the organs of generation of the large fresh
water muscle, I very frequently met with what are called
seed pearls; and these were always found in the ovarium, or
connected with the hell on which the ovarium lay. I at the
same time accidentally discovered that all oriental pearls
that are split into two halves have a brilliant cell in the centre;

this, however, where the pearl has been bored is destroyed,
and upon comparing the size of the central cell with that of
one of the ova, it is exactly large'enough to contain it.”
