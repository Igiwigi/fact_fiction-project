August and September they decrease rapidly to a diameter of 130-150 », and remain
within these limits throughout October and November. From December to the end
of March there is a gradual increase, and by April the breeding season condition is
reached in most animals. Testes with smaller tubules occur throughout April, May

and June, showing that there is much individual variation in the attainment of full
breeding activity.


PROCESSES OF CERTAIN MAMMALS. 285

Consideration of the relation between the diameter of the testis tubule and the weight
of the testis is complicated by the fact that the material, taken as a whole, includes
three groups :—

(a) Immature animals developing for their first breeding season.

(b) Adult animals recovering from ancestrus for another breeding season.

(c) Animals declining into ancestrus.

As pointed out above, the first two of these groups cannot be distinguished as the
breeding season approaches, but in plotting the diameter of testis tubule against testis
weight, group (¢) above has been segregated roughly by considering adults in June—
