from aldoxime there must be an oxidation process. EB Active processes of oxidation in the blood are paradoxical to the generally received
3 physiology of to-day. It is a well proved fact that active processes of oxidation take
4 place in the tissues, indeed we know that such is a necessary condition for the life
@ of the tissue cells. I cannot see why it should therefore be argued that oxidation
% processes cannot take place in the blood. The blood is also a tissue containing living
= cells.
