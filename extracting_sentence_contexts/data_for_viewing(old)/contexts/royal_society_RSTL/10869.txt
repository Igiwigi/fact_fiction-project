There are also two other bands nearer violet, too faint to be read. In the auricle and
ventricle of the duck they give the same readings.

Putting M for myohzmatin and H for hamoglobin, the following rough sketch will
give an idea, of the distribution of myohematin in the yoluntary muscles of a bird
(pigeon) :—

* In fact the pectorals of the pigeon are mainly, if not altogether, coloured by myohematin.

Bieeps of forelimb, M and H ; triceps, M and H; latissimus dorsi, M and traces of
H; trapezius, M and H ; musecies connecting skull to spine, M and H; tail museles,
H; flexors of forearm, M and H ; extensors, M. and H ; sartorius (?), M and H ; other
thigh muscles, M and H; tibialis anticus, M and H ; gastrocnemius, M ; abdominal
museles, M and H ; 0 that in all the voluntary muscles examined, we find myohe-
matin, except in those of tail.

In the gizzard of the same bird there are also decided traces of myohzematin, but
