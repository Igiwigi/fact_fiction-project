normally essential for the continuance of lactation in mammals is similarly to be
accounted for on the assumption that exteroceptive stimuli are conveyed from the
nipples to the anterior pituitary by nervous paths. And the further fact that
menstruation in women in about 60%, of cases is inhibited by suckling is perhaps also
relevant. General evidence of a functional correlation between the hypothalamus and the
gonads is furnished by the described effects of hypothalamic lesions in inducing the
symptoms of dystrophia adiposo-genitalis. SmirH (1930) has included genital
atrophy among the results of injury to the tuber cinerum in the rat, but according to
Cusuinc (1932) the gonadal effect may be an instance of interference with the
hypophysial blood supply or with its nerve supply.
