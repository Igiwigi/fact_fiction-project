the substance, but their mean period does not change. If we consider a system ¢
ordinary hydrodynamical isolated vortex-atoms, a rise of temperature is represente¢
by increase of the energy, and that involves an expansion of each ring and
diminution of its velocity of translation; such an expansion of the ring would i
turn alter the periods of its electric vibrations. The question arises, how far th
action of the atomic charge will modify or get rid of these two fundamenta
objections to a vortex-atom theory of gases. Independently of this, it seems q
reasonable to hold that in the case of atoms paired together into molecules by the
electrical and chemical forces, the size and configuration of the rings will |

the fact that molecular impacts do not explode a mixtare like hydrogen and chlorine.]
