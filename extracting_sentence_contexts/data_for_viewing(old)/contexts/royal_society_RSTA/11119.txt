Thus the statistics of the girls do not at all support the first impression given by
the figures for boys, and the whole of Table I. is directly adverse to any such
hypothesis. In 10 cases out of the 12 of that table the associations are smaller in the
second investigation, but in 6 cases out of 8 the proportions of defects are also
smaller. Finally, it must be remembered that the theorem given on p. 288 in the
section on Probable Errors does not lead us to expect @ priori any correlation between
degree of association and degree of defectiveness, and we must therefore demand
pretty clear proof of the existence of such an empirical relation. The facts shown
below that women are at once less defective and more highly associated than men,
and that partial coefficients of association in undefective universes are higher than
total coefficients, and much higher than partial coefficients in defective universes
(Tables IV, and V, pp. 306-307), may be said to bring some support to such a hypo-

thesis, but other explanations are here possible. The fact that the association
decreases throughout life, as far as we can judge from present material, while
defectiveness Â«also decreases in later childhood (cf below, p. 310) is against it,
Thus I do not think we can accept the hypothesis without wider evidence ; I have
