barrier for surface-to-bulk diffusion is of about 0.7 eV [53,61]. Our calculations indicate a barrier
for surface diffusion of about 0.7eV (see below). Thus, the barrier for H diffusion on the
titania surface is higher than that required to diffuse an H atom from the Ru cluster to the
oxide surface.

From an electronic point of view, the addition of a single H atom to TiO or ZrO) leads to
the reduction of the two oxides with the formation of Ti>+ 3d! and Zr*+ 4d! centres. This gives
rise to localized electrons in the material. The occurrence of a chemical reduction of the oxide
by hydrogen addition or by hydrogen spillover is clearly shown by the net atomic charges. In :
particular, when an H atom migrates from the Rug particle to TiOz or ZrOz, the nuclear motion [=
is accompanied by a charge flow from the metal to the oxide. Note, however, that things are 3
different on the bare surface of zirconia when more than one H is adsorbed. In this case, in :
fact, the preferred situation is that corresponding to the formation of a proton and a hydride 1G
ion (heterolytic mechanism). This is because a hydride ion bound to Zr** has its levels at lower :
energy than the Zr 4d states. : Ke]

These theoretical results shed light at the atomistic level on the mechanism of hydrogen 2S
spillover and are fully consistent with experimental observations. For instance, Panayotov and 7S
Yates [62] demonstrated in a study of hydrogen spillover on Au/TiO2 that the rate of spillover : &

is proportional to Pi, indicating that the H atoms originate from the equilibrium dissociative
adsorption of H2 on the Au particle. Furthermore, the diffusion of H atoms into the oxide is
accompanied by the formation of trapped electrons in shallow trap states near the bottom of the
CB edge [62]. Also the recent experimental-theoretical work of Karim et al. [53] is fully consistent
with the present conclusions.
