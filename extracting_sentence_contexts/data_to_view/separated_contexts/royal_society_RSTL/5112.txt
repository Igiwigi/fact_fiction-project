'=according to the generally received opinion, a centre of motor power only, destined

Lfor the control and coordination of complex muscular movements, it would follow

Sthat these columns were motor, and not sensitive, whether or not we admit them to

Z be constituted wholly, or in part, of the longitudinal fibres of the posterior roots*.

AQ Upon anatomical grounds, then, it would appear, that the posterior white columns
are not, the channels of communication between the sensorium and the posterior
spinal nerves. Experimental evidence tends to the same conclusion. Both Van
Deen and STiLLING found that irritation of these columns excited no sensation

* That the cerebellum is in 8ome way coucerned in the regulation and coordination of muscular movements
appears to follow from experiment and pathological investigation ; but I think there are reasons for believing
that the mode of action usually assigned to it is unsatisfactory, and at variance with many well-established facts. The discussion of this question, however, would be foreign to the present subject. + Trait6s et Decouvertes sur la Physiologie de la Moelle Epinizre.
