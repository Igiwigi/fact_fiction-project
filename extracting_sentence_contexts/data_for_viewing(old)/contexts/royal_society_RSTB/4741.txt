56 MR. H. ONSLOW ON A PERIODIC STRUCTURE IN MANY INSECT SCALES,

so long as it was moist, no pressure that could be exerted had the slightest effect on
the colour. It was at first thought that this similarity to beetles that always remain
golden might be due to the thickness of the wing-case. A moist wing was, therefore,
polished, to see whether the effect would be like that observed in Plusiotis resplendens
(see p. 31). No matter at what depth the surface was exposed, so long as the wing
was kept moist, the colour, strange to say, did not vanish. In fact, a piece of wing-
case was polished until its end was ground to the form of a sharp chisel, exposing the
entire thickness of the chitin. As soon as this was moistened with any fluid it became
intensely metallic and golden. This piece was mounted in glycerol and examined
microscopically, when it was seen that not only was the surface golden, but any cracks
in other planes were metallic also, as if carved out of solid gold. Clearly it is a
property of the whole mass of the chitin that is here being dealt with. The chitin is
stained with a diffuse yellow pigment, and its nature is such that if the surface is
polished and moist, it reflects an intense metallic surface colour, much in the same
way that the dull brown pebbles glisten with brilliant colours when a wave from the
rising tide washes the beach. When moist, the surface cuticle acts as a protection,
maintaining the iridescence ; when dry, it prevents the access of moisture. ‘This is
the reason why the wing-cases require to soak an appreciable time before they regain
