They form no parallel to the cases mentioned
above of the rudimentary formation of an entire series of teeth of the temporary or
milk-set,

To return to the Marsupials :—Tf this view be correct, T should be quite prepared to
find, in phases of development earlier than those yet examined, some traces either of
the papillary, follicular, or saccular stages of milk-predecessors to other of the teeth
besides those determinate four in which, for some unexplained reason, they arrive at &
more mature growth+. Such proof as this would alone decide the truth of these specu-
lations; and I have not at present either the requisite leisure or materials for following
out 80 delicate an investigation. I trust that the facts already elicited are sufficiently
novel and important to justify my bringing them, as they now stand, before the Society.

+ It may be remarked that the milk-tooth which alone is developed in the Marsupials corresponds homolo-
gically with that which, as a general rule, is most persistent in the typical diphyodonts, including Man, viz. the
posterior milk-molar, replaced by the posterior permanent premolar.
