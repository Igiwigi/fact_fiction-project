the monthly means for successive years do not manifest the same accordance ; as in
the tide just noticed the smallest mean oscillation is in the monsoon months, and it
increases until December—January, and then decreases to June—July. In 1828, how-
ever, June is a remarkable exception, the oscillation being greater than in any month
of the year excepting January, and nearly double that of June 1827. Dr. WaLkeR
at Mahabuleshwar, at 4500 feet, found the rise from sunrise to 9—10 a.m. to be nearly
identical (0476, thermometer +4©18) with my rise at less than 2000 feet. Mr. Dar.-
Manovy at Kotagherry, at 6407 feet, found the rise from sunrise to noon to be 0490,
thermometer +104 ; and had his observations been taken at the hour of the maxi-
mum diurnal tide (9—10 a.m.), the oscillation would no doubt have exceeded those
recorded by Dr. WaLkeR and myself at infinitely lower levels. Mr. GoLpinNGnam at
the Observatory at Madras, a little above the level of the sea, makes this tide amount
to *0470 ; 80 that, in fact, it is less at the level of the sea than at 6407 feet !

The nocturnal rising tide from 4—5 ».y. to 10—11 e.. I observed with great care
for eleven months continuously in 1830. It amounted to :0884, thermometer —7*2.
The indications of monsoon influence in this tide are scarcely perceptible. Indeed,
the smallest monthly mean oscillation occurs in December, 0450, thermometer —6*3 ;
and the greatest in May, *1140, thermometer —9*0. Unlike the preceding tides, we
cannot trace a maximum in the coldest months, and a minimum in the most rainy.
Dr. Wares found it to amount to 0439, thermometer —5%58 ; the monthly mean
maximum oscillation, 0632, thermometer —3*21, being in November, and the mini-
mum, *0291, thermometer —6*:74, in January. Mr. Daimanor, at 6407 feet, found it to
be *0430, the minimum, 0280, being in June, and the maximum, 0560, in April; but
as he did not determine the exact period of the time of the tide between 9-—12 p.m.,
