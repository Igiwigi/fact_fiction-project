(v) Normative feldspars. In fig. 8 are shown the composition of the normative
plagioclase of the analysed rocks of Montserrat and the ratio of potash feldspar to
plagioclase feldspar, in accordance with Niggli’s graphical method (Niggli 1927). It will be seen that the normative plagioclase of the rocks is somewhat less basic than
the abundant modal labradorite phenocrysts; this is of course due to the fact that
much of the albitic plagioclase is in the groundmass of the rocks. The diagram shows at a glance two of the most outstanding features of the rocks of
the Lesser Antilles—the abundance of lime-rich plagioclase in relatively siliceous rocks,
and the unusually small potash content. Fig. 8 also shows part of the “fields” for the
normative plagioclase of the Mexican volcanic province (Burri 1930) and of the
Tertiary and Recent volcanic rocks of the Sierra Nevada (including Lassen Peak) and
Nicaragua (Burri and Sonder 1936).
