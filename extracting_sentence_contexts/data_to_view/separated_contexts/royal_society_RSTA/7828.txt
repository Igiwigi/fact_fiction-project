This, no doubt,
is sometimes legitimate, but it is certainly not so for o’ = 9 — 11, in each of which two
branches are unresolved throughout, with the consequent probability of serious
systematic error. This will be greatest when it is the P and R branches which are
superposed, since the errors of the two are bound to be opposite in sign and therefore
additive when the combination differences are taken. The band v' = 10, in which
the P and R branches are unresolved, does, in fact, show the largest discrepancy. The
values of B’ showed, as usually, an approximately linear variation with v’, but again
there were pronounced irregularities. In order to examine the nature of these more
closely, the two sets of differences between successive values of B were plotted.
