Þ-ace or a p-gon can be reduced by single vanescences to the (p+1)-edral pyramid. R

In the second of the aboye three 8-edra, the first pair, though at first sight it appears
a vanescible pair, is not 0. For putting s, and F, for the summit and face signed 2, we
5ee in the eighth and second pairs, or the nodal pairs, $ in f;, and s, in f;, 8, in fa, and
% inf,, Ifnow 314,44; evanesces, we have f,=f,, whence, s, is in f, through 8, and s,
in f, through s,, 80 that 3,4,444; is no longer convanescible, f; and , through s, and s,
being covertical, and in fact collateral faces. REV. T.
