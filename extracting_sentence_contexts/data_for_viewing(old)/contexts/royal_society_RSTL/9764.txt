Fe are not in a position to pronounce upon this hypothesis. The fact that resistance
5 higher with increased degree of exhaust, after a certain point is passed, s8eems to
Seo it, as this law would then admit of the simple explanation that the resistance was
\Feater because of the lack of carriers to carry the electricity into the gaseous medium.
Sub this increase of resistance may come from other causes, and this single considera-
"gon does not seem to be sufficient ground for assigning to the molecular streams such
-S6pecial function in the absence of other evidence thab they possess it.

On the whole, then, we are inclined to doubt whether molecular streams have any
- 1ecexrary function in the discharge. This does not, of course, imply that the molecules
— hat compose them are not charged. On the contrary, it seems very probable thab
hey are, as it would otherwise be difficult to account for their being shot off at 80 great
+» velocity or ſor their obeying a magnet. But the fact that in this way 8ome 8mall
© »ortion of the negative discharge is convectively carried along the tube would no more
- mtitle them to.be looked upon as having a funetion to perform in the discharge than
would entitle the particles of lamp-black to be looked upon in that light.
