Therefore, v is a subsolution to the parabolic problem (3.1). The next key observation is that
the eigenfunction Q(x) behaves like a constant multiple of the distance function dist(x, I") as x
approaches the boundary 1”. Namely, since the operator M~ is concave, the solution is C? [47,48]
and the Hopf lemma —dy@1 > 0 holds (e.g. lemma 2.1 in [43]). Therefore, function v behaves like
cdist(x, °)e~*1! as x approaches the boundary I" for some constant c. Here dist(x, ”) denotes the
distance function to the boundary I". We first want to show that for any arbitrarily small time
o > 0, there exists a strictly positive constant 5(7) > 0 such that q — dv is a positive supersolution
to the parabolic problem (3.1) on the time interval [o, T).

Since v is a subsolution and q is a solution, it follows that for any 6 > 0,q — vis asupersolution.
The positivity of q — 5v at t=o follows from the parabolic Hopf lemma, from which we infer the
existence of a constant 5(o) such that q/v > 5(o) uniformly over . Note that we have used the
fact that v(o, x) behaves like c x dist(x) near the boundary I" for some positive constant c. Thus
by the maximum principle, q — 6(a)v = 0 on [o, T). This implies

q(t, x) = 5(a) v(t, x) = CS(c) dist(x, I) et te [o,T),


which yields

_ Oq(t, x)

oN >Ci(cye*!, te [o,T).

The above estimate is however not yet satisfactory, as the constant 5(0) may degenerate as o goes
