K1aarscu (14), in investigating the teeth of Australians,
was keenly alive to the possibility of discovering some trace of a diastema in the
upper jaw or some modification in the lower premolar in adaptation to a large upper
canine, but he very definitely states that he was unable to detect either of these
features in all the skulls examined by him. The evidence furnished by the upper
canine and first premolar teeth in the Talgai jaw points clearly to the presence of this
modification of the lower first premolar and canine, in conjunction with a large upper
canine tooth, as in the skulls of young anthropoids. In view of these facts, the
reconstruction shown in fig. 7 is the one which is most consistent and portrays a
human dentition in which these anthropoid characters are manifested in a manner
quite unknown in man, except for the single example of Hoanthropus. Fic. 7.—Reconstruction of Talgai Skull. The reconstruction of the cranium is very hypothetical, and
has been arrived at by comparison with the Australian cranium shown in fig. 25.
