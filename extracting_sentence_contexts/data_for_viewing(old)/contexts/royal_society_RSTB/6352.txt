At the present time it cannot be maintained that real chemical accuracy is possible with this method,
though the ultimate aims of histologists, in using microincineration, appear to lie in the direction of
making inorganic analyses of individual cells and tissues. To take an individual cell and to hope to
define the exact regions of the cytoplasm where certain inorganic elements are located after incinera-
tion is not to be expected ; only approximate results on a few of the inorganic constituents of
protoplasm can be obtained. The ease with which ions may migrate from one portion of a cell to
another during any type of histological fixation, except possibly with the freezing-drying procedure,
is sufficient to justify extreme caution.

After incineration, the identification of individual ions in the ash rests, at present, on a few simple
chemical tests and a series of assumptions based upon the colour of the ash deposit as seen principally
by dark ground illumination, Chemically speaking, the colour values indicate little apart from the
fact that thick clumps of ash, containing calcium, are likely to be whitish in appearance and may be
mixed with traces of magnesium, silicon, and aluminium. Relatively large concentrations of iron
may impart a reddish hue of iron oxide to ash in which it is mixed. This iron can be seen readily
in the developing nervous system of the chick, as described by Horninc and Scorr (1932). In
individual cells, particularly in erythrocytes, the iron can be detected with less certainty, though it
undoubtedly gives a yellow-reddish coloration in the ash of clumped masses of blood cells.

Cowpry (1933) in reference to a paper by Mason, qualifies the opinion that sodium may be
identified “‘ by its bluish-white sheen” as being probably caused by physical and not chemical
properties. Deposits of ash, of known chemical composition, which may be obtained by evaporating
a solution of Ca,PQ, on a glass slide, followed by incineration, show a gradation in colour from blue
to bluish-white and even to opaque white ; a phenomenon obviously depending upon the amount
of ash present in any particular area of the preparation. Sufficiently finely deposited KH,PO, will
