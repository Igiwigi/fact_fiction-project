672 MR. CHARLES TOMLINSON ON SUPERSATURATED SALINE SOLUTIONS,

Potassic chlorate, potassic ferrocyanide, baric nitrate, and plumbic nitrate gave 8imilar

results. Ammonium-nitrate solution gave apparently some signs of supersaturation ; but the
observation is liable to error from the fact that at high temperatures ammonia is given
off. According to KARSTEN, 100 parts of water at 645 F. dissolve 199-54 parts of the
salt. A hot solution (2 salt to 1 water) was filtered into a clean flask moistened with
a few drops of tig.
