and V, KARMAN,

CALLENDAR has drawn our attention to one important difficulty of the quantum
theory which is mentioned by ExnstTEry, namely, that for large values of e*!", but
a small proportion of the atoms could have even one quantum, When /)/T = 3 (as
for iron at T = 130°C. abs., but one molecule in twenty could have a single
quantum. Even at 100°C. it would be only one in three. PxancK has
endeavoured to avoid this by a more recent and artificial proof which has not
received much support.

Before proceeding to consider the other theories of specific heat, we will beiefly
compare the experimental results with the formule based on PLanck’s “ quantum”
theory. Drpye’s equation (16) is acknowledged, for the representation of the facts
at low temperature, to be superior to the formule of Exystery and of Nernst and
LINDEMANN, but we find that no single value of the limit frequency will make the
formula fit the experimental results over the complete range.

It is at very low temperatures that the assumption made by Drpys, namely, that
the vibrations whose frequency is greater than y,, are negligible, can best be justified,
since at such temperatures the slow heat vibrations would be the most important.
Hence, in the following comparison, the value of »,, is so chosen that DeByer’s equation
fits the results over the lowest portion of the range.

Tt is of but little use to calculate the appropriate values of »y,, from the elastic
constants of the metals, since these constants are considerably influenced by the
