CARBON DIOXIDE AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES. 219

oil gauge was measured, since this pressure difference varied slightly according as the
bell was rising or falling, owing to the viscosity of the oil. In some cases the mean of
the readings with the bell very slowly rising and very slowly falling was taken.
After H had been measured, the taps associated with the oil gauge were turned so as
to cause it to record the excess pressure at the high pressure ends of the tubes over
that of the atmosphere, in the manner described on p. 208.

It may be thought that since it was impossible to keep the bell quite still during
the passage of the gas from the reservoir to the bell an error might arise, owing to
the motion of the bell affecting the pressure, and consequently the flow, in virtue of
the viscosity of the oil in the pressure regulator. The fact that the bell was in the
same position when both times were recorded, however, insured, as will be seen from
the following consideration, that no error arose from this cause, even though the
motion of the bell might be quite irregular. For let f be the deviation of the rate of
flow of the gas from its normal value* owing to the fluctuations in pressure, p the
deviation of the pressure of the gas in the bell from its normal value, owing to the
motion of the bell. Over the small range of pressure considered we may assume f
proportional to p, say f= cp. If we assume that the frictional force on the bell was
proportional to the velocity for the small velocities under consideration, we have
po dy/dt, where y is the displacement of the bell from the position in which S touched
the lever. Hence f= ¢,dy/dt, ¢, being a constant. If ¢, and t, refer to the two
times at which the contact was broken, we have for the total error in the flow during
the experiment,
