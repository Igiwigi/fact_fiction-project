out during the run. Now, the freezing-point of the hydrate H,SO,1Aq is higher
than 0° C., hence when the pure acid in the first branch takes up enough water
to form a liquid of that concentration it solidifies, but the addition of more water will
lower the freezing-point. The difficulty, therefore, was overcome by filling this first
branch, at the start, with an 85-per cent. solution of sulphuric acid, 7.¢., a solution

slightly weaker than H,SO,1 Aq.
Osmotic EquiLtiprium PRESSURES.

The equilibrium pressures were determined in exactly the same way as described in
‘Phil. Trans.,’ A, vol. 206, pp. 481-507.

It is only necessary, before giving a table of the results, to call attention to the fact
that in all cases the ‘ solution-leak correction,” that is, the amount of calcium ferro-
cyanide which came through the membrane during the experiment, is practically
negligible. The amount coming through was determined by evaporating the water
contents of the tubes together with 100 ¢.c. washing water passed through the tube
after an interval of four days, down to a small bulk, and determining the calcium in
it by the oxalate method.

It should be mentioned that the solutions act on the gunmetal of the osmotic
apparatus ; this was prevented by coating the metal with a varnish.

In Table IIL, Column (1) gives the date of the experiment; (2) the weight
concentration (i.e., the number of grammes of anhydrous salt to 100 grammes of
