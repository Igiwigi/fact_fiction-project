The line (6) shows that there are 8
asyzygetic covariants of the degree 6, viz. one of the order 18, this is U*; one of the
order 14, this is U*H ; one of the order 12, this is U*Þ; one of the order 10, this is

PH; one of the order 8, this is UH®; two of the order 6 (7. e. the three covariants
H?, Þ? and VU? are not asyzygetic, but are connected by a single linear equation or
syzygy), and one of the order 2, this is VH. We are thus led to the irreducible
covariants U, H, ©, Y connected by a linear equation or syzygy between I, Þ* and
V1, and this is in fact the complete system of irreducible covariants; V is therefore
the only invariant.

36. The asyzygetic covariants are of the form U”H'V", or else of the form
U”H'V'®; and since U, H, V are of the degrees 1, 2, 4 respectively, and ® is of the
degree 3, the number of asyzygetic covariants of the degree m of the first form is
equal to the coefficient of a” in 1+(1—2)(1—a)(1—2"), and the number of the
asyzygetic covariants of the degree m of the second form is equal to the coefficient
of a” in a*+(1—a)(1—4)(1—z"). Hence the total number of asyzygetic covariants
is equal to the coefficient of a” in (1+) +(1—2)(1—2*)(1—2"), or what is the
same thing, in

1=2)1=2)(1=#(1—z9) *

and conversely, if this expression for the number of the asyzygetic covariants of
the degree m2 were established independently, it would follow that the irreducible
invariants were four in number, and of the degrees 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively, but con-
nected by an equation of the degree 6.
