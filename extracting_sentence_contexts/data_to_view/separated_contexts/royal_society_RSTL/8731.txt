Considered as a segment this answers to the short © interstapedial ” of the Frog (op. ct.
plate viii. fig. 9, .st.). But that which forms the main bar in the Frog, the © medio-stapedial,” is here one
fourth only the length of the proximal piece, and is a very small cylindrical bone. The
two bones fit close together, and the end piece leaves much cartilage unossfied—a 8oft-
ended * symplectic.” The soft part bends at right angles upon the little © medio-sta-

is the *extrastapedial” (e.st.). This plate, which has some calcified patches, sends
upwards and backwards from its inner face a band of cartilage which coalesces with the
tegmen tympani; this is the * suprastapedial ” (s.8/.). In the Grey Frog this part does
not, coalesce above ; in the Bull-frog it does.
