216 DR. GLADSTONE ON CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFYING

till of the same volume as the first portion, It was far deeper in colour, indicating
evidently that the insolubility of sulphate of potash in alcohol had-removed it out of
the sphere of action, and had caused a much larger proportion of ferric sulphocyanide
to be formed than would otherwise have been produced. Only a small quantity of
alcohol was employed, and it was mixed with a large amount of water in order to ob-
viate as much as possible the objection that the same amount, of ferric sulphocyanide
might appear darker in alcoholic than in aqueous soJution, which is indeed the fact.

II. Another red s0lution was prepared by mixing sulphocyanide of potassium and
ferric sulphate, and it was divided into two equal portions. To one of these hydro-
chloric acid was added, which of course reduced the colour 80mewhat. To each was
then added an equal portion of neutral phosphate of 80da. The acid solation remained
red, though paler than before; the neutral solution became colourless, and turbid
from the formation of a flocculent precipitate of ferric phosphate. That the insolu-
bility of this salt in the neutral solution was the cause of the complete combination
of the oxide of iron with the phosphorie acid, was further elucidated by adding phos-
phoric acid to the colourless mixture, which restored a faint red tint to the 80lution,
doubtless because it had set free some of the sulphuric acid, which, redissolving the
ferric phosphate, allowed of the formation of a small amount of the red sulpho-
