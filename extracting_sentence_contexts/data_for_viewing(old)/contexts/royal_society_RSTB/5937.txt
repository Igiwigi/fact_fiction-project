M. SNOW AND R. SNOW: EXPERIMENTS ON PHYLLOTAXIS. 373

experiments in which I,k was imperfect, P, was “ medium,” “ large” or “ very large,”
and in the fifth its size was not recorded, so that it is probable that in all five experiments
the operation was made in the latter half of the plastochron. Now in section 7 it was
suggested that the I,a bracts arose when the operations were made towards the end of the
plastochron, and that they were formed by the incomplete reorganization of part of the
presumptive area of I,, the operation having been made at a time when the leaf-forming
processes had proceeded so far that they could not be completely arrested. Similarly
it is now suggested that in the present experiments the five imperfect I,k leaves were
also formed partly by reorganization and not as completely new leaves, since there is
evidence that the operations were made towards the end of the plastochron. This
suggestion is supported by the fact that in another series of experiments, already
mentioned, in which P, was split in half, similar imperfect leaves were often formed if
the cut was non-median. Usually the larger half of P, gave rise to an imperfect leaf,
and the smaller half to a bract.

But with regard to the experiments on L,, if the imperfect leaves and the bracts both
resulted from operations made late in the plastochron, the question remains how it
was that the five imperfect leaves were all on the kathodic side of the wound, whereas
five bracts out of a total of six were on the anodic side. This may indeed have been
only a coincidence, but it is probably significant, and an explanation can be suggested.
But first it is necessary to consider certain relevant observations collected in Table V.
This table includes all the experiments so far reported in which imperfect leaves or
bracts arose, except one in which the bract was not measured: it also includes one
