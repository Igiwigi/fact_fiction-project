This beneficial allele arose on different haplotypes in the two
builds support for the case that adaptation was probably adapted populations and, after fixation, we observe high

owing to selection on the same mutation, i.e. independent selection is owing to the fact that variants linking the ben-
adaptive allele frequency change on the same variant (inde- eficial allele also increased in frequency. As we move
pendent substitutions but not independent mutations), may further away from the selected locus, recombination is more
