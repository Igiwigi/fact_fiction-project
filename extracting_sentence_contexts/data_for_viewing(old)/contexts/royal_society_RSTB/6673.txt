related to knowledge or experience of a normal unparasitized gipsy moth egg. The
essential feature of the preceding experiments is the synthetic relating activity of the
female parasite; this activity integrates the sense data so that the objects are perceived
as wholes and at the same time has reference to future conditions such as the develop-
ment of the parasite in the host. In the series above, the selection by the ovipositing
female of those hosts containing the younger parasite stages becomes understandable
when we find that she usually chooses unparasitized hosts in preference to parasitized
ones, and that these gipsy moth eggs only contain sufficient food material for one
Ooencyrtus to develop to maturity. The female’s activity now acquires a meaning—she
is selecting as her hosts those in which her progeny are most likely to develop, though
she herself has no knowledge of the outcome of this action.

The fact that animals may respond, not to simple physico-chemical stimuli, but to
perceptual complexes, that is, to things perceived in their relation to one another, is
now widely recognized by a large school of workers on animal behaviour (Bierens de
Haan 1929; Russell 1932, 1934). Kohler (1915), one of many workers on “relative
choice”, has shown that hens can be trained to pick corn from one of two grey papers
of different tints, for instance, the lighter of the two. If the papers be replaced by
another pair, of which the one to which the hen had been trained is now the darker
of the two, the hen still chooses the lighter of the pair; that is, the response is to a
relation. It has been maintained (Hempelmann 1929) that instinct is merely a con-
catenation of reflexes, but that the grasping of the objective inner relationship between
two things such as occurs with the hen is a performance superior to instinctive action.
And yet from one point of view the behaviour in both hen and parasite is essentially
similar. If a female is confronted with a choice of hosts parasitized with a parasite
