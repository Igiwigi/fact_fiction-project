Actually, the notion of what constitutes a mathematical proof has changed
over time [19] and is not a matter of consensus [20,21]. Bleiler-Baxter & Pair [22, p. 16] follow
de Villiers’s [23] point of view and define proof as ‘logical deduction that is used to verify,
explain, systematize, discover, and communicate mathematics’ (including both the proof as a
written argument and the act of proving). Steele & Rogers [21, p. 161], inspired by previous
work by other authors, define proof as ‘a mathematical argument that is general for a class of
mathematical ideas and establishes the truth of a mathematical statement based on mathematical
facts that are accepted or have been previously proven’. Tall [24, p. 93] notes, ‘though proof is the
central idea of modern mathematics, quite what it is is a matter of implicit, rather than explicit,
agreement between members of the mathematics community’. And Smith [19, p. 75] observes that


proof is often assumed to be ‘a convincing argument’, and that what is accepted as convincing is
determined by the experts, the teacher or the textbook.
