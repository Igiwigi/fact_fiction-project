them in the description of the complex interactions between a pandemic and society.

Various key topics should be considered in the modelling approach. For instance, but not only,
origin and mutations of the virus [1,2], RNA virus evolution [3], contagion dynamics [4], immune
competition [5], search for vaccines and vaccination programs [6,7]. A description of the overall
dynamics is delivered in [8] and in [9] which is going to be the main reference for our present
article.

Once installed in the infected individual, corona viruses attack the lungs, but in some cases
other organs, and are able to evade some mechanisms of the immune defense. Therefore, the
modelling approach should also consider the role of the immune system in the complex dynamics
under consideration from the innate to the activated immunity [10,11]. The role of immune
competition is decisive and attention to this competition is also motivated by the fact that
infectivity and onset of variants depend on the viral charge as well as on the number of infected
individuals. In addition, it is necessary to account for the dynamics of the in-host immune
competition that develops when the presence of viral particles releases danger signals which
activates the reaction of the hostâ€™s innate immunity.

The need for science to respond to the worldwide situation has generated a broad variety of
research contributions. For instance, various topics on the biology of the virus are reported in
[4,12,13]. A great part of research activity in mathematics has produced a large number of articles
devoted to developments of the original SIR types models [14]. Without claiming to provide
an exhaustive survey, we mention [15] which shows how SIR models can be transferred into
compartmental models, so-called SEIR models, accounting for a variety of complexity features of
the interactions and typology of the population within the general framework described in [8].
