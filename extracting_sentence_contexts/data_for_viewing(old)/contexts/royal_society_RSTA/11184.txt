was not important in the case of salts of the alkali metals on account of their ready
volatility.

In our experiments we noticed this effect, but we believe that in our apparatus with
the salts used by us it was fully accounted for by the fact that after the spray of salt
had been replaced by one of water, salt spray lingered for some time in the apparatus
between the sprayer and the flame tube. We noticed that the flame remained coloured
below the electrodes, and that as the colour faded the galvanometer deflection fell
steadily to the normal value. We have therefore used the normal value as the true
correction. Even if our explanation of the higher value, found immediately after
stopping the salt spray, is incomplete, the arbitrariness in our case of taking any other
value than the normal one as the correction, would forbid us attempting further
refinement, where, as a matter of fact, the difference involved could not seriously
atfect our final results.

Unipolar Conduction.

It has long been known that unipolar conduction is shown to a marked extent in
the case of flame gases, that is to say the current passes from one electrode to the
other more easily in one direction than in the reverse direction. The following table

*ScHaLLer has shown (‘ Zeit. Phys. Chem.,’ 25, 497, 1898) that pure water acts so rapidly on glass
vessels as to forbid their use in conductivity experiments, but that with salt solutions, even of very small
concentration, the solvent action is not sufficient to introduce sensible error,
