Gables XI. and XIII. corroborate this sufficiently well, especially when it is
remembered that the stations are not quite equatorial, and that the obliquity of the
magnetic axis also produces a disturbing effect. A further interesting consequence
of the above equations is to indicate that at the equator the terms in X which
depend on sind, 7.e., the seasonal terms in the horizontal force variation, vanish. This agrees with the known fact that at tropical stations the X variation hardly
changes throughout the year. Table XII. illustrates this, especially for the most
nearly equatorial observatory, Batavia (6Â° S.). For comparison with observation we shall write down the values of the ratios
of the amplitudes of the first, third, and fourth harmonic components to that of the
