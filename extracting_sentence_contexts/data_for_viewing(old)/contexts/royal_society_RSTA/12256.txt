Tn all the stars included in this Table there is a very considerable amount of
continuous absorption in the violet, extending to about G. Long exposures are
therefore required, in order that their spectra may be photographed. The brightest
star in the Table is « Orionis, and even this requires an exposure of 35 minutes with
the instrument A to give a spectrum one-tenth of an inch wide, extending to the K
line. With the 30-inch reflector and slit spectroscope, an exposure of one hour is
barely sufficient. It is accordingly a matter of considerable difficulty to photograph
the spectra of these stars, as most of them are below the third magnitude.

Characteristics of the Spectra.

Notwithstanding the fact that the visual spectra of these stars are characterised by
conspicuous flutings, the region more refrangible than F consists almost entirely of
dark lines. Indeed the only indication of flutings in this region in any of the stars
Tamed are near wave-lengths 4763 and 4585, and these vary in intensity in the
different stars. The flutings are stronger in « Herculis than in any of the other stars
in the Table, as will be seen on reference to Plate 26, and they are still stronger in the
Spectrum of Mira Ceti, as seen in a photograph kindly forwarded to me by Professor
Picxrrivc. So far as the line spectrum is concerned, « Orionis may be taken as a
type of the remainder. Lines of hydrogen, iron, manganese, calcium, chromium,
cobalt, titanium, and strontium are common to them all. The calcium lines, it will
be seen, are considerably intensified as compared with the corresponding lines seen in

_ the solar spectrum. This applies also to the lines of chromium and manganese, so
