TWO TYPES OF DIAMOND. 493

source and neocyanine plates, but no Raman lines originating from these wave-lengths
were found even after 60 hours’ exposure.

At low temperatures.

In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is unaltered at the temperature of
liquid oxygen, it was important to examine the Raman spectrum likewise at this tempera-
ture. Diamond D 1 was fitted into a Dewar vessel similar to that shown in fig. 6 (b), the
radiation, being condensed on the face of the diamond, and that scattered at right angles
being collected by the spectrograph. Suitable diaphragms were arranged around the
diamond in order to prevent stray radiation being reflected into the spectrograph.

REsutts.
Tn the course of this work we have observed (a) Raman lines, (6) a diffuse band, and
(c) a region of continuous spectrum.

(a) Raman lines.
Nine diamonds, 4 of Type 1 and 5 of Type 2 (see Table I, marked “ R”) were examined
