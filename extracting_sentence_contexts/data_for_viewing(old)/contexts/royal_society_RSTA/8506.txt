they mark a great advance. They are also in general agreement with fig. 17 of the
present paper, but in points of detail they are considered inferior to this for the following
reasons :—

1. DeFant’s data appear to be much inferior.

2. He does not use coastal elevations in the determination of open-sea elevations,
but relies entirely on the rough current data.

3. His processes are essentially those of differentiation, whereas those of the present
paper are essentially integrations.

Of course the fact noted as No. 2 is a strong argument in favour of the applicability
of the fundamental equations used both by Durant and in the present paper.

3. Qualitative explanation of the North Sea Tides.

The tides of any body of water are dynamically determinate when either the elevations
or the normal currents are known along the sections of the channels which connect the
body with other waters. But the numerical details of the necessary calculations have
been carried out, up to the present, only for such natural basins as have very small
transverse currents.

We suppose that we have given the M, currents normal to two bounding sections,
and find it convenient to take these bounding sections through the two outer amphi-
