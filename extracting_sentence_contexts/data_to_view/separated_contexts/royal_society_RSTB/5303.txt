Jones himself, however,
appeared doubtful whether his organism should be placed in the Plasmodiophorales,
and it seems to us a pity that a definite specific name should have been given to it at
that stage in the work. P. fici-repentis has also been described without a very critical examination, no cyto-
logical details being available, nor are any figures given illustrating the species. So
far as information is available, it would appear to be allied to P. brassicw, and in view
of the fact that it causes hypertrophy of the host cells the genus Plasmodiophora would
be the correct place to which to refer this new species. AND METHOD OF INFECTION OF PLASMODIOPHORA BRASSICZ. 305

Worontn does not give a precise diagnosis of the species which he described. So far
as we have been able to discover, the name Plasmodiophora brassice first appears in his
paper (67) in 1877.
