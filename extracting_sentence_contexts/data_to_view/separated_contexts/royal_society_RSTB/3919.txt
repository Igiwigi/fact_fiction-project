It was crosses in which E. miliaris was used as the female parent that showed
the changed inheritance.

3. While in previous years cross-fertilizations with H. miliaris gave uniformly
80 or 90 per cent. segmentation, in 1912 it was rare to obtain as much as 20 per cent.

4, In the only cross-fertilization of E. miliaris eggs which gave a high percentage
of fertilization in 1912, some of the hybrids had maternal characters.

5. Different cultures from one given fertilization always gave the same type of

inheritance. '
In addition to these reasons, our contention gains further support from the fact

that in not a single instance out of our numerous cultures during 1909-11 did the
type of inheritance show any change. If the inheritance in our larvee were of the
nature of that described by Tennent for Hipponoé and Toxopneustes, that is that it
can be influenced by some external condition, such as the reaction, salinity, and
temperature of the sea-water at the time of, or after fertilization, then it is remarkable
that in all these cultures, in many of which these conditions must have varied widely,
no stimulus should have been present capable of bringing about some change. The fact that no such change took place in any of these cultures lends a certain
amount of support to our belief that, whatever may have been the cause that brought
about the change of inheritance in 1912, it was one that acted on the germ cells
during their period of growth and maturation, and not at the time of fertilization or
afterwards.
