The cylinder of wood as it becomes gradually
immersed *, continually furnishes an equiyalent to the repulsion, in the quan-
tity of water displaced. We do not generally perceive the attractive effect resulting from this indue-
tive action in non-ferruginous masses; for, as already observed, their feeble
retentive power admits of the magnetic neutrality being more rapidly restored,
when the tension passes a certain point. So that in fact, the opposite magnetic
state never becomes sufficiently intense to evince an attractive force, cogni-
zable by the ordinary means. * Amore detailed account of this experiment may be found in the Transactions of the Royal Society
of Edinburgh.
