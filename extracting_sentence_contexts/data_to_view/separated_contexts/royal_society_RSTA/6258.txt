In the mixed-system BepMg12_ O12 (n= 1,...,11) shown in figures 4 and 5, we again observed
combinations of a multitude of ring sizes. Here, we remark that, in contrast to the planar
Si/C system (figure 3), we did not observe 5- or 7-rings. This is presumably due to the fact
that (a) the number of atoms inside the simulation cell was not large enough, and, more
likely, (b) the positively charged Be and Mg ions prefer to establish isotropic surroundings by
negatively charged oxygen ions in their nearest neighbourhood. In turn, these anions try to form
a dense packing on the surface of the cylinder, which does not favour odd-numbered rings. Furthermore, a cylinder surface has zero mean curvature, and thus—in contrast to a sphere
(c.f. the 12 pentagons in the C9 molecule)—we do not need to introduce 5-rings into a perfect
hexagon-network, to fulfil Euler’s rule.
