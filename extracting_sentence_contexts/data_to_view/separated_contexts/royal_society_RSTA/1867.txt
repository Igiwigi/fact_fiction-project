Both represent such fundamentally important discoveries that they spawned the development
of new disciplines devoted to defining the underlying principles, but at the same time they had
opposing properties. The periodic table was a logical amalgamation of empirical facts in search
of a theory. Evolution was a theory built on an amalgamation of facts, but evolution itself awaited
empirical verification. Another point of similarity between the periodic table and the theory of evolution is they were
both predictive but not perfectly so because they were shaped by an incomplete knowledge of
their subject. Mendeleev did not know about the existence of subatomic particles and mistakenly
arranged the first periodic table strictly by atomic weight, which implied that something about
the atomic weights dictated the chemical properties of the element.
