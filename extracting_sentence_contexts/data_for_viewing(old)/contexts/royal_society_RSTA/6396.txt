(a) Result: the synergy between tactic induction and curricula 1S

We now evaluate whether this induced curriculum would help a second agent learn faster. [3
Intuitively, when solving problems in a random order, the first agent takes many samples to :3
accumulate evidence that a certain abstraction is useful, and time is wasted attempting problems
that are either too hard (require abstractions several levels above its current tactics) or too easy
(e.g. solved within a single step given its current tactics). Thus, the fact that the learner is
performing tactic induction provides a strong reason why a curriculum might be helpful.

To train a second agent using a curriculum, we first sample one of the valid topological orders
on all problems solved by the first agent. Then, we split the resulting sequence of problems into
three blocks. When sampling problems for the second agent, we initially only sample problems
from the first block, until training success rate reaches a minimum of 90%, at which point we
include the second block in the pool of problems, and again include the third block once the
agent reaches a success rate of 90% when solving the last batch of problems. This schema matches
a well-known definition of a training curriculum [36]: a function that assigns weights to training
examples at each iteration in such a way that, at the end of training, sampling from the reweighted
distribution is equivalent to sampling from the original target distribution, but examples might
be gradually introduced throughout training.
