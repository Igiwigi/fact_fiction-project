The yalues 80 obtained for the percentage
decrement do not differ very much from one another. In calculating the results for the iron alloys, Pc has not been taken equal to 29-307,
but for each alloy Pc has had to be calculated. Thus for the 1st, iron-gold, which
contains 27:93 yolumes per cent. iron,

The conducting-power of 1 volume of iron may be said to lose between 0? and

100* 38-260 per cent. ; therefore 02793 yolume will lose . . . . . . 10-686
That of 1 volume of gold may be said to lose between 0* and 100” 29-307 per
cent. ; therefore 07207 yolume will lo . . . . - + + + + + - 21122

1 volume of iron-gold alloy, containing 27-93 per cent. iron, will therefore lose 31-808

On comparing the values obtained for the conducting-powers, &c. of the iron-gold
alloys, the following facts are worth mentioning,—their very low and almost identical
conducting-powers, and the high percentage decrements found for the first two and the
low one for the third. That there was no error in this value we convinced ourselves by
remaking the alloy, which contained, according to analysis, the same percentage amount
of iron as that given in the Table, and the percentage decrement in its conducting-power
was found equal to 4:04. Again, an alloy, made by a well-known firm *, which gave on
analysis 11:94 yolumes per cent. iron, conducted at 0* 2:097, and lost between 0* and
100* 4-30 per cent. of conducting-power.
