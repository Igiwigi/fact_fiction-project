This singular difference suggests the existence of robust
mechanisms underpinning the genesis of such patterns.

The question as to how patterns are formed is in fact at the crossroad of several fields, including
biology, chemistry, physics, theoretical mechanics, mathematics and computer science. Efforts to
rationalize their occurrence in nature date back to 1917, when D’Arcy Thompson published his
pioneering book On growth and form [1]. He unravelled some of the generic principles at work in
shaping living structures, e.g. the role played by surface tension in promoting area-minimizing
surfaces. He identified the link between growth and morphology, from shells to phyllotaxis, a
process later formalized and termed morphogenesis by Alan Turing [2], thereby creating a new
field since then thoroughly explored.

Patterns, seen as the regular organization of media via tilling, branching or folding, are not
exclusive to complex growing organisms and may be observed in mundane situations: when
eating Vienetta ice-cakes or when observing dewdrops arranging themselves regularly onto
spider webs (figure lef). In such cases, patterns are the direct result of a fluidic instability
