The animal used was a large-sized male mongrel terrier. Rate of movement 1 inch
3:3 8econds; arterial pressure 5 inches; respirations seventeen, pulzations seventy-six
minute. From the irregularity of the respiratory movements it is more difficult to
e out the relation between the two tracings, which, however, is in conformity with
vious observations. Those inspirations which were deepest and longest produced the
most marked effect *.

Observation VII.—June 20th, 1865.

The animal used was of the same description as in the Jast experiment. Rate of
ovement 1 inch in 3:3 seconds; arterial pressure 5 inches; respirations twenty to
enty-two, pulsations sixty per minute. In this animal the variations of arterial
were very slight; but as regards the diastolic intervals the facts of previous
servations were confirmedf.

Observation VIII.—June 17th, 1865.

Sd
SA female mongrel cur of moderate size was employed. Rate of movement 1 inch in
ree seconds; arterial pressure 5 inches ; twenty-one respirations and fifty-eight pulsa-
Zons per minute. In this animal the respiratory movements were unusually frequent as
mpared with the contractions of the heart. Occasionally the cardiac and respiratory
Hitervals are shown in the tracings to be nearly equal, in which case it is obyious that
Sie thoracic movements could not produce any effect on the variations of arterial pres-
Eire. If, however, the respiration was retarded, the usual variations manifested them-
