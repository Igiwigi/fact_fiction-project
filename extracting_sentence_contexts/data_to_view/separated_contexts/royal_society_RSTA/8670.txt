After
that the time of H.W. gets later as one goes further northwards up the coast. It
will be seen that from Carnsore Point to Wexford South Bay, therefore, the direction
of travel of the co-tidal line is just reversed. The fact that H.W. at Wexford South
Bay, which is well round Greenore Point, is actually earlier than H.W. at Tuskar
Rock which is south of Greenore Point, besides being 4 miles out at sea, is remark-
able. I do not know whether any explanation has been offered before of how it is
that the effect of a cape on the tidal phenomena in its neighbourhood is so very
different in different parts of the sea. Summary of Conelusions. (Added October 24, 1919.)

The rate of dissipation of energy at spring tides in the Irish Sea is calculated from
the known formule for skin-friction of the wind on the ground and the friction of
rivers on their beds.
