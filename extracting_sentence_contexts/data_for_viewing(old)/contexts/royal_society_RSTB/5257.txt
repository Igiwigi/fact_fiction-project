typical 5-angled form (see text-fig. 9, stem No. 6). Associated with each
dichotomy is an inevitable disturbance of the normal 2/5 phyllotaxis ; this is,
however, restored higher up, though very gradually. This and other questions
relating to the phyllotaxis will be discussed at a later stage.

Another remarkable fact is the extremely small angle of divergence in the
bifureating stem. This is clearly indicated by the serial sections drawn in

text-fig. 9; the sister axes lie almost parallel to each other, that is, practically
vertical, like the parent stem. ‘These are facts of importance in a reconstruction
of the plant, and are more fully considered below.

(Three sections have been prepared, two transverse and one longitudinal.)

Specimen 3 (No. 1089, Museum of Geology, University of Sydney).—This is the
largest specimen in the collection, with a cross-section 20 x 154 cm. and a
length of about 134 cm. It includes 11 leaf-bearing stems, two of which show
signs of bifurcation. The upper end has been cut level and polished, but no
transparent sections have been made. This specimen is not figured.

including a length of 6} cm. ; the polished upper end of the block, 14 x 64 cm.,
