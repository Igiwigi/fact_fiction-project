It was found that no
appreciable change in the measured normal stresses occurred. Again, we might anticipate that the presence of hole at one point of the base of the inner
cup would give rise to a wake which would, in turn, contribute to the surface traction at
another point of the base and hence introduce an error into the measurement of the normal
stress at that point. In order to test whether this did, in fact, occur, measurements were
made of the heights of rise in the manometers resulting from rotation of the outer cup with
various combinations of holes sealed to leave a smooth plane surface. Again, no changes
were observed in the measured normal stresses. It was therefore considered that the presence of holes of finite size in the base of the inner
cup did not influence the normal stresses significantly.
