THE STREAMERS IN THE ELECTRIC SPARK. 73

camera while keeping control of the shutter, it was possible to expose for the few
seconds required to just catch one or two good images on the plate and yet avoid the
confusion of many overlapping ones.

The appearance of the drawn-out spark obtained with a small inductance
(0Â°0001 henry) in circuit is shown in the photograph, fig. 1, Plate 2. We see the
initial air discharge extending straight across from pole to pole, and succeeding it the
streamers, starting from the poles and crossing each other in blurred masses in the
centre of the spark gap. The streamer corresponding to each oscillation is observed
to be much more prominent at one pole than at the other; this fact was noted both
by FrpprErsen and by ScuustTer and Hemsauecu, but they were unable to determine
from their photographs whether it was the positive or the negative pole from which
the main streamer started. ScHencK,* who subsequently investigated the spark by
means of a rotating mirror, observed that the streamers came from the cathode in each
case. HemMsALECH,f in a later research on the spark in which he separated the
oscillations by blowing a current of air across them, found that it was from the positive
pole that the streamers emanated. In each of my experiments the direction of the
first discharge of the spark was determined by noting the direction of the discharge
produced by the induction coil through an X-ray tube ; the nature of the poles in the
subsequent oscillations could then be easily ascertained by counting from the first
discharge. In all the photographs, which comprise different metals, inductances, and
capacities, and also different lines of the same element, I find, in agreement with
