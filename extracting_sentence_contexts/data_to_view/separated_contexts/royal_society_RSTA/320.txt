At the top level of the modified system is a single workflow that operates on every
available dataset. This workflow then initiates a new execution branch for each dataset that runs
concurrently to calculate descriptors and, ultimately, to construct and validate a set of models (the
workflow is shown in figure 2). The opportunities for parallelization in this system arise from the
fact that each set of data can be treated independently. Thus, when the first workflow completes,
there are several thousand independent workflow requests in the execution queue. To create this system, a number of additional workflow blocks were developed.
