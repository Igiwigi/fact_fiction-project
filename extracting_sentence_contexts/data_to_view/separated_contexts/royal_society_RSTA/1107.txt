In terms of the thermal impulse w,,
equation (2.25) reads
w(V,Wp — Vypwa) + W Qu =0, (2.33)

where Qy := VuT + Tu*V),u, is the auxiliary temperature gradient vector, see [3,59]. However, in
the numerical simulation, it is more convenient to use equation (2.25) for J,, and then compute
Wy using (2.27) because, after the 3 + 1 split, (2.25)2 has the same structure as the non-relativistic
SHTC heat conduction equation [8,9].

(v) The symmetry of the thermal stress

Let us now consider the question of symmetry of the energy-momentum. Thus, in new terms, the
thermal stress can be written as

Ju Ej, = —(Wy + Tuyp)(su” + Eo,) = —Wp Ew, + Tsuyu” + swyu? + TE, Up), (2.34)

which is symmetric if and only if =
sw” =T&,. (2.35) 13

This, in fact, implies that Er =Er + 2TEw =s — 2T&» =0, that is E(T, J) =E(J) does not depend [=
explicitly on T and we can identify E = E in (2.28). [2

(vi) Heat flux 3
Recall that, in the SHTC theory [8,9,16], the heat flux is introduced as : 3
q' := &&w, =TEw,, (2.36) cal
hence, if condition (2.35) holds, the thermal stress (2.34) can be equivalently rewritten as
JM Ej, =—(sésulu? + wh Sy, + grub + ug), (2.37)

which is manifestly symmetric. Hence, the total energy-momentum for a relativistic heat-
conducting fluid (anisotropic shear stress is omitted) reads

—T/ =(s& — €)uPup + (—pS — s& + E)h", — sw" up — We Ew, — Guy — U qu, (2.38)

so that we have
T= Euruy + ph, + Wpeo, +O Up + udu, (2.39)

with p := p&, + sé — & being the pressure. Here, the last two terms are conventional [3,58], while
the term w, &», is due to the non-equilibrium nature of the theory.
