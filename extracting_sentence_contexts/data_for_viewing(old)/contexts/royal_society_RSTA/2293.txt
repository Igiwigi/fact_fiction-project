Appendix A. Discrete Fourier transform

Akin to [40], in case of bulk incidence (3.5), it can be easily shown that uf, given by (4.3), is analytic
inside the annulus A, := {z € C: Ry. < |z| < R_}, where Ry =e" *2,R_ = e208 (for0<y<N,in
fact, R. = e+*2). Based on the above discussion, the discrete Fourier transform uf of the sequence
{uxy}xez is well defined for all y € Z. Using the discrete Fourier transform (4.3), the general
solution of the scattered wave field according to the discrete Helmholtz equation, i.e. (4.2) with
ut replaced by u since ui automatically satisfies it, is given by the expression uf =cyAY + c2A7Y,
where cj, C2 are arbitrary analytic functions on A and the function 4 is defined in [40,48,49],
