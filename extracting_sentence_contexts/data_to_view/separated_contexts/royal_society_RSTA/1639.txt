It should be noted, that it is not advisable to make direct comparisons here between the R?
values between the 1000G and 1600G simulations, to determine which case is more accurately
reproduced by the inversion algorithm. The reason why this is not possible, is due to the fact
that the two have different numbers of frames and, therefore, a different total number of spectra
from which these parameters are obtained. Therefore, the 1600G R? value may be artificially
higher in comparison to the 1000 G value purely for the fact that there are less measurements and
potentially fewer outliers than the 1000G data. This would imply that the algorithm performs
better in returning the synthetic spectra for the 1600G simulations, but that is not necessarily

R=1 (3.1)


the case. A meaningful comparison cannot be made in this case.
