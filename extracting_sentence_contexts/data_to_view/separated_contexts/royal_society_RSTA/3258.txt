Shiwa [40] established a discussion about the correctness of the Goldenfeld et al. analysis [5,6]
applied to the PFC equation for obtaining the respective AEq. First, Shiwa has found a small
analytical mistake in the AGD analysis, which does not influence the final result for AEq [41]. Second, Shiwa stressed the fact that the ADG analysis fails in the description of mode coupling. Mote specifically, because the PFC equation describes conserved dynamics, the amplitude of slow
neutral modes at zero wavenumber should be coupled with the modes at the critical wavenumber
behind which a homogeneous state becomes unstable. This second issue of zeroth mode for
conserved dynamics has also been successfully resolved [42] in obtaining the AEq of the PFC
equation.
