The foot (f.) is long and thin and
possesses a byssus groove on the posterior surface (see text-fig. 7, b.). It has two retractor
muscles, an anterior (a.r.) and a posterior retractor (p.r.) which are attached to the shell
in the same relative positions as in Cuspidaria rostrata. The palps are broader and
larger than those of the Cuspidariide, a fact which has been noted by all observers, the
anterior pair (a.p.) being especially long and, unlike the anterior palps of the Cuspidariidee,
being free from the anterior adductor (see also text-fig. 7). The posterior pair (p.p.)
are united to one another in the middle line and do not extend back on either side of the
foot as in Cuspidaria. The degree to which the mouth (m.) is guarded and obscured by
the palps is seen best in text-fig. 7 which was drawn from life.
