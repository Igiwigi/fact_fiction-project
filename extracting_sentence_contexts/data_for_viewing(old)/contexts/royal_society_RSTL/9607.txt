these tissues. The proof of this consists in the fact that sometimes waves of stimu-
lation will continue to pass from one tissue area to another after the passage of
contractile waves between these two areas has been blocked by section ; or, reverting
to the terms employed in my previous paper, excitational continuity may in some
cages remain intact after contractional continuity has been destroyed. And forasmuch
as it is impossible to suppose that an invisible, or very feeble, wave of contraction can
force a passage where a visiþle, or very strong, wave of the same kind fails to do 50,
the following observations must be regarded as eliminating the possible source of error

with which I am now dealing ; they establish the fact that whether or not wholly
invisible waves of contraction occur in Aurelia, waves of stimulation undoubtedly
occur. For the sake of brevity I shall quote these observations from my notes
verbatim —

* An Aurelia of medium size. One half of the margin removed in the form of a
strip two inches broad, the remainder of the umbrella being left attached. After
some overlapping sections had completely and permanently destroyed contractional
continuity in the strip, excitational continuity clearly remained intact, as shown by
the occurrence of a decided tentacular wave at the opposite 8ide of the umbrella
whenever the free end of the strip was irritated. That contractional continuity had
in this case been effectively destroyed was proved by tetanising the free end of the
strip four hours after the section with strong faradaic enrrents, and also with Spirit.
