ScHNEIDER (1902, p. 403) confirms ApArHy’s description of the contents of the
giant fibre. He finds.a bundle of very fine fibrille, with one or more somewhat
thicker ones, in the giant fibres of Hisenia (Lumbricus) rosea and states that from
this bundle fibrils pass out, by way of the branches of the giant fibres or directly
through the myelin sheath, into the neuropile.

Ramon y Casat (1904) briefly describes the appearance of the three giant tubes
of Lumbricus, as seen in preparations made by his new method, but he was unable to
ascertain their place of origin. A single neurofibril* runs, in a spiral course, in each
tube ; the central tube, although the largest, contains the most delicate fibril. He is
unable to confirm ApATHy’s statement that there are several fibrillee in each tube,
some coarse and others fine. He states that the fibrille in the giant tubes are much
thinner than those of the majority of the commissural and motor axones, a fact
which probably explains why those who have investigated these tubes by means of
the methods of Goner and Exruice have doubted their nervous nature.

Krawany’s recent researches (1905) on the nervous system of the earthworm do
not add much to our knowledge of the giant fibres. He states that in many places
a fibril is very clearly differentiated from the more feebly stained envelope, that
anastomoses between the giant fibres occur in each ganglion, and that branches are
given off. His fig. 6 (Taf. 3) shows a single moderately thick fibril in the giant fibre.
No reference is made, either by Scunerper, CAJAL, or Krawany, to the cells from
which the giant fibres arise.
