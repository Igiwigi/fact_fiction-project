Suppose now our condenser be submitted

to a periodically varying electromotive force, that

The effect of residual charge is to add to the capacity K the term ( cos pars (w) da,
“0

whilst the term sin pt| sin pow dw will have the effect of conductivity as regards
0

the phases of the currents into the flask. Thus the nature of the effect will depend
upon the form of the function y(w). An idea may be obtained by assuming a form,

for ys (w), say p(w): = =, where m is a proper fraction, This is a fair approximation
to.the truth, Then

[_ cos por (w) do =T (1 — m) cos (1 — m) 2/2/p'-™,
0

[_sin pos (w) dw = T (1 — m) sin (1 — m) 2/2/p'™.
0 ‘

If m is near to unity, capacity is almost entirely affected; otherwise the effect is
divided between the two, and dissipation of energy will occur, It is interesting to
consider what sort of conductivity a good insulator such as light flint glass, according
to this view of capacity, residual charge, and conduction, would have at ordinary
temperatures if we could measure its conductivity after very short times of electrifica-
tion; if, in fact, we could extend the practice used for telegraph cables and specify
that the test of insulation should be made after the one hundred millionth of a second
instead of after one minute, as is usual for cables. The capacity of light flint
measured with alternating currents with a frequency of two millions a second is
practically the same as when measured in the ordinary way; that is, its capacity will
be 67. Its index of refraction is 1°57 or p? = 2°46, or, say, 2°5.
