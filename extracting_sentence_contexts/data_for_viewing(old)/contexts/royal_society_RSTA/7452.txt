As was first intuitively suggested by Bernard (19414), the necessary condition for the
generation of microseisms on the present hypothesis is the interference of groups of waves of
the same wave-length travelling in opposite directions. Although not much is at present known
about the generation of waves by surface winds, observation certainly suggests that a wind
blowing steadily in one direction will in the course of time generate waves or swell travelling
mainly in that direction, or in a direction not differing by more than 45° from it. We must
therefore either look for cases in which two wind systems are in some way opposed, or else
assume the possible reflexion of wave energy from a steep coast.

Bernard suggested that favourable conditions for wave interference would be found at the
centre of a cyclonic depression, where waves originating on all sides of the depression might
be received. It is known that in a circular depression the winds, though mainly along the
isobars, have also a component inwards towards the centre, and in fact observation of sea
conditions in the ‘eye’ of a cyclone tend to confirm this expectation. It is well known that in
such regions relatively low wind velocities may be combined with high and chaotic seas such
as would be characteristic of wave interference.

Suppose then that in the centre of a circular depression in the Atlantic wave energy is
being received equally from all directions with a range of periods between 10 and 16sec.
The wave-length 4 in deep water being given approximately by A = gT?/2z, where T is the
period, we have A, <A <A,, where

A, = 1:54 10¢cm., A, = 4:00 x 104cm.
