S
& General Effects of Manures on Vegetation.—TIn the experiments under consideration,
She effects of the yarious manures on the vegetation were ascertained by observation of
Ahe plants during growth, noting the characteristic tendencies of development, by the
tanical separation or analysis of the mixed herbage, and by the weight and chemical
-Zompoxition of the produce. The various results have been or will be brought out in
Fetail elsewhere. But it should be called to mind here that a general tendency of
Witrogenous manures is to favour luxuriant and continuous growth as distinguished
Srom arrest and consolidation of that already formed ; whilst that of mineral manures
Ss to favour consolidation rather than luxuriance. Or, to put it in another way, a
Sharacteristic effect of nitrogenous manures is to favour the extension of foliage and
ESive it depth of colour, whereas that of the mineral manures is to tend to stem-
ormation and production of seed. Tn fact, a relative excess of nitrogenous supply
Savyours the extended growth of the organs of vegetation, prolonging their development,
At may be until the resonrces of the plant are exhausted or the season is past. On
Sthe other hand, a relative excess of mineral manures may bring on premature ripening.
Alt is the proper adaptation of the two descriptions of snpply to the current require-
ments of the plant and of the season that gives both full, properly proportioned, and
well-matured growth. It is obvious, therefore, that when a number of plants of
different habits, and different, periods of flowering and seeding are growing in association
as in the mixed herbage of grass land, the character of the manure must exert a very
potent influence on the struggle.*
It may be stated, however, that neither in the experiments ab Ruthamsted whether
on individual plants or on plants growing in association, nor in those made at Chiswick
