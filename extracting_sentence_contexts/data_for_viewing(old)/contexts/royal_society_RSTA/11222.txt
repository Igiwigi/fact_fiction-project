clear that the spring must satisfy some peculiar conditions. The thread must be
stretched by a constant, or nearly constant force, and the spring, while freely
allowing this to occur, must be incapable of moving so that the point of attachment
of the thread shall become displaced transversely. The spring must also be subject
to so much damping that it will not vibrate during transport, otherwise the rate of
subsidence of the thread may be affected and errors introduced. We have attempted
to meet these conditions in the following manner. The spring, as shown in the
drawings (Plate 13), consists of a pair of elliptical springs crossing each other at right
angles, the point of support for the thread being at the centre of the crossing. The
point to which the thread is attached is very light and might be lighter with advantage,
so as to increase the effect of the damping.

There are four bars of spring steel (watch main-spring, in fact), which are attached
to the plate carrying the coach springs so as to stand up perpendicular to the plate.
The free ends of these springs are attached by wire links to the thread support. The
object of this disposition is to damp down the free transverse vibrations of the
support. For a long time this formed the complete apparatus, which will be referred
to hereafter as the “rosette” spring.

In October, 1898, however, we had reason to believe that some small residual
irregularities were traceable to a transverse movement of the thread attachment.
We therefore put on three stays, made of very fine glass hairs, so as to hold the support
to the three girders of the main framework. The stays were cemented in position by
paraffin, and the wire linkages were also cemented at their points of contact by
means of paraffin. This has been completely successful, as the observations will show.
