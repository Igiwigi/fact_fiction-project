The personal element is also introduced to a less extent, since in this second
method the operations are much less exacting.

The disadvantage lies in the uncertainty of what is known as the ‘End
Correction” ; this renders the calculation of the theoretical resistance somewhat
difficult. From a reproduction standpoint, however, the uncertainty is of no

consequence,


96 MR. F. E. SMITH ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF

The essential difference between this and the first method lies in the fact that the
connecting tubes and standard are no longer in contact, but are separated by an
interval of 3 centims. The glass connecting vessels are the same as before, the
tubes passing through rubber bungs fitting tightly into the vessels. The action
of mereury on rubber has to be rendered negligible, and, should the erection be a
permanent one, contact with rubber is most inadvisable. Under such conditions the
ends of the tubes may be ground similar to glass stoppers, and vessels constructed
accordingly. Such permanent connections have been designed and will shortly be
employed. The rubber bungs used were first of all boiled in a weak solution
of caustic soda, and afterwards well sandpapered whilst wet. This operation
disposed of much of the free sulphur present. After several such boilings in soda
and in water, they were dried and immersed for some time in hot liquid paraffin wax.
A final washing followed, and the bungs were dried and ready for use. The thin °
