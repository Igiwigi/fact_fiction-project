thick (cf. fig. 19). calycinal section. Its interest is in the fact that, although its thickness is only
‘05 millim., the distance from one centre of calcification (c.c.) to the next is ‘08 millim.,
exactly the same as we have already observed in the thickest septa. We may
deduce, therefore, that in Mussa there is a minimum distance of ‘08 millim. between
one trabecular axis and the next, irrespective of the particular “order” to which a
septum belongs.
