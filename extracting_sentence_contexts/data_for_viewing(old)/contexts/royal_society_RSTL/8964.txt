than those of the parent stem. Tt is not impossible that as the branch develops, both
the contiguous primary wedges may contribute some vascular elements towards its for-
mation, as appears to be indicated by fig. 33.

In fig. 33 the peculiar cellular tissue which I have termed pseudo-cambial forms an
almost continuous semicircular belt around that peripheral upper portion of the branch
in which the yascular laminz have assumed their normal radiating order. But in fig. 34,
on the other hand, it has begun to concentrate itself into masses at the extremities of
the incipient primary vascular wedges, as in the matured stem. This is especially the
case at the four points 9, 9, 9, 9. It is obvious that these several points represent a cor-
responding number of incipient primary vascular wedges.

Having ascertained these facts, I turned with some interest to the well-known stems
of the Bignoniacer, to ee how far the orientation of their lateral branches corresponded
with what T have just described. In these plants there is a distinct medulla, and the
lateral twigs are given off in pairs. When this is about to take place, two of the four
woody wedges constituting the Maltese cross exhibited by a transyerse section of the
stem become much broader than the other two, and a prolongation of the pith passes
outwards through the centre of each of these enlarged wedges, and carries along with it
an investing cylinder chiefly composed of sclerenchyma. 'Thus each branch springs
from the centre of a woody wedge, and not from its sides, as in my fossil plant. It fol-
lows that in the Bignonic the areas occupied by the centripetal prolongations of the
cortex separating the four arms of the cross take no'part in the formation of the branch ;
whereas we have seen that in my fossil this area is largely concerned in its formation.
In one point, however, there is a resemblance between the two cases. In the very
