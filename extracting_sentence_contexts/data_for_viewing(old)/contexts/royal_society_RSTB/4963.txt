X-Ray Measurements.—Chest.

Measurements were made from X-ray films used for examining the heart size of the
chests of five members of the Expedition, both at sea-level and at Oroya or Cerro de
Pasco, with the object of determining: (1) whether there was any observable
difference in the dimensions of the chest as the result of temporary residence at a high
altitude; and (2) whether any difference existed between the proportions of the
chests of ourselves and members of the native population. For the latter comparison
X-ray pictures were made of the chests of seven Peruvians who had resided for many
years at a high altitude.

Measurement.—The selection of indices for measurement was guided largely by
practical considerations, resulting from the fact that the Expedition was equipped
with X-ray films for use in studying heart size, which were smaller (11 x 14 in.) than
is desirable for chest measurement. The points to be measured consequently had to
be chosen so that they could be found on the pictures made with these smaller films.
They are indicated in fig. 17.

clavicle with the first rib, A line is drawn through the mid-line of the vertebral
column. ‘Transecting it at A is drawn a line, aa, joining the points of intersection of
the diaphragm and the right and left margins of the heart. Transecting it at B is
