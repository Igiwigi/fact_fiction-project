that there is a set conjugate to P, Q, R, ....]

(VIL) For any particular set of auxiliaries there is one and only one improved
value of A. [This follows from the fact that the equations in (VI.), on the
assumption there stated, have one and only one solution.] Hence we get the
converse of (IIT.) :â€”

(VIIL) Jf x is the sum of w and a Le. of P, Q, R,..., and if the m.p.e. of x and
each of P, Q, R, ... is zero, then x is the improved value of w, using P, Q, BR, ... as
auxiliaries.
