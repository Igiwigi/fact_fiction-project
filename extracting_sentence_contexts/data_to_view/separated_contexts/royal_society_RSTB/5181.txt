BURNE ON “FINE” VESSELS ASSOCIATED WITH

vessel and the transverse elastic ligament that unites the articular bases of the
filamentary rays. In the Cod, an injection of the jugular and inferior jugular veins fills a system of
venous factors within the gill arches and filaments. MU.uer and others have already
observed this fact correctly, but are, I venture to think, in error, in regarding the
supra-ligamentous vessels (Plate 84, fig. 4, s.l.v.) as the path by which the blood is
conveyed to the jugular veins from the gills. As I hope to show below the supra-
ligamentous vessels are the chief lymph channels of the gills, as Foumann thought,
and have nothing to do directly with the venous circulation. From injections made into both the jugular and inferior jugular veins it is clear that
trunks in connection, with these veins emerge from both the ventral and dorsal extremities
of the gills.
