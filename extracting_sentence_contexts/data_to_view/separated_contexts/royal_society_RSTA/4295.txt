Of course, we can design molecules as
information carriers, transmitters and processors, but the very mention of design emphasizes
how such things are put in by hand. That idea is linguistically implicit in Barbieri’s assertion in
this theme issue that living matter is distinct from non-living by virtue of being ‘manufactured’
matter [19]. This point of view—specifically, the fact that living systems make observable things
with distinct structures and functions, and do so via a system of coding—leads Barbieri to propose
that it is not enough to propose that life is ‘chemistry plus information’—we must include ‘plus
codes’ too. Wills, meanwhile, argues that spontaneous symmetry-breaking transitions are the missing
ingredient that allowed a prebiotic system of information coding to emerge [20]. Regardless of
whether this can be securely demonstrated (like all origin-of-life ideas, it remains frustratingly : =
hard to test), it has the distinct virtue of encouraging us to cease imagining (if we ever did) 3
that life consists of islands of order surrounded by chaos.
