* H. Munk (‘Ueber die Functionen der Grosshirnrinde, 4te Mittheilung,’ fig. 4, p. 63) has
mapped out the external surface of the Monkey’s brain in a manner which, in certain particulars,
corresponds with the plan we have here given (in Diagram I[.). Although he regards the areas in
question as sensory rather than motor, the difference is merely one of terms, for the facts upon which he
rests this opinion are nearly the same as those which have guided us in arriving at our results. For the
author (p. 66) admits that he has found it difficult to prove that after extirpation of his so-called
“sensory areas” in Monkeys there is any loss of sensibility, at least to pressure, and it seems to be a
mere assumption that other forms of sensation, such as tactile sensibility and the muscular sense, are
abolished. Dismissing, then, the question of nomenclature, the two plans, so far as they deal with the
same regions, are strictly comparable.
