A complete molecule can be duplicated in three ways. If it is solid and three dimensional
only a supernatural agency, a divine copyist, can, entering its inner complexity, reproduce
it in detail. If we prefer a natural solution, we must imagine the molecule stretched out
either in a plane or along a line. In either case the simpler constituent molecules have only
to arrange themselves one by one on their identical partners in the original molecule, and
then become linked to each other by the absorption of suitable quanta from radiation or
from second order collisions. That such autocatalysis is possible is indicated by recent work
in Russia and America, where the regular atomic arrays of metallic catalysts are shown to
operate like laceworkers frames on which simple organic molecules settle to be joined into
larger aggregates. A two-dimensional reproduction of this kind is impossible, owing to the
fact that the constituent amino acids in nature are not symmetrical, but exist in right or left
hand forms. Two-dimensional reproduction would lead to mirror image molecules, which are
not found in nature. There remains then only one dimensional reproduction. At the moment
of reproduction, but not necessarily at any other time, the molecule of the protein must be
imagined as a pseudo-linear, associating itself, element by clement, with identical groups,
related by an axis instead of a plane of symmetry, and thus preserving only right or only left
handed symmetry.

DNA represents the ultimate information and structure: information is encoded
in the DNA molecule through the genetic code. Contributions to this Theme
Issue address different aspects of DNA structure and information, from the
mechanics of DNA [57] to surprising mathematical symmetry features found in
he genetic code [58]. We now know that the ribosome is the molecular machine
