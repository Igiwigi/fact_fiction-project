An examination of the table in § 2 shows that these predictions are largely confirmed
by the experimental values. ‘Two notable exceptions occur, however: these are
(1) while the values of yy are, as we expected, rather large (in one case 0-836), the
values of oyy are considerably smaller ; (2) the values of o;», which according to our
model should be nearly equal to o for an isotropic substance, are generally somewhat
larger. Another fact which the model does not explain is that Ey, is always greater than Ey,
We shallnow attempt to show that a reason for these facts is to be found in the existence
of the medullary rays. §5. The Medullary Rays.—We have already remarked that those wood-cells which
are not arranged longitudinally are grouped into bundles extending radially, called the
medullary rays.
