A similar structure is exhibited by the male tubes (B 4). The author thinks it probable that if the roots or attached ends (a, . fig. 28) of these
organs could only be followed through the integuments to their extreme outlets, they
would be found to divide into two limbs, an ingoing and an outgoing ; a fact which
would account for the clearly divided ciliary currents, as they are seen in the dilated
portions (A, B) of the organs (se arrows). Tf this fact of the bifurcation of the tube
were clearly determined, there would be no difficulty whatever in connecting the seg-
mental organs of Aphrodita with their homologues in the typical Annelids. In the

x absence of proof upon this point, however, they must be described as commencing in a
S aingle tube, the internal extremity of which divides into a numerous system of branches.
