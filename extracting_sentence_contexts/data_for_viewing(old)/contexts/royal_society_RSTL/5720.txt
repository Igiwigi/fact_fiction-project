and we thence obtain

VU+UVnO)-YVE@O<U VD)=—4a(o—)(Þ—y)(x—a%y),
which agrees with a former result.

125. The preceding formulze show without difficulty, that each factor of the cubi-
covariant is the harmonic of a factor of the cubic with respect to the other two factors
of the cubic; and moreover, that the factors of the cubic and the cubicovariant form
together an involution having for sibiconjugates the factors of the Hessian. In fact, the
harmonic of z—#y with respect, to (zx—Py)(x—y7y) is (22—S—1)z+(287 —18—40)h
which is a factor of the cubicoyariant ; the product of the pair of harmonic factors 15

and multiplying this by 8—y, and taking the swm of the analogous expressions. this
Sum vanishes, or the three pairs form an involution. 'That the Hessian gives the sibi-

- conjugates of the involution is most readily shown as follows :—the last-mentioned
