The hypothesis that the two forms of the Foraminifera represent the two se
appears to be disproved by the fact that in Orbitolites complanata, Lamx., hot
megalospheric and microspheric forms are found with the young of the megalospheri
form (primitive discs) in their brood chambers. Other genera furnish analogou
though less complete evidence. Hence it is impossible to regard either form as mal

We turn then to the other hypothesis, namely, that the two forms are members of
a recurring cycle of generations.

[This view receives further support from the facts that in the reproduction of the
microspheric form (Postscript 2) the whole of the protoplasm of the parent is divide
into the young, and that these all belong to one form, the megalospheric. On th
hypothesis that the two forms represent different sexes, we should expect to find
both megalospheric and microspheric young produced by the microspheric parent. Adopting this view, the individuals of the microspheric generation of Polystomella
give rise asexually, by a process of multiple fission, to young megalospheric forms,
and these in their turn produce, also by that multiple fission, the flagellate zoospores,

In Orlitolites the microspheric form gives rise to megalospheric young, but in this
genus, as in Peneroplis and Rotalia, the megalospherie form may repeat itself for one
or more generations, though ultimately it may be assumed by analogy with Poly-
stomella, that a megalospheric form is produced which gives rise to zoospores.
