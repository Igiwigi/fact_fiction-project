These results distinctly prove that, although there is not much evidence of true
“liquation”—that is, rejection of a constituent of an alloy—the palladium does
become concentrated by gravity towards the bottom of the “ freezing” mass. It is
noteworthy that this alloy, when heated to bright redness in vacuo by means of a
Sprengel pump, did not yield hydrogen. It was, in fact, singularly free from occluded
gas.
Following the matter up, the proportions of the same metals were reversed, and an
alloy of—

was then operated on.

The constituent metals for this alloy were, as in the case of the former one, twice
melted in a lime furnace by means of the oxyhydrogen flame, and cast to ensure
perfect homogeneity, then re-melted, and cast into a lime sphere of 3 inches diameter.
