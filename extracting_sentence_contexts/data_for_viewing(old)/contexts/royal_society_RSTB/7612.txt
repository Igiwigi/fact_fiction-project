“Tobacco was known in New Guinea at least in the beginning of the seventeenth
century, for it is mentioned by Jacob Le Maire, who sailed along the coasts of the
island in the year 1616....Dr Merrill’s supposition that tobacco was introduced into
New Guinea from Amboina is purely subjective and does not constitute historical
evidence.’ Laufer refers to his own efforts to do away with ‘all wild guesswork and
speculation. ..and replacing it with facts based upon documentary evidence’, but he
admits the possibility of a native species of tobacco in New Guinea, for which there has
never been any documentary evidence. Had he been alive he might have modified
his views in accordance with later information.

In a letter to me (1928) Van Nouhuys writes that, when he was with the Lorentz
expeditions of 1907 and 1909-10, he was struck by the fact that the natives of the
Lorentz river and its tributaries were absolutely ignorant of the use of tobacco and
betel, which was in strong contrast to the Péségém, on the southern slopes of the
Central Range, who smoke their home-grown tobacco, mbali, though they do not chew
betel nut, which, however, is done by the Timorini and Baliem on the opposite
northern slopes, where locally grown tobacco is called tavo. He considers the word
mbali as belonging to the purer Papuan language, whereas the northern tribes accepted
the term favo; which is nearer to the name of the imported tobacco; for tobacco has
always been in strong demand along the northern coast of New Guinea. He is con-
vinced that at the time of the early voyagers, tobacco came from the interior of New
Guinea to the north coast. He considers it impossible if tobacco came to New Guinea
in recent times as an article of barter that it could be growing now in that remote part
where the Péségém live. Van Nouhuys (1931, p. 77) says, the manifold and great
