In the year 1860 the Ritter von HaipixGer *® first gave an account of the very remark-
able meteorite that fell at Shalka, in Bancoorah, Bengal, on the 30th of November, 1850.
The ash-like dark grey substance which forms the mass of this meteorite was described
by the illustrious Viennese authority as a new silicate, to which he gave the name of Pid-
dingtonite. He was, in fact, led to do this in consequence of an analysis of the mineral
by K. vox HAvER, which yielded oxygen ratios corresponding to © a compound of bisi-
licate and trisilicate of iron and magnesium.”

This assumed sesquisilicate, however, which has haunted the mineralogy of meteorites
under the names of Chladnite, Shepardite, and, subsequently, of Piddingtonite, was sur-
mised by GusTay RosEf to be in this case a mixture of more than one silicate, while in
the similar instance of the Bishopsville meteorite Dr. Lawrexce Smrrn} had already
proved the supposed Chladnite to have been no other than an augitic mineral, in fact |
one with the composition and characters of enstatite. The mineral, however, which |
forms the mass of Shalka does not seem to be 80 easily disposed of; for Professor Raw- ©
MELSBERG has recently published an analysis of the mineral or minerals under discussion,
and asserts the Shalka meteorite to contain svmething like 12 per cent. of olivine of the
composition 2Fe, Si O, + 3Mg, Si O, ||, the remainder being bronzite.

This meteorite had been examined some time back in the British Museum Laboratory
with a very different result, and the discrepancies between this result and those as well
of RAMMELSBERG as of Vox HAUER induced me to have the analysis confirmed by further
investigation. The conclusion, however, to which these experiments have led till leave
the discrepancy where it was. In fact the selection out of the debris of the meteorite
of the different ingredient minerals, or what seemed to be such, had at first led to the
