The calibration
correction at 50°C. was therefore reduced by 0-009° C. and the corrections between
0 and 50° C. were changed proportionately.* The broken thread observations, which
were taken on the travelling microscope of the Metrology Department, are shown
in detail in Table IX. An estimate was made as to the magnitude of the error introduced by the fact that
on the average about 0-7°C. of the mercury column was emergent during all the
observations. In the hypsometer one of the Tonnelot thermometers was replaced by
a small maximum thermometer, which was supported in an inverted position with just
the bulb (about 1 cm. long) exposed.
