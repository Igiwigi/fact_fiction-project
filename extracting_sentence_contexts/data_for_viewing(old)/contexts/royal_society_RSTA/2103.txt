(t). In the timespan At between collisions the piston gets accelerated by an external force F,(t) =
Ma(t), where M is the piston mass and a(t) is the acceleration of the piston in the microscopic time
interval [t,t + At], ie.

T(t + At) =u(t) + a(t)At. (2.1)

We assume that a(f) is approximately constant between two successive collisions and for
simplicityâ€™s sake we also assume that At is so short that only single-particle collisions take place
within this time window. We also define the macro-variable L as

Lij= lu) +u(t+ At). (2.2)

In fact, the piston is a thermodynamic system of its own, but for our purposes we will consider
it to be one rigid block with constant internal energy playing no role in any of our following
considerations, thereby reducing it to one degree of freedom (according to our convention in the
z-direction) that can be controlled externally. The latter further implies that the x and y particle
velocity components do not explicitly play any role as the piston can recoil in collision events only
in the z-direction. The inherent jitter of the piston position and its velocity around their respective
macroscopic values, reflecting the piston temperature will be neglected in the following. This
simplification will allow us to demonstrate the mathematical reasons of mechanical irreversibility
without considering details that would unnecessarily complicate our discussion. For the same
reason, we assume that the piston glides without friction within the cylinder and that heat transfer
between possible heat-baths and the working medium (ideal gas) in the piston happens quasi-
instantaneously, i.e. the gas temperature can still be set to the heat bath temperature. This would
not be true if finite heat transfer coefficients would cause a lag between the working medium and
