7-18). In
very young tubercles the cells contain only these hyphz ; subsequently, when the
tubercle reaches the dimensions of a mustard-seed, the tiny bacterium-like bodies begin
to accumulate. In sections through very young tubercles, made transversely to the long axâ€™s of the
root, and passing axially through the tubercle, I have observed the following facts. A fairly strong hypha, several times thicker than the cell-walls in many cases, can be
traced through from the epiderinis to the origin of the young tubercle (figs. 7, 8, 9) ;
the tip of the tubercle is always directed so as to meet this hypha.
