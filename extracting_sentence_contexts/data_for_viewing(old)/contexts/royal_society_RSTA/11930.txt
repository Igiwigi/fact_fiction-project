into which it gradually merges, until at 100 atmospheres the intensity curve is like
that of the copper lines. The sharp appearance of the line is thus gradually lost and
the result is a broad, diffuse and soft line.

Examples of these lines are :—

(a) Symmetrical.
U1, 4065°22 (Plate 3). This is the only very strong line that is symmetrically
broadened. It preserves its character from 1 to 200 atmospheres.

(b) Unsymmetrical—unilateral.

(c) Unsymmetrical—bilateral.

In this class the broadening is unequal on the two sides, and it is obviously
intermediate between (a) and (b). Line r2 is very broad, and extends over 90 A.U.
