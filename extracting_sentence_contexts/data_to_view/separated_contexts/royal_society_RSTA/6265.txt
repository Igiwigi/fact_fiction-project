At this point, the vertical link
associated with the node at 1 = 23 fails. Thus, for the case shown in figure 1b, there are two sites
within the structure that can fail, and this violates the conditions under which the bridge crack
can propagate steadily. In fact, as we show below, if one also considers the elongation of the
horizontal links in this isotropic medium, depending on their strength, one can show that none of
these regimes is physically acceptable. The structure of the article is as follows. In ยง2, we introduce the problem and the governing
equations of a discrete elastic chain separating as a result of the propagation of a bridge crack.
