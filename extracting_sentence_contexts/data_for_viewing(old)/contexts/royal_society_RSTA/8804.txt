tan 6 = sin $a cot x/sin $8, cos y = cn u.

Formula (17) remains a valid approximation for 6? provided L* is defined by (30).

ยง 6. A Discussion of the Probable Effects of Damping, and Other Factors Omitted in the
Foregoing Solution.

Up to this point we have assumed that the motion in yaw is exactly periodic with
half-period QT. This would be exactly true if the couple M were a function of 4 only,
OP a fixed straight line, and no other couples existed. In actual fact, M is a function
of the forward velocity and therefore of the time; OP changes direction under the
influence of gravity and the cross-wind force, and other couples besides M act on the
shell, depending on the angular velocity of the shell. All these factors cause progressive
changes in the curve of yaw from period to period ; for the case of the stable rounds
they have been discussed at length in (A), where it is shown that they do not appreciably
affect the determination of M at any velocity for small values of 4. In particular,
the effect of gravity is almost entirely allowed for by using (as we do) the true yaw
and not the angle between the axis of the shell and some fized straight line. As explained
in (A)* the shape of the hole in the cards determines the true yaw and not the angle
between the axis of the shell and the normal to the card.

There is no reason to expect that any of these damping effects will be relatively
