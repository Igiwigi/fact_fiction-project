In the same year Fiorran (1928, 6) figured a prochordal plate in an embryo with four
paired somites (embryo Bi III), but without recognising it as such. Porrrzer (1930),
in describing the prochordal plate in his embryo Ct with seven paired somites, has
identified the structure in question in the figures of the embryo Bill as a prochordal
(completion) plate, and this identification we accept. As a matter of fact, Frortan had
recognised it as such before Porrrzerâ€™s paper was published. Potrrzer also recognised
the existence of a prochordal plate in the embryo H 197, BarretMez-Evans (1926). The observations of the authors mentioned above indicate that the production of
mesenchyme by the prochordal plate in the human embryo does not reach its
maximum prior to the differentiation of the somites.
