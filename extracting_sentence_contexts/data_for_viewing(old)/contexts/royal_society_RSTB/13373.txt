sperm capacitation and the acrosome reaction, which are
necessary precursors to fertilization [34,35].

FRF-mediated sperm chemotaxis describes the capacity of
sperm to respond to chemical attractants in order to locate
and swim towards the egg. Much of the evidence for
FRF-mediated sperm chemoattraction comes from marine
invertebrates [36], but sperm chemoattraction mediated by
the FRF has also been demonstrated in a range of internally
and externally fertilizing taxa, including fishes [24,37],
mammals [38-40] and indeed humans [41,42], among many
other metazoans [43]. Interestingly, despite the fact that
sperm chemotaxis was one of the first components of the
FRF-ejaculate interaction to be documented, with research
on the topic dating back to the end of the nineteenth century
(see electronic supplementary material), it has rarely been
considered in the context of sperm competition until very

adverse environmental conditions into which they are
released, thereby prolonging egg viability [14]. Recent work
indicates that FRF is also involved in protecting eggs and
embryos from pathogens. For example, proteomic analyses
of FRF in species such as fishes, insects and humans confirmed
the presence of proteins related to the immune system and ser-
