At this point, recall remark :8
4.1. Note that the incident surface wave satisfies (4.8) with z= z;, so that according to (4.7), £ :3
has a zero at 2, and using |z;| < 1, £+(+z;) =0. In fact, £ (4.7) possesses a simple zero at all four Ss
points tz corresponding to the surface waves on crack faces. Thus, the term (z + zi) 1X(z) in the
expression of solution (4.13) contains both poles corresponding to the incident surface wave (|zj| <

1) and the two reflected surface waves (| + 2; yy > 1as zeros of £_(z)). With the details omitted (see
