Sen adopted on the former occasion ; alcohol and ether were again the principal means
ployed for conducting the analysis, chemical decompositions being thereby avoided
2nd the constituents of excrements consequently obtained under the form of Tnmediate
Erinciples. It will also be observed that in this case, for the purpose of extracting
Sccretine, the alcoholic solution of excrements was in many instances not mixed with
Milk of lime, which simplified materially the operations and increased the interest of the
Eneatigation.
f The results obtained are as follows :—
& 1. Margarate of lime, phosphate of lime, and margarate of magnesia were discoyered
Þ be three immediate principles of human evacuations.
S 2. I found a new and simple method for obtaining excretine, and its chemical for-
Sul has been established.
& 3. The fact that vegetable food increases the presence of margaric acid in excrements
has been confirmed.

4. The existence of a comparatively large quantity of cholesterine in the spleen, which
I had mentioned as probable, has been confirmed #.

When healthy human evacuations are exhausted with boiling alcohol an extract is
obtained, which, on cooling, leaves a deposit. This deposit was examined as follows :—
The dark alcoholic solution being decanted, the residue was thrown upon a filter and
washed thoroughly, first with cold and then with boiling alcohol. The boiling alcoholic
80lution, on cooling, yielded more or less of a peculiar substance, in the form of a light
granular precipitate, which has been alluded to in my previous communication. The
