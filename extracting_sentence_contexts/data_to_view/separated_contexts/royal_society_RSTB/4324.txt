The primitive elliptical cecium is retained as far as P. suffulta,
otherwise the characters run the same course as in the typical lineage, except that
P. simplex is catagenetic in its length as well as in the size of its aperture. In the lineage P. calceata (figs. 1, 49), P. crepidaria (fig. 47), P. dorbignyi
(fig. 48), the avicularia tend to take up a definite position proximal and lateral to
the aperture, as in the genus Ichnopora, which probably arose from this stock. In
fact, it is difficult to justify the retention of P. crepidaria and P. d’orbignyi in one
genus rather than the other; and, if it is decided that Jchnopora arose from
P. crepidaria, it would be a simpler course to include this species as well as
P. @orbignyi in Ichnopora. Again, if some species of Ichnopora arose from
P. calceata and others from P. d’orbignyi, it would be necessary to remove both
species to Jchnopora to prevent that genus being polyphyletic. Until, however, the
detailed origin of Ichnopora is clear, it is best to keep that genus for those species
which exhibit the generic tendencies in a marked degree.
