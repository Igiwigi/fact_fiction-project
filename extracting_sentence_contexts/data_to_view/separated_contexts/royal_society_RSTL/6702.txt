There are besides the hk lines joining each double point of the curve m with
each double point of the curve n. This gives in all [m]P[n]Þ+hk lines; or, writing
h=3[mP+M, k=3[nÞ+N, the number is

=ImP(nP+M.4n}+N.4[mP-+MN;
which is the value of G(n?, 1?) given by the investigation.
26. G(n?, n)—We have
Gm, un)=nG(1, n)=nS(nw),
and it is in fact the same question to find G(1, m?) and to find S(m?). I assume for the
present that the value is =3$[m]P+M(m—2); and we then have

G(m, n)=n(4[mP+M(m—2)). MDCCCLXIN, 3K
