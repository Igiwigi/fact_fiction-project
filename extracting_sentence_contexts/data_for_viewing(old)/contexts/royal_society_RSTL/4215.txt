Sin the currents, and could only be overcome, and then only in part, by slow and
Snamerous observations. These currents were often found to have prevalent sets, but
Sthese were, to a large extent, remedied by the observations in two positions, 7. e. at
Jibo upsetting points. For low temperatures a smaller trough was employed, well
Sclothed in flannel and filled with an excellent frigorific mixture.

3398. Bismuth crystal â€”The crystal before described (3373.) was placed on the
torsion balance; its upsetting angle was then ascertained to be 105*; and being
observed from time to time, it was found to remain the same both for low and high
temperatures. The torsion force was measured, first at common temperatures, then
as the temperature rose, and also as it fell ; it was observed to be greater at the same
upper temperature when rising than when falling ; an effect referred by particular
examination to the fact that the lower the temperature of the bismuth the greater
the torsion force; and that, as before said, as the bismuth gained its temperature
later than the oil and thermometer in the bath, s0 it was cooler in the first case than
in the second, for the same thermometer indication. As the cooling was purposely
rendered slow, that the temperature of the bismuth might be near to that indicated

by the thermometer and the currents in the fluid weaker, 80 the observations were
always considered best when made with a standing or a falling temperature.
