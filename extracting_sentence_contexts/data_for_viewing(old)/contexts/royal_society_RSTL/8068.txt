Hriamonrzz's theory is also applicable when there are more openings than one in the
side of the vessel.

In the present paper I have attempted to give the theory of vibrations of this sort
in a more general form. The extension to the case where the communication with
the external air is no longer by a mere hole in the side, but by a neck of greater or
less length, is important, not only because resonators with necks are frequently used in
practice, but also by reason of the fact that the theory itself is applicable within wider
limits. The mathematical reasoning is very different from that of Heiamnonr, at least
in form, and will I hope be found easier. In order to assist those who may wish only
for clear general ideas on the subject, T have broken up the investigation as much
as poxsible into distinct problems, the results of which may in many cases be taken for
granted without the rest becoming unintelligible. In Part T. my object has been to put
what may be called the dynamical part of the subject in a clear light, deferring as much
as possible special mathematical calculations. In the first place, I haye considered the
general theory of resonance for air-spaces confined nearly all round by rigid walls, and
communicating with the external air by any number of passages which may be of the
nature of necks or merely holes, under the limitation that both the length of the necks
and the dimensions of the vessel are yery small compared to the waye-length. To prevent
misapprehension, I ought to say that the theory applies only to the fundamental note of
