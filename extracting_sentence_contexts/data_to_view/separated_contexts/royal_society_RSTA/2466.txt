* Loc. cit. XXIV., p. 63, 1911. + Such considerations are accentuated by the fact that, although the solenoidal field remains constant,
the field within the specimen increases as its magnetisation falls. THE EUTECTOID TRANSITION POINT OF CARBON STEELS. 187

We may assume tentatively that the intercept PQ is a measure of the amount of
iron in the eutectoid and that, similarly, the intercept QM is a measure of the amount
of excess iron.
