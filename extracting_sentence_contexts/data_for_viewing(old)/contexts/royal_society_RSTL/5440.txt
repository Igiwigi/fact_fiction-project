and arranged in a square, I term such square the Bezoutic square. This square,
as shown in art. (7.), is symmetrical above one of its diagonals, and corresponds
therefore (as every symmetrical matrix must do) to a homogeneous quadratic function
of '(m) variables of which it expresses the determinant. This quadratic function,
which plays a great part in' the last section and in the theory of real roots, I term the
Bezontiant ; it may be regarded as'a species of generating function. Returning to
the Bezontic system, I prove that the Bezontian secondaries are identical in form
with the snccessive simplified residues. In art. (6.) I extend these results to the case
of f and @ being of different dimensions in x. In art. (7.) I give a mechanical rule
for the construction of the Bezoutic square. In art. (8.) I show how the theory of
f(x) and 6(z), where the latter is of an inferior degree to f, may be brought under
the operation of the rule applicable to two, functions; of the, same. degree. at the
expense of the, introduction, of a, known and very. simple factor, which in fact will-be
a constant, power of the leading coefficient in F(x). In art. (9.) I give another method
of obtaining directly the simplified residues in all cases. Tn art. (10.) I present the

process of successive division under its most general aspect. In arts. (11.) and (12.)

I demonstrate the identity of the algebraical sign of the Bezoutian secondaries with
