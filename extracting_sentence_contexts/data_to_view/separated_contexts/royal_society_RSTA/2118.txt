In this work, we
provide some cursory answers as these questions merit substantially deeper study in the own
right. Dealing with uncertainty: the implementation of de-noising will strongly depend on the form
of the uncertainty present in the system. We may define uncertainty as a probability distribution
that encodes how likely it is to obtain semantic object x’ when in fact, the ground truth is x. For
example, if the probability density only depends on the ‘circular distance’ (equation (3.3)) between
the x and x’ objects® we may use an adaptation of element-wise average for de-noising. The
average is computed as the mid-point along the geodesic.
