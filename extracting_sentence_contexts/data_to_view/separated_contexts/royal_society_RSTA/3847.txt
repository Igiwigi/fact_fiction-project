It certainly has a
very straight trend, and, looking at it on the map, one is at once struck with this
peculiarity. In this respect it differs entirely from the smaller subsidences at the
mouths of the streams at Larikai and Trois Loups. Another fact of great interest
is the rapidity with which the water deepens off the new shore. Mr. P. Fosrrr
Huaaers,t of Chateaubelair, found that at 50 feet from the beach the depth is
74 fathoms, at 100 feet 18 fathoms, a submarine slope of 45Â°. This is a gradient
much higher than is usual along this side of the island, and may be due to the
presence of a fracture, on the seaward side of which there has been depression.
