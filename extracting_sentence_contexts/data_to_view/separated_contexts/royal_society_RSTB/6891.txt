Figure 27 (and
figure 94, plate 12) at a lower level, show a strand of bud xylem lying alongside the xylem
of the conjoined meristeles, and in figure 28, still lower down, the bud stele is beginning
to fade out. Observations such as these, which have been repeated in many different buds,
confirm an earlier finding that where bud development is induced some distance away
from the shoot apex, the junction of bud stele and shoot stele tends to be incomplete or
may not be effected at all (Wardlaw 19434, 6). It is difficult to see how such facts can
be explained other than in terms of a basipetal initial differentiation of vascular tissue
in the sense defined by Wardlaw (1944). During the normal development, the bud stele may become conjoined not only with the
shoot stele but also with a strand of the leaf-trace. Buds of D. filix-mas, though axillary in
origin (Wardlaw 19434), are typically associated with the leaf-traces only.
