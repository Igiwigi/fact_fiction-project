D. Spinal Cord.

It will be scarcely realised, except by those who have made a special study of the
literature of the physiology of the spinal cord, how little has been done which would
enable us to carry out, strictly speaking, the differentiation of the subject, of conduc-
tion in that organ, by arranging the facts in the same way as we have just done for
the higher parts of the nervous system. So much so is this the case that we do not
intend to do more at this stage than indicate what we believe to be a fair estimate of
the experimental work already accomplished. In introducing our own work later on,
which directly bears on the points at issue, we shall draw attention to many of
the more salient details which require attentive discussion. We will, therefore
now content ourselves with furnishing a general review of the function of con-
duction in the cord. We may note in passing that almost all the literature is to be
found in the writings of von Brzotp, EckHARD, GRUNHAGEN, Scuirr, IMMANUEL
Monk, and others. We would, in the first place, urge, what we have reason to do
with greater weight later, that not one of the foregoing methods, 2.e., graphic degene-
ration, embryological, &c., is capable of answering the question of conduction or its
localisation in an absolute manner. The great difficulty in considering conduction by
