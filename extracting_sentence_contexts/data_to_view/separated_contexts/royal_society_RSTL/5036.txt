It seems readily possible that a magne-
crystal might exist, which, when in its stable position, should neither cause the con-
vergence nor divergence of the lines of force within it. It need only be neutral in
relation to space or any surrounding medium in that direction, and diamagnetic in
its relation in the transverse direction, and the conditions would be fulfilled. 3158, But though an ordinary magnetic needle* cannot show polarity in a field of
equal force, having no reference to it, and in fact ignoring such a condition of things,
a moving wire makes it manifest instantly, and also shows the full amount of mag-
netic power to which such polarity belongs; and this it does without disturbing the
distribution of the power, as far as we comprehend or understand distribution, when
thinking of magnetic needles. At least such at present appears to me to be the
case, from the consideration of the action of thin and thick wires (3141.) and wires
of different substances (3153.).
