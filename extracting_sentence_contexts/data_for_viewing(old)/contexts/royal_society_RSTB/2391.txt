extremity this was not the case, the margin of the sporophyll projecting far beyond
the base of the integument. We have also found that the micropylar opening
between the upper edges of the integument had the form of a long crevice, extending
practically the whole length of the seed, in the radial direction. The question
remains, whether the integument formed a mere trough, open at the ends, or was
closed at the proximal and distal extremities. As regards the distal end there is no
doubt that the integument abutted on, and was continuous with, the ascending
lamina of the sporophyll, which itself formed the wall of the “seed” at that
extremity. This is shown, for example, in the approximately radial section repre-
sented in fig. 14. The section is sufficiently radial to follow the narrow base (a) of
the sporangium through almost its whole length, and to show the vascular bundle for
some distance. That it is not, however, in a strictly vertical plane is proved by the
too small height of the “seed,” and by the fact that it is closed in above by the
integument ; a truly radial section would of course follow the micropylar opening in
this region. As a matter of fact, the narrow ridge of the “seed,” where the
micropyle is situated, is missed (as is almost always the case) by the plane of section.
The figure is, however, interesting, because it shows how, as the sporangium narrows
out towards the distal extremity, the integument, roofing it in above, approaches the
ascending lamina, and eventually meets and joins the latter. How far the union in
this part was a congenital one cannot be determined. The integument, no doubt,
grew out from the lower part of the ascending lamina, as well as from the horizontal
pedicel, but towards the top the junction between integument and lamina may have
been due to a subsequent adhesion.*

At the proximal end, on the other hand, it seems clear that the closure of the seed
