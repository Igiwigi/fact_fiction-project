The nuclei are then washed successively with 50%, 70% and absolute alcohol, the
washing with the latter solvent being repeated as many times as is necessary completely
to remove the yellow pigment which is usually, but not invariably, associated with fowl
erythrocyte nuclei. They are then suspended in ether and filtered at the pump. Micro-
scopic examination of nuclei prepared by this method reveals the fact that a proportion
of the nuclei, although free from haemoglobin, retain the stroma. Thus, in wet smears
of the undried preparations an outline (‘ghost’) of the whole cell, retaining its original
oval shape and containing a nucleus in the centre, can sometimes be seen, while in
preparations treated with alcohol or completely dried a fine jagged protruberance, evidently
consisting of part or all of the stroma, juts out from the surface of many, but not all,
nuclei. The proportion of nuclei retaining stroma can, we believe, be considerably
diminished by vigorously stirring a suspension of the nuclei from the final saline washing
in 4 % acetic acid, straining through muslin and repeating the treatment on the centri-
fuged material with 1 % acetic acid.
