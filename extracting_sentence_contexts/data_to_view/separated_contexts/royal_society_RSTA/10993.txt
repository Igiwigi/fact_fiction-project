It shows us what type of cross-section will give us four fail-
points not at the points of the contour closest to the centre; within what limits we
may expect to find this exception to the ordinary rule; and in what manner this case
passes into others. Again, with regard to the effect of keyways upon the torsional rigidity, the results
of the paper tell us that, without risk of sensible error, we may in practice, in order
to get the joint effect of two indefinitely thin keyways or slits, add the known effects
of each keyway, taken separately. Further, these results bring the theory of elasticity into better accordance with
observed facts, by showing that the effects of keyways of moderate depth are
comparatively much smaller than would have been expected from the results for the ~
circle.
