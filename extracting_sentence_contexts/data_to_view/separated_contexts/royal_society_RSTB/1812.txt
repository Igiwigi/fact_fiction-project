Each sorus is inserted above
a single nerve, and between the sori, plates of tissue arise from the surface of the leat’;
these plates, which have been described as indusia, are enlarged upwards so as
partially to cover the sori (compare ‘Genera Filicum,’ Tab. 7, figs. 2, 4, 6). With
insufficient data such as these before us, and without any facts of development, we
must begin the investigation of the sori of Danaea. The material used was of D. elliptica (SmirH), collected by Mr. Extiov, in St.
Vincent, and forwarded to me through Mr, Grorce Murray, and D, alata (Smrru),
sent to me by the late Dr. Trimen. ‘The characters of these species are well known ;
the sori were found to be essentially similar in the two species, except that the
number of loculi in D. alata is much smaller than in D, elliptica.
