Tt bears a strong resemblance to Coniothecium Amentacearum, and
Thavye some grounds for supposing that, like that species, it is a conidioid form of fruit
of a Sphezeria (Spharia lanciformis) which is not uncommon in this country upon Birch. T have not yet been able to prove satisfactorily the connexion between the two, but
further observation may poxsibly establish it. In the plants above described, the two forms of fruit, assuming them to arise from
the same mycelium, must be consider2d as essentially distinct, that is, the secondary
form has no further connexion with the normal fructification, than the fact of being

produced upon the same mycelium ; but other cases occur in which the normal form of
fruit is 80 far modified and altered by external circumstances, as to appear at first 8ght
as if belonging to a different species or even genus. It is an opinion rapidly gaining ground, that by far the greater number of the plants
composing the genera Diplodia, Sporocadus, Spharopsis, Hendersonia, Phoma and others,
are only imperfect forms of different species of Spheria, and a wide field of observa-
tion is thus opened in order to allot to each individual member of these pseudo-genera
its proper place in the mycological system.
