I frequently obtained no precipitate with ammonia, and then the oxalate gave the
band brilliantly ; and occasionally the ammonia precipitate when formed gave little or
no citron band. IT was, however, generally sure to find it in the insoluble oxalate,
and sometimes it was very brilliant, being accompanied by two bright green bands
and a fainter red band.

6. At this time one of the minerals which showed the citron band most strongly
was a phosphorescent apatite from Ireland ; and knowing the difficalties of separating
the-last traces of phosphoric acid from the earths, I explained the foregoing facts by
the presence of 8mall quantities of phosphoric acid, which gave rise to the ammonia
precipitate ; the bulk of the citron body not being precipitated by ammonia, but
coming down as oxalate ; whilst a little of this oxalate would remain dissolved in
the ammoniacal salts present, and 80 appear with the alkalies,

I tested this hypothesis in every imaginable way, by mixing small quantities of
phosphorie acid with salts of lime and other earths, in the endeayour to imitate the
conditions occurring in the native minerals, and 80 educe the citron band ; but I was
unable to get any precipitate giving the citron band when I started with materials
which did not originally give it.

7. A sufficient quantity of precipitated oxalate (5) having in course of time been
accumulated, T attempted its purification. It was ignited, dissolved in dilute hydro-
chloric acid, and rendered slightly alkaline with ammonia and ammonic sulphide.
