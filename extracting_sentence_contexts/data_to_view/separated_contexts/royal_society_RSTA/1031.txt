This relaxing map corresponds to a controllable deformation for isotropic materials, meaning iB
that it can be supported by surface tractions alone at equilibrium. It describes the opening of s
the initial disc into a circular sector, corresponding to non-homogeneous displacements and :
homogeneous strains [62,63]. In fact, we remark that (7.9) does not globally map a physically
compatible configuration even if the Riemann curvature of the underlying metric tensor is zero. This can be easily checked since the curl operator of the deformation tensor corresponding to
(7.9) is not zero if Ag 41. From (7.7), this condition implies Urr 4 Yoo, or equivalently y 40.
