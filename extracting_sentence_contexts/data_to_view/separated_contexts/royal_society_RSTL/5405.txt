The curye in question is of
he form APU+BQU=0. We have, in fact, identically,

[- 3T.PU—48.QU=(1+8PY {(P+#*+8)—3trt}. It is clear that the curve in question must have the curve PU=0 for its Hessian ; and
in fact, in the formula of my Third Memoir,

H(64PU+BQU)=(—2T, 488?, 18 TS, T?+16 Se, 8)* PU
+( 88 ” T , —8Y, —TS Xs, BY QU.
(882+TB)(a*—88?);
and therefore, putting «=4T, Þ=—4S, we find

H(3T.PU—4S.QU)=—4(T*—648'YPU.

The coefficient of QU is

20. The consideration of the curve 3T.PU—48.QU=0, gives risze to another
geometrical theorem. Suppose that the line (E, n, Z), that is, the line whose equation is
Ez+79+02=0, is with respect to this curve of the third class one of the four polars of a
point (X, Y, Z) of the Hessian, and that it is required to find the envelope of the line
