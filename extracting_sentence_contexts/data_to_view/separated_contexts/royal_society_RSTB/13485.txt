Figure 4. Comparison between setups with different transfer and mutation settings. Transfer accounts for the proportion of control parameter values that are exchanged
between robots. tsf = 0.8 and tsf = 1.0 respectively signify that 80% and 100% of the parameter values are sent during an encounter between robots.
