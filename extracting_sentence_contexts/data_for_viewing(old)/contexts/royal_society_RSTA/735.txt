models; also in actuator line models overpredictions in turbine power are observed, for which a as)

heuristic blade tip correction is often applied [10,11]. :s
Figure 14 illustrates Cp as a function of Ch, obtained from a steady-state actuator disc aS

under uniform inflow. The circle markers indicate simulation results with Cp = Ch for the same : a

resolution employed for the cases in ยง3, and illustrate an overpredicted Cp. Consistent with the [8g

fact that the overprediction in power is caused by an overestimation in disc velocity due to the :8

diffuse rotor representation, the error increases for increasing Ch, since velocity gradients are :s

higher for larger thrust forces. Although it is shown that this overprediction is diminished for

higher grid resolutions (triangles), this is not a practical solution since present-day computational

constraints do not allow optimal control simulations on finer grids. Therefore, a solution to this

problem is to calibrate Cp based on a least-squares fit to results obtained from 1D momentum

theory, yielding Cp = aC, with a = 0.9. From figure 14 it can be seen (squares) that this improves
