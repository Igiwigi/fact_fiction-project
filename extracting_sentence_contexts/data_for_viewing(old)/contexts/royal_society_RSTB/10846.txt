Genome stability and integrity are crucial for maintaining cellular and organis-
mal homeostasis [1,2]. To ensure the stability of the genome, cells use
specialized DNA damage response (DDR) pathways that manage different
types of DNA lesions by promoting DNA damage signalling and repair, activi-
ties that counteract the potentially adverse effects of DNA damage [2]. DNA
double-strand breaks (DSBs) represent a particularly deleterious type of DNA
lesion. An inability to repair DSBs can trigger chromosome loss and cell death,
while misrepaired DSBs can lead to mutations and chromosomal aberrations
such as translocations. Collectively, defects in DSB repair can result in genome
instability. The significance of the DDR is highlighted by the fact that dysfunc-
tional DDR pathways can promote human diseases including cancer, ageing
and neurodegenerative disorders [2]. In mammalian cells, DSBs are repaired
by two dominant pathways, canonical non-homologous end joining (c-NHE))
and homologous recombination (HR) [3,4]. C-NHE] involves the direct re-ligation
of two broken DNA ends together without a DNA template, whereas HR
engages a homologous DNA sequence as a template to repair DNA (figure 1).
Alternatively, other DSB repair pathways including alternative NHEJ (alt-
NHE)) or single-strand annealing (SSA) may be used to repair DSBs although
study. these pathways are considered more mutagenic [5,6]. How the repair of a DSB

is channelled into one of these specific pathways is a fundamental question. Sev-
