These figures suffice to show the great range of yariation as to the number of individual plants found
under different cireumstances according to the intensity of the struggle and competition between them on
a given area; and they bring out the fact that the number is less in proportion as the number of gspecies
is less. That is to say, complexity of herbage is an indication of feeble competition, and hence the greater
number of individual plants; whilst a small number of species is most probably associated with more
active strnggle, greater luxuriance of individual plants, and therefore a 8maller number in a given area. Darwis, in his © Origin of Species,” chapter 3, alludes to the same fact in these words: * 'The struggle
almost invariably will be most seyere between the individuals of the same species, for they frequent the
8@me districts, require the same food and are exposed to the same dangers.”
