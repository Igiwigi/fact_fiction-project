The following figures resulted for
the durations of positive and negative pre-discharge gradients:

There is a trace in these figures of an effect such as Simpson and Scrase
suggested, i.e. the preponderance of duration of negative gradient in these storms was
slightly less when the storm centre was very close than when it was slightly more
distant. It must be noted, however, that the effect is only found here when the pre-
discharge gradient is rather small; when the gradient exceeds 5000 V/m. the pre-
ponderance of negative gradients is as high as ever when the storm centre is very close. An attempt will now be made to sum up the facts which have definitely emerged
for this group of storms from the study of the pre-discharge gradient. The pre-discharge potential gradient beneath a storm may have any value from
zero to 10,000 V/m. The latter value is occasionally but only rarely exceeded.
