Behavioural ecologists tend to focus on the evolutionary
causes and consequences of innovation, and thus on innovation
as a functional product rather than its underlying processes.
However, this theme issue, as well as work elsewhere (e.g.
[10]), shows that the questions asked regarding innovation
have begun to cross disciplinary boundaries, and the utility of
these approaches. For example, knowledge about the cognitive
processes underlying innovation, their costs and their interde-
pendence with other traits, allows a behavioural ecologist to
consider what must evolve for innovation to happen. This cross-
ing of field boundaries is demonstrated by the fact that
a number of the papers in this issue are co-authored by
multi-disciplinary teams (e.g. [67,69]).

We believe that such collaborations will benefit the field both
in terms of direct findings from their endeavours, but also in
terms of fertilizing ideas across disciplines. This may result in
consensus regarding definitions, terminology, experimental
techniques and analytical protocols, and the commentators on


the current theme issue point to some important gaps [66,80]. Authorsâ€™ contributions. All authors wrote the paper, revised the paper and
