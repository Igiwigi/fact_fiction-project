Figure 5. Bond albedo determinations of the giant planets. Shown are the Bond albedos of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune,
from left to right. Values from Voyager data are shown in blue with 1o error bars. The data for Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
Neptune are based on Hanel et ai. [80], Hanel et al. [81], Peal et al. [21] and Pearl & Conrath [22], respectively. The red value for
Jupiter is from Cassini fly-by data [79]. (Online version in colour.)

5. Should we keep calling Uranus and Neptune the ‘ice giants’?

Often Uranus and Neptune are referred to as the ‘ice giants.’ The origin of the name is probably
linked to the mean densities of the planets which are comparable to the density of water, and due
to the fact that they are located at large radial distances where volatile materials can condense to
form ices (water, ammonia, methane).

However, we actually do not know if the compositions of Uranus and Neptune are dominated
by these materials, and even Pluto seems to consist of more rock than ice [84]. Indeed it was shown
that the observed properties of the planets can be fit also with a rock-dominated composition
[63], and recently, it has been suggested that Neptune could be a ‘rock-giant’ based on measured
atmospheric abundances (see Teanby et al. [85] and references therein for further details). Also,
although the argument that the planets must consist of large fractions of water to have high
enough electrical conductivities (ionic/super-ionic water) to generate their magnetic fields is
convincing (e.g. Redmer et al. [86]), it is yet to be determined how much water is required and
whether other materials could contribute to the ionic interior.
