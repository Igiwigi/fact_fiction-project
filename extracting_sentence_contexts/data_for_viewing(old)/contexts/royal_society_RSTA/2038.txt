Example 3.1. We present a numerical example corresponding to the creep test, i.e. a(t, L) = H(t)
where H is the Heaviside step function and L is the length of the rod made of viscoelastic material
described by (2.2). In the first case, we assume that (2.12) holds, while in the second case we
assume that both (2.12) and (2.13) hold.

Case 1. a = 6 =0.7, a, = by =1, az = 0.5, by = 1. For these values of parameters condition
(2.12) is satisfied while (2.13) is violated.
Case 2. a = B =0.7, a, =b; = 1, ay = 0.3, bp = 1. As for the previous case, for this value of
parameters condition (2.12) is satisfied while (2.13) is violated.
Case 3. a=B =0.7, a, =b, =1, a2 =0.5, by =0.25. For this case, the Bagley—Torvik
conditions (2.12) and (2.13) are satisfied.

— Case 4. We take a = 8 =0.7, a1 = by =az2 =b2 = 1.0, which is, in fact, the classical Hook
case.

In figure 1, we show ¢ as a function of time f € [0,3], for Cases 1, 3 and 4. We note that in Case 3,
for small times the solution is concave curve and ‘above’ the classical Case 4 case. In Case 1, the
solution is convex curve and ‘under’ the classical Case 4.
