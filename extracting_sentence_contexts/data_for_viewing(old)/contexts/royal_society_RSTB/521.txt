In the case of the Cupuliferee the occurrence seems to be universal. It has been
observed in the most widely distant localities, at very different altitudes, in very
different aspects, in soils of the most varied geological character, and with very varied
amounts of humus, with great variation in the associated herbage, and even in a
flower-pot. The growth is perhaps the most luxuriant on chalk soils. It is also the
more developed in the first 2 inches, or the richer-in-humus layer of the soil.

The occurrence of a fungus on the roots of certain trees has indeed been recorded
before. It has sometimes been considered to be connected with a diseased condition,
though it has also been noticed on healthy trees. â€˜The observations have, however,
not before been generalised.

Frank considers that the conditions are those of true symbiosis. He in fact
concluded that the chlorophyllous tree acquires the carbon, and the fungus the water
and the mineral matters, that is the soil nutriment.

Frank did not refer to nitrogen. But there is no reason to suppose that the
fungus could not, as do the fungi in the case of fairy rings for example, avail itself of
the organic nitrogen of the soil.

Here then we have a mode of accumulation of soil nutriment by some green-leaved
plants, which so far allies them very closely to fungi themselves. Indeed, it is by
an action on the soil which characterises non-chlorophyllous plants, and by virtue of
which they are enabled to take up nutriment not available to most green-leaved
plants, that the chlorophyllous plant itself acquires its soil-supplies of nutriment.
