Example 2
Take as an example the problem considered by Fox & Southwell (1941), of finding the

deflexion of a thin square plate, clamped at its edges and loaded uniformly on one face. The

differential equation is given by hs oe iar (B. 6)
= : y

and the boundary conditions by

w=0, dw/dv=0 on x safe ick dn (B. 7)

By symmetry it is only necessary to consider one-eighth of the square; it is also convenient
to take the constant in (B. 6) to be 25,600. The finite-difference equation corresponding to
(B. 5) is then given by

20w) — 85, + 25, +S5—25,600h4 +A = 0,)

A= —$(80,2+80,y) +--+ J vaio

and fictitious points will be eliminated by the use of the formula for r = 6 in table 1. With
an interval h = } the configuration is identical with that of figure 9, and corresponds also
to figure 18 of Fox & Southwell (1941) (in which all the values of w should be multiplied by
the factor 0-4096 to reproduce the exact conditions of the present example). The main concern at present is to show how accuracy is improved, on a relatively coarse
_ mesh, by the use of more complicated but more accurate finite-difference equations, and it
is therefore undesirable to introduce errors, of the type discussed in §5, due to inadequate
relaxation of the simultaneous equations.
