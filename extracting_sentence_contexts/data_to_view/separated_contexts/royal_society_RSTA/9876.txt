In the ash beds of the 1902 eruptions there are a limited number of andesitic rocks
which present some remarkable characters which seem to indicate that they have
undergone alteration of an unusual type. These rocks are milky white or pale grey,
often with dark patches which represent the ferro-magnesian minerals. Many of
them are brecciform; in fact, they look like whitened or bleached tuffs. It is
dificult to prepare microscopic sections of them, as they fall to pieces when being
mounted. Under the microscope they prove to be full of quartz which occurs only in the
matrix and not as phenocrysts (Plate 26, fig. 5).
