Cn is then computed in terms of some subtle intersection theory on the moduli
space of bundles with this characteristic class. The function Z has a remarkable
symmetry property. It is invariant under the transformation t—> —1/t. More
generally, it turns out to be given by a modular form for the group SZ(2,Z).
These symmetries obviously impose strong constraints on the coefficients c,,.
Directly related to this are the S-duality conjectures of Sen (1994) on what are
to the mathematician spaces of rational functions p/q, where q= z* + a)z"? +
--++ qa, and the resultant of p and q is one. The action of a kth root of unity
@ picks out eigenspaces in the cohomology with eigenvalue w’ for 0 < ¢< k. The
S-duality property implies that on the sum of these cohomology spaces for all k
there is an action of SL(2,Z) compatible with linear transformations of the vector
(k,£). This linkage between parts of the cohomology of different spaces is quite
alien to the traditional topologist, but can in fact be shown mathematically.
The group SZ(2,Z) and modular forms appear frequently also in what are
called ‘wall-crossing’ formulae for Donaldson invariants—jumps in the invari-
ants when passing from one generic regime to another. Wall-crossing in other
moduli problems has generated a new area in geometry where the naive descrip-
tion of a partition function as a generating function for counting objects has to
be replaced by more sophisticated ways of counting and encapsulating the data.

7. Thinking big

One problem for mathematicians is that the functional integrals that form the
basis of many of the above approaches, and in which the many exotic types of
symmetries are more obviously present, are as yet not rigorously defined.
