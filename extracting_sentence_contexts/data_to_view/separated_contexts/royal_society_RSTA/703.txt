The
magnitude of the density difference is dependent on the mass per volume relationship
of the material, being greater the greater the mass per volume. The density
difference could not be destroyed by mechanical stirring, and it remained unchanged
during a period as long as six hours of continuous stirring. That the stirring was
effective was visibly demonstrated by the fact that just below the critical tempera-
ture downward streaming of the liquid in the vapour phase was produced each
time the float (WmNKLER and Maass, 1933) was lifted above the meniscus. This
showed that the liquid was actually carried up into the vapour region. This
intermingling of the upper and lower “ phases » due to stirring must, of course, have
been just as effective above the critical temperature.
