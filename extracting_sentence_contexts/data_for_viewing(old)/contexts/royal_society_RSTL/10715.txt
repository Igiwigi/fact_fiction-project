Remarks on Experiment XXTIT.

In the first place, we may direct our attention to the diminution of the vibration-
period produced by rest after repeated vibrations ; this seems to be almost, if not
quite, as pronounced as it is in the case of iron, the vibration-period gradually
diminishing from 6'010 s8econds to 5:900 seconds, and this, too, in spite of the fact
that the same vibrator had been used several times previously with the wire, and had
been carefully adjusted at the commencement of the experiment.*

In the second place may be noticed the diminution of the logarithmic deerement
which attends the above-mentioned diminution of the vibration-period, and that the
former of the two is very much greater than the latter. This last is easily accounted
for if we as8ume with WrIEpEMANN that the internal friction is due to the to-and-fro
rotation of the molecules about their axes, and not, as is the torsional elasticity of
the wire, mainly upon the force necessary to alter the distances separating the centres
of the molecules.

Thirdly, the effect, of © elastic fatigue” becomes less and less apparent as the ampli-
