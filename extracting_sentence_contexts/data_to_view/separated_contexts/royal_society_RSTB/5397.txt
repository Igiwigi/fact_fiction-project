The vascular supply to the appendages arises in the form of closed rings nipped off, as in
“C.” australis and C. antiqua, alternately from the two margins of the petiolar strand
(Plate 50, fig. 9; Plate 51, fig. 15). But it is interesting to observe that the points of
origin of these rings are not strictly the lateral, but the dorso-lateral, margins of the
primary bundle—a fact which betrays the Asterochlena-like behaviour of a petiolar
strand otherwise typically clepsydroid. The outward course of the aphlebia-traces
through the petiolar cortex is always dorso-lateral, as in “‘ C.” australis, Asterochlana
lara, and other zygopterids. So far as I have seen, the aphlebia-trace never undergoes a dichotomy within the
petiolar cortex, as it was observed to do in “ C.” australis.
