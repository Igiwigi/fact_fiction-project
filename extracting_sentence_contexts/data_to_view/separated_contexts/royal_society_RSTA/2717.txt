expressions for sky radiation hitherto obtained; in fact the whitish colour of the
sky near the horizon was considered by Ketyrn* to be an objection-to the theory of
scattering,

By calculating the values of the intensities of solar radiation which reaches the
earth’s surface for various zenith distances of the sun and for various wave-lengths,
and by integrating the curves so obtained, we obtain the values of the total intensity
of solar radiation reaching the two stations Mount Wilson and Washington. Taking
the value of the solar constant to be 1°922 calories per square centimetre per
minute,t the results are given in the same units and are calculated for solar
radiation incident on a plane normal to the sun’s rays as well as for the solar radiation
incident on a horizontal plane. The results are given in Tables VII.
