In other words, the effects in question occur equally well, whether
the electrodes be placed on the same radius of the umbrella—so causing the current to
traverse the muscle-fibres for the most part transversely—or placed on different,
though not widely separated radii, at points equi-distant from the circumference of
the nmbrella—so causing the current to traverse the musecle-fibres for the most part
longitudinally. TI. SECTION,

$ 1,—Allusion has already been made to the fact that in the contractile tissues of
Avurelia there are frequently to be observed immense differences in the force of the
contractions, according as the latter are originated by a strong or by a weak stimula-
tion ; that is to say, while a stimulus which is not below some certain degree of inten-
sity will always start a wave of strong contraction from any point of the tissue area
which may be chosen as the seat of stimulation, a weaker stimulus may start a wave
of contraction 80 feeble as to be scarcely perceptible. In some specimens of Aurelia
these waves of feeble contraction are more easily produced than in other specimens,
and occasionally it happens that they are 80 feeble as to be only rendered perceptible
by raising the tissue above the water and inclining the head at such an angle to their
level as admits of the eye receiving the reflection of light which falls upon their
glancing surface; as a response to each feeble stimulus a slight change in the glancing,
indicative of a slight contraction, may then be observed. It might reasonably be supposed that snch feeble waves of contraction would not
present much power of radiating through extensive areas of tissue; but, as a matter of
fact, they often travel quite as far and well as do the stronger waves.
