of which are cut off.
(2) It melts sharply at 134°-135° C. On heating above its melting point bubbles of
gas are given off which have been shown to be due to loss of water.
(3) The crystals obtained from ether and light petroleum contain solvent of crystalli-
sation which is lost very slowly on exposure to air, but much more rapidly at 100° C.

Determination of combining weight of hydrolysed substance “A” by titration.

It was recognized that if hydrolysed Substance “A” is a hydroxy-tricarboxylic
acid and if Substance “ A” is the lactone corresponding to it, then considerable difficulty
might be experienced in preparing a sample of perfectly pure hydrolysed “ A,” because
of the ease with which hydroxy acids of certain types are known to revert to the lactone.
This difficulty was further intensified by the fact that hydrolysed “ A” was known to
cling tenaciously to the solvent when a mixture of ether-light petroleum, which is the
best crystallising agent, was used in its preparation. An attempt to overcome this
difficulty by using chloroform as a solvent instead of ether gave the same result since
hydrolysed “ A ” clings to chloroform as tenaciously as to ether. The problem therefore
resolved itself into that of finding a method of removing the solvent from hydrolysed
“4” without at the same time removing water and hence re-forming Substance “A.”


THE BIOCHEMISTRY OF MICRO-ORGANISMS. 311

A sample of hydrolysed Substance “A,” free from solvent of crystallisation, and
containing a minimum of re-formed Substance “ A,”’ was finally obtained as follows :—
