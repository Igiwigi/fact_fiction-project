2.—An actually observed gain is positive proof that nitrogen has been assimilated,
either directly by the plants, or indirectly through the medium in which the roots
have developed. The failure of an experiment to show gain only proves non-assimila-
tion, if it is also proved that there was no liberation of nitrogen. The conflicting
results of various experimenters may probably be explained by the fact of such
liberation. 3.—The experiments do not show in what way the nitrogen is acquired. It must
have been taken up, either as free or combined nitrogen, either directly through the
foliage, or indirectly through the soil and nutritive solutions, and the roots.
