If the hemisection is made at the level of the 3rd dorsal this degeneration along
the lateral border of the posterior horn is not so well marked, presumably because
CLaRKe’s column is not well marked higher up in the dorsal region. (Vide a paper by
me in the ‘Journal of Anatomy and Physiol.,’ 1888, ‘‘CLtarKe’s Column in Man, the
Monkey, and the Dog.”)

I think these results strongly support the old views of Fiecusi¢ upheld by
K6.LLIKEk,* that the cells of CLaRKE’s vesicular column are connected not with efferent
fibres, but with an afferent system. The nerve processes of the cells of this column
run upwards and outwards to form the direct cerebellar tract of the same side. Another fact worthy of notice is the way in which the degenerated cerebellar tract
leaves the periphery in the upper cervical region, Professor ScHAFER tells me that
this quite agrees with his observations in conjunction with Franort on descending
degenerations resulting from cortical ablation. Many of these fibres which, in the
upper cervical region, lie outside the direct cerebellar tract are of the pyramidal
system. Tam also indebted to Professor ScHAFER and Dr.
