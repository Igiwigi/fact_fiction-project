1, vertebra at the level of the hind end of the large anterior lobe of the caudal fin. 2, vertebre
at the root of the caudal fin. 3, vertebre a short distance in front of the caudal fin. 4, vertebra
still farther forward, cloacal region.

a, hyaline cartilage (outer-zone cartilage); 4, fibrous tissue, the greatly elongated intervertebral
ligament ; ¢, fibrous septum, a product of the inner-zone cartilage—it is traversed in the middle
by the remains of the notochord; d, a two-layered circular plate, with fibro-cartilage between the
two layers of the plate; it represents the double cone, antero-posteriorly compressed ; ¢, calcified
ring, the last remnant of the double cone (see also fig. 5, B, e); f, watery jelly, the remains of the
notochord,

The arch-cartilages have calcified tesserse, and the fact that these are better
developed in the caudal than in the trunk region is a further argument in support of
the view that the trunk vertebre are in a degraded, and not in a primitive condition.
At the sides of the caudal vertebree, on a horizontal level with the middle of the
centrum, are calcified tracts that lie just external to the membrana elastica externa
(fig. 5, A, p’). These lateral tracts I reyard as having been produced by the
activity of the superficial perichondrium, and not by a fusion of neural and haemal
arch-cartilages ; they are, in fact, intermedialia, but, instead of being bulky wedges
as in the Carchariidse, they are reduced to the form of thin plates, K6uLrkxER’s
