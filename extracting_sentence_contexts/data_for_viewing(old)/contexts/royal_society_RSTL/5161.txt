But if Jupiter and Saturn, inſtead of refleQing the
whole of, the light, that falls upon! them, ſhould-in
fact reflect, only a part of it, as for example, only'a
fourth or ſixth (and this may. very poſſibly be the
caſe), we. muſt then increaſe the diſtances computed
above, in the. proportion of 2 or 2.2.to-1, to make
the Sun's light no more than-equal to theirs ; and his
parallax would. be leſs, in the fame proportion, than
thoſe, already mentioned ?. | ye :

Upon the, ſuppoſition then, that the fixed ſtars are
