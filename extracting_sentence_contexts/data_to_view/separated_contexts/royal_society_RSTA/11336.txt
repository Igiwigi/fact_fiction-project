Professor RryNnoxps further points out that the rate of this diffusion will depend on—

(1.) The natural internal diffusion of the fluid when at rest.

(2.) The eddies caused by visible motion which mix the fluid up and continually
bring fresh particles into contact with the surface, and that the combined effect of
these two causes may be expressed as follows ;—

where ¢ is the difference of temperature between the surface and the fluid, p is the
density of the fluid, v its velocity, and A and B constants depending on the nature
of the fluid; H being the heat transmitted per unit of surface in unit time. In the
sume paper experiments were described giving evidence in favour of the truth of the
above theory. . The chief dithculty in any experimental determination of the rate of transmission
in metal pipes, lies in the fact that the temperature of the surface of the pipe varies
from point to point along the pipe, and again tends to adjust itself by lateral con-
duction along the pipe. Hence, in order that any definite results may be obtained, it
is necessary that the temperature of the pipe shall be constant throughout its length. It occurred to the author that this result might be obtained in the following way :—
