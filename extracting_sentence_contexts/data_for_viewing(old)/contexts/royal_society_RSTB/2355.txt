It is by no means easy to find a complete explanation of all the phenomena pre-
sented by the absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide from a moving current of air
by the free surface of an absorbent, such as a solution of sodium hydroxide.

Supposing such a surface to be perfectly absorbent, that is to say, one which can
trap all the molecules of carbon dioxide which reach it in their excursions, allowing
none to be reflected, then any process of mechanical mixing of the air which would
produce a more rapid renewal of the impoverished layer above the liquid would tend
to diminish the thickness of this layer, to increase the gradient, and to produce a
more rapid absorption, which would only be limited by the mean square speed for the
carbon dioxide molecules, The fact that the limit of absorption is reached by a very
low velocity of air current, shows that we have to deal with a surface of very imper-
fect absorption, from which a very large proportion of the molecules must rebound,
just as they do from the non-absorbing surfaces of the retaining walls of the vessel.
That there should be a constant relation between the entrapped molecules and the
total number of molecules in unit volume of the superincumbent air, as shown by
the strict proportionality between absorption and the partial pressure of the carbon
dioxide, was perhaps to be expected, but the reason for the limited absorption is not
quite so evident.

The maximum amount of ‘177 cub. centim. of CO, per sq. centim, per hour absorbed
from ordinary air is almost exactly the quantity which a perfect absorbent should take
in for the same time and area when the density varies from the normal amount of ‘0003
