The additional
olution F is thus always zero and our solution is therefore the unique solution of the problem. By a similar argument it can be shown that our first form of solution, involving the pressure
‘opradient y(y, t) is also unique. In either form, once y or F is determined uniquely, the field
everywhere is then determined uniquely by equations (1) and either (7) or (9).
‘w Essentially, although the basic integral equation (15) and the resulting equation (25)
sao not have unique solutions, our solution is made unique by satisfying the condition that
