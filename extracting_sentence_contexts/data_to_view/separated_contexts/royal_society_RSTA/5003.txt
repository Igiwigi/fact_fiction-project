Calculations 15
were presented for carbide modification of o¢ and reversal of the decreasing Tc dependence on
¢-'/? for different carbide plate thicknesses in the range of 0.25 to 5 «ums. Interesting association DA
of larger carbide thickness and reduced sharpness of the temperature range for the transition tw
was pointed out by Petch, thus adding credence to the modified model of predicting Tc. In fact, :
Sandstrém & Bergstrém [37] had reported a relatively thicker 0.8 1m carbide thickness for the a
10m grain size microalloyed steel and this has very probably contributed to the higher than :3
predicted value of Tc shown in figure 5. :

The calculations reported by Petch for carbide modification of the grain size dependence of o&
were re-cast by Armstrong et al. [26] in terms of the reverse consideration of dependence on t. The
model description compared favourably with notched test results reported by Bowen & Knott
[51]. At the smallest t-values, a comparison was made with Petch’s DBTT predictions for the oé
dependence on ¢~!/?.
