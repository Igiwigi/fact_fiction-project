As the table shows, there are even Miscellaneezs which have yielded 1 per cent. or
more to the total produce in one or other of the separation-years on one or other of
the three plots 16, 19, 20, But the species reaching this degree of prominence are
nob the same on the three plots. There were, in fact, in the two years in question,
only five. which did 80 on plot 16, and only four which did 80 on either 19 or 20. These were on the respective plots as shown below ; and as the results of a single
geagon might be misleading, they are in each case given in the order, not as in the

atest separation-year, but of their average prominence over the two years ;â€”
