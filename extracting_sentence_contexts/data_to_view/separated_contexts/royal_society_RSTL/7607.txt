The close-plane or reciproca] singularity z=1 is (like the pinch-plane) a torsal
Plane, meeting the surface in a line twice and in a residual curve; the distinction is that
the line and curve have an intersection P lying on the spinode curve; the close-plane is
thus a spinode plane; it meets the consecutive spinode plane in a line  passing through
P, and which is not the tangent of the residual curve. In the reciprocal figure, the
reciprocal of the close-plane is on the cuspidal curve, and is a close-point; the reciprocal

of the point P is the cuspidal tangent plane; that of the line w the tangent of the cus-
pidal curve; that of the tangent of the residual curve the cotriple tangent ; that of the
torsal line the cotangent.
39. The torsal line of a close-plane is not a mere torsal line ; in fact by what precedes
it appears that the surface and the Hessian intersect in this line, counting not twice
but three times, and it is thus that the reduction in the order of the spinode curve

caused by the close-plane is =. PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON RECIPROCAL SURFACES. 213
