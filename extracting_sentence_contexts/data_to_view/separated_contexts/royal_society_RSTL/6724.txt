Sometimes several unite to form one very fine fibre,
E which can be followed for some distance upon, and very close to, the outer part of a
5 5 wide dark-bordered fibre. But I have many specimens in which both straight and spiral
Z fibres are exceedingly thin and of equal diameter, others in which the straight is much
Z thicker than the spiral fibre, and a few in which the diameter of the spiral fibre or fibres
E is even greater than that of the straight fibre.
& - Thave traced the spiral fibres continuous with @ dark-bordered fibre in several instances. 3 A very conclusive specimen showing this fact is represented in Plate XXXIIL. fig. 1, in
S which both straight and spiral fibre were continuous with dark-bordered fibres; als in
