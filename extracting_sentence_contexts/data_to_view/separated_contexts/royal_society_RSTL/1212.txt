The basis of potash I find oxidates in carbonic acid and
decomposes it, and produces charcoal when heated in contact
with carbonate of lime. It likewise oxidates in muriatic acid ;
but I have had no opportunity of making the experiment with
sufficient precision to ascertain the results. In sciences kindred to chemistry, the knowledge. of the
nature of the alkalies, and the analogies arising in consequence,
will open many new views; they may lead tothe s8olution of
many problems in''geology, and shew that agents may have
operated in the formation of rocks and earths which have not
hitherto been suspected to exist:

It would be easy to pursue” the''speculative part of this
