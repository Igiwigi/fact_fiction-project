the laws of polarisation, Sc. This remark, however, is by no means an explanation of
the fact. It is merely a different mode of expressing the
fact, that the cubical and octohedral crystals have no double
refraction; for the sphere is applicable to the optical action
of air and all other fluids, whether aeriform or liquid, which
have not the property of double refraction. The discovery of the remains of polarising axes in a great
number of crystals of this class, completely proves that,
like all other crystallized bodies, they actually possess the
doubly refracting and polarising structure, but that this
structure entirely vanishes in some specimens, by the equi-
librium of the forces in every point of the crystal, and
reappears in some specimens when that equilibrium is not
complete. The principles of the resolution of polarising forces which
we have already explained, indicate the manner in which this
equilibrium is effected.
