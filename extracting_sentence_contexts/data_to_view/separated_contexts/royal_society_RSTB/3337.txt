W. HEAPE ON THE PROPORTION OF THE SEXES

element is so small in any province that it may be disregarded. Reference to previous
Census returns shows that the proportion of coloured to whites has diminished in the
last half century. In 1861, coloured numbered 603,046 against whites 793,484, from
which fact it is held that we have here another illustration, still more obvious in the
United States, of the inability of an inferior race to hold its own in competition with
whites (Census 1899). This conclusion, I will show below, requires some modification,
It would seem probable that while the great increase of whites is, to some extent,
due to immigration, the reduction of coloured people has been largely effected by the
abolition of slavery, and that where the existing coloured population fail to maintain
their position the cause is to be ascribed more to the conditions under which they
are allowed by the governing white class to live rather than to any inherent inability
to compete with them. GALLENZA (1873) describes the native whites in Habana as poor creatures, both
morally and physically, and I find little in more modern works to lead one to suppose
there was any great change in those inhabiting the towns up to the time of the war.
