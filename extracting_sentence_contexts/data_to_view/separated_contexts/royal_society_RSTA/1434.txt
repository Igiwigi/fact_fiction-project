By their nature, multiscale models are composed of individual at-scale (or single scale) model
components. Each at-scale component is frequently a complex parallel software developed over
many years. This fact has motivated a shift away from monolithic approaches to multiscale
model development and towards more heterogeneous component-based approaches, capable of
incorporating existing at-scale models with minimal software modifications. One such approach,
the cooperative parallelism programming model, is a task-based multiple-program multiple-

data approach to parallel programming [9]. In cooperative parallelism, single unit computation : =
tasks named symponents (a portmanteau of simulation and component) are executed by a : =
runtime system.
