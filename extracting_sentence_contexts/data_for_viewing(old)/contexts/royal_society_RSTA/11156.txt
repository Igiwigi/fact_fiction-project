Possibly this may throw some light on the fact that the effect of cutting such slits
into the material does not always give in practice the reduction in the torsional
rigidity which should have been expected from Saint-VENANT's results for the circle.
Clearly the depth of the keyway is a factor of the very first importance, and keyways
of moderate depth will produce a comparatively small effect on the torsional rigidity.

It is also shown that the effect of cutting two equal and opposite slits is practically
equal, in the two cases which I have calculated (namely, «= 7/6 and «= 7/2), to twice
the effect of a single slit.

It seems, therefore, that the study of these sections brings to light several
interesting facts in the theory of elasticity, and will well repay the trouble involved
in dealing with the long and somewhat tedious algebra and arithmetic which lead to
these results,

§ 3. Statement of Notation, cde.

In what follows the axis of z will be taken parallel to the generators, the axes of
and y in one of the terminal cross-sections.

The origin, however, will not necessarily be at the centroid of the cross-section.

The shifts of any point of the material parallel to the axis will be denoted as usual
hy u, v, w, and for the stresses I shall use the notation of TopHUNTER and PEARSON'S
