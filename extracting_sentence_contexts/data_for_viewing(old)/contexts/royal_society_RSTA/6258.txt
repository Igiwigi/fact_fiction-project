viral load

Figure 5. Epidemic curve and viral load distributions for a rising, stationary and falling epidemic. (a) Epidemic curve showing
the susceptible (5), infectious (/) and removed (R) observables for a population of 10 000 individuals calibrated for a reproduction
number of 3. Envelopes show 1 and 2s.d. over 128 simulations. Marked on the graph are two pairs of time points where the mean
number of infectious individuals are equal as the epidemic rises and falls. (b) Viral load distribution at different points of the
epidemic trajectory showing a rising t € {20, 30}, stationary t = 42 and falling t € {56, 66} epidemic. Viral load in arbitrary
logarithmic units. The probability masses of distributions are shifted to the left (lower viral loads) for a rising epidemic and the
distribution for a falling epidemic is in fact bimodal with most infected individuals on the point of recovery but a significant
number with slowly decaying high viral loads. (Online version in colour.)

effectively model historic behaviour and predict the outcomes of future interventions in a way
that reveals causality, flexibility to update both the model structure and calibration of parameters
as new information becomes available, computational tractability, and ease of explanation to
policy-makers and the public. The approach presented here has significant advantages across
many of these desiderata though there is also still work to be done. Our emphasis on modularity
and compositionality facilitates the flexibility to update model structure: individual rules or entire
sub-models can be changed or substituted locally, without requiring global changes. Indeed, it
is possible to analyse the dependencies between rules to determine precisely the extent to which
modifications to one part of the model may require modification to other parts. The modular
structure means that it is often possible to calibrate sub-models individually, saving the great
