This is an active area of research for both
biologists and engineers, and one that is particularly pertinent
for micro air vehicles (MAVs)—insect- and bird-sized drones,
with maximal dimensions of 15cm and speeds of around
10ms° |, which experience flight control challenges. Ortega-
Jimenez et al. [15] suggest that flight research in hummingbirds
presents opportunities for advancing our understanding of
aerial manoeuvrability, as the flight performance of this group

far exceeds that of similar-sized MAVs. In fact, the kinematics
of hovering in hummingbirds are strikingly similar to those
seen in other hovering animals such as honeybees, hawkmoths
and fruit flies, showing that similar solutions can operate over a
range of scales (which may be the result of constraints in this
case) [62]. The hovering performance of Drosophila melanogaster
has been exceptionally well parametrized, and Dickenson &
Muijres [62] review this here, as well as the aerodynamic, biome-
chanical and neurological underpinnings of the flight
manoeuvrability of these tiny insects. These advances are likely to be crucial for the further devel-
opment of flapping-wing MAVs, an active research area, also
reviewed by Liu et al. [61], which has biomimetics at its
heart.
