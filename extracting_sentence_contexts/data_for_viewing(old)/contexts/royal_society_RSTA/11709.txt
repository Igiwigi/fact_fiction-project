material bodies on one another, and the material stresses and physical changes
thereby produced. As in the preceding papers, the quantitative results are to a
large extent independent of any special theory of the constitution of matter, such as
is here employed to bind together and harmonize the separate groups of phenomena,
and to form a mental picture of their mutual relations; so far as they are electric
they may be based directly on MaxweEtt’s equations of the electric field in free
space, which form a sufficient description of the free eether, and have been verified by
experiment. In the FarapAy-MAxwe t theory, however, as usually expounded, an
explanation of these equations is found, explicitly or tacitly, in an assumption that the
wether is itself polarizable in the same manner as a material medium, and ether is in
fact virtually considered to be matter ; on the present theory the equations for free
space are an analytical statement of the ultimate dynamical definition of the
continuous «ethereal medium, and the polarization of material bodies with the
resulting forcive are deduced from the relation of their molecules to this medium in
which they have their being. f

10. In the modern treatment of material dynamics, as based on the principle
of energy, the notion of configuration is, as above explained, fundamental. The
potential energy, from which the forces are derived, is a function of the mutual
configurations of the parts of the material system. In the case of forces of elasticity
the internal energy is primarily a function of the mutual configurations of the
individual molecules, from which a regular or organised part (§ 49 infra) is separated
which is expressible in terms of the change of configuration of the differential
