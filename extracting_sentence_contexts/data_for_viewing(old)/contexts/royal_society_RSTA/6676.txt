and the aerofoil is assumed to lie, to the first order, in the plane y=0. The x-axis is then
along the span of the aerofoil.

We assume that the deviations of the velocity components, pressure and density from their
steady values are infinitesimally small, so that their squares can be neglected. The compo-
nents of the velocity disturbance will be denoted by (w, v, w). Using the Euler equations, and
the continuity equation, together with the equation of state for the gas, assumed perfect,

and the adiabatic condition, we can easily find the equation which must be satisfied by the
velocity potential from which (u, v, w) can be derived. In fact, for steady motion we have
