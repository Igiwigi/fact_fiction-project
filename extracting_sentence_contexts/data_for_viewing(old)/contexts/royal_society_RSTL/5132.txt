After a considerable time the fluid lost its fine green colour, as is very often the case
with solutions of leaf-green, and became yellowish brown, but the red and yellow
dispersions $till continued.

When the fluid was examined by the fourth method, it was found that the red
rays dispersed a red, just as in a s0lution of Jeaf-green. The additional dispersion
which was $80 conspicuous in this fluid began almost abruptly about the fixed
line D. When it was first observed, the refrangibility of the orange dispersed light
could hardly, if at all, be separated from that of the active light. As the lens moved
on, the orange beam rapidly grew brighter, and yellow entered into it ; and now it
was easy to see that the beam of falsely dispersed light lay at its more refrangible
limit. The orange and yellow dispersed beam was brightest at about D3 E; but
though it decreased in intensity it could be traced far beyond that point, in fact,
throughout the spectrum.

63. I have generally found that when a copious dispersion commences almost
abruptly at a certain point of the spectrum, it is followed by a band of absorption in

the transmitted light. This law did not seem applicable to the orange dispersion
exhibited by the solution just mentioned ; but then it is to be remembered that the
solution contained a quantity of chlorophyll, which produces absorption bands with
such energy that it would naturally mask the bands which might be due to an-
