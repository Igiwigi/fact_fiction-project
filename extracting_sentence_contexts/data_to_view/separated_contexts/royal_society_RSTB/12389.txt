My suggestion is that this is where we need to consider the
conditions of application of the model. Within a dependence
account of explanation, we are interested in information
about what the explanatory target depends on. When we are
explaining physical facts, some information about how the
target would have been different had other conditions been
different can be expected to come from within the explanatory

model itself. However, once we recognize that explanatory =
