The reconstructions illustrated here at reduced size were prepared for the final
report on the Sinanthropus mandibule to be published shortly in Paleontologia Sinica,
Series D. In view of the subsequent discovery of the Locus B2 jaw fragment, in which
it would seem that a considerable portion of the adult symphysis is represented, it is
hoped that dioptrographic reconstruction of the adult Sinanthropus jaw corrected as
to symphysis detail may be included in the final report to be issued this autumn. With regard to the technique employed in making these reconstructions, it may be
well to stress the fact that they represent dioptrographic projections, not perspective
drawings. The various fragments were oriented with regard to three sides of a glass
cube, with the mean occlusal plane horizontal. Further adjustment of orientation
with regard to the mid-sagittal plane was then made in comparison with both recent
and fossil hominid material.
