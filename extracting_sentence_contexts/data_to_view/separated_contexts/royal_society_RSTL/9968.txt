Phoof-shaped depression edged with a row of protuberances acting as suckers, I could

not help comparing this remarkable structure, s0 utterly unlike anything in Fishes or

Ganoids, to the Cyclostomes, with which it has a striking analogy. This organ is also

used by Lepidosteus as a sucker, and the moment the young Fish is hatched he
