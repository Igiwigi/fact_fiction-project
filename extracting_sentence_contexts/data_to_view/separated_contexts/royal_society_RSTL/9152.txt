The
action of sulphuric acid and manganic oxide or tartaric acid does not yield a pure
gubstance. The action of oxalic acid on formiate of barium yields a distillate which at
first is different from the product of other processes in being free from a slight but
peculiar odour, and which it is highly probable is not proper to formic acid, but belongs
to some ever present impurity. On continuing the distillation, the usual smell was
developed, which fact seems to show that heat canses a change in the formic acid. It
is said by Lori (vide Warrs * Dictionary of Chemistry,‚Äù vol. vi.) that formic acid
