None of these measurements depend very much on the absolute readings of mercury
thermometers except the Clark cell. The temperature of the standard-resistance was
always taken with the thermometer used in its calibration with the standard ohm,
which in turn had such a small temperature coefficient that it made it of very little
importance whether the thermometer used to obtain its temperature was in error by
as much as ‘5°. As a matter of fact, by direct comparison, all the thermometers used
agreed with our standard thermometer to within ‘1°. The thermometer used to
obtain the temperature of the jacket-water between 0° and 50° C., was a new Miiller
