But to form a spectrum in which the invisible rays shall be com-
pletely separated from the visible ones, a narrow slit or a small aperture is necessary ;
and this circumstance renders the amount of heat separable by prismatic analysis very
limited. If we wish to ascertain what the intensely concentrated invisible rays can
accomplish, we must devise some other mode of detaching them from their visible com-
panions. We must, in fact, discover a substance which shall filter the composite radia-
tion of a luminous source by stopping the visible rays and allowing the invisible ones
free transmission. Could we obtain a black elementary body thoroughly homogeneous, and with all its

* At a future day I hope to subject this question to a more seyere examination. 8 PROFESSOR TYNDALL ON CALORESCENCE.
