the neryures, or at right angles to them. Similarly, if the observer looks parallel to the
neryures, but from the apex of the wing to the base, the colour may be quite different
from that seen when looking from the base towards the apex. This is generally due
to the fact that the scales are not always set in the same plane as the surface of the
wing, but are frequently inclined to it at a definite angle. Thus, though an observer
is holding the wing at right angles to his line of vision, the scales may still make an

angle with it. In the case of Ornithoptera poseidon and others, there are two dark
velvety patches on the forewings, which owe their appearance partly to the angle at
which the scales are attached to the wing, but chiefly to the fact that the scales form
rows which run at right angles to the nervures instead of parallel, as do the other scales.

(b) Shape and Configuration of the Scales.â€”These factors are frequently the
cause of the change of colour seen on varying the position of the wing. In this way
Morpho cypris, the shape of whose scales is convex, may be made to vary from dull
purple to electric blue. The well-known appearance like shot silk, shown by Apatura
iris, LINN., which causes it to seem bright violet in one direction, but black in the
opposite, is said to be due toa similar reason. The point of every scale is curved
upwards (fig. 1, E, p. 7) like the prow of a gondola, so that only by looking at it
from the root should the upper iridescent surface be seen. From the opposite direction
the observer should only perceite the brown underside of the upturned tip. This
suggestion was made by WALTER,* and it seems to account very well for the appearance
