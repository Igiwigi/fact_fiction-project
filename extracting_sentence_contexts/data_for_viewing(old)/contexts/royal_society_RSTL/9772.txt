diminution in the 8ize of the granules is very marked in cells in which the outer Zone
takes up the larger part of the cell. After great activity there is also an obvious
diminution in the size of the cells, and although it is difficult to be certain of the
changes which take place in the firs 8tages of activity, T have little doubt that the
diminution in the size of the cell begins with the development of the clear outer zone.

In specimens treated with osmic acid there is another effect of activity to be seen,
viz. : the cell-substance stains more deeply than during rest. In the cesophageal
glands the tint of staining is nob in 80 constant a relation to the amount of secretion
produced as in some other glands, the extent to which the tint deepens seems to vary
as the stimulation is produced by digestible food or by mechanical stimulation. These
and some other apparent causes of variation have not been closely determined, but the
main fact of an increase in the depth of staining has always been obvious,

It was stated by SEWALL and myself* that absolute alcohol added to the fresh
teased-out gland altered the normal appearances; and I have said above that the
granules are in part dissolved. Nevertheless, alcohol specimens of cesophageal glands
taken during digestion show the two zones in the gland-cells ; the non-granular zone
stains with carmine, and thus specimens can be obtained (Plate 77, fig. 8), which,
except for the smaller size of the cells, closely resemble similarly prepared specimens of
the pancreas. Ib is almost unnecessary to remark that the © granules” of the inner
zone in alcohol specimens are not the granules present in the fresh gland. With Zeiss',
oc. 2, obj. E or F, the granular zone appears as a fine network.

Nothing very definite can be said as to the time after feeding at which the changes
