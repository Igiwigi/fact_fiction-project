The test of an echinoid has a complex structure and shows a number of definable
characters, although, unfortunately, far fewer than are to be found in a vertebrate skull. A large number of such characters are necessary to enable reliable lineages to be drawn
up. This fact explains why our knowledge of the phylogeny of the vertebrates is so much
better than that of any invertebrate phylum. In the outcome, as will be seen, Micraster
had just enough definable characters to enable useful conclusions to be drawn. In addition
the fossils of Micraster in some parts of the English chalk are reasonably abundant and
usually uncrushed, while often the matrix is soft and the specimens may be prepared easily
and without damage.
