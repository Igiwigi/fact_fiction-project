In the weak form of trading operators (2.6), we can
resort to a second order Taylor expansion of the test function g(v*) around v, obtaining

9(0") = (0) = 6"(v) (WF = v) + 5 9") (W* =v?
1
= o'(w) [e (jw — Fev) + gv] + 5 9") [e? Fw — Fe? + jv? + 2enjv (Fw — Hw),

where i =@ v + (1 — 6) v* for some suitable 6 ¢ [0, 1]. Bearing in mind that random variables nj;

The fact that all higher order terms of the Taylor expansion, including the ones involving moments
of the random variables, are O() and thus vanish in this limit may be rigorously proved [9]. By
integration by parts, we can pass the derivatives from the test function to the distribution g;(v)
and, under the assumptions that g;(0,t) =0 (no individuals with zero wealth) and g;(v,0) has
moments M, bounded for s = 2 + 5 for some 6 > 0 (see [9,19] for further details), we get

Concerning the transfer operators, notice that the interaction rule (2.26) in the present scaling
implies g(v*) = g(v) + O(e) = y(vs) + Ole). Consequently, taking into account that pr and ph are
O(e), for the operators relevant to transfer (a) we have

The contributions due to operators relevant to transfers (b), (c) and (d) may be analogously
computed.
