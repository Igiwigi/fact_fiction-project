These two years were selected because, when character figures were employed, the
one, 1895, showed the 27—28-day period specially clearly, while the other, 1894,
showed it less clearly than perhaps any other year. The investigation based on H
ranges took account only of the 5 representive days a month and the 35 following days.
The results are given in Table XII., accompanied by the corresponding results previously
obtained from the character figures. To facilitate comparison, both sets of figures are
expressed as percentages of the arithmetic mean value derived from the 36 columns.

In the case of 1894 two sets of H range figures are given. The former and the
character figures given depend on all the 60 selected days of the year. In obtaining
the second set of H range figures, all ranges were omitted which exceeded 200y, and
a mean was taken from the remaining figures in each column. The object was to see
the effect of omitting a few of the larger magnetic storms—all, in fact, which gave H
ranges in excess of the largest range of 1895.

The data from 1895, though naturally not as smooth as the 3-year and 11-year
data in Table XI., show the 27—28-day period quite as clearly. It is as unmistakable
in the range as in the character figures. Again both range and character figures
afford distinct indications of a 13—14-day period, which it will be remembered
appeared in Table XI. only in the group of years containing 1895.

In 1894 the character figures and the range figures (i) both show not a peak at day
n+27 or n+28, but a high plateau extending from about day n+25 to day n+34.
The range figures, in fact, would seem to favour a Schmidt, or 30-day period, rather
than a 27—28-day period. The reason of this is clear on examining the range
