In this hypothesis it is clear why the turpentine does not stop the in-
duced contraction, but it still remains doubly obscure why with the extremely thin
plate of mica this should take place. I have made an experiment by covering a
galvanoscopic frog, placed upon a plate of glass, with a sheet of mica; the electric
discharge of a jar passes between the knobs of the universal discharger upon the sheet
of mica, and the contractions in the galvanoscopic frog are aroused. I hall not
occupy myself at this moment in analysing these facts ; it is sufficient at present to
prove that there must be induced contractions through the plate of mica if the occa-
sion of the phenomenon were an electric discharge. I will add finally, that I have
very many times attempted, and always uselessly, to awaken the contractions in the
frog, by holding the nerve of the galvanoscopic frog near and almost in contact with
a metallic conductor traversed by the electric current. To place myself in favourable cireumstances that the induced current may be com-
plete in the frog, I prepare it in such a manner that a long nervous filament (that is,
one of the lumbar plexuses with its continuation in the thigh) may be uncovered.
