SIR ANDREW NOBLE: RESEARCHES ON EXPLOSIVES. 209

Mark I (for which the country has been indebted to the labours of Sir F. Aprn and
Sir J. Dewar), the modified cordite known as M.D., and a tubular nitrocellulose
known as R. R. Rottweil.

The general results, which I need not say have necessitated much calculation, are
given in tables, but I think it necessary to give the results of a few experiments
worked out in full, these being a fair sample of the whole series. In each case I give
the reconciliation between the elements determined in the explosive and the same
elements found in the gases after explosion.

Taking into account the fact that the explosives themselves are not always of
precisely the same composition, and also the nature of the experiments, the recon-
ciliation to which I have referred is a very great deal closer than I expected.

It has been suggested to me more than once that the mixture of the gases might
not be homogeneous, that is, that tubes taken at different times from the explosion
vessel might not give the same analysis. I have not found this to be the case. Thus,
in an experiment where a charge of Rottweil R. R. was fired under a pressure of
20°5 tons per sq. inch (3125 atmospheres), and a tube of the resultant gases was
taken so soon as it was certain that all the air contained in the conducting tubes, &c.,
5 was displaced, a second tube being taken 6 or 7 minutes later, the analysis gave for
the two tubes of permanent gases the following percentages :—
