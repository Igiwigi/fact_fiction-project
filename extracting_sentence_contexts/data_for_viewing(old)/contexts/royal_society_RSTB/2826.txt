sporophyte do not give direct or consistent support to a theory of sterilisation. This,
together with the lateness of the spore-formation in the individual life, have obscured
the evolutionary history. Still in certain cases spore formation does appear early ;
interesting examples are seen in Lycopodium Selago, where sporangia may be formed

notes that sporangia are formed on all the leaves, even of the young plant.

The primitive sporophyte was probably of a radial type of construction, as are also
sporogonia, and microphyllous, with simple spore-bearing organs. The megaphyllous
state was probably of derivative origin. The more elaborate sporangial arrangements
arose by amplifications of simpler arrangements, by branching and repetition of them,
by placental upgrowths, and in more specialised cases by interpolation. On this view
the Leptosporangiate Ferns are the extreme examples of specialisation of the
megaphyllous habit, they show not only interpolation of new sporangia in the
sporophyte, but also as frequent characters those peculiar signs of instability which
are associated with apogamy and apospory ; these irregular developments are regarded
