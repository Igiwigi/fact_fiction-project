From
this it may be inferred that solenostely should not simply be regarded as an inevitable
expression of the specific reaction system (or specific hereditary substance) at a certain
stage in the individual development but that it should be referred to the action of
nutritional, mechanical and other factors, as well as genetic factors. Notwithstanding
the destructive effect of evidence such as that presented here on the findings of
comparative morphology, it still remains true that the details of vascular structure in the
pteridophytes do afford an important indication of affinity. In the present studies, due
attention must therefore be given to the fact that, notwithstanding the several unusual
vascular configurations produced as a result of the experimental treatment, there is eventually
a return to the typical dictyostelic condition of the normal shoot. Existing knowledge of
the differentiation of the vascular system in the ferns is still too inadequate to admit
of a harmonizing of the data of the causal and phyletic aspects. The presence of an actively developing bud in close proximity may play some part
in the medullation of a meristele.
