Accordingly in the diagram (fig. 9) each primordium is represented by a central circle,
of diameter equal to 0-45 of the total diameter, with marginal portions representing the
stipular rudiments attached to it on each side. At the time, indeed, when the position
of a primordium is being determined, it is still invisible, but the most probable assump-
tion is that its shape at that time is approximately the same as when it does become
visible. Moreover, primordia do not arise in positions which do not allow room for their

stipules, and this fact indicates that the areas from which the stipules are due to arise
must already form part of the physiological field of the primordium before it is visible.
