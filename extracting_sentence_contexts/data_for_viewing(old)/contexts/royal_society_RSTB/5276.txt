Thallophyta.
Funat.

Several specimens of Fungi were obtained from the layer of carbonised plant remains
in the cliffs of Skansen (Plate 4, fig. I’), and a selection was sent to Mr. J. RaMssorrom,
of the British Museum, who kindly supplied the following information:—‘ The slides
show a quantity of undoubted fruit-bodies and mycelium. ‘Though the reference of the
fruit-bodies to some definite genus is difficult, if not impossible, a most interesting fact
is that they appear to belong wholly to Asterina-like Fungi, and the mycelium which
occurs, often in considerable quantity, also belongs entirely, or nearly so, to such Fungi.
The fruit-bodies are for the most part characteristic, being flattened, radiate, disc-shaped
structures somewhat resembling in appearance the Green Alga Coleochete.”” These remains
afford interesting evidence of climatic conditions. Mr. Ramssorrom states that the
Asterinee are characteristic of intertropical regions: he points out that superficial
Fungi are more closely related to climatic conditions than are those which live within
the tissues of a host ; they are unable to absorb much water from the host, and by reason
of their exposed position they are extremely liable to desiccation and are able to develop
only in a very rainy climate.

Among other examples of fossil Asterinoid Fungi reference may be made to mycelia
