They are the
same bands as those seen in a solution of enterochlorophyll after treatment with
nitric acid. Nitric acid colours the solid pigment blue-green, which eventually
disappears, and is replaced by a red colour. Hence by saponifying ib is elear that
enterochlorophyll differs from plant chlorophyll with regard (1) to the difficulty of
separating its green from its yellow constituent ; (2) to the position of the bands in a
petroleum-ether extract of the yellow constituent; (3) in the fact that while this
yellow constituent gives a similar colour reaction with nitric and sulphuric acids, it
gives a different colour with iodine in iodide of potassium in most cages.

# A similar effect was noticed in the case of Ostrea, the golution becoming more orange after boiling
with NaHO. DR. OC.
