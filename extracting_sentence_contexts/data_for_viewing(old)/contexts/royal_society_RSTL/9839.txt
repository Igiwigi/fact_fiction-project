able, and this would lead to differences in the coefficients of tidal friction to which
there is no apparent means of approximating. It therefore seems inexpedient at,
present to devote time to the numerical solution of the problem of the rigid 8wn and
the tidally-disturbed planets.

$ 7. Numerical data and deductions therefrom.

Although we are thus brought to admit that it is difficult to construct any problem
which shall adequately represent the actual case, yeb a discnssion of certain numerical
values involved in the solar system and in the planetary s8ubsystems will, T think, lead
to some interesting results.

The fundamental fact with regard to the theory of tidal friction is the transforma-
tion of the rotational momentum of the planet as it is destroyed by tidal friction into
orbital momentum of the tide-raising body.

Hence we may derive information concerning the effects of tidal friction by the
evaluation of the various momenta of the several parts of the solar system.

Professor J. C. Apans has kindly given me a table of values of the planetary
masses, each with its attendant satellites. The authorities were as follows : for
Mercury, Excke; for Venus, LE VERRIER ; for the Earth, Hansex ; for Mars, Hair;
for Jupiter, Bgss8EL ; for Saturn, BessEL ; for Uranus, Vox AsTEN; for Neptune,
