charge that is collected at the contacts. The oligomers, including the compound C1290 is shown
in the inset, figure 4. Given the high order of symmetry of C¢9 molecules, the intermolecular
reaction sites are readily available to induce these chemical changes when sufficient energy is
supplied. However, oligomerization is far less likely when Ceo is replaced by the lower symmetry
C79 molecules as there are fewer sites that can be positioned adjacent to each other to allow for


such reactions to occur. Indeed, it is observed that OPVs based on C79 show a reduced tendency
for burn-in loss [11], contrary to the case of Cgo in figure 4a.

A simple method to reduce oligomerization and other energy-driven molecular degradation
pathways is to develop architectures that increase the exciton dissociation rate (and hence the
probability of defect formation during its lifetime) without also reducing cell performance. In fact,
bulk [14] and mixed heterojunction [15] cells have precisely this property: by placing a donor-
acceptor interface very near to the point of exciton generation, the exciton almost immediately
dissociates after light absorption, leaving it less time to engage in dissociative molecular
reactions. Indeed, for this same reason, such blended cells also have higher efficiencies—excitons
immediately dissociate into charge carriers prior to recombination. The charge carriers thus

generated are free to travel along contiguous domains of either the donor (in the case of : 8
holes) or acceptor (for electrons) molecules until they are collected at the appropriate device Dos
contacts. In a bulk heterojunction cell, the domains are typically formed by casting from solution, _
where partially miscible donor and acceptor molecular species phase segregate into a highly : Sy
interconnected network of nanometre-sized domains [14,16]. In the case of small molecules, 2
similar nanocrystalline domains form by co-deposition of appropriately matched donor and aed
