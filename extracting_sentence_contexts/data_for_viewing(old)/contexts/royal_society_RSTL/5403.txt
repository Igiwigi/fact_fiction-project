We have, therefore, = 1,

and we infer that the densities of saturated steam in reality bea1 the same propor-
tions to the densities assumed, according to the gaseous laws, as the numbers shown
for different temperatures in the preceding Table bear to 1390. Thus we see that
the assumed density must have been very nearly correct, about 30* Cent., but that
the true density increases much more at the high temperatures and pressures than
according to the gaseous laws, and consequently that steam appears to deviate from
BovrLe's law in the same direction as carbonic acid, but to a much greater amount,
which in fact it must do unless its coefficient of expansion is very much less, instead
of being, as it probably is, s0mewhat greater than for air. Also, we infer that the

Specific aye of steam at 100* Cent., instead of being only 7:5==> as was assumed,

or about 5; as it is generally supposed to be, must be as great as 5--- Without

using the preceding Table, we may determine the absolute density of saturated steam
by means of a formula obtained as follows. Since we have seen the true value of W
is nearly 1390, we must have, very approximately,
1390E
