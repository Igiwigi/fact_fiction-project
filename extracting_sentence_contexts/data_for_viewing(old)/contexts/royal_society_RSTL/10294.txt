Taking the exact coefficients in Table III. in the order in which they stand we have
first â€”

The constant deviation.
A.

Some rather large values of this coefficient are found in the tables, but it has been
proved that for standard compasses placed in the central fore and aft line of the vessel
where the iron is symmetrically placed with respect to that position, little or no real
value from magnetic causes has been observed. An error in the bearing of the distant
object used for swinging the ship, swinging her too fast, or prism error in the azimuth

cirele, gives fictitious values of this coefficient, which those in the table are considered
to be
