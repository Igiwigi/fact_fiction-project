should recall what von Mises said about these terms [68, p. 46]:

It is useful to introduce distinct names for the two probabilities of the same attribute,
the given probability in the initial collective and the calculated one in the new collective
formed by partition. The current expressions for these two probabilities are not very
satisfactory, although I cannot deny that they are impressive enough. The usual way is
to call the probability in the initial collective the a priori, and that in the derived collective
the a posteriori probability.

This usage exactly parallels von Neumannâ€™s. To continue:

The fact that these expressions suggest a connexion with a well-known philosophical
terminology is their first deficiency in my eyes. Another one is that these same expressions,
a priori and a posteriori, are used in the classical theory of probability in a different sense as
well, namely, to distinguish between probabilities derived from empirical data and those
assumed on the basis of some hypothesis; such a distinction is not pertinent in our theory.
I prefer, therefore, to give to the two probabilities less pretentious names, which have less
far-reaching and general associations. I will speak of initial probability and final probability,
meaning by the first term the probability in the original collective, and by the second one,
the probability (of the same attribute) in the collective derived by partition.

Von Neumann uses the more common terminology, but the meaning which MFQM vests in the
words is, by all evidence, the same as that which von Mises does. The result is not an argument
that probabilities should be seen as quantified fervencies of belief, but rather that a certain
