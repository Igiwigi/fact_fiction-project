2 which leaves 76,7344 for the length of the Paris toiſe in meaſures of the Royal So-
= ciety's braſs ſtandard, in the temperature of 61® of Fahrenheit's thermometer, - In the
S temperature of '62® it will'be alittle ſhorter 3 or it may be taken = 96,734 inches in
5 meaſures of the Royal Society's braſs ſtandard, This is, 2+..th'or about .d of an
Winch longer than was determined by Mr, Graham's experiment, Hence it appears,
© that I was miſtaken in ſuppoſing, in p. 325, that the. uncertainty about the true pro-
.& portion of the Engliſh and French meaſures was but ſmall, ſince the error in the for-
Z mer determination now appears to have been _.*__th_of the whole, or equivalent to
Z what, might have been produced, by a difference, of 84? of Fahrenheit's thermometer.
2Whence it aroſe I cannot pretend to ſay, neither is it very, material to enquire ; but the
S fact is, plain, and fully juſtifies the propriety of repeating the experiment.
S T ſhall now ſtate the length of the degree, meaſured; by Meſfieurs Maſon and Dixon,
fiſt in Engliſh feet, according to the Royal Society's ſtandard, and then reduced to
Zthe French meaſure by the proportion Guſt eſtabliſhed.
SZ Prom 363763 Engliſh feet, the length of the degree found by" the gow braſs
8ſtandard, ſee p. 324, I ſubtraCt 10 feet for the difference between Mr. Bird's ſcale
Sand the Royal Society's ſtandard, and 2 feet for the wearing of the braſs rod; and there
Eremain 363750 feet, according to the Royal Society's ſtandard, for the Tength"of the
degree, But to, this it ſeems proper to add 21 feet, in-order to corre& the poſition of
Sthe point C,: determined by the ſeQor, which cannot be ſo certain as that inferred from
Sthe azimuth of the line PS. See p. 299. | Therefore the true Jength of the degree, ,
according to the Royal Society's braſs ſtandard, in the temperature of 62% of Fabrenheits
Sehermometer, is 303771 ſeet, or 68,8960 Engliſh ſtatute miles. | To reduce: this to the
