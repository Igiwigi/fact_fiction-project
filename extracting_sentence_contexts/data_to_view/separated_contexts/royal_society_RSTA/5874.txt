3. Proof of threshold theorem

From equations (2.6) and (2.7), the time evolution of the expectation of the state is described as

4 |
ig Ello) = (Aw -5 0) ELI6())], (3.1)
k


where we used E[dW;(t)] =0 in the Ito process. Then, using the fact that |y(T)) is the solution of
equation (2.1), we find

olti2)10 Nasi M ELI g(T))] = (D)). (3.2)

We describe the state in one realized time trajectory of equation (2.6) as |;(t)) and expand it at the
final time T as

\;(T)) = > Cinln). (3.3)
n
From equation (3.2), we immediately find

ell) Lage VC] =Cn=1-e. (3.4)

Then, using the Chernoff—Hoeffding inequality [27,28], we have

r —4§2
Pr [enmtzacinat > RCim —(1—-€)< -s| <exp ( e ) , (3.5)
i=1

where Cj, = RC) + i3Cjm, 5 > 0, and we used —1 < RC; <1. In the following, we set 0 <6 <
1 —€ and always consider the case in which

rt
ell ExSH04 2 SHC jy > 1 = 8. (3.6)
r i=1
We note that this inequality plays an important role as a constraint and holds with probability
greater than 1 — exp(—r6?/2) from equation (3.5). Next, we consider the case in which the probability amplitudes of the target state in the r
realized time trajectories of equation (2.6) satisfy

In the following, we prove that, under the conditions (2.9) and (3.6), equation (3.7) holds.
