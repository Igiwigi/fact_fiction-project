5-192; Among the regularities in the atomic heat of solid bodies, that found by DuLoxG
and Pe7IT for the elements stands foremost. A glance at the atomic heats of the 80-
called elements collated in { 82, shows that for by far the greater number the atomic
heats are in fact approximately equal. But the differences in the atomic heats, even of
those elements which are usually regarded as coming under DULoxXG and PeviT's law,
are often very considerable, even when the comparison is limited to those which are
most easily obtained in a pure state, and even if numbers are taken for the specific heats
which give the most closely agreeing atomic heats. ReGxAuLT * sought an explanation
of the differences of the atomic heats of the elements in the circumstance that the latter
could not be investigated in comparable conditions of temperature and density ; further,
that the numbers for the specific heat, as determined for solid bodies, contain, beetles
