same rise of temperature, from 11° to 18°, in the calorimeter. The discrepancies of
individual measurements at any one point do not exceed ‘3 per cent., but he did not
vary the conditions of experiment materially, and it may be questioned whether the
well-known constant errors of the method could have been eliminated by the devices
which he adopted. His results (see Table XIV., p. 144) give a minimum at 25° and
a maximum at 87° C., the values being *9935 and 1:0075 respectively, in terms of
the mean specific heat between 0° and 100°. The rapid rise from 25° to 75° may
possibly have been due to radiation error from the hot water supply; and the
subsequent fall between 90° and 100° to the inevitable loss of heat by evaporation of
the nearly boiling water on its way to the calorimeter. His values, reduced to a unit
at 20° C., are given for comparison in Table XIV. The agreement with our values is
remarkably close at the lower temperatures ; but the difference at 80° amounts to
nearly 1 per cent. In addition to the fact that his curve cannot easily be reconciled
with Rrenavtr, there is this theoretical difficulty in accepting his values at higher
temperatures. The quantity which he actually observed was the mean specific heat
between the higher temperature and the final temperature of his calorimeter. His
values of the specific heat itself were obtained by differentiating the curve, and really
depend on small differences at the higher points between observations which are
themselves difficult and uncertain. His values for the mean specific heat differ much
less from ours. The peculiar advantage of the method we adopted is that the specific
heat itself is determined over a range of 8° to 10° at each point by adding accurately
measured quantities of energy to the water at the desired temperature. There is no
possibility of evaporation or heat-loss in transference as in the method of mixture, and
the protection from external radiation is much more perfect.
