Conclusion and perspectives

— Faults are subject to thermal weakening and consequent shear localization processes,
which may involve:
(1) thermal pressurization
(i) of native ground fluid (e.g. H2O)
(ii) of volatiles (e.g. HzO or CO2) as fault core decomposition products;

(2) flash heating at asperity contacts;
(3) melting, the ultimate weakening process, not very fully discussed here but
evidenced by thin pseudotachylite layers along some exhumed faults.

— Static fault strength Tstatic=fstaticon May be an unreliable predictor of pre-earthquake : =
stress on major, well-slipped, smooth faults. : =
— Such faults may operate near or slightly above Tpulse (a t level at which a small event, 1B
once nucleated, propagates for indefinitely large distance). : =
— Roughness may keep less mature faults from the full consequences of dynamic Da
weakening; to slip them, the fault sidewalls must be deformed. : re
— The fact that a segment is creeping may not preclude it from having large coseismic slip al
through stress pulses that are sufficient to activate a dynamic weakening mechanism 1
