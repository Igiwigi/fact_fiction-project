of the vitelline vein within the liver, but expressly says that it is not the homologue of
that of Mammals.*

The term ductus venosus Arantii has always been applied to the definitive relations
of the vessel irrespective of its mode of origin. As a matter of fact, both ductus venosus
and ductus venosus Arantii vary so considerably in their origin that it is impossible to
give an ontological definition of either. All one can say is that the ductus venosus
Arantii is the common channel through which blood from the vitelline and allantoic veins
enters the postcaval, whilst the ductus venosus is that channel through which the blood
from the vitelline vein alone enters the postcaval. As concerns their origin, the channel may be simply derived from the cranial anasto-
mosis between the vitelline veins, of which it is a persistent portion (Trichosurus,
Chick and probably also Dasyurus), or slightly more complicated in origin when it
arises as a secondary vessel formed by the flowing together of the hepatic sinusoids,
these being derived from the cranial anastomosis (Perameles, Phascolarctus, Didelphys,
Man) (INGALLS, 07, and His, ’85), where, according to the latter it arises as well from
twigs radiating out from under the sinus venosus (text-figs. 24 (A) and (B) and 22 (r)).
