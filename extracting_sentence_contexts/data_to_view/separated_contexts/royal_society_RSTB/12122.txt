In complex environmental samples it
these components, analogous to what we would obtain would be necessary to discriminate eukaryotic cells
from a metatranscriptomic analysis but with single-cell from non-cellular particles and non-eukaryotes. Cell
resolution; (iii) life cycle stages or temporal cell types for selection through FACS can solve this issue by target-
each of the members of the community; and (iv) microbial ing only cells of interest. FACS additionally allows the
interactions and their associated transcriptional pheno- strict selection of only single cells, which may contain
types. Many of the predictions of these analyses could be within them endosymbionts, prey, parasites and/or
validated by using multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybrid- pathogens. This is another major advantage when
