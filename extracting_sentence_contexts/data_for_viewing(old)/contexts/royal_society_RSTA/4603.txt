identified for the lack of craters on the Earth: (i) the geologically active nature of our planet 2 |
(exogene and endogene dynamics) and the constant recycling of oceanic crust by subduction, (ii)

the atmosphere, which is capable of deflecting small bodies, and (iii) the fact that about two-thirds “3
of the Earth’s surface is covered by water. For the last point, direct evidence of impacts, such as : a
crater structures [1-5] or indicative high-pressure modifications in rocks and mineral phases [6,7] ig
on the ocean floor, can only be found if an impactor is large enough to penetrate through the water : s

column [7-9]. The exact diameter that a meteorite has to have to leave behind physical evidence
on the seafloor is being discussed in the literature, but estimates from numerical modelling (e.g.
[3,10]) and experimental work [1,5] indicate that the diameter has to be at least 10-15% of the
water depth, assuming a rocky composition and an average impact velocity of 18 kms™! ([9] and

references therein). From these rough estimates, it can be concluded that bodies smaller than : &
approximately 500 m falling into an ocean with a typical water depth of 3.5-4km do not leave Dos
any trace behind. As an example for a threshold case, the Eltanin impact in the Bellinghausen Sea : =
