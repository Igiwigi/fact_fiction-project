The strong anisotropy of the nitrates and carbonates receives a natural explanation
in terms of the intrinsic anisotropy of the NO,~ and CO,~~ ions and the parallel orienta-
tions of all the ions in the crystal. (The contribution to the susceptibility of the crystal
from the metallic ions is presumably isotropic.) The fact that ~, — y, has the same
value for both the nitrates and nearly the same value for the four carbonates is then
readily understood. Indeed, it is possible, as has been shown in a recent paper,* to
calculate the actual magnetic anisotropy of the NO,~ion from the Cotton-Mouton
constant of nitric acid (or of aqueous solutions of nitrates) and this value is found to be
in satisfactory agreement with the observed value of x; — y for the crystal. Why the nitrate and the carbonate ions are so strongly anisotropic is difficult to
understand.
