If the immune response
is non-specific, it may cross-react with other co-infecting para-
site strains or species [2]. This immune-system mediated
competition thereby favours pathogens that can escape the
immune response by hiding from or being immune to its
effects. In fact, the ability to withstand a severe inflammatory
host response can favour the emergence of a parasite that pro-
vokes the immune response and subsequently benefits from
the clearing of less resistant competitors (figure 1e) [21]. How do the complex competitive interactions within the
host balance with among-host selection? Empirical work has
demonstrated that each of the mechanisms described above
can alter parasite within-host reproduction and transmission
success.
