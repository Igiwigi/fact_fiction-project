This is
in stark contrast to uncorrelatedness, which means that (6.1) holds for the identity function
fils) =f2(s) =s. This equation suggests that to find a transformation that is guaranteed to give
independent components, we need an infinite number of parameters, i.e. a class of rather
arbitrary nonlinear transformations. It is thus not surprising that linear transforms cannot achieve
independence in the general case, i.e. for data with an arbitrary distribution. (See Hyvarinen et al.
[38, ch. 9] for more discussion.)

In fact, if we consider a real dataset, it seems quite idealistic to assume that it could be a linear
superposition of strictly independent components. A more realistic attitude is to assume that
the components are bound to have some dependencies. Then, the central question is whether
independence is a useful assumption for a particular dataset in the sense that it allows for
estimation of meaningful components.
