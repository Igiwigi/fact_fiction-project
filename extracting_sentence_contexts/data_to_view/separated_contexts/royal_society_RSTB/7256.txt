When the centre of this
curve was fixed by the observer, who, as before, used a correcting lens and an artificial
pupil, he noticed that the part near the fixation mark had a normal appearance but that
the ends seemed to wriggle as if they were living flagellae. The use of a red, green or blue
filter did not seem to alter the appearance materially. The explanation of this effect which
most closely fits the facts is that at the centre of fixation, where there is a cluster, small

fortuitous eye movements do not materially affect the appearance of the curve since its
image only moves off one set of cones to fall on another set substantially like them. The ends
of the curve, on the other hand, fall outside this cluster, on parts of the retina where the
cone population, responding to the particular coloured light in use, is relatively sparse.
