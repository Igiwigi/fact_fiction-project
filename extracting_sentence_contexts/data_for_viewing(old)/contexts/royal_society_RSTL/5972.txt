Felations of the segmental organs of the Annelids assumes a character of unusual im-
Jortance. A few detached conjectures upon this subject some years ago were thrown
Sut by LEYDIG:—* Das © arabeskenformige Organ” der Nephelis und das * rosettenformige
Vimperorgan' der Clepsine, worauf auch bereits Gegenbauer angespielt hat, nichts
:Syeiteres sind, als die Endstiicke der Respirationskanile dieser Hirudineen. Von gleicher
edeutung halte ich die eigenthiimlichen * pantoffel- und fullhornformigen Organe* der
ynapta digitata, welche Jon. MULLER (Archiv fiir Anat. u. Physiol. 1852), aufgefunden
a deren feine Cilien ebenfalls nach einwiirts schlagen *.”
In a very recent paper * iiber Hydatina Sentaf,” LeypiG speaks of the ciliated tubes
5. * Respirationsorgane.”
FB From these passages it is evident that this comparison between the ciliated organs of
Wlepsina and Nephelis and those of Synapta digitata, was suggested to the mind of
T nvypIG simply by the fact, that in each instance the organ terminated internally by an
Sxpanded ciliated umbrella-like extremity. His comparison ends where this arbitrary
Yund unimportant point of resemblance ceases. He originates no morphological principle.
b” resxemblance which he suggests is a mere accidental observation.
The author will now proceed to develope the views, with the importance of which he
Ag deeply impressed, which he has been inductively led to adopt from a clear and con-
vincing recognition of an essential unity of desiqn in the structure and uses of the
8egmental system of organs throughout the classes to which his observations relate. 'The
subject may be conveniently distributed under the following arrangement of heads :—
