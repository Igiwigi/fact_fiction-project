4. Summary and conclusion 3

Figures 2-4 illustrate the particle-size distribution function plotted in accordance with the [8
analytical solution (3.15) (physical parameters of the system under consideration are given in :
[15], Q(t) = A(1 — sin(wt)/2), A = 0.005, and w = 7/15). The first important conclusion is the fact
that the size distribution of crystals strongly depends on the parameter x (compare curves at
different x in figures 2 and 3a,b). It is easily seen that the nonlinear growth rate of particles
in a metastable liquid of crystallizer (expressions (1.1)) substantially changes the particle-size
distribution. Our calculations show that the relative error may exceed tens of per cent in the course
of time for real metastable liquids.
