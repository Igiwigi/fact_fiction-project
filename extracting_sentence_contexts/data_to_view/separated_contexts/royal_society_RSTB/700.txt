DR. A. HILL ON THE CEREBRUM OF ORNITHORHYNCHUS PARADOXUS. 375

Is the dentary fissure a true fissure? The fact that the same terminology is used
in this as in other parts of the brain has led, as I think, to fruitless attempts to
homologize the several structures which make up the “hippocampus” with other
. of the pallium. The hippocampus is altogether different in constitution from
the rest of the pallium, and forms, as was recognized by Broca and by ZucKER-
 KANDL, a part of the rhinencephalon.
