nical instability, or to any self-acting currents of air, and T was in some degree satisfied
with it. But it is equally inconsistent with the second law of thermodynamics. In fact,
if the temperature of any substance, when in thermic equilibrium, is a function of the
height, that of any other substance must be the same function of the height. For if not,
let equal columns of the two substances be enclosed in cylinders impermeable to heat,
and put in thermal communication at the bottom. If, when in thermal equilibrium, the
tops of the two columns are at different temperatures, an engine might be worked by
taking heat from the hotter and giving it up to the cooler, and the refuse heat would
circulate round the system till it was all converted into mechanical energy, which is in
A contradiction to the second law of thermodynamics.
