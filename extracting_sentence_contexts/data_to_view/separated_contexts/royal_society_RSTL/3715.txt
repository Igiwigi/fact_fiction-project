Such of the Invertebrata, also,
as happened to be easily obtainable, were examined, and afforded ample confirmation

like the beads of a necklace, in a line; and then, by the disappearance of the inter-
vening septa, forming a tube, the foundation of the fibres of the Crystalline Lens||.

61. I bave now to state, that within this tube there are formed, in the first place
dises (fig. 129), and then filaments (fig. 130 Â«), having precisely the same structure
as the filaments of other parts.
