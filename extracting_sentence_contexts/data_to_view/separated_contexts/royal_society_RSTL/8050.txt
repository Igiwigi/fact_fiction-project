'The Isogonics present a precisely similar coincidence, as might be
expected from their position in relation to the pole's actual path. Since, moreover, p p is more nearly parallel with the Isogonics than with the Isoclinals
and Isedynamics, there is a greater fixity in the mean angle for the whole of France in
the case of the former lines than in that of the latter. Lastly, the Isoclinals and Isodynamics are spreading out more quickly in the west
than in the east, and there exists at present very little difference in the thickness of
these lines in the two portions of the country, both of which conclusions would natu-
rally follow from the fact that the pole is becoming more and more nearly equidistant
from the east and west of France. The exceptional case of the Isogonics, which are
spreading out in the east and drawing closer in the west, evidently arises mainly from
inaccuracy of observation. A general Table may now be formed of all the magnetic elements, reduced to the
epoch Jan. 1, 1869, for the stations in the east of France.
