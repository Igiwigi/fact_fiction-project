S It will subsequently be expressed in terms of the function D(z) introduced into the
& theory of the functions G (z|7) (‘ Genesis of the Double Gamma Function,” § 4).
It will be seen later that the algebra of the double gamma function would have
& been slightly simplified had a modified value been taken for this function y,(,, «s),
3 and the analogue shortly to be considered, y2,(w,, @,). I did not observe this fact
3 until the theory had been completely developed, and the matter is scarcely of suffi-
cient importance to demand the labour which such a change would entail.
A Corollary.—N otice that it has been proved incidentally that
