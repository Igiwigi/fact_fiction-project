The number of flows usually taken in a complete experiment was two, but some-
times three. Other flows were tried to test the theory of the method beyond the
limits of flow chosen for the actual experiments. In all the flows two intervals ot
15 minutes were taken, which, when worked out, gave a complete check on the
steadiness of the conditions and the accuracy of the observations.

None of these measurements depend very much on the absolute readings of mercury
thermometers except the Clark cell. The temperature of the standard-resistance was
always taken with the thermometer used in its calibration with the standard ohm,
which in turn had such a small temperature coefficient that it made it of very little
importance whether the thermometer used to obtain its temperature was in error by
as much as ‘5°. As a matter of fact, by direct comparison, all the thermometers used
agreed with our standard thermometer to within ‘1°. The thermometer used to
obtain the temperature of the jacket-water between 0° and 50° C., was a new Miiller

graduated to ‘1° and reading to z}oths. Its error was determined by comparison
with the standard thermometer, and its readings were found to be ‘03° too large. The
standard thermometer was a Geissler reading to zooth between — 2° and 50° C.,
which has been in the possession of the laboratory for several years, as before stated.
