The
conductor is de facto the driving force behind the pattern of
group information flow, at multiple levels. The conductor is
not merely giving tempo to the players or the timing of attacks
during public performances. In fact, the conductor is also
selecting musicians, leading rehearsals, as well as deciding
fine interpretation details of the pieces, based on personal
taste and a philological erudition [76]. At the highest levels,
the conductor is the major driver in fine-tuning all aspects of
the performance [77]. The sensorimotor conversation between
musicians and conductors is certainly important for musical
performance.
