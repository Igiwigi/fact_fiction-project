be the very same with the original point, and it is therefore clear that a consecutive
point may be represented in the same manner with magnitudes, however large, of X, Y,...
But we may assume them indefinitely small, that-is, the ratios a +dw : y+dy, : . ., where
>z, By, . . . are indefinitely small in regard to (&, y, . . .), will represent any set of ratios
indefinitely near to the ratios (@ : y, . . .).

The foregoing quantities (>z, 3y, . . .) are termed the increments.

66. Consider a k-fold relation between the m+1T coordinates (, y, ...), &  m; the
increments (3, 3y, . . .) are connected by a linear -fold relation.

The linear /-fold relation is satisfied if we assume the increments proportional to the
coordinates—this is, in fact, assuming that the point remains unaltered, We may write
(3x, dy, . . .)=(x, y, - - -), 8ince in such an equation only the ratios are attended to. But it
may be preferable to write (3z, 3y, . ..)=a(&, y,. . .). Tn particular if k=m, then the
increments are connected by a linear m-fold relation; that is, the ratio of the increments
is uniquely determined; and as the relation is satisfied by taking the increments propor-
tional to the coordinates, it is clear that the yalues which the linear m-fold relation gives
for the increments are in fact proportional to the coordinates: viz. there is not in this
case any consecutive point.

67. Considering the þ-fold relation as belonging to a &-fold locus in the m-space, 80
that (, y, .. .)'are the coordinates of a point on this locus, then if in the linear k-fold
relation between the increments these increments are replaced by the coordinates (x, y, . . .)
of a point in the 1-space, then considering the original coordinates (a, y, - - -) as para-
