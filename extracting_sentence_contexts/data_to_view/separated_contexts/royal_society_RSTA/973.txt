Although this difference in conductivity between the porous and dense phase is
consistent with the need for closely packed hopping sites, the activation energies of the two
phases were identical, 0.25eV. The phase-independent activation energy data may point to
dominating surface conduction pathways as proposed by the authors. However, the distinct
differences in conductivity as a function of phase density and the fact that the identities of
the hopping sites do remain constant in both phases highlights the importance of hopping site
density on ionic conductivity. Most tellingly, it emphasizes that three-dimensionally connected
pores become detrimental to ion transport beyond a certain diameter. Another example of anionic borates being featured in ionically conductive MOFs and COFs
was a spiroborate-based COF synthesized by base-promoted transesterification of diols and
trimethylborate using LiOH as the base.
