The error in measuring the conductivity
might be 0°5 per cent., and the error in measuring the small amount of current
flowing through the apparatus also about 0°5 per cent. The error in the calibration
of the tube is negligible, and, therefore, in a good experiment the transport number
should be correct to about 1 part in 300, and the ionic velocities to at least 1 part
in 100. As a matter of fact, this degree of accuracy is easily attainable for the
transport number. In the case of the separate ionic velocities the accuracy obtainable
is not quite so great owing to the accumulation of errors from the various measure-
ments involved,
