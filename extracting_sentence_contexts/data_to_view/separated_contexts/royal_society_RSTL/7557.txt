I stop to further explain these notions of the line-pair and the point-pair; and
also the notion of the line-pair-point. A conic is a curve of the second order and second class ; gua curve of the second
order it may degenerate into a pair of lines, or line-pair (but the class is then=0) : que
curve of the second class it may degenerate into a pair of points, or point-pair (but the
order is then=0). The two lines of a line-pair may be coincident, and we have then a
coincident line-pair; such a line-pair (it must T think be postulated) ordinarily arises,
not from a line-pair the two lines of which become coincident, but from a proper conic,
flattening by the gradual diminution of its conjugate axis, while its transyerse axis
remains constant, or approaches a limit different from zero ; the conic thus tends (not to
an indefinitely extended but) to a terminated line* ; in other words, the tangents of the
conic become more and more nearly lines through two fixed points, the terminations of
the terminated line; and these terminating points, which continue to exist up to the
instant when the conjugate axis takes its limiting value=0, are regarded as still existing
at this instant, and the coincident line-pair as being in fact the point-pair formed by the
two terminating points. Similarly the two points of a point-pair may be coincident,
and we have then a coincident point-pair; such a point-pair (it must in like manner be
postulated) ordinarily arises, not from a point-pair the two points of which become coin-
cident, but from a proper conic sharpening itself to coincide with its asymptotes, and 80
becoming ultimately a pair of lines through the coincident point-pair ; and the coincident
point-pair is regarded as being in fact the line-pair formed by some two lines through the

coincident point-pair. 31.
