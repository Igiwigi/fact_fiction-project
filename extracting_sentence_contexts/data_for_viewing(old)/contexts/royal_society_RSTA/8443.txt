number of lines in these spectra.

Secondly, one is not, as a rule, able to search for a frequency difference constantly
repeated within at most one unit of wave-number, for, owing to the shortness of the
wave-leneths concerned and the inevitably somewhat large errors of measurement, one
rarely can expect a measured separation to be within ten or twenty units of its true
value. Thus, while it is not difficult to find many pairs with the same separation within
these limits, they are only too likely to be fortuitous. This is not to say that such a
clue is useless, but only that it must be received with caution and considered in relation
to other evidence. By way of illustration, let us consider a pair of lines at 21200 A
and 4 1600 A, the error in measurement being certainly < 0-1 A in each. This means
that the wave-numbers are 83,333 + 7 and 62,500 + 4—i.c., the separation may be in
error by + 11 units owing to the fact that an error d? produces an error dy = d/?°.
Thus the values of a doublet separation between two pairs of lines accurate to 0-1 A
may differ by + 20 units.

The richness in lines of these spectra is another source of difficulty, The spectra
are not pure or even easily separable into their constituents as are ordinary are or
spark spectra, but contain lines due to the un-ionised element (though to a negligible
extent) and lines due to the element in the first, second, third, fourth, and even higher
stages of ionisation.

Since the series are not extended far enough, we are not able to use formule of the
Rydberg type for the calculation of limits or terms, and to check our results; nor is
there an opportunity to avail ourselves of combination lines, since these, while they
