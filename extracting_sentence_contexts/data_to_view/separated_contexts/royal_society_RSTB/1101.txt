conditions which are dependent upon continuity with the cord are
maintained by any facilities which the preservation of vessels affords for keeping up a
circulation in the nerve, since this must be, undoubtedly, greatly impaired by the
exposure. The conditions of vitality would rather seem to be linked with the
maintenance of physiological connection with other nerve structures, around which
an active circulation is still being carried on, and which, therefore, retain their normal
vital characteristics. That this is probable is shown by the fact that when, as some-
times occurs, the nerve difference, owing to rapid drying, shows a steady rise in
amount, which rise continues even when no evidence of circulation in the exposed
nerve is obvious, the rise is immediately counterbalanced and converted into a fall on
systemic death of the animal, this fall occurring pari passu with the loss of excita-
bility in the central nerve structures. ‘

(c.) Physiological Changes Connected with Haxcitation.—The alterations due to
excitation were after effects, that is, they followed the development of the transient
excitatory change and consisted in a permanent slight diminution in the previously
existing difference, such as has been observed to follow nerve excitation in the case of
the Frog. The slow after effect can be readily distinguished from the transient rapid electrical
changes due to the actual presence of excitatory processes evoked by the application
of the stimulus, since these are synehronous with the excitation, whereas the after-
effect is very variable in its duration, but always follows cessation of the stimulus, and
persists for many seconds.
