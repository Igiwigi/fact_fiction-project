The expressions
reported in reference [40] for the Py line-strength factors are incompatible with the concomitance
of linearly polarized light and AJ =0 transitions. For a two-photon dipole transition from an
initial i state to a final f state, the virtual states accessed by the first photon are not unique
and the intensity must be calculated taking into account all possible paths with different
magnetic quantum numbers. As Mo and Suzuki showed, however, the fact that the relative ratios
between the geometrical factors in two-photon transitions are invariant to the character of the
virtual states, simplifies considerably the problem and, therefore, the intricate expression for the
Px, Ji) developed by Zare and co-workers (KSZ) [43]. In the early years of the photofragment
polarization analysis, KSZ had already underlined that the radial integrals of the transition dipole
moments (between the initial and virtual states, and between the virtual and final states), which
are unknown, can be usually included in the detection constant [43]. The exception to KSZâ€™s

and Mo and Suzuki's studies are the AJ=0 transitions excited with linearly polarized light. : =
In those cases, the branching ratio between the different intermediate states of the two-photon : S
processes must be known.
