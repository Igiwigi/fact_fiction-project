A vortex sheet is the free boundary between two fluids shearing past each
other in irrotational flow, the vorticity being measure-valued and supported on
the free boundary between the fluids. Linearizing the equation of motion of the
vortex sheet one obtains that the motion is linearly stable if surface tension acts,
while linear instability holds if the effects of surface tension are neglectedâ€”an
effect known as the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (Saffman 1995). The paper by
Ambrose (2007) presents a proof of the fact that surface tension regularizes the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability for the full nonlinear equations. Several papers of this issue are devoted to qualitative studies of two recently
derived integrable nonlinear models for the propagation of shallow water waves:
the CH equation (Camassa & Holm 1993; Johnson 2002) and the DP equation
(Degasperis & Procesi 1999). Both nonlinear PDEs share with the classical KdV
model the properties that they have a bi-Hamiltonian structure and are formally
integrable? (Fokas & Fuchssteiner 1981; Camassa & Holm 1993; Degasperis &
Procesi 1999).
