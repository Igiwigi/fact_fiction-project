The pieces of amorphous sugar used for these experiments were clear even when the
experiments were concluded. In the investigation of snch a hygroscopie substance it is
impossible to avoid with certainty any absorption of water ; yet it seems to me improbable
that, the difference between the number 0-342 found for amorphous cane-sugar between
20* and 51”, and 0-301 for crystallized sugar between the same limits, depends on an
absorption of water by the former ; but it is probable that the greater specific heat
found for amorphous sugar depends on the fact that at 50* eyen it contains some heat
of 8oftening. According to WonrLER's observations, bodies in the amorphous condi-
tion have other, in genera] lower, fusing-points than those in the crystallized statef ;
crystallized cane-sugar melts at 160* C., amorphous between 90* and 100*; at the latter
temperature the amorphous sugar may be drawn out, in threads, but even at a lower tem-
perature the softening begins.

Mannite, Cz H,, Og, Crystallized mannite, dried at 100*, was melted in the oil-bath
at 160*-170*, and the radiant crystalline mass was comminuted. It gave the following
rexults þ.
