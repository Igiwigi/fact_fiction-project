a period of nearly five decades and is now sufficiently highly developed that
it can be used in the pharmaceutical industry to clarify the actions of drugs
(Noble 20088).

Does not the fact that we can succeed in doing this prove that, after all,
there are genetic programs? Well no, for two reasons. First the logic represented
by such computer simulation programs is certainly not to be found simply in
the DNA sequences. The programs are representations of the processes involved
at all the relevant biological levels, right up to and including the intricate
architecture of the cell itself. And when even higher levels are modelled, the
structural biology included is that of tissues or the entire organ (Hunter et al.
2003; Garny et al. 2005). In the case of the heart, the three-dimensional imaging
technology to achieve this has now advanced to paracellular or even subcellular
levels (Plank et al. 2009).

Second, reflecting Coenâ€™s point above, the processes represented in our
modelling programs are the functionality itself. To the extent that the program
