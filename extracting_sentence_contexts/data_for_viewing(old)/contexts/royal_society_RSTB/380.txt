construction in this place. The bottoms of two flat wooden trays were, in each case,
covered with black and gilt paper, the different colours meeting along a line which
ran across the tray, and along which a shelf was fixed covered with gilt paper
towards the gilt side of the tray, and black towards the black side. The shelves close
to the tray bottom were perforated with holes separated by equal distances, and the
size of each hole was such as to easily admit the body of a larva, with its spines, but
sufficiently small to prevent the occurrence of any considerable space between the edge
of the aperture and the larval body. In fact, such space as existed was much obscured
by the larval spines. The trays were placed vertically, with the coloured surfaces
facing a strong east light, and close to the window, so that the shelves projected
horizontally ; but the black surface was uppermost in one tray, and the gilt surface in
the other.
Whenever suspended larvae were found among the food-plant, &c., of the cylinder
containing the stock they were pinned on to the part of the trays covered with the
upper colour, in such a position over the holes that the head and thoracic segments,
and generally the first and second abdominal segments, of each larva passed through a
hole into the colour beneath, which tended to produce opposite results. This anterior
part of the body being always strongly curved in Stage III, the head with any
sensory organs upon it was brought close up to the under-side of the shelf, and thus
there was no chance of its being influenced in any way by the colour above the shelf
