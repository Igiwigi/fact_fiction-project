This is where time-reversal strongly differs from its monochromatic ancestor,
namely, phase conjugation [25]. This very simple yet fascinating experiment is easier to understand considering another
experiment conducted with elastic waves propagating inside a two-dimensional solid cavity as
described in the set-up of figure 3 taken from [31]. An aluminium cone coupled with a transducer
generates surface waves (in fact flexural waves) at one point ro of a non-symmetrical and ergodic
silicon cavity. A second transducer is used as a receiver. The central frequency fo of the transducers
is set to 1 MHz and their relative bandwidth to 100% (Af = 1MHz).
