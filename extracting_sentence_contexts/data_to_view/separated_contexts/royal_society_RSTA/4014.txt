This means that a magnetic field of 1.8T does
not fully induce the transformation in those samples. We can observe in table 4 that there is
no close relationship between the ASpeak and the As¢y) values: for instance, S4 has the biggest
Asfuy = 14J kg! kK among the four samples but it shows a ASpeak lower than that of S2. This
fact underlines that further quantities characterizing the transitions play a role in determining the
As(T) and AT,4(T) of real materials. A large As¢y, which on the basis of the Clausius—Clapeyron
relation is proportional to the magnetization difference between the two phases, is not enough to
ensure a large ASpeak exploitable in thermomagnetic cycles. There is instead a correlation between
ATadpeak and (dT/\19dH); however also in this case none of the samples reaches the maximum
expected value of ATaq, calculated as AH - (dT/dH) (table 4).
