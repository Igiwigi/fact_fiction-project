And it may similarly be shown that

aet((P,Q)—det (P'Q)=det {(P)=(P'), Q}-7 0h nh nn nn 1 (LE) The same proposition follows also easily from a consideration of the linear expressions
(11.) in section 24 for the projections of a determinant, and is in fact equivalent to a
fundamental theorem concerning algebraic determinants, which theorem may be found
in Sa1Mox's © Lessons on Higher Algebra,” section 19, page 9.

27. The proposition proved in the last section will be found to be of constant use in
explaining and shortening analytical processes in mechanics. One useful application can
be made of it in proving © the parallelogram of angular velocities.”
