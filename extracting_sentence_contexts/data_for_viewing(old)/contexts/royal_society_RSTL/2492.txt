oxygen possesses the same property, but in a higher degree, I ascertained in the
island of St. Thomas in 1827. TI afterwards made experiments on a larger scale, in
1830, at the high rock of Saratoga, where there is an atmosphere of natural carbonic
acid; and the result was communicated to many physicians in America previously
to any of the American publications on the snbject.

It is now more than probable that the changes which Lavors1ts believed to occur

'in the lungs take place in reality inthe extreme circulation. Some later writers
have assnmed that the elements of carbonic acid exist in the blood, and that its for-
mation commenced in the large vessels as they leave the left side of the heart, and
was not finally completed until the blood arrives in the right auricle. But that this
opinion is erroneous, is evident from the fact, that the blood eyen in the smallest
arteries is as completely arterial as that in the left side of the heart, whilst the blood
in the 8mallest veins is equally venous. ,

There is in the capillary system, oyer the whole body, an intermediate structure
which connects the arterial with the venous circulation, and it is in this structure
that the blood is changed from arterial. to venous. When the arterial blood leaves
the minute arteries, it is no longer confined in actual vessels, but in cells that are
formed by the surrounding tissue. When this cellular structure is examined in
living animals, with the assistance of a good microscope, minute globules are seen to
leave the cells and penetrate the surrounding solids, whilst other globules are seen
to return and mix with the blood in the cells. Now as we know that it is in these
cells that the blood becomes dark and venous, from the addition of carbonic acid,
