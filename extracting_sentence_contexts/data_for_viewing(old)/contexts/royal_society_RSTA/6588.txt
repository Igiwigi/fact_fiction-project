That is to say, over the interior of Northern and Central India the upper currents in
this month have exactly the same direction as the anomalous hot winds which we have
reason to suppose may be caused by their descent under the convective action set up
by the daily passage of the sun.

The steepest gradient on the map is that to the west of the Orissa coast. Distur-
bances originating at the head of the Bay would therefore, according to the usu
experience that the line of least resistance is that of lowest pressure, experience much
difficulty in proceeding westwards, but would meet with less resistance in the north
ward direction over Bengal. As a matter of fact, the majority of such storms as are
formed in this region during May do proceed northwards,* and those which turn
westwards across the plain of Orissa do not survive to reach the Central Provinces.
Mr. Extor attributes their rapid break-up to the comparatively small height to which
they extend in the atmosphere, and the resistance they experience from the hills west
of Orissa; but, while this may be one reason for their disappearance, the rapidly
increasing pressure in a westward direction at moderately great elevations is doubtless’
another,

The low-pressure area extending obliquely across Bengal and Assam is the scene of
frequent local storms, known as “ Nor’-Westers,” in the hot season, and the area of
maximum “spring storm rainfall” on Mr. BLanrorp’s chartst coincides very closely
with it. At page 105 of the work cited, Mr. Buanrorp gives a clear and interesting
