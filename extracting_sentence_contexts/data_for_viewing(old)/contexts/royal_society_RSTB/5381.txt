injection of the posterior cerebral artery. It is from Sroprorp’s work, however, that
we have the most striking examples of precision in arterial supply (1915). He found that
“invariably the trigonum hypoglossi was accurately defined by the stain of the injec-
tion’ from the anterior spinal artery; that, after injection of the vertebral artery,
“the injection always demarcated the trigonum vagi’’; and that, after injection of
the posterior spinal artery, the ‘‘ descending ramus supplied the funiculi gracilis and
cuneatus with their nuclei, and in all cases where the branch was present this distribution
was found to be absolutely constant.”

In quoting these writers in support of precision, it is only right to say that they
appear to stress the variation rather than the precision. For example, Brrvor says :

“The fact that so small a body as the corpus subthalamicum can receive its blood
supply from two different arteries is against the theory that the arrangement of
the blood supply can have functional significance, as it appears to be purely
anatomical and not distributed according to the physiological action of the part.”

This is in marked contrast with Joun H1ron’s conception (1880) :—

“There is a disposition on the part of anatomists to think and to teach that nerves
are distributed with designed accuracy, but that there is little design in the
distribution of the arteries. . . . Look at the arterial distribution of blood
to the soft palate, derived from several different sources. The soft palate is
