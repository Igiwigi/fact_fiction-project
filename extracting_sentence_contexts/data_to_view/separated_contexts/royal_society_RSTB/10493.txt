However, postsynaptic mechanisms

direct experimental research of these issues, for instance with long necks being ‘write protected’ [127-130]. This finding
using learning and subsequent unlearning, would be worth- together with the fact that spine volume is proportional to the
while. These considerations also indicate that both the pre- expression of AMPA receptors [131] implies that small spines
and postsynaptic component need mechanisms to prevent should be more prone to LTP, which is consistent with
them from saturating and thereby losing the capacity for experimental observations [34]. Such pre- and postsynaptic
change.
