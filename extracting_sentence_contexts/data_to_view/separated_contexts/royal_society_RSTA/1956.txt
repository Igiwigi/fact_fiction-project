Following this reasoning, we have found that above a critical value of the forcing amplitude
normal radial stresses diverge in a finite time, and so do all other stress components. Normal

radial stresses are perpendicular to the flow direction and can bend the streamlines, giving rise : =
to the secondary flow observed experimentally [21]. Repeating this scheme systematically, in the : a
whole range of forcing frequencies experimentally accessible, we have found remarkably good 73
agreement with the threshold determined experimentally, as shown in figure 4, with no adjustable iL
parameters other than material properties and system dimensions. =

Since the present scheme relies on maximum shear stresses 1,z in the UCM base flow, it is not [4
affected by the fact that the Giesekus model with no solvent viscosity contribution is incomplete : *
for a > 0.5: shear-thinning is so intense for those values of @ that the curve of shear stress versus : S
shear rate exhibits a maximum (at shear rates near the inverse of the fluid relaxation time) and 18

decreases for higher shear rates; for stress values above the peak the model makes no predictions
about the shear rate [11,41]. Our approach predicts instead that for sufficiently large De there is
instability for all values of a, according to

where (-) represents a time average over one oscillation period. This being the case, the instability
threshold goes to infinity as a — 0, in agreement with the fact that normal radial stresses in
the rectilinear flow of the single-mode UCM constitutive equation remain finite at all driving
amplitudes.
