Solid surfaces which have been wrung together so that they seize separate in a pool of liquid only if

that liquid has a sensible vapour pressure (LX, 16).

All of the fluid between the faces cannot be forced out by any load which can he
applied. There persists a limiting layer of great mechanical stability which resists
pressure up to some million grammes per square centimeter. There are, therefore,
two stages, a first in which the Leslie pressure is adjusted to the load by fluid flowing
in or out from between the faces, and a second in which the reaction to the load is adjusted
by the elastic forces between the atoms and molecules.

In the first stage comparable mechanical states are states of equal Leslie pressure.
The proof lies in the fact that comparisons so limited yield surprisingly simple
relations between the variables.
