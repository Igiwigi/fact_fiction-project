Opposite faces of the brass were
removed at the central portion over a length of 46 cm. and plane glass windows were
cemented on, enabling a clear view to be obtained of the behaviour of the dust on the
plane floor of the tube. Cork particles placed in this tube form beautifully sharp and straight ridges, extending
right across the tube, as seen in figs. 34 and 35, Plate 25, the former showing three
groups of ridges, separated by two nodes, and the latter the central part of one group. The fact that the ridges appear broader to one side than at the middle of the tube is,
of course, merely a perspective effect, the walls of finite height being seen vertically
from above at the middle, but obliquely at the sides. The phenomena of clearance
and of the connected formation of eyes, which in this case consist simply of two straight
heavy ridges equidistant from, and to either side of, a node, and of the antinodal disc,
occur just asin the round tube. Fig. 36, Plate 25, shows a nodal eye; fig. 37 an anti-
nodal dise (or “ plate ” in this case) in a square tube.
