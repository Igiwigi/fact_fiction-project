2nd to that of the 3rd, and so on. The skin of the dorsum of the foot is shown to be
segmentally somewhat anterior to the sole.

The number of segments entering into the composition of the skin of the limb is
seen to be greater than the number of segments contributing to its musculature. To
the anterior aspect of the fore limb six segments contribute (IIIrd, 1Vth, Vth, VIth,
VIlth, VIIIth cervical); to that of the hind limb six segments also (Ist, IInd,
Ilrd, [Vth, Vth, and VIth post-thoracic). To the posterior aspect of the fore limb
four segments contribute (Ist, IInd, I[Ird, [Vth thoracic); to that of the hind
limb four segments also (VIth, VIIth, VIIIth, IXth post-thoracic).

In each limb the preaxial border is segmentally more extensive than the postaxial.
I have shown that this last fact is exemplified even more strikingly in the museula-
ture of the limb, both fore limb and hind limb.

The quadrifid or quinquifid digital partition of the free end of the limb is no ~
indication of the number of segmental skin fields in the limb.

The distribution of the fibres of the sensory spinal root in the limb, as elsewhere,
indicates a segmental significance in their constitution rather than a functional based
on co-ordination. Without denying the existence of functional factors in the pro-
gressive development of the limb, it must be admitted that there is little evidence
that the collection of fibres in each sensory root has resulted from an assortment of
the fibres with a view to assisting toward functional co-ordination.
