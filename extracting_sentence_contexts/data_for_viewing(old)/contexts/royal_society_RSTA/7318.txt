The crosses represent points deduced from (164), starting from that on the full-line curve
corresponding to 4 = 2A. Good agreement is obtained over the expected range of heights,
and the field-strength at / = 0 derived in this way agrees with that obtained directly from
(158) to within 0-1 db.

10. A GoMPARISON WITH MILLINGTON’s METHOD

In the example of §8-3 it appeared that the ground-to-ground field-strength curve given
by Millington’s method lay remarkably close to that obtained from the analysis of the
present paper. This is rather surprising in view of the fact that Millington’s procedure has
no ab initio theoretical justification in the case under consideration, and it is therefore of
interest to examine the reasons for its success in more detail. For the purpose of comparison,
it is convenient to express the idea behind the graphical manipulation of the attenuation
curves (Millington 19494) analytically in terms of the complete ground-to-ground field;
the formal extension is immediate, and, applied to two media (the transmitter and receiver
being on opposite sides of the boundary), gives the field
where H,. and H,, refer to homogeneous earths of media 1 and 2 respectively. When
medium 2 has infinite conductivity, (166) is equivalent to

A = ,/{2A,(1) A,(d)/A,(r)}, (167)
where A is the factor by which the free-space field must be multiplied to give the actual field,
A, referring to a homogeneous earth ofmedium 1. We may remind ourselves that A,(0) = 2.
