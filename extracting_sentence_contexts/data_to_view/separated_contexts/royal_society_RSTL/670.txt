The theory
of mechanics is known to explain all effects that can arise from
the action of forces, howeyer complicated, of which the quan-
tities and directions are defined with sufficient precision. This
science, having been greatly extended, and successfully em-
ployed, by Sir Isaac NEwToN, in the investigation of causes
requiring the most profound research, would naturally be re-
sorted to, for a solution of many difficulties that occur in the
theory of naval architecture, which could not be obtained from
any other mode of considering this subject. The practice of
ship building having been many ages antecedent to- the dis-
covery of the theory: of mechanics, one object of theoretic |

observation have previously discovered ; distinguishing those
which are founded in truth and right practice, from others
which have been the offspring of vague and capricious opinion,
misinterpretation of facts, and unfounded conjecture, by which,
phenomena arising in the practice of navigation are often at-
tributed to causes entirely different from those by which they
are really governed. It is also the object of mechanic theory
to investigate, from the consideration of any untried plans of
construction, what will be the effect thereof on the motion of
vessels at sea; also to suggest new combinations, by which
the approved qualities of vessels may be extended, their faults
amended, or defects supplied. These several objects, and others
connected with them, have employed the attention of many
eminent theorists, by whose discoveries naval architecture has
been greatly benefited ; yet the progress made toward esta-
blishing a general theory, founded on the laws of motion, has
not been adequate to what might be expected from the abi-
lities of the writers on this subject, and the laborious attention
they have bestowed upon it.
