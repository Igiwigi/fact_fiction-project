And since I cannot but regard those germinal vesicle-like objects as corresponding
also to some of the © hollow,” * pellucid,” and © cell-like nuclei” of Scawanxx, I ven-
ture to believe that some light may have thus been thrown upon one of the difficul-
ties left by that observer for future explanation.

389. From these remarks, however, it will be seen that I cannot adopt the opinion
of Scuwany, that the pellucid object in epithelium-cells is a © eytoblast.” And facts
made known in the foregoing pages show that the germinal vesicle itself cannot be 80
considered. 390. Scuwaxx conjectures that the contents of the cell (* zellen-inhalt”) may con-
tribute to the secondary deposits observed to take place in plants on the inner surface
of the membrane of the cell; and which, according to VatexTIN, always occur in
spiral or other lines.
