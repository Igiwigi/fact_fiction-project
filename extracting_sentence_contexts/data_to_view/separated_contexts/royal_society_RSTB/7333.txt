554 S. M. MANTON ON STUDIES ON THE ONYCHOPHORA. VII

In the malacostracan trunk region where ectodermal and mesodermal teleoblasts are
operative, the initiation of metamerism cannot be said to lie in either layer, as orderly
ectodermal and mesodermal rudiments of each segment are laid down simultaneously. These facts cannot be explained by Snodgrassâ€™s view that the ectoderm in Arthropoda
no longer carries out its primitive muscle-forming functions and thus leaves the mesoderm
to segment, apparently autonomously, as a secondary phenomenon. The ectoderm of certain
Crustacea has been shown to form many structures such as endoskeleton, fibrils, unstriated
and striated muscle, either remaining in contact with the adult ectoderm or becoming far
removed from it (Cannon 1926, 1931 and 1940; Manton 1928, 1934).* The ectodermal
derivatives vary greatly from one animal to another; for example, muscles of similar
function and position may arise from mesoderm in some animals and from ectoderm in
others.
