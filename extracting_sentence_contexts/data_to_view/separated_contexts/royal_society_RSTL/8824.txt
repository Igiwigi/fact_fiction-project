But since col. w=X col. u, it follows that
A! col. w=col. uw. A\A+1 A' col. u;

80 that the expression A'{u, A(, ...)} will yanish. The same will obviously be the case
with the results of B, and C' on the same expression ; and we may, in fact, conclude as

follows :â€”
A'{u, A(u, ...) }=0,
B'{u, A(u,...)}=0,
C{u, A(u,...)}=0,
D'{u, A(#, ...)} =D'AP.
