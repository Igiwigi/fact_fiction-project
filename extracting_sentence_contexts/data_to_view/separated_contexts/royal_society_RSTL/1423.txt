This comparison
cannot be extended to the salt prepared at a boiling tempera-
ture from sea water ; because the muriate of magnesia, which

proportion of muriate of magnesia, that were discovered in the several varieties of
Scotch alt, sent to me by Dr. Tnomson, For this reason, in stating the analysis of
Scotch alt, I have given, in the table, that result which was most frequently obtained ;
and have withheld the names of the manufacturers, because the differences were pro-
bably in a great measure accidental, and not the result of greater or less $kill in the
preparation, One specimen of Lymington alt, which I examined, contained fully as
much muriate of magnesia as any of the Scotch san.ples. The cat salt of that place,
however, contrary to my expectation, proved to possess a very extraordinary degree of
purity ; a fact of which I satisfied myself by repeated experiments,

* Decrepitation is occasioned by the sudden conversion into: vapour of the water
contained in salts, when its quantity is insufficient to effect the watery Å¿usion. It is
a property peculiar to salts which hold only a very small proportion of water in com-
bination, as muriate of soda, nitrare of lead, and sulphate of potash,

in several kinds of salt, inferred from the loss which they
sustain by ignition during equal times, after being first dried
at 2129.
