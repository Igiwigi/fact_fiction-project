The mechanisms that cause the annihilation of the C-points in the waveguides
considered here are likely to be generally applicable to other photonic crystal and slow-light
designs. However, we believe that alternative designs can be found to extend this useful range
down to smaller group velocities, thus enhancing the light—matter interaction with the local
chirality. In fact, it would be interesting to examine how to quantify the trade-off between the
increase in LDOS due to smaller group velocities and the directionality given by the local chirality
in the waveguide. Authors’ contributions. B.L. conceived of the main arguments, performed the simulations and contributed to
drafting the manuscript.
