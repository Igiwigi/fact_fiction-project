Interferometric GW detectors came into play internationally in the late 1970s to the early 1980s
with prototype GW antennae such as the Glasgow 10 m [18], the Garching 30 m [19] and Caltech
40 m interferometers [20]. The test masses in these interferometers were suspended as pendulums
on metal wires (typically steel music wire) looped around the barrel. The thermal noise arising


from the wires and the friction at the break-off points was deemed low enough to be implemented
in the design and construction of the long baseline detectors LIGO and Virgo. These both used
steel suspension wires (music wire) [21-23]. At this stage, the thermal noise contribution from
the wires for the 4km long arms of the LIGO detectors was still below the photon shot noise
[13] limits, and a strain sensitivity of 1 x 10-19/ ./Hz at 100 Hz could be achieved. It was clear,
however, that for any improvements in sensitivity to LIGO and Virgo to be achieved, alternative
solutions to wire suspensions were needed. In fact for GEO600, with its shorter 600m arm
length, it was determined that thermal noise from metal wires would limit the sensitivity of the
detector. Therefore, steps were taken to find alternative wire materials [24], before finally settling
on fused silica, which had more than a factor 100 lower mechanical loss than any metal wires
tested [25,26]. The thermal noise contribution from the suspension wires/fibres could in that way
be pushed below 1 x 10-19 / /Hz at 50 Hz [26-29]. A considerable research and development

effort was required to make sure silica fibres could be produced that were strong enough and : =
therefore thin enough to produce sufficiently low bounce mode frequencies [28]. The silica fibres : S
for GEO600 were produced with a hydrogen-oxygen flame pulling machine enabling the bounce : 2
frequency to be repeatable to within 3.1% [30]. The bounce frequency requirement follows from 14
mass position and angle tolerances. This in turn helps to put constraints on the fibre diameter and _
length. Also the fused-silica fibres needed to be attached to the test mass instead of being looped gg
