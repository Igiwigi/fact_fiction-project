at right angles to it.
The general case when the currents are not linear is also amenable to simp
analysis. ‘The energy associated with any linear element ids is ids{Mids’; which is
equal to ds multiplied by the component of the vector-potential of the currents in
the direction of ds, when the conducticn and convection currents move round
complete circuits. Thus, changing our notation, the energy associated with a curre
(u, v, w) in an element of volume dr is (Fu + Gv + Hw) dr. In this expressior
(F, G, H) is the vector-potential of the currents; if there is also magnetism in the
field, there will be a part of this vector-potential due to it, which may be calculated
from the equivalent Amperean currents. Thus for a single Amperean circuit,
F = ifr7! dx, which by Stokes’ theorem = i(ud/dz — vd/dy) r- dS, where (A, p, »
