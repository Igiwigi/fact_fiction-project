On the formation of the ganglion-cell.

1 now proceed to describe the changes which TI believe take place in the structure
of these ganglion-cells during their development, growth, and decay. The drawings
which illustrate these observations, although arranged s0 as to form as far as possible
a connected series, are actual copies from nature, made from very many different
specimens at intervals during the last two years and a half. The clearest as well as the
least uninteresting manner of describing the points of anatomical detail will probably
be to arrange the facts of observation 80 as to construct, as far as may be possible, a
connected history of the structural alterations occurring during the life of these elaborate
organs. But it is not pretended that the sketch can amount to more than a rough and

A imperfect outline of the process which actually occurs; for the nature of the inquiry is
Â© 8uch that it is absolutely impossible to observe the same cell at different periods of its
= life, 80 that the history is made up of fragmentary details obtained at intervals during
- a long course of investigation. S
