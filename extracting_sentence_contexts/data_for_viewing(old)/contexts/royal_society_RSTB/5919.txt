From this REprreLp drew the conclusion that ‘the melanophores are co-ordinated
by two distinct mechanisms, the adrenal secretion and the direct action of nerves. Either
mechanism alone is capable of causing the melanophore pigment to contract.” (Author’s

It is impossible to escape the impression that these results are extremely contra-
dictory. To begin with, the two passages quoted in italics are clearly inconsistent.
Secondly, if stimulation of the sciatic nerves or of the central nervous system after
removal of the adrenals causes melanophore contraction, how is one to account for a
negative result on stimulation of spinal nerves? Lastly, if denervated skin still shows
the normal reactions to light and darkness, there appears to be no reason why pieces
of skin in Ringer’s solution should fail to react, nor is it possible to account for the fact
that spinal transection in some cases caused pallor anterior and darkening posterior to
the cut.

Tn view of these considerations, one is justified in regarding the evidence of REDFIELD
for the direct reactivity of the melanophores of Phrynosoma to light as inadequate.
There remain only the observations of Haptey on Anolis equestris. Since it is em-
phasized by this worker that this is the only species of Anolis where the pigment cells
in excised skin respond to light, it is necessary, until more comparative data have been
collected, to regard this as an exceptional rather than a typical case.

In the present investigation on the chameleon the observations of Bricker have
been fully confirmed. Any skin separated from the underlying muscle becomes black
