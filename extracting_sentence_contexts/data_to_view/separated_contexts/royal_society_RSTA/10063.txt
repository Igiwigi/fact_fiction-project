Now Hirrorr has shown that in
alcoholic solution cadmium iodide and certain other salts are dissociated into ions
which are much more complicated than those occurring in aqueous solutions of the
same concentration. The only substances which we have found to be capable of forming conducting
solutions in any of the solvents which we have been investigating are certain organic
compounds, and although the nature of the ions into which these dissociate is entirely
unknown, it is probable that the ionisation is even more complicated than that of
cadmium iodide dissolved in alcoholic solution. From these considerations it was decided to use Hirrorr’s method, notwithstanding
the fact that it is much more tedious and presents greater experimental difficulties
than the alternative method of direct measurement. Hrrrorr’s method consists in the analysis, after electrolysis, of the solution which
surrounds one of the electrodes. The original concentration being known, the actual

amount of substance which has been carried to the electrode by the current can then
be calculated.
