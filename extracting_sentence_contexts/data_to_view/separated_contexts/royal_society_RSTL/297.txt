same ingre-
dients are known, to discover which of the compounds is to
be regarded as consisting of a pair of single atoms, and since
the decision of these questions is purely theoretical; and by no
means necessary to the formation of a table adapted to most
practical purposes, I'have not been desirous of warping my
numbers according'to/an atomic theory, but have endeavoured
to make practical convenience my sole guide, and have consi-
dered the doctrine of simple multiples, on which that of atoms
is founded, merely as a valuable assistant in determining, by
simple division, the amount of those quantities that are liable
to such definite deviations from the original law-of RicuTes. Having some time since computed for private use a series
of supposed atoms, I had assumed oxygen as the decimal
unit of my scale, in order. to facilitate the estimation of those

numerous combinations which it forms with other bodies: But,
though in the present table of Equivalents, I have retained the
same unit, and have taken care to make oxygen equally-pro-
minent for the same reason as before, as well as' on account
of the important part it performs/in determining the affinities
of bodies by the different proportions in which it is united to
them ; nevertheless the real measure, by which most bodies
are compared to each other, in any experiments that'I have
made, and to which I have, in fact, endeavoured to find equi-
vaients, is a determinate quantity of carbonate of lime. This
is a compound, that may be: regarded as most distinctly neu-
tral. It is most easy to obtain in a state of uniform purity ;
most easy to analyse (as a binary. compound); it is a most
convenient measure for the powers of acids, and aftords the
most distinct expression for the comparative neutralizing
powers of alkalies.
