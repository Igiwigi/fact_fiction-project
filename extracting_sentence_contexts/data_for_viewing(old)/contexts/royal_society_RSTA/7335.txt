It is not yet known whether the inactivation of carboxypeptidase involves interaction
with hydrogen atoms or hydroxyl radicals, or, indeed, with either. The low a-ray yield
compared with the X-ray yield does, however, point to the less successful competition of
enzyme in the case of the high ion density radiation for radicals of some kind which are
capable of elimination by mutual interaction. Yet it can be seen from general considera-
tions that the low a-ray yield which we have observed cannot be wholly accounted for by
a consideration of recombination within the column surrounding the a-ray track. Since

the X-ray ionic yield (7 ~3) is independent of enzyme concentration above 0:003%

weight of enzyme in solution (figure 4) we conclude that at these concentrations virtually
the whole of the ions or radicals formed by X-rays are eliminated by collision with
carboxypeptidase and only a negligible proportion by the alternative reaction. If the fact
that the a-ray yield is only one-twentieth of the X-ray yield is taken to indicate that, on
account of the high ion density within the a-ray column, only one-twentieth of the ions or
radicals make collisions with enzyme molecules before they are eliminated, the probability
of encounter between radicals and enzyme molecules must be correspondingly low. That
probability should therefore be proportional to the concentration of enzyme molecules.
It was with this point specially in mind that the influence of enzyme concentrations on
a-particle ionic yield was studied. The results, as we have seen (p. 48) are incompatible
with the hypothesis of proportionality between yield and concentration.

We know, however, that a proportion of the a-particle energy will be transformed into
Ã©-rays, which travel clear of the main column of ionization. If the radius of the column
is 0-015y the required d-ray energy is 0:4 kV. Those d-rays which have an energy greater
