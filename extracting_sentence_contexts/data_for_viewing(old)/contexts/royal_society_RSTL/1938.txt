fectly flaccid, having lost their exalted tone.

Precisely similar phenomena were observed when the frog was made tetanic
by opium or strychnine and divided into three portions, the head, the anterior
and the posterior extremities ; and in the eft made tetanic and divided into the
head, anterior and posterior extremities, and tail. Each part remained tetanic,
impressible by the slightest touch, and spasmodically contracted on any appli-
cation of 8timulus. 'The tetanus in each is instantaneously terminated by de-
stroying the corresponding portion of spinal marrow, the head, the limb, or
the tail, instantly manifesting a perfectly relaxed and flaccid condition of the
museles. The irritability remains unimpaired.

'These facts complete the proof that the phenomena which I have referred to
the reflex function, do not depend either upon sensation and volition, or upon
irritability. It is plain that the spasmodic actions in tetanus are not voluntary
actions, and they obey the same laws as the movements obseryed in an animal,
or parts of an animal, not tetanic, under the influence of stimuli. It is equally
plain that phenomena which depended upon excited irritability would not cease
whilst that irritability remained unimpairedÂ®.

The phenomena of tetanus, in its effects upon the limbs, enable us to conceive
more distinctly than we should otherwise do, the effect of the reflex function
in its natural state, in maintaining the due degree of balance and antagonism
of the muscles and firmness of the limbs.
