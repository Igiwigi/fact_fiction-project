We
have watched the process over and over again, and have been 80 struck with the
methodical action of the spines concerned in it that we find it impossible to entertain
any doubt on the question whether they are alone sufficient to perform the process, or
require any considerable assistance from the pedicellaviee. The assistance which the
latter organs furnish in this process is only occasional, and seldom seems to be urgently
required ; it appears to us clearly but an accessory, if not an accidental function, for
the performance of which the development of these organs cannot have been neces-
sitated. And, direct observation apart, this view would seem to be rendered suffi-
ciently obvious by the fact that these pedicellarizz are not restricted to the upper
hemisphere of the animal, but occur also below the equatorial line, where they can
never have a chance of seizing a dung-pellet at all. Direct observation again apart, the homologies of the pedicellarizz would alone sug-
gest that their function is probably subservient to locomotion. The valuable paper of
Professor AGASs1z already quoted derives its value from the clear demonstration which
it supplies that the pedicellari are modified spines, and therefore the most obvious
view would seem to be that they have been modified for the purpose of acquiring
special proficiency as grasping organs of locomotion, over and above that which is
presented by the unmodified or stilt-like spine.
