The “ intelligence” which, Iam bold enough to claim, is displayed by the arenaceous
Foraminifera in their house-building takes two forms: first, the exclusive selection
of certain materials, and second, the manner in which they are used. The highest
exhibition of the former phenomenon is to be found in the species Technitella
thompsoni, discovered by us among dredgings made by the Fisheries cruiser
*‘Goldseeker” in the North Sea. The genus Technitella, to which Canon Norman
first called attention in the year 1878, builds its shell normally, as described by
Canon Normay, “of the fragments of minute acerate spicula, laid in regular order
side by side, and cemented with a mortar composed probably of the finest
dust of quartz, so that the whole test is of exquisite snowy whiteness,” The
accidental destruction of a specimen of Technitella legumen, Norman, however,
revealed to us the astonishing fact that the whole shell wall consists of two distinct
layers of spicules, an outer layer in which the spicules are all laid with their long axes
parallel to the long axis of the test, and an inner layer of spicules laid with their
long axes at right angles to the outer layer, giving as close an approximation to the
woof and warp of a textile fabric as is possible with a rigid non-flexile material such
as sponge-spicules. It is obvious that by the crossing of these two layers the
