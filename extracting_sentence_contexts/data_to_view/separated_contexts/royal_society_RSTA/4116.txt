For, as we have shown, the process of breeding and our
method of extracting the data tend to produce a much more intense selection of sires
than of dams. But if we compare the mean bay range in terms of the standard
deviation of colts for our seven series of colts with that for the seven series of fillies
in Table III., we find for the first 1:27458 o, and for the second 1°33854 oy Hence
we are justified in concluding that o, is greater than oj In fact in only one case out
of the seven does the series of fillies give a less variability than the corresponding
series of colts, 7.¢., colts corresponding to dams are somewhat less variable than fillies
corresponding to dams. It must, however, be remembered that this conclusion is
based upon the coat-colour of the animals recorded as yearling foals.+ Thus, the coat-
