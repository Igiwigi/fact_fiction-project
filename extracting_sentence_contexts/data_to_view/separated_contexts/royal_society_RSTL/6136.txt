5. By these equations the state of a wave at any moment is connected with its genesis ;
and they contain in fact the complete solution of the problem of every kind of motion,
in a tube, which can be generated by a piston.

6. From (11.) it appears that u=U ; that is, that the particle-velocity generated by
the piston is transmitted through the medium without suffering any alteration. The
same equation (11.) shows that between the density and the velocity there is an inva-
riable relation, which is independent of the law of original genesis of the motion ; 80
that in the same wave, or in different waves, wherever there is the same density, there
will also be the same velocity.
