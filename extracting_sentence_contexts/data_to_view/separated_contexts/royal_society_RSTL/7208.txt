* Ds 14 Rrivs and Mancer (Ann. de Chim, et de Phys. [2] vol. Ixxv. p. 118) found the specific heat of
vitreous to be different from that of opaque arsenious acid, and considered the fact to be essential ; but their
method was not fitted to establish" 8nch a difference. Parz's view, too (Poacexvorer's Annalen, vol. exx. PP- 341 and 342), that it is of essential importance for the specific heat of hydrated sulphates whether the salts
are crystallized or not, does not appear to me to be proved by what he has adduced.
