therefore, not a general feature of this particular mollusc.

Our original interpretation of the dominance relationship between dextrality and
sinistrality requires some modification. The earlier results from line breeding gave no
definite evidence that either twist was dominant to the other, and we had an unduly
large number of results that were anomalous on any hypothesis of simple dominance :
we, therefore, suggested a rather vague hypothesis of a balanced reaction which, in the
absence of simple dominance and owing to the impossibility of a neutral position, gave
rise to two classes of heterozygote. But our subsequent experience from cross-breeding
experiments shows that this view is not tenable. Dextrality is dominant, at any rate
under the conditions in which the question can be reduced to critical experiments, and
we agree that SrurTEvaNT (1923) was right in his inspired guess (for with the data at
his disposal it certainly reached that degree) that the essential facts could best be
explained by dextral dominance and delayed inheritance, an interpretation that has
been adopted and very clearly set out by E. B. Wiison (1925, p. 1109) and T. H. Morcan
(1927, p. 261) in their text-books.

The anomalies, however, still remain and their reality has been clearly demonstrated
by our increased experience. They fall into two classes :—

(a) The production in self-fertilised lines of broods of a coil opposite to that shown by
the line. Thus, we have wholly dextral broods (‘“ dextral break-throughs *’)
