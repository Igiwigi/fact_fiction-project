The canal
is always found to be filled with solid ingesta, composed for the most part of sand
and clay. These characters constitute important zoological features. 'Ihey explain
the fact of the diminished bulk and pure water-like appearance of the contents of
the peritoneal cavity in Echinus. I have proved, as conclusively as a negative pro-

peritoneal space ; there are therefore no oyxx perforations in the parietes of the digestive czca, From the
interior of the latter organs into the former space, no fluids therefore can pass but by exosmosis. When a
fresh, living Asterias is immersed in fresh sea-water, coloured with cochineal or carmine, and allowed to
remain thus immersed for about an hour, and then carefully washed in clear sea-water, and then opened, it will
be found that the contents of the peritoneal cavity are perfectly free from the smallest trace of the coloured
fluid, while it may be always, under the conditions of this experiment, detected in the interior of the caca.
