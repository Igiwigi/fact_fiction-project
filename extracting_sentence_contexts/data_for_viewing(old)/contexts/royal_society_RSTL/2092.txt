arose within the case, which continued about five or six
minutes : this frequently happened in the other experiments.
The duration of, the observations was about twenty-five
minutes in the two preceding experiments.

On examining the column of the mean point of the needle,
I am not inclined to draw any inference respecting it : what-
ever action may have been exerted on it, does not appear to
have produced a marked or decisive effect on that point. I
was induced to insert them, from the cireumstance of the
remarkable and gradual increase of the arc of vibration in
both instances. This will be observed on looking down the
columns of half differences, which is, in fact, the amplitude
of each oscillation about the mean point.

The observed retrograde movement inthe eleventh expe-
riment being so small, and yet exceeding many times the
greatest possible error of observation, I was now desirous of
enquiring whether, amongst the- accidental circumstances to
which the needle was exposed, .there might not be found
some one to whose influence this apparent anomaly might be
ascribed. The number of causes to which it might be attri-
buted was considerable ; but I hoped by variations in the
circumstances of the experiment gradually to eliminate them.
