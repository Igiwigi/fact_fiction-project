Geoengineering presents a strong economic, political, and psychological temptation
to defer difficult and costly actions to future generations. This temptation, whether
characterized as moral hazard, risk compensation, or political opportunism, is a serious
concern because geoengineering is widely acknowledged to be an inferior, problematic,
and at best temporary option for responding to climate risks (p. 711).

However, not all commentators have expressed such pessimistic views. Bunz] [22], for example,
argued that the risk of moral hazard is far-fetched and exaggerated, because no serious actors
in the scientific or political community view it as anything other than a short-term fix or
a supplement to mitigation policies. Hale [23] argues that moral hazard arguments against
geoengineering fail for various reasons, one of which is that they are predicated on a counter-
factual imaginary of what ‘might have been’—that is, they start from the (unfalsifiable) contention
that climate policies would have been more ambitious had geoengineering not been part of the
discourse. Other commentators—including geoengineering proponents such as David Keith—
are more inclined to see the urgency and benefits of conducting research on geoengineering as
outweighing the risks associated with moral hazard arguments [24].


Curiously, though, for an argument that hinges so centrally on the perception that 4 |
geoengineering might offer a form of insurance against climate change, there has been very

little direct exploration of the moral hazard premise with members of the public. The claim 3
that geoengineering presents a moral hazard is an empirical one, about attitudes, decisions : a
and behaviour [14]. Echoing Hale’s concerns about counter-factual falsifiability, Preston [20] has : <
