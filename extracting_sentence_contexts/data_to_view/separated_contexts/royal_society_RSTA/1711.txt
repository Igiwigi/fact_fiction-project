For other approaches, we refer
to the work of Grubb & Solonnikov [38], Farwig & Sohr [39], Maremonti & Solonnikov [40] and
Geissert et al. [41]. Borchers & Sohr [42] and Borchers & Varnhorn [43] were the first to prove
that the Stokes semigroup on exterior domains is uniformly bounded. The fact that the Stokes
semigroup on exterior domains is a bounded analytic semigroup is due to Giga & Sohr [44]. The
case n = 2 goes back to Abels [45], who was in particular able to treat the case of small resolvent
parameters. For the case of domains with non compact boundaries, we refer to ยง2e.
