as one passes from the base to the apex of an elongated leaf. It is, therefore, clear that
this gradient is also the outcome of differences in the development of the epidermal
cells, since, as we have already seen, there is a marked correlation between the frequency
of epidermal cells in Scilla nutans and the stomatal frequency. And what is true of
Scilla is probably true also for other species in which a similar correlation has been
noted. The stomatal indices for the different parts of the leaf do, however, show a
uniformly higher value for the middle region as compared with those for the basal and
the apical regions, and, inasmuch as the leaves of Scilla grown in moist air in the dark
exhibit an increase of stomatal frequency in the middle region (cf. fig. 8) this increase
is probably due to internal factors.

The conclusive proof that the variation in stomatal frequency in Scilla is mainly
the outcome of variations in growth of the epidermal cells is afforded by the fact that
there is no significant correlation between the stomatal indices and the stomatal
frequencies. The correlation coefficient for these two variables is only 0-147, which is
barely twice the standard error 0-0768. This absence of significant correlation is also
shown graphically in fig. 18.

(d) The stomatal index and assimilation.â€”It was shown that comparing the yellow
and green regions of variegated leaves, a higher frequency was associated with the
yellow region ; a result that indicated the absence of any adaptational significance
for stomatal frequency in relation to assimilation rate. The following data respecting
the stomatal index for such leaves yield a difference between the green and yellow
portions of 0-4, with a standard error of difference of 0-793. There is thus no significant
difference between the two regions, and we can regard the higher frequency in the yellow
