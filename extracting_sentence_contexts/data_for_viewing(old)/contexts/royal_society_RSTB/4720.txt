That all insects, the impression of whose scales gives spectra, do not themselves
show iridescence, makes it doubtful whether diffraction is ever a main source of
colour, especially as it was found that the brilliant scales of Morpho cypris, WEstw.,
and others with the same structure, gave an almost flat impression. The probable
explanation why black and heavily pigmented scales do not give any diffraction
colours is that so little light is reflected to the eye that any colours produced would
be imperceptible. This effect may be imitated by preparing a collodion film with a
“grating” that gives a good spectrum. If, now, a few drops of an alcoholic solution
of an aniline dye are run on the film, so that it is rapidly absorbed without affecting the
surface in any way, the colour is seen to disappear, or to become very much reduced
in intensity, especially in the region of the spectrum corresponding to the dye used.
It might be expected that colour would be seen in white or light scales, and this, as a
matter of fact, does sometimes occur. Moreover, when pale scales are looked at under
the microscope with oblique illumination, a faint pink and greenish sheen, somewhat
like mother-of-pearl, is nearly always observed, In perfectly transparent scales definite
spectra sometimes appear, as may be demonstrated by the following experiment. A
collodion impression is made with Morpho achilles, Luxn., which has a layer of trans-
parent, striated scales, care being taken to insure that one or two patches of these
blue scales become detached and adhere to the collodion. The film, which should
show a bright spectrum, is tipped backwards and forwards, so us to allow the colours

to travel across one of the patches of scales. As the pale blue scales fall under the
violet end of the spectrum, they are seen to assume a much more intense colour,
changing to mauve or pink as the violet is replaced by the red. When the scales
