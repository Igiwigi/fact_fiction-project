the sternum.

The above results afford no evidence in support of the view that the sternum is
formed from the distal ends of the ribs. In the first place, in the budgerigar the sternal
divisions of the ribs are not at first in contact with the sternal rudiments, an observation
which confirms those of Bruch (1852), Paterson (1903) and Gladstone and Wakeley
(1932). Moreover, the comparatively sharp outline of the sternal ends of the rib
rudiments gives no indication of any downward emigration of cells in the sternal region
and the histological appearance differs markedly from that of other structures in the
embryo, e.g. the myotomes, where proliferation and emigration of cells are known to
be taking place.

The fact that the first mesodermal condensation of each sternal plate is continuous
with that of the corresponding coracoid, suggests that in its origin the sternum is more
closely related to the pectoral girdle than to the ribs. This does not imply, however,
that the sternum is actually derived from the coracoid.

The development of the sternum

Owing to the variation in the degree of development of embryos of the same age,
the development of the sternum is described as a series of numbered stages, the
approximate age at which each stage is reached being given.
