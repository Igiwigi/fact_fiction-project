statistically significant difference in d' between the single
and the crowded conditions.

above 1 can be ascribed to estimation error or that they did
not perform the primary discrimination task perfectly
according to SDT. However, in the crowded condition,
participants displayed clear metacognitive deficits, as the
M-ratio was significantly lower in this condition compared
to the single condition, ftp: = 4.26, p< 10°. Thus, when
experiencing crowding in the visual periphery, subjective
assessments of how well we can see deviate from optimality.
One could argue this may be due to the fact that, in the
crowded conditions, d’ itself was lower, and the M-ratio
method may not have removed the influence of this
difference perfectly, but the next result addresses this concern.

To better illustrate the basis of this phenomenon, we also
analysed average confidence in the single and crowded con-
