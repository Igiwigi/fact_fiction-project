them (i.e. negative lies). However, unlike study 1, and contrary S
to H1, the ability to detect deception did not straightforwardly
translate into gossiper (mis)trust. While participants were more
trusting of gossipers they believed were honest, as well as those

who actually told the truth about previously trustworthy
Agents, they appeared to be less trusting of gossipers who actu-

ally told the truth about previously untrustworthy Agents.

This suggests that the social benefits of being (seen to be)
honest may not outweigh the costs of sharing negative
gossip. This conclusion must be caveated by the fact that the
sample size for this analysis is rather small, relying as it did

on a single round of spontaneous lies. Additionally, some
types of lies were very infrequent in the data. It is therefore
important in future work to subject H1 to better powered
behavioural tests.
