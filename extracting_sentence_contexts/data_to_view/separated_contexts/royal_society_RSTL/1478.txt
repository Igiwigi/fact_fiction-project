At the end of the fourth
process, the volume of gas equalled about 2; of the volume
of the water. It proved to contain about £; oxygene, £; hy-
drogene, and -& nitrogene. Mr. Kirwan observed the fact that when nitrous gas, and
sulphuretted hydrogene, are kept in contact for some time,
there is a great diminution of volume, and that the nitrous
gas becomes converted into nitrous oxide, and that sulphur is
deposited which has an ammoniacal smell. I repeated this
experiment several times in 1800 with similar results, and I
found, that the diminution of the volume of the gasses when
they were mixed in equal proportions, was to rather less than
+, which seemed to be nitrous oxide. In reasoning upon this phenomenon, I saw grounds for a
minute investigation of it.
