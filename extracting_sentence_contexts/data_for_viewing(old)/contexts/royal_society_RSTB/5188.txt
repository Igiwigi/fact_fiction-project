Python molurus (Indian python).—A full grown specimen. The fundus is light Indian-
red, faintly mottled. The disc, like the Boa’s, is very small, round and mottled with
yellowish patches. There is not. the slightest trace of a pecten, or, indeed, of any pigment
on the surface of the disc, except a single small white disc, having a central black dot,
similar to those just described in the Boa’s eye. Three minute vessels, probably arteries,
emerge from the upper part of the disc, but they entirely disappear a very short distance
from it. A small vein (?), but considerably larger than the arteries, enters the lower
part of the disc. This eye is remarkable inasmuch as it shows a considerable number
of well-defined choroidal vessels along the upper part of the fundus some distance
above the dise. That they are choroidal vessels is evident from their deep orange colour,
their characteristic branching, and from the fact that the nerve fibres can be seen spreading
over them.

(5) SHAPE AND CoLour oF THE Disc.

In the Amphibia the dise shows much greater variety than in the Reptiles.
(1) Urodela (Salamandra maculosa).—This animal exhibits the simplest, and apparently
the most primitive condition of the disc. It is quite round, and very small, being only
