on their findings, the authors speculated that the

immune responses elicited by these T-cell epitopes 05

might in fact be beneficial to the bacteria rather than 2 04

to the host. In other words, rather than escaping host ES 03

immunity, MTBC wants to be recognized because the

The notion that T-cell immunity contributes to the for- essential non-essential antigens epitopes non-epitopes
