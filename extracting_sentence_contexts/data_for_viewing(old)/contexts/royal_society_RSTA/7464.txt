evident that there was a good deal of detail in the curves, and it is likely that some sub-

sidiary maxima and minima and points of inflexion were overlooked. A full study of these

peculiarities would, however, have been extremely tedious, and, moreover, probably of
little value, since some of the peculiarities were ‘instrumental’ in character, being un-

doubtedly due to the instability effects associated with the finite twisting of the crystal.

Later, a detailed study of one particular curve, in conditions such that the instrumental

effect was absent, was in fact made (see p. 17).

The modulations of the envelopes of many of the curves considerably complicate the
interpretation; evidently such modulations are caused by the presence of two terms in
equation (1) of comparable periods and amplitudes, but a detailed analysis is made difficult
by the superimposed exponential factors which are in general slightly different for the two
periods. Where the modulation is not too deep (as for y = 10°, figure 2, or y% = 57-6°,
figure 3) the mean period over several ‘beats’ should be the period of the term with largest
amplitude, while the period of the subsidiary term should be less or greater than the
dominant period according as the period at a ‘ waist’ in the envelope is greater or less than
the mean period over several beats. The difference of the reciprocals of two periods (i.e. the
frequencies) is of course given by the reciprocal of the beat period (i.e. the beat frequency).
In practice, the two separate periods could not always be determined unambiguously,
