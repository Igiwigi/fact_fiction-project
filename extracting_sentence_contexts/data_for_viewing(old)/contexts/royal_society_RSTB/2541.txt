supposedly intrastelar pith. Boopie has decribed several species of Schizea which
practically differ from each other only in the more or less complete sclerification of
the pith. Unfortunately the anatomy of the species of Schizea at present described
does not offer any series of gradations such as is presented by the American species
of Osmunda; hence, it is impossible to discuss by reference to this genus alone the
mode of origin of the medullated central cylinder, or its possible relationship to the
types presented by the stem of Lygodiwm on the one hand, and those of Anemia and
Mohri« on the other. More facts are urgently needed which may or may not be
supplied when we are thoroughly acquainted with the anatomy of all the living
species of the Schizea. Boonie follows Zenerrr (op. cit.) in deriving the type of
central cylinder found in Anemia and Mohria from that found in Schizea, and this
in turn by dilatation from the solid concentric stele of Lyyodium. In the absence of
facts bearing on the transition from one type of central cylinder to another in this
group, it seems to be impossible to more than speculate. However, on the evidence
afforded by the Osmundacez it seems probable that the type of central cylinder
found in Schizwa is derived by reduction from that which is characteristic of Mohria
and Anemia. BoopiE introduces certain general theoretical considerations which
may be more conveniently discussed at a later stage.

Gleicheniacew.—Gileichenia is monostelic. The leaf-traces of this genus are some-
what interesting. Photograph 30, Plate 4, represents the foliar bundle of Gleichenia
flabellata. It presents no special feature except the absence of phloem on the inside
of the incurved stele. Photograph 31, Plate 4, shows the structure of the foliar
bundle in Gleichenia circinata variety microphylla. Here the concentric foliar stele
has become completely closed and shuts in a mass of brown sclerenchyma. ‘This tissue
