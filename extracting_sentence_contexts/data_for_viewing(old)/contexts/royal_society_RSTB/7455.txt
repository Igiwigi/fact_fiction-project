attacking the living prey, but also remove actual carcasses from circulation.

As an illustration of the relationship between two populations of animals, one of which
devours the other, a report of Shelford (1931) on the increase of deer following the destruc-
tion of predatory animals by the early settlers of the State of Illinois may be cited. This
destruction of wolves, foxes and wild cats resulted in a continuous decrease in their popula-
tions so that they became virtually exterminated. When the population of wolves had been
reduced by approximately 50%, the deer multiplied rapidly for about 10 years and reached
a population level which was three times as high as before.

In South Africa, it is undeniable that the blowfly position has steadily deteriorated
during the last 20 or 30 years. This period roughly coincides with the rapid extension of
sheep rearing over large tracts of country, but this fact does not provide the full explanation
of blowfly increase. In the past, birds of prey and carnivorous animals formed a normal
part of the wild fauna. Unfortunately, these predatory animals do not confine their atten-
tions to the indigenous fauna but will also attack domesticated animals of a suitable size,
such as fowls and lambs. Indeed, the habit of keeping these latter in flocks and herds
renders them comparatively easy prey. In retaliation and in order to protect their livestock,
farmers have consistently destroyed these predators by every means in their power until, at

the present time, the jackal and vulture are comparatively rare in most sheep districts.

In thus solving the problem, however, other problems have been created or are being
created. Almost unnoticed for many years, the gradual extermination of the jackal and the
vulture was accompanied by an inevitable gradual increase of the many smaller, herbi-
