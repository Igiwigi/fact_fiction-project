example, voiced stops [60], round vowels and_ labial including pre-literate ones [51,77-79]. However, given that


sound-symbolic phenomena such as bouba/kiki generally
become stronger with age [34,78,80-82], more convincing evi-
dence for the idea that orthography is not the locus of bouba/
kiki comes from cross-cultural studies with speakers of non-lit-
erate societies. For example, speakers of Himba (a Bantu
language spoken in Namibia) showed the bouba/kiki effect
even though they were non-literate and had minimal exposure
to Western culture [37]. Another study found that Taiwanese
participants showed similar bouba/kiki performance to
United States participants, despite the fact that their languages
are written in different scripts [83]. More generally, a meta-
analysis of 13 different bouba/kiki experiments with speakers
of six different languages (English, French, Italian, Himba,
Syuba and Hunjara) showed that across languages, 89% of
all responses were congruent with the phenomenon [84].
However, some exceptions have also been found: Syuba
speakers from the Himalayas in Nepal did not show the
effect [84], and neither did Hunjara speakers in Papua New
Guinea [85]. Styles & Gawne [84] suggested that the lack of
effect for these two groups may be because the nonce words
have some phonemes that do not occur in the respective
language or that some sounds are phonotactically /tonotacti-
