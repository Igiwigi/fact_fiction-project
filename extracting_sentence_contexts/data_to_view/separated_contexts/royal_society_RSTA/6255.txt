In this introductory paper, we establish the underlying concept and : S
demonstrate that as few as two multipole devices can successfully cloak and shield a clamped : =
inclusion. We achieve an incremental improvement with three multipole devices and present a 8
comparison between the two configurations. In fact, our results follow as a development from :s
a)

initial simulations in §3 that display a region of ‘stillness’ in the absence of an inclusion. Immediate future work will consist of a rigorous approach to understanding the operation of
the evanescent devices and their applications in different cloaking problems. Data accessibility.
