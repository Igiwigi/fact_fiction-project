E. A. N. ARBER AND H. H. THOMAS ON THE STRUCTURE OF

of structure exhibited by Lepidodendron or Lepidophloios. The structure of some
of the Subsigillariz, in which the primary xylem is, in whole or in part, aggregated
into separate strands or bundles, seems to suggest a more remote relationship with
Lepidodendron and Lepidophioios than is the case with the Eusigillariz. The Eusigillarie are distinguished from Lepidodendron and Lepidophloios by the
fact that the stem is ribbed, and by the form and arrangement of the leaf-bases, as
well as the shape of the leaf-scar. Thus so far as the external morphology is
concerned the differences are great. When, however, we turn to the anatomical
structure, the comparison is closer.
