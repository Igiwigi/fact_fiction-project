5 29. The fact that steady mean-motion is almost confined to capillary tubes—and
that in larger tubes, except when the motion is almost insensibly slow, the mean-
a is sinuous and full of eddies, is abundant evidence of the possibility, under
rtain conditions, of solutions other than the singular solutions.
® Tn such solutions w’, v’, w’ have values, which are maintained, not as a system of
steady periodic motion, but such as has a steady effect on the mean flow through the
tube ; and equations (1) are only approximately true.

The Application of the Equations of the Mean- and Relative-mean-motion.

30. Since the components of mean-mean-motion in directions y and z are zero, and
the mean flow is steady,
