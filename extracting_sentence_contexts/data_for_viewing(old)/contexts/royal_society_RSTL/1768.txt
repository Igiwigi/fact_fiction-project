scarcely more than half of what exists between any of the other ganglia. From
the fifth they are continued to the sixth, seventh, and.80. on to-the- eleventh
segments, forming in the middle of each, one nearly spherical ganglion, [fig. 1.
(5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11),] which has scarcely any appearance of having originally
been formed of two lobes. 'The eleventh ganglion, however, is distinctly bilo-
bate, [Plate XII. fig. 1. (11),] and at this period of the larva's existence is in
reality a double ganglion, with a constriction in its-middle, which is more or
less apparent in different individuals ; so that, as was suggested to me by
Dr. R. E. Graxr, it is highly probable this eleventh, or terminal ganglion, con-
sisted originally of two separate ganglia, with short intervening cords. Â© This is
the more probable as there are no ganglia, or cords, in the twelfth and anal
segments, the parts being supplied with nerves directly from the terminal
ganglion. This opinion is also supported by the fact, that in the larya of
several other moths, particularly that of the Phalena (Bombyz) neustria, LINN.,

there are two very distinct ganglia, with intervening cords, which afterwards
unite to form the terminal ganglion of the perfect insect.
