In this instance, if the interpretation of the appearance in Lophius was correct,
the flow would be from the lymphatics of the mouth and pharynx into the “fine” system. But other considerations derived from this study of the Cod, particularly the
connection, of the “‘ fine” vessels with the arterial system in the gills and possibly also
in other parts; their blood contents and artery-like structure; the ready passage of
injection mass from them to the finer lymphatics, but not in the reverse direction,
suggest that the flow in them should be, as in the true arteries, in the contrary direction—
that is, from the gills and possibly from some of the systemic arteries to the surface,
with a return vid the lymphatics to the veins and heart. This seems likely from the facts observed in the Cod, and it is quite possible that the
exception offered by seemingly valved vessels in the mucous membranes of the mouth
and pharynx in Lophius is due to an error of interpretation. 7. Conclusions and Summary. In reviewing the foregoing descriptions, it is apparent that a system of “ fine ’’ vessels
is present and extensively distributed not only in Lophius but also in the Cod and
Pagrus: Teleosteans far removed from each other in habit and taxonomic position.
