At the point of
attachment these fine silk threads are spread out into a flower-like pattern by the close
application of the appendage. Pupa.—The pupa is more or less enclosed by the cocoon manufactured by the larva

fact that the spines on the ventral side are entangled in a number of fine silk threads

arising from the posterior end of the floor. In preserved specimens the pupa can be
easily taken out of the cocoon, but under natural conditions, where the current strongly
presses the dorsal wall of the cocoon against thé pupa, the forwardly directed hooks on
the dorsal surface of the pupa become fixed in the dorsal wall of the cocoon and anchor
the animal. Purt (loc. cit., pp. 330-333) has described in detail the arrangement of
the spines on the body of the pupa.
