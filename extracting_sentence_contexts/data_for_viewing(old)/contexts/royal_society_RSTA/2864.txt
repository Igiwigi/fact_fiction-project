well [112]. The bedding is also apparent in what few outcrops are available (e.g. see figure 1 in
[21]), despite alternative interpretation of the outcrop evidence as the product of jointing [120].
While drilling injection may have occurred, in lieu of a direct geochemical comparison between
the injection features and the drilling fluid used, it is not currently possible to verify this other
than by inference. Work on the nature and origin of these deposits is ongoing.

(c) Foraminiferal accumulation rates

Wright & Schaller [19] suggested that the sedimentary cyclicity was seasonal, lending a decadal
scale to the onset recorded at the coastal plain sites. This interpretation is contrary to the available
foraminifera mass accumulation rate (MAR) data from near the middle of the clay at Wilson
Lake, which suggests a lower sedimentation rate [110]. However, a closer inspection of these rates
shows that they are in fact compatible with very rapid deposition of the base of the Marlboro Clay
where foraminifera are extremely rare. Near the mid-point of the Marlboro Clay, the foraminifera
abundance is approximately 200 specimens g~! of sediment [110]. Using numerous lines of
evidence, Stassen et al. [110] suggest that the sedimentation rate for this part of the Marlboro
Clay is approximately 16 cm kyr~. Taking these two at face value, the corresponding foraminifera
accumulation rate is approximately 4.5 individuals g~! yr! (assuming sediment bulk density of
1.4, foraminifera density of 2.4 and average diameter of 150 pm). Independently, to match Stassen
et al.’s [110] 16cm kyr! sedimentation rate using the oligotrophic rate of 5 individuals cm~? yr!
of Zaric et al. [122], we expect approximately 223 individuals per gram of sediment, very close
to the value computed above. Importantly, if we apply this foraminifera MAR to the abundances
observed near the base of the clay (between 1 and 3 individuals g~!) we arrive at a sedimentation
rate of the order of several metres per thousand years, or ca 2cmyr™! at ca 1.6 individuals g~1.
This rate is consistent with Wright & Schaller’s [19] estimate of 1.8cmyr~! and a decadal scale
