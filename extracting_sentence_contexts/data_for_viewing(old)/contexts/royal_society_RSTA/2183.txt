3. Modular functions and BPS state counting

In supersymmetric quantum field theories and string theories, a special role is played by what
are called BPS states. The initials BPS stand for Bogomolny, Prasad and Sommerfeld, who did
early work analysing equations for soliton states that were later understood to be connected to
supersymmetry. BPS states are in special, ‘short’ representations of the supersymmetry algebra
due to the fact that some of the supercharges of the theory annihilate these states,

Q*|BPS) =0. (3.1)

One of the simplest contexts where counting half BPS states (meaning they preserve half of the
supercharges) plays an important role is heterotic string theory on a six-dimensional space-time


torus. In this case, the BPS counting function is the inverse of the famous weight 12 cusp form,
