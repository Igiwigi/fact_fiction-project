Siilees we obtain the numbers
%(2m+1)'+$,  $(2m+2)*
which, respectively, enumerate the ways of partitioning the multipartite numbers
(2m, 2m...repeated s times), (2m+1, 2m+1... repeated s times)

into two or fewer parts. When the enumeration is concerned with exactly two parts we have clearly to
subtract unity in each case. In fact the generating function is

$ (Q,?+Q,)—Q 3
D;,,Q, = Dini =Q,

showing that unity must be subtracted. The numbers then become

and

4(2m+1)'—-4, 4 (2m+2)'-1. These numbers also enumerate the ways of exhibiting the composite integers
