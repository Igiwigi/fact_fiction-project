Structural composition of E. coli LPS is shown on the left. Kdo, 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid; Hep, t-glycero-v-manno-heptose; Etn,
ethanolamine; P, phosphate; Glu, p-glucose; Gal, p-galactose.

its chemical composition varies among species [2,3]. In fact, present in the outer leaflet, the asymmetry of the OM is
some bacteria synthesize a shorter version of LPS without O broken, effectively creating patches of phospholipid bilayer,
antigen known as lipooligosaccharide or LOS [2]. In addition which allow the diffusion of small hydrophobic compounds
