What seems obvious, namely a possible agglomeration of iron atoms above a specific surface
occupation (area loading), was often ignored when comparing MNg macrocycles or other metal
sources supported on different templates. Within the literature, weight ratios were usually kept
constant [20-24]. This can, however, lead to the fact that for a low surface area carbon the
chosen conditions could be above the maximum loading (i.e. where still no agglomeration
occurs) and therefore leads to the formation of inorganic side phases [10,25]. In this context,
it is necessary to gain further insights, when comparing different types of supports, into what
extent variations in the surface area occupation or variation in the support diameter (but for


constant occupation) affect the composition, ORR activity and selectivity. This is necessary, to
enable studying distinct morphological impacts on the ORR performance of catalysts rather than
an overlay of morphology and iron speciation.
