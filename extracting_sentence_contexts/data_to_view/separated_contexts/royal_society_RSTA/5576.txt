The range of the regular diurnal inequality was largest in the year of sunspot
maximum. Other things being the same, the absolute range would naturally increase
with that of the diurnal inequality. There is thus nothing surprising in the fact that
the D and H absolute ranges in 1891, 1895, and 1896 are exceeded by those of 1893,
though the character figure obtained for the latter year is less. Whether the character

figure for 1892 ought really to be less than that for 1896, and whether the
character figure of 1895 should be the largest of all, are results more open to doubt.
