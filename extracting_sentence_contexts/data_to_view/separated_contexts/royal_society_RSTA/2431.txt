W. H. BRAGG ON X-RAYS AND CRYSTAL STRUCTURE. Let the curve in fig. 23 represent one of these terms, in fact, the second. The
existence of this term implies that the medium, so far as regards the reflection
of a wave in the second order, may be looked on as a harmonic
medium of amplitude AA’, The rise and fall of the curve above
the line AB implies that the medium has a certain distribution
of density which will give a second order spectrum if the rays
fall on the medium at the proper inclination to the planes. The
area ABCD represents the mass of one atom (there being one
atom to each spacing); and of the whole, the portion A’B/CD is
ineffective so far as this reflection is concerned.
