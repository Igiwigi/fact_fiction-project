We could summarize the conundrum posited by gauge symmetries by : >
saying that the presence of symmetry transformations which by definition do not produce any 13
observable effect seem to have nonetheless direct (or at least indirect) empirical significance : =
(some examples are listed below). Also here the landscape of philosophical interpretations of :R
gauge symmetries is organized around two massive opposing views, namely the position which [3
has been called the received view (based on the thesis that gauge symmetries do not have direct : 2
empirical significance) [121], and the corresponding alternative views. On the one hand, the : iS
presence of gauge symmetries is understood as a mere consequence of the mathematical ‘surplus |
structure’ [22] resulting from the fact that a unique physical configuration can be described 7

by using different coordinate systems [116,119,120].!? In Witten’s terms, ‘gauge symmetries are
redundancies in the mathematical description of a physical system rather than properties of
the system itself’ [124]. According to this argumentative line, the act of choosing a particular
gauge adds non-physical structure, and the corresponding gauge symmetry guarantees that the
physical or ‘observable’ predictions do not depend on this arbitrary choice (i.e. that they are
invariant under gauge transformations).
