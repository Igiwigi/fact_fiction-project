As may be seen from
Witson and Hit1’s figures (ef. especially figs. 63-66, Plate 12), these lateral portions
of the Ornithorhynchus plate are strikingly similar to our lateral mesodermal bands
in their relations. The facts suggest that the head-process was originally capable of
producing “ gastral ” mesoderm along its entire length. (ii) Mesoderm, Primitive Streak and Cloacal Membrane.—Laterally the most cranial part
of the head-process passes on each side into continuity with a mesodermal sheet situated
between the shield-ectoderm and the yolk-sac endoderm and attached margi nally to the
mesothelial investment of the amnio-embryonal and yolk-sac vesicles. The limits
between the head-process and the said mesodermal sheets are not sharp enough to
permit of the precise delimitation of the head-process, but the latter probably does not
extend laterally beyond the limiting lines indicated in text-figs.
