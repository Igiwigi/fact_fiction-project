The values as arranged on p. 431 would seem
to point to 5633, 5649 with 1, about 2800 and 2820. The limit of the particular
F series on which our whole discussion of RaEm is based is 29964'20. As a fact, how-
ever, this limit can only generate in the proper neighbourhood separations of 5646,
2806, and the displacements are 54,â€”64,, 2A,+23, The dependence on these

displacements so analogous to those in X is evidence that the links in question (5640,
