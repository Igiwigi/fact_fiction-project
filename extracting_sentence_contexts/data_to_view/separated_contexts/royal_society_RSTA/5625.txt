The predictions of the SM
have been experimentally confirmed up to 11 digits of precision, such that it can be considered
the most precisely tested theory in the history of science. These are amazing results, in particular because there are extensive world-wide efforts to
detect physics beyond the SM, e.g. with experiments such as the LHC at CERN [1], Belle II at
KEK [2], CEBAF at JLab [3], XENONIT at LNGS [4] or DUNE at Fermilab [5]. These experimental

searches are strongly motivated by the fact that, despite its success, the SM cannot explain : >
several experimentally observed physical phenomena [6]. Probably the most striking example : =
is the asymmetry between matter and antimatter in our universe, which leads to our sheer : S
existence. This asymmetry requires a substantial amount of CP-violation, which is orders of a)
magnitude larger than predicted by the SM.
