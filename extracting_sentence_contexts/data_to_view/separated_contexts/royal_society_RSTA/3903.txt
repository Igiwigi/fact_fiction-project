Particles that were always chemically connected
([P1-P2], [P4â€”P5,P11], [P6-P9]) were assigned matching diffusion constants. As the CS was
always chemically connected until elimination, it was assigned the same value as P1. To emulate
the fact that the immature capsid lattice is effectively locked, capsid-related particles (P4, P5
and P11) were assigned diffusion constants, D3), several orders of magnitude lower than that
for a single capsid particle in three dimensions, while geometry potentials ensured planarity
and spatial confinement (see below). With this choice of diffusion parameters, modulated P10
diffusion still strongly dominates that of other particles involved during the reaction. Thus, it
was not necessary to apply modulation factors to other particles.
