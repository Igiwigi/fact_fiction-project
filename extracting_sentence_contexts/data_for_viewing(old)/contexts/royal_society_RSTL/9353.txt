2. Multiple Spectra.

We may roughly divide all known spectra into three kinds or orders : continuous
Spectra, line spectra, and, standing between them, spectra of fluted bands or channelled
Spaces, as they are commonly called.


33 DR. A. SCHUSTER ON THE SPECTRA OF METALLOIDE.

Continuous spectra.â€”During the first years of spectrum analysis 16 was generally
supposed that a continuous spectrum was characteristic either of a 80lid or of a liquid
body ; but as our experimental knowledge gradually increased, it was found that the
fact of a body being in its solid, liquid, or gaseous state only indirectly influenced the
order of the spectrum. It was believed at firs that a chemical compound always
showed the spectrum of its individual molecules ; in other words, that the vibrations
of the molecules were made up of the vibration of the component atoms. If we accept
this theory, then, of course, we have only one explanation of the different orders of
spectra, viz., the influence of one molecule on another. According to this view, the
state of aggregation of the body must be the direct cause of the change in the spec-
trum. K&8ince the work of Mrrcueruon, however, it has gradually been recognised
that a combination of atoms changes entirely the spectrum. This change is not slight,
but fundamental. The whole vibrating system seems to haye been altered ; and there
is at present, in the yas majority of cases, no hope that we may consider the vibra-
tions of a molecule to be only the slightly disburbed vibrations of the atoms. We
have now a second cause for a change in the different orders of spectra. We need no
