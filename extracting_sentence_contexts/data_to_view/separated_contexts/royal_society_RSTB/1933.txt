As
divergence of the characters of the two forms, the sexual and the asexual, continued,
the latter would form a vegetation capable of shading the soil and keeping it moist. The conditions necessary for the development of the spores into the sexual form and
the ready fertilisation of the latter would be ensured, and the prothallus would persist
as a stage in the life-history. Any tendency to increase in complexity would be
checked by the fact that fertilisation and the development of the sporophyte would
bring about the death of the gametophyte. As the two generations continued to
diverge from one another, the early stage of the sporophyte in which it resembled the
gametophyte would become reduced, and ultimately disappear. The above hypothesis may prove to be of use in showing that it is possible to form
a connected view of how a regular alternation of generations, such as that seen in
Ferns, may have arisen by the differentiation of two primitively similar (homologous)
individuals, the one into the sexual the other into the asexual form.
