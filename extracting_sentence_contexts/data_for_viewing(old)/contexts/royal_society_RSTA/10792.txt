with considerable accuracy. The whole of this large difference between Mrs. AYRTON’S
equation and the experimental results is due to the fact that the equation is based on
the range of are lengths of from 1 millim. to 7 millims., and that the equation no
longer represents the facts if we extrapolate any considerable amount. Even over
the range of from 1 millim. to 7 millims. the connection between the P.D. and length
for constant current is not accurately a straight line, as can be seen either in
Curve VII. or by a careful examination of Mrs. Ayrron’s experimental results.

Tf the are length was kept constant and the current varied, a similar difficulty was
found with very small currents of 1°5 ampéres and lower, namely, that the observed
P.D. was less than the calculated P.D., so that Mrs. Ayrron’s equation can only be
considered as approximately representing the facts within the limits she used, and
must not be applied to very small currents or long are lengths.

Taking, in the present case, as limits from 1°5 ampéres to 12 ampéres, and from
1 millim. to 6 millims., then the results obtained with the are between 11 millims.
solid “Conradty Noris” carbons can with a very fair approximation be represented
by the equation

V = 396 + 1-71 + (15°5 + 11°50)/A,

which is in very close agreement with the equation given by Mrs. Ayrron for solid
‘* Apostle” carbons, 11 millims. and 9 millims. diameter, for the range 1 millim. to
7 millims., viz. :
