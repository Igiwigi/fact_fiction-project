a wide range of invasive measurement techniques,
such as optical and electrical probes and wire-mesh
sensors [1], as well as non-invasive techniques, such
as ultrasonic measurements, electrical tomography,

gamma-ray tomography [2] and X-ray tomography [3]. The advantage of non-invasive methods
is—beside the fact that the flow is not influenced—the applicability at high temperatures and high
pressures as well as for chemically aggressive substances. Further, a high spatial resolution and a
good material penetration capability are provided in general.

X-ray tomography is based on measuring the attenuation of X-rays with initial intensity No
along determined paths L. If one assumes monoenergetic radiation, the intensity N of an X-ray
beam is linearly attenuated according to

N=Noexp (- I, w(hal), (1.1)

where j(/) is the distribution of the linear attenuation coefficient of the material along the beam
path. The sum of the total attenuation of X-rays is caused by four different physical effects: the :
photoelectric effect, incoherent scattering (Compton scattering), coherent scattering (Rayleigh =
