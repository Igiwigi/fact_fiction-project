soap film is entirely new. We hope that the observations which we have made on it

will be of interest.
â€˜It is difficult to assign a reason why the addition of salt to the liquid should
uce so great a change in the results. In part, the better conducting salt
probably masks effects which when soap alone is used become predominant, but we
think it likely that in part at all events it actually prevents the changes to which
the change of conductivity is due.
