§ 14. Analysis of Strain-Time Curves.

We come now to the analysis of the individual strain-time and retardation-time curves
under constant load. This has proved one of the most troublesome parts of the whole

investigation. As already explained in § 7, an exponential formula of type (21), which
was indicated by a mixed elastic-viscous theory, entirely failed to fit the facts. A
variety of possible laws connecting 8 and ¢ were tried, with greater or less success.

The fact that initially 8 was finite, but S infinite suggested

S = §-bat’,
n being an exponent less than unity.

Tt was found that » = 4 gave a fair fit for the whole range of the curve, a result which
confirms the observations of Dr. E. N. pa C. ANDRADE on lead wires (* Roy. Soc. Proc.,’
