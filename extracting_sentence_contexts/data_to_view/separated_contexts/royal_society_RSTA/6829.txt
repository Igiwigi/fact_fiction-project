The non-vanishing of ¥ gives rise to
Bormal stress effects in the liquid.

§ On the basis of a very simple molecular model for a concentrated high-polymer solution,
Bhas been shown (Rivlin 1949) that "+0 for such a solution and, indeed, might be expected
® be large enough to give rise to normal stress effects of appreciable magnitude. In this
fheory the non-vanishing of ‘ arises as a result of the orientation of the high-polymer mole-
Gales in a solution in which a velocity gradient exists. This orientation of the high-polymer
Molecules is also responsible for the elastic character of a high-polymer solution, and in this
fact there may well be some point of contact between the phenomenological theory advanced
By Rivlin (1948 a) and the theories in which an elastic origin for the normal stress effects
introduced phenomenologically.
2 A number of experimental arrangements have been used to demonstrate normal stress
Gects i ina variety of liquids. However, very few normal stress measurements of quantitative
enificance have been made. Russell (1946) has used a number of techniques for measuring
fhe normal stresses associated with steady-state laminar flow ofa variety of gels and solutions.
& most of his measurements the working material was contained in a rotatable cylindrical
