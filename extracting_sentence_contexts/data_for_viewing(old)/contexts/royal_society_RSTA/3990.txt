or chemical potential). Considering @ and A as new real ‘alchemic’ thermodynamic variables
is an attempt to enlarge, at least theoretically, the scope of AMR. Further work is needed to
complete this picture. For instance, the full AMR thermodynamic scenario requires an equilibrium
condition for 4 arising from an alchemic extension of the second law.

To start with any thermodynamic analysis, one needs to specify the constraints of the AMR
total system and 4 subsystems. The global constraints depend on the AMR method. One can
include three set-ups: H-AdResS, AdResS and OBMD. All of them fix the total volume V, whereas
H-AdResS and AdResS also fix the total mass as WV. H-AdResS can be made either insulated
(no heat exchange with exterior), isolated (constant total energy) or isothermal (by a global
thermostat). AdResS just ensures momentum balance, and does not explicitly treat the heat

1m fact, it is also possible to use A = AN as the extensive quantity and @ = @/N as the intensive one. The work would then be
@AA. The determination of the best choice will have to wait for a practical implementation on this idea.


produced in the hybrid layer. In AdResS, such heat (appearing in equation (2.1) and its entropy
(2.2)) comes from the free energy difference between models [22], and has to thermalized. Finally,
in open MD (OBMD) [10,16], the total system is open to ‘the surroundings’ (variable V’), and the
total chemical potential is fixed.

(a) Global constraints

Global constraints permit one to derive the thermodynamic potential of the total AMR system. To
that end, we follow Heiss [23],
