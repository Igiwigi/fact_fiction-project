Now the values of 9, 9, @2,..., may be obtained for each year from the rain
record, and by correlating them with the crop data, we can obtain the values of
%, %, %g, ... , a8 partial regression coefficients of the crop on the coefficients of the rainfall
distribution ; then from (IV) we can evaluate the expansion of a@ to as many terms as
we have obtained. It is easy to verify that in the same manner the double regression
integral may be expressed as a quadratic regression formula for the crop in terms of the
rainfall distribution values.

The advantage of this indirect method of attack lies not only in the facts that for a
fine division of the year, the arithmetical difficulties of a direct attack are insurmountable,
and that no existing crop record is sufficiently long to justify the calculation from it of
50 or 60 independent regression coefficients, for the probable error of such determinations
depends on the excess of the number of observations over that of the coefficients evaluated
(9), but also in the increased accuracy attained through utilising our knowledge that the
regression function must in fact vary relatively slowly. This advantage is analogous to
that obtained by the author in collaboration with Miss Mackenzie, who found that using
the correlations of weekly rainfall between different stations in Great Britain from a
record of about 40 years, it is possible to estimate the correlation, for any one week
of the year, with an accuracy which, for any single week, would have required records
for over 1,000 years ; this was due to the fact that the sequence of correlations could be
well represented by a harmonic curve of only the second order, so that use could be made
