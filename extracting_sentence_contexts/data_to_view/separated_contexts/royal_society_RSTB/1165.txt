where, according to BEEVoR and one of us, the upper and lower limb areas tend to
overlap, with the same stimulus as in the latter case this region was the last from which
any effect could be produced in the fibres of the dorsal cord. Even in the case where
the whole cortex was very excitable, and where a generalised effect was thus easily
evoked, and where, consequently, electrical effects in the cord followed stimulation of
the upper third of the upper limb area, the general effect was, nevertheless, most
markedly graduated from the centre of the lower limb area in diminishing order as
the electrodes were removed downwards and passed the level of the superior frontal
sulcus. We may now allude to the obvious inference that might be drawn from these
experiments, namely, that although there is no sharply marked line of demarcation
between the cortical foci, there is nevertheless in the facts we have just stated a
certain amount of evidence against the assumption that the lower limb, for example, is
represented to any marked degree in the upper limb area of the cortex. We do not
speak with great positiveness on this point, because it may well be that the instru-
ment we chiefly used in this branch of our work, the electrometer, was not sufficiently
delicate to show the extremely minute variation which might be supposed to result
from the excitation of only a very few fibres. That this indeed seems probable is
shown by the results of two experiments which we performed with the galvanometer
instead of the electrometer.
