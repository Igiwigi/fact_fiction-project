C=B-log,(1 + SNR), Ql) :2

where B is the bandwidth and SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio of the channel. aes

Since its derivation, over 60 years ago, coding and information theorists have tried to approach 1s
this capacity limit with low-complexity coding schemes. For binary modulation, they have indeed
succeeded, with performance within fractions of a dB [22]. A good review of these efforts can be
found in [23].

The use of the information-theoretic capacity concept for the optical fibre channel dates back to a
the work of Splett et al. in 1993 [24]. However, it is only recently that this concept became popular [=
in the optical fibre literature. This was prompted by the slowing in the dramatic capacity growth, :8
outlined above [25], which had become constrained due to the fact that the optical fibre channel is :
nonlinear. The channel capacity analysis has turned out to be surprisingly difficult. A good review areal
is given by Essiambre & Tkach [26]. eae

The optical fibre channel is fundamentally nonlinear, which means that the refractive index of a]
the propagation medium neg changes in response to the strength of the square of the electric field DN
E or optical intensity I, as

Nogg = No + NI, (2.2) : FS

where ng and nz are the linear and nonlinear refractive indices, respectively; the normalized time
averaged electric field E is related to optical intensity as |E| = /P, where P is the optical power
in the fibre and I = P/Agg with Ags the effective area of the fibre. For silica, ng Â© 1.5 and np ~3 x
