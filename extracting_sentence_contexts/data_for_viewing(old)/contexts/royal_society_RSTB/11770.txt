Actually, the ending point of this slippery slope corresponds
to what we could name ‘pan-consciouscism’, by analogy with
panpsychism and its pitfalls. Under the P-Cs theory, any aspect
of our mental life could be labelled as being P-conscious, and
the very notion of unconscious cognition and mentation
could be simply discarded. Consider, for instance, a visual
stimulus presented to a subject unable to report its presence.
Such a situation can occur in patients or in healthy individ-
uals in various pathologic or experimental conditions such
blindsight, neglect, subliminal perception, attentional blink,
change blindness or attentional blindness for instance. How
would P-Cs theory categorize this non-reported stimulus: as
P-conscious or unconscious? If one would rely on the fact
that the individual ‘is in some way aware of having it’ to
label it as P-conscious, then we are back to the previous
issue we raised: P-conscious status would exclusively rely

on subjective report, and would, therefore, be included
within the content of A-Cs. Alternatively, it is easy to see
that no solid criterion enables us to tease apart these two
categories: P-conscious versus unconscious.

In sharp contrast, reportability theory provides a clear
delineation of conscious representations (accessed) and can
be used in the framework of the global workspace (GW)
