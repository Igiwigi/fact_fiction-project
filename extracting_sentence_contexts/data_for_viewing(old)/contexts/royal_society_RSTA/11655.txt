is partly accounted for by the slowness with which the 8 body takes up its full amount
of tin. When the concentration of tin in the 8 body is lower than 16 per cent., the
transformation on cooling is retarded until a lower temperature is reached; at the
same time the intensity of the reaction falls off until, with a tin content less than
8 per cent., the 8 form appears to remain stable down to the temperature of liquid
air. The fact that the intensity of the reaction falls off so markedly as the concen-

tration of tin falls below 16 per cent. suggests that the actual separation of the tin

S
itself is to some extent the source of the heat evolved, but it is not at present possible
to discriminate between the various possible sources of heat in a complex reaction.
The fact, however, that both the temperature and intensity of a change of this kind
varies with the concentration of the dissolved element finds it analogue in the higher
arrest-points of low-carbon steel.

A point of some difficulty yet remains to be dealt with. The data of the cooling-
curves show that this heat-evolution diminishes to zero at or near the concentration
of the eutectic alloy, and it is therefore evident that the transformation is confined to
the structurally free lead constituent, the lead-rich constituent of the eutectic taking
no part in the reaction, This fact can only be reconciled with the Phase Rule by
supposing that while the structurally free @ solution and the lead-rich constituent of
the eutectic must be the same phase when first formed, yet the lead constituent of
the eutectic retains the 8 state (in meta-stable equilibrium) when the transition
temperature is passed. This explanation is rendered probable by the observation
