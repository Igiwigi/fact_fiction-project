The final eftect is total
paralysis and death. Deoxygenation of the blood, as by asphyxia, provokes exactly the same sequence
of events. These facts prove the apparent universality of the law that whenever a
healthy neuro-muscular tissue is rendered anemic, a stage of hyper-excitability of
function precedes that of paralysis. It has, moreover, been determined that the
onset of these two stages is markedly delayed by cooling of the tissues, and this is so
both in mammals and in cold-blooded. animals.
