appear moderately mature; but it might not have been quite ripe, so that we cannot
tell whether or not it was separated from the scale, or whether the cone itself broke
up into separate scales as it ripened.

Affinities.â€”The structure of this cone is, without question, different from that of
any living genus. It is difficult to say whether it can be justly included in any
living family.

The general organisation of the seed itself, apart from the free nucellus, is so
similar to that of the Cycads as to suggest direct connection with them. Taking
the free nucellus into account, Trigonocarpus seems to come closer to the fossil form
we are now describing than any other described form. These not impossible lines of
affinity are complicated by the fact that the seeds were borne singly on scale-like
sporophylls which were united to form a cone. The scale appears to have been
a simple one, not like that in Araucaria, where there is a ligule, and, further, the
relation of seed and scale is not like that in Araucaria. j

As there is no family, either recent or fossil, in which we can include this
fructification, we feel that we are not going too far in founding a new family for the
plant, which would be among the simplest Conifere. Of course, the vegetative
