slightly converging towards this centre.

In the development of the accessory articular surfaces upon both anapophysis and
parapophysis of the last dorsal and lumbar vertebra, the Megatherium manifests a
more direct departure from the Sloths and a proportionate affinity to the Anteaters.
The Armadillos, which likewise possess these accessory joints, have superadded pecu-
liarities of the posterior dorsal and lumbar vertebrze, in relation to the support of
their peculiar bony armour, of which the Megatherium offers as little trace as do the
Myrmecophage : I allude to the progressively and rapidly increasing length of the
metapophysis *. These, in the lumbar region, equal in length the spinous process
itself; to which the metapophyses bear the same relation in the support of the over-
arched carapace that the tie-bearers do to the king-post in the architecture of a roof.
From the fact of the metapophyses in the dorsal and lumbar vertebrae of the Mega-
therium, Plate XVII. and Plate XIX. figs. 4 and 5, m, not being developed beyond the
state of a tubercle, I long ago drew the inference that, like the Sloths and Anteaters,
it was not covered by a bony armour.
