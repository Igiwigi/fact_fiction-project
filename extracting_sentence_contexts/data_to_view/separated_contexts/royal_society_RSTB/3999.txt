In any case, whether the ampulla is
active or passive, its relation to the dorsal sac receives a natural explanation on
the lines indicated above. T cannot but conclude that there is a circulation in the hemal system of Asterias,
and that the following are probably among its chief features: (1) A transference
of fluid, nutritive but not respiratory in function, takes place along the gastric
heemal strands from the stomach absorbents to a node at the junction of head
process with the axial organ; (2) the head process of the axial organ acts as a
pulsating ampulla, or “heart,” connected with this node and also with the tissue
spaces of the aboral body wall; (3) the axial organ contains efferent channels
which supply the oral hemal ring, and through that the various radial hemal
strands ; (4) other main efferent vessels pass along the aboral perihzemal sinus, and
send off branches to the gonads in each inter-radius. According to this view “ hzemal” channels efferent from the heart are distributed
in the near neighbourhood of all the structures (not belonging to the digestive
system) which have the greater physiological activity, viz., the nervous system,
the gonads, the muscles of the tube feet and of the ambulacral ossicles,

This account of the probable circulation in the Asterid hemal system is supported
by the fact that there is a corresponding circulation in what I believe to be the
homologous hemal structures of Balanoglossus (see p. 278). It will also be
remembered (p. 248) that contraction of the floor of the dorsal sac in a double-
hydroceele larva progressed from behind forwards. Whether there is a full circle
in the starfish circulation, and what may be the probable course of circulation
within the hemal system of other echinoderms, are too wide questions to be
discussed here, but it may be noted that while in Holothurians a dorsal sac and
an axial organ are apparently absent, contractions of the longitudinal vessels of
the intestine occur (49, vol. 2, p. 450).
