In order to classify the partial differential equation (4.15), one has to examine only the principal
(fourth-order) part of the differential operator related with the Cosserat moduli by (see for
instance Renardy & Rogers [17]). This implies that the classification of equation (4.15) for the
time-harmonic response remains the same as for the quasi-static case. In fact, the latter case
was examined in Gourgiotis & Bigoni [4], where the conditions of ellipticity (E) were explicitly
derived. Here the elliptic regime only is considered, defined through the following conditions [4]:

(E) © bo>0 and bo>—Vbzbi, (4.17)

holding for by > 0 (the bending stiffness in the y-direction is assumed to be always positive).
In particular, two regimes of ellipticity (E) can be distinguished:

(i) the elliptic imaginary (EI) regime for bz > 0, bo > /b2b4; and
(ii) the elliptic complex (EC) regime for bz > 0 and —./bzb4 < bo < /b2b4.

The emergence of weakly discontinuous surfaces corresponds to failure of ellipticity, as in the
