In addition,
delayed in vivo development has been observed for female
embryos in several other species such as cows, rats and
humans [1]. For more detailed mechanistic studies, embryonic
stem cells from these species will be valuable model systems. The use of human ESCs for studying X-dosage-dependent
effects has so far been hampered by the fact that most cell lines
adopt a state where one X-chromosome is at least partially
silenced [54]. A recent study has characterized the X-inactivation
status and the differentiation potential of a series of female
human ESC lines in detail [55]. The finding that lines with two
active X-chromosomes maintain this state during differentiation,
shows that double X-dosage in human ESCs does not comple-
tely block differentiation.
