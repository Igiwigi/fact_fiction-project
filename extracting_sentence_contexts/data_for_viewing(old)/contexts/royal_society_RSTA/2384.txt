understanding planetary atmospheres can be enhanced.

He and beyond’.

]. Introduction

Hydrogen, the most abundant cosmic element, also dominates the composition of giant
planets. Consequently, the most prominent ion species in giant planet atmospheres are the
stable H*+ and H? ions [1]. The proton, Ht, is not spectroscopically observable, whereas
the spectrum of Hi is exceptionally rich, particularly the v2 vibration rotation band in
the near-infrared [2], a spectral region accessible from Earth’s high-altitude observatories.
In fact, the first astronomical spectroscopic detection of Hj, enabled by a confluence of
evolving theoretical, laboratory and observational advances, was made in Jupiter’s auroral
region [3]. Further detections at Saturn and Uranus, and continued ground-based monitoring
of Hy at Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus in the subsequent decades, have demonstrated its
remarkable effectiveness as a probe of giant planet upper atmospheres (e.g. [4-11] and references
therein).

At present, the field of comparative aeronomy—that is, the comparative study of planetary
upper atmospheres—relies on a sparse sampling of remote diagnostics, especially for the giant
planets. Vertical thermal structure, in particular, is difficult to determine remotely, and yet it
plays a primary role in identifying the relevant physical processes at work in planetary upper
atmospheres. There are only a handful of temperature profiles obtained for Jupiter [12], Uranus
and Neptune, primarily from the Voyager spacecraft [13-15], whereas Saturn has now been
