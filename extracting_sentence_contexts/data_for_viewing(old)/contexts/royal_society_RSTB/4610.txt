possibly this contention also holds good for the so-called sterile castes of Mastotermes,
Termopsis, and certain of the more primitive members of the Calotermitine. If
there be any truth in the present hypothesis, it is obvious, from the preceding
diagram that, owing to differences in their gametic constitution, a certain proportion
of the soldiers would ipse facto not breed true ; or, in other words, their offspring
would comprise both soldiers and winged sexual forms or all three castes. The same,

of course, also applies to the workers. Thus, if we crossed an AaSSFF soldier with
an aa@Sskf soldier we should obtain soldiers, workers, and winged sexual forms among
their progeny. This, as a matter of fact, has been actually recorded by Hearn
(1902, p. 59) in the ease of an egg-laying soldier of Yermopsis angusticollis, He
states that the development was followed for a long time, and “the young, and the
nymphs and workers into which they became transformed, appeared in all respects
perfectly normal.”
In the greater number of the Termitidee, however, the fertility determinant F has
~ become lost in the soldier and worker castes, and their gametic constitution is no
a hail aSF and AsF, but aSfand Asf respectively. In the case of Termes strunchii,
Sin which gynzecoid workers are recorded by Stnvesrrr (1901), fertility may not have

A confess it is almost impossible to hazard an opinion.
