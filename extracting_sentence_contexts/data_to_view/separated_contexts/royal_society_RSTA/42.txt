In their seminal |
paper, Lasry & Lions [35] on mean-field games also presented a parabolic free boundary problem : S
modelling the evolution of the price in an economic market with a large number of agents, where : 3
a single good is traded. This one-dimensional free boundary problem is—strictly speaking—not [&

a mean field game, but it exhibits very remarkable mathematical features which make it difficult
to treat by standard free boundary techniques. In fact, the Lasry—Lions price formation model
has attracted a lot of attention so far: preliminary analytical results were given in [57-59] and
a rather complete existence, uniqueness, regularity and long-time asymptotic analysis based on
a geometric method can be found in [60,61]. A derivation from a mesoscopic Boltzmann-type
system using a scaling limit technique (high trading frequency) can be found in [62] and a
hyperbolic-type scaling limit in [63]. Extensions incorporating stochastically fluctuating markets
are in progress [64]; however, we remark that significant further steps have to be taken in terms of
modelling (e.g. incorporating utility functions) before applications to realistic economic markets
can be tackled.
