On this day, as on the 20th, my attention was strongly drawn to certain bright regions

I had to search therefore for a new one; I found one on the eastern equatorial limb. The method of observation previously adopted was changed, and a mixed spectrum of
the swn's limb and prominence was obtained. 'The two spectra were in fact snperposed. In the case of the line at C, the result was to absolutely eclipse the dark line in the
spectrum, and to replace it by a vividly bright band (Plate XXX VII. fig. 5). The
behaviour of the F line was still a puzzle to me.
