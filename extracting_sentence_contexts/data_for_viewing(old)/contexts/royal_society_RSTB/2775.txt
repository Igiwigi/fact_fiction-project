therefore, supposed that they were caused by changes of “ prepotency ” accompanying
different conditions of maturity. But it has been shown in these experiments not
only that great differences are produced in the relative proportions and structure of
the skeleton of the hybrids by slight changes of temperature, but also that by rearing
them in water raised to about 20° in December, the typical summer form may be got.
That sometimes the larvee remain of the winter type, even when reared in warmer
water, is almost certainly due to the fact that neither parent normally breeds in
the winter, and, therefore, the larvee are relatively weakly. This was found to be
the case with pure-bred larvze of both parents, so that it is only likely to be still
more marked in the hybrids, since they are more sensitive than either of the parent
forms. At first sight it seems unlikely that a difference in the healthiness and
rapidity of growth should cause the plutei to resemble one parent or the other, but
this is explained by the fact that all the more important features of the Spherechinus
pluteus are of a positive nature, while the larva of Strongylocentrotus is chiefly
distinguished by their absence. And it was shown that the only positive feature of
Strongylocentrotus, the club at the apex of the body-skeleton, was not reduced in
summer, but in some cases at least actually increased. For example, in No. 244
(June 12-20) there were large clubs 8 per cent., small 88 per cent., no club 4 per cent.,
compared with large 0, small 84 per cent., none 16 per cent. in No, 33 (March 3-11).
These are typical examples of well-grown larve taken at random, and others taken
at the same seasons would give similar proportions.

On the whole, therefore, it must be concluded that the differences observed in the
larvee in winter and summer are due chiefly to the temperature, and that there is
no satisfactory evidence of a difference of donlinance accompanying changes in
