determination of cell fate during development until the cells reach a stable state
at the bottom. It was once believed that an unnecessary genetic code in committed
cells other than germ cells was released—a principle referred to as the Weismann
barrier [8]. The cloning of a frog through the nuclear transfer of embryonic cells,
but not somatic cells, in 1952 by Robert Briggs and Thomas Joseph King
suggested that irreversible changes took place in the somatic nuclei [9]. Thus, it
seemed likely that a change of cell fate was impossible once cells were committed.
However, the story took an unexpected turn with Sir John Gurdon’s landmark
experiments in Xenopus laevis, which first established the concept of the repro-
gramming of cell fate promptly after the emergence of Waddington’s dogma
[10]. The birth of a cloned sheep in the late-twentieth century, famously named
Dolly, meant that the erasing of epigenetic memories in somatic nuclei could be
achieved, even in mammals [11]. In this way, these facts suggest that an
