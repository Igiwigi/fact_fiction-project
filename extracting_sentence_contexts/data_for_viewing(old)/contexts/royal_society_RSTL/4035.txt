20 DR. FARADAY'S EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY. (SERIES XIX.)

2242. This mode of magnetic and electric action, and the phenomena presented
by it, will, I hope, greatly assist hereafter in the investigation of the nature of trans-
parent bodies, of light, of magnets, and their action one on another, or on magnetic
substances. I am at this time engaged in investigating the new magnetic condition,
and sball shortly send a further account of it to the Royal Society. What the pos-
Sible effect of the force may be in the earth as a whole, or in magnets, or in relation
to the sun, and what may be the best means of causing light to evolve electricity
and magnetism, are thoughts continually pressing upon the mind ; but it will be
better to occupy both time and thought, aided by experiment, in the investigation and
development of real truth, than to use them in the invention of suppositions which
may or may not be founded on, or consistent with fact.
