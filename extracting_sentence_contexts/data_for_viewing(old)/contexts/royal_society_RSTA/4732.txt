boundary. More exactly, one can show that there is a modulus of continuity t(d(x)) such that :8
Deev(x) = —t(d(x)), where d(x) denotes the distance from the point x to the free boundary. The :
proof is either direct using Harnack’s inequality along with iteration argument [8], or an indirect
compactness argument, and using the convexity of global solutions. The convexity of global
solutions, again, follow a simple compactness argument.

The convexity along with the thickness assumption MD(B, NM A(up))>e implies that the
coincidence set A(vg) is a convex set, with non-void interior. In other words, the free boundary
for vg is locally Lipschitz. Now the function @,v9, with e directed towards the non-coincidence
set 29 = {vp > 0}, close to the origin is non-negative (due to convexity of vg) in 29 N B, for some
small r, and also is harmonic there. In other words, we have a positive harmonic function devg in
B, \ A(vo), and that A(vg) is convex. Obviously, if A(vg) is not C! close to the origin, then vo is not
Lipschitz,° which contradicts the fact that vg is Cl.

(e) Local analysis

From the local C!-regularity of the free boundary for global solutions (as shown above), we know
that the free boundary of global solution {vg > 0} M By, (for a universal f > 0) is almost flat and
that the local solution v ~ (xf P/2 ina rotated system in Bj,.

The final step now follows by showing that w:=C;Dev — v = 0 in some smaller ball Bir (for
ty = to(e)), where e - e, > 0.” This implies that the Lipschitz norm of the free boundary can be made
as small as we wish (by taking e - e; * 0), and consequently the free boundary is C! at the origin.
As minimal diameter property propagates with €/2-value to all free boundaries in B,/2, we may
derive the same argument for all free boundary points in Bj,,/4 and claim that the free boundary
