This issue is best demonstrated in figure 1a: when the incident light illuminates the
sample, scattering occurs and produces aberrations due to the inhomogeneous sample with a
different RI. Due to the aberrations, the illumination pattern projected inside the sample becomes
distorted, which will distort the reconstruction of SR images to misleading results. Dong et al. developed SR fluorescence-assisted diffraction computational tomography (SR-
FACT), which combines label-free three-dimensional optical diffraction tomography (ODT) with
