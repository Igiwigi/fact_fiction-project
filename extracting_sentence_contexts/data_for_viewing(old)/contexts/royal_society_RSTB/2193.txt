146 DR. WALLER ON THE RETINAL CURRENTS OF THE FROG’S EYE,

§ 10. Action of Carbonic Acid.

Kiune noticed that the frog’s eyeball gave little or no response to light half
to one hour after excision, but that it became active three or four hours later.*
He attributed this temporary abolition to local asphyxia. I have shown that as
regards nerve the primary effects of CO, are to diminish the positive response and to
increase the negative response.t In view of these facts 1 have made a few experi-
ments to see whether the presumably negative-cum-positive response of the retina
could be modified in the sense of a favouring of negative and disfavouring of positive.
I had previously seen in some experiments made for another purpose that the retinal
response (positive) was abolished by CO, by Et,O, and by CHCl;, but had not
examined closely the action of CO, upon the retina as I had that of nerve.

I cannot say that I have ever seen the eyeball effect precisely as described by
Kiuye. I have never at any period during the first few hours after excision failed to
obtain the response to light. The response has at first diminished with lapse of
time, and subsequently increased. Sometimes it has started small and has subse-
quently become considerable. The event apparently depends upon the state of the
eyeball at the time of excision. Like Ktune I find that carbonic acid can abolish
