research might be-guided. ,

Alumine very. slowly finds-its point of rest at the negative
pole, in the electrical circuit ; but silex, even when diffused
in'its gelatinous/state: through water, rests indifferently atthe
negative or positive poles.

E. From. this indifference to positive and negative electrical
E attractions, following the general order of facts, it might be
£ inferred, that if these bodies be compounds, | the electrical
- energies of their elements are nearly in equilibrium ; and that
S their-state is either analogous to that of insoluble neutral salts,
