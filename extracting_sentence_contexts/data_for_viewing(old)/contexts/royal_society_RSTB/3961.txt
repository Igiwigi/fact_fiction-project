The section passes through or near a protoxylem-group; part of a scalariform
tracheide from this region is shown in fig. 7, A; a pitted primary tracheide is shown
at B, and a similar element from the secondary wood at C. :

The strands just described have very much the same structure which we might
expect to find in the stele of a branch, and it might be supposed that this was their
real nature. We do not think that such a view is tenable. We have direct evidence
(see above, p. 823) that such strands with secondary wood of their own are continuous
with the paired bundles passing out from the pith. These bundles originate by the

division of a single xylem-strand and are clearly of leaf-trace nature ; there are in
fact no other structures present which could represent the leaf-traces. Further it is
highly unlikely that two branches should be given off side by side. It might perhaps
be suggested that one strand of the pair was a leaf-trace and the other the stele of a
branch, but there is no sign of any essential difference between them.

The only possible interpretation appears to be that the strands in question are the
leaf-trace bundles, which retain their secondary wood on first leaving the stele. In
the case figured (Phots. 22 and 28) it will be noticed that the leaf-trace lies within
the general contour of the wood, though the tissue immediately around it is parenchy-
matous ; in this position it is not surprising that a large amount of secondary xylem
should still be retained by the trace-bundles.
