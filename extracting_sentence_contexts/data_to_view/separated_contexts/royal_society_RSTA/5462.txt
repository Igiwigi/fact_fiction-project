Details on the participants and signal acquisition and preelaboration are provided in
[12]. In each IBI series, we selected two segments of N > 14000 beats, in the afternoon (‘Day’
period) and after 23.00 (‘Night’ period), and calculated F,(n) as in equation (2.3) for 6 <n < N/4
beats, —-5 <q< +5, with detrending polynomials of order 1 and 2. In fact, for the heart rate
series, the second-order polynomials overfit blocks shorter than 12 beats, but at the same
time, they appear to remove long-term trends more efficiently than the first-order polynomials;
therefore, we estimated the multifractal-multiscale coefficients, ag(q, n), combining the estimates
for detrending orders 1 and 2 by the weighted average proposed in [13]. Then, as originally
introduced in [20], we mapped the scale units from the number of beats n to the second with
the transformation

t=n xX MBL (2.22)

where j1;p is the mean IBI of the series, in seconds. In this way, we obtained the coefficients a(q,
t), a function of the temporal scale t in seconds, over the range 8 < t < 2048s.
