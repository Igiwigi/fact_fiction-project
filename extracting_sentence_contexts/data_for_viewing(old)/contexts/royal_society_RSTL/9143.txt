are not chemical equations at all, for they do not satisfy the fundamental conditions
afforded by the system of indeterminate equations previously referred to,
mp+mq+m"r+...0,

In $hort, if we inconsiderately deal with these equations without reference to the
principles on which they have been constructed, precisely as though they were numerical
equations, we are not only involved in a tissue- of absurdities and contradictions, but are
compelled to introduce into the system of chemical equations, equations which do not
belong to that system at all, and which could neyer arise from the expression by means
of equations of chemical facts,


66 SIR B. C. BRODIE ON THE CALCULUS. OF CHEMICAL OPERATIONS.

It is impossible for a false or absurd result to be the consequence of the application
to a true statement of a correct principle of reasoning ; and we are thus led to the sin-
gular conclusion that, although up to a certain point the analogy is perfect between
the properties of chemical and numerical symbols, here this analogy terminates and
ceases to be a correct guide ; and we are apparently forced to admit that in the treat-
ment of chemical equations no processes exist equivalent to the algebraical processes of
multiplication and division. Now, first, we may observe that such an imperfect calculus
might really exist, logically correct, but with limited methods ; for there is nothing
