disappear at a small value, ¢ ~ 0.27. Figure 9b shows that the same area shrinks with the increase
of y, vanishing at y * 2.56.

In all the cases, the increase of the total power, P, leads to destabilization of the modes, or
to their eventual disappearance, as in the case displayed in figure 7. This trend is common for
previously studied nonlinear PT-symmetric systems [2-9].

Furthermore, figure 9c compares the prediction for the stability boundary of the PT-symmetric
mode, as given by the analytically derived equation (3.17), with the numerically found boundary,
produced by the computation of the stability as per equation (2.9). For e < 10, the analytical
result well matches the numerical counterpart. At large values of ¢, the agreement breaks down,
the numerically identified stability region being much narrower than predicted analytically. The
discrepancy is explained, as mentioned above in the different context, by the fact that the finite-
width potential barrier (4.1), multiplied by large ¢, strongly changes the model, in comparison
with the underlying one which contains the ideal delta-function. The discrepancy decreases if
smaller € is used in equation (4.1), but, on the other hand, the use of the splitting barrier with
a finite width corresponds to the physically realistic situation, as the infinitely narrow barrier
cannot be implemented in the experiment.

Lastly, PT-symmetric systems are characterized by the flux of power across the gain-loss
interface, defined as

J=i(ucu” — uyu)|e=0- (4.2)

Normally, J is a growing function of the gain—loss coefficient, y, but there are examples of systems
