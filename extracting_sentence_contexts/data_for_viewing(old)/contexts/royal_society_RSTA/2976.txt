When this phase of the analysis is completed, the high-frequency behaviour of the wave has
been obtained, but the shape and height of the wave’s envelope is still unknown, as illustrated
in figure 3e.

(ii) Obtaining the shape of the density wave's envelope

Now that we have determined the three parameters that define the shape of the wave’s high-
frequency components (9, rj, and ¢o), we now accept that shape as given and proceed to fit the
two remaining parameters (A, and ép) that define the wave envelope (i.e. the amplitude and
decay of the high-frequency components).

In the absence of other effects, the shape of the amplitude modulation (i.e. the location of
the point of maximum amplitude) is governed by the damping parameter &p. In fact, the non-
oscillatory components of equation (2.1) are proportional to € e~ 6/5)" Ifa reliable representation
of the amplitude can be obtained, the best way to fit for &p is to find the dimensionless radial
