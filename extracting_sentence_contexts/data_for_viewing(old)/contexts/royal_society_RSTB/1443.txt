though in most places somewhat separated from the wood by the
‘rootlets of Stigmaria. Many of the large parenchymatous cells of the

trictly to any one zone of the cortical tissue, but occur chiefly in its inner

there can be no doubt that we have here to do with an early stage of the
f periderm. It is certain that a secondary tissue of some kind is being

friderm was formed abundantly in the cortex ; we can scarcely be wrong in
© the two facts.

enchyma, which separate the internodal cavities of Calamites from one
