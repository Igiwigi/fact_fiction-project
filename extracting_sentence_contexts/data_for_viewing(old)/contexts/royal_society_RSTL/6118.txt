These © vacuum disks,” as I have usually called them, were in-
valuable as indicators of the planes of crystallization. When a con-
densed sunbeam was sent through the mass, the six-petalled flowers,
which always indicate the planes referred to, started into existence
parallel to the disks. Consequently, as the beam passed through
different fragments, flowers were formed, in different planes, along
the track of the beam.

'True air-bubbles, associated with water, also occurred in these
masses of ice, and such composite cells were always flattened out in the planes of the
vacuum disks. <

The fact then is that many of the s0-called air-bubbles are not air-bubbles at all, and
that the 80-called © fattening ” is in reality no flattening at all; and that pressure, in
the sense hitherto conceived, has had nothing whatever to do with the shape of these
bubbles. In glacier ice, as in lake ice, their shape is determined by the crystalline

architecture. The conclusion that they were 8queezed flat seems to have been drawn by
M. AGass1z, and reproduced by subsequent writers, without due regard to the difficulties
asociated with it. That the pressures of a glacier are 80 parcelled out as to 8queeze
contiguous fragments of ice, not exceeding a cubic inch in size, in all possible directions,
is 80 improbable, that reflection alone must throw great difficulties in the way of its
