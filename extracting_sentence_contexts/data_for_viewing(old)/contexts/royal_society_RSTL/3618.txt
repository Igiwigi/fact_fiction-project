light, to be separated from it by a valve, or duplicature of the lining mucous mem-
brane. The vaginal orifices (a a) are simply two nipple-shaped portions of the tegu-
ment, with somewhat oval apertures, surrounded by a corneous ring, from which is
developed a circle of minute hairs. Internally these apertures are closed by a oft
thickened membrane: they are situated on the under surface of the fourth segment
of the body, and correspond in that to the insertions of the legs in the third segment.

In their general structure the organs of reproduction in the female Tulus present
some analogies to those of Melve and Forficula among insects, in which the single
ovisacs are arranged on the outside of a large oviduct, into which all the matured
ova are passed, to be deposited at one act, as in Julus; but they differ from these
genera in the structure of their vaginal outlets being double, as in Crustacea and
Arachnida; and differ again from the last in the remarkable fact, that throughout
nearly its whole extent the oviduct is a single sac, and divides only into two canals,
one of which passes on each side of the nervous cord, immediately before it arrives
at its termination. Tt is difficult to give a reason for this peculiar conformation.
May it be connected with a necessity for great rapidity in the act of depositing the
ova required by this singular tribe of Invertebrata, the only apparent explanation of
this peculiarity ?

The situation of these organs beneath the alimentary canal, and their separation
from it by the interposition of the adipose tissue, extended in the manner of a peritoneal
coat, has already been stated. This adipose tissue, formed of vesicles filled with fat,
as in insects, is most extended in the course of the muscular bands that pass down
from the dorsal yessel, on each side of the segments, until they arrive at the upper
