INTENSITY RELATIONS IN THE SPECTRUM OF HELIUM. 165

By comparison of («) and (6), we see that the second member of the Principal series
is not enhanced by low pressure relatively to the first. It is in fact definitely
reduced. This series behaves accordingly in a different manner from the others. It
would seem that the phenomenon found in the other case—that of a selective transfer
of energy—is not produced.

We may also notice that the selective enhancement at low pressure of the higher
members in any one series which, as we have seen, must be regarded as a phenomenon
relating to the Diffuse and Sharp series, but more especially to the former, is one
which would be expected on theoretical grounds from a theory such as that of Bonr,
which regards lines of higher term number as due to the passage of atoms between
“stationary states” of relatively large atomic radius—a state of things to be
expected with greater frequency under the influence of a considerable reduction of
pressure. We may recall, for example, Bonr’s explanation of the great extent of
