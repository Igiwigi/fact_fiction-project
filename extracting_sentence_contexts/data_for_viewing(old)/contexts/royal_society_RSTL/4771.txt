* Tt may be proved that the force derived from a potential having the 8ame expression (VII.) (1.) as for ex-
ternal points, is, for any internal point, the force at a point within an infinitely small crevass perpendicular to
the lines of magnetization ; as it is easily shown that the differential coefficients of 47(p) are the rectangular
components of the force at such a point due to the free contrary polarities on the two sides of the crevass.

being s0lenoidal which it presents ; while the formulze of Q 76. merely expresses a fact
with reference to lamellar distributions, and being only applicable to lamellar distribu-
tions, do not indicate the effect of a deviation from being lamellar, in a distribution
of a general form. Certain considerations regarding the comparison between common
magnets and electro-magnets, suggested by Amezre's theorem that the magnetic
action of a closed galyanic circuit is the same as that of a © magnetic shell” (as de-
fined in $ 67.) of any form having its edge coincident with the circuit, led me to a
synthetical investigation of a distribation of galvanism through the interior and at
the surface of a magnet, magnetized in any arbitrary manner, from which I deduced
formulz, for the resultant force at any external or internal point, giving the desired
indication regarding effect of a deviation from being lamellar, on expressions which,
for Jamellar distributions, depend solely on the tangential component of magnetiza-
tion at points infinitely near the surface. These galvanic elements throughout the
