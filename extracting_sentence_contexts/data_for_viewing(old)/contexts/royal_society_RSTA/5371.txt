removal of organic addends was successfully conducted by simply heating the hydrogen complex
H2@1 at 340°C under vacuum (scheme 1, step h) [6], affording the desired H2@Cgo, with a 9% total
yield based on consumed C,o, as a stable material, which can tolerate heating at 500°C.

The encapsulated hydrogen molecule exhibited a 'H NMR signal at 5-1.44ppm, which is
almost 6 ppm upfield-shifted when compared with the signal of the free hydrogen molecule
(6 4.54), indicating quite high aromaticity at the centre of the inner space of C¢o. But, much more
detailed and sophisticated studies on the NMR of this molecule have been conducted by the group
of Levitt and co-workers [7]. The molecular hydrogen inside the fullerene cage gives us a good
opportunity to study its spin chemistry and physics, as well as NMR, which have been carried out


actively by the group of Turro and co-workers [8]. In fact, we did not expect that our compound
H2@C¢9 would become the object of such wide and in-depth studies by many international
research groups. It is, indeed, our pleasure and honour that the compound we made has attracted
such great academic interest from various disciplines ranging from chemistry to physics. We
believe that a new scientific field will be developed from the concept of ‘nanolaboratory’.
