Plates were coated with poly-.-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, P4707) over-
night and fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich F1141; 1 : 1000) for 1 h at 37°
C. Cells were differentiated with differentiation medium (DMEM/

mycin; N2 supplement; T3 (Sigma-Aldrich T6397; 40 ng ml")
for 2.5 days.

(b) FACS isolation of hair follicle populations

Back skins from Krt14:H2B-GFP mice at P2 were dissected and put
in HBSS (Thermofisher Scientific (Gibco)) with 20% collagenase (in
PBS (Sigma-Aldrich)) for 1 h at 37°C, after which the dermal /hair
follicle fraction was scraped off and collected using centrifugation
(300g for 10 min). The pellet was suspended in trypsin and incu-
bated for 15 min at 37°C. Cell suspensions were filtered using
both 70 and 40 ym filtres, washed twice in PBS and pelleted
using centrifugation for 5 min at 300g [40]. Epithelial hair follicle
cells were H2B-GFP positive. Interfollicular epidermal cells were
excluded using SCA-1 PerCP-C5.5 and two hair follicle cell popu- Cul f Oli- I
lations were isolated based on high/low CD49f (a6 integrin (g) u tu re 0 I neu cells .
