Consequently 9’ ~09,
and hence for us y ~ £1. In terms of geometrized coordinates, the y; are unitless. This follows from
the fact that

9g 0
yildg) = 5 ~e-

Since gi ~ 09, we can use equation (1.4) to deduce that f ~ £°, as it does in equation (1.7). Later
when dealing with the more general FLRW metric given in equation (1.5) with k 40, I shall still
require gij dxidd ~ 02, f ~ £9 and g~ ¢!, but then some coordinates of T*M will have units and
others might be unitless. Lastly, a Lagrange scalar density, L, will be required to have units (~7,
since the integral of L over a four-volume must have units of action ~¢?.
