Tue earliest attempt to subject the Theory of the Tides to a rigorous dynamical
treatment was given by Lapiace in the first and fourth books of the ‘ Mécanique
Céleste.’ The subject has since been treated by Arry,* Ketvin,t Darwin,t Lame,§
and other writers, but with the exception of the extension of LApLacer’s results to
include the theory of the long-period tides, but little practical advance has been made
with the subject, in spite of the enormous increase in the power of the mathematical
resources at our disposal, and tle problem has remained in very much the same
condition as it was left by Lartace. This arises no doubt partly from the difficulties
inherent to the subject, but partly from the form in which the theory was originally
presented by Lapxace in the ‘ Mécanique Céleste,’ which has been described by Atry
as “perhaps on the whole more obscure than any other part of the same extent in
that work.” The obscurity complained of does not however seem to have been
entirely removed by Lapiacr’s successors, and it was the fact that every presentment
of the theory with which I was acquainted offered some points of difficulty, that in
the first instance led me to take up the problem ab initio, partly with the purpose of
allaying the doubts which had arisen in my own mind as to the validity of certain
approximations employed by Lariace and adopted by his successors, and partly in
the hope that I might be able to extend the results of Lartace to meet more fully
the case presented by the circumstances actually existent in Nature.
Up to the present I have been unable to free the problem to any extent from the
limitations which have been imposed by previous writers, and consequently it would
be futile to claim that the results I am now able to put forward materially advance
