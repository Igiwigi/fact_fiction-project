The critical point

Figure 2 shows that depending on (v,€), or equivalently (i, €), the branch of the dispersion curve
extending upwards from ({29,0) may tilt backwards up to a critical point marked with a cross,
where d.2/dK =0, beyond which it slopes forward. This point will be denoted (2c, Kc), where 2
is the critical frequency and K, is the critical wavenumber. To determine their values, we use the
fact that Ke is a root of d(2?)/d(K?) =0, regarded as an equation in K*, and from (2.15) we have

Here, primes denote derivatives with respect to K*. This gives an expansion in powers of € of the
form
KE = Ki(D,€) = Keg) + (KE) @) + (KE) 2(0) + ---, (3.2)

where Ky and (K2)2 are even functions of i, and (K2)1 is odd. A feature of (3.2) (and most series
we use) is that it contains odd as well as even powers of €; this is a consequence of Poisson scaling,
in which 7 instead of v is used as a parameter, and terms are ordered with ) regarded as order
one.


(a) Calculation of the critical wavenumber

On substituting the series form of K? into (3.1), and equating coefficients of successive powers of
€ to zero, we obtain

(1 — K2,)°(1 — 2K%) = 5? (3.3)

and a somewhat longer expression for (K2)2.
