It is thus sufficient in the case of sound-waves of ordinary
intensity to consider the propagation of a simple wave, as discussed in equations (3)
to (10). The relative harmonic constituents of the complex wave preserve their
relative amplitudes unaltered during propagation ; in other words, the quality of the
sound is propagated to a distance without change. This fact is well illustrated by
the everyday experience that the various notes from a number of musical instruments
played simultaneously can be individually recognized over long distances. These
points are emphasized,because, as will be seen later, they no longer remain true in the
case of waves of very great amplitude such as those emitted by a powerful fog siren. It may be mentioned in passing that sound-waves of ordinary intensity are
propagated with extremely little dissipation of energy due to viscosity or heat-
conduction, the calculations having been carried out by StoKEs* as long ago as 1845;
here again the circumstances are different in the case of very intense waves, the
experiments to be discussed in the sequel indicating that sound-waves of sufficient
power to be audible at great distances can only be generated at the expense of heavy
atmospheric losses, especially in the immediate neighbourhood of the generator.
