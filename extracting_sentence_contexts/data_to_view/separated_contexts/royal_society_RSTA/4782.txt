The influence of super-string theory, without which the application of twistor
geometry to amplitudes would not have made progress, has already been noted. Another parallel
development is the reformulation of twistor Lagrangians, or action principles. Penrose [5] had
in fact derived the early twistor diagrams from a consideration of twistor Hamiltonians. The
Witten twistor-string model stimulated a revival of this approach, notably by Lionel Mason
and collaborators. This work has been able to draw on and extend the vast body of work in
algebraic geometry built up between 1970 and 2000 to explore the twistor representation.
