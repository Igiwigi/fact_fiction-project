We have seen that the Frog possesses three kinds of wandering cells. Of the
the eosinophile cells are never phagocytic, the hyaline cells, on the other hand, an
so. If, therefore, the usefulness of “ positive chemotaxis” in the battle again:
micro-organisms lies solely in the fact that thereby phagocytes are attracted,
hyaline cells should be the ones to appear on the battle-field. We found, however
that the cells which first collect in greatest number (or are attracted) are the eosine
phile ones, and that it is not until some time has elapsed that the hyaline ce
become evident. On injecting a fresh culture of anthrax bacilli into the subcutaneous tissue of a
pithed Frog, and keeping it at the ordinary temperature, which was 12° C. at the
time these experiments were performed, and removing drops of lymph with a capilla:
pipette at intervals of half an hour, it was noticed that the leucocytes which firs
appeared were the eosinophile ones.
