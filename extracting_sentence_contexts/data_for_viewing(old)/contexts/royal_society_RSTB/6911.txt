Although these arguments of Dean and the Sollases amount to very little, there are
certain very striking Elasmobranch features in Palaeospondylus. The shape of the tail is
not unlike that of certain living sharks, and distally bifurcating radials are also not
uncommon in this group (e.g. Lamna). Furthermore, the tail fins of many early
Selachians e.g. Ctenacanthus (Moy-Thomas 1938) are supported by radials. Hollow
ring-like centra are found as early as the Lower Carboniferous, e.g. Chondrenchelys
(Moy-Thomas 1938); the presence of haemal ribs, and neural arches which start low
anteriorly and become pointed towards the tail, are also typical of many modern
Selachians. The position of the pelvic fins is also not inconsistent with Elasmobranch
affinity, neither is the general shape of the neurocranium, the large rostral elements
and the dorso-ventral compression of the anterior end of the fish. To these characters
may also be added the fact that the hyomandibular plays no part in the Holocephali
in the suspension of the jaws, the skull being autostylic and the dentition crushing.

On the other hand it is not till the Upper Devonian that primitive Elasmobranchs
appear, and it is very significant that many of the features of Palaeospondylus are like
modern and not primitive Elasmobranchs. Also it is difficult to reconcile a structure like
the ‘tauidion’ with any in Elasmobranchs as at present defined, and Elasmobranch
cartilage when calcified presents a very characteristic appearance.

(g) Placodermi

Modern researches on fossil fishes have shown that the Placodermi are a very large
and varied group, including the Acanthodii, Antiarchi, Arthrodira, Macropetalich-
