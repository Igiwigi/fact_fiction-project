The immediate increase in transpiration, which follows the loosening of the vice,
is difficult to understand; it may be the simple physical result of increased water
supply, but it may, of course, be due to the stomata opening. The converse action,
ae., the tightening the vice, produces no immediate check, and this points to the
diminution of transpiration ultimately produced being due to closure of the stomata
rather than to its being a simple physical consequence of diminished water supply.
The fact that the leaves of aquatic plants (whose stomata do not readily close)
continue to transpire vigorously after being severed from the plant, shows that
absolute cessation of water supply does not necessarily produce any rapid diminution
in transpiration. The following experiments show the gradual effect of compression.

JANUARY 26, 1898.—Dedalacanthus nervosus.

At 12.6 vice applied and produced a clear increase in the hygroscope reading.
The vice was left on, and in the afternoon the following readings were taken.
