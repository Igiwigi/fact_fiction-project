But I do nevertheless think that it gives quite
a useful feel for the distribution of citations with academic achievement. Older researchers suffer
a bit because WOS only started a systematic scan of journals in 1975, though a few papers before
that date do appear in their lists (possibly because they are still being heavily cited after that time). This is offset by the fact that younger researchers are only half way through their writing days! To overcome the strong variations between subjects that I have mentioned, the interested
reader could easily construct a version of my table relating specifically to his or her own subject,
using WOS data for known individuals.

(d) Some starting research profiles

Finally, it seems appropriate to have a look at sample profiles for papers and citations of some
researchers covering the first 8 years following the award of their PhD degrees. Four such profiles
are shown in figure 14.
