It suffices to consider that the immune cell
intrinsic cytotoxicity, represented by the parameter 6y,, depends on the tumour cell.

(b) Low recruitment scenario

We now evaluate the impact of the recruitment of immune cells to the domain of the tumour. For this purpose, we reduce the value of @;eÂ¢ from 1 to 0.35. Our interest in this parameter is
due to the fact that, on many occasions, the recruitment of cells to the site of the tumour might
be very complicated. The recruitment of immune cells is a very complex process, at least from a
physical point of view. The extravasation of leucocytes requires an initial contact between these
