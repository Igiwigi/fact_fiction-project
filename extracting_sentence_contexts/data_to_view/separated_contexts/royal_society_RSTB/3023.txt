the depressor substance is overpowered by the pressor, while with subsequent
injections these conditions are generally reversed, although the depression which is
the most marked phenomenon of the second and subsequent doses may be succeeded
by a slight and gradual rise of pressure. The facts relating to the heart and blood-
vessels recorded by the before-mentioned observers have been also observed in our
experiments. We have not found the cardiac inhibition to be a constant phenomenon ;*
sometimes it is absent altogether with the doses of pituitary which we have employed,
and often it is so slight as almost to escape observation. Most commonly it does not
come on at the same moment as the rise in blood-pressure, but its advent may
be delayed for some seconds or even for a minute or more ; it is frequently preceded
by a period of cardiac acceleration.
