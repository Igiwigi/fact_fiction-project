e Doubts as to the reliability of computer-aided proofs. The first such instance that resulted
in a huge hype, and subsequent vehement discussion, was the initial solution of the
four colour problem, that was later found to be fallacious. Later such similar doubts,
sometimes in even more exaggerated forms, were expressed in connection with all other
prominent results, whose proofs relied on extensive computer calculations and/or case
analysis, including the remarkable Hales’ solution of Kepler’s problem.

e Doubts as to the reliability of particularly long and complicated proofs. The most
notorious and disputed example of such a highly complex proof is of course the
Classification of Finite Simple Groups, whose published proof amounts, according to
the most conservative estimate, to some 15000 pages. It is essentially the proof of the
theorem itself, that further relies on scores of subsidiary facts on finite groups and their
representations, algebraic groups, finite geometries, etc. However, the same question
naturally arises in connection with any sufficiently advanced result, whose formidable
proof takes a few hundred pages of tough, tightly knit and highly specialized arguments,
that in turn rely on oodles of previous difficult results.


In these circumstances, ignorant popularisers and journalists started to speak about ‘loss of
certainty’ and even ‘death of proof’. However, for the reasons I’m going to sketch in this article,
lam inclined to believe that the status of all results mentioned above—and of their proofs!—is not
significantly different from the status of deep mathematical results of previous centuries. In fact,
I am ready to contend that mathematical proofs never—from the times of Greeks!—satisfied the
declared standards. The claim of Bourbaki is utterly wrong in all of its parts, and, in particular,
