into the systemic arch. This vestigeal vessel, whose significance has been pointed
out previously (60), is present in an equally developed condition on both sides.

A. Arteria laryngeo-trachealis (Laryngeal artery, VAN BEMMELEN) (text-fig. 6).â€”
This interesting vessel arises from the pulmonary arch a short distance from
the heart. It was overlooked by RarHKE(66), who examined Sphenodon,
but it was noted by vAN BeMMELEN (10), who also claims to have found it in
Platydactylus, Lacerta, Anguis, Pseudopus, and Iguana. In company with
the laryngeal nerves and the tracheal vein, it passes up the side of the
trachea, to which it sends small twigs, finally breaking up in the larynx. It
gives off a number of branches (I-VI).

The interest of this vessel lies in the fact that it is undoubtedly homologous with
the arteria cesophagea of Triton, Salamandra, and Spelerpes as described by
Bernee(11). In these Urodela the respiration is carried on not only by the skin
and lungs, but also by the mucosa of the buccal cavity and pharynx. Indeed, in
Speleropes, where the lungs have been completely suppressed, it is performed entirely
by the skin and the mucosa in these regions. We find as a result in this form that
the pulmonary artery has disappeared, and the only branch of the pulmonary arch

. that remains is the very large cesophageal artery, which ramifies over the whole of
the pharynx, cesophagus, and even the stomach. This relic of what is an important
vessel in the Urodele Amphibia persists in certain Lacertilia as noted above, but
appears to be best developed in Sphenodon.
