The readings obtained when the sphere is down form a series of points on a curve
of which the vertical height above the initial horizontal part of the trace is a measure
of the integrated ionization current which has entered the sphere from the atmosphere.
This curve forms the zero line for potential gradient, «e., the differences of the
ordinates of this curve and of the actual trace obtained when the sphere is exposed
give a measure of the potential gradient at any moment.

In fig. 2 is reproduced the record of May 12, 1917, from 16h. 50m, to 17h. 35m.
The sky was overcast and the weather conditions suggested thunder—a storm did in
fact occur some hours later. The sphere was momentarily raised at 16h. 51m. ; raised
again at 16h. 55m., and kept up till 17h. 23m., being however momentarily lowered
into its case at 5-minute intervals during this time; it was kept in its case after
17h. 23m. The potential gradient was 150 volts per metre at 16h. 51m. ; it gradually
diminished till it reached negative values, and continued to be negative from
17h. 12m. 50s. till 17h. 18m. 10s., reaching a minimum of —80 volts per metre at
17h. 16m., becoming positive again and being equal to 260 volts per metre when the
sphere was lowered at 17h. 23m. The negative potential gradient coincided in time
with the passage overhead of a cloud discharging rain which did not reach the ground.
The test-plate was uncovered from 17h, 25m. to 17h. 30m.: the displacement of the
meniscus on uncovering and covering the plate is almost too small to be seen in
the reproduction of the record but indicates the continuance of a positive potential
gradient of about 300 volts per metre. The ionization current from the earth-
