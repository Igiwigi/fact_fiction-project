£ = displacement at measuring end of bar;
¢, = extension of bar under static load; ¢’ = time; 7/2 = time taken by a wave of velocity ¢ to travel
the length of the bar. Before discussing these results, it will be convenient to consider how far they are likely
to differ from those which would be given by the accurate theory of § 11 if it were possible
to derive a pulse solution using this theory. Any difference between the results will be due
to the fact that the two theories lead to different values of ¢/¢y for the same values of ¢ and a/A,
and curves (1) and (1a) in figure 13 indicate that the difference in ¢/cy is small for small
values of a/A and that it increases as a/A increases. Considering the nth term in the infinite
series of equation (12-14), A = 2l/n and a/A = na/2l; a/2l is equal to 0-003280 for bar A
and 0-001421 for bar B.



STUDY OF THE HOPKINSON PRESSURE BAR 435

For bar A, table 12-3 gives (i) the amplitude (—1)"/n?(1-+-n?y2) of the vibration repre-
sented by the nth term (x = 1,10, ...,90) in the infinite series of equation (12-14) (ii) the
value of a/A for the wave concerned in this vibration, (iii) the value of c/cy acsanding to
equation (12-5), (iv) the value of c/c) according to the accurate theory, (v) the ratio of the
two values of ¢/¢y. 0-25 T T =
