ed anticipate that the bony frame-work, which is the chief storehouse of mineral
er, would develop proportionally much less in the fattening Pig, than in either

the analysis of two animals alone, that there would frequently be an actual reduction of
F e total mineral matter of the body, during the fattening period.
