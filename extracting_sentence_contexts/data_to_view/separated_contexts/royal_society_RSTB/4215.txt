No attempt has been made to examine
all the existing periods. In all these cases the amplitude of one particular period so
greatly exceeds the amplitude of any other that this special period must be considered
predominant. When the statistics of these different localities are examined, it is found that in
nearly every case a different epidemic periodicity exists, a fact that must be con-
sidered of fundamental importance. The shortest period found is that existing in
Paris during the last 30 years, which is accurately, or almost accurately, that of the
solar year. No other period has been discovered to exist in these statistics.
