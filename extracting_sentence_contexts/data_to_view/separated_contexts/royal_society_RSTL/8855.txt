W. K. PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT

Tn the presence of such curious facts as the skulls of larval Caducibranchs discloge,
the mind naturally seeks to know what have been the factors in that marvellous modifi-
cation of the axis seen in the 8kull of a Vertebrate animal. I shall reconsider these

things in my © Summary.”
The auditory capsules of the larval Seironota (Plate 29. figs. 1, 2) are thoroughly

chondrified, and well show the form of the enclosed membranous labyrinth, with its
three canals above (fig. 1, 9.8.0., h.8.0., P-8.c.), and the crescentic slit, becoming the
ſenestra ovyalis (fig. 2, f.0.), below. Mesiad of this oblique rent in the capsule the ragged and imperfect cartilage has

X not yet formed itself into a stapes.
