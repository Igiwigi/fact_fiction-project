There would be no difficulty in this
reduction, if we could: give in terms of the intensity of any
magnet the increment or decrement of intensity correspond-
ing to a certain decrement or increment of temperature at all
temperatures. To determine this accurately, would however
require a great variety of experiments to be made with
magnets of very different intensities ; but as I have not made
these, I must- content myself for the present with pointing
out some of the facts-which I have ascertained from more
extended experiments than those I have already given, re-
serving the detail of these experiments for another oppor-
tunity, should they be deemed of sufficient interest. These experiments were made with a balance of torsion,
the needle being 'suspended by a brass wire 4; inch in
diameter : by them I ascertained the following facts :

1. Commencing with a temperature — 9? FAHRENHEIT, up
to a temperature 127?, as the temperature of the magnets
increased, their intensity decreased. Owing to the almost
total absence of snow during the winter, I was unable to re-
duce lower the temperature of the large magnets which I
made use of; but from an experiment I made at the Royal
Institution, in conjunction with Mr. Farapay, in which a
small magnet, enveloped in lint well moistened with sul-
phuret of carbon, was placed on the edges of a basin con-
taining sulphuric acid, under the receiver of an air pump, I
found that the intensity of the magnet increased to the lowest
point to which the temperature was reduced, and that the
intensity decreased on the admission of air into the receiver,
and consequent increase of temperature in the magnet, This


the intensity of magnetic forces, &c. 6g

is in direct contradiction to the notion which has been enter-
tained of destroying the magnetism of the needle by the ap-
plication of intense cold.
