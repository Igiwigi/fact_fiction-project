If f is
proximable, then the linearized ADMM method [30] can be used; available as LADMM in CIL. If the
so-called convex conjugate, f*, of f is proximable, then the primal dual hybrid gradient (PDHG)
method [31-33], also known as the Chambolle-Pock method, may be used; this is known as PDHG
in CIL. In fact, an even wider class of problems can be handled using this formulation, namely

u* =arg min | Yo fi(Kiu) + «| , (3.13)

Figure 7. PDHG reconstruction of 15-projection three-dimensional steel-wire dataset. (a,b) TV-regularization with a = 0.02,
reproduces the same result as FISTA in figure 6 on the same case and parameter choice, thus validating algorithms against each
other. Colour range [—0.01, 0.11]. (c) Objective value histories (log-log) for FISTA and PDHG on TV-regularization problem.
