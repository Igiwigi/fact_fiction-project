hours, raw wool obtained its lowest readings long before flax ; and the readings
on wool, on the approach of a cloud, increased much sooner than those on flax ; and
in consequence of the latter circumstance, the mean values deduced from raw wool
and flax were nearly the same. In intervals of clear sky, between cloudy states of
it, the difference between the readings of two thermometers, the one in air and the
other on raw wool, was the greatest of any of the differences. "he rapidity of the
decrease of the readings on raw wool from a cloudy to a clear sky was about a degree
per minute, 80 that a change in the readings of 15 has taken place in a quarter of an
hour. The greatest difference between the temperature of a body at night on the
surface of the earth, and that of air a few feet above the earth, was 28*5 ; this extra-
ordinary difference occurred in 1844, April $4, at 8* (See Table XLIV.). The times

* Thus explaining the fact frequently noticed by sportsmen, that the snow upon which hares have been
lying is never in the slightest degree melted.

at which other large differences took place, with their amounts, will be seen in
Section II.

The next class of bodies consisted of black and white wadding, flannel, and wool of
different kinds and colours. Of these, black and white wadding exhibited the lowest
readings, and were nearly equal in amount; flannel was the next in order, and the
