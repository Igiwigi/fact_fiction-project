along with others, were unfortunately lost.


TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY ON XENOPSYLLA 593

in X. brasiliensis and X. cheopis; though in X. astia some of the cocoons contained advanced
pupae. But within the cocoons of the three species devoid of food the development of the
larvae proceeded without any adverse effect. Apparently, then, high humidities in them-
selves do not prevent the development of stages within cocoons; but in combination with
finely powdered food, the particles of which expand and block the interspaces in their web-
bing, high humidity has resulted in death. The fact that adults emerged even from some of the
putrid cocoons of X. astia at 97-5 % R.H., shows that as long as the access of air into cocoons
was possible the growth of the larvae and the pupae within proceeded.

The presence or absence of food in the cocoon wall did not affect the development of
stages within the cocoons of the three species (tables 26 to 28) at an optimum humidity of
90%. Similarly, at a low humidity of 60% there was no significant difference in the
development of stages within the two types of cocoons of X. astia; but in the case of
X. brasiliensis there was a significantly better growth of the larvae within cocoons containing
food, as is indicated by the formation of the advanced pupae.
