fibre axis and to each other. There is not the least doubt that the true minimum unit of
pattern is greater than these magnitudes imply; still, the smaller unit is repeated
approximately within the larger and must be the expression of some chemical grouping
which is the structural basis of the completed protein molecule. Similarly, in the 6-form,
the X-ray diffraction figure focuses our attention on a pseudo-unit defined by a trans-
lation 6-64 A.U. along the fibre axis, and translations 9-3 A.U. and 9-8 A.U. at right
angles to the fibre axis and to each other.

If we are justified in attaching any significance to these dimensions, then it ought to
be possible to link them up with the reversible transformation which exists between
the «- and 6-forms. Assuming that the density of stretched hair is not very different
from that of unstretched hair, then the volumes of the two pseudo-cells should be the
same. As a matter of fact, if the spot of spacing 4-65 A.U. which we have chosen as
(200) of the $-form be taken, instead, as (400), this relation is indeed roughly true ; for

which is sufficiently near to the 27 A.U. mentioned above, when it is recalled that the
spot of this estimated spacing is in reality spread over several Angstrom units and is too
