But that under common circumstances is not the case. With air in the receiver, the
variation amounted to 0'2 of an inch nearly on the smaller interyal of 0'6, and with
muriatic acid gas, the variation was aboye 0:4 on the smaller interval of 0:9, Why is
it that when a fixed interyal (the one in the receiver) will pass a spark that cannot
go across 0'6 of air at one time, it will immediately after, and apparently under ex-
actly similar circumstances, not pass a spark that can go across 0'8 of air?

1391. It is probable that part of this yariation will be traced to particles of dust
in the air drawn into and about the circuit. I belieye also that part depends upon a
variable charged condition of the surface of the glass vessel a. That the whole of the
effect is not traceable to the influence of circumstances in the vessel a, may be de-

* duced from the fact, that when sparks occur between balls in free air they frequently
are not straight, and often pass otherwise than by the shortest distance. These ya-
riations in air itself, and at difterent parts of the very same balls, show the presence
and influence of circumstances which are calculated to produce effects of the kind
now under consideration.

1392. When a spark had passed at either interval, then, generally, more tended to
appear at the same interval, as if a preparation had been made for the passing of the
latter sparks. So also on continuing to work the machine quickly the sparks gene-
rally followed at the same place. 'This effect is probably due in part to the warmth
of the air heated by the preceding spark, in part to dust, and I suspect in part to
something unperceived as yet in the cireumstances of discharge.
