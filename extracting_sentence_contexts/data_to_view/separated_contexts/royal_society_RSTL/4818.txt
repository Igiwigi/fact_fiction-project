This latter snupposition was originally advocated by Wac-
NER, VALENTINE and Biscyore. But two of these observers bave recently changed
their views*#, and now regard the fluid portion as only of secondary importance in
impregnation, and the spermatic bodies as of essential. This view, as WacneR
statesFF#, is founded chiefly on the fact that in some of the invertebrata the whole mass

of the semen appears to be constituted almost or entirely of spermatozoa, while
scarcely any liquor seminis can be detected ;—and further,on the great improbability,
perhaps impossibility, of the liquor seminis of those. animals which expel their ova
into water hefore impregnation being brought into contact with the oyum. - But the
same author justly remarks, that © even up to the present day this hypothesis of the
influence of the liquor seminis has not met with any direct refutation.,” To this I
may add, that however strong the presumption may be in fayour of the agency of
the spermatozoa in those instances in which a liquor seminis has not been observed,
it affords no sufficient reason for disbelieying that the spermatozoa are not resolved
into fluid at the moment of fecundation ; or that in those animals in which the liquor
seminis occurs, in abundance it is not that which impregnates the oynm.
