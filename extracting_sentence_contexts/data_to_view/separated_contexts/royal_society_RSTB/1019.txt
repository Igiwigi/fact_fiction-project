To the posterior aspect of the fore limb
four segments contribute (Ist, IInd, I[Ird, [Vth thoracic); to that of the hind
limb four segments also (VIth, VIIth, VIIIth, IXth post-thoracic). In each limb the preaxial border is segmentally more extensive than the postaxial. I have shown that this last fact is exemplified even more strikingly in the museula-
ture of the limb, both fore limb and hind limb. The quadrifid or quinquifid digital partition of the free end of the limb is no ~
indication of the number of segmental skin fields in the limb. The distribution of the fibres of the sensory spinal root in the limb, as elsewhere,
indicates a segmental significance in their constitution rather than a functional based
on co-ordination.
