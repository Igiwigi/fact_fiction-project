In some cases, the energetic consequences of these details can be addressed analytically. In others, simulation must be used, as details of particle and interface area together determine the :
interaction. The fact that the near-field interactions occur, and play a strong role in the structures 18
that form, allows particle shape and wetting conditions to be used to tailor aggregate properties :
including their symmetries, the strengths of the assemblies and the equilibrium separation :=
distances between the particles. 38

(b) Microparticles on curved interfaces: experiment R

We have developed a technique to define interface curvature in settings suitable for optical as)
microscopy. A curved oilâ€”water interface is formed around a micropost of height Hm and :B
radius Rm. Far from the micropost is a confining ring, located several capillary lengths from the :8
micropost centre.
