Such a hypo-
esis looks like explaining one wether by means of a new one, but it is perhaps not
ally more complicated than the facts ; on our present principle of interpretation, the
hange of gravitation in the field due to a disturbance at any point must have been
propagated somehow, while in the machinery that transmits electric and luminiterous
isturbances no elasticity has yet been recognized anywhere near intense enough to
‘ake part in such a propagation.

_ We may not surmount the difficulty by the assumption that, in addition to the
finite resistance to rotation which is the cause of the propagation of the radiation, the
medium also possesses an enormously greater static resistance to rotations of some
more fine-grained structure, and that the surface integral of the rotation over any
surface enclosing a vortex-atom is a positive constant, of course definite and unchange-
able in value for each atom ; for this would lead to gravitational repulsion instead of
attraction. The term must be in the kinetic energy, not in the potential energy of

he medium,

104. In a representation of a magnetic or other medium,* imagined to be composed
of gyrostatic elements spinning indifferently in all directions, and linked into a
system by an arrangement like idle-wheels between them, in fact by an ideal system
universal ball-bearings, the kinetic energy function would have a rotatory part

here (f, g, 4) is the absolute rotation of an element, which is supposed from the
connecting mechanism to be a continuous function of position in the system. We would have therefore

Thus the kinetic foreive which is the equivalent of the actual applied foreive in the
medium per unit volume, arising from its potential energy and such extraneous forces
s act on it, is
