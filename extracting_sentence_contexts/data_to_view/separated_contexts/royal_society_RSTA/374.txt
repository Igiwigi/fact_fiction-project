The location of Bangladesh at the head of the Bay of Bengal also makes it
especially susceptible to land-falling tropical cyclones during the boreal spring
and autumn. Most loss of life and damage is associated with wind-driven storm
surges that often inundate areas of tens of kilometres of the flat delta. In fact,
the Bay of Bengal is home to 7 of the 10 most deadly tropical cyclones in
recorded history. This paper provides two examples from the South Asia region whereby
anticipation of extreme events through probabilistic weather and climate forecasts
could enable a user group to minimize their adverse impacts. Two different time
scales are considered: the time scale of days to weeks, with regard to a specific
impending extreme event; and the time scale of decades, with regard to the
changing statistics of extreme events that may attend climate change.
