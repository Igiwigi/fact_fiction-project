At the time the discovery was made, viz. the
autumn of 1932, he was unaware that a somewhat similar phenomenon had been
described by Thung (1931). In an investigation on the nature of viruses and the
distribution of two or more infecting a plant simultaneously, Thung developed the
theory that one virus present in a cell might exert an antagonistic action against a
second invading virus so that the latter is refused entrance by the cell. In a paragraph
of which the following is a translation from the original Dutch sanctioned by himself,
Thung states: “That this is indeed the fact is shown when the virus of the common
mosaic (of tobacco) is inoculated into a plant (tobacco) already suffering from white
mosaic and the symptoms of the common mosaic fail to appear. Inoculations with the
sap of the twice infected plant reproduce only the white mosaic in healthy individuals,
showing that the virus of the common type is not present, even in a latent condition. Similarly, plants affected by common mosaic fail to develop the white type on inocula-
tion.
