host was associated with just one single nucleotide poly-

This opportunistic bacterial pathogen of humans lives as a of the CC97 strain from livestock into humans. In fact, phylo-

increased in frequency in the past decade [41]. Staphylococcus increased over 10-fold during 5 years in Denmark [46].

this bacterium has a smaller than average genome and a high substitution [55], both of which may have driven rapid host | 5 |
