nitudes were simply related amongst themselves in the case of non-associated liquids,
deviations from such regularities would be exhibited by complex liquids, and these
deviations would give some indication of the existence and extent of the molecular

grouping. A. Comparisons or Viscosity Macnivepms av ran BorLina-Pour. Following the suggestion of Scuréper and Kopp, the temperature of the ordinary
boiling-point has been largely used in the comparison of the physical constants of
liquids ; at this temperature the vapour pressures of the substances ave, of course, the
