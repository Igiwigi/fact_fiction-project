digyna is recorded by Jessen (1938) from Zone III at Ballybetagh; its present distribution
is markedly Arctic-Alpine. Its appearance here at the top of Zone II, accompanied by
Polytrichum alpinum, a mountain and moorland species, together with the fact that here the
N.T.P./T.P. ratio again becomes high, suggests that this 2 to 5 cm. of grey clay was deposited
under conditions colder than the preceding, when the climate was again becoming severe. The grey clay is everywhere overlain by horizontally bedded laminated clay (Zone III),
showing that there were again glaciers in the drainage basin. Correlation of this late-glacial detritus silt with the Allerad layer of north-western Europe which has
been recognized in Ireland.
