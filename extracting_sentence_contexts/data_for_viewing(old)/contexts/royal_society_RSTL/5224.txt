IN THE LARGER MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES, 171

Cape of Good Hope. On the average of the year the easterly is decidedly a smaller
disturbance than the westerly.. The same fact is shown from the Hobarton observa-
tions. At [that _ station the easterly disturbance is smaller than the westerly in
eleven months of the, year, the average annual easterly disturbance being consider-
ably less than-the weeterly.- At Toronto also we find the same fact occurring; the
value of a disturbed easterly observation is less than a westerly on the average of
the year; the difference is however in this case inconsiderable, and there are Several
discrepancies in the different months.

Next, distributing the disturbances into the several hours of their occurrence, the
following table is obtained. The facts, besides being very remarkable when viewed
alone, acquire 80 much additional interest when exhibited in contrast with the law
which bas already. been shown. to prevail at Toronto and Hobarton, that I have
placed the corresponding tables of the ratios at Toronto and Hobarton beside those
of St. Helena and the Cape for the sake of more convenient comparison.
