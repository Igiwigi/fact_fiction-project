By a theorem of Iemhoff ({10], Theorem 3.9), this means
that A Hpc B, where Hpc denotes the derivability relation of IPC extended with all of Visser's
rules. In other words, there is a proof tree, potentially using A as a premise, all steps in which
are instances of the rules of IPC and V, and whose conclusion is B. Given that Visser’s rules are
admissible in T, and using the fact that T is based on intuitionistic logic, it is straightforward

to see that every rule application in the proof tree is admissible in T. Hence, B is an admissible 2S
consequence of A, A l~r B. r :3

The two theorems give two routes to proving that the propositional admissible rules of a theory
T are exactly those of IPC.
