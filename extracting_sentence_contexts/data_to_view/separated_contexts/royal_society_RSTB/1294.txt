Intermediate forms, it was stated, do not occur. Although the superficial markings
are alike in the two forms, they had hitherto been reckoned as distinct species. Relying on the fact that only large examples of the forms with small central
chambers had been found, Munrer-Cuanmas concluded that each species consisted of
two sets of individuals; first, those with a large central chamber, which attained a_
small size, and whose development was arrested at this stage ; second, those in which ]
the size was increased by the addition of chambers at the end of the spiral, while the
large central chamber was replaced by a prolongation of the spire of chambers to the
centre of the shell. MR. J.
