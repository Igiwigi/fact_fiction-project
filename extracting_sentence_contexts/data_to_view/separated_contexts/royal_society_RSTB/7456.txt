During this last trapping not a single bait was disturbed. It is thus
obvious that there was a difference in the mortality rates before and after February. From a more detailed analysis, however, it seems probable that the change occurred
earlier (Appendix 2); and evidence from the estimated and observed minimum survival
rates is that the death-rate accelerated rapidly from January onwards (table 17).

(iii) Discussion

The main facts about the population on block Q are as follows (figure 4). At the start
of the winter 1936-7 there were about 300 animals; 120 to 130 were left by May 1937,
and their death-rate probably increased from then onwards. Young born in May and
June died rapidly and adults formed a fairly high proportion of the August population;
numbers seemed little greater then than in the spring. (Table 1 and figure 4 show that the
summer population of 1933 was also stationary.) The rate of juvenile survival now im-
proved, and by September numbers were about what they had been a year before.
