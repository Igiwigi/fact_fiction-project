The first stage of the Bayesian modelling framework is to explicitly state all assumptions using
the language of probability theory. Specifying both the prior and likelihood is a necessary
requirement so that the model is well defined. In fact, the distinction between prior and likelihood
is arbitrary?; both are essential parts of the model. People also object to the use of priors on the parameters on the grounds that they do not
think of the parameters as being ‘random’ variables. For example, if one is estimating the mass
of a planet from astronomical data, the mass of the planet is not ‘random’ in the colloquial
sense of the word.’ This is a misunderstanding of the semantics of probabilities in Bayesian

2Of course, our model may have a fixed value of 0, e.g. 7.213, which corresponds to a delta function prior.

3Consider, for example, a model that defines the probability of the data (ie. the likelihood) using a student f-distribution.
