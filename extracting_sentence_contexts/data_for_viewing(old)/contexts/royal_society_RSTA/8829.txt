Hence, since any system is built up of combinations of lenses or single refracting
surfaces, we find that E is a sextic polynomial in M for any system.

Examination of particular cases shows that E is not, in general, divisible by A, so
that the vanishing of the latter does not usually involve the disappearance of the
second order terms.

$9. Invariant Relations.

Certain relations exist between the coeflicients A, B, C, E which remain the same
in form, whatever the number of refracting surfaces. One of these we have already

dealt with, namely the fact that
A-—MB

reduces to an éxpression of the third degree, 7.c., the coeflicients of highest degree in
M in A and B are the same.

This we shall refer to as the fist invariant relation (I.).

A second invariant relation takes the form

B-C=$(1-M)+4dA/dM,. . . ... . . (ll)
