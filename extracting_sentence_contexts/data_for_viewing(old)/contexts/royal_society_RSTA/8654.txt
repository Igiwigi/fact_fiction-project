of free convection from the grid, but is more nearly the component of the free convection
along the axis of the microphone. ‘That is, V, is approximately equal to V cos 9,
V being the velocity of free convection from the grid. If this were strictly true, we

should have V, = 0 when 6 = a but this is not generally the case, probably owing

to the fact that the loops are slightly displaced and do not lie in a plane which is just
at right angles to the microphone axis, and it may even happen that they are not all
in the same plane. For example, in the case of the grid used in the experiment just
described, it was found that :

V, = 1°225 ems. per second when @ = 0,
and

V, = 0°25 cm. per second when 6 = =

As an approximation we may take V = 1°225 and V, = Vcos(@+a@) when @ is

near = so that
