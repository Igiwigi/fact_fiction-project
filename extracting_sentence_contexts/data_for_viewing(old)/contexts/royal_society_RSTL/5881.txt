imperfectly acrated, having only flowed through the pallial membranes, which must be
looked upon as but accessory oxygenating agents. The arms undoubtedly perform the
office of gills, and are true respiratory organs. 'The blood which circulates through
them will consequently be returned in a perfectly atrated condition, to be mixed, how-
ever, with that in a less pure state from the visceral lacunes before it enters the heart.
"This mixed state of the blood is not by any means peculiar to these animals, for it
obtains in many of even the higher mollusks.

To prove that the brachial organs subserve the function of gills, as well as that of
5 sustentation, it is only necessary to refer to the manner in which the blood circles round
; the arms and is carried to the cirri; but more particularly to its circulating through
Z these latter organs, and to its return direct from them to the heart. There can be no
22 doubt that the cirri are provided with vibratile cilia, and indeed this fact seems to be
established by the observations of Mr. BanrerT! ; and a considerable portion of their
S extremities is snficiently delicate to admit of the blood being aGrated through their
walls. The inner lamina of the mantle, and more particularly that portion of it form-
= ing the floor of the great pallial sinuses, will undoubtedly assist in purifying the blood ;

but like the mantle of many of the Nudibranchs, it can only play a secondary part.
> This may fairly be inferred from the distribution of the blood-channels within the
lamina. In T. caput-serpentis?, however, this portion of the mantle is 80 filled with
calcareous spicula, that in this instance it must, even in this secondary capacity, have
its efficiency much impaired ; and in Megerlia truncata* the floor or inner wall of the
trunks of the great sinuses is completely filled with spicula to such an extent, that the
membrane seems entirely displaced.
