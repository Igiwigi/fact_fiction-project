connective tissue arches are not seen because they are at a different level. The roof
of the neural arch is not formed by the direct junction of the two sides of the arch, but,
as we have already seen, by the supradorsal. This piece carries projections on its sides
where the basidorsals meet it ; these projections form a shelf-like structure, which ean
be found even in the adult skeleton.

The origin of the dorsal (neural) spine in Urodela has not been dealt with by any
previous worker ; it has been tacitly assumed that it is formed from a mid-dorsal union
of the basidorsals. What actually happens is that it originates from the mid-dorsal
roofing of the connective tissue arch. The supradorsal forms only a curved wall at the
posterior end of the vertebra.

The most striking fact described in this paper, which has not been recorded by any
previous worker, is that part of the dorsal arcualia, Â¢.e., except the supradorsal, degenerates.
The degeneration does not take place in the basidorsal as a whole, but cartilaginous
cells together with the inner perichondrial layer degenerate, leaving behind the outer
perichondrial layer which is converted into bone.

If we go through the series of transverse sections of a degenerated basidorsal we find,
first, the outer perichondrium, beyond which there is the connective tissue to complete
the arch, and the differences of these two tissues can very easily be detected. The
thickness of the upper (or roofing) connective tissue is much greater than that of the
outer perichondrial layer of the degenerated basidorsal. A transverse section posterior
to this region shows that, instead of the connective tissue roofing the space between two
degenerated basidorsals, we get the supradorsal, which retains its cartilage cells, together
