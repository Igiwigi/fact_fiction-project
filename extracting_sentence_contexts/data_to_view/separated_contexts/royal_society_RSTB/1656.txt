F. GOTCH AND G. J. BURCH ON THE

Class 4, of which fig. 3 (d) is an example, comprises three cases in which the effect
comprised a prolonged muscular tetanus, and as it is difficult to judge how far this is
due to an intense peripheral organ rhythm mixed up with a succession of responses to
central reflex nerve discharge, they throw little light on the present question. In
the figure it appears probable that the final tetanus is due to the peripheral rhythm. The observations thus appear to show that the organ can respond reflexly to both
mechanical and electrical stimulation of its skin, and that such a response differs from
the direct one, first, in its longer period of delay, and secondly in the fact that it can
be renewed at variable intervals, the minimum time between such a renewed outburst
and its predecessor being, as far as this method can determine it, j'; second. It
appeared, moreover, that this renewal of the organ response is one which the fish is
able to bring about with the rapid frequency of twelve per second only a very few
times, so that with a repetition or prolongation of the skin stimulus in the vast
majority of cases the response is renewed two or three times, at intervals of } to
3 second, then fails to be renewed again after about 1 second. In fig. 3 (e) is the
rheoscopic record of the organ response produced by such a prolonged skin pressure ;
there are evidently four or five groups of such responses, the last but one consisting
of three contractions at intervals of +45 second; the whole comprises members of all
the above Classes 2, 3, and 4, and lasts nearly 4 seconds.
