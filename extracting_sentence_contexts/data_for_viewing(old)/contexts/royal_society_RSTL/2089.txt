planet. I saw not the slightest projection of the star upon the planet's disk.

Again, at the emersion, which happened at 4" 50” 41*7, the star with the
large equatorial telescope was seen neatly dichotomised ; with the large finder
it was detected before the planet's disk had separated from it ; by the five feet
Equatorial, when it was still clinging to it; and by the small finder when it was
not more than three seconds distant. With the large telescope it was watched
with the greatest attention, at, and for some time subsequent to the emersion ;
and I feel confident that not anything remarkable occurred, any more than at
and previously to the immersion. The planet had passed his opposition nine
days.

Reflecting on these facts and on those I have before presented to your RovyaL
Hicnness, I can arrive at no other conclusion than that either some physical
change has occurred in the © Extensive Atmosphere of Mars,” or that the accu-
'racy of the observations of Cassint and of Rotmer must be regarded as un-
tenable.
