acid found in the Trifolium repens soil, together with the increased amount lost by
drainage, could not have had its source entirely in the nitrification of recent nitro-
genous crop-residue. Some of the increased amount in the lower layers was indeed
doubtless due to washing down from the surface. But as, notwithstanding much
more nitrogen had been removed in crops from the leguminous than from the
gramineous crop soil during the previous 30 years, the surface soil of the leeuminous
plots remained slightly richer in nitrogen than that of the gramineous plot, it cannot
be supposed that the whole of the nitrogen of the crop, and of the nitric acid found,
had its origin in the surface soil. If, therefore, nitrogen has not been derived from
the atmosphere, the conclusion must be that some has come from the subsoil.

The indication was that nitrification had been more active under the influence of
the leguminous than of the gramineous growth and crop-residue. In fact, under the
influence of leguminous growth, not only will there be increased nitrogenous matter
for nitrification, but it would seem that the development of the nitrifying organisms
will be favoured. The question is, therefore, whether part of the result be not due
to the passage downwards of the nitrifying organisms, and the nitrification of the
nitrogen of the subsoil.

The alternative was suggested, that the soil and subsoil might still be the source of
the nitrogen of the crops, but that the plants may take up, at any rate part of their
supply, in other forms than as nitric acidâ€”as ammonia, or as organic nitrogen, for
example. It was pointed out that fungi do take up both organic carbon and organic

nitrogen; but that, whilst existing direct experimental evidence was conflicting as to
