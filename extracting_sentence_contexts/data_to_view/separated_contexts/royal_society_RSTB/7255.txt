The same condition is found in late-Glacial deposits in the
Lea Valley where calyces also occur, and in the Irish late-Glacial. The pollen may thus be referred in all probability to.A. vulgaris s.l. (Iversen), and its
presence undoubtedly indicates open conditions. Artemisia

The pollen of Artemisia, long confused with that of Salix, has been recently shown to be
in fact readily distinguishable, and many workers have now established it as an indicator
species of high value (Erdtman 1943; Iversen 1941). It has been shown to be present in
characteristically large frequencies in late-Glacial deposits and, very much later, in Neo-
lithic and post-Neolithic sediments when forest clearance by human agency had taken place
(Firbas 1948; Iversen 19472). Although we cannot say from which species the pollen was derived it seems certain that
high pollen frequencies indicate unforested areas and very likely broken or open soil.
