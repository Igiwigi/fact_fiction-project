1kHz in 2016. Comparing figure 7a,b it is visible that over time the overall sensitivity of
GEO600 was continuously improved, and that additionally the degree of squeezing within the
interferometer was increased, even though the degree of injected squeezing remained the same.
This was achieved by painstakingly reducing optical losses in the interferometer (the effect of
losses on non-classical states of light is explained in §5). While a factor of less than 3 in sensitivity
does not seem like a large improvement at first glance, it is worthwhile noting that the observable
volume of the universe scales with the cube of the sensitivity increase. Thus, even small sensitivity
improvements are pursued tenaciously.

It is obvious from the graphs in figure 7 that phase-quadrature squeezing increases the high-
frequency sensitivity of the gravitational wave detector. Maybe unexpectedly (after the treatment
in §2), it is also evident that the low-frequency sensitivity is not decreased—this is due to the
fact that technical noise still dominates the detector’s sensitivity at low frequencies, masking the
effect of quantum radiation pressure noise (which is thus not visible). It is therefore beneficial for
the overall gravitational wave detector sensitivity to inject phase-quadrature-squeezed light, as
it increases the high-frequency sensitivity, where the interferometer actually is quantum noise-
limited. This will change once the advanced gravitational wave detectors become quantum
radiation pressure noise noise-limited at low frequencies, as their design sensitivity (figure 2)
predicts.

Keep in mind, though, that by employing this technique the standard quantum limit is not
surpassed: the effect of phase-quadrature squeezing is merely as if one turned up the laser power
(but without the drawbacks associated with a power increase, e.g. larger thermal noise due to
