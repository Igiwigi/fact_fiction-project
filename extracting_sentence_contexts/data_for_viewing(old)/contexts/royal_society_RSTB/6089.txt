on its inner surface, and shows a faint vertical groove which is more marked at the
base than at the top.

Now that the milk teeth are definitely known for Paraceratherium, a correction
must be made with regard to some specimens previously described (ForsTER-CoopEr,
1915) as being the milk teeth of this form. These are not milk teeth, and are described
below as belonging to a new and different species.

Paraceratherium (?) churlandensis n. sp. Fig. 21.

The type specimens of this species are fragments of the anterior parts of the upper
and lower jaws of a young individual, were originally described as the milk teeth of
Paraceratherium bugtiense (Forster-Coorrer, 1924). Apart from the fact that the
milk dentition of this species is now fully known, the specimens appear not to be milk,
but permanent, teeth. The anterior tooth in the lower jaw, although fully out of the
gum, is absolutely untouched by wear, and is therefore unlikely to be the first premolar,
fig. 21, A. There is a small depressed area just in front of the leading tooth which may
have held the first premolar, but no trace of sockets is visible, and whether or not this
tooth was ever present is doubtful. The two teeth must be considered as the second
and third premolars, and their chief peculiarity is the great hypsodonty and, as com-
pared with those of P. bugtiense, the total absence of an external cingulum. The two
upper fragments must likewise be regarded as showing the second and third premolars.
They are of opposite sides, and although there is a small difference in pattern between
the two (Forsrer-Cooprr, 1924, fig. 17) they must, with the lower jaw fragment,
