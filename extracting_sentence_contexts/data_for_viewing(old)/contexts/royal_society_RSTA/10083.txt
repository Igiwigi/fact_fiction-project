has been examined, but reference to Table IV. shows that there is no evidence of a
periodicity connected with the orbital revolution of that planet. In fact, we may
definitely assert that no influence directly traceable to Jupiter exists.

7. It has been stated that in the absence of definite periods the expectancy of the
intensity of the periodogram must be obtained from the periodogram itself in all
cases where the events to be analysed are not, as regards their succession, independent
of each other. The expectancy not depending on the period, we may select for the
purpose any portion of the curve in which we have no reason to suspect any
periodicities. The portion most suitable for this purpose in our case is that lying
between 54 days and 1Â°5 years. Shorter periods must be avoided, because if the
length is only a few days the intensity of the periodogram is depressed, owing to the
fact that sunspots as a rule last several days. That this is so may easily be

recognised by imagining all the sunspots to have the same duration, each spot
also keeping the same area during the whole course of its life. It is obvious that
in this case the period having a length equal to the life of the spots would be
totally absent.

* A simple period is one represented by a circular function,

When we come to periods which are near to that of the solar rotation, periodicities
