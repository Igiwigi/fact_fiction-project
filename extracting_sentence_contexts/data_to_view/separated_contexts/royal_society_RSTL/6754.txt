Amongst the reults referred to in that paper, obtained by means of the instruments
and processes therein described, there was one which appeared to myself to be highly
deserving the confirmation (or otherwise) which it might receive from similar researches. By a comparison of the monthly determinations of the Dip and of the Horizontal Force at
Toronto and Hobarton, between the years 1843 and 1848, there was shown a high pro-
bability of the existence of an * annual variation” in the direction and intensity of the
magnetic force, common to both hemispheres, the mean values being passed through
about the equinoxes, and the intensity of the force being greater, and the inclination
more nearly vertical, in the months when the sun is s8outh of the equator than in the
months in which the swn is north of the equator. The facts thus made known appeared
to indicate the existence of a general affection of the globe having an annual period, and
conducting us naturally to the position of the earth in its orbit as the first consideration
towards an explanation of the periodic change. The importance of following up with-
out delay, and in the most effective manner, a branch of research which gave s0 fair a
promise of establishing a conclusion of s0 much theoretical moment upon the basis of
competent experiment was earnestly pointed out, and specially 80 with reference to those
national observatories in which magnetical researches were professed objects, and from
which exact determinations might most reasonably be expected. In 1856 the Committee of the Kew Observyatory, impressed with the importance of
prosecuting an investigation which appeared to lead to the establishment of a previously
unsuspected cosmical relation in the minor variations of texrestrial magnetigm, and
perceiving that no adequate provision had been made for this purpose in any establish-
ment in the British Islands, took the matter in hand, and having obtained permission
from the tenant under the Crown, caused a snitable wooden building, copper fastened,
to be erected in Richmond Old Deer Park, at aUistance of 300 feet from the observatory
itself, and having no other buildings in its vicinity.
