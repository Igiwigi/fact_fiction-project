line mass, resembling some of the © fossil-marbles” of our Carboniferous system, and
capable, like them, of receiving a high polish. The rock is traversed by irregular veins
of white crystalline carbonate of lime, very similar to the material that has displaced
the sarcode in the chambers and cellular portions of the shells. A piece of the lime-
stone with the fossils in situ in the Newcastle Collection (Plate LXXVIL. tig. 1) shows the
condition in which they are found. It has apparently been long exposed to the action of
weather, and is thereby a good deal roughened ; but still it shows how large a proportion
of the rock is composed of Organic Remains, chiefly those of Loftusia; and the course
which the fracture has taken, right through the fossils at whateyer angle they happened
to lie, without deviating to follow either their periphery or any of their structural lines,
indicates the determined adhesion which exists between them and the matrix. The
appearance of the specimens that have been roughly separated on the spot, testifies to
the same fact; for scarcely any of them show an exterior surface that can be regarded
as satisfactorily representing the shell during the life of the animal. The general ex-
ternal features, however, are readily made out; and we are in no worse position in re-
spect to this, than we were with the analogous genus PFusulina, which until a year or
two ago was only known from the sections of Limestone in which it occurred ; yet the
recent discovery of specimens in a free state has done little beyond confirming the accu-
racy of the conclusions previously arrived at *.

28. In shape the specimens are all oblong or oval; but they vary considerably in their
proportionate dimensions. Many of the longer ones taper almost to a point at either
extremity (Plate LXXVII. fig. 2); whilst a stouter variety (fig. 3) exhibits obtuse
