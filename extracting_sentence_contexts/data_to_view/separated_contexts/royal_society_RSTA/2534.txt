Calculating )>7_, i thus requires calculating the total number of squares in the
diagram, which is n?/2 + 1/2, by the formula for the area of a triangle plus the number of squares
supplied by the shaded half-squares, as in Chihara’s description above. As the particular number
n in the diagram remained unnoted, this holds for all n. The simplicity here seems to arise from the fact that the perception of the diagonal is immediate
and the conclusions from it are almost built into spatial perception. That is, it is the absence of
induction and its replacement with spatial thinking (or, if one prefers, the view of Plato’s heaven)
that makes the picture proof simpler. In summary, this discussion has suggested several ways in which spatial reasoning leads to
gains in simplicity: first, decreased complexity (or elimination) of notation; second, depending on the
position one takes on the triggering of an induction, either an easier-to-understand induction or an
avoidance of induction.
