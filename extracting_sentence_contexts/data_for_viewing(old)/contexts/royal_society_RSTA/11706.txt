wether, vanishing as they do over the surface of a conducting region: but the model
does not in the ordinary sense represent matter at all, except in so far as the eethereal
strain-form which constitutes the electron is associated with matter. It therefore
cannot represent directly, after the manner of a stress across a medium, a force

acting on matter, for that would from this ultimate standpoint be a force acting on a
strain-form spreading from its nucleus all through the medium, not a traction on a
detinite surface bounding the matter.

The fact is that transmission of force by a medium, or by contact action so-called,
remains merely a vague phrase until the strain-properties of that medium are
described ; the scientific method of describing them is to assign the mathematical
function which represents its energy of strain, and thence derive its relations of
stress by the principle of virtual work ; a real explanation of the transmission of a
force by contact action must be taken to mean this process. Now in an elastic
medium permeated by centres of permanent intrinsic strain, whether it be the
rotational ether with its contained electrons, or an ordinary elastic solid permeated
by polar strain-nuelei as described above, the specification of the strain-energy of the
medium involyes a mathematical function, not only of the displacement at each
material point of the medium, but also of the positions of these intrinsic strain-
centres which can move independently through it. To derive the play of internal
force, this energy function must be varied with respect to all these independent
