species for a half a billion years. The evolutionary advantage
to a species of being able to communicate more complex mean-
ings would have been (and remains) great; that is, there must
have been countless opportunities to extend unitary pre-existing
meaningful calls or gestures, but none were able to be taken.

One plausible theory about birdsong is that it was a product of
runaway sexual selectionâ€”like the male peacock tail or outsize
antlers in male deer, or huge inconvenient-looking sexual
swellings in female baboons and female chimpanzees. Elabor-
ate singing abilities seem to have been preferred by mates,
despite making little direct contribution to fitness beyond the
fact that they were preferred. Sexual selection stands in con-
trast to natural selection, which rewards improved function
like a stronger beak or more efficient wings. Certainly, a com-
plex song can serve as a sign of a mate fitter in other non-song
respects. It is a little more difficult to explain the maintenance
of extreme examples this way, especially when sexually
selected features run the risk of impeding other functions
(huge antlers) or attracting predators (elaborate vocal dis-
plays). Zahavi [63] has suggested that these handicaps have
evolved to serve as an honest signal; the feature advertises
that the animal was fit enough to overcome the handicap.
Though empirical support for the handicap model from
animal studies has been mixed, there is little doubt that
