Therefore, Bohr was a naturalist as well as a pragmatist by choice. This choice
helped him to find an interpretation of quantum mechanics at the very moment he had to face
what he took to be an epistemological lesson. The discovery of the quantum of action, Planckâ€™s
constant, was the empirical fact that forced physicists to revise classical mechanics. However,
the revision itself was constrained by classical mechanics itself, Bohr believed, because it ought
to be possible to recover the results of classical physics from quantum mechanics in those cases
where there would be no empirically discernible differences. This restriction is epitomized in his
well-known principle of correspondence.
