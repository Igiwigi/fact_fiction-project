THe SEED STALKS. In the material available, the seed stalks run nearly straight for over 30 mm.,
and as the peduncle attachment is not preserved, it is impossible to estimate how
much longer they may have been. They must have extended for some considerable
further distance, judging by the general contours of the cone, and also by the fact
that they have no indication of any change in their character such as is described
by Lienrer for the bases of the stalks, Each seed stalk is characterised by having
a small central strand and a massive, loosely packed surrounding tissue, as is
common in the genus, As was made clear by Lianrer (1894) the stalks have no
single limiting layer outside this false cortex, but are bounded by the epidermis
of adjacent interseminal scales. Lienrer described those of B. Morierei in great detail, and as the general
characters of the stalks of the species are so similar, one may accept his interpretation
of the cortex-like layer as being really a multicellular and lacunar epidermis, a
deduction he made from his study of aborted seeds.
