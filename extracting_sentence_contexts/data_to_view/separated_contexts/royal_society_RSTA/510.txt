Since

the X-ray ionic yield (7 ~3) is independent of enzyme concentration above 0:003%

weight of enzyme in solution (figure 4) we conclude that at these concentrations virtually
the whole of the ions or radicals formed by X-rays are eliminated by collision with
carboxypeptidase and only a negligible proportion by the alternative reaction. If the fact
that the a-ray yield is only one-twentieth of the X-ray yield is taken to indicate that, on
account of the high ion density within the a-ray column, only one-twentieth of the ions or
radicals make collisions with enzyme molecules before they are eliminated, the probability
of encounter between radicals and enzyme molecules must be correspondingly low. That
probability should therefore be proportional to the concentration of enzyme molecules. It was with this point specially in mind that the influence of enzyme concentrations on
a-particle ionic yield was studied.
