B = Bo[1+b(@—4%)]. The constants 8 and b were determined graphically by plotting 8 against (6 — 4).
Finally the ratio 8)/ ./a was found to be very nearly constant in the case of each wire as shown in the
graph of fig. 7, and its mean value is seen to be in fair agreement with that calculated from the theoretical
investigation of Part I.

Table VI. contains the analysis of the constant C. ‘The part of this term due to radiation is calculated
in the manner described in Section 13, making use of the observations of LuMMER and Kuripaum. In
heavy-faced type are given the values of C) = C—E and beneath it, in italics, the ratios y = Co/(@- 4%),
which it will be seen vary comparatively slowly with temperature and radius. For each wire the
constants yo and ¢ of the formula y = yy[1+¢(@=)] were determined graphically. The constant yo
varies slightly with the radius and its value is not far removed from that required by the theory of
Section 6. The value of y, for Wire No. 2 shows a discrepancy which was explained, on microscopic
observation, as due to the fact that owing to the use of an imperfect die the wire was badly scored along
its length.
