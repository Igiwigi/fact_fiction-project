The moment we pass from the metals to
their compounds we pass from a series of good conductors to bad ones, and from a series
of bad radiators to good ones®. In the earlier memoirs of MM. Ds LE ProvyosTarE and DE8AINSF, and in that of MM.
WIEDEMANN and FRAxz, T find the following facts :—The radiative power of platinum is
five times that of silver; its conductive power is one-tenth that of silver. Platinum has
more than twice the radiative power of gold; it has only one-seventh of the conducting-
power. Zinc and tin are almost equal as conductors, and they are also nearly equal as
radiators.
