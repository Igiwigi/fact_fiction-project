'= From the period of my appointment to the Hunterian Professorship of Physiology at
=the Royal College of Surgeons, London, in 1836, I lost no opportunity of urging this
Llpaderetum upon the attention of correspondents in Ceylon and India; and, after 8ome
Sears, T had the gratification to receive a letter from Dr. MoRTox, an accomplished Army
Medical Officer quartered in Ceylon, stating that he had forwarded to me the membranes
of a fetal Elephant, addressed to the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. On
Zthe arrival of this specimen in a keg of arrack, I prosecuted as complete an examination
as the condition of the parts would permit, and made the preparations (Nos. 3558 0. and
$3558 D.), which are now in the Physiological Series of that Museum. The results of this
examination were orally communicated in the Theatre of the College, in the 17th Lec-
Sture of my Course © On the Generation and Development of the Vertebrate Animals,”
delivered in 1850+; and were illustrated by diagrammatic views of the chief peculiarities
"==which the parts presented. Circumstances prevented further publication of the facts at
that time; but I am now able to submit the following description of the foetal mem-
Sbranes and placenta of the Elephant to the Royal Society.
S The chorion of the Elephant (Plate XVI. fig. 1, a, a, 4), at about the middle of
=the period of utero-gestation, forms a transversely oblong sac, 2 feet 6 inches in long
Sdiameter, and 1 foot 4 inches in short diameter, encompassed at its middle part by an
annular placenta (6, 6), 2 feet 6 inches in circumference, varying from 3 to 5 inches in
breadth, and from 1 to 2 inches in thickness. This placenta is partially divided by
opposite constrictions into two moieties, one measuring 12 inches, the other 10 inches
in length, and the extreme breadth being 5 inches in each ; the connecting isthmus is
3 inches in breadth. The placenta presents the same spongy texture and vascularity as
does the annular placenta of the Hyrax and of the Carnivora; -but the capillary filaments
or villosities enclosing the foetal vessels enter into its formation in a larger proportion,
