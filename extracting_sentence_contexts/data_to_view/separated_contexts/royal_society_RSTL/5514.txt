When the silver is much heated, there is no doubt that the leaf runs up into particles
more or less separate. But the question still remains as to the first effect of heat,
whether it merely causes a retraction of the particles, or really changes the optical and
physical nature of the metal from the beaten or pressed state to another from which
pressure can return it back again to its more splendid condition. It seems just possible
that the leaf may consist of an infinity of parts resulting from replications, foldings and
scales, all laid parallel by the beating which has produced them, and that the first action
of heat is to cause these to open out from each other; but that supposition leaves many
of the facts either imperfectly explained or untouched. The Arts do not seem to fur-
nish any process which can instruct us as to this condition, for all the operations of
polishing, burnishing, &c. applied to gold, silyer and other metals, are just as much fitted
to produce the required state under one view as under the other. To return to gold: it is clear that that metal, reduced to small dimensions by mere
mechanical means, can appear of two colours by transmitted light, whatever the cause
of the difference may be.
