In this zone also the Corylus begins to
rise, although this is more marked in the following zone. The Corylus curve also is
much more irregular in behaviour than the rest, changing greatly from site to site. Although these qualifications are necessary, -it is, nevertheless, a striking fact that
similar changes to these can be readily seen in other parts of Britain, as far afield, at
least, as Somerset, Shropshire, and Cardiganshire. It represents, therefore, a well-
marked and general climatic change, and it seems reasonable to regard it as the onset
of the climatic ‘“‘deterioration”’ which indicates the change from sub-Boreal to sub-
Atlantic all over north-western Europe. At the same time it is evident that this
“‘deterioration”’ was not necessarily sudden, and we propose to use the transition
zone VII—-VIII to cover this period of change.
