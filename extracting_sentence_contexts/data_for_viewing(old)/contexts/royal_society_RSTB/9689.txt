increased number of embryos for transfer into recipient
females. These procedures created groups of full and half-
sibs. Finally, in the third group nuclei from some embryos
recovered from the donors were used to provide nuclei for
transfer to produce cloned offspring so adding further
groups of full and half-sibs along with groups that were
genetically identical. After adjusting for sire or dam effects
where appropriate, the calves produced by nuclear transfer
were approximately 20% heavier than those derived either
by mating or embryo transfer. More striking still, the variabil-
ity in birth weight of clones was 4-12 times greater than that
for the other groups [42]. In other words, the groups that
were expected to be very similar were in fact less uniform.
The differences in weight had almost completely disappeared
by 1 year of age. Increases in birth weight were also observed
in several other experimental situations including embryo
culture in the presence of serum (as reviewed in [43]).
Detailed analyses of the ‘large offspring syndrome’
revealed not only changes in birth weight, but also pertur-
bation of coefficients of growth of major organs including
liver, heart and kidney suggesting not only that overall
growth was disturbed, but that development of major organs
had been fundamentally disturbed [43]. These changes in
sheep fetuses were found to be associated with changes in
expression of IGF2R, an imprinted gene [44]. Similar pertur-
