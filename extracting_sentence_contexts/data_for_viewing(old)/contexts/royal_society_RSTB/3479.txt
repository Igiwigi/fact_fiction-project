LEAVES AND INFLORESCENCES OF WELWITSCHIA MIRABILIS. 215

surrounding the mucilage cavities in the cortex, is probably conditioned by the
mechanical necessities of the organs concerned, and it is difficult to draw theoretical
conclusions concerning it. Marre* finds that the centripetal wood in the
ovuliferous scales of Cycads passes over into transfusion tissue which may spread in
a ring round the bundles. In a similar way the lignified elements internal to the
protoxylem and external to the phloem in the bundles of the Welwitschian
peduncles have been seen to pass over at a higher level into complete bundles and
at a lower level into transfusion tissue. It is questionable, however, if it can be
argued from this series of facts that the transfusion tissue in the leaf and bract is
homologous with centripetal xylem.

A. The relation between Welwitschia and other members of the Gnetales would
not appear to be very close. The ovule of Ginetum africanumt has some characters
probably more primitive than are found in either Ephedra or Welwitschia, but in its
gametophyte Ephedra is the most primitive of the three. As so much work on
these genera is at this present time in course of preparation it would seem
inadvisable here to discuss this question further.

On the other hand recent anatomical investigations have brought to light various
