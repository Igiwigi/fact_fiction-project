an element of a general non-commutative mathematical structure, part of (infinite-dimensional)
linear algebra, in effect in a Hilbert space over complex numbers, in which Heisenberg’s
matrices (‘observables’) form an operator algebra. One can also see it as a representation of an
abstract algebra, keeping in mind that Heisenberg’s infinite matrices were unbounded, which
fact is necessary to have the uncertainty relations for the corresponding continuous variables.
As unbounded self-adjoint matrices, these matrices do not form an algebra with respect to
the composition as a non-commutative product, although some of them satisfy the canonical
commutation relation.

Heisenberg begins his derivation by observing that ‘in quantum theory it has not been possible
to associate the electron with a point in space, considered as a function of time, by means of
observable quantities. However, even in quantum theory it is possible to ascribe to an electron
the emission of radiation’ ([32], p. 263; emphasis added). My emphasis reflects the fact that in
principle a measurement could associate an electron with a point in space, but not as a function
of time, as in classical mechanics. Heisenberg then says:

In order to characterize this radiation we first need the frequencies which appear as
functions of two variables. In quantum theory these functions are in the form:

v(n,n — w) =1/h{W(n) —W(n—a@)} (1)
and in classical theory in the form

v(n,a) =av(n)=a/h(dW/dn).  ([32], p. 263)
