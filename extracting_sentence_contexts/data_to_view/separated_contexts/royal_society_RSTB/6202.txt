From a cionid-like ancestor ascidians have apparently evolved in two main
directions, one involving the descent of the viscera into the stalk, the other the
shifting of the viscera forwards along the branchial wall. The first of these
evolutionary trends gives rise to the order Aplousobranchiata (LAHILLE) or Kriko-
branchiata (SEELIGER) together with the family Diazonidae. In fact, HARTMEYER
(1923) saw such a close relationship between the diazonids and Ciona that he
included them within one family. IV—DEscenT OF THE VISCERA

Diazona, like Ciona, is an oviparous genus. It is the only genus with the faculty
for budding that is so.
