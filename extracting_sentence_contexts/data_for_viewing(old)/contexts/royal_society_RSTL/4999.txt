cilia, In this anatomical arrangement the physiologist discerns a true intention, that
of exposing the fluid contents to the atrating agency of the surrounding medium. In
Rhizostoma the yellow colour bas its seat in the fluid, not in the floating cells. It is
a fact of singular interest, that the corpuscles of the chylaqueous fluid in this, as in
ALL other classes in which it exists, vary in $ize with the variations in the size of the
body of the individual specimen under examination. In this respect they are diame-
trically distinguished from the morphotic elements of the #rue-blood in vertebrated
animals, the corpuscles of which bear no proportion in size to that of the body of the
animal from which they are taken. This general observation will be afterwards con-
firmed by a variety of particular exemplifications. It has now been shown that in
Zoophytes and Medusz sea-water is admitted in large quantities, more or less directly,
into the chylechannels, with the contents of which it more or less directly mixes and
vitally assimilates. This fact may at present be mentioned as another fundamental par-
ticular, in which the chylaqueous fluid, in ALL animals, is distinguished from the blood-
proper, for into this latter fluid the external element is never immediately admitted ;
it is previously subjected to the influence of one or more organic processes ; it is thus

Mr. HuxLuy had recognised the principle that in all Acalephz the interior lining of the atomach and gastro-
vascular canals was more or less generally ciliated, that the moyements of the fluid contents were in great part

due to the agency of cilia,
