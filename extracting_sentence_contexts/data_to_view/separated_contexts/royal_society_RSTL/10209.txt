PFirst, it is desirable to dispel as far as
pPossible the idea upon which 80 much stress is laid by ErcnLes, that there is an important difference
between the © blattgrund,” and * oberblatt ” (7.c., p. 25, * wesentlich von einander verschiedene Theile ”) :
this may bes be done by dropping his terms; secondly, while rejecting the general term © oberblatt ”
as expressing an idea which is not in accord with morphological method as applied to the axis, ib is
desirable to observe uniformity in the terminology,

+ T purposely leave out of account the foliar Muscinec, though these are 80 often used in comparison
with vascular plants. Tb is often forgotten, while comparing the vegetative organs of Muscinees with
those of the yascular plants, that tho structures compared are not homologous, but at best only analogous
developments. LEAF IN THE VASCULAR CRYPTOGAMS AND GYMNOSPERAMS. 571

study is fully to justify the treatment of the whole leaf as a branch system, while it
brings into greater prominence the fact that the main axis of the leaf in the more com-
plicated forms has undergone a progressive differentiation as a supporting organ, as dis-
tinet from the branches of higher order which it bears ; further, that as we pass upwards
through the scale of vascular plants, there is a tendency to an earlier arrest of the apical
growth of the phyllopodium ; this, together with the increased prominence of the results
of intercalary growth, which has in many cases 80 distorted the branching s8ystem of the
leaf, gives a ready explanation of the origin of those methods of treatment of the leaf,
which I have alluded to above. S Comparative Study o the Leaf. E Taking first that family of the Leptosporangiate Ferns* in which the simplest structure
