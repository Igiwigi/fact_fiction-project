Similar results showing a gradual increase in the value of 7 as the velocity increases
have been obtained by the reduction of the observations for the 0°7125 and 1°255 em.
pipes, and it may therefore be taken as fully demonstrated that an index law for
surface friction cannot be devised which will express the facts with any accuracy,
except over a comparatively small range in the value of vd/v. It will be obvious that
this factor must be borne in mind in predicting the skin friction of large bodies
moving in a fluid from observations on small-scale models moved in the same fluid. The Comparison of the Results with those of Previous Experimenters. As the method of representing the results of the surface friction experiments
described in this paper is somewhat novel, it has been considered advisable to reduce
the observations of some well-known previous experimenters, in a similar manner, and
to plot them all on the same diagram for the purpose of comparison.
