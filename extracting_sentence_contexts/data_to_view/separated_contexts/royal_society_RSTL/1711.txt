Reduction to a vacuum. M. BxssEL has shown, in his very interesting work on the pendulum #, that
the usual formula for the reduction to a vacuum, as far as the specific gravity
of the moving body is concerned, is very defective; and by no means expresses
the whole of the correction which ought to be applied : in fact, that a quan-
tity of air is also set in motion by, and adheres to, the pendulum (varying
according to its form and construction), and thus a compound pendulum is in
all cases produced, the specific gravity of which will be much less than that of
the metal itself. He states (page 32) that © if we denote by mz the mass of a
* body moving through a fluid, and by mz the mass of the fluid displaced
thereby, the accelerating force acting on the body has, since the time of
m—m

m

'This formula is founded on the

* Newron, been considered equal to

* presumption that the moving force, which the body undergoes, and which is
« denoted by m—m, is confined to the mass m. But, it must be distributed not
* only over the moving body, but on all the particles of the fluid set in motion
* by that body ; and consequently the denominator of the expression, denoting
* the accelerating force, must necessarily be greater than m.” M.
