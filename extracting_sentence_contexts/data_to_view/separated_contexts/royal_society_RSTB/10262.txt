In the case of very low endogenous DNA content or
poor preservation, other methods can still be used to retrieve
ancient genetic information. All of these methods aim at focus-
ing preferentially on the endogenous fraction preserved in the
DNA extract. Leveraging on the fact that human and bacte-
rial DNA methylation marks do not occur in similar base
compositional contexts, methyl-binding domains (MBDs)
targeting human-like methylation marks can be used to separ-
ate human from bacterial DNA in aDNA extracts [73]. However, as (i) the deamination rate of methylated epialleles
is much faster than that of unmethylated epialleles and
(ii) deaminated methylated epialleles do not bind MBDs, this
approach is only recommended for the analysis of recent
fossil material. Other approaches consist of enriching amplified
aDNA libraries using annealing to pre-selected oligonucleotide
baits complementary to the regions of interest.
