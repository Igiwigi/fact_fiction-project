We have hitherto dealt with cases which may be treated theoretically as well as
experimentally. But the number of such cases is very limited, and the vast majority
of two-dimensional magnetic problems are beyond the powers of analysis. It is in
such cases that the stream-line method employed by us becomes a powerful weapon
of research. Figs. 25-28 relate to cylinders of rectangular section, figs. 25 and 26
giving the field distributions for cylinders of square section placed with one of their
diagonals at 45° to the field and parallel to it respectively. In fig. 25, where the
width of the cylinder remains constant along the direction of the impressed field,
we notice that the lines inside the cylinder are concave outwards ; in fig. 26, on
the other hand, where the cylinder tapers rapidly as we proceed along the field, the
curvature of the lines presents a convexity outwards. This suggests that an inter-
mediate form between the two might be found for which the lines exhibit neither
convexity nor concavity, #.¢., are straight ; and, as a matter of fact, we know of one
such intermediate form—a circular cylinder. Fig. 26 closely corresponds to the
theoretical case which Dr. C. H. Lens has recently succeeded in working out analyti-
cally in connection with a problem in heat conduction.* Figs. 27 and 28 are intended
to illustrate the effect of increasing the length of one of the sides of the rectangular
section while keeping the other constant. We know from theoretical considerations
that this has the effect of reducing the de-magnetising factor, and thus increasing
the flux through the cylinder. This point is very clearly brought out by a comparison
of figs, 25, 27, and 28.

Figs. 29 and 30 (Plate 19) show the magnetic fields corresponding to a cylinder of
triangular section in two different positions.
