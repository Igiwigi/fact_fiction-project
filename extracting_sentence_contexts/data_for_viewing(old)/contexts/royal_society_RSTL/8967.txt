Ramp. is the perpendicular from the centre of the circle of inversion upon the
TTY

tangent to the dirigent conic, and EIS is the half-chord which this perpendicular
2 #7

forms with the generating circle. Hence = —1=(perpendicular — halt-chord)

—haltf-chord, the numerator being in fact the distance of the element dS (or point X, Y)
from the centre of inversion : the formula thus is

= Ie
d8=+5/. dv,

where 3 is the radius of the generating citcle, g the distance of the element from the

centre of the circle of inversion, and c the chord which this distance forms with the
generating circle. If we consider the two points on the generating circle, and write

—_—_
ds8' for the element, at the other point, then we have (dS+dS')= + S=eED =2 dv
