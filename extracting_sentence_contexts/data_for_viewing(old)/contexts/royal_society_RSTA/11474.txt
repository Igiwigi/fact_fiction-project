Qe carried out. A block of the glass, 13 millims. thick, was similarly employed for this
urpose. The operations of making these preliminary determinations of the con-
â€œtants of the interference apparatus will so fully include all the necessary manipu-
ative and adjusting operations in connection with the use of the apparatus, that
Sthe description of the mode of conducting them, and the discussion of the mode of
calculating the coefficients of expansion from the experimental results obtained, will
at once be proceeded with.

Determination of the Expansion of the Platinum-Iridium Interference Tripod.

This is the most difficult of all the operations in connection with the work, on
account of the fact that it is necessarily performed with the two reflecting surfaces,
the under surface of the large glass cover-wedge laid upon the three screws and tie
upper surface of the platinum-iridium table, separated at the relatively long distance -

of somewhat over a centimetre. At this distance it is most difficult to generate
satisfactory bands with C or F hydrogen light, and it is only at all possible with
sodium light provided the exact distance of a FizeaAvu maximum is attained. The use _
of the light corresponding to the green mercury line, as recommended by Putrricn,
