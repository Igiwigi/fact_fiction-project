This is as it should be, for the actual dissipation from the
earth’s surface (which the instrument is designed to measure) depends largely on the
wind strength. In order that the instrument should measure the amount of dissipation
taking place from the earth’s surface, it should be exposed to the same wind condition
as the general surface. This fact bas not been fully realized by most observers. It
has been quite a common practice to shelter the instrument from the wind, either by
erecting screens or by observing close to a building, and in several cases the instrument
has been placed within a room close to an open window. Observations taken under
such conditions are of very little value ; they are certainly of no use in comparing the
dissipation of one place with that of another, and at the best can only be used to
compare variations from time to time at the same place.
