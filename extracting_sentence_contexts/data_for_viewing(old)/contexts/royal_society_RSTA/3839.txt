of the electromagnetic field, leaving the orientations of the electric- and magnetic-field vectors :3
unchanged, which is consistent with the requirement that the electric and magnetic fields be : wu
solenoidal [50]. Note that the combination of the spin and orbital rotational symmetries (2.5) is
and (2.12) gives a complete geometrical rotation of the electromagnetic field, associated with the Dw
conservation of the complete angular momentum [36,43] :

a =r x (Ex B)dV. (2.13) 3

It is natural, perhaps, to ask whether there is a quantity related to orbital angular momentum
as helicity is related to spin [61]. It appears, however, that it is not possible to construct a
non-vanishing quantity of this sort. This may be appreciated by noting that the integrand of
L is perpendicular to the wavevector k at each point in reciprocal space [57,77,78] so that the
component of this integrand along k is zero, which is reminiscent of the fact that the projection
of a particle’s orbital angular momentum parallel to the particle’s direction of motion is zero, as
(rx 4) -r=0.

(c) Boost angular momenta

Our attention has been focused thus far on the familiar concept that rotations (of the usual,
circular character) in space are connected to the conservation of angular momenta. Somewhat
less familiar but equally important is the fact that light also carries angular momenta for which
the conservation is associated instead with ‘rotations’ of hyperbolic character in space-time.
