by him in the teeth of the mouse, rat, dog, and calf. : The epithelial sheath, according to this author, is an extension of the enamel
organ to form the investment of the forming root of the tooth, and in fact controls
and limits the growth of the dentine. He says, “ Where there is no epithelial sheath
there are no odontoblasts and no dentine formation.” He showed that MALassxz’s epithelial rests in the periodontal membrane are part
of this sheath, and he was the first author to ascribe a distinct function to this
prolongation of epithelial cells.
