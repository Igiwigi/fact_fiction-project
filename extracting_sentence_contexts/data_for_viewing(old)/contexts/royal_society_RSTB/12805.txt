observed both experimentally and computationally via abla-
tion of the trailing cluster, see figure 6e,f and [11], respectively.
On the other hand, in [11], the arrest of the leading cluster is
not observed when the gap between the two fragments is
short enough. Such a situation is easily reproduced numeri-
cally by the removal of a smaller group of PM cells (i.e. of a
nearly d,-wide stripe) just close to the head of the primordium
along with the deposited proto-neuromast, see figure 6g,h.
