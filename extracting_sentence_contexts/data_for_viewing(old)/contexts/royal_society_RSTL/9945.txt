: action induced by the pumping out of the upper layers ; and the results indicated that
the action extended beyond the depth to which the samples were taken.

On the plot manured with mineral manure and nitrate of soda, in that year one
species, the Bromus mollts, contributed nearly half the produce ; its wiry roots have a
very characteristically downward tendency, and they were found to penetrate deeper
than those of any other of the grasses, and, therefore, to have acquired command of
lower layers than any as80ciated with them ; and this was especially 80 compared
with the herbage on plot 9, with the ammonia-salts. The result was that the lower
layers were pumped drier, and, under these cireumstances, the drought affected the
amount of crop but little.

In accordance with these facts as to the difference in the character of growth, and
the amount of water found at different depths, great differences were observed in the
characters of the soil and 8ubsoil of the several plots.

The firs nine inches of oil of the unmanured plot possessed the character of mould
in nearly the same degree as that of the manured plots. The second nine inches was
also very much altered from the character of the clay subsoil. Below this point very
slight difference was observable, though the next, the third from the surface, perhaps
