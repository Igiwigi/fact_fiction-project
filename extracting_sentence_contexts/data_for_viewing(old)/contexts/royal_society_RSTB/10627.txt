specific alternating configuration of the synchronous tone
pairs, presented separately to the two ears, leads to a
unique competitive engagement between the two synchro-
nous tones, causing them to separate perceptually into two
streams of their individual frequencies (for example, listeners
can perceive synchronous tones L/Hi and R/Lo as two
perceptual streams).

The question now arises as to why the two synchronous
tones (L/Hi and R/Lo) are heard as temporally misaligned.
It is well known that temporal judgements between sounds
belonging to different streams are inaccurate and difficult,
and in fact, are commonly used as an objective measure or
indicator of streaming [36,37], even when the sounds are syn-
chronous [34,38]. Furthermore, previous work on temporal
order judgements of repeating sequences of short-duration
(less than 300 ms) stimuli [39-42] suggests it is easy to recog-
nize the identity of the stimuli but difficult to judge their
temporal order. In the context of the current illusion, we
hypothesize that due to the synchronous tones falling into
separate perceptual streams, it becomes difficult for listeners
to judge the temporal relationships between these stimuli
[38], and that because they are heard as separate, they are
by default heard as alternating, in line with the onsets of
the tone sequences.
