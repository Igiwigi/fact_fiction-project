'= thus be visible at a second point B, when a source at B would be invisible at A;
S a state of things at first 8:9ht inconsistent with the second law of thermodynamics.
V 2. It is known that the rotation may be considered to be due to the propagation
Y at slightly different velocities of the two circularly polarized components, into
Z which plane polarized light may be resolved ; and it is interesting to consider
5 what difference of velocity our instrumental appliances enable us to detect. A
retardation amounting to one wave length (X), of one circularly polarized component
relatively to the other would correspoud to a rotation of the plane of polarisation
through 180%. If we can observe a rotation of one minute, we are in a position
to detect a retardation of X/10800. If 7 be the thickness traversed, v and Â»+8v
the two velocities of propagation, the relative retardation is I 8v/v. To take an
example, suppose that 1=20 inches, X= 5gSggth inch ; 80 that if 8v/v exceed 1073,
the fact might be detected.* It appears therefore that we are able to observe
extraordinarily minute relative differences in the velocities of propagation of the two
circularly polarised rays.

3. The laws of the phenomenon were invesbigated in detail by VERDEr, who proved
experimentally that in a given medium the rotation between any two points on a ray
of light of given kind is proportional to the difference of magnetic potential at those
