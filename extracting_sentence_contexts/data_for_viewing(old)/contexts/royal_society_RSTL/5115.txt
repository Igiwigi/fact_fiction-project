And sImilarly, we may show that

yZ—$Y=0
2$X—2Z=0;
whence X:L:Z::8X

And this is, virtually, the Parallelogram of Forces.

Thus it appears that the notation #.» is capable of affording a simple proof of the.
great fundamental theorem of Statics ; this application of the method is given, however,
as I stated above, merely to show by example what can be done in this way. I may
observe that the whole of the proof here given depends simply upon 7wo things, the
distributiveness of 4.v, and the fact that numerical coefficients may be brought out

and incorporated by actual multiplication. I now proceed to give, generally, the
mode of applying the notation to determine the conditions of equilibrium of a rigid
body, or a system of particles.

(74.) Remarkable symbolization of a Force acting at a Specified Point of a Rigid
Body. One of the most remarkable symbolizations which my proposed method leads
to appears to me to be the following.
