4 MacCutiaGu’s theory of the double refraction in crystalline media will hold good as
3 the first approximation. But just like ordinary refraction, this crystalline refraction
is subject to dispersive variation when the wave-length of the light is altered. This
g dispersion of the optic axes in crystals is usually small compared with the double

2 refraction itself, which justifies the present mode of treatment of it as a subsidiary
Bett to be joined to the main part of the double refraction. In order to obtain
gcaations of propagation in which it shall be included, we have only to add to the
Fe effective coefticient of inertia of the ether in MacCutraau’s equations a subsidiary
 molotropic part. This part may be complex instead of real when the medium is not
perfectly transparent, thus including the effect of conduction arising from the
presence of free ions; the general equations of absorbing doubly refracting media
& may in fact be formulated without difficulty on the lines of § 11
z For transparent media, this generalization of MacCuLLaGu’s theory preserves the
Wave-surface, corresponding to any given period of the light, exactly Fresnen’s.
_ The character of the laws of crystalline reflexion also remains unaltered, but the
_ constants that are involved in them are no longer exactly the same constants that
 eecur in the equation of the wave-surface.
__ The asymmetric refraction of higher order, which evidences itself by rotation of the
plane of polarization, is obviously of a structural kind, and so is correctly represented
by MacCutxacu’s terms. It is itself a highly dispersive phenomenon, on account of
the higher differential coefficients on which it depends; thus the dispersion due to
Variation of its constants with the wave-length may usually be neglected in
comparison. |
