424 MR. J. BARCROFT AND OTHERS: OBSERVATIONS UPON THE EFFECT OF

Our diffidence in the use of the coefficient (40) rises not from any doubt that
remains in our minds about the possibility of secretion; it is due to the fact that
the conditions of respiration make the accurate application of the coefficient difficult
and, indeed, impossible. Yet, granting the impossibility of obtaining sufticiently
accurate data for the estimation of the diffusion coefficient by Bours’ method, we
may still derive some useful information by the application of this theory to a set of
conditions such as may be assumed from our observations to occur at various
altitudes, and if various degrees of compensation have been accomplished. The
sources of our misgiving should be stated at the outset.
