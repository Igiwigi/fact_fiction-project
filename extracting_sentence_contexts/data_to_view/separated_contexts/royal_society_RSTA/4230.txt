Sl eP and S; | fi) with a= $n(1=) ®(Sw,+5—,) (e.g. [42, Lem. 12]). The following theorem 5.3 gives a construction for MRS, which relies on the fact that we can
introduce oscillations via Si which are much faster than oscillations in @,. The enforcement
of a decoupling of spatial scales via k, >>n of the microstructures generated by St, and 6n,
respectively, allows us to calculate the generated H-measure of the maximum function ¢; : x +>
max{@n(x), SI. (x)} explicitly. The proof of this result will be postponed to §5c, and figure 1 gives
a sketch of the construction, where very fine laminates generated by Si are combined with the
microstructure of 0,
