thalami prenucleares to the third neuromere of the fore-brain, the pineal outgrowths to
the fourth neuromere of the fore-brain, the recessus geniculorwm to the first neuromere
of the mid-brain,* and the optic lobes to the second neuromere of the mid-brain.

Jounston (1906), led away apparently by the idea that the antero-posterior
relations of the pineal outgrowths are primary, and not, as I believe, secondary,
places one epiphysial outgrowth in the third, and the other in the fourth neuromere.
Considering that the fourth neuromere, in accordance with the enumeration which he
adopts, belongs to the mesencephalon, while both epiphysial outgrowths lie in front of
the posterior commissure, this proceeding is manifestly inadmissible.

In the absence of further evidence, I do not wish to press my own suggestion as to
the neuromery of the fore- and mid-brain, but merely to bring forward facts which
must be taken into account before any final solution of the problem can be attained.
Whether three or more neuromeres have taken part in the formation of the fore-brain
makes little difference to the question of the supposed serial homology between the
pineal outgrowths and the lateral optic vesicles, but, of course, if these can be shown
both to belong to one and the same neuromere, as suggested by von Kurrrer, the
argument is seriously affected. I do not think, however, that the evidence for
regarding them as belonging to the same neuromere is any more convincing than
that for regarding them as belonging to different neuromeres, and, if my suggestion
as to the neuromery is correct, they are actually separated by an intervening
neuromere. We shall have occasion to refer to this question again when we come to
deal with the comparison of the pineal organs with the lateral eyes.
