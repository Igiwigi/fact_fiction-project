would otherwise show little or no change in depth. On the other hand, at the
bottom of the fissure the superticial layer would necessarily be thickened owing to

the large mass of fibres it would have to contain in spite of the relatively abrupt bend,
and for the same reason the deeper layers will be thinned, partly owing to their
occupying a relatively large convex area compared with the abrupt bend of the
superficial layers, and partly to the relatively fewer number of corticipetal and
corticifugal fibres which would require to pass through their convex extension of
surface. If to this be added the fact that the surface convexity is necessarily larger
in extent than the sharp bend at the bottom of the sulci, owing to the fact that
fibres have to pass to and from all the surface parts of the cortex, and that the larger
the external portion becomes the more acute must be the bend at the bottom of the
fissure, probably the explanation given may be considered as entirely satisfactory a
one as any that can be advanced.

That the explanation given is probably correct is seen on examination of the table
in fig, 47, for in the visuo-sensory area it is certain that many more fibres pass to the
cortex than is the case in the visuo-psychic region illustrated in the table in fig. 48.
It is at once evident by comparing the figures of the two tables that the thinning of
the layers at the bottoms of the fissures in the visuo-sensory cortex is relatively much
more marked than is the alteration in depth of the various layers of the apices and
flat surfaces; in other words, the bend at the bottom of the fissures is relatively
