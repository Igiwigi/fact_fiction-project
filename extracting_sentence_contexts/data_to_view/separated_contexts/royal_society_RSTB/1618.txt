Vibrations in water travel with more than quadruple the rapidity with which they are
transmitted in an, but they cun be appreciated at far greater distances. ‘There is, in
fact, u closer analogy between water and solid bodies than belween water and air, so
far we the transmission of sound vibrations is concerned. ‘These facts may, Lo some
extent perhaps, be physiologically imstrated by the statement Ulut the relations of
the Miditory organ of a Fish to w sounding body in water are not very dissimilar to

those of an air-breathing Vertebrate when its skull is directly connected with the
source of sound. ‘That thie is to some extent true is borne out by experiment. Th
making their celebrated experiments on the transmission of sound in the water of Lake
Geneva, Contapon and Sours found that sound vibrations, toa feéble to produce
any appreciable effect on the external surface of the skull when they passed through
air could, nevertheless, strongly impress the ear when they were propagated in water
