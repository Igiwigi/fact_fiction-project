We want first to save the labour of calculating 7 for cases where
the data are comparatively poor, and so reaching a fairly approximate result rapidly. But labour-saving is never a wholly satisfactory excuse for adopting an inferior
method. The second and chief reason for seeking such a coefficient as Q lies in the
fact that all our reasoning in this paper is based upon the normality of the frequency. We require to free ourselves from this assumption if possible, for the difficulty, as
is exemplified in Illustration V. below, is to find material which actually obeys
within the probable errors any such law. Now, by considering the coefficient of
regression, 70/0, = S(y)/(No oy), as the slope of the line which best fits the series
