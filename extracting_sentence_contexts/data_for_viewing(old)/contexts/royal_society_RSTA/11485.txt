(8) A corresponding series of measurements of the direct osmotic equilibrium
pressures for the purpose of comparison with those to be deduced from the
measurements of (2) by means of the equation.

(4) Measurements of the compressibilities of the solutions and of water.

(5) A knowledge of the change in the specific volume of water vapour with
pressure—this knowledge we assume is given by ReGgnautt’s work.

Choice of Solute.

Owing to the fact that, in the direct measurement of osmotic pressures, the copper
ferrocyanide membrane is semipermeable to but few substances, the choice is strictly
limited. In calcium ferrocyanide a substance was found which seemed likely to throw
considerable light on osmotic phenomena.

Aqueous solutions of this substance have the following properties :—The copper
ferrocyanide membrane is practically impermeable to the salt. The salt is very
soluble, so that strong solutions can be obtained and hence high equilibrium pressures ;
the solutions at all strengths are apparently stable enough at 0° C. to allow the
necessary data to be obtained. The solutions show a considerable shrinkage on
dilution, and this fact makes it possible to determine experimentally the s of the
equation.
