of interference with the accuracy of the results owing to a considerable oscillation
of pressure arising from the action of the pump. We had remarked that when
the number of strokes of the engine was suddenly reduced from twenty-seven to
twenty-five per minute, a depression of the thermometer equal to some hundredths
of a degree Cent. took place, a cireumstance evidently owing to the entire mass
of air in the coils and cotton plugs suffering dilatation without allowing time
<for the escape of the consequent thermal effect. Hence it was found absolutely
Sexsential to keep the pump working at a perfectly uniform rate. For a similar reason
it, was also most important to prevent the oscillations of pressure due to the action
=of the pump, particularly as it appeared obvious that the heat evolved by the sudden
=increase of pressure, on the admission of a fresh supply of air from the pump, would
LCarrive at the thermometer in a larger proportion than the cold produced by the sub-
Zsequent gradual dilatation. In fact, on making an experiment in which the air was
Zkept at a low pressure, by opening a stopeock provided for the purpose, the oscilla-
Ztions of pressure amounting to {5th of the whole, it was fonnd that an apparent
heating effect, equal to 0*2 Cent., was produced instead of a small cooling effect.

It became therefore necessary to obviate the aboye source of error, and the method
>first employed with that view, was to place a diaphragm of copper with a hole in its
Scentre #th of an inch in diameter at the junction between the iron and copper
ZSpipes. The oscillation being thus reduced, s0 as to be hardly perceptible, we made
Zthe following observations.
