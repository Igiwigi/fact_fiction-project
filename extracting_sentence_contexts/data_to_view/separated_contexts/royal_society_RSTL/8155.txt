That in those cages where in the solar spectrum the whole number of lines given
by a metal do not appear, those that do thus appear are the longest lines.

3rd., That it was possible to ascertain roughly by the number of lines left in a spectrum
when a metal was alloyed, the percentage of it existing in the alloy.

4th. That greater tension of the incandescent vapour giving a spectrum would pro-
bably increase the number of lines in a spectrum. The examination of the various spectra of metals and alloys undertaken in connexion
with these researches afforded evidence not only of the great impurity of most of the
metals used, but of the fact that many, if not all, of the coincidences observed by 'THALEN
and others might be explained in the light of former work. An examination of ANGSTROM'S map of the solar spectrum shows many cases in which
a line has been obseryed to be common to two or more spectra; and this is especially
the case with the lines of iron, titanium, and calcium, nearly every other solar metallic
spectrum exhibiting one or more cases of coincidence with the latter. Now it is first to be remarked that these cases of coincidence can scarcely be acci-
dental.
