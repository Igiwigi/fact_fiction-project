magnetic body (2807.). Elsewhere, the lines of force go with the s8ame direction
across the magnetic field where the iron is, as where it is not; and it is to me a
proved fact, proved by the numerous results given, that a section of the lines of force
taken across the magnetic field through the air, where there is no iron, is exactly
equal in amount of force to a section taken across parallel to and through the iron disc
(3163.). All iron under induction must bave just as much force, 5. e. lines of force
in its internal parts, as is equivalent to the lines which fall on to, and are continued
through and out of it; and the same is true, as it appears to me, of any other para-
magnetic or diamagnetic substance whatever.
