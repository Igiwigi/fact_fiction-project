Br (na, +m0_,) = ¥ eas) ,
where Vj (din%mn) is identical with V (d,,@n,) except in the central row, the elements
of which are equal to rv, (r > 0) or (7 <0), the positive numerical value of r being
taken in both cases. On applying the operation of continued differencing by columns
we obtain the result

Va (Smn@mnn)

(5°37) Zr (nya, + vyft_») = a V (Sun Ch Ey

where V,(dnx%mn) differs from V(d,.4m,) Only in the central row, all the elements
of which are zero save those on either side the centre (7 = 1 and r = —1), which are
respectively equal to », and ». This follows from the fact that

sor =0 (r ¥ 1), agr-=1\(r= 1).
Again, from (5°21), we may prove in the usual way that

IV (te Omn
~ F(nlmn)

_)

where V, and V are the same, except that in the 7 column of V, all the elements are
zero save those on either side the centre (7.¢., » = + 0) which are unity. If in
V and V, we add half of each of the rows n = + 0 to the centre row; and subtract
