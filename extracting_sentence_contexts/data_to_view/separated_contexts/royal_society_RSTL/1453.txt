But as 800n as I removed
my eye from the tube, and contemplated the shadow with all
its neighbouring accompaniments, the other shadows ren-
dered really yellow by the effect of the yellow glass, and the
white paper which had likewise from the same cause acquired
a yellowish hue, the shadow in question appeared to me, as it
did to my assistant, of a beautiful blue colour. - I afterwards

repeated the same experiment with the apparently blue sha-
dow produced in the experiment with daylight and candle-

light, and with exactly the same result. How far these experiments may enable us to account for the
apparent blue colour of the sky, and the great variety of co-
lours which frequently adorn the clouds, as also what other
useful observations may be drawn from them, I leave to phi-
losophers, opticians, and painters to determine. In the mean
time, I believe it is a new discovery, at least it is undoubtedly
a very extraordinary fact, that the eyes are not always to
be believed, even with respect to the presence or absence of
colours,

I cannot finish this letter without mentioning one circum-
stance, which struck me very forcibly in all these experiments
upon coloured shadows, and that is, the most perfect harmony

which always appeared to subsist between the colours, what-
ever they were, of the two shadows; and this harmony seemed
to me to be full as perfect and pleasing when the shadows
were of different tints of brown, as when one of them was
blue and the other yellow. In short, the harmony of these
colours was in all cases not only very striking, but the ap-
pearances were altogether quite enchanting ; and I never
found any body to whom I showed these experiments whose
eyes were not fascinated with their bewitching beauties. It
is, however, more than probable, that a great part of the plea-
sure which these experiments afforded to the spectators arose
from the continual changes of colour, tint, and shade, with:
which the eye was amused, and the attention kept awake,
We are used to seeing colours fixed and unalterable, hard as
the solid bodies from which they come, and just as motion=
less, consequently dead, uninteresting, and tiresome to the
eye; but in these experiments all is motion, life, and beauty.
