only two terms, is the simplest form ; but as regards the expression of the results,
both (1) and (3) are superior in every respect, The equation (3) was adopted as the
standard form by M. Bacr in his paper of 1874 (se $VIIT.).

The form 24—2 for the exponent in Riccarr's equation (4) was firs employed, I
believe, in CAYLEY's paper in the © Philosophical Magazine* for 1868, which has been
already referred to. The use of the quantity q greatly simplifies the formulee relating
to the s0Jution of the equation.

With the exception of F VII., the memoir was written about three years ago, the
delay in communicating it to the Society being due to the fact that it seemed desirable
to connect the results more closely with BessgL's Functions. As the theory of these
functions forms a distinet, and recognised branch of analysis, and as the differential
equations considered are transformable into BessEL's equation by very simple changes
in the variables, it was clearly of importance to examine with 8ome care the connexion
of the formulz with those of Bxssxr's Functions, and it even 8eemed possible that it
might be advisable to adopt Bxsser's equation as the standard form. For the reasons
already stated it appeared that this was not the case, and that the analytical treat-
ment of the subject was complicated by the change to Brsser's equation. Tt is well
known that the general - integrals of the differential equations (1),.. . (4) can be
expressed in terms of Bessgr's Functions ; and LOMMEL has specially considered these
8olutions in several papers in the © Mathematische Annalen.'* In these papers,
however, the points to which the memoir relates are not referred to. Tt therefore
