Regarding the proximal sensor of environmental stimuli, it
has been proposed that environmental cues are sensed through
conserved elements of calcium and redox status that are trans-
duced to cellular signal pathways, and/or influence epigenetic
processes, to ultimately drive the differential expression of
sex genes (the CaRe model) [57]. If proved correct, this
would provide information on how cues such as temperature
are transduced. However, it could also be tested in other cir-
cumstances, e.g. cues such as population density or
population sex ratio driving sex change in sequential hermaph-
rodites. In any case, the CERS and CaRe models are compatible
and complementary because in fact they concern different
parts and aspects of the pathway, from the initial environ-
mental cue to the ultimate sexual fate. Histone modifications
may be induced before methylation changes that then
serve as more stable epigenetic marks [58]. The proposed
mechanistic models linking environmental signals and sex-
determination pathways can be useful to direct further
research.

Most of the examples above concern DNA methylation
and histone modifications but there is also evidence on long-
term changes in miRNA expression—also considered a type
of epigenetic regulation of gene expression—in response to
