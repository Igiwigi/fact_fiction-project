Specimens from these places are in the University Museum at, Copenhagen, and on my
return I obtained, through the courtesy of Professor JouxsmRUP, duplicate specimens from
the first two named. Until the time of our visit leaves had not, however, been found,
with the exception of a few specimens by Dr. LyaLL. Amber had, however, been found
at several places, and from this fact, and from the statement by Gresecks, that he had
himself observed impressions of leaves, there was little doubt but that a more careful
search would yield results. Tt was most important to find the place spoken of by
G1z8ECKE as Ritenbenk's Kulbrund. There was difficulty in doing s0: the natives differed
among themselves; but we now know that this name is applied equally to all the places
along the Waigat coast of Disco from which coal has been taken for Ritenbenk.
