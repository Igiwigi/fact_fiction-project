If we put a=1688 and þ= 26992 in the first and second of these and equate them,
the equation is satisfied by z=222 miles. And when this value of & is put in the
equation formed by equating the first and third values of Pm?, we obtain

=3559 miles.

The very close agreement of this result with that obtained from the calculations of
this paper, and shown in art. 49. to be 3544 miles, shows how exactly the law here
deduced represents the facts of the case. The value of &, viz. 222 miles, places the
line Pp on the part we have called the Plateau, running W.N.W. and E.S.E. about
thirty miles north of Gertope.

53. The law thus developed by aid of the curve enables us to interpolate the
amount of the deflection of the plumb-line at any station of the arc between Kaliana
and Damargida. Thus suppose X is the distance of the station from the fixed line
Pp, and A the distance of the centre of concentration for that station. Then
