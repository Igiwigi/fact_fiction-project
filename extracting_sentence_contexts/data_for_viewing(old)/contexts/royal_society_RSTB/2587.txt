the median plane, and on both sides of it lighter-looking
radiating calcareous fibres. Galamea is one of the forms in which the “dark line” is
plainly seen to be broken up into a number of “dark points,” and sometimes short,
dark lines. These component parts of the “dark lines” have been in recent coral
literature variously named spines, septal spines, primary spines, trabeculae, longi-
tudinal ridges, while the dark line itself has been called “primary streak,” “primary
septum,” “ Urseptum.”

The “dark line” in the wall of Galawea is similarly constituted of separate
“points” and “short lines.” Its position in the wall is, however, much nearer the
inner than the outer surface, a fact indicating that the deposition of calcareous
substance takes place chiefly on the extra-thecal part of the thecal fold. A
diagrammatic representation of the position of the ‘‘ dark line” in the septa and wall
of Galaxea is given in fig. 4.

tangential skeletal elements of Galavea.

Throughout Madreporaria we find that the “dark line” is extremely variable in
its position in the wall, but in the septa of all types, the “dark line” is always in
the median plane.
