T have also endeavoured to cultivate many of these flagellates on agar plates, using
the same nutrient medium and having the plate of a thin consistency, containing not
more than half per cent. agar-agar. Though I have not as yet persevered very much
in these attempts, because of the success and much greater convenience of the
observation-preparations, my experience has been that the thicker medium is not
N suitable for several of these forms. Helkesimastix, as already described, succeeds
© well. Bodo caudatus, after having become accustomed to the nutrient medium in
2  observation-preparations, also thrives on plates; similarly Cercomonas. So far, I
have had no success with Heteromita, Spiromonas, or Phyllomitus on plates.

Ss The use of these observation-preparations also has the advantage that the cover-
8 slip can be lifted off at any desired time and fixed. Asa matter of fact, I first of all

2 draw up part of the “hanging drop” into a fine pipette and then immediately drop
cp = the cover-slip on to the fixative. From the liquid in the pipette a smear is made and
4 stained with Giemsa after fixation by osmic vapour. For the cover-slip film, I have
found that an excellent fixative is a mixture of two parts of saturated aqueous
5 sublimate and one part of absolute alcohol (or rectified spirit), to which is added 5 per
‘3 cent. of acetic acid (S.A.A. mixture). . This is better than either Schaudinn’s fluid or
4 aqueous sublimate-acetic mixture. I have also used Gilson’s fluid. The best stain is
S  iron-heematoxylin (using the long method) ; I often counterstain with alcoholic eosin
