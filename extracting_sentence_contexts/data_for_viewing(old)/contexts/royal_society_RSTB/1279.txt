ia. These process which thus arise from the sub-archesporial pad are irregular
Hine and position ; they consist of a parenchymatous tissue, which is directly
imious with the base of the sporangium (figs. 97, 98); the cellular structure,

tum, figs. 66 and 67; and ZL. alpinum, fig. 77). This question can only be
ely answered. by observations of development, which can hardly be expected in

Apical parts of this remarkable cone ; it will be seen that in fig. 95, as the apex is
roached, the sporangia are successively smaller; those close to the apex have been
‘in their growth, and appear to contain no spores; the cavity of the
rangium is, however, traversed by cellular processes, rising from the base, and
7 upwards (figs. 99, 100); apparently these bands of sterile tissue extended

ubt, the fact of a tissue-connection between them and the wall; had that been
own to exist, the correspondence between these and the sterile trabecule of Tsoetes
vuld have been demonstrated, and, from the appearance of some of the sections, I
a inclined to the belief that this is their real nature ; in the absence of such proof it
