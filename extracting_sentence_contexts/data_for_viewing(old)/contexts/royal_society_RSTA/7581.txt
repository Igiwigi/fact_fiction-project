In the theory of wave propagation the above function has applications for which p may be com-
plex within a certain range of argument. Tables of the real and imaginary parts of the function
are given to four decimal places, for values of |p| from 0 to 0-80 at intervals of 0-01, and for values
of arg p from 0° to 45° at intervals of 1°.

1. INTRODUCTION

The tabulation of functions for complex values of their argument is very seldom under-
taken. This fact is, perhaps, not surprising in view of the enormous increase of labour
involved when the argument has two degrees of freedom. It is, however, unfortunate that
the widespread use of the complex variable in mathematical physics cannot be more
adequately supported by numerical tables. The deficiency is particularly noticeable in
wave theory; here the complex variable is an essential tool, but both the relatively simple
form and the physical content of a result may be destroyed by the necessity of separating it
into real and imaginary parts for the purpose of computation.

In the course of recent work on wave propagation, one of the authors has become con-
vinced of the desirability of tabulating a function allied to the complex Fresnel integral for
complex values of the argument. The tables given here are a partial fulfilment of this
requirement. There follows a brief description of the function, together with an indication
of the type of problem in which it will be useful.
