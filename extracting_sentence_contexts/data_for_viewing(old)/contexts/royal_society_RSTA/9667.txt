262 DR. Â©. CHREE: SOME PHENOMENA OF SUNSPOTS

There is a faint suggestion of a period of about 135 days, but if it exists its
amplitude is very small. :

The first subsequent pulse is not clearly shown in Table VI. before day 25, while
the first previous pulse clearly persists until day 24 if not day 22. Also the previous
pulse is not clearly shown until day 30, while the subsequent pulse obviously extends
until day 32.

The differences arise undoubtedly in the main from the fact already noticed in
connection with the 6-year period, that the first previous and subsequent pulses both
follow the primary in having the rise to the maximum more rapid than the subsequent
fall. The primary pulse itself in Table VI. is not clearly manifest until the second
day before the selected disturbed day, while it clearly persists until the fourth day
thereafter. But, in addition to this, there is at least a suggestion that the interval
between the crests of the primary and the first previous pulse is shorter than that
between the crests of the primary and the first subsequent pulse. This result is also
suggested by the 6-year data in Table IIT.

Even if we accept the figures as mathematically exact, a real difference in period
does not necessarily follow. The phenomenon may be a consequence of the diurnal
variation which undoubtedly exists in disturbance. Analysing the list of Greenwich
