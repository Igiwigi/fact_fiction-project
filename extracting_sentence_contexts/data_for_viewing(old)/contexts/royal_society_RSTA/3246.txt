a non-minimal coupling to the space-time curvature may have given rise to a higher effective
mass for the Higgs field, thereby preventing the growth of the fluctuations and preventing
the vacuum decay.

The fluctuations of the Higgs field could also have other effects. In typical inflationary models,
the inflaton field oscillates coherently about the minimum of its potential after the end of inflation,
until it has transferred its energy to the standard model degrees of freedom. These oscillations can
amplify the fluctuations of the Higgs field, either through a direct coupling or through their effect
on the space-time curvature [4]. This can lead to observable effects such as gravitational wave
production or even vacuum decay. If the Higgs field has a high amplitude at the end of inflation,
it can also have a similar effect on other fields.

In fact, it has even been postulated that the Higgs field could be the inflaton [1,3]. To give
rise to inflation, the inflaton potential has to be flat enough so that the energy density remains
approximately constant in spite of the expansion of the Universe. As such, the Higgs potential is
too steep for this, but if the Higgs field has a strong non-minimal coupling to space-time curvature
& ~ 10+, then the effective potential in the Einstein frame becomes flat at high field values [1,3].
In that case, inflation could actually be driven by the Higgs field and there would be no need for


a separate inflaton field. This scenario is known as Higgs inflation. It makes definite predictions
for the spectral index n, and the tensor/scalar ratio r, which are in good agreement with the
current CMB data. However, Espinosa [1] argues that the model suffers from unsolved theoretical
problems, especially the unitarity problem associated with a low cut-off scale. Garcia-Bellido [3]
discusses two potential ways around these problems: Higgs dilaton inflation and critical Higgs
