To account for these anomalous individuals the following suggestions occurred
to us :-â€”

1. EZ. esculentus and E. acutus, which are certainly closely related, might not be
distinct species at all, but two varieties of one species.

2. EH. esculentus and FE. acutus might be two separate species which varied towards
one another.

3. The intermediate forms might be natural hybrids between the two species.
Now, considering the ease with which the sperm of the one form will fertilize the
eggs of the other in the laboratory, and the fact that the two forms are found in the
same habitat, in the neighbourhood of Plymouth, and that their breeding periods
overlap considerably, there is no reason why hybridization should not occur. Rather
it is surprising that hybrids should not be found, as the cross-fertilization is so easy
to bring about in the laboratory, and the hybrids are quite as healthy as the pure-
bred forms. This does not apply, however, to the possibility of natural hybridization
between . miliaris and the other species, since the principal habitat of the former is
different. A priori, then, one might expect that hybridization would occur between
FE. esculentus and E, acutus in the English Channel, near Plymouth. We do not
know yet, however, whether hybrids between these species are sterile. It may be
that if crossing does occur the hybrid individuals die out after one generation, and
that by this means the two species remain distinct.
