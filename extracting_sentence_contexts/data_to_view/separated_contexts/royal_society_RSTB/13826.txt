A recent count study end, when a trade-off is found, may reveal how it acts (e.g.
on the importance of abiotic versus biotic factors explaining incorporating traits of the leaf and wood economics spectra;
range limits revealed that the warm end was indeed about see [27]). Candidate traits may then be screened for relevance

equally often explained by abiotic/temperature and biotic by studying trait clines across populations (or species) along


the gradient. In fact, many trade-offs reported in table 1 have
only been studied on this level so far. There is an important
caveat to such clinal studies; comparisons should focus
a priori on differences from the centre to each of the edges,
and not from edge to edge. The studies listed in table 1
showed that different trade-offs may be relevant at different
range edges.
