Gestures often consist of phases:
preparation (the hand moving into gesture space where the gesture
is to be performed), stroke (the most meaning-bearing part of the
movement), post-stroke hold (the hand is held still after the
stroke has been performed), and retraction (the hand withdraws
from the spatial location where the gesture was performed, often
moving back into rest position) [39,97]. For TCUs and increments
without a transition, we identified the movement phase at the
point of possible completion (i.e. at the end of the unit). However,
because transitions between speakers can occur well before (result-
ing in overlaps) or well after the end of the unit (resulting in gaps),
the gesture phase produced at the point of possible completion
may not in fact be the most relevant phase for the coordination
of the transition. For this reason, for TCUs and increments that
did have a transition, we measured the movement phase of the cur-
rent speaker's gesture at the point at which the transition began
(i.e. at the beginning of the next speaker’s turn which may precede
or follow the end of the current speaker’s TCU). For each TCU and
increment we thus categorized the temporal organization of the
current speaker's gestures as being in (i) a preparation or stroke
phase, (ii) a post-stroke hold phase, or (iii) a retraction phase, or
as being (iv) already completed.
