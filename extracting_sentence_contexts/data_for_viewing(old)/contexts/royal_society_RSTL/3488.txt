those in general use; and as the shortest pillars do not come within the simple rules
applicable to the longer ones, I shall adopt 1-7 in the future calculations as an ap-
proximate value of z, applicable to most of the pillars used in practice.


400 MR, HODGKINSON'S EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES

33. We ee from the preceding abstracts, that the values of x never rise 80 high as
two, but approach toward it accordingly as the breaking weight becomes smaller.
In the pillars *77 inch diameter and 604 inches long, where the length is seventy-
eight times the diameter, the value of x is 1'805 in one case, and 1843 in another ;
and in the pillars *50 inch diameter, and 604 inches long, the length being one hun-
dred and twenty-one times the diameter, the value of = is 1:914. These facts, and
the regular increase in the value of x according as the breaking weight is dimi-
nished, show that 2 is the value to which z would approximate if the breaking weight
were infinitely small, or the body perfectly incompressible.

Computations of the Strength of Long Pillars by means of the preceding Numerical
Results.

34. We have found that the strength of cast-iron pillars, whose diameter is the
same, is inversely as the 1:7th power of the length nearly; and where the diameter
differs, the strength varies according to a power of the diameter which is nearly con-
stant. This, in cylindrical pillars, whose ends are rounded, we have found to be
3-736, and in those with flat ends 3568, the pillars with discs upon the ends giving
