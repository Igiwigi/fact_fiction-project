The 24-hourly variation of terrestrial magnetism now takes the lead and as regards
westerly force is now 4'7 times as great as the semidiurnal variation, but the latter is
still too great for complete agreement with the facts, the observational ratio being 8°8.
This remaining discrepancy is not decisive against the accuracy of the assigned cause
in view of the uncertainty which attaches to the 24-hourly term in the barometric
variation as explained in § 4, and the considerations brought forward in the following
paragraph. ‘There is the theoretical possibility of a further increase in the diurnal
term through a velocity proportional to P,’; the motion specified by this potential
would give a barometric oscillation determined by the time of some definite meridian,
and though observations seem to indicate the existence of part of the oscillation being
of this nature, it is not likely that it is sufficiently great to produce a marked magnetic
effect.

12, A general review of the argument, even at the risk of repeating a portion of
what has already been said, may be appropriate, and is necessary to show how we are
