In the very late foetus the wandering
cells still show no granulation but there are now two kinds of cells present, one with
a round nucleus and one with a lobed nucleus. In the adult all these three types are
undoubtedly present. Thus we find a certain phylogenetic and ontogenetic support
for the statement that the very divergent elements of the sporadic mesoblast have a
morphological homogeneity in the fact that they have arisen from a primitive amoeboid
wandering cell with no specifie granulation, by a process of morphological and
physiological differentiation akin to that which has, pari passu, led to the increasing
complexity of the animal generally. &

Physiological. The question of the functional significance to be attributed to the sporadic mesoblast

Undoubtedly the wandering cells are present
largely as a protective mechanism to guard against the intrusion of foreign substances,
living or non-living, into the organism.
