MR. J. PRESTWICH ON SUBMARINE TEMPERATURES, 609

with a valve at each end both opening upwards, 80 that on going down a column of
water passed through. On arriving at the depth, and you commence hauling in, these
valves close, thus cutting off a portion of water at that depth, which was brought up
and tested for density and its then temperature. Indices read off both from maximum
and minimum scale and noted. But I have often found that the maximum index
8hifted, showing a different reading from what it stood at when started. Now w hether
this would affect the minimum side is a question.‚Äù

Captain PoeLLEN thinks not. But there are inequalities in some cases 80 apparent,
that they can hardly be accounted for, except by a shifting of the index. In one
instance, in fact, while the thermometer at 7890 feet indicated 41**, the index, owing
to rough weather, had shifted to 67* at a depth of 11760 feet. Captain PuLLEx speaks
also of some of the instruments being more regular in their indications than others.
After, however, eliminating those readings, which are evidently too high (marked with
a ? in Tables), the value of the other observations remains unaffected.

The Austrian Expedition of the * Novara * in 1857-60 f, under the command of
Admiral Von WULLERsTORF, made an extraordinary number of daily meteorological
observations, from which it is difficult to extract the few scattered notices respecting the
temperature at depths. Although they amount to 33 in number, they are mostly at
depths under 1000 feet, and none exceed 1500 feet. They embrace eleven observa-
tions in the Mediterranean to depths of not more than 760 feet.
