(13.7-8.1m) in the harbour [7]. One can understand how, with this huge concrete breakwater,
people in Kamaishi would feel well protected, and yet the 2011 tsunami caused 1253 fatalities in
the city.


Concrete seawalls and coastal dykes were covered with concrete at the front, top and back. 4 |
However, hard protection at the dyke toes was not mentioned. It was found in the 2011 event that

this lack of toe protection became a weak point, once overflowed. ar

At night on 12 July 1993, an earthquake off the west coast of Hokkaido generated a huge : a
tsunami. The southernmost area of Okushiri Island was completely devastated by the 11m ig
tsunami, even though the area was protected by 4.5m seawalls. This fact called for serious : s
reflection on the conventional method that was used after 1960 which relied mainly on coastal : 2
structures. Field measurements of extreme inundation are now used for validating numerical =

models [8,9].

In 1997, the Japan central government council, which consists of seven ministries, issued
a guideline for comprehensive tsunami countermeasures that should be taken as part of 18
regional tsunami disaster prevention. In those guidelines, three basic concepts of tsunami :
countermeasures were recommended: (i) building seawalls, breakwaters and flood gates to : =
protect lives and properties; (ii) urban planning to create a tsunami-resilient community through 3
effective land-use management and arrangement of redundant facilities to increase the safe
area, such as vertical evacuation buildings; (iii) disaster information dissemination, evacuation nee)
