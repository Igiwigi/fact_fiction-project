gated, even in a thin-walled form like Ditylum Brightwelli, the average cell diameter
of a population is bound to decrease progressively. The life cycle of centric diatoms
appears to consist of successive periods of reproduction by cell division and of formation
of auxospores. The diameter of cells developed from auxospores is twice to ten times
larger than that of the mother cells. The process of auxospore formation only occurs
when the cells have diminished to a certain size. When the cells have reached this size
they become capable of producing auxospores but need not do so. They continue to
divide, and for a considerable length of time environmental factors decide whether
and to what extent auxospores shall be formed. The cell diameter continues to decrease
until it reaches a minimum size and the cells either form auxospores or die.

In this respect the centric diatoms differ from the Pennatae (see p. 23). Another
difference is found in the fact that in centric diatoms the auxospores formed by cells
of different diameter show a great variability in size, whereas this is rather uniform in
pennate diatoms.

Cytological studies in Ditylum have produced some evidence in support of PERsIpskyâ€™s
views, that a reduction division and an autogamic sexual process precedes the forma-
tion of auxospores in centric diatoms. The observation of young auxospores of Ditylum
containing one big and two small nuclei especially strengthens the probability of the
occurrence of these processes in Ditylum. The possible interpretation of the stages of
reduction division described by Persinsky as preceding the formation of macrogametes
which need to be fertilized by microgametes or microspores (GEITLER 1932), was
eliminated by observations on cultures of Ditylum, Chaetoceros, Skeletonema and Melosira.
