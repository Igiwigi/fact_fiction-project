Visual inspection of radiographs indicated that this load was sufficient to open the cracks. The
displacement control mode of the loading rig was used to avoid any damage to the sample during
the long periods required for data acquisition. Despite the fact that the plastic tube (figure 3) has very low X-ray absorption, the composite
is also lowly attenuating with the result that the plastic tube affects the overall attenuation. To account for this, X-ray radiographs were taken of the sample within the rig to calculate an
exposure time that delivers approximately the same number of photons to the detector as when
the rig (tube) is not in place. Under strategy III, Rj and Rz were increased in balance to increase the phase contrast [19],
whereas the exposure time, t, was adjusted accordingly to maintain a similar number of counts, as
summarized in table 3.
