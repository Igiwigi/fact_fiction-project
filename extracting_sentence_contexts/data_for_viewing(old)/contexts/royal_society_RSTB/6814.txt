198 R. N. SALAMAN ON THE POTATO VIRUS “X”:

ACQUIRED IMMUNITY

In April 1933 the writer (Salaman 1933) published a note in which the phenomenon
of protective inoculation was described. At the time the discovery was made, viz. the
autumn of 1932, he was unaware that a somewhat similar phenomenon had been
described by Thung (1931). In an investigation on the nature of viruses and the
distribution of two or more infecting a plant simultaneously, Thung developed the
theory that one virus present in a cell might exert an antagonistic action against a
second invading virus so that the latter is refused entrance by the cell. In a paragraph
of which the following is a translation from the original Dutch sanctioned by himself,
Thung states: “That this is indeed the fact is shown when the virus of the common
mosaic (of tobacco) is inoculated into a plant (tobacco) already suffering from white
mosaic and the symptoms of the common mosaic fail to appear. Inoculations with the
sap of the twice infected plant reproduce only the white mosaic in healthy individuals,
showing that the virus of the common type is not present, even in a latent condition.
Similarly, plants affected by common mosaic fail to develop the white type on inocula-
tion. This, however, is not-an invariable result, for one does meet cases where inocula-
tions with white mosaic into plants already suffering from common mosaic, produced
the mixed pattern consequent on the action of the two viruses.”

These observations, which escaped general notice at the time, disclose fundamentally
the same phenomenon as that observed by the writer, hence to Thung belongs priority.
There is, however, a certain difference between the two observations: in Thung’s
