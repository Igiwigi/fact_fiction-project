We penetrate
one pentagon, then five more, and finally the core of a retrograde pentagram; thus the

total number of penetrations is Lae Sy
1+5—-2=4. Our dis not always equal to the E of Badoureau (1881, pp. 101-108), which is 8 for 3 | 3 5. In fact, dand E are different in all but the very simplest cases, such as those considered also
by Pitsch (1881, pp. 72-87), whose A agrees with both d and E. On looking through Schwarz’s list of triangles, we see that we have not considered the
apparently valid symbols

4|$4, 5/35, 5/34, $/35,

However, if we try to carry out the construction in these cases we merely obtain compounds
of familar polyhedra superposed in such a way as to have the same vertices and the same
edges, like the three coincident dodecahedra formed by ‘t{3, 5}’ (see the end of $5). These
compounds are listed in the first five lines of table 6 (on p. 431), with negative signs for com-
ponents having retrograde faces.
