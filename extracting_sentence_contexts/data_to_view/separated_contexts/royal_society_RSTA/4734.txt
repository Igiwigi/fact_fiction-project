Even more general possibilities are also available. More extended comments and discussions of possibilities in these directions, which apply—
and indeed, apply with more force—to the present proposal can be found in [2]. The fact that our
beables take the form of a generalized stress-energy tensor also suggests a possible new path to
considering the coupling of quantum theory and gravity, while avoiding the problems afflicting
standard semi-classical gravity [2]. Competing interests. I declare I have no competing interests.
