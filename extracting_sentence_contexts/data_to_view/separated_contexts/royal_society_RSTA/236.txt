It will appear that internal temperatures are only required at one time, in order to provide
initial conditions for the work, and that thereafter the time variation of temperature on the outside surface
of the mould alone provides sufficient data for the determination of the internal temperature distribution
and its variation with time.

Radiative heat transfer between two parallel plane surfaces has been considered by

Saunders (1929), Fishenden & Saunders (1932) and others, for general values of the emis-
sivities of the two surfaces.
