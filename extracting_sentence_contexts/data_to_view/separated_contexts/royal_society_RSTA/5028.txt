Hence, if temperature plays any part in moulding the
conditions by which changes in the resulting spectrum are brought about, the
spectrum of the atmosphere close to the photosphere will be different from that of any
higher region, and, therefore, from the general spectrum of the sun, which practically
gives us the summation of all the absorptions of all the regions from the top of the
atmosphere to the bottom. “ Now, as a matter of fact, we have the opportunity, when we observe the spectrum

of a sun spot or a prominence, of determining the spectrum of a practically isolated
mass of vapours in the hottest region open to our inquiries, and seeing whether it is
like or unlike the general spectrum of the sun. What then are the facts?..... The whole character of the spectrum of iron, for instance, is changed when we pass
from the iron lines seen among the Fraunhofer lines to those seen among the spot and
prominence lines; a complex spectrum is turned into a simple one, the feeble lines
are exalted, the stronger ones suppressed almost altogether.” *

One of the best examples of the changes of intensity of the iron spectrum brought
about by changes of temperature is afforded by the group of three lines at wave-
lengths 4918, 4919°8, and 4923'2 (Anasrrém’s scale).
