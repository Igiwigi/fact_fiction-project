64 PROF. W. J. SOLLAS ON THE SKULL OF ICHTHYOSAURUS,

exhibited in our Museums. ‘There is, indeed, an incidental advantage which this skull
possesses over those preparations, for its structure is revealed in detail by serial
sections recorded on photographic plates, and from these a surer knowledge,can be
obtained than from a mere inspection of a recent skull.

It is an esthetic pleasure to handle the skull unobscured by adventitious material
and set free as pure form. It is form alone that engages the attention of the
morphologist : the original material is of no account and the fact that it is lost in the
process of grinding down, blown in dust out of the window, need not give rise to any
regrets.

Those paleontologists who have acquired skill with the chisel have sometimes been
betrayed by their zeal for established procedure into contemptuous allusions to the
new method and have compared it with the “ shooting of a sitting hen,” yet, rightly
regarded, this is to proclaim its true merit, for science aims at assured results and is
anxious above all to eliminate sporting chances.

That which is fundamental in the new method is the process for obtaining serial
sections at any desired intervals; the reconstruction in plaster is only one of the
consequent results ; and here I would take occasion to mention that the reconstruction
