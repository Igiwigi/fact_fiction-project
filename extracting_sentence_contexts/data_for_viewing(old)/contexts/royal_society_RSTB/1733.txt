the outer sclerenchymatous layer is less developed and may appear merely as all
thick-walled epidermis (see Memoir XVII., in which fig. 6 should be compared with :
fig. 7). The form of these protuberances is somewhat variable; usually they are
bottle-shaped. Count Sortms-LAaupacnt speaks of them as winged ribs, an ex-—
pression which might convey the idea that they are longitudinal ridges, of which —
the figures cited show the cross sections. This, however, is not the case. The
petioles, it is true, are often somewhat winged on their upper edges, but such wings
are quite distinct from the emergences, which may arise from any part of the
surface. That they are not wings is shown by the fact that in a series of sections —
of the same petiole, their position never remains constant. Further evidence as to '
their real form is afforded by the fact that in longitudinal sections their appearance —
iv essentially the same as in transverse section (see Memoir XVIL., fig. 8), and also
by the fact that the cross section of the emergence itself is circular (loc. cit.). :

We have figured a peculiar form of these emergences, which is not unfrequently
met with (see Plate 23, fig. 12). The emergence has the usual thick-walled superficial —
layer ; its internal parenchyma is generally thin-walled, but near the free extremity,
there is a sharply defined group of well-preserved cells, with strongly marked walls
and brown contents. This group appears to be limited externally by a somewhat
flattened layer of cells. The structure certainly suggests a gland of some kind. In
several cases, even when there was no such well-defined mass of specialized cells,
the appearance of the parenchyma in the emergence is that of a tissue, which had —
been rich in cell contents. It is quite possible that a glandular function may have —
been discharged in certain cases by these emergences.
