The results speak view of goal-directed choice in terms of model-based reasoning
to the time course of engagement of different brain areas, (as opposed to model-free computations associated instead with
with an initial recruitment of posterior cortical areas, such as habits). It explores in detail the challenges of model-based com-
intraparietal sulcus, and a successive shift during choice pro- putations (e.g. their computational complexity) and advances
cesses to more anterior areas: ventromedial and_ lateral several proposals on how the brain might solve them, for
prefrontal cortex. The fact that additional signals emerged example by combining model-based and model-free methods
later in time in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex suggests that or using one or more approximations, also pointing to existing
this area might support post-decision action-selection rather evidence on the neuronal implementation of the proposed
than decision per se. These two studies, using different tech- computations. Friston et al. [27] explain goal-directed decision-
niques, are illuminating on the temporal dynamics of making within the ‘active inference’ framework.
