This occurred both in Â©. levis and
& M. vulgaris. The arrangement of the nerves in this portion of the body was found
= to be practically identical in the two species. The first spinal nerve in all cases
S issued by a deep notch (almost a foramen) at the base of the skull, and, in spite of
3 the fact that according to Rosenperc Mustelus is a genus showing vertebral con-
3 densation in this region, no variation could be detected. This was confirmed by the
a fact that the nerve denoted by y was always found below and slightly anterior to
& the posterior margin of the vagus foramen (Plate 13, fig. 1). Hence the first spinal
could be determined with certainty, and afforded a fixed point from which the
position of the pelvic girdle could be reckoned.
