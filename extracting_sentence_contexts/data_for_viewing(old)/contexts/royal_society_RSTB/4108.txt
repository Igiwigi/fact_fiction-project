Now, when one comes to look into all this, it is seen to be a somewhat important
result. One may, so it seems to me, draw from it two or more conclusions, the
first of which is that the local endemic species have not been—as I have already
shown in other ways in other papers—developed in any kind of advantageous response
to local conditions, as must have occurred did natural selection obtain.

Had this been the case, one might reasonably have expected them to be on the
whole, at least, as common as the species of wide distribution. But by no conceivable
argument can this be maintained. TRrimen doubtless made errors in his estimates,
but there is no reason to suppose that he always gave the widely distributed species
the preference to the others in the direction of commonness.* The mere fact that
the figures come out in such remarkable arithmetical progression is sufficient to show
this, and the fact that the local endemics increase in number down to Very Rare,
instead of up to Very Common (as do the species of wide distribution), is enough
to show that the endemics were not developed in advantageous response to local
conditions.

A second great argument in favour of this contention is that the species common
to Ceylon and Southern India, 7.e., species which must, on the whole, have been
developed before the separation of those two countries, and which must therefore,
on the whole, be older than those endemic to Ceylon only, are more common than
the latter. If we imagine that they were all developed in Ceylon, and spread
subsequently to South India—a purely gratuitous assumption—we might then
say that they had been developed to suit the Ceylon conditions, and, being older, had
had more time to spread, and thus become commoner. But, unfortunately for this
