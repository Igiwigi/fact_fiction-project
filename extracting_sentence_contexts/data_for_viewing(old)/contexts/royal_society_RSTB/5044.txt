tooth are laid down one after the other. These differ from the first or primordial “ cone ”
in having a double origin, 7.e., in arising from two separate rudiments, one of which is,
as a rule, slightly in advance of the other (fig. 14, b-e). These rudiments develop into
lamellee.

Since Devanesen (1922) started with a comparatively late stage, he was naturally
unaware of the fact that, in H. miliaris, the first “ cone’ differs from all succeeding
ones in having a simple origin. As all subsequent ones are formed from a pair of lamellie,
he writes, ‘‘ one may therefore reasonably infer that each of these five (primordial) cones
also arises in the same way from a pair of lamelle,” and these he termed the “ pair of
primordial lamelle.’’ The larger lamella of the second “ cone ” almost equals the first
“cone” in length in advanced Kchinoplutei (see fig. 14, e, also Plate 11, fig. 1 given by
DeEvANESEN). This, together with the fact that the two lamelle of “ cone” 2 are still

’

far from fusing might have suggested that the first “‘ cone ”’ is either simple from the
beginning, or, if double, the lamellae must fuse very early. Besides this, he cites THiet’s
paper (1892), and he must have been aware of the fact that Tuer describes the first

“cone ” in the tooth of Hchinocyamus as arising from a single “ tetrahedron.”
