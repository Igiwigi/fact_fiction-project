A similar remark applies with equal
justice to the consideration of the variations of the magnetic elements. Jn the Annual
Variation now before us, even a very cursory inspection is sufficient to show, that as
the same months occupy positions on opposite sides of the mean line at different
parts of the twenty-four hours, the mean Annual Variation, or that which is shown by
the mean values in each month taken from al/ the observation hours, must be merely
a residual quantity; and that consequently natural features must be more or less
masked in deductions in which only mean values are brought into view. In fact,
as has been shown in the published volumes of the observations at St. Helena and
Hobarton, the mean annual variation at those stations is 80 small as to be scarcely
sensible, more particularly at Hobarton, where its whole range amounts to not more
than a small fraction of a minute of arc. But when we resolve these mean results
into their respective constituents, viz. the Annual Variation at each of the observa-
tion hours, there is then at once disclosed to us an order of natural phenomena,
