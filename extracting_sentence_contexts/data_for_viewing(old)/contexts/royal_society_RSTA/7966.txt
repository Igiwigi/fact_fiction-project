and many of their alloys. Such explanations as have been afforded to explain the
ductility or otherwise of metals and other crystalline substances have rested on the
form of the atomic arrangement rather than on the spacing of the atoms or unit
dimensions of the lattice.

In this respect there is a distinct difference between iron, which has the body-centred
form of cubic structure, and nickel, copper, or aluminium, which have a face-centred
cubic form of structure. This fact, however, does not prevent iron having excellent
ductility at ordinary temperature. For atomic structure to be at the root of the
question, it is necessary, therefore, to suppose that closer approach of the atoms can,
on the one hand, in some way destroy ductility, and, on the other, improve it.

The matter is, too, further complicated by the fact that manganese steel, which has
the same face-centred cubic structure as all those other metals and alloys which still
retain considerable ductility in liquid hydrogen or even improve, is rendered brittle.
That the presence of rather a high carbon content, 1-27%, is not in some way inter-
fering, and preventing the face-centred structure from showing its true characteristics
is demonstrated by the following tests specially made to determine this point.

The material for the tests was an alloy, 1879H, containing 0-20% carbon, 0-70%
silicon, and 38-9°/, manganese, and chosen from the series of alloys whose properties
were recorded in a paper by one of the authors.* _‘ This alloy is remarkably tough,
and being of the austenitic or face-centred cubic type of structure like manganese steel,
but with a low carbon content, it lent itself especially well to an examination of the
present question. Frémont shock tests on notched specimens were made on this alloy
