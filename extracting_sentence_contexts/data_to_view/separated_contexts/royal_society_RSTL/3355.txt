The outer scolloped line in similar cases has no doubt
been often mistaken for the outer margin of the fibrille. It is, in fact, indicative of
the bulging sarcolemma, which is bound down to the prominent extremities of the

intervening fluid. Now in this specimen the interior of the fasciculus is in focus ; a
central row of corpuscles is there een, and the view of the margin thus represented
is, in fact, such as would be obtained by a horizontal section. This fasciculus is thus
proved to present on its surface a series of transverse grooves, to which the sheath
does not adhere, and in which a fluid is collected. It seems doubtful whether the
attachment of the sarcolemma to the prominence of the snccessiye discs be 80 com-
plete as to isolate the intervening grooves from one another.
