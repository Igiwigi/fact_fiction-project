combination.

The Rothamsted field experiments have indeed now been continued long enough to
afford some pertinent examples bearing upon this subject.

Thus, in the case of the fields under continuous wheat, continuous barley, alternate
wheat and fallow, and continuous root-crops, the average annual yield of nitrogen in
the crops with mineral, but without nitrogenous manure, has only been about or
under 20 lbs. per acre (= 22Â°4 kilog. per hectare); the amount has declined to less
than the average in the later years, and, coincidently with the continuous and
diminishing growth, the percentage of nitrogen in the surface soil has been
considerably reduced. The loss by the removal of even such small crops, together
with that by drainage, has, therefore, as a matter of fact, not been compensated by
free nitrogen brought into combination, either by the plants, or within the soil.


QUESTION OF THE SOURCES OF THE NITROGEN OF VEGETATION. 105

Tn a field where the leguminous crop, beans, had been grown 25 years out of 32,
with mineral but without nitrogenous manure, and had yielded less than average
agricultural crops, the percentage of nitrogen in the surface soil was also greatly
reduced.

In another field, where the leguminous crop, red-clover, had been sown 12 times in
30 years, the clover failed many times, the yield of nitrogen in the crops very greatly
