q = M2 = Np = exp (—G,/2kT), n, =1—2y,.... (76)

Now the proportion of step sites from which the evaporation energy is W is represented by
q+n,. We obtain again a formula of Frenkel type with an energy of formation w = 44,
which is extremely small, much smaller than in the case of the (0,1) step. At higher tem-
peratures, for which 7, ~ 1, we obtain

1-1 2 =m
~ 21497? n, = $(1—7}), i ae sayeth (77)

It can now be seen why we have gone to the trouble of considering second nearest neighbours;
we have done so in order to obtain the correct behaviour at low temperatures for the
directions near (1,1). In fact for low temperatures (77) becomes

independent of temperature.

14:2. Free energy of steps

It is of interest to evaluate the configurational free energy of a straight step. Using
standard methods ( = kln W, F = U—TS, etc., W = number of ways in which kinks can
be arranged in a step) we obtain the following general expression for the edge free energy
per molecule:
