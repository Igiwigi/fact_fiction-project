The facts here stated are incompatible
with the expression of the symbols of the units of the binoxide of nitrogen and of the
tetroxide of nitrogen respectively by an integral number of prime factors, on the hypo-
thesis that the symbol of hydrogen is expressed as « [Part T. Section VIII. (2)]; for we
cannot find, on that hypothesis, any positive and integral solutions of the indeterminate
equations connecting the integers, which are the indices of the prime factors by which
these symbols are expressed. Now if this be regarded as a true statement of the facts, it must be allowed that the
binoxide and tetroxide of nitrogen are not only (what indeed, perhaps without excep-
tion, they are) the most curious of all chemical substances*, but are absolutely unique
objects not made in the same way as other things, or turned out of the same workshop
with them ; in short (as I before said) they must be © chemical monstrosities,” © lusus

* LavgexrT endeavours to get out of the difficulty by drawing a distinction between the molecule and (what
T haye termed) the unit. The unit, he says, is indeed NO, but the molecule is Ny O,. As, however, a mole-
eule can only be defined by referring it to the unit and saying that in all cases two units of matter are consti-
tuted of an equal number of molecules, this explanation is not very satisfactory, although it is a path in which
LavkenT has been contentedly followed by the greater number of chemists.
