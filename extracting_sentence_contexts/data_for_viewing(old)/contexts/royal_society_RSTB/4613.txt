nouvelle, tout en ayant la poche intestinale trés développée et bourrée de Protozoaires,
suffirit d’ailleurs & écarter lidée d’une castration parasitaire.”

My own observations and those of previous investigators make it very nearly a
certainty that the presence of Protozoa, in the hind intestine of Termites, is correlated
with a ligneous diet. In the young larvee, and in the kings and queens, which
receive a fluid diet from other members of a colony, no Protozoa as a rule are to be
found. It is, furthermore, noteworthy that these forms do not partake of ligneous
food at all. In the older larvze, soldiers, workers, and sometimes in the winged sexual
forms, Protozoa are abundant and ligneous diet is the rule. Another significant
feature which argues against the theory of “castration parasitaire” is the fact that
intestinal Protozoa have sb far only been found among members of the families
Protermitidee and Mesotermitide. The members of these families are wood-feeding
forms. Among the higher Termites Protozoa have not so far been discovered, and

moreover these forms do not partake of a purely ligneous diet. In Ceylon BuGNnion
mentions (1914, p. 46) having found intestinal Protozoa in the following genera :
Hodotermes, Calotermes, Leucotermes, Glyptotermes, Coptotermes, Arrhinotermes, and
Termitogeton, all of which pertain to the Protermitide or Mesotermitide. In the
