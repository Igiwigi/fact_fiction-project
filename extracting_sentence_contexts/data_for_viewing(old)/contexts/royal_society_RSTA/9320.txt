do so to the same extent. The amount of salt which entered the flame in the present
experiments was rather greater than in the earlier experiments, for solutions of equal
concentration.

The present experiments on the variation of the conductivity with the concentration
can be explained in a satisfactory way on the ionic theory, and they confirm the view
that all salts give negative ions, having equal velocities in the flame.

The fact that K,CO, does not diminish the luminosity due to Na,CO, seems to show
conclusively that the luminosity is not due to positive ions. The K,CO, increased the
number of negative ions about nine times, and, therefore, must have diminished, the
number of positive sodium ions in the same ratio. That the negative ions from
K,CO, do combine with the positive ions from Na,CO, is shown by the fact that the
conductivity of a mixture of sodium and potassium carbonates is less than the sum of
their separate conductivities as it should be according to the ionic theory.

In conclusion, I wish to say that my thanks are due to the trustees of the Rice
Institute for the facilities for experimental work which they have provided.
