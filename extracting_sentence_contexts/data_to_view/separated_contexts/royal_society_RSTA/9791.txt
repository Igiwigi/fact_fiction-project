Brooks suggested that water vapour might be an essential
factor in the production of the hydride spectrum,* and the experiment on the are in
hydrogen was accordingly repeated, with a quantity of phosphoric anhydride intro-
duced into the globe. After standing for 24 hours, however, the flutings appeared
at once on striking the are, as in previous experiments, and with undiminished
brightness. In fact, the absence of water vapour would seem to be sufficiently
indicated by the absence of the oxide group 5007. Subsequent experiments made by
Mr. Brooxst have similarly led him to conclude that the presence of water vapour
cannot be regarded as an essential condition for the production of the hydride
spectrum.
