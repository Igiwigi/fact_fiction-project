We have seen that the time T’ of fictitious transit is given by

T’=T+8T+ 5Mcosg + SNsing,


PROFESSOR G. H. DARWIN ON TIDAL PREDICTION, 187

and that (y —y)T +h—-—l=q7 where /, and / correspond to the time of fictitious
transit. Now
L =h-+ 2e,sin (J, — 281°),

where e¢, is the eccentricity of the sun’s orbit, and 281° the longitude of perigee. Also

l= yp +l.
