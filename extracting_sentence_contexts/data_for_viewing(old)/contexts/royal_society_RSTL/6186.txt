then will 3(T,+T,) be the mean temperature of the radiating surface during the expe-
riment, and R,â€”R, will = the rise in the temperature of the calorimeter during the
obseryed time of the experiment, expressed in the number of beats of the watch. The
time was usually taken longer or shorter, according as the rise of the thermometer of the
calorimeter was slower or faster. Five hundred beats corresponded to 3-333 minutes.

It will be observed that in each of the experiments (1), (2), &c. in each series 1., TE
&c., the temperatures of the radiating surface are approximately equal. These experi-
ments, (1), (2), &., are in fact repetitions of nearly the same experiment, made with the 2
view of obtaining the mean rexult of several experiments instead of relying on the result
of one. And here I may remark that this was necessary, not merely for the elimination
of errors of observation, but also for that of the actual irregularities in the rising of the
mereury in the thermometer of the calorimeter. Moreover no high temperature can be
maintained perfectly stationary, but is always in a state of oscillation about a mean value.
If every experiment could be made eract, the numbers registered in the fourth column
of the following Table ought to be the sgame, The irregularities which they present are
partly due to the slightly different temperatures (as exhibited in the second and third
columns) at which the experiments were made, partly to the causes just mentioned, and
partly to the necessary errors of observation. All these irregularities may manifestly
be more or less eliminated by taking the mean result derived from a number of similar
experiments. For this purpose I have taken the mean ('T) of the tabulated values of
