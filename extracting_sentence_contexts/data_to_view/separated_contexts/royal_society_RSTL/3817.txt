According
to these views, each nerve is formed of four sets of fibres, two of which, derived from
the primary structures of the cord, the ganglionic and the aganglionic, which are
traceable to the brain, are supposed to minister to volition and sensation : the other
two, the fibres of reflected action, are the commissural, which communicate with those
on the opposite side of the body, and those of reinforcement, which, independent of the
brain, connect distant parts on the same side of the body. The ganglia of the cord
are regarded not only as analogous, anatomically, to the enlarged portions of the cord
in Vertebrata, but physiologically as centres of reflexion, agreeably to the views of
Dr. CareeNnTER; and they also possess a $till more important character and function
in the nervous system, that of being the centres of growth and nutrition to the cord
and nerves, the nuclei contained in them being perhaps the sources of supply and
nourisghment. This is shown from the fact that, in these parts, the fibres of the cord
are 8ofter and larger than in the rest of their course ; and are elongated during the
growth of the body, and the development of new segments ; as is seen in the Polydes-
mide and Geophilide, families from the two divisions of Myriapoda. These additional
facts fully accord with the already ascertained mode of development by extension, or
simple growth of the segments. 2.
