A direct comparison between the results of : g
atomic and continuum theory could then be made. 8s

The analogy between atomic and continuum level is nearly perfect for these solutions, except
for one curiosity. That is, the atomic-level solutions of OMD allow all possible discrete groups
of isometries, whereas the continuum-level analogue described here requires Abelian groups. Evidently, this is related to the use of deformations in continuum mechanics, and the fact that the
associated conditions of compatibility used heavily here are fundamentally related to the Abelian
process of getting the same answer by taking different paths to the same point.

(b) Perfect atomistic interfaces

In ยง4, we used the idea of objective structures to generate energy-minimizing bent and twisted
configurations of a material (e.g. TisoNi4go.75Pdg,25) exhibiting perfect interfaces between austenite
and single-variant martensite. In ยง5a, we noticed that the resulting configurations have the same
structure as exact solutions of the equations of molecular dynamics generated using the theory of
objective structures.
