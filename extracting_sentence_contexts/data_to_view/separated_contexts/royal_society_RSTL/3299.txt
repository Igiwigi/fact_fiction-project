The substances to be submitted to experiment, are formed into rings as
at R, fig. 11; in these the bar is caused to oscillate. Each ring is about one
inch in height, of any convenient thickness, and 4.75 inches interior dia-
meter, 80 as to admit of its being accurately adjusted on the cylindrical
shoulder of the circular base, fig. 10.

minute and transient magnetic forces, it seems essential to keep in view the
following interesting fact ; viz. the influence of bodies, not snsceptible of per-
manent polarity, on the state of oscillation is such, that the amplitude of the
vibrations only is diminished, not their duration : that is to say, whether a
bar vibrate in free space, or otherwise near plates, or in rings of these sub-
stances, still the number of oscillations in a given time, considered as a unit of
time, does not yary, although the bar is sooner brought to rest when under the
influence of such bodies, than when freed from them, whatever substance be
employed, and at whatever distance the influence be exerted. This fact seems materially to distinguish the peculiar influence of non-mag-
netic substances, from a case of permanent polarity ; by which last, an oscil-
lating bar is not only brought to rest in less tine, but the rate of vibration is
very sensibly increased. We cannot therefore, as in the latter instance, resort
to the common law of pendulums, and take the square of the number of oscil-
lations performed in a given time as a measure of the force in action, since
the time of each oscillation does not sensibly yary ; we must therefore adopt
some other method.
