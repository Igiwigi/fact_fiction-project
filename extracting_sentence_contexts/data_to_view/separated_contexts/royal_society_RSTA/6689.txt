Assuming first that the bar is
distortionless, and that, as shown in the table, £ = 2:28 x 10-5cm., V = 0-0525 V, E, = 193 V,
equation (5-16a) then gives D = 5-60 x 10-?cm. Assuming next that dispersion modifies _
the (é/£5, 2t'/T,) curves as shown in figure 33 and that the duration of the pulse due to the
impact of the ball is such that 27”/7, = 0-04, this diagram shows that the mean value of E/E,
at the end of the pulse is about 1-03. This does not affect the value of é used in equation
(5-16a) since this value is deduced from the momentum communicated to the bar by the
impact of the ball; on the other hand, it does affect the total change in capacity, 7, of
the bar condenser and the maximum p.d., V, across R, and C, of figure 4. 7 is, in fact,
proportional to the average value of ¢ at the end of the pulse in figure 33 (see equation
(5-8) and V, in turn, is proportional to 7 (see equation (5-5a)). Thus the value of P appro-
priate to the present case is 0-0525 x 1-03 = 0-05408 V, and substituting this value of v,
together with the values of £ and E, already given, in equation (5-16a), it is found that
D = 5-51 x10-*cm., compared with its previous value of 5-60 x 10-?cm. Thus curve (a)
of figure 33 leads to a value of D which is about 2%, less than the value corresponding to
the case of a distortionless bar, and since displacement and pressure are proportional to D?
(see equation (5-106)), other quantities remaining unchanged, it follows that the values
of € and p deduced from the lower value of D will be about 4%, too small.
