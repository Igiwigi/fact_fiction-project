It is therefore only when they are basking that their presence becomes
known, and since they bask only when the weather conditions are suitable it is possible for
large numbers to be present some depth below the surface and yet for them to be entirely
overlooked. A calm sea and bright sunny weather give the optimum conditions for seeing
the fish. Although large numbers of Cetorhinus are seen close inshore during the summer
they are by no means entirely absent in the winter; in fact, the earliest attempts at a
scientific description of the anatomy of this fish were made with sharks captured in the
English Channel in November and December (Home 1809, 1813; de Blainville 1811). A male fish 28 ft. 10 in. long was stranded off Shanklin Chine, Isle of Wight, in February
1875, and its skin was purchased by the British Museum (Hadfield 1875); a recent record
is of four Basking sharks seen off the Argyllshire coast near Cambletown on December 18
(Anon, 1948). The sex ratio of the fish in the commercial catch is peculiar, females being very much
more plentiful than males.
