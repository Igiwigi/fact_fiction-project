This result is generally interpreted today to mean
that nothing with a non-zero rest mass can travel as fast as light (in a vacuum). Searle studied
the electromagnetic effects of moving charges for decades and accepted that conclusion, but
Heaviside never did. Scattered all through his books, in fact, are analyses concerning charges
moving faster-than-light (FTL), with the earliest dating from 1888 [24]. This caused Searle much
frustration as, for example, when he wrote in his 1896 paper ‘Mr. Heaviside has stated the result
when u is greater than v [the speed of light], but has not up to the present divulged the manner
in which he has obtained the solution in this case’.
