Only on its north side can the approximate limits of the whole deposit be
gauged at present with any degree of certainty, though even here its lower limit has not
yet been reached. On the other hand, in spite of the deceptive appearance presented
by a septum-like mass of fallen limestone in the upper part of the deposit, Layer 3,
fig. 30, it is perfectly clear that the original top of the formation has been destroyed by
past erosion, for the cave deposits without doubt extend above what had earlier been
alluded to as the “collapsed roof” (TxruHaRD and Youne, 1930), and attain
to the actual present surface of the hillside above. A striking indication that the
Choukoutien fissures have been strongly eroded since the complete formation of their
contained deposits is afforded by the fact that a layer of extremely hard travertine,
1 metre in thickness capping the very summit of the hill just to the south of the Main
Deposit of Locality 1, is full of the bones of Chiroptera, fig. 30 and Plate 6. A whole
superstructure of dissected limestone, now no longer existing, must at one time have
existed in this place in the past, in order to explain the presence here in such a situation
of this stalagmitic Chiroptera-bearing mass.
