n6v6 into glacier, is perhaps the grandest illustration of the same principlef. It has
been, however, suggested to me that the sticking together of two pieces of ice may be
an act of cohesion, similar to that which enables pieces of wetted glass, and other similar
bodies, to stick together. 'This is not the case. There is no sliding motion possible to
the ice. When contact is broken, it breaks with the snap due to the rupture of a sohd.
Glass and ice cannot be made to stick thus together, neither can glass and glass, nor
alum and alum, nor nitre and nitre, at common temperatures. I have, moreover, placed
pieces of ice together over night and found them in the morning 80 rigidly frozen toge-
ther, that when I sought to separate them, the surface of fracture passed through one of
them in preference to taking the surface of regelation. Many sagacious persons have
also suggested to me that the ice transported to this country from Norway and the
Wenham Lake may possibly retain a residue of its cold, sufficient to freeze a thin film
enclosed between two pieces of the substance. But the facts already adverted to are a
sufficient reply to this surmise. The ice experimented on cannot be regarded as a
magazine of cold, because parcels of liquid water exist within it.

44. Nevertheless, as our present knowledge of the facility with which ice permits

* 16 is here implied that the contact of the moist surfaces must be 80 perfect, or in other words, the
liquid film between them must be 80 thin, as to enable the molecules to act upon each other across it. The
extreme tenuity of the film may be inferred from this. A thick plate of water within the ice would facilitate
rather than retard liquefaction.
