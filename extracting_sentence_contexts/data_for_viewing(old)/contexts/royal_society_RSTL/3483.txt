This result is very singular, inasmuch as the chlorine compound contains less oxy-
gen than that from which it had been formed, and also that two equiyalents of ery-
throlitmine are inyolyed in the decomposition which fixes one of chlorine. This may

be, however, in great part explained by the fact, that at the same time with the chlor-
erythrolitmine there is produced another body, soluble in water, but which I have not
yet obtained in a form proper for analysis. On this soluble substance I consider the
oxygen lost by the chlorerythrolitmine to be fixed ; and although it has not as yet been
analysed, an idea of its probable constitution may be formed, if we consider it to be
produced as follows :
