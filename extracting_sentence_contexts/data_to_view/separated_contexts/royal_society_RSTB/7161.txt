only a few larvae within the cocoons of YX. brasiliensis (table 14)
pupated; but many pupae showed signs of growth, and adults emerged from a very few
at the former humidity. In X. cheopis there was a comparatively better growth of larvae
and pupae within the cocoons, as is indicated by higher percentages of ultimate pupation
and advanced pupae formed at 80, 90 and 100% r.u. A fairly high mortality occurred
within the cocoons that contained the larvae about to undergo metamorphosis; this is
borne out by the fact that there was a very high pupation within the 1-day-old cocoons of


618 M. SHARIF ON THE EFFECTS OF

X. cheopis, that only contained the resting larvae; whilst a very large number of larvae died
in the prepupal stage within cocoons 2 or 3 days old, which contained many larvae ready
for the metamorphic change. A low percentage of pupation within the cocoons of
X. brasiliensis was due to this cause. The fact that in both these species growth occurred in
a much higher percentage of the pupae than of the larvae shows that the developmental
thresholds of pupae are lower than those of larvae; this is corroborated by slightly lower
theoretical developmental thresholds for stages within the cocoons of these species, being
11-83° C in X. cheopis and 11-63° Cin X., brasiliensis.
