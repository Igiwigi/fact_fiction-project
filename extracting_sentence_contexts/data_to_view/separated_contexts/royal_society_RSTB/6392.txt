Then
they gradually left the shell and lived in the surrounding medium until the strong
contamination with bacteria made an end of them. These observations offer an example of how various flagellates might be mistaken
for microspores or microgametes. The possibility that some of the microspores described
were in fact parasites has been often discussed (GEITLER 1931 ; FRrTscH 1935). Where the
formation of microspores was preceded by nuclear divisions of the diatom cells (GRAN
1902, 1904; KARSTEN 1904, 1907; BERGON 1907; SCHILLER 1909; HorKER 1928) the
simple assumption of parasitic infection is clearly unsatisfactory. My own observations point to the possibility of interpreting the great diversity
exhibited in the observations of various authors with regard to the formation, the

ultimate shape and the supposed fate of the microspores as being due to two phenomena:
(a) an abnormal division process similar to that found in Chaetoceros didymus and Ch.
pseudocrinitus (p. 33), resulting in the formation of a number of small naked cells within
the parental shell; (4) the occasional presence and reproduction in dead diatom cells
of flagellates not necessarily of parasitic nature.
