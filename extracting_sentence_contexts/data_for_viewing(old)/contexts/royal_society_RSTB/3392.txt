delicate chemotaxis at work is not an illegitimate but is indeed a reasonable
supposition.

In dealing with human beings, as with all animals in which only a small proportion
of the ova contained in the ovary come to maturity, we are dealing with animals
whose ovarian ova are subject to a struggle for existence, with animals in which
selective action goes on in the ovary. Histological examination demonstrates that
for some reason or other one ovum will degenerate while its neighbour thrives,
and it seems probable there are a variety of forces which may exert influence in
this respect.

I have drawn attention to this in my paper on the rabbit's ovary (1905), and it is
a very important fact, for, in extending to the ovary influences which bear upon
selection and the struggle for existence, forces are introduced which must profoundly
affect not only its power of production but also the proportionate production of ova
of different constitution. Thus, this factor will not only bear upon sex but also upon
every hereditary constitutional variation which is directly associated with the vigour
of the ovum, and may after all in such case be natural selection.

Russo, in the paper already referred to (1907 A), and in a more recent one (1908),
shows how eagerly ovarian ova seize upon specially nutritious food. He used lecithin
for the purpose, and it would appear, from the figures he gives, there is a distinct
variation in the capacity of different ova for the absorption of this food. Whether
this variation in the power of absorbing nutriment is a sexual characteristic or not
he does not satisfactorily show ; indeed, the histological evidence he offers leads me
