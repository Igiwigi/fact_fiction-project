range of systems for which Sg and Sg are non-equivalent.

(a) Self-consistency checks : =

The question as to whether Sg or Sg are viable candidates for the thermodynamic entropy 3
of isolated systems can be answered directly by testing either candidate against the laws of :
thermodynamics. The approximation-free analysis in [8] shows that for a broad class of physical areal
systems, which includes all standard classical Hamiltonian systems’ of arbitrary size, the Gibbs ae
volume entropy Sg satisfies the traditional formulations of the zeroth, first and second laws a]
exactly. By contrast, the surface entropy Sp is found to violate these laws in many situations [3,8,9]. DN
While referring the reader to [8] for technical details, we briefly summarize the most essential aes
results. :&
(i) That Sc, but not Sp, satisfies the zeroth law is a reflection of the fact [8,10,11,15-17,21] that ,

only Sg satisfies the microcanonical equipartition theorem exactly. More precisely, denoting the
microcanonical averages by (-)z, the Stokes theorem implies [11] that, for all standard classical
Hamiltonian systems with topologically simple phase space R“, the equipartition identity*

holds for any of the canonical coordinates (&1,...,€4). By contrast, this relation is in general violated
for the surface entropy, ruling out Sp as a consistent thermodynamic entropy.
