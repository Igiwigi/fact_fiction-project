We have also denoted

G:uu =| ds | dyG(x — y,t — s)u(y, s,
0 00

where G(x, t) = — 3 4x8(x, t). On this basis, the following representation can be derived as in [47,48]

&[6] =[ex (Jue —v)-utvu-G:uu}dx — Atul) B[v]D[vyP[ul, (4.3)

where A[u] denotes an unknown functional to account for possible breakdown of classical
solutions and J = det(5it/du). In fact, we can confirm that J =1 as in the 3D incompressible case. We also have A[u] =0
because the Burgers equation is globally well-posed. Hence we find

P[o]= ] exp Gita —v)-utv-G:uu} dr) [v]D[v]P[w]. (4.4)

This formula connects the characteristic functional 6[v] of the heat equation with that of the
Burgers equation ®[@].
