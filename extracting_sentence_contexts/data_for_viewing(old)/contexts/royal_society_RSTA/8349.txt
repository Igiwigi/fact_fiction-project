ruled surfaces [ containing c, and cs, these surfaces themselves generating the locus
M,*. Now M,* meets I in the two quadric conical surfaces projecting c, from O, and
O,; and to these surfaces correspond two lines of F,* lying in o and meeting in O.
This point O, then, is the unique double-point of F,*. Thus the reverse system 1s
composed of Segre cubic primals through a rational ruled Fy‘, and through the plane of the
two generators through its single node.

Degeneration of V,°.—Any line of w corresponds to a cubic ®-curve on 1; and since
the line meets /, twice and k, three times, cubic ®-curves must meet c, twice and ¢,
three times. Hence the planes corresponding to points* of c, form a quadric cone V,°,
and those corresponding to points of c, form a cubic locus of planes V,. V;°
is in fact the quadric cone projecting F,‘ from O; and the planes of it in question
meet I’, in cubic curves having nodes at O. ‘The planes of V,? are just those which
meet I’,* in conics ; each of them also meets o in a line ; and any two of them meet on
s, i.e., Vz* has o as double plane. As before, any line of = meets two planes of V;*
(of the system in question) and three planes of V5*, such that the five planes so obtained
form a set of five associated planes.

Properties of the Transformation.—Any line of 8 meets M,‘ in four points and II once,
and any ‘’-conic in = therefore meets F,* in four points and so once. Toa line meeting
¢, corresponds a line meeting both F and oc, while to a line meeting c, corresponds a line
bisecant of F. Now let us apply the reverse transformation to a V," of = which has
F,* as r-fold surface and o as s-fold plane. The order of the transformed primal, the
number of points namely in which it is met by a line, will be equal to the number of free
