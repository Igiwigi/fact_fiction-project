An attempt is made to correct this in fig. 2, where the
horizontal distances are meant to represent geographical distances. How to open out
the scale on the sides is a matter of judgment, but the amount of enlargement is
based on the fact that the mean temperature shown along any even kilometre height
should coincide with that giv@n in Tables IT. and III. The distance across may be
taken roughly as 1000 miles. Fig. 1 obviously fails in this respect ; it is only meant as a representation of the
facts disclosed in the tables previously given.
