Now we know the diameter of the channel before the first layer was put on and
also the diameter of the first layer ; they were respectively

49:565 and 49-728 centims,
From this we find
t=:-0815 centim.
and finally

A=25753 centims. The observations on coil B gave the same value for the thickness of the wire and
covering, and we get for it

a=25'766 centims. The method here adopted to determine the value of the mean radius allows for the
fact that in winding one layer may sink 80mewhat into the one beneath. Let the figure (fig. 3) represent a section of the coils by a vertical plane through

the axis ; let the coils be placed with their lettered sides down as in the figure. This
we call position 1 throughout.
