The work of determining the magnetic susceptibilities of the
various rocks collected was undertaken by Prof. Ernest Wuson, of University of
London, Kingâ€™s College. The geological examination of the district was greatly facilitated by the fact that
the whole area had recently been re-surveyed by the officers of H.M. Geological
Survey, and the results of their investigations shown on the Geological Maps and
Memoirs (list on p. 94). It was thought desirable that a series of observations should also be made on some
known sheet of iron-ore with a view to determining the character of the disturbances
caused by the sheet.
