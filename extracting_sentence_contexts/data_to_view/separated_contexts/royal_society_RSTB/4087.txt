This being so, there
are two possible alternatives as to their mode of origin and growth. In the first
place, only a few of these bracts are found, and they are somewhat delicate in
structure, their bases are not seen, but must have been quite thin; we may then
suppose that in exceptional cases a few sterile bracts were produced in a loose fashion
on the peduncle just below the microsporophylls, their points of attachment being
very narrow and leaving no scar. A second and more probable explanation is that they were of the nature of bud-
scales

and, in fact, their general form is identical with that of the bud-scales of the
Horse-Chestnut. They may have been produced more particularly round the bud
from which the flower grew, but of which we at present know little, since a flower has
not yet been found in connection with a main stem. Leaves.—It has already been pointed out that the remains of the flowers which
