Ni & Markenscoff [15] showed that ee and we do not contain logarithmic terms if singularities

of O(Ine/¢) are excluded in the governing equation. We will integrate (using MATHEMATICA) the pseudo-momentum —(0/d#)(t/ju;,¢) ina multi-
scale contour from radius ¢” to per unit thickness in the y-direction (figure 1)

which is due to the fact that the dislocation is 1/r singular at the core. It may be noted that the
same result is obtained for transition between scales (e"~!, e", n > 2); if it is across multiple orders
then the effective mass is increased accordingly. It can be shown by calculation that the value of change of pseudo-momentum in the volume
obtained in equation (2.6) agrees with the flux of the pseudo-momentum through the surface of
the contour in figure 1, consistent with the conservation equation (2.3), as the contour does not
contain a singularity.
