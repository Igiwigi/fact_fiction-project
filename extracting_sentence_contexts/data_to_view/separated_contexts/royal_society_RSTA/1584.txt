Each throw was then altered by the oscillation by about the same amount,
and their difference divided by 2 was consequently the correct value of R so far as
error due to the oscillation was concerned. Of these two methods of eliminating the oscillation error the second is obviously to
be preferred, but it is, unfortunately, not always available. For while it is of primary
importance that the oscillations be small, this fact limits the range of possible tilting of
the helix to an angle so small that it does not always include tilts for which the helix
effect is sufficiently large. Tn our earlier work the method of reading to the centre of the superposed oscillation

was used, our aim being to keep the helix effect low so that the positive and negative R

effects were more or less equal on opposite sides of zero; and it was not until we

encountered a specimen, which for some reason refused to be adjusted unless the helix

effect was large, that we came to realise the value of this condition. Since then, as it
has happened, we have been able to use the second method in all our work.
