equation under a more general form. The curve © may intersect the given curve in a
system of points P', each p times, a system of points Q', each g times, &c. in «ach manner
that the points (P, P'), the points (P, Q!), &c. are pairs of points corresponding to each
other according to distinct laws; and we shall then have the numbers (a, «, #'), (b, , (').
&c. corresponding to these pairs respectively, viz. (P, P') are points having an (, «')
correspondence, and the number of united points is =a; (P, Q') are points having a
(B, B') correspondence, and the number of united points is =b, and so on. The theo-
rem then is

pla—z—s)+q(b—B—Þ')+ &c. + Supp. =24D,
being in fact the most general form of the theorem for the correspondence of two points
on a curve, and that which will be used in all the investigations which follow.

103. Investigation of the number of double tangents. Take P' an intersection of
the curve with a tangent from P to the curve (or, what is the same thing, P, P' cotangen-
tials of any point of the curve): the united points are here the points of contact of the
several double tangents of the curve; or if © be the number of double tangents, then
the number of united points is =2r. The curve © is the system of the »—2 tangents
from P to the curve; each tangent has with the curve a single intersection at P, that is,
k=n—2; each tangent besides meets the curve in the point of contact Q' twice, and in
(m—3) points P'; hence if (a, «, «) refer to the points (P, Q'), and (27, B, Þ') to the
points (P, P'), we have
