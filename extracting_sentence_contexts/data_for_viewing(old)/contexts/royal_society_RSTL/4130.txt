eastern occurs one hour earlier than in May to September, and the western one hour
later than in October to February : these peculiarities, both in regard to direction and
to hours, are traceable without difficulty to the occasional alternation in those months
of the influences of the opposite seasons.

Fig. 3. Plate IV. exhibits in the unbroken line the mean diurnal variation of the
whole year at Toronto, and in the broken line the mean variation of the whole year
at Hobarton in Van Diemen Island, showing the contrast which the opposite hemi-
spheres present in this respect. In like manner the broken and unbroken lines in
fig. 4 present in contrast with each other the diurnal variation of the opposite $easons
at St. Helena. By the comparison of figs. 3 and 4, the general resemblance is shown

* The fact that October corresponds much more to November, December, January, and February than to
May, June, July, and August is very decided; and is important to notice, because, although the sun passes to
the south of the equator in September, he continues to the north of the parallel of St. Helena until the begin-
ning of November. It is the sun's poxition in reference to the earth's equator, therefore, and not to the zenith
of the place of observation, which marks the epoch of the change in the direction of the diurnal variation of
the needle.

seasons in the other, whilst at the same time the snbordinate points of dissimilarity
are equally conspicuous. It is not the object of this paper to enter on the discussion
