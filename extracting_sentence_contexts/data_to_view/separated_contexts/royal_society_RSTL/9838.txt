Independent of the peculiar arrangement of cells and disposition of the layers in
this region, a characteristic feature is acquired in the presence of two arciform stripes
of medullated fibres, disposed as in the modified upper limbic cortex, one above the
second layer and the other immediately beneath the same. They will be more
minutely described in the section on the central projections of the olfactory lobe. F or
the present it will suffice to bear in mind the important fact that both these modified
occipital regions of the great limbic lobe are characterised by the double 8tripe of intra-
cortical arciform medulla, and by the dense granule belt of the one, as contrasted with
the great inflated cell formation of the second layer in the other.

Extra-limbic mass—Having now completed the examination of the great limbie
lobe, I have next to consider the greater portion of the hemisphere which lies external
to the constricting limbic are, or that portion which in higher animals enters into the
formation of a frontal, parietal, and tempo-spheroidal lobe.
