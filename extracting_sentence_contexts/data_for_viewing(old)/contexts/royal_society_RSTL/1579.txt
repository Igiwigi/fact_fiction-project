Havine on a former occasion laid before the Society some
experiments, to prove that fluids pass directly from the cardiac
portion of the stomach, s0 as to arrive at the circulation of
blood without going through the thoracic duct, the only known
channel by which liquids can arrive there ; the present expe=
riments are brought to confirm that opinion ; but in stating
them, I wish to correct an error I was led into, in believing
that the spleen was the channel, by which they are con-
veyed.

At the time I made my former communications, I was con-
scious that the facts-I had ascertained were only sufficient to
open a new field of enquiry ; but as I might never be able to
make a further progress in an investigation, beset with s0
many difficulties, I thought it right to put them on record.
Since that time I have lost no opportunity of devising new
experiments to elucidate this subject ; and the circumstance of
Mr. BRonts, the assistant of my philosophical as well as pro-
Tessional labours, having tied the thoracic duct in some expe-
riments which will come before the Society, suggested to me
the idea, that if the thoracic duct was tied, and proper experi-
