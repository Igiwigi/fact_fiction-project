The magnitude of the partial eclipse varied across the UK, from approximately 85% in southern
regions, up to approximately 95% in the north. Over the UK, the times of first contact, eclipse

maximum and fourth contact were approximately 0830 UT, 0930 UT and 1040 UT, respectively :2
(throughout this article all times are in UT). Atmospheric observations during prior eclipses : =
have demonstrated that the prevailing meteorology can be perturbed by the rapid changes in 3
insolation associated with the propagation of the eclipse penumbra through the atmosphere [1]. : =
In fact, it is known that eclipses significantly affect each layer of the Earth’s atmosphere, from DS
the troposphere to the ionosphere, and a large volume of research has been published on this : S
subject, as reviewed elsewhere in this issue by Aplin et al. [2]. Focusing on eclipse-driven 3
meteorological changes, the two most pronounced and readily understood effects are the large : =)
decrease in short-wave solar radiation, which can be almost 100%! for total eclipses [3], and : Ss
a corresponding decrease in air temperature, which can be several kelvin. However, there are is

also more subtle and complex features in the meteorological response.
