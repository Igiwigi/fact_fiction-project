doubt that the Wititamson fragment and the actual cone belonged to the same
species, especially if we take into consideration their identical dimensions, and the
fact that they occur in the same deposit. In all probability the fragment is the peduncle of a cone. â€˜This is suggested by the
exactness of the agreement in many points of structure and in dimensions, and espe-
cially by the fact that the leaf-bases of the fragment are so closely similar to the
sporophyli-bases of the cone.
