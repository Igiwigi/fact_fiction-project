The other identities constantly employed are:

(y&) (Pay) = Xi, j,£,, (PP’E) 1S, = 9,

(w’é) inte = 36,(ing), bn Sp Mp Cpr =0,

tgigiytg = —3(iEn) (i6C),
where 7, 2’ are a pair of equivalent symbols cogredient with u, and /, p’ are a pair of
equivalent symbols cogredient with x.

3. Until van der Waerden succeeded in reducing six of the forms given by Ciamberlini
it seems to have been regarded as obvious that the complete system of a number of ternary
quadratics should be self-dual. In fact, the symbolic forms present themselves for con-'
sideration in reciprocal pairs, obtained from each other by interchanging x with u and
i with i. It so happens that none of the processes of reduction actually carried out by earlier
writers had ever involved the splitting up of a symbol p into its components f, p’; thus such
reductions as were carried out applied equally to either of a pair of dual forms. But the
forms of Ciamberlini reduced by van der Waerden are actually the duals of irreducible
forms. Thus failure to reduce a form does not necessarily imply failure to reduce the dual,
and we shall see below that many of the forms involving bracket factors such as (pqr) or
(pqx) are reducible when their duals are irreducible. It is therefore pertinent to remark
that a reduction which does not involve the splitting up of a symbol p at any stage is equally
applicable to the dual form, whereas if a symbol p is split up in the course of reduction the
dual form needs separate consideration. It may be remarked, in parentheses, that it is the
reductions of this latter type which are usually the most complicated.
