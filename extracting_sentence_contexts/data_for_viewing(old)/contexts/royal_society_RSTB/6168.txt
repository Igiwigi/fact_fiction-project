and add that leaven of conscious appreciation and intelligent direction so
characteristic of higher mammals.

The name “ Pars Intercalaris Encephali’’ expresses well the topographical and
physiological position of this region.

The diencephalon, as seen from the exterior, is very large, figs. 1 and 2. Its
bulk is due chiefly to the enormous hypertrophy of the ventral nucleus of the
thalamus which projects caudally in a large “ pulvinar” reminiscent of that of Pri-
mates. That this “ pulvinar ” is homologous in part with that of Primates is a rather
astonishing fact which depends, however, not upon the intrinsic size of the pulvinar,

but upon the great expansion of the ventral nucleus. This is further empha-
sized by the relation of this “ pulvinar” to the mid-brain. A true pulvinar—as
seen in Primates—is an expression of the enlargement of the higher physiological
levels of the thalamus, and it projects caudally dorsal to the tectum, But in Echidna
the projection is lateral to the mid-brain and is due, not to the size of the higher
physiological level, but to the hypertrophy of the lower.

At the caudal border of the “ pulvinar,” and in the course of the optic tract, is
