Chlorine, bromine and iodine,
convert the base into substitution-products, in which the basic character of the ori-
ginal atom has disappeared ; of these the bromine-compound is distinguished by its
splendid appearance, crystallizing as it does from alcohol in long magnificent orange-
yellow needles. The iodine-compound, too, is very beautiful ; it forms either on addi-
tion of iodine-s0Jution to the base, or on evaporating a solution of the iodide exposed
to the action of the air. In fact it is difficult to avoid the formation of this substance
in recrystallizing iodide of tetrethylammonium. Cyanic acid yields with the base a
crystalline compound, a sort of urea, which is remarkable for its composition, inas-
much as it may be viewed as ordinary urea, in which the four equivalents of hydrogen
are replaced by ethyl. I hope to communicate shortly a full account of these several
substances.
