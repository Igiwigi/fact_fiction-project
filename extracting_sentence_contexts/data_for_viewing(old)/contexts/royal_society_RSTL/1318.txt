W :rmw a $hort time after the discovery of columbium by
Mr. HaTonetT in 1801,* a metallic substance was also dis-
covered in Sweden by M. ExtBER6, differing from every
metal then known to him ; and accordingly he described the
properties by which it might be distinguished from those which
it most nearly resembled. But although the Swedish metal
has retained the name of Tantalum given to it by M. Exzsers,
a reasonable degree of doubt has been entertained by che-
mists, whether these two authors had not in fact described
the same substances ; and it has been regretted that the disco-
verers themselves, who would have been most able to remove
the uncertainty, had not had opportunities of comparing their
respective minerals, or the products of their analyses.

As I have lately obtained small specimens of the two Swe-
dish minerals, tantalite and yttro-tantalite, from which I could
obtain tantalum, and was very desirous of comparing its
properties with those of columbium, Mr. HaTcnerT very
obligingly furnished me with some oxide of the latter, which
remained in his possession.
