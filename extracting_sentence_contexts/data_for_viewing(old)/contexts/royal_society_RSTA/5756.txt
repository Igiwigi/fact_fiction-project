root-mean-square error of 0.1 mm in the course of the detecting of artery boundaries. It means that
an average diameter of the modelled artery of 3mm, the mean relative accuracy in determining
the boundaries is about 3.5%—4%.


The three-dimensional model of the coronary artery has been created mainly according to the
data obtained in one angiographic projection (LAO 1°). The second projection was used to test the
hypothesis on the symmetry of artery cross-section. According to the data obtained (figure 3), the
middle line of the blood vessel was created in one plane. Undoubtedly, to increase the accuracy
of the vessel midline preparation, additional projections are necessary (e.g. [61]).

Methodologically, the contribution of side branches of the main coronary arteries to the results
of modelling was not considered in this study. At this stage, we were guided by the fact that the
side arteries were small in diameter (less than 1.5 mm) and could not contribute much to the DB or
LAD hemodynamics. Meanwhile, the contribution of side lateral arteries is certainly an important
issue that needs detailed investigation. Also, as mentioned above, we neglect the influence of
several external processes affecting the flow hemodynamics and model parameters. In particular,
we neglect the elasticity of the vessel walls, their stretching/narrowing due to a number of
regulatory mechanisms, the chemical composition of the blood, its compressibility, a possible
disorder of the stability of the laminar flow, etc. The impact of these aspects on hemodynamics is
an important task for future research.
