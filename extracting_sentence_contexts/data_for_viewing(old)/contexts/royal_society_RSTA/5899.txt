critical points are indicated by vertical lines in figure 1. : =

Notice that the two transitions are of distinct nature. The analytical results of equations
(3.10), (3.18) and (3.19) suggest two distinct critical exponents 8. One of them is related to the
behaviour of the magnetization near the critical point p,j = 1/4, ie. we have f = ising = 1/2. This
transition is a usual ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition. Indeed, we obtained a paramagnetic
(disordered state) solution, equation (3.12). In addition, we can observe in figure 1 the usual
finite-size effects for numerical results regarding ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transitions
for values of m near p=pz,j. On the other hand, for the second-phase transition observed for p
at Pp = Pca = 1 â€” 3w/g, the analytical results suggest an active-absorbing phase transition, since the
critical exponent is 8 = Bcp = 1 [45]. Indeed, we also obtained an analytical result f,1 = fo =f_1 =0,
see equations (3.7), (3.8) and (3.9), i.e. it is the absorbing state where p = 0. In this case, the fraction
of active agents needs to be zero even in the computer simulations, which in fact we observed (see
the red stars in figure 1b).

Figure 2 shows additional results for m and p for g=1 and typical values of the deactivation
probability w. In figure 2a, we exhibit the curves for m and p for w =0.2. As previously discussed,
the maximum value of the magnetization decreases for increasing values of w, as predicted by
equation (3.17). In addition, the second critical point pca decreases its value and becomes near
the first critical point p,j. One can also see from equation (3.19) that both critical points pg and
Pca coalesce for a given value of w. Taking pei = Pca, we obtain that such a value of w is given
by w= rs For the special case g=1, this equation gives us w= 0.25. For this value we have
Pci = Pca = 1/4, which is exhibited in figure 2b. The other result, w=0.3 suggests that there is
a critical value of the deactivation dynamics above which there is no phase transition, and the
system is in an absorbing state for all values of p. This critical value w, can be obtained from
