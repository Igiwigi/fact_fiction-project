INTRODUCTION

he subject of this paper is the simultaneous ideal theory of a pair of integral domains R
jand S =>, of which & is integrally closed, and G integrally dependent on R. It is assumed
at the quotient field L of G is a finite separable extension of the quotient field K of R. The
device of quotient rings effects a preliminary simplification in many of the proofs; the
quotient rings R, and G,, with respect to any existent multiplicatively closed set S of non-
ero elements of R, also satisfy the above basic postulates for R and G. Another method of
preliminary simplification, valuable in the discussion of ramification theory, is the ad-
junction of Kronecker indeterminates. Such indeterminates (algebraically independent
over K) are denoted by y or z; in connexion with the regular representation of L, they are
sregarded as adjoined to K. This method is expedited by the known fact that R[y,, ..., ¥,,]
and S[y,, ...,Y,] also satisfy the above postulates for R and G. In particular, R[y;, ..., y,,]
is integrally closed, and the degree of L(y, ..., Y,,) over K(y, ..-; Ym) is equal to the degree of
L over K. Integral domains satisfying the conditions imposed on ® and GS are of common
occurrence in algebraic geometry; the resulting interplay of geometrical and ideal-theoretic
ideas makes such cases of outstanding interest.

The main results of this paper are given in Part I. The investigation is modelled on the
well-known theory of the ‘classical’ case when § is an integrally closed domain in which
the (maximal and) weak minimal conditions for ideals hold. The simpler theory of the

discriminant- and different-ideals, complementary modules, and norms, is assembled in
