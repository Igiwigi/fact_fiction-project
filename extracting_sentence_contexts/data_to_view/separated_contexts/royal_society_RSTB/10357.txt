Experimental manipulations could compare pheno-
typic selection, reaction norms, neutral and functional genetic
diversity of closely related endangered and invasive species in
several different environments to better understand evolution-
ary potential and constraints. Endangered (or at least rare
native) species that are invasive or spreading elsewhere
would be particularly useful study systems to investigate in
this way. One potential obstacle to developing such a framework is
the fact that researchers investigating invasive and endan-
gered species rarely collaborate—indeed the authors of this
paper work primarily on invasive species and as a result
our discussion is more heavily weighted towards this area. Nevertheless, we hope that this review will encourage
better communication between these two fields. After all,
the goals of conserving endangered species and preventing
invasions both require a comprehensive understanding of
the evolutionary and ecological factors that affect population
persistence in a changing world.
