possessions in India, Ceylon, and Burma.

For the study of zoological distribution there are few, if any, regions on the
earth’s surface that exceed British India and its dependencies in interest. The area
is large, nearly 1,800,000 square miles, and although the vertebrate fauna is by no
means thoroughly explored, it is well known throughout the greater part of the
area, and fairly well throughout the whole; better probably than in any other
tropical and sub-tropical tract of approximately equal extent. The variety of
elevation and of climate is remarkable ; the country is bounded on the north by
the highest of known mountain ranges, and by the loftiest plateau on the earth’s
surface, and it includes within its limits both the almost rainless area of the Sind
Desert, and the locality in the Khasi Hills distinguished by the heaviest rainfall
known. Another element of interest is the fact that the Peninsula of India is a
land of great geological antiquity, there being no evidence to show that it has ever
been submerged, although the greater part of the Himalayas and Burma have at
times been beneath the sea.

The object of the present contribution to zoological geography is to determine the
divisions into which the Indian Empire can be classed by our present knowledge
of the vertebrata, and especially to ascertain the zoological relations between the
Indian Peninsula and the neighbouring countries. After some consideration I have
come to the conclusion that the object in view can be best carried out by a review
of the distribution of genera ; families and sub-families alone being too few in number
and ranging in general over wider tracts than genera do, so that it is difficult to
determine subregional divisions by means of them, whilst species are too numerous
