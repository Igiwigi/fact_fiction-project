twice or thrice in succession.

(e) Section is not the only way in which blocking of waves may be cansed in contrac-
tile strips. I find that pressure, even though very gentle, exerted on any part of a
strip causes a blocking of the waves at that part, even after the pressure has been
removed. If the pressure has been long continued, after its removal the blocking will
probably be permanent ; but if the pressure has been only of short duration, the blocking
will most likely be transitory. Even the slight strains caused by handling a contractile
strip in the air are generally followed by a decrease in the rate of the waves, and some-
times by their being completely blocked. Other methods by which the passage of
waves in contractile strips admits of being blocked will be alluded to further on.

(f) Such are some of the facts I have been able to collect bearing on the question
concerning the physiological character of the general contractile tissues of the Medusz.
That these facts are of a somewhat paradoxical nature is evident ; and whether or not
there is any theory by which they admit of being satisfactorily reconciled is doubtful.
1 may say, however, that I think there is such a theory, and that I only refrain from
publishing it at the present time because I think that at this early stage of the inquiry
it is desirable, as much as possible, to avoid speculation.
