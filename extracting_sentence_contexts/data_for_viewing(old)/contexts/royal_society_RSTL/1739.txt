ferent parts of the globe, with different pendulums, be strictly and directly
comparable with each other. It is true that we have two pendulums, in form
and construction totally different from each other, whose results have been
closely compared : viz. Borpa's pendulum, and KarTer's convertible pendulum.
But, although the great accordance in those results, by two such different
means, evince the talent and skill of the distinguished persons engaged in
making the experiments ; yet it should now be borne in mind that the reduc-
tions to a vacuum were, in both cases, made agreeably to the old formula :
and that, since M. BzsstL's important investigations on this subject, which
indicate the necessity of revising the computations of all preceding experi-
ments, no rigid comparison of the results has yet been repeated. 'The amount
of the additional correction, for the two respective cases, varies materially, as
T shall more fully show in the sequel : so that we are, in fact, at the present
moment, totally ignorant whether the results of any two pendulums that haye

ever yet been constructed, are in strict and reasonable accordance with each

other. And until this is practically accomplished, and can be practically re-
peated, I do not think that the true length of the seconds pendulum can be
considered as satisfactorily determined.
