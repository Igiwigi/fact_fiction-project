Viz. it is

V'=3. In fact the form of the surface in the vicinity is given by w= —E #444 3.

viz. there are two sheets osculating along the line in question, that is intersecting in
this line taken 3 times.
149, For the cuspidal curve we have

| 12w*, 420, 3+4aw |=0,
| 4zw, 9*+4aw, —120% |

giving
12zw +39 —4x=0,
360% +4waz+y*% =0;
or multiplying the first by 3z and subtracting the second, we have 1084*%+42%=0. Henee the equations are
2+27w*=0,
12vw+34*—42*=0,
