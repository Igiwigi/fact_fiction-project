has no basal cell, and the suspensor is present. In face of these facts the position of
the Ophioglossaceze requires reconsideration. It is necessary to note that Cerakovsky’s thesis does not specify the genus
Lycopodium, nor even the homosporous forms, but simply the “ Lycopods,” a term
which then included the Psilotaceze and also the heterosporous Jsoetes ; on the other
hand, it leaves out of account the Sphenophyllez as being an extinct group. But
these all take their place between the homosporous Lycopods and the Ophioglossacew,
in our present view, on grounds of comparison of the sporophyte.
