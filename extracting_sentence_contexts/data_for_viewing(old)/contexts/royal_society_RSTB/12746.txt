result of a collusion between the two—Hamilton pressured
Nature [1] into either publishing Price’s paper [4] or risk
wAg = cov(w,g) = cov(W + Aw,g). losing Hamilton’s own contribution [21], in a move that
seems unlikely by today’s standards. The derivation I present
here nevertheless owes the most to Queller [16], who derived
this now widely known ‘general’ model of kin selection—

w=W+(w-W)=W+Aw.

Substituting this into the first term of equation (1.1) we get

Making use of the distributive property of covariance, we
