If any such correlation exists it has been obscured by other variable
factors in these experiments. It may be concluded that up to the stage with ‘P, medium’,
I, is undetermined, since it can be displaced by an operation which does not touch its
presumptive area. The fact that the displacement does not exceed 25° in these experiments
may be due in part to the cutting down of P, as suggested above; it is also possible that
after the centre of P, was removed, some of its influence still persisted in the apex as a
residual inhibition at the time when J, was determined. I
