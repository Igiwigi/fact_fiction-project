are roughly the same. That this is in fact the case has also been observed numerically in [5].

(b) Coherent backscattering contribution

A second class of correlated pairs of trajectories are those shown in figure 2, namely y’=Ty,
where T denotes time reversal. For Bose-Hubbard systems, time reversal is achieved by complex
conjugation, such that the time reversal of a solution @(t+ tj) of the equations of motion is
(te — t)*. Of course, these pairs exist only if the Hamiltonian itself is time-reversal symmetric,
which for a Bose-Hubbard system corresponds to a real Hamiltonian. It turns out that a Bose—
Hubbard chain with nearest neighbour hopping only is always time-reversal symmetric, because
it can be transformed into a real one by multiplying each component of the wave function by a
certain time-independent phase. In the same way, for certain combinations of the phases of the
hopping parameter in a Bose-Hubbard ring, the Hamiltonian can be transformed into a real one.
