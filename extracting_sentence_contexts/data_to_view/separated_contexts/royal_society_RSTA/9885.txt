It has a
considerable intensity, inasmuch as it withstands dilution to a far greater extent than
the band under discussion ; it is the eighth band. Furthermore, a ninth band has been photographed, which apparently corresponds
to the ninth group of vapour bands measured by Frreprrrcus (see p- 493). That six, and not seven, bands have generally been referred to as the characteristic
feature of the benzene solution spectrum arises from the fact that six bands appeared
to be similarly constituted, that is to say, each of them was sharpest and strongest at
the more refrangible side, and became gradually weaker and less well defined on the
side towards the red, but in the seventh feeble band this constitution was not evident. The greatest importance has always been attached to the four strongest bands,
because, as already intimated, they are of similar intensity and constitution, and occur
at approximately regular intervals. Moreover, there are similar groups of four bands
in the spectra of naphthalene and anthracene (â€˜ Trans.
