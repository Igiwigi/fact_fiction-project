are 5% and 30%, the influence of the earthâ€™s magnetic field being less for the higher
frequency. We notice that the discrepancy between the electron density for which the
direction of group-propagation becomes horizontal and the electron density for which
the direction of phase-propagation becomes horizontal is less marked for the extra-
ordinary wave than for the ordinary wave. This can be connected up with the fact

that the critical electron density required to reflect the ordinary wave in the case of
vertical incidence at a magnetic pole differs from what it is in the case of vertical inci-
dence at the magnetic equator, whereas the critical electron density required to reflect
the extraordinary wave is the same in both cases. The branches of the (g, x) curves in figs.
