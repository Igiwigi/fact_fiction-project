Ahâ€™(0) an Ar(0) were taken the same

for each #3 as for Mj = 10, and an y was taken as proportional to .@] (it is certainly 0 for

.#? = 0), and on this basis the quantities (15-4) were evaluated for @? = 0 and 20 and inter-
polated linearly in .@} for other values. This is certainly not accurate, but even if slightly
incorrect values of the quantities (16-4) are used the only result is that a few more trial
solutions have to be made before the criterion given by the sign of (16-3) is satisfied, and even
ifsix trials have to be made instead of two, this only adds 2 min. to the total time of obtaining
a final solution, whereas evaluating the quantities (16-4) from three (or five) preliminary
solutions for each value of .@?, and punching and verifying a card for supplying these data
to the machine would take longer than this, and the alternative process of working out an
addition to the machine set-up to evaluate the quantities (16-4) from such a set of solutions
would take longer than the aggregate time taken by the few additional solutions needed on
account of the use of inaccurate values of the quantities (16-4). So the apparently crude use
of approximate values of the quantities (16-4) is in fact the most efficient. This, of course,
is a result of the high computing speed of the ENIAC and the short time which it takes to
evaluate a single trial solution. An example of the results of this process is shown in table 1.
