The cervix comprehends the remaining portion of the
cornu as far forwards as the level of the central canal. This distinction is grounded
on the facts,â€”1, that in ascending the medulla oblongata, the part which I designate the
caput cornu is thrown aside from the rest, as a distinct mass which is traversed in
succession by the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves, and then becomes the principal
nucleus of the sensory root of the trifacial; and 2, that, independently of the gelatinous
8ubstance which surrounds it, it differs in structure from the cervix, or remaining part of
the cornu, which, in the medulla oblongata, supplics the grey substance of the posterior
pyramid and restiform bodyF. This distinction is not only consistent with anatomical
facts, but will be the means, I think, of adding clearness and precision to the description
of these parts. The caput cornu posterioris varies in form in different regions of the cord. Tn the
upper part of the cervical region it is long and pointed, or pyramidal; broader and more
rounded in the lumbar enlargement and in the conus medullaris; and again pointed,
or somewhat pyramidal, through the whole of the dorsal region in Man (e fig.
