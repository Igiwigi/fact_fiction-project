1902, vol. 39, p. 564), a result that is most easily explained by supposing that the
acetone acts merely as a solvent, but is not able to bring about heterolytie con-
duction. The task of distinguishing between autolytic and heterolytic conduction is greatly
facilitated by the fact, which is brought out very clearly in the curve showing the
intrinsie conduetivity of sodium hydroxide at different concentrations, that whilst
heterolytic conductivity rises to a maximum in the most dilute solutions, autolytic
conductivity is greatest in the most concentrated solutions. The existence of
autolytic conductivity affords, therefore, a simple explanation of the increase of
molecular conductivity with concentration that has been not infrequently observed. Two examples of this kind were recorded by Euxer (‘ Zeit.
