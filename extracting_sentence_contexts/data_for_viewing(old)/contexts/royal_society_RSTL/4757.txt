character, by variations in its physical conditions of temperature and condensation
or rarefaction (2780.), and at the same time subject to these physical changes in a
high degree, by annual and diurnal variations, in its relation to the sun, without,
being persuaded that it must have much to do with the disposition of the magnetic
forces upon the surface of the earth (2796.), and may perhaps account for a large part
of the annual, diurnal and irregular variations, for short periods, which are found to
occur in relation to that power. I cannot pretend to discuss this great question with
much understanding, secing that I have very little of that special knowledge which
has been accumulated by the exertions of the great and distinguished labourers, Hum-
BoLDT, HANSTEEN, ARaGo, Gauss, SABINE, and many others, who have wrought 80
zealously at terrestrial magnetism over the surface of the whole earth. But as it has
fallen to my lot to introduce certain fundamental physical facts, and as I have natu-
rally thought much upon the general principles which tend to establish their relation
to the magnetic actions of the atmosphere, I may be allowed to state these principles
as well as I can, that others may be placed in possession of the subject. If the prin-
ciples are right, they will soon find their special application to magnetic phenomena
as they occur at various parts of the globe.

2848. The earth presents us with a spheroidal body, which, consisting of both para-
magnetic and diamagnetic substances, disposed with much irregularity as regards its
large divisions of earth and ocean, are also equally irregularly disposed and inter-
mingled in its smaller portions. Nevertheless it is, on the whole, a magnet, and, as
far as we at this moment are concerned, an original source of that power. And
