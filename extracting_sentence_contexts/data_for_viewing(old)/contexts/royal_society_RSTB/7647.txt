is no tuberculation, but S. arabicum is much more involute and has a groove on the venter.
It is also distinguished by the same characters from the more involute S. gignouxt Roché
(1939, p- 196, pl. iii, fig. 1), which is also non-tuberculate and comes nearest. I have no
doubt that it was a specimen of S. arabicum that was figured in H. Douvillé’s pl. i, fig. 9,
from Sinai.

Buckman’s figure (1927, vol. vii, pl. dccliv) of the holotype of 8. paululus shows a groove
on at least part of the venter.

S The style of ribbing is closely comparable with the Caucasian form figured as S. rectelo-
a batum Hauer by Neumayr & Uhlig (1892, pl. v, fig. 5, pl. vi, fig. 2), but in that there is no
= ventral groove and the ribs on the nucleus are stronger and more distant; that it is not the
= same as S. rectelobatum Hauer is shown by the fact that the ribs (pl. vi, fig. 2) are still
B enlarging and becoming more distant although septation has not ceased.
