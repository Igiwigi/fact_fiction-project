Willis-like
depolarizability) for the behaviour observed in (A 3). Asa final corollary, an apparent Willis coupling effect could inadvertently be introduced where
it does not genuinely exist, through a specific decomposition of Bot OF Peg to recover the form of
(A7). This is due to the fact that uniqueness is not present in any homogenization description, in
the absence of additional constraints. For the purposes of comparison, we present the scattered
field profile @s- and scattering efficiency Qsc for the resonator geometry considered in Melnikov
et al. [15] in figure 7. Here, we observe relatively strong enhancements in both the scattered field
and scattering efficiency at the Helmholtz resonance ky, as expected, and only comment that
there could be room for obtaining a stronger response through an optimization search of the type
considered in figure 3d.
