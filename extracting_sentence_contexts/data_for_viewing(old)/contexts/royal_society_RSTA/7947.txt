In this section it is proposed to refer to several matters which do not call for exhaustive
discussion. The first of these is the isotope effect. This may be resolved into two com-
ponents, one vibrational and the other rotational. The former has already been studied
by several workers, and has provided the basis for the allocation of vibrational quantum
numbers, but the present work affords the first opportunity of examining the rotational
efiect. The bands of the less abundant isotope, although showing fairly well-marked
heads under low dispersion, are somewhat difficult to trace on the grating plates. It was

only possible to identify the Q branches of the v’ = 1 progression with any degree of
completeness ; and even these could seldom be followed close up to the origin. It was
verified that the isotope displacements followed the usual laws* ; in fact, their calculated
values were employed as a rule to assist in the identification. Beyond this it did not
appear possible to derive any useful results from these data ; in particular, it was not
possible to determine the mass ratio} Cl” : Cl°* any more accurately than it is known
already.

In view of the accuracy with which the constants had been evaluated it seemed to
be opportune to test various relationships between them which have been proposed from
time to time. These are enumerated in Jevons’ “ Report,” pp. 27-29.

The first three are as follows :—
