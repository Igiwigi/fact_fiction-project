If the change of form caused by the compres-
sion were not borne in mind, these piles of concave plates would seem not to have
been adapted to the alveolus, and might thus be made occasions for the revival of
the exploded idea of Dg MonTrorr, that the phragmocone of the Belemnite belonged
to an animal generically distinct from that which had constructed the spathose
guard. Belemnites whose remains have been left in strata percolated by streams contain-
ing mineral matter in solution, have the chambers of the phragmocone filled with
crystals consequent upon such calcareous or siliceous infiltration: in the present
Belemnites from the Oxford clay, no such infiltration bas taken place subsequent to
interment; we find only the delicate original calcareous framework of the phrag-
mocone, crushed and squeezed out of its original shape, whilst the solid part of the
spathose guard, by virtue of its proper primitive fibrous slructure, has retained its
cylindrical figure. This fact, independently of the microscopie evidence of organiza-

tion, suffices to prove that the weight and solidity of the guard had received no
augmentation by inorganic influences after death*,

That the shell of the Belemnite was due to the formative forces of the mantle of
a molluscous animal, was the sound speculation as to its nature, which our country-
man Josnva PLarT first recorded in the Transactions of the Royal Society for 1764. The presence of a camerated and siphonated structure in this complicated shell, led
Warcn+ and GuerrarD;, and after them most subsequent conchologists, to class
the Belemnites with the Baculites, Orthoceratites, and other more simple chambered
Shells.
