appears to me clear that it is a line of specialisation of a nature similar to that
indicated in the “ filmy” Yodeas, but carried much further, and represented by many
more species in our present Flora, In Todea the “ filmy” habit is accompanied by a
smaller number of spores per sporangium. The fact that some species of
Hymenophyllacee have a larger output per sporangium than any others of the
Gradatz or Mixtee, gives the series a special significance, if as the genus Todea
suggests, the “filmy” habit leads to reduction of the output per sporangium,

The transition from the Gradatze to the Mixtse has probably taken place through
various lines of descent, and, as we may believe it to have been a more modern change,
so we find the steps of the transition quite clearly indicated in living species. That
such a passage from the basipetal to the mixed sorus did take place, seems to
me to be the only explanation of the facts stated at length above for the genera
Dennstedtia, Microlepia, and Davallia, while these lead on naturally to the bulk of
the Pteridez. A reasonable probability of a similar transition has also been made
out for the Cyatheacew, Woodsia, Hypoderris, &e. The biological considerations
brought forward above confirm the probability of this view.

It is possible that a mixed condition of the sorus may have arisen also by inter-
polation of successive sporangia without order in a typical simultaneous sorus, such as
that of Angiopteris or Gileichenia ; but evidence of this has not yet come to hand,

The above paragraphs contain an expression of my own opinion on this matter,
based upon a study of the sori in all the important genera of homosporous Ferns.
But conclusions of this nature ought not to rest upon the study of one part only. It
