aponeurosis of intermandibularis M. dilatator lary ngis with a narrow insertion on the

posterior, hiding intermandibularis anterior part of the arytenoid, overlapped here by the
anterior. constrictor externus, which becomes narrow posteriorly,
and is attached to the tip of the epiphysis of the
postero-medial process, wedged between this and the spoon-shaped lateral process of the
cricoid. M. constrictor laryngis anterior with the usual relationships, but appearing
complicated owing to the fact that some of its fibres cross each other, while others
are continuous from right to left sides. M. constrictor laryngis posterior well developed,
interrupted by the muscular process of the cricoid.
