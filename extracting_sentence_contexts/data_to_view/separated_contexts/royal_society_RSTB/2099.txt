Mayer also found that M. vulgaris is more constant than
M. levis with regard to the position of the dorsal unpaired fins (Maver, p. 273). Hence the evidence taken altogether points to M. vulgaris being a more stable
form than MM. levis. Now the fact that M. levis possesses a yolk-sac placenta
obviously points to its being phylogenetically the younger of the two species. To
quote Mayer, “ Mustelus vulgaris ist der phylogenetisch iiltere, weil es bei ihm noch
nicht zu einer Dottersackplacenta gekommen ist.” Moreover, the greater variability
in M. levis would lead us to suppose that it was the younger form, «.e., that it has
arisen from a form in which the pelvic girdle was more posteriorly situated. Such
considerations seem to add considerable weight to the explanation suggested above
to account for the discrepaney between the caudal portion of the pelvic innervation
in M. levis among the d’s and %’s, and also for the “ posterior collector.” There
remains the assumption that vertebrae have been excalated in front of the pelvis in
M. levis.
