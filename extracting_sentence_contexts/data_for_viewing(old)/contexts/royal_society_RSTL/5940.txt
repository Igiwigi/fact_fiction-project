[he animal should be pinned down (with the back upwards) to a cork-bottomed vessel.
e posterior half of the body may be cut off as unnecessary for our purpose. By
Lone of a curye-scissors a longitudinal incision should then be made along the dorsal
Smedian line. 'The point of the instrument should run in the hollow axis of the intestine.
ELhe integuments should then be pinned down and slightly stretched. A gentle stream
of fresh water 8hould now be allowed to fall on the worm thus opened. 'This will carry
Away the contents of the intestine, and float the delicate parts without arresting ciliary
action. If the operation thus far has been carefully performed, the object is ready for
Soxamination. The eye should be first carefully carried along the septa, or the mem-
—_branous partitions between the annular chambers. It will be seen that these mem-
Sbranous septa, when clearly traced out by the aid of the handle of the scalpel, divide
Svith great regularity the reproductive masses into segmental groups. 'This point impli-
Scates a principle of great anatomical importance. It establishes this fact, viz. that the
contents of each ring or annulus are distinct from, and structurally independent of, those
of the adjacent rings or annulif.

It countenances the idea of the zooidal individuality of each annulus. An annulus
in the generative region is a perfect organism in its nervous, hemal, visceral, fluid and
reproductive parts, not, however, an hermaphrodite organism.

+ Lest the dissector who undertakes to repeat these researches should be led hastily astray, it is here
proper to explain that it is meant only those parts which take their origin in the individual segments, not
