not so clear in the case of human hair till about 30 per cent. extension isreached. Plate 2,
figs. 5a, 5B, and 5c show successive stages in the transformation of Cotswold wool from the
«- to the $-form. It will be noticed that the darkest ares, (020) and (120), are still
present at 35 per cent. extension, though in no photographs are they indubitably present
after 60 per cent. extension, even when the fibres are tilted at an angle to the X-ray
beam equal to the (020) glancing angle. The large group of reflections located about
(001) also fades and finally leaves a smaller spot of spacing approximately that of the
original (001). At the same time the (100) near the centre becomes so weak and obscure
that it is reasonable to assume that it, too, is destroyed by stretching the fibres, though
as a matter of fact in no case was it certain that it had completely disappeared when the
fibres broke. The difficulty of settling this point is aggravated by the cireumstance that

in photographs of stretched hairs the small-angle scattering appears to be much increased
(compare Plate 2, fig. 5c).

Whereas the most prominent layer-line in the «-photograph corresponds to a trans-
lation of 5-15 A.U., the strongest layer-line in the 8-photograph gives a translation of
6-64 A.U., an increase of about 29 per cent. This hyperbola is the one which shows
clearly in Plate 2, fig. 5c. The equatoris marked by three spots, the (001) mentioned above,
