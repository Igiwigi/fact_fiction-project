The removed skins of such atropinised Eels are found to give either a very feeble
ingoing current of rest or outgoing currents which do not reverse with time. This
fact is perhaps best explained upon the hypothesis that atropine diminishes the
activity of the glandular preparatory processes, and is of interest in connection with
the statement by Bayiiss and Braprorp that the E.M.F. of the current of rest of
the skin of the Frog is reduced by treatment with atropine.

When the skin of an atropinised Eel is subjected to stimulation by means of the
break induction shock, it is found that the normal excitatory variation can no longer
be obtained, provided the atropinisation is sufficient.

The following experiment is illustrative of this fact.

Experiment N.

Eel allowed to live in ‘15 per cent. solution of atropine sulphate for 48 hours. —
Pupil slightly dilated but reacted to light. Skin removed immediately after pithing
and led off from outer and inner surfaces. Outer Surface negative to inner. Detlec-
