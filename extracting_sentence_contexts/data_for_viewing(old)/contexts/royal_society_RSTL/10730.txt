thus observe that whether we regard the peculiarity of loading up to a certain point
producing decrease of resistance, and after this point increase, or the comparatively
enormous temporary variations of resistance produced by loading, nickel stands by
itself, and the idea at once suggested itself that this abnormal behaviour of the metal
might be due to the influence of circular magnetization caused by the current employed
in balancing the wire and the comparison-wire. Accordingly two experiments were
made of the following nature :â€”First, as the alteration of resistance might be only
apparent and due to the fact that Viiuarrs shock-currents were not the same in the
stretched and unstretched wires,t both the galvanometer circuit and the battery circuit
were kept closed, and the position of the light on the scale noted with different
stretching weights: the readings taken in this way gave alterations of resistance which
were exactly the same as those obtained by the usnal method. Secondly, as the altera-
tions might be really those of resistance, but due to the fact that circular magnetization,
might cause an alteration of resistance in both iron and nickel, and unequally in
the stretched and unstretched wires, the resistances in the bridge were s0 adjusted that
currents of one-half and one-fourth respectively of the current which had previously

* The numbers 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, on the curves represent the load which had previously been on the
wire before testing for the temporary effect of loading.

+ T did not think this likely, as T had not been able to detect anything of the kind when iron wire
was used.

{ According to AusrBacn, but not according to experiments tried by myself.
