The form of the curve for H,, and in fact of all curves obtained, is not consistent
with the supposition that q is the same for all components. There are two
alternatives to consider in a very simple proof. If the separations are very minute,
all points on the contour not between two componentsâ€”or in other words all points
except very close to the vertex, are outside all the component axes, and if q were
constant throughout, all the boundary beyond a small distance from the vertex
would take the form
