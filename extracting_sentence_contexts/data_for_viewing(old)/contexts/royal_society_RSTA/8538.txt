has the value (l—??—y?)' if this quantity is real, and the value zero if not. Again,
a and p are positive and not individually greater than unity, as in fact is evident.
This formula has also been proved by an independent method.
As suggested already, the equation (A) is one of the landmarks in the solution of
our hydrodynamical problem. If we multiply by 4/(4°-+-7?), where 1 is any real quantity,
and integrate from zero to unity,
