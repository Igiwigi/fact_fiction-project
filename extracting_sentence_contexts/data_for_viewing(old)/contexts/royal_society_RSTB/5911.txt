The General Form of the Brain.

The brain has suffered a certain amount of shrinkage (see fig. 25, Plate 3), which
caused some flattening, but otherwise does not seem to have affected the shape.

The photograph of the ventral surface of the brain, fig. 1, Plate 1, shows the anterior
perforated spaces, the optic tracts and the crura cerebri exposed to an unusual extent.
The row of openings for the basal arteries, lying immediately posterior to the lateral
olfactory tract, is plainly seen; and almost the whole of the orbital surface of the
frontal lobe is exposed to view. The explanation of these facts is seen in the slender
pointed appearance of the temporal poles. The temporal lobes are ill-developed so
that they fail to extend forward and overlap the orbital surface. The orbital surfaces
look narrow and their contour is sharply delimited from the temporal contour by a

definite angle. The narrowness of the temporal lobe, seen both inferiorly and laterally,

and its failure to extend in a forward direction are features which find their almost

exact counterpart in the endocranial cast of Homo rhodesiensis, and in the brains of
