The interesting observation of Dr. WrL1ams,
respecting the termination of minute tracheary ramifications in the vesicles of moths
and butterflies, I have been able in some measure to confirm : I cannot speak posi-
tively as to the trachea actually terminating in the vesicles, but I have seen them
traversing an elongated vesicle from one end to the other, and thus holding nearly
as intimate a relation to the contents as if they had actually terminated in them. * Dr. W1LL1as deecribes, as the constant arrangement of the contents of the tubes, large cells containing
several secondary ones with granular and biliary matter. AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIVER, 115

As reasons for considering the tissue now described as part of the hepatic appa-
ratus, I may mention,â€”Ist, the close resemblance which often exists between the con-
tents of the vesicles and those of the undonbted hiliary tubes ; in several instances, in
fact, they have appeared to me identical. 2nd. The presence of distinctly yellow
fluid, either infiltrating the granular contents of the vesicles, or united to oil-drops :
this fluid may be reasonably supposed to be of the nature of bile.
