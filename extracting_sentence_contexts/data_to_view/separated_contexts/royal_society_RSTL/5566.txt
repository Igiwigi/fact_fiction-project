'The two succeeding bones are less
expanded above and are rather shorter. The last of the series differs from the others
in having its broader extremity directed downwards. It is in fact very similar in form
to the ceratohyal bone, but differs in having the upper extremity and the shaft rather
more cylindrical. The number corresponds with that of the homologous parts of bony
fishes, if we limit the term branchial arch to the gill supporting bones, to the exclusion
of the pharyngeal arch. The proportions of the epibyals in the fossil correspond with
those of the same parts in most of the bony tishes, the firs} being the longest, and the
fourth the shortest, with a broad inferior articulation.
