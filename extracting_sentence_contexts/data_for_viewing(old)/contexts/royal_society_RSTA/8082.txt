The last row in this table shows the shear on the boundary at the mid-section, which
should be zero, and gives an idea of the magnitude of the residual stresses neglected.
Tn the face of this, close agreement with the exact values cannot be expected. In fact,
as fig. 7 shows, the errors increase rapidly after 4 = 0-2, until for 4 = 0-5 the actual

maximum shear is almost three times that given by the approximate solution. Part
of this discrepancy is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only
allows for a fraction of the shear across the diminished section. The whole shear across
the section « = 0 is given by

HP (1 — 0°)? (4 — 492 — 804).
When 2 is small this is very nearly equal to P, but when 2 = 0-5 it reduces to about
0-4 P. We might, then, attempt to adjust the solution in the neighbourhood of the
hole by multiplying by a factor (2-5 in the case of 4 = 0-5) which will restore the total
shear across the mid-section to its true value.* This would bring up the maximum
shear on the section to within a little of its true value, but, besides upsetting the
conditions at a distance, it would also fail entirely to account for the distribution of 66
