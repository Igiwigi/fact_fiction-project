phylogenies [150,151]. This raises the question: at which point in plant evolution does this trait
appear for the first time?

Although Marchantiophyta may be the most probable candidate, a few other groups of extinct
plants could be considered to be the putative ancestor of embryophytes. Although the systematic
nature of these organisms that may have formed a cuticle or a similar extracellular covering is
controversial, they may have played an important role in the transition from water to land. One
of these groups is Nematophytes, puzzling organisms with a tubular organization of uncertain
affinities [152-155].


However, recent investigations have led to the hypothesis that at least some fossil remnants
assigned to Nematophytes are in fact Marchantiophyta [153]. This would fit to the results of the
above-mentioned phylogenies, although other groups of organisms should also be considered in
this context.

There are no superhydrophobic plant surfaces yet known that do not have an underlying
cuticle, thus the cuticle must have evolved prior to the emergence and radiation of land plants in
the Early Silurian. Some fossils assigned to Nematophytes suggest that cuticles may have existed
as early as the Ordovician. The cuticle is one of the key innovations of plants facing the challenges
of living on land, specifically, the risk of desiccation [156]. The cuticle is a multicomponent thin
extracellular membrane [157] covering the primary aerial parts of vascular plants and many, if
not all, bryophytes. It consists of a polymer fraction with embedded soluble components serving
as the interface between plants and their atmospheric environment [84,158,159].
