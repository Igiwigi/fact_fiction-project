have great morphological significance, that such a type of structure is absolutely
restricted to the adoral surface of the later members of this species and the petals
of the Clypeastride. The similar plating of some parts of the petals of Heteraster
oblongus (Plate 69, fig. 2) is hardly comparable, since in that case it is clearly an
adaptation towards the accommodation of more plates in one column of the area
than in the other.
