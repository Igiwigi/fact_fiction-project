appears to have been wholly in the number of the true molars, and not of the pre’
molars, as is particularly well illustrated by the early representatives of the many-
toothed Odontocete Cetacea,* and also by the great majority of the Mesozoic Mam-
malia, many of which,t while still having only four premolars, have from five to eight
true molars. In fact, the earliest forms seem to have normally had a considerable
number of molars, but these were soon reduced down to four in the Metatheria, and
later to three or less in the Eutheria, leaving a few isolated forms, { with larger
numbers as remnants, retaining what the common ancestors of all had once possessed. Two only of the many described genera of these ancient forms have been said to have
more than four premolars, namely, Amphitherium and Amphilestes, each described as
having six premolars and six molars §; but, as even this determination is disputed, |
and in any case rests entirely on the Bet of the teeth, and not on a knowledge. of
their manner of changing, it can hardly be said to prove incorrect the practically
universal rule that the typical number of premolars is, and has always been, at least
since middle Mesozoic times, four, and four only.§

Whether the teeth in the first stage of all were rooted or rootless is very doubtful,
but the probability seems to be on the whole that they were simple conical teeth,
rootless for part, if not the whole, of the animal's life, and possibly not unlike those
now possessed by some of the Dasypodidee.**

This first stage in the Mammalian dental series would probably very fairly repre-
sent, so far as can be judged, the dentition of the Prototheria, the toothed and gene-
ralised ancestors of the living, and now highly specialised, Monotremata, which
there is every presumption for believing, as Professor FLowEr has pointed out,it were
for some time both Homodont and Monophyodont.
