For our present purpose we must use the values of §,, c,., etc., given by equations
such as (1.1) and (1.2). | We shall, therefore, call x, », z the co-ordinates of the
actual position of a point P in the strained solid.

An important point may be noticed here. The fact that two or more solutions
are additive in the ordinary theory ceases to hold good after the introduction of the
square terms in the values of S,, o,., etc.

2—Conditions to be Satisfied by the Displacement

It is obvious that without some restrictions placed on the displacement the
mathematical solution of an elastic problem treated on the hypothesis of a finite
displacement is not going to be unique. This is illustrated by the well-known
example of a piece of rubber tubing turned inside out. We cannot now use the
well-known Consistency equations given by
