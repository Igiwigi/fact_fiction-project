where @, is given by

« = hy Bo/(1—95)! + hyo] (ai /Bi— 95)! (11-35)

Substituting 0 = cos?, it is readily shown that (11-35) expresses the condition and (11-34)
contains the appropriate time-factor for travel by a minimum-time path, partly as a com-
pressional and partly as a distortional wave in the layer. The lengths 4, and /, are neces-
sarily such that a complete path between source and observer is derived and j is the angle

of incidence (as a compressional wave) at the surface or interface. We obtain, in fact, the
equivalent of the ‘T,,’-contribution, and may conclude, therefore, that these so-called
‘T',, disturbances should be felt however close to the source.

Ficure 24, Saddle-point contribution (4; =H+h—z, h,=H).

When h, = 0 the above arguments remain valid, for the steepest-descent curve still
contracts about @ = 1 and the fact that .4(—/) ( real) now increases linearly from # = 1
(not @ = /3, as before) simply cuts out the second possibility of two intersections in
1<6<,/3; the T,,-pulses must therefore always precede the I;,. This case was treated in
part by Lapwood in the problem of the uniform medium, but there were naturally no
A,,- and A,,-branch lines to consider.
