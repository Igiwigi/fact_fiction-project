| There is no doubt that the frequency of the oscillations of the curves depends on the largeness of the
material, that is, on the number of age-combinations according to which it has been divided into
parts. The larger the population observed, or the fewer the number of age-combinations established,
the more regular the course of the curves. This is proved by the fact that the quinquennial recapitula-
tion, based on only 54 age-combinations, shows in both axes a nearly absolutely regular course of its
curves, It may thus be supposed that the 59 curves of the yearly age-combinations would also offer a

regular march if the population observed embraced 14-2 millions of souls. But as I could observe
only half-a-milllion, the frequent oscillations must be accepted as an inevitable consequence of the
quantitative insufficiency of the material.
