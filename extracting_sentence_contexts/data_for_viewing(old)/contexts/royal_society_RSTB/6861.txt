AND CHROMOSOME PAIRING IN OSMUNDA REGALIS 183

A morphological detail, the effect of which should be understood, is the position
of the attachment constriction. This is in no case median but is terminal or subterminal.
The chromosomes therefore appear rod-shaped at a normal metaphase or anaphase
(figs. 26, 46, Plate 17), but at the end of the first meiotic division they appear V-shaped
(cf. fig. 54, Plate 18). This V is not caused by a bend in the middle of each chromosome
but is due to the fact that each is already split in preparation for the next division,
and the split halves diverge from the terminal attachment constriction. Were the
attachment constriction median, the split halves would diverge from both sides of it
to produce an X shape. This relation between the position of the spindle attachment
and the shape of the split chromosomes at anaphase of the first meiotic division is
well known, having been explained first by Gr√©goire (1910) and in greater detail by
Janssens (1924). Further consideration of the lateral movement involved will be
found on p. 190 below.

The gross morphology of the paired chromosomes at diakinesis is shown in fig. 52,
Plate 18. Points to notice are the relatively few chiasmata and the marked absence
of terminalization.
