It was not long before a fierce contest began, which
was destined to continue for many years; a contest which did much good, for it stimulated
research in the field of vision. Asa result, alternative theories began to make an appearance,
coupled with such famous names as Donders (1881), Ladd-Franklin (1893) and McDougall
(1901). But, meanwhile, in 1893, a theory of a very different character made its first appearance,
at the hands of Wundt: ‘ When the retina is stimulated by a coloured light, two essentially
different processes are set into operation; one of these is colourless, while the other is
coloured, being in fact a function of the wave-length of the incident light. Thus, there is
a sensation corresponding to every part of the spectrum. Not three, or even four, primary
colours, but many.’
