Resting spores were frequently found in tow nettings. In autumn and winter after
complete absence of Ditylum from the plankton a few resting spores were usually
found together with vegetative cells and cells like those represented on fig. 13a, 5
(Plate 3), which might be stages of either the formation or germination of resting
spores. Since their appearance coincided with that of vegetative cells of Ditylum after
periods of absence from the plankton they probably were germinating resting spores.
When isolated and placed in culture medium they developed in less than 24 hr. into
normal vegetative cells.

In an attempt to analyse the factors responsible for the formation of resting spores
let us begin with the observations recorded at the beginning of this section and in
Tables Iâ€”III. The outstanding facts are as follows: (1) No resting spores were formed
before the cultures reached the age of 9, 13, and 18 days respectively. During this
period the cells reproduced actively and the Petri dish cultures reached a density of

30,000-50,000 cells in about 35 c.c. of fluid, i.e. about 1000 cells per c.c. of culture
medium. (2) There followed a period of 9-15 days with formation and subsequent
germination of a great number of resting spores. The reproduction of the cells not

undergoing spore formation continued and the culture became very dense. (3) Finally
the resting spores developed a stronger silicious membrane and persisted. The cultures
