Sotms LAusacu, to have been arranged in three concentric verticils on each whorl of
bracts; in the present uncertain state of the facts for this species, it is useless to
surmise how this condition may have come about, but it is to be remembered that
antero-posterior fission and interpolation, which are both seen in the Angiospermic
flower, might either of them result in the condition observed.

Taking all the facts together, and reading them in the light of those relating to
the Lycopods and Psilotacese, with which the Sphenophyllese have undeniable
relations, the following seems a reasonable view of their spore-producing members :
that the fundamental type is that of the Lycopods and Psilotacem, viz., that each
spore-producing organ was subtended by a sporophyll. This type appears to hold for
S. trichomatosum ; also, though perhaps without constancy, in S. majus, which shows
besides in its “ Selago” condition, and ill-defined strobilus, what may be regarded as
a more primitive state than that in the strobiloid species; the sporangiophore in this
