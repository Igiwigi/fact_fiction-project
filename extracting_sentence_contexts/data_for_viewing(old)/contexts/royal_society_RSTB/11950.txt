Prematurity (delivery at a gestational age of less than 37 weeks) [1] affects 11%
of live births worldwide. The sequelae of preterm birth constitute a significant
public health problem, with preterm birth complications responsible for 35% of
neonatal deaths (in the first 28 days of life) worldwide [2], and contributing to
50% of all deaths in this age group. In addition to death in the neonatal period,
preterm birth is associated with a range of longer-term physical and neuro-
developmental consequences such as moderate/severe cognitive impairment,
motor impairment and cerebral palsy [2]. It leads to an estimated annual 106
million disability-adjusted life years [3], and thus places a significant burden
on parents, carers and health systems [4]. Why preterm birth should be so
common (up to 18% of all live births in countries such as Malawi [5]), despite
the fact that the consequences can be so catastrophic, remains unclear.

In this review, we will outline the hypotheses that have been advanced that
place the phenomenon of human preterm birth in an evolutionary context.
After discussing these, we will focus specifically on addressing the hypothesis
that preterm birth may, in some circumstances, be a predictive, adaptive,
response to adverse in utero conditions for the fetus. In order to do so, we
