The massive data size is due to several factors. First of all,
simulations require cellular decompositions, instead of more compact boundary
representations. This fact alone accounts for one order of magnitude increase in
model size. Also, the common factoring of repeated substructures, exploited to a
great extent by large-scale hierarchical models in computer graphics, cannot be
benefited from when dealing with large deformations, thus producing an increase of
several orders of magnitude in the model size. Finally, consider the sheer number
and complexity of components: there are thousands of atoms in a protein, several
thousand proteins in a cell, and so on.
