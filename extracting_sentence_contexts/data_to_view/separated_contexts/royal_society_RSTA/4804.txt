Sropart,* who, in the course of an investigation on the alloys of iron with other
metals, noted their failure to produce certain alloys by “ cementation,” but consider
it “remarkable,” in the case of platinum, that it will unite with steel at a tempe-
rature at which the steel itself is not affected. They also show that solid steel
and platinum, in the form of bundles of wires, may be welded together “with the
same facility as could be done with iron or steel,” and they observe that on etching
the surface of the welded mass by an acid “ the iron appeared to be alloyed with the
platinum.” Their interest in this singular fact led them to promise some direct
~ &xperiments on “this apparent alloy by cementation,” that is, by the interpene-
S tration of solids. Since this time there have been many more or less isolated
p ‘ observations bearing on the subject, and brief reference may be made to the more
‘g important of them in chronological order. In 1877 Cuernorrt showed that if
two surfaces of iron of the same nature be placed in intimate contact, and heated
a to about 650° they will unite.
