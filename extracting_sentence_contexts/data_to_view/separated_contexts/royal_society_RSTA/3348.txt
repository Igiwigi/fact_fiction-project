Our prejudice is that this is the case: life is one of the processes that
allows planets to come to equilibrium. If life is, in fact, a means to dissipate free energy, one would expect that the mechanisms
behind all its universal properties involve free energy-driven non-equilibrium processes. One
of these universal features of life is homochiralityâ€”the fact that all the chiral amino acids used
by terrestrial biology are left handed (the sugars are right handed). The fact that this effect is
not a mere enantiomeric excess is surprising and requires a detailed explanation. Our recent
work [5] shows that homochirality emerges as a consequence of a rather general characteristic
of life: autocatalysis/self-replication driven by an external source of energy.
