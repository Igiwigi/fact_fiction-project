But so far as I am aware
they represent the only material so far published on which a definite judgment can be
founded—where by definite judgment, I mean one based on quantitative facts, and
not drawn from a general estimate of nature which makes no statement whatever
of the intensity of either variability or heredity for any single character in any one
species of living things. The data I have given seem entirely opposed to Mr. Sepe¢wick’s view, but I very
fully realise that they are far from exhaustive. They indicate, however, what
I hold to be the only valid method of approaching any problem in variation or
heredity, 7.¢., laborious statistical collection of actual facts. My statistics may be
insufficient, I would heartily welcome additions to them; or they may be dealt with
fallaciously. Here is the material; let others add to and, if need be, modify the
conclusions.
