The
mere fact that, the worse the hygienic conditions, the more do children who are
weakly die off in childhood, does not altogether account for the differences in the
death-rate from phthisis. For, in spite of this survival of the fittest, the general
death-rate above 20 increases steadily from the better to the worse houses
(including Infirmary and Poor-houses), although the increase is nothing like so great
as it is for children, Were phthisis due merely to the influence of bad hygienic
conditions, we should, therefore, still expect the death-rate to increase up to the two-
and one-roomed houses. As a matter of fact, although those under good hygienic
conditions suffer by far the least from phthisis, yet it tells most heavily on those
under only moderately bad hygienic conditions, and this is the case even when all the
deaths in the Infirmary and Poor-houses are set down against those under the worst
hygienic conditions, 7.e., those in the one- and two-roomed houses. This would seem
to indicate a predisposition to tubercular disease in a certain proportion of the
individuals, quite apart from general constitutional weakness. Under good hygienic
conditions the great majority of these will escape altogether.
