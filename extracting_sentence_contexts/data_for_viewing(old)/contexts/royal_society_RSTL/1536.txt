and Experiments on Vision. 385

IV. Being now in possession of a new instrument, I next
attempted to gain, by means of it, some illustration of the
changes, which the vision of short-sighted persons undergoes
from age.

It has been very generally, if not universally, asserted by
systematic writers upon vision, that the short-sighted are ren-
dered by age fitter for seeing distant objects than they were
in their youth. But this opinion appears to me unfounded in
fact, and to rest altogether upon a false analogy. If those
who possess ordinary vision, when young, become, from the
flatness of the cornea, or other changes in the mere structure
of the eye, long-sighted as they approach to old age, it fol-
lows, that the short-sighted must, from similar changes, be-
come better fitted to see distant objects. Such appears to have
been their reasoning. But the course pursued by nature seems
very different from that which they have assigned to her.
For of four short-sighted persons of my acquaintance, the
ages of whom are between fifty-four and sixty years, and into
the state of whose vision I have inquired particularly, rwo
have not observed that their vision has changed since they
were young, and two have lately become, in respect to dis-
