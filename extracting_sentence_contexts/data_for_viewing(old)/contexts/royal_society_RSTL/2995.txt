The Aurora Boreales, though viſible- almoſt®
every night of clear weather, in the. more northern-- ; C1
regions, .and very high in the atmoſphere, .can - off
ſcarce be viſible in England, but when the atmo- 1
ſphere is pretty clear of clouds, for the whole ſpace-- |
between us and thoſe regions, and therefore are-. 1
ſeldom! viſible here. . This extenſive clearneſs may 8!
have been. produced by a long continuance of [
northerly winds. When»the- winds - have long b
continued in one quarter, 'the return is often vio- i

lent. Allowing the fact fo repeatedly obſerved by 7
Mr. ' Winn, perhaps this may account for the - ©
violence of the ſoutherly winds, that ſoon follow..
the appearance of the .Aurora.on our. coaſts. .
