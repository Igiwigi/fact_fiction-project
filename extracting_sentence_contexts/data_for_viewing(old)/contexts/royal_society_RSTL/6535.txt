merely heating the medium, or by some luminiferons action analogous to its heating,
nothing is really established. Heat is known to produce 80me brilliant lines when metallic
vapours are introduced into flames; and it is possible that a temperature far above that
of our hottest flame might bring out all those which I have enumerated, and the multi-
tude of others which I did not attempt to measure. But is the temperature of the elec-

trie discharge 80 immensely superior to all others? and are there no means of estimating
its real amount? Two of the facts which I have noted respecting these discharges may
at least direct attention to this snbject. In general the spectra of the simple spark of
an induction machine are much fainter than when a jar, however 8mall, is connected
with it; and those with a small jar than those with a large. Thus, with silver elec-
trodes in air, the spark gave twenty-three lines, of which 3 and 09 were © very bright;” a
jar of 0-5 foot coating gave also twenty-three, but differently placed, more at the red,
fewer at the violet, but seven of them #8; the normal one of 1:25 foot gave thirty-one,
with nine #s; and two large of 8-5 feet gave thirty-six, with ten #s and many others
A © very bright.” In these cases, were one to judge from first appearances, the spark heats
< air much more than the jar-discharge, for it has much greater power to burn anything
S which it encounters; but its section is larger, because much of it is conducted by the
- air which surrounds it ; and besides, from the diminished resistance, the amount of heat
£ produced may be less, as well as less concentrated. We cannot ay it must be; we know
