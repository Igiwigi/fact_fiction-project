We $hall endeavour to trace the course of the cotidal lines according to
which the tide is actually propagated in the Ocean ; and it will be seen that
they exemplify most of the preceding remarks. But before we proceed to do
this, it will be proper to make a ſew remarks respecting the tide observations
which we possess, and which must be our materials for such an attempt.

Sect. IT. On the causes of inaccuracy in Tide Observations.

1. Difference between the time of High Water and the time of Slack Water.—
When we begin to compare the times of the tide at different places as stated
by the best authorities, in the usual manner, we find a great number of cases
which seem to interfere altogether with any notion of obvious connexion and
simple laws prevailing in this class of facts. Thus, if we refer to these autho-
rities as recorded on Mr. LunBock's chart, published in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1831, we find many instances where places very near each
other are marked with yery different hours. 'The hour at the Eddystone is

marked VIII, while on the adjacent coast of Deyonshire it is V ; on the coast
at the Land's End it is IV4, but at a very little distance it is V4. On the
north coast of Ireland IVZ and IX4 stand close to each other ; and similar dis-
crepancies appear in many other places. Such discrepancies seem at, first to
make it impossible that the cotidal waves should have any regularity in their
