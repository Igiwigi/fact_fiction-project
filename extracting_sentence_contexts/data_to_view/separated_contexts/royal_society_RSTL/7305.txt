The secondary caustic may be considered as the envelope of the tangent, and the
equation be obtained in this manner. Comparing with the general equation

A cos 26+D in 29+C cos 6+D in 9+E=0,

we have
A=2z,
B==—y,
C==—2,
D=05
EB=m,

and thence
S=4{3(a* +1) +m*—3},
T=4{18m(a*+p?) —27z—2n*+ 9m},

8'—T*=16V,

giving
if for a moment,
V=4{3(a*+#)+m*—3}*
—{18m(a4+})—2T&—=2n*+9m}?. The equation of the curve is thus obtained in the form V=0

E ; this should of course
be equiyalent to the before-mentioned equation U=

0; and by developing V, and com-

paring with the second of the two expressions of U, it appears that we in fact have
V=2TU.

9. Taking as parameter tan 4 6, or if we please cos 9+4x/ —1 sin 6, the foregoing values
of (x,y) in terms of 6 give (x,y, 1) proportional to rational and integral functions of the
parameter of the degree 6; 80 that not only the curve is a sextic curve, but it is a uni-
cursal sextic, or curve of the order 6 with the maximum number, =10, of nodes and
cusps; that is, if $ be the number of nodes and # the number of cusps, we have 3+x=10. Moreover, introducing the same parameter into the equation of the tangent, this equation
is 8een to be of the degree 4 in the parameter ; that is, the class of the curve is =4: this
implies 23+3z=26, and we have therefore 3=4, z=6.
