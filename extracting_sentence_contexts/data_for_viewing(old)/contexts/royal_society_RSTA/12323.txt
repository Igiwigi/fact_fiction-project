[Nore.—The above is the whole passage given by Dr. Lister about Trade Winds.
The rest of his paper relates to entirely different subjects, chiefly to salt springs and
brines. ]

one on each side, in each of which the wind prevails from east to west, with an
accompanying motion in each case towards the Equator.

We may, indeed, suppose, that such knowledge was only gradually acquired, chiefly
