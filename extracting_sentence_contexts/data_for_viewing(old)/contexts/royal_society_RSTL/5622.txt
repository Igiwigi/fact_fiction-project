In a former memoirÂ® I endeavoured to give a general view of the rational constitution
of all the organo-metallic bodies then known, by showing that they all possessed a mole-
cular isonomy with the inorganic compounds of the respective metals. The only com-

pound which at that time did not coincide with this view was Lov16's 80-called ethosti-
bylic acid, the formula of which, Sb C,H,O,, I snggested would probably be found to be
erroneous #; and in fact, L6v1G has since announced this to be the case: he now assigns
to this compound the formula Sb(C,H,),O,, 2SbO,, which harmonizes perfectly with the
general view I ventured to propound. The recent researches of MgrcKF upon the com-
pounds of stibethyl, although they probably prove the existence of certain new com-
pounds of this radical, are by no means conclusive as to the non-existence of the bodies
originally described by L6vi6. With regard to those stanethyl compounds which have
been since discovyered, several of them correspond exactly with the known oxides of tin ;
the remainder are also by no means irreconcileable with my hypothesis, if we consider
the polymeric attributes of stannic acid. Nevertheless, I conceive that the formulee, and
even the existence of some of the more complex stanethyl compounds, require confirma-
tion before these bodies can be employed, either for the support or disproof of any
general theory of the rational constitution of organo-metallic compounds.
