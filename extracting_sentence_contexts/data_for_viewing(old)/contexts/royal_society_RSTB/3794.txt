INTRODUCTION.

It is rather a curious fact that it has been left to agricultural chemists to bring
into prominence the important part that free-living Protozoa may play in the soil.
At the present time it seems to us that the prevalent idea as regards the distribution
of free-living protozoa is that they can exist in the trophic state only in definite
accumulations of fresh water (e.g., pools, rivefs, lakes) or in the sea. It seems also to
be generally held that after the drying up of small pools the cysts of protozoa are
transported by currents of air, and that it is to these wind-borne cysts that the
prevalence of protozoa in cultures of ordinary soils may be mostly attributed. It is
very difficult to trace the historical origin of this view, but it is evident that to the
early workers on protozoa the idea of this limitation of their active life to water was
unthought of.

It is unnecessary to refer here to the works of very early writers, by whom the
