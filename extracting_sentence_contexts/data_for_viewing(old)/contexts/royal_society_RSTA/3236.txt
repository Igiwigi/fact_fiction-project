V(@) in equation (2.1). Hence, we need to replace V(#) with the effective potential that is sensitive a
to the quantum effects, which we denote with Vog(#), in (2.1). The important point here is that the DB
infra-red modes are correctly taken into account by the Fokker-Planck equation (2.1) so Veg(¢) : oe
should include only the ultraviolet physics. Furthermore, since we are interested in physics 78
during inflation with a large scale H >> Aj, the curvature of the background must be included Dw
in the computation of Veg(¢). :

3. Effective potential in curved space 3

The calculation for the quantum corrected effective potential at the ultraviolet limit is surprisingly
simple when compared with what one usually encounters when deriving an effective potential
on a curved background. The reason for this is that at the ultraviolet limit all well-behaved field
theories must have universal behaviour, which translates as the fact that the divergences that are
generated are independent of the state in which they are calculated. Hence, at very high momenta
even with a background with large curvature the effective potential resembles very much the
well-known flat space results. Another way of understanding the simplification arising at short
wavelength modes is realizing that any smooth surface when magnified enough will approach
flat space.

The effective potential in the high ultraviolet on an arbitrary curved background we can
very conveniently derive via the resummed heat kernel method [13]. This includes the essential
curvature terms. We point out that this derivation is completely semi-classical or that gravity is
not quantized. Since A;/Mp1 <1 this is an accurate approximation when the Higgs is not the
dominant energy component, as was recently rigorously shown to be true in [6].
