This
category, which is a form of social amplification of risk, recognizes that the response to climate
trends and events can often have greater consequences than the first-order climate impact itself. These transmission mechanisms typically occur across geographical scales and borders and are
embedded in competition for resources and economic and political institutions. We refer to this
as resource-generated transmission (usually amplification), in recognition of the fact that it is
the scarcity of resource, or at least perception of its scarcity, that is the principal reason for the
propagation of risk. This transmission mechanism is, therefore, characterized by amplification of
risks through the social systems where those risks are ultimately manifest. Resource-generated
amplification may occur because of prior systemic risk (e.g. where food systems are failing to
deliver food security), or they may be dominated by the aggregate response to the climate risk, or
even action anticipating real or perceived risk.
