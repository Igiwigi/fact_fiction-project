Calamites sp. (External surface of the stem.)

Mr.. Rogers has in his collection (No. 54) a small fragment of a Calamite obtained
from Broadstone quarry, Bideford, which exhibits the external surface of the bark
and some branch sears at the node. The specimen is too fragmentary to determine
specifically, It is, however, interesting from the fact that such specimens are of rare
occurrence in the British Coal Measures,
