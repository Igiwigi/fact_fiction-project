Indian Oceans have been trained in pre-event assessment of hazards through different UNESCO (3

Comparatively less attention was paid to the safety of nuclear power plants (NPPs) post-2004, : s

the Boxing Day tsunami survived fairly unscathed. India has three coastal NPPs, at Kalpakkam,
Kudankulam and Tarapur [3]. The tsunami hit the Madras Atomic Power Station at Kalpakkam,
whose Unit 2 was operational. The seawater level, normally 3m below the operating floor of the
pump house, rose to approximately 1.9m above it, flooding the pumping assembly. The reactor
was brought to safe shutdown successfully. Yet, there had been no warning for the imminent
tsunami [4].

Since the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 in the United States which ‘encouraged private
corporations to build nuclear reactors’ [5], the construction of NPPs has faced controversy by
alliances of mainstream environmental and mainstream anti-nuclear weapon groups. The nuclear
industry worldwide has thus had an increased sensitivity to criticism, and their assessments have
