are supposed to appertain to the mammary system : and it is obyious that our
knowledge of the true affinities of the Monotremata greatly depends on a
complete elucidation of this subject. To it, therefore, my attention has been
particularly directed wheneyer an opportunity has occurred of examining the
Ornithorhymchus paradozus ; and I have invariably noted the condition of

the uterine organs with reference to that of the glands in question. In this
way a series of facts has been ascertained, which I have yentured, from the
interest of the 8ubject to which they relate, to submit to this learned Society.
But as the value of these observations, in a great measure, arises out of the
state of doubt in which the question was left by previous researches, I have
premised a short abstract of the anatomical history of the Monotremata.

Echidna Hystriz and Ornithorhynchus paradozus were first described and
figured by Dr. Saaw ; the former, as early as the year 1792, in the third yolume
of the © Naturalist's Miscellany,” under the denomination of Myrmecophaga
aculeata ; the latter, in the tenth yolume of the same work, in 1799, by the
name of Platypus anatinus. In the following year this extraordinary animal
received a further description, together with its present generally adopted ap-
pellation, from Professor BLUMENBACH ; and about the same time, Sir Evgranp
