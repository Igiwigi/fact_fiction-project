It would be superfluous to repeat, in summary, the facts relating to the mode of
decline of the excised Mammalian heart which are described in the second, third, and
fourth paragraphs of our paper. The extraordinary sluggishness of action, of which
these showed us that the Mammalian heart is capable under the conditions of our
experiments, tempted us to analyse as far as possible the mode and mechanism of
cardiac contraction in Mammalia,

In this direction the chief result, which we regard as established, is that on the
Mammalian heart, under conditions similar to those in which the Frog’s heart has been
examined in this respect, the passage of an excitatory wave is demonstrable as a
diphasic variation with the galvanometer and the electrometer, and that the passage
of a corresponding wave of contraction is demonstrable by mechanical methods. As regards the Mammalian heart, neither of these facts have, so far as is known to
us, been hitherto observed ; as regards the Frog’s heart, we have incidentally added to
the classical phenomenon of the diphasic variation a demonstration of its mechanical
aspect as a wave of muscular contraction. The similarity between the excised
Mammalian heart and the excised Batrachian heart is thus far complete. But there
are points of divergence.
