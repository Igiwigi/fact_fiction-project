The discoveries made by exoplanets are constantly
challenging that ground truth: demographics, formation, composition, etc. Yet, things can only


challenge a view on ground truth when there is one to challenge. In the case of the Ice Giants—
Uranus and Neptune—we do not in fact know the ‘knowns’. The exploration of our solar system has been going on for millennia since the first person
looked up and wondered why and how the sun, moon and stars moved. However, it was not
until the invention of the telescope, rockets, and an ability to remotely power objects, that allowed
us to truly examine our nearest neighbours.
