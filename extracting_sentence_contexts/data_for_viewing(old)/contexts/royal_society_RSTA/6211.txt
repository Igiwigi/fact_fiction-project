possible with new forms of the antisymmetric H-field [65], and a variety of inhomogeneous
solutions with an initial Kasner era [66]. For more results of this type, see the comprehensive

(h) F(R)-cosmology

A rather different modification of the basic dynamical form of general relativity than the Brans— :2
Dicke or more generally the scalar-tensor theories—higher-order gravity—appeared very early : S
and continues in new forms until today, having major ties with early universe cosmology. Based : Ss
on earlier impressive and original work of Lanczos (cf. [68,69] and references therein) and others : =
on the influence of higher-order invariants of the Riemann tensor on the structure of general :g
relativity, a particular choice eventually seemed simple and general enough: the gravitational [3
Lagrangian be an arbitrary analytic function of the scalar curvature, f(R). In fact, this leads under : S
a metric variation to fourth-order field equations, not second order-like general relativity (while : Ss
other types of variation may lead to second-order ones, see below). The result is a new theory of : =I

gravitation, f(R)-gravity.

Keeping f(R) analytic means that this type of theory will be expected to play a significant role in
the extreme conditions of the early universe where higher-powers of the scalar curvature become
important, but not for late-time evolution (where such powers become negligible). f(R)-gravity
is hence expected to convey some of the importance of the influence of quantum gravitational
effects in the early universe even though everything is classical.

Some first impressions of f(R)-gravity to cosmology were given in the period considered (e.g.
