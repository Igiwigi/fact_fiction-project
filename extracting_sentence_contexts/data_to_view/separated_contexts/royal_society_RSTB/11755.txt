is the one proposed by Mazur (1987) [59]: that of the certain payoff because in a subjective sense 200 is less

than twice 100. This explains why she might choose to avoid
the risky option and chose the safe outcome instead of the
lottery despite the fact that to an actuary they are equivalent. Conversely, a risk seeking individual will have a convex utility
function, with increasing marginal utility, and therefore will
accept many gambles instead of the certain outcome. A risk-
