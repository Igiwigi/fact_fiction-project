The occurrence of macrospores and their germination among the sterile tissue of
the cone-axis is not the least puzzling of the many remarkable features presented by
the life-history of Welwitschia. The morphological nature of the ovule in general
is still in doubt and the evidence bearing upon the question inadequate and
conflicting.* The view, formerly prevalent, that it belongs to the category of the
caulome, is in fact a bud, has fallen into disrepute, and authorities are now for
the most part divided in supporting two alternate hypotheses, the one that the
ovule with its integuments is a structure swi generis, and the other that, whatever
its position, it is part of the sporophyll, .e. foliolar. For Welwitschia there is no
escape from the conclusion that it is a bud.
