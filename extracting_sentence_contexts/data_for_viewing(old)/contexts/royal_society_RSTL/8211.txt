The tibialis anticus had a femoral origin, which was very slender, as well as its usual
head from the lower two thirds of the tibia; from the same femoral tendon arose the
extensor digitorum, and, indeed, the tendon seemed to belong to this muscle more properly

than to the last. There were two peronzi, longus and brevis, a two-headed gastrocnemius,
a flexor hallucis double the size of the flexor digitorum, and a very small tibialis posticus.
The tendons of the flexor hallucis and digitorum appeared to blend inseparably.

As I wish to make this paper a simple record of anatomical facts, I forbear to make
any comments on the dissections given above; but they will doubtlessly suggest many
interesting lines of thought. The comparison between Bird and Bat myology, between
the muscles of the Bats and those of other flying mammals, and the relations of the
anatomical structure of the Bat's fore limb with its method of flight, are all fertile

8ubjects for study, while the importance of the bearing of the displaced hind-limb

muscles in the Bat on serial homology cannot be overrated.
