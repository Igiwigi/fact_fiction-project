on the Functions of the Brain, 471 Although insensibility is the common effect of undue pres-
Sure.upon the cerebrum, it appears from what will be stated,
that it is not a necessary consequence of undue pressure upon
the cerebellum. The facts which have been stated appear to point out the
use of the water in the ventricles of the brain, and they ac-
count for the great variety which is met with in the form
and extent of the posterior cornua of the lateral ventricles,
their size varying according to the quantity of water which
is necess8ary to keep up the pressure required. The size of the ventricles would appear to be very imma-
terial, since even when they are increased 80 as to contain
above six ale pints, the functions of the brain are all carried
on, and the growth of the body proceeds ; but after the skull
is completely ossified, an increase of two or three ounces pro-
duces insensibility. That the ventricles should admit of being increased to s0
great an extent, without any of the senses or faculties of the
brain being destroyed, is in itself a curious fact, and of s0
much importance with respect to the physiology of the brain,
that I shall detail the two following cases, which illustrate one
another,
