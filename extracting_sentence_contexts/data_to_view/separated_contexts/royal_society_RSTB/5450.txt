(a) Mid-gut.—l have already pointed out (EAsrHAM, 1927) that anteriorly and
posteriorly in the regions of future mouth and anus, cell masses are proliferated
inwards from the germ band towards the yolk in front of and behind the main
mesoderm mass respectively. The formation of these cell masses differs from that of
the mesoderm, an early indication of the different fates destined for these masses. That cell mass which is formed in the oral region, which I have already called the anterior
endoderm rudiment, arises at the beginning of the gastrulation process and the corre-
sponding posterior endoderm rudiment arises later—in fact its development coincides
with the completion of gastrulation. It follows that at the end of gastrulation we shall
find the anterior endoderm rudiment much bigger than the posterior rudiment. The
stomodzeum and proctodeeum now develop as invaginations in the ectoderm, covering
the endoderm rudiments.
