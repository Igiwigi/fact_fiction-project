= To denote the nerye-regions that are subjected to the two kinds of influence, we

EZ consisting of a polar region immediately beneath the electrode, in which the electrical

© * Our experiments with this method were few, and for the reasons given in the text we do not lay any
8tress upon the results obtained. These were as follows :—

With the galvanic kathode above or below the negative polarising electrode the make contraction
(K.0.C.) was diminished. On breaking the current a contraction appeared (K O.O.?).

With the galvanic anode above or below the negative polarising electrode the break contraction
(A.0.0.) was diminished; the make contraction (A.O.C.) variable.

On testing with the make and break induction currents the effect of the kathode of either was
diminished in the neighbourhood of the polarising kathode, increased in that of the polarising anode; the
