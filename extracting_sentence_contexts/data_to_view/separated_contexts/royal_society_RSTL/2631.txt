A rigorous examination of this question would probably
elucidate many phenomena of electrical action at present involved in doubt : in the
mean time it may not be unimportant to review such facts connected with this point
as are already known.

45, It has been found, for example, that the attractive force between charged and
insulated neutral bodies is less than when the latter are uninsulated ; that perfect in-
sulators are not sensibly attracted by electrified substances ; and that, in every case of
electrical attraction, the force is (as already obseryed,) proportionate to the previous
induction of which the bodies are susceptible. In accordance with these facts a per-
fectly insulating disc reposes on a charged surface without becoming itself electrified ;
an insulated neutral conducting disc more or less $0, in proportion to its thickness
(42.); whilst an insulated plate whose inductive power is nearly perfect, is charged to
equality with the point touched (36.). ;

I have found in the course of some recent inquiries that the attractive force
between an electrified plane surface and an insulated disc of inconsiderable thick-
ness, in a neutral state, is frequently in an inverse ratio of the distance between the
two planes ; the induction of which such a disc is susceptible being extremely limited ;
that on increasing the thickness the force also increases up to a certain point, where,
under the given conditions of distance, quantity of electricity, and the like, the induc-
tion on the opposed surface remains nearly the same.

46. These facts, together with those already mentioned in the course of these inquiries,
render it highly probable that the quantity of electricity taken up from the surface of
a charged body by a small insulated disc of inconsiderable thickness may be greatly
influenced by the position of the point of application, independently of the quantity of

electricity ; 0 that the same quantity may possibly exist in two different points, and |
yet the proof plane hecome charged in a different ratio, the inductive power of the
plate being different in these/points.” M. Bior, in the second volume: of his Traits de
Physique®, has given, from CouLomst's mannscripts, an account of the application of
the proof plane to'an electrified lamina of steel plate, eleven inches in length, one inch
in width, and half a line thick. He states, that when the proof plane, which was an
inch long and about a quarter of an inch wide, was applied beyond the extremity of
the charged lamina, s0 as to touch its two opposite surfaces, the plate abstracted the
electricity of both, and exhibited a reaction double of that which it showed when only
applied at the extremity of one of the surfaces.
