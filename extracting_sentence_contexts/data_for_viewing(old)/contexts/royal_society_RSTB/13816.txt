temperature and metabolic conditions [48,49], particular
foraging and orientation strategies involving the production
of echolocation signals (e.g. in bats and dolphins) [50], anatom-
ical adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle (such as phonic lips in
Odontocetes) [51], as well as environmental noise (whether
biotic [52] or abiotic [53]). Note, in particular, that most vocal
learning mammals are not typical terrestrial quadrupeds,
but rather aquatic (cetaceans), semi-aquatic (pinnipeds) or
terrestrial flying animals (bats). Therefore, our and any cross-
species analysis needs to consider these speciesâ€™ adaptation
to a highly three-dimensional lifestyle: this factor, rather than
VPL, could be the main driver of allometric deviations. Like-
wise, the fact that several vocal learners also echolocate
introduces an additional bias. Unfortunately, until more
species of terrestrial vocal learners are discovered, it will be
difficult to disentangle these factors. Second, selective press-
ures may also have favoured the emergence of vocal learning
abilities without necessarily affecting acoustic allometry
relationships. For instance, Fischer et al. [11] recently demon-
strated that vocal convergence in Guinea baboons was
dependent on the amount of social interactions between indi-
viduals, therefore showing that some implicit forms of vocal
learning can likely originate from social factors, and that allo-
metry scaling need not be affected for a species to exhibit
vocal learning abilities. In addition to confirming other vocal
