However, on a quantum level we face a new and fundamental challenge:
quantum noise of the laser light. One could argue that quantum noise must be an inordinately small effect. However, the fact
today is that the advanced gravitational wave detectors (such as aLIGO, adVIRGO and GEO-HF)

Figure 2. Projected noise budget of aLIGO (black curve) with relevant contributing noise sources (from The LIGO Scientific 7B
Collaboration [5]). As the noise sources are uncorrelated, they collectively add as the square root of the sum of the squares [Ss
of the individual terms, making the largest noise sources the most dominant.
