Conclusion, lessons learnt and outlook

A first prototype for a new type of telescope for muography applications, based on mini-gRPC
detectors, has been developed following the requirements of small cost and portability, where
the latter is intended to be not only in terms of dimension and weight but also by ensuring gas
tightness and ease of transportation of the full set-up, including electronics. This first experience has been encouraging, as we were able to design, build from scratch,

and operate our muon telescope in a very short time, verifying the robustness and portability : =
of the set-up and achieving reasonable performances. In the process, we learned several lessons. : =
We need to invest in a reliable gas mixing system, and we need to measure the efficiency of our 3
detectors as a function of time over long time scales; in fact, the quality of the gas can degrade : =
over time, even in the absence of significant leakages, due to the out-gassing of the detector : R
components (S. Procureur 2018, private communication). : S
After addressing the aforementioned issues, we plan to build a new prototype to move further : s
from proof of principle towards real applications. The following developments are considered. : S
The intrinsic spatial resolution of RPCs can easily be better than O(1 mm); therefore, thinner : 3

strips would allow us to perform high-resolution muography.
