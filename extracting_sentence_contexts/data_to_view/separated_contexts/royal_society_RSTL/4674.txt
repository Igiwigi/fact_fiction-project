If it should be possible to confer on the
former that tendency to assume regular forms with which the latter are endowed,
the separation of the proximate colouring or colour-giving (colorable) matters of
madder will be easy, and it will thus be possible to establish their elementary com-
position and thence their relation to one another,”

To Mr. J. Hiccin is due the merit of having first called attention to the fact, that
important changes take place during the process of dyeing with madder, which can
only be explained by supposing that an actual formation of colouring matter takes
place during the process. In his paper © On the Colouring Matters of Madderf,
Mr. Hiccin has detailed his experiments on that peculiar substance discovered in
madder by KUnLiMaxN and called by him Xanthine.
