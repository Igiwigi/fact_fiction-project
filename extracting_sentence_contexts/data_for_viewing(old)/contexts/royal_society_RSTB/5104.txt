of tissue (fig. 1, dt.) that emerges from a slight hollow in the face of the gland, and is
attached at the other end to the deep surface of the pharyngeal mucous membrane.

A careful examination of the free surface of the mucous membrane opposite this spot,
in the region of the claviculo-pterygial joint shows, though often with considerable

difficulty, a small slit-like pore (fig. 1, p.). Through this a bristle can be passed up the
connecting strand of tissue into the thymus. The strand of tissue is, in fact, a duct-
like tube, opening at one end into the branchial cavity and at the other entering the
substance of the thymus, and to the naked eye presenting all the characters of the duct
of an ordinary ducted gland.

Sections through this “ duct ” and the parts of the thymus adjacent to it show, how-
ever, that the relation of the two is not, strictly speaking, that of a duct to its gland,
but that the tube is rather an out-pushing of the wall of the branchial chamber inti-
mately associated at its distal end with the reticulum and reticular spaces of the
thymus, but not connected, as the duct of a gland would be, with definite secreting
alveoli or tubules.

The tube (Plate 1, fig. 1) is lined by a mucous membrane exactly similar to that of
