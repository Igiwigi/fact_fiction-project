The mutual actions of the 8011, air, organic matter in the soil or in the plant, are
not such as to be likely to affect the result of the experiment, by yielding to the plants
a quantity of combined Nitrogen not taken into account. The influence of Ozone as a
possible element in these actions would be less, in the circumstances of the experiments

milation, than in those of experiments the results of which showed no appreciable
tion of compounds of Nitrogen (Section II. Sub-sections A—C, PP- 484-497).
\ The fact of the evolution of free Nitrogen during the decomposition of nitro-
mus organic matter has been confirmed by experiment ; but the circumstances of the
position in which the evolution of free Nitrogen was observed, when compared
those involved in an experiment on the question of assimilation, are not s8wch
to lead to the conclusion that there would be a loss of Nitrogen from this source in
xperiments of the latter kind, unless in certain exceptional cases, in which it might be
pposed (Section II. Sub-sectign D, pp. 497 -508).
6. The forces, by virtue of which free Nitrogen is eliminated from its compounds in
,anic matter, are of an oxidizing character; they are not exercised in the absence of
ygen.
