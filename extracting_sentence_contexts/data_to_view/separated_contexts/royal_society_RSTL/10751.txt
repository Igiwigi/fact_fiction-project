YI 459-76 45975 45995 460-00 It will be observed that there are differences in the meagurements of the fiducial
lines which cannot be accounted for by errors of observation, These differences may
be due to two causes : first, the difficulty of placing every photographic plate in exactly
the same position in the camera ; 8econd, to the alteration in length of the screw of
the dividing engine by change of temperature when the different plates were meagured. That the temperature has some effect upon these measurements appears probable from
the fact that the first dozen or 80 of photographs which were measured on consecutive
days give those readings which agree most closely. The dividing engine could not be
kept always in the 8ame room, and on its removal it was probably snbjected to 8mall

changes of temperature such as would very nearly account for the discrepancy in the
readings.
