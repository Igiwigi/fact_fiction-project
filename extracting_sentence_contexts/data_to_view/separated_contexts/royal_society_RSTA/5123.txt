As
mentioned before, a new scale is generated dynamically in this case. Even if the mass paraemters
of the up and down quarks were set to zero, we would still have protons and neutrons with
masses approximately equal to those we observe. Incidentally, what makes the study of the strong
interactions hard is the fact that

A large fraction of the mass of protons and neutrons has its origin in this quantum phenomenon
of confinement. Finally, we should take into account that for most nuclei, their mass is obtained by summing
the masses of their constituent protons and neutrons (up to a relatively small but very important
binding energy). This implies that apart from identical particles effects, the protons and neutrons
keep their identities inside nuclei.
