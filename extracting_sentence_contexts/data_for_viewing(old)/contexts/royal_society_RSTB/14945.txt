Ashley and Chandler Bridge formations of South Carolina
(USA) were studied in CCNHM and ChM collections, and
discovered by a number of different individuals.

(c) Sampling

We focused on species represented by multiple individuals and a
range of ontogenetic stages, including fetuses and neonates. This
seemed particularly important given the substantial intraspecific


variation in the interparietal within some mammalian species
[23-26] and the fact that its presence can be more readily recog-
nized in younger individuals that have unfused sutures [15].
Unfortunately, only a few extant cetacean species meet these
criteria, and they are all within a single clade, Delphinoidea.
Somewhat surprisingly, one of the oldest and most archaic
fossil odontocetes, Olympicetus avitust, met these criteria. The
holotype of this species (LACM 149156) is a juvenile, a referred
specimen (LACM 126010) is slightly younger [27], and a
second referred specimen (CCNHM 1000) may represent a neo-
nate or perinate [20]. The CCNHM collection includes partial
skulls of seven additional specimens likely representing
perinates, neonates or young calves (CCNHM 8713, 8714,
8716-8719) and one subadult (CCNHM 6059). Among extant
