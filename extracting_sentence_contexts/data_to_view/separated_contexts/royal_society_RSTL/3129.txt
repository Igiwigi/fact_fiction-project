A pendulum clock regulated by mean time at Paris was found
by M. Ricnes to lose two minutes a day at Cayenne, within 5* of the equator. Now
the length of a pendulum that oscillates in a given time is an exact measure of gravity;
and the fact observed by M. Rricnzs proved that, if a heavy body were carried from
Paris to Cayenne, it would lose some part of its weight. On learning this fact,
HuvyGnexs conjectured that it was caused by the centrifugal force arising from the
daily revolution of the earth ; the intensity of this force varying in different latitudes
at different distances from the axis of rotation.
