It would of
course be of great interest to see whether the primitive calicle, in the developing
Heliopora colony, forms calcareous septa. Healiopora having 80 commonly twelve septa, and in conjunction with these eight
mesenteries, it was at first thought that here some key would be found to the eluci-
dation of the question of the relations of the tetrameral corals to the Hexactinians ;
but no definite arrangement of the eight mesenteries to the twelve septa could be
discovered. Lupwi6 and PouRTALES have concluded that the tetrameral condition in the
Rugosa is the result of a modification of an originally hexameral arrangementâ€”that
the Rugosa are, in fact, modifications of the Hexactinian type. Kuyrn, however, using
similar methods, has come to an opposite conclusion. Now that it is known that an
Alcyonarian exists which constructs a s0lid calcareous corallum, in histological structure
scarcely, if at all, to be distinguished from that of many Madreporaria, and that this
Alcyonarian also possesses marked calcareous septa, which septa show, notwithstanding
