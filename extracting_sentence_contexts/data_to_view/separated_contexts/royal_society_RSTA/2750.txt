A, C. DIXON ON STURM-LIOUVILLE HARMONIC EXPANSIONS. In this expression the parts depending on F, F, are separately negligible by
Hopson’s theorem, except for values of ¢ between a+, and for such values
J (t)—f (x) is small and F—F, is finite. The whole is therefore arbitrarily small and,
in fact, zero; thus if the one expansion is valid for f(a), so is the other,* provided
that f(«) is continuous at «.

21. Again, the error produced in one of the functions ¢, y, ®, ¥ by neglecting or
altering « is relatively of the order of \~**, and thus it follows that if F, F, are
functions of the present type (§19) the same except for a change in ¢ then
F(t, #, R)—F, (¢,7, R) is limited. Similarly, then, the expansibility of f(a) is not
affected by a change in the value of o in the fundamental integral equations (3) so
long as {| o|dx exists and f(a) is continuous at x.
