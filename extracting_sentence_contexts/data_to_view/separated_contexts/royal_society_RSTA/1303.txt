The dimensionless particle-volume
distribution function F versus the dimensionless volume of crystals z; = z at a fixed value of time t = 0.021. The curves are
plotted for ellipsoidal and spherical crystals with allowance for the Meirs nucleation kinetics. The physical parameters used in
calculations correspond to figure 3 and p = 2.1. (Online version in colour.)

is explained by the fact that crystals evolve and compensate the melt supercooling so that already
existing particles continue their gradual growth, and the appearance of new crystals is inhibited
by partially removed supercooling. In addition, the distribution function for ellipsoidal crystals
is lower than for spherical particles at the same values of modified time variable x1. Eliminating the modified time x; by means of expression (4.7) (see also figure 8b), we
demonstrate in figure 10 the dimensionless supercooling and distribution function depending
on real dimensionless variables t and z;.
