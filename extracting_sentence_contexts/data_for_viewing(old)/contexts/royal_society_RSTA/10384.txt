of brothers per family dealt with, and is very slightly larger than parental
correlation.

(vi.) The theory of the midparent for a considerable number of couplets approaches
closely that originally given by Francis Garon, except for extreme values of the
character, when the regression becomes rapidly smaller and ultimately vanishes.

We thus see that a generalised theory of the pure gamete would be of very great
advantage if it could be accepted. It would lead to a system of inheritance in
randomly mating populations with non-differential fertility, which in its broad
features would be essentially the same as that which has been biometrically
developed not from theoretical hypotheses, but from the statistical description of
observed facts in populations.

Unfortunately, however, when we come to the actual numerical values for the
coefticients of heredity deducible from such a theory of the pure gamete, they do not
accord with observation. They diverge in two ways: First, they give a rigid value
for these coefficients for all races and charactersâ€”a result not in reasonable
accordance with observation. Secondly, they give values distinctly too small, as

compared with the average values, or with the modal values of large series of
population observations.

We thus reach the point we have so often had to insist upon: that the biometric
or statistical theory of heredity does not involve a denial of any physiological theory
