The presence of lime may
be accounted for by supposing, that in a preliminary opera-
tion, the cuticle, which, as I before stated, could not be
detected in any part of the body, except the: head and the
extremity of the toes, and has been found invariably wanting
in all other mummies, was removed by means of that alka-
line substance: This'-circumstance again goes' far to how
that the Egyptian embalmers ' were acquainted with 'an
important physiological truth, namely, that in order to pro-
mote the absorption of liquid substances, particularly of the
tanning liquor and saline solution, applied "to the external
surface of the body, the cuticle must first be removed. The' presence of saline -substances in mummies has” been
noticed by more than one modern writer, especially by Mons:
Rover, already mentioned in the course of this essay ; but
the conjecture as to the origin of the salts themselves, has not
been hinted at before. A fourth fact, deserving of our attention, is the presence of
a resino-bituminous substance between some of the folds of
the remaining portions of the peritoneal membrane. On col-
lecting this substance, and instituting some experiments upon
it, I ascertained that the bitumen was mixed with a greater
proportion of wax, 80 as to have rendered the mixture per-
fectly plastic. To have penetrated thus far, and to have
lodged between closely adhering membraneous folds, this mix-
ture must either have been injected/quite warm into the cavity
of the abdomen, or the- body itself must have' been plunged
intoa vessel containing aliquefied mixture of wax and bitumen,
and there kept for some hours or days, over a gentle fire.
