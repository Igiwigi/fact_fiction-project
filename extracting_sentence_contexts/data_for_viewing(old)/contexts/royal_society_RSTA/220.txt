(1) Information retrieval. Gathering of relevant texts.

(2) Information extraction. Looking within the retrieved texts to identify,
extract and structure a range of specific types of information or facts.

(3) Data mining. Finding associations among the pieces of information
extracted from many different texts.

Thus, text mining can dramatically reduce the amount of work required by
the userâ€”instead of being presented with potentially tens of thousands of
documents to sift through and comb for relevant knowledge, text mining offers
the possibility of automatically extracting and presenting to the user precise facts
retrieved from relevant documents. Furthermore, interesting associations may
be found among disparate extracted facts, leading to the discovery of new or
unsuspected knowledge.

Within the ASSIST project, several text-mining technologies have been used
to support the tasks expected by users of the eep. Each technology either provides
