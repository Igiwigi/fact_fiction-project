Tf it did not appear to me superfluous, I could enumerate other instances of stony
Elayers which have congealed on slopes of from 10? to 15®, and even higher angles in
Sother parts of the great volcano; but the cases already cited will establish, as a rule, the
gfact that lava is capable of solidifying and forming stony and continuous layers on slopes
Seven steeper than those on which loose cinders and lapilli can settle. These last may

accumulate at an angle of 40?, or even more, for I have seen scoriz settle on a slope of
£42* before my eyes in the recent cone built up in October and November 1857, within
Sthe crater of Vesuvius ; but in this instance the lava was in a state of semi-fusion when
Mt fell, and the separate fragments may have been soldered together.

» I will now briefly sum up some of the leading conclusions to which we have been led
Sby the facts described in the foregoing pages, or first part of this memoir. E lst. Lavas which consolidate on steep slopes at angles varying from 15® to 40?, do not
Sconsist of a confused mass of scorize or of fragmentary matter, but of distinct parts,
Znamely, an upper and lower mass of scoriz, with an intermediate stony layer,
