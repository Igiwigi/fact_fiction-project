2° in the south-eastern area. Temperature has not fallen much in the north-east,
but south-west of Iceland the 10° line has moved a long way to the south-east.
This line keeps its position in lat. 50° N. on the 40th meridian, but to the north
temperature has fallen in this longitude—note the movement of the 5° isothermal.

The salinity observations are, unfortunately, not very numerous for this month,
being the last. They are sufficient, however, to show an immense extension of the
fresh-water area east and south-east of Newfoundland, and some increase of salinity
in the south-eastern and eastern areas.

The most important facts are therefore the extension south-eastward of the cold
and fresh area from Newfoundland, and the fall of temperature, and probably also of
salinity, in the region south-east and south of Greenland.

Except near the United States coast, temperature and salinities are lower in 1897
than in 1896, and this difference is greatly exaggerated east and south-east of New-
foundland, In the east and south-east temperature and salinity are higher than
in 1896. The line of 8° runs along the east side of the Faeroe-Shetland Channel
instead of the west, but the line of 7° is rather more to the north, and the salinity
seems practically the same.
