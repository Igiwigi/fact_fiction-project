the spectal or non-relief effects produced on the sensitive luminous discharge
by conneeting it with the air-spark terminal. In the present section we shall at firs; sappose the intermittence to be caused by
an interruption in the circuit between the source of electricity and the positive
terminal of the tube. For convenience we shall express this fact by calling the
positive terminal the arr-spark terminal. If we connect a wire with a piece of tinfoil placed upon the tube, and connect the
wire with any independent conducting system, we shall obtain, as we have seen, more
or less complete forms of the relief-effect. Both the wire and tinfoil will, in the
majority of cases, repel the luminous column.
