Son would be strictly applicable only to our typical glacier, but is sufficient to explain
how, in the actual case of a glacier, the facility of its sliding may increase its power to
overcome the obstacles to its motion by the fracturing of its mass.

I have chosen the simplest cases for the purpose of more easily explaining the manner
in which the $liding of a glacier increases the dislocating power of the forces acting upon
it. In the more complicated cases, in which C and E are taken into account at consider-
able depths, we shall obtain greater values of the tearing and crushing forces p, and ps.
It is the latter which will be principally increased at greater depths. Still it must not
be supposed that the mere increase of weight can explain the apparent difficulty already
suggested (art. 60), viz., Why, when the mass has been crushed and-then immediately
regealed under the existing conditions at any proposed point, it should again be crushed
at the same point. This 8cond crushing does not, in fact, take place under the same
pressure as that under which the regelation took place. This latter process occurs when
the pressure depending on the angular distortion of the element, or on the force F, has

been destroyed by the previous crushing ; and then the angular distortion, the force F,
and the increase of the maximum pressure are reproduced, and the mass is crushed again.
We thus understand how the alternate processes of crushing and regelation must be
repeated when the mass is in motion, though the weight alone of the mass, however
great, might not, and probably would not, if unaided by the distortion arising from the
motion, be sufficient to crush any even the lowest portions of the glacier, any more than
