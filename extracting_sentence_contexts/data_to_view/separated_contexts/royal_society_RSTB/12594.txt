On the one hand, too
low interactions and FGF-signalling leads to an extremely
stretched placode, while too low activity of SDFla related
receptors results in an extremely compacted primordium. It
would be highly interesting and useful to compare these
numerical outcomes with experimental results. It would in

fact either validate the proposed model and the underlying
assumptions, or (hopefully) suggest which refinements are
necessary to improve its realism and predictive potential. Of course, there are still several aspects that require further
investigation to completely understand and control the pro-
cesses underlying the development of zebrafish PLL. One of
these aspects is the mechanisms regulating the selection
of PM cells that will undergo activation thereby triggering
rosette formation.
