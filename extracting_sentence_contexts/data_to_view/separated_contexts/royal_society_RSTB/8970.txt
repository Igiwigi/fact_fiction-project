The work from Harris & Pettit [26]
already supported this idea by demonstrating that synaptic
and extrasynaptic NMDARs represent distinct and stable
pools of receptors at the surface of CA1 neurons in hippocam-
pal slices. Making sharp delineation of synaptic and extrasynaptic spaces
is challenging, especially when one tries to reconcile data from
microscopy and electrophysiology. This difficulty arises from
the fact that what one considers as extrasynaptic based on
morphological clues can still be part of the synaptic space as
far as signal transmission is concerned. From the morphologi-
cal point of view, receptors are often considered extrasynaptic
if they lie more than 100 nm away from the post-synaptic den-
sity (PSD) [22,23]. However, this morphological definition 4.
