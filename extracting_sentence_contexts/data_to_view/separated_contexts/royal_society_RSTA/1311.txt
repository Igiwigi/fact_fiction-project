In sequential decision problems, it is often
the case that exogenous forecast information is presented to the controller at regular intervals. Given the key role of Markov decision processes (MDPs) in the computation of optimal policies
in such settings, a full accounting of the impact of future forecast information requires introducing
the forecasts into the Markov state variable, thereby leading to potential high-dimensional
state representations. Another fundamental issue relates to the fact that the forecasts should be
‘compatible’ with the state variable that is being forecast (e.g. weather), so that the forecasted state
variable (i.e. the state variable for which forecasts are available) and the forecasts themselves
should exhibit self-consistent dynamics. To gain some appreciation for this issue, note that the
s-period forecast must contain information that implicitly ‘peeks’ s periods into the future of the
underlying state space model, so that the s-period forecast implicitly constrains the dynamics of
the underlying model over the next s periods. These constraints need to be built into the joint
dynamics in such a way that the Markov structure is preserved.
