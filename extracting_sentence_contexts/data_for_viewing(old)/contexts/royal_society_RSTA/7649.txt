of which it is difficult to estimate the influence. Such factors are the details of the
local and distant topography, the nature of the building on which the instrument is
mounted, the bearing of the wall on which the instrument is mounted relative to the
direction of the focus from the station, and other factors. As a first approximation
we assume that the amplitude recorded by the Jaggar shock recorders varies inversely
as the distance of the focus from the station and is independent of the other factors.

In the case of distant earthquakes the variation of amplitude with 1 /r can be regarded
as a roughly verified empirical rule. The question has been discussed theoretically by
a number of authors (LAMB 1904; JEFFREYS 1927, 1935), and it has been shown that
such a relation should hold only for a bodily wave undisturbed by discontinuities.
This relationship should be seriously affected by reflected waves. For a plane free
surface the displacement in P or SV should vary as 1/r?. The fact that the observed
motion is better represented by 1/r than by any other simple power relationship
suggests that there are other factors influencing the amplitude which have not been
allowed for in the theory.

In the case of surface waves the assumed variation also appears to be reasonable.
The total energy crossing a line element at a distance r from the focus should be
inversely proportional to 1/r. Since the time of passage of the waves past the element
