The
weighted mean of the Doppler widths of figure 2 gives the extraordinary result of 1.8 ppm in
terms of statistical uncertainty (calculated as the standard deviation of the weighted mean), but
the value itself is affected by a negative shift. This is the clear consequence of the fact that line
narrowing effects are not taken into account properly by the simplified model. In fact, using the

Figure 1. Ratio between Doppler and collisional widths as a function of the gas pressure, for all the molecular lines that have Dw

been either used or proposed for a spectroscopic determination of the Boltzmann constant. The higher the ratio is, the less :
sophisticated the spectral analysis is required to be.
