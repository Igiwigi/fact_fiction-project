ing nothing in common with us, but endued with a power of
exciting, and a sense that perceives vibrations of the same
nature indeed as those which constitute our ordinary sounds,
but 5so remote, that the animals who perceive them may be
8aid to possess another sense, agreeing with our own solely
in the medium by which it is excited, and possibly wholly
unaffected by those slower vibrations of which we are
sensible.

this Society with idle speculations on mere possible modes of
existence, and should not have called its attention to this
subject, had I not observed several curious facts which 1
thought might prove interesting, and may serve to justify
some latitude of conjecture beyond the strict evidence of our
8enses.
