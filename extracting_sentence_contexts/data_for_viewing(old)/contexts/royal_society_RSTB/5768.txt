BS The substance appears to be a dimethoxy-hydroxy-phthalic acid.

RS That it is a true phthalic acid derivative and not an iso- or tere-phthalic acid derivative
& seems to be indicated by the following fact: A small amount of the dimethoxy-
=I hydroxy-phthalic acid was heated in an open test tube in a castor oil bath, the tempera-

é ture of which was maintained at 180°-200° C. Water was given off, as evidenced
3 by the condensation of moisture on the cool parts of the tube. A substance sublimed
3 (Product ©), with apparent gaseous decomposition, in the form of beautiful long white
g needles some of which were half a centimetre long. These melted at 203°-204° C.
S without decomposition but with partial sublimation during heating. It was readily

soluble in water but gave no colour with aqueous ferric chloride.

Product B was definitely proved to be a true phthalic acid derivative as follows:
A quantity of the dry material was dissolved in dry ether and ethylated by treatment
