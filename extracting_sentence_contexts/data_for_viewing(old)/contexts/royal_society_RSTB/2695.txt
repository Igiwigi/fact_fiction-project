mammals there is no genus actually restricted to the Himalayas, but 4lurus is
nearly so, and it is distinctly Holarctic in affinity as is shown by extinct forms
having been met with in Europe. Tylototriton, with a similar range to dlurus, has
strong Holarctic relationships. Amongst birds there are only two peculiar genera
belonging to the Transgangetic Paradoxornithinw and Liotrichine, Conostoma and
Myzornis, and the only other distinctly Oriental form in the list of those restricted
to the Himalayas is Callene. Tickellia, Horites and Oreocorys are of uncertain
affinity, but the two latter are probably Holarctic rather than Oriental. The
finches Pyrroplectes, Procarduelis, and Callacanthis, and the gallinaceous genera
Catreus and Ophrysia ave characteristically Holaretic.

Now, although it cannot be stated as a definite fact that the oldest inhabitants
of a region present the greatest amount of peculiarity and furnish the largest
number of distinct generic types, there is much probability in this being the rule,
and if it is, it follows necessarily that the Holarctic members of the Himalayan
fauna have inhabited the area longer than the Indo-Malay contingent, as is
probable for other reasons.

14-17. Assam and Burma.

This includes the whole area from the base of the Eastern Himalayas in Assam,
and farther east, from the limits of British territory on the north to the latitude
of Mergui (about 12° 30’ N. lat.) on the south. The western boundary is formed by
the Gangetic alluvium and the Bay of Bengal, the eastern by Chinese and Siamese
