never showed any such discrepancy. In these the difference was always such that the
dorsal end of the block was positive to the ventral end. It is needless to give
examples of this now, for the experiments which will be given will afford convincing
proof of the truth of this statement; but it may be stated that in 45 instances
in which the organ-current of a cut strip or block of tissue was observed and noted
there is no instance of the current being otherwise than +-, and that in all cases the
strength of the current far exceeded that which was observed in the case of the entire
animal,

The difference observed very early in the work between the organ-current in the eut-
out block of tissue, and that in the organ when in situ, suggested the view that the
increased current found to be present in the former tissue was dependent upon the
nature of the preparation—upon the fact that the piece of organ used was bounded by
incisions. It was, therefore, determined to ascertain how far such incisions did affect
the result. For this purpose the following experiment was carried out :-—A medium-
sized Torpedo, 18 centims. long by 12 wide, and 15 millims. thick at the median border
of the organ, was fixed on a perforated vertical board; the brain had been previously
destroyed, but the other parts of the fish remained intact. The skin covering the
dorsal and ventral surfaces of the right organ was now led off by kaolin plugs,
the leading-off points being situated in the middle of the length of the organ, and
5 millims. outside its median border; and care was taken that the one electrode should
be exactly opposite the other. The dorsal surface was found to be negative to the
ventral; the difference of potential was, however, quite inconsiderable, and amounted
to — ‘001 Raoutr.
