188 Dr. BURNEY's Account of

ſuch as God ſave great GEORGE 0ur Ring; Let ambition
fire thy mind; and The Eafter Hymn; with which, and
ſach chords as were pleaſing to his ear, he uſed to try the
perfeftion of his inſtrument. I have been favoured with ſeveral particulars concern-
ing his ſon's firſt attention to muſic from ROBERT PAR-
TRIDGE, efquire, a gentleman of rank in the Corpora-
tion of Norwich, who, at my requeſt, has been fo oblig-
ing as to aſcertain many curious facts, the truth of which,
had they reſted merely on the authority of the child's
father or mother, might have been ſuſpected; and tranſ-
ations out of the common courſe of nature cannot be
too ſcrupulouſly or minutely proved. My correſpondent, of whoſe intelligence and veracity
I have the higheſt opinion, teNls me, that T may reſt
aflured of the authenticity of ſuch circumſtances as he
relates from the information of the child's father, who is
an ingenious mechanic, of good reputation, whom he
knows very well, and frequently employs, as theſe cir-
cumftances are confirmed by the teſtimony of many who
were witneſſes of the child's early performance; and he
adds, that he has himſelf feen and heard moſt of the
very extraordinary efforts of his genius,

About Chriſtmas 1776, when the child was only a
year and a half old, he diſcovered a great inclination for

muſic,

muſic, by leaving even his food to attend to it when the
organ was playing: and about Midſummer 1777 he
would touch the key-note of his particular favourite
tunes, in order to perſuade his father to play them.
