The FVSMS has been designed to handle structures with variable material properties, which
has been exploited to avoid the potential complications that could arise from using a body

fitted finite-element mesh, where progressing solidification may necessitate remeshing. This was
achieved by also solving structural mechanics in a region surrounding the structure, using a
functionally zero Young’s modulus value for the liquid, a million times smaller than the value
used inside the solid. This assumes that a material with a sufficiently small Young’s modulus
approximates liquid behaviour and offers no significant resistance to the movement of the solid
structure. Note that we could in fact solve fluid flow on the same mesh, simply using a change of
variables, with velocities replacing displacements stored at cell faces—a planned future extension.

The structural mechanics problem can then be defined by the local material properties and
application of force within this domain, which are themselves defined by the solid fraction and
concentration values provided for each volume by the CA method. A similar method has been
applied by Uehara et al. [34], using a finite-element method with a fixed mesh to avoid the
remeshing issue described, updating the material properties at the nodes as the domain solidifies.

(c) Cell orientation and model coupling :3
The code allows for the crystallographic orientation of dendrites to vary spatially, so that each : S
cell comprising the structure has a local crystallographic orientation 6 inherited from a parent : i
cell which can be updated using local displacements obtained from the FVSMS. This allows ae
