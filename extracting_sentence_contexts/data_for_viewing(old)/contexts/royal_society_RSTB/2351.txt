intercellular spaces through the cell-walls of the assimilating parenchyma, ‘The
penetration of these cell-membranes must necessarily be preceded by the solution of
the gas, and any phenomena of diffusion which take place between this point and
the assimilating centres must be referred to liquid and not to gaseous diffusion.

GrauHaM, in his Bakerian Lecture of 1850 (‘Chemical and Physical Researches,’
p. 446), showed that the “liquid diffusion of carbonic acid is a slow process compared
with its gaseous diffusion, quite as much as days are to minutes.” We have in this
fact something more than a suggestion of where we may expect to find the point of
greatest resistance in the path of the carbon dioxide on its way from the outer air to
the chlorophyll corpuscles, and where at any rate one important “ throttle-valve ” of
the assimilatory process is situated.

The accelerating action of a multi-perforate diaphragm on a diffusive flow is
independent of the direction of the flow, so that the arrangement which we find in
the leaf is as efficient in promoting the egress of the excess of oxygen liberated
during assimilation, and the carbon dioxide evolved during the respiratory process,
as it is in promoting the ingress of the atmospheric carbon dioxide itself.

It remains now to be seen how far the transpiration of water through the leaf
stomates may be regarded as a phenomenon of diffusion. Any outward molecular
