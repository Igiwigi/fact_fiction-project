With it, this jet develops a
second maximum in the stable layer at 200m, and re-intensifies later at about 600m. There is
only a very shallow layer near the surface of weaker winds, though the layer of backed wind
is much more distinct. It is conceivable that discrepancies between modelled and observed wind
behaviour is contributed to by the fact that many anemometers are not located at 10 m, and reports
are corrected to 10m using a relatively simple correction. However, it must be emphasized that,
although the flow is weak, there is considerable mesoscale structure in the low-level flow field.

5. Summary and conclusion

The direct impact of the 20 March 2015 eclipse on UK weather has been evaluated using
simulations performed with a high-resolution state-of-the-art numerical weather forecast model
with and without the eclipse.
