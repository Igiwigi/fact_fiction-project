Otherwise, we get

For example, when M coincides with RÂ°, we find A= vx. The choice of the relation (5.2) points
out that the microstructural descriptor is insensitive to rigid translations in space of the whole
body. In fact, v at a point describes what is inside the material element placed there: it brings
information about the inner structure, which translates with the point and changes independently
of the translation itself. Isometric-type changes in observers pertain also to the space where we select the reference
configuration. Let w the value at x and t of a vector field over the reference space.
