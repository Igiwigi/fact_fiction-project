elapse before the surface again hardens. Hence, if the effect in question is due to the
skin, a considerable variation was to be expected.

The test again gave straight line graphs, as follows :-—

vy = 7:4316T-+-0-59118 on loading,
and
ry = 0-72348 on unloading.

The divergences in the constants from O,, are less than many which we have found
to occur between different sets of observations on the same specimen. ;

Tt would seem therefore that we cannot account for the facts observed on this theory
if we rely on the skin and core to produce the effect observed.

We are thus driven to the conclusion that if the explanation above given is correct,
xylonite is an intimate mixture of two materials with different elastic and plastic pro-
perties and different stress-optical coefficients. This does not appear, in itself, inherently
improbable ; and it is further possible that the two materials are allotropic modifications
of the same substance, and that their proportions are altered by the action of stress and
other causes. ‘This might account for the observed divergences in the values of a and
8 under different conditions.
