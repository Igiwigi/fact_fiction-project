The dynamical response of most lasers used in applications and laboratories can be analysed
by considering two coupled rate equations for the intensity I of the laser field and the inversion
of population D. In dimensionless form, they are given by [40]

dl
ap =i-1+D) (4.1)
aP _ (A —DU +0) (42)

dt


where A = O(1) is the control parameter and y = O(10-) is a ratio of two physical time constants.
The fact that y is small explains why the laser is weakly stable and exhibits slowly damped
oscillations [40]. Consider now the following model for two intermediates X and Y and constant
product B:

1
B=Y
-1

X+Y— 52x (4.3)

3
xX—C
