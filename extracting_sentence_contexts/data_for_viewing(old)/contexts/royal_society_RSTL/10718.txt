the other ; they all cross the roots of the oculomotorii at right angles and plainly
do not join them. The greater number of the fibres entering into the compoxsition
of this commissure are derived from the second layer of the optic lobe. In fact it
may be considered as the commissure of the optic lobe, but in addition to these fibres
zome few appear to be derived ſrom the lateral columns of the cord.

In the Rays this commissure is not 80 well developed as in Scyllium and Acanthias.
Tn the latter it extends farther behind the oculomotorii than in the others. Tt seems
as if, in these latter, the extent of these association fibres compensates for the s8ize of
the ventricles and the consequent thinness of the walls of the optic lobe, cerebrum,
and the other parts of the brain.

Fourth pair.—The trochleares are very difficult to trace ; they have a distinct
deeussation in the region of the valyula, cerebelli, which is represented by a narrow
S neck of tisxue between the cerebellum and the optic lobe, and is nob nearly 80 well
