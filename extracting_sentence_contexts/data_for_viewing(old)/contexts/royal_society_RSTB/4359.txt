Fig. 27 of this paper evidently corresponds to such sections as those of which Tomes
(11, p. 113) has given the following deseription :—

“Tt will be noticed that in these oblique sections, the partitions of the honeycomb

are well stained, as they usually are; but as we progress further into the more formed
enamel, the corresponding areas become light, and it is the contained fibre alone that
is stained. In fact the septa have almost disappeared under the action of the
decaleifying acid, and still further, in yet more developed enamel, they quite disappear,
leaving the fibres free.”

Also, “In the openings of the honeycomb dark bodies, the fibres cut across occur in
many places, whilst in others they have fallen out ; but enough remains to show their
identity with the row of dark oval bodies which, with light interspaces, constitute the
older more solid portion.”
© Evidently the areas seen in fig. 27 (e.7.) are identical with those which Tomes
‘\ deseribes as fibres, and which, in his opinion, are prolongations of the ameloblastic
*g cytoplasm usually termed Tomes’ processes. :

2 As stated earlier in this paper, I believe we have the strongest evidence that Tomes’
