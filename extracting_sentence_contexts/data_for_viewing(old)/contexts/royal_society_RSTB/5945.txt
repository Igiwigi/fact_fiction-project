simultaneously with I,. This was probably because the operation was made very
early in the plastochron, as was pointed out in section 17. I,a was joined to I,k but
not to I,. The wound was very nearly median. I, was displaced towards P,, in the
anodic direction, instead of in the kathodic direction as in sub-group 2. This was shown

by the angle P,-I, which was only 71° instead of 87°-4, as in a normal plant ; and also
by the contacts made by I, with P, and P,. For its central vascular strand had been
displaced away from the stipular strand of P, and lay within the edge of P,, as is shown
in fig. 20. The displacement of I, was no doubt due to the fact that I,a, which arose
before I,, had occupied part of the area which would otherwise have been occupied by
the kathodic stipule of I,. I,a appeared to be inserted slightly lower than Ik. The
manner in which these two leaves were joined was similar to that in which I,a and I,
were joined in No. 5, already described, for the anodic stipule of I,k was turned back-
wards and outwards so that it was joined by its morphologically upper surface to the
upper surface of Ia.
