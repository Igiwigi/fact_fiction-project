The thickness of
the woody zone at the internode is about +05. At its narrowest part the thickness of
the bark is 025, whilst it becomes very much thicker at the nodes. It has in fact been
a rather thick parenchymatous layer, in which the cells were very irregular both in size
and distribution. Some few cells of large size appear dispersed amongst others of smaller
dimensions. There is no trace of linear or other special arrangement of these cells,
either in the transvyerse (fig. 9) or yertical (fig. 10) sections.
