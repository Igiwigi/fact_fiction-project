by plants, s0 far as they depend upon the influence of light, are affected in the greatest
degree by the most luminous rays, and that all the functions of the vegetable economy,
which are owing to the presence of this agent, follow in that respect the same law.
And this is just what we ought to expect, if we suppose that light acts upon the vege-
table, as it does upon the animal kingdom, in the character of a specific stimulus ; for
we all are sensible, that the vivifying influence of light upon ourselves is in proportion
to its brightness ; nor is it uninteresting to remark, that rays of the very description
which most abound in solar light, are at once the most cheering to the animal crea-
tion, and the most conducive to the growth and well-being of the vegetable.

We have already seen, that even that most intense form of artificial light which is
emitted from incandescent lime, produces no sensi√æble influence upon plants ; and we
are reminded, that the same holds good with respect to animals, by the fact said to
have been observed by the exhibitors of the oxyhydrogen microscope, namely, that
animalcules of kinds which used to be speedily destroyed by the too stimulating
action of solar light, appear to suffer much less from that now substituted, provided
the water in which they are immersed does not become heated thereby.

Parr II. On the Action of Plants upon the Atmosphere.

Having now considered the mode in which light may be supposed to operate upon
plants, I shall next proceed to examine the extent of the changes wrought in the con-
stitution of the atmosphere by the latter, under the influence of this agent.

T say the extent of the changes produced, because no one denies the nature of this
