hydrolysis by emulsin. It is the first member of the class of dextrose ethers
(glucosides) of eyanhydrins which has so far been found in nature, amygdalin and
lotusin being maltose derivatives.

The Enzyme of Sorghum vulgare.

In the introduction to this paper attention has been drawn to the fact that the
plant when moistened with cold water evolves hydrocyanic acid, whilst it no longer
does so after exposure to a temperature of 100Â°, nor is the acid formed when the
plant is placed in boiling water. These results point to the presence in the plant of
an enzyme, destroyed by heat, which has the power of hydrolysing dhurrin. This
enzyme was isolated by extracting the finely-ground plant with cold water, and
evaporating the extract so obtained in a vacuous desiccator over quicklime to remove
as much hydrocyanic acid as possible. The activity of this extract was then tested
by the addition of small quantities to solutions of amygdalin, salicin and dhurrin,
these experiments being controlled by the addition of boiled and filtered dhurra
extract to similar solutions of these glucosides.

In all three cases the glucoside was quickly hydrolysed, the formation of benzalde-
