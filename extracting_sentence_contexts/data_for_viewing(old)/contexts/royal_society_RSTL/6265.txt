2, From equation (4.) we see that a=; ; and if we represent by « the velocity of the

particle whose place is y, we find
u=Y=0+p logs,

n—C
and * eg We.

3. To determine the arbitrary constant C, we observe that e=g, and u=C are always
simultaneous equations. But the former belongs to the confines of the wave, where in
fact u=0; and therefore C=0. Hence for a wave transmitted through a medium which
is itself at rest beyond the limits of the wave, we have these equations*:—

g=arty/plog.t+e(s) =
0=ar+y/ pt+ap(s) |

* If - and « be eliminated between the equations (7.) and u=+ 4 log a, we shall obtain the equation

u=f{y—wXv pt,

which was first obtained, though in a very different manner from that employed in this paper, by M. Pors80x,
and printed in the Journal of the Polytechnique School, tome yii. Tt seems not to have occurred to him,
however, that by means of this equation he might effect another integration of the equations of fluid motion,
