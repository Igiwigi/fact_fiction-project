in formol-sublimate. A considerable number (but by no means all) of the cells that were
non-pyronin-staining lymphocytes in the formol-sublimate-fixed half were classifiable as
immature pyronin cells in the Helly-fixed half.

(2) Most grafts were found to contain a few lymphocytes which were difficult to classify
because of the faint pyronin-staining of their cytoplasm.

(3) There was a highly significant positive correlation between the cell counts of
lymphocytes and immature plasma cells in the first-set grafts at 8 days (although not at
12 days, or in the second-set grafts) ; no such correlation was found between lymphocytes
and mature plasma cells.

(4) The fact that the second-set grafts had a much higher plasma-cell concentration
than the first set, and at the same time tended to have a lower concentration of lympho-
cytes—so that the total cell concentration of the two was the same—is most simply
explained on the basis of transformation of lymphocytes to plasma cells.

(5) The intimacy of association of the lymphocytes and plasma cells observed in these
grafts and elsewhere by others (cf. Dubois-Ferriére 1951) in itself suggests that they together
form a series and that the transformation may occur in the grafts.

(6) There was in many cases a large increase in the proportion of plasma cells to
lymphocytes between the two stages at which cell counts were made (the eighth and
twelfth day after transplantation). This increase occurred in five out of the eight second-
set graft series and in certain of the first sets which underwent most destruction during the
