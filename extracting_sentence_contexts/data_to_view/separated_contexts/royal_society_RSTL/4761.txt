To form a clear conception of this
phenomenon, we must consider the total action produced by the earth upon a magnet
of any kind, and endeavour to distinguish between the effects of gravitation which
the earth exerts upon the body in virtue of its weight, and those which result from
the magnetic agency. 7. In the first place, it is to be remarked that the magnetic agency of the earth
gives rise to no resultant force of sensible magnitude, upon any magnet with reference
to which we can perform experiments, as is proved by the following observed facts. (1.) A magnet placed in any manner, and allowed to move with perfect freedom in any horizontal
5 direction (by being floated, for example, on the surface of a liquid), experiences no action which
tends to set its centre of gravity in motion, and there is therefore no horizontal force upon the

@ body.
