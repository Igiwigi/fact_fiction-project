The figures in the left hand column give the effect of lengthening the chain by one
carbon atom, and those in the right hand column reflect the change in the internal
polarisation of the molecule due to the substitution of one — CH, group by — COH,
— C,H, CH (OH), or — COOH.

The parameter d may be taken to refer not to the internal polarisation of the molecule
but to the influence of the end group upon the field of the solids, The fact that d = 0
for acids might be taken to mean that the molecules are attached to the metal by the
CH, group because the metal is electro-positive and the COOH group also positive
owing to its replaceable hydrogen, but this suggestion is not applicable to glass.

Why should the effect of a carbon atom in the chain be independent of the length
of the chain? There is at least one parallel case. The heat of crystallisation of long
chain compounds is proportional to the length of the chain (XX1) but the relation is
unusual. So far as I am aware the effect of a change in an end group commonly
decreases as the chain lengthens. For example, when a hydrogen of the — CH; group
of an n— acid is replaced by a negative atom, such as Cl—
