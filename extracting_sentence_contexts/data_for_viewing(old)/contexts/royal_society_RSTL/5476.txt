can be employed for generating the fandamental scale; will be found not.to include
directly the Bezoutiant among the number. There will thus arise two subjects of
inquiry ; 1st, the mode of forming the fundamental scale, and proving its fundamental

D=0 is the condition to be satisfied in order that J may be representable under/the form of ithe -«wny of the
Squares of (m—1) linear functions of 2 and.y, and D itself is an invariant to J, and consequently an invariant
and (as is obvious from its form) a combinantive invariant to F and'p. Moreover, which is more immediately
to the point, we know that the quadratic form Q
