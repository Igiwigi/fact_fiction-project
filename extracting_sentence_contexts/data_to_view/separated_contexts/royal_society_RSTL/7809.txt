On the whole the peculiarities at Damargida, Kalianpur, and Bangalore
Seem to be sufficiently accounted for. The other residual errors in Table VIIL., at
SKaliana and Minicoy, are 80 small that they may be considered evanescent ; and seeing
Shat the local attractions at those places, as shown in the firs: column of Table VIIL.,
=are very large, this result speaks decidedly in favour of the hypothesis. The fact that
Sthe anomalous cireumstance is accounted for by the hypothesis, that a station out at sea
—&xhibits a considerable increase in gravity, although surrounded by the ocean, which has
=" deficiency of attracting matter, is a very strong argument in favour of the hypothesis. Were the exact contour of the continent and the neighbouring sea-bed better known, the
Expplication of this method might be carried out more completely. As it is, however,
Apyhat remains unexplained is not important.”
