It not unfrequently occurs that the Orbulina shell is double or even treble, th

Before discussing the evidence, it will be well to recall the mode of life o
Orbulina.
In common with the rest of the family Globigerinid@, and species of the genus
Pulvinulina among the Rotalide, Orbulina is frequently found leading a pelagi
existence at or near the surface of the sea. When taken in the tow-net, it is often

The fact that all transitional stages are found between small Orbulina she
containing a perfect spire of chambers, and large onés which are empty, appears to
point to the conclusion that the empty Orbulina shells when small contained such
chambers.

What is the relation between the Orbulina shell and the contained chambers?
The suggestion that these constitute a young individual about to be set free i
incompatible with the facts (1) that they are attached to and sometimes involved in
the Orbulina shell; (2) that they are often seen in stages of degeneration ; and (3)
that the largest Orbulina shells are empty and complete.

According to Major Owen’s view, the outer sphere may be regarded as a “ wild
growing closing-in chamber,” and it appears probable that this is the correct inter-
