domly placed clusters of units, results in multiple coexisting
gradients that run in opposite directions on different parts of
the simulated cortex, as is also manifest in the data [16]
(figure 6i,j). Similarly, our simulations show that the convexity
or concavity of the gradient is not universal, but depends on the
spread of the initial state cluster. Overall, the diffusion process
by which we explain numerotopy is not unrelated to the self-
organizing Turing reaction—diffusion model [40], although in
our case, the large-scale topography of number regions only
obtains after smoothing of the selectivity map by a Gaussian
filter. We thus predict that higher-resolution imaging should
uncover a more intertwined topography of number preferences
(see electronic supplementary material, Note S8). The fact that
voxel-level properties such as numerotopy can be accounted
for by exactly the same model as single-cell effects would also
suggest that the approximate number system is self-similar
across scales.

The above model is deliberately abstract and lives in a space
of dimension 1. In a second implementation of our theory, we
aimed to study whether the same properties would hold in a
more realistic model of neuronal dynamics, including a net-
work of excitatory and inhibitory units embedded within a
cortical plane, with sparse and local connectivity (figure 4).
This extended model follows Dale’s principle [37]: units can
