where o = 3aN°/16, A = 51 — 59. It can be also shown that system (3.8) possesses an additional
integral of motion,

H=o(cos*@ + sin*@) + (-1)"V1+ sin20 sin A. (3.9)

In fact, system (3.8) depicts the slow evolution on the plane for stable and unstable branches
of SIM. Further study of the system dynamics will be fully concentrated on the non-stationary
regimes of (3.8) for both cases, i.e. 11—even, odd. In figure 2(a,b), we illustrate the series of phase
portraits of (3.8) for two distinct values of m, namely 1 =0 and m=1, respectively. As is clear
from the phase portraits of figure 2, the regime of full recurrent energy exchange between the
axial and lateral vibrations of the outer element exists above a certain critical value of w=pcR.
Thus, for values of jp =~! below a certain critical value (figure 2a(i), 2b(i)) the LPT (depicted by
the bold solid line; see the definition above and the corresponding [26-28]) emanating from 6 =0
