With improvements to detector sensitivity still ongoing to reach design sensitivity, these
suspensions perform extremely well, reaching violin mode Qs (the inverse of mechanical loss) of
approximately 10° [49], and, as with GEO600, dampers are applied to help with the control of the
suspensions. Virgo has also developed quasi-monolithic suspensions of a slightly different design [53], using
the same CO} laser technology to pull and weld fibres and using HCB for the jointing of interface
pieces (albeit with a different procedure). Virgo in fact implemented this design before aLIGO and
