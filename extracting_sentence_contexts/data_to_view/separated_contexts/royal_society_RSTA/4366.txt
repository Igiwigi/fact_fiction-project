This,
however, is only a slight modification of the former method ; it, again, has no element
of generality. Another plan would be to differentiate the three equations up to any order with
the hope of determining all the derivatives of the highest order that occur in
terms of derivatives of lower order. If this were possible, substitution in the
equations of differential elements such as

dl = adx + hdy + gdz

and suecessive integration would ultimately lead to v. It appears in general, how-
ever, that relations of interdependence among the equations prevents them from

being adequate for the purpose at any stage; the relations are, in fact, satisfied
conditions of compatibility. This method is, therefore, ineffective. An effective method can, however, be obtained as follows.
