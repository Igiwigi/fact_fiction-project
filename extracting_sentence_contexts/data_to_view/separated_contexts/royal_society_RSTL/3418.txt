In all these cases the results were the
same as those already given with the combinations of platinum and iron.

1838. It is necessary that due precaution be taken to have the arrangements in an
unexceptionable state. It often happened that the first immersion of the Plates gave
deflections ; it is, in fact, almost impossible to put two plates of the same metal into
the solution without causing a deflection ; but this generally goes off very quickly,
and then the arrangement may be used for the investigation (1826.). Sometimes
there is a feeble but rather permanent deflection of the needle; thus when platinum
and palladium were the metals, the first effect fell and left a current able to deflect
the galvanometer-needle 3?, indicating the platinum to be positive to the palladium,
This effect of 3?, however, is almost nothing compared to what a mere thermo
current can cause, the latter producing a deflection of 60* or more ; besides which, even
supposing it an essential effect of the arrangement, it is in the wrong direction for
the contact theory. I rather incline to refer it to that power which platinum and other
substances have of effecting combination and decomposition without themselves en-
tering into union ; and I have occasionally found that when a platinum plate has been
left for some hours in a strong solution of sulphuret of potassium (1812.) a small
quantity of sulphur has been deposited upon it.
