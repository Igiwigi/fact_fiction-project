It seems probable that at high
altitudes the mean oxygen pressure in the blood passing through the lung capillaries
is insufficient to effect the normal amount of oxidation of these easily oxidisable
substances. The result of this will be that they are present in abnormal amounts in
the blood, and may either act directly as a stimulus to the blood-forming and other
organs, and to the lung epithelium, or else act indirectly by continuing to consume
oxygen after the arterial blood has left the lungs, and thus lowering seriously the
oxygen tension before this blood reaches the tissues. Against this indirect action
is the fact that the lips and faces of acclimatised persons on Pikeâ€™s Peak seemed to be
of a particularly bright healthy colour. In favour of it, on the other hand, was the
particularly cyanosed appearance of some of the newcomers. It was difficult to
imagine that the blood as it left their lungs could be so blue as to account for the
colour of their lips.
