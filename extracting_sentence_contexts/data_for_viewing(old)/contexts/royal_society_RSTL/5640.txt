the spherical membrane enclosing the embryo, but are inside it, and are seen through it.
Very similar also is the hatching of many Annelids, in which also the young animal quits
the egg, as an egg-shaped body without any external organs except cilia, by means of
which it swims with activity.

This, however, does not show any disparity in the two cases, for the development of
the cilia is probably connected with the free condition of the young animal, and with
the tendency to the production of these important organs in the Annelids, and their
constant absence in the Crustacea.

It would appear, therefore, that the Daphnia, 80 far from undergoing no metamor-
phosis, does, in fact, enter the world in a very rudimental condition, and that only after
the first change of skin does it assume the well-known characters of the genus. In fact,
