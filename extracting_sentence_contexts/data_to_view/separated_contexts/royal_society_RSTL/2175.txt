ScyegLE), I HAUT obſerved, that litmus is no teſt of
the ſaturation of this acid by alkalies ; for the infuſion of lit-'
mus added to fuch a mixture will turn red; when the liquor
appears to be highly alkaline, by its turning the infuſions of
violets, roſe leaves, and moſt other red juices, green. This
does not proceed from the infuſion of litnus being more ſenſi-
ble to the preſence of acids than other teſts ; for I have lately
diſcovered a teſt liquor (the preparation of which I mean to ©
publiſh ſoon) which is mo ſenſible to the hs of acids ,

*: You have informed me, that Mr. Cavzxvisn has alſo obſerved-this fat; 2
and that he has mentioned it in a Paper lately read before the Royal Society ; but IG
had obſerved the fact previous to my knowledge of his paper,

Wepiſicated nitre that turns litmus red,

—— unavoidable little accidents which have attended theſe
experiments, and which tend to render their reſults dubious,
have prevented me from relying on them as full proofs of the

Gated air; though they give great probability to the ſuppoſi-
D on, I have, therefore, explained the whole of the hypotheſis
nd experiments with the diffidence which ought to accompany
wvery attempt to account for the phenomena of nature on
Sther principles than thoſe which are commonly received by
iloſophers'in general. And'in purſuance of the fame mo»
Eves it 15 proper to mention, that the alkali employed to fatu-
Eite the phlogiſticated nitrous acid, was always' that of tartar
S hich is partly mild ; and T have not examined whether highly
Bhlogiſticated nitrous acid can perfe&tly' expel: fixedair from an
Jlkah, though 1 know no fat which proves the contrary. Te
thould alſo be” examined, whether the ſame quantity of real
fitrous acid 1s requiſite to ſaturate a given quantity of alkali,
FFhea the acid: is phlogiſticated, as 1s nevelry when it is de-
: logiſticated.

I ſhall be obliged to you to do me the ſame favour in refpe&t to
Fthe preſent letter, if you judge thatit merits it.
