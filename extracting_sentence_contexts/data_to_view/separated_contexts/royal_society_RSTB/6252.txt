The granules are variable in size and
frequently clump together as they leave the cell. The basal epithelial cells do not
possess these granules during shell secretion. In fact, the epithelium as a whole
consists of ciliated cells with an apical nucleus, about which deeply staining granules
are grouped, alternating with basal cells, which appear to be in a state of rest. An interesting example of excessive secretory activity in the apical cells is illustrated
in fig. 34, Plate 21.
