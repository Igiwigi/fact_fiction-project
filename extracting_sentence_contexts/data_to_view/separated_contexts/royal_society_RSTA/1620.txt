We can now enter the setting
of theorem 2.7 and conclude that such result holds for each map Yj. As a next step, we apply theorem 3.8 to the maps ; on the intervals I; , i= 1--- ,n, and find a
p*(A) = u*(r1(A), R1(A)) > 0 such that for each x > *(A) properties (2.12)-(2.15) hold. Gathering
together all the previous facts, we conclude that we can apply theorem 2.13 with m; =m for each
i=1,...,n. The statement about the chaotic dynamics follows by remark 2.15. Our proof is concluded.
