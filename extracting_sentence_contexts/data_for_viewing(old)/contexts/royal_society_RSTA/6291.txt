In the cases of IKP and CZF, it has already been shown that the strategy suggested by theorem
2.12 can be successful. Theorem 6.1 will furnish yet another proof.

Corollary 2.13. IKP and CZF~ have the EP.

Proof. This result is stated as Corollary 6.1 in [12]. There is a sketch of a proof in [12], anticipating
the ordinal analysis of IKP from [28]. More details are provided in the proofs of [28, theorem 2.35
and remark 2.36]. There it is shown that if IKP + 4x C(x) for a X-sentence, then there is a cut-free
proof of it in the infinitary proof system IRS, which can then be milked to extract a term s of IRS
and an ordinal representation @ < Q in B2 (e 241) such that IRSg proves C(8)-*. The entire ordinal
analysis of the infinitary proof can already be formalized in IKP. As a consequence, IKP proves
that there is an ordinal a denoted by @ and a set s denoted by s such that Ly  C(s). This is then
also a fact provable in CZF , and thus, since CZF~ has the numerical EP by the proof of theorem
6.1 in [5] (just ignore the subset collection part), there are concrete such terms @,s (note that terms
of IRSg can be assumed to be coded as naturals), which can be described by Y formulae, say
B,(x) and Bp(x). As a result, we have CZF™ + Ala A!s[Bi(a) A Bo(s) A La ~ C(s)]. The latter being
a Y formula, it is also provable in IKP by theorem 2.9 (i). Hence, IKP has the EP for ¥ formulae.
In the light of theorem 2.12 (i), it follows that IKP and CZF~ have the EP. a

3. Ordinal analyses of Kripke—Platek-like intuitionistic set theories

According to theorem 2.12, one could ascertain the EP for CZFs and CZF p, respectively, if one
succeeded in establishing the EP for ££ formulae for IKP(€) and the EP for ©? formulae for
IKP(P), respectively. The usual techniques for showing the EP (cf. [1], chapter IX), however, do
not work for theories with collection. The ordinal-theoretic proof theory, though, has developed
