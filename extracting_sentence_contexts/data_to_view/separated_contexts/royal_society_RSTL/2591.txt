this ſeem ſtrongly to point out the, common cauſe, the motion
of the ſolar ſyſtem ?

* Tf the light of Caſtor was exactly equal to that of Pollux, and the two tars,
which make up the former ſtar, were perfe&ly of the ſame ſize, we might, on
that account, ſuppoſe the diſtance of Caſtor from us to be to that of Pollux as
M2: 1; but Caſtor is in fat ſomething leſs bright ; and this conſideration, added
70 the former, will make it probable enough that its diſtance may perhaps bs
double that of Pollux, : : j

S lt may be expeCted I ſhould alſo mention ſomething concern-

few diſtant hints. From the annual parallax” of the fixed
tars, which, from my own obſervations, I find much leſs than
:has hitherto been proved to be, we may certainly admit
Ewithout entering into'a"ſubje& which T reſerve for a future
Opportunity) that the diameter of the earth's orbit, at the
Wiſtance of Sirius or Ar&urus, would not nearly ſubtend an
Angle of one ſecond; but the apparent motion of Arfturus, if
wing to a tranſlation of the ſolar ſyſtem, amounts to no leſs

ons of 1/ 11” in right aſcenſion, and 1' 55” in declination,
Into one ſingle motion, and reduce it'to an annual quantity,
