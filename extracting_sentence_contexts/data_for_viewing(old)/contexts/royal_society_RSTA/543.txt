is accounted for by the fact that the largest number of points with the largest values of electron
density falls in that range of time. Taking into account the averaging of the electron density over
the cross section of the microwave beam (focused spot), the calculated value n?"™ agrees well with
the measured data and lies in the interval of absolute electron density values of (2-6) x 10!2 cm-3.

Data on the gas temperature during the initial combustion stage are taken from our
experiments [6], in which a gas temperature in conditions close to isobaric was determined
using a holographic interferometer. At the late stage in the process (at the stage of developed
flame), the gas temperature value was taken from our experiments [7], where it was determined
from the optical spectrum approximated by Planckian intensities of radiation emitted from the
flame region.

Upon varying the mixture composition (methane-oxygen or methane-air), both the maximum
