It is to be observed, that the barks do not keep any respec-
tive proportion in the quantity of gallic acid and tanning prin-
ciple contained in each; which is an evidence of the distinctness
of principle, and may perhaps open a new field for saving oak-
bark in dying, as the willows, sallow, ash, and others, produce
| a very fine black. It is also worthy of observation, that the

quantities of gallic acid and tanning principle do' not differ in
Sl equal proportions, between the winter and spring felled oaks.
© This fact may lead to the discrimination of the proper time for
= cutting ; which is, probably, when the sap has completely filled
= and dilated that part of the vegetable intended for use. This will
D make a difference in the season of cutting oak, elm, and other
RA trees, shrubs, &c. Leaves should be taken when arrived at
S their full size, and then dried under cover; for, as the tanning
Sz principle is s0 soluble, and the substance that contains it 80 thin,
[= (in a leaf,) the dew alone might dissolve it.
S Finally, as the gallic acid does not seem to combine with the
5 matter of skin, and as its astringency will corrugate the surface,
& we may, I think, conclude, that its presence in tanning is not
£ only useless, but detrimental.
