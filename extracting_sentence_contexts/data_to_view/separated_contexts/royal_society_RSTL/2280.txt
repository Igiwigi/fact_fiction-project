IT. 3. Structure of the Cords, Nerves, and Ganglia.

a, It has been admirably proved by Sir CHarLes BELL, in his series of experiments
upon the nervous system in vertebrated animals, detailed in the papers submitted by
him to the Royal Society, that, as regards the physical condition of the being, dif-
ferent parts of the spinal column are endowed with different properties, and minister
to different functions—volition, sensation, and involuntary motion. The same train
of reasoning which led that distinguished philosopher to the discovery of these facts

in the higher animals, must long ago have taught us, That since the laws of nature
are simple and uniform, the same principle exists through the whole series of
animated beings ;—that however altered in arrangement. or appearance in different
parts of the series, structures corresponding to those which are endowed with especial
properties in Man, and his immediate affinities, exist in eyery organized creature
having the powers of locomotion and sensation. Yet however certain this principle
must have appeared to every reflecting mind, we have not until recently been able to
distinguish in invertebrated animals the particular structures from one another, and
to show their analogy with similar structures of the neryous system in the vertebrated.
