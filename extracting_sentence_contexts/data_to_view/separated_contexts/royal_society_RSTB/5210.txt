(b) The Nutrient Veins.—Riess states that the chief nutrient veins of each gill
filament run between the two nutrient arteries deep to the efferent filamentary vessel
from the apex of the filament to its base, and here open into two or three vessels
(supra-ligamentous vessels) that run along the arch between the afferent branchial

vessel and the transverse elastic ligament that unites the articular bases of the
filamentary rays. In the Cod, an injection of the jugular and inferior jugular veins fills a system of
venous factors within the gill arches and filaments. MU.uer and others have already
observed this fact correctly, but are, I venture to think, in error, in regarding the
supra-ligamentous vessels (Plate 84, fig. 4, s.l.v.) as the path by which the blood is
conveyed to the jugular veins from the gills.
