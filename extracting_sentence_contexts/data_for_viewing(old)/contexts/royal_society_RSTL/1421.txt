the animals found at Kirkdale seem to agree in species with
those that occur in' the fissures ;' but as they are at the same
time not distinguishable from existing species, the argument
arising from” this resemblance-is/imperfect. The discovery

For an account” of the bones accumulated/in these fissures,
I must again refer to the works of M. Cuvies, which con-

early tate of habitation'on our” planet, and a more valuable
collection of authentic facts relating to the history of its fossil
animals of the higher orders, than "can be found in all the
books that have ever yet been written on'the subject,

Three analogous 'cases have been noticed in this" country
in cavities of mountain lime-stone, at Burringdon, in' Somerset=
