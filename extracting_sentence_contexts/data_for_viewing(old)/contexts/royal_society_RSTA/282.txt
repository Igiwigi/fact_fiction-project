where |W) is a pure state and e%hw/2nkT, n the number of qubits and T
the equilibrium temperature. The measured NMR signal from such a state is
proportional to the nuclear magnetization,

M* x Tr{o* ly) WI}, (1.4)

therefore behaving as a pure quantum state. (ii) The second point is that RF
pulses implement nearly ideal unitary transformation. By exploiting a fine pulse
control and free evolution with J-coupling, a universal set of quantum logic gates
can be designed. Particularly important are pulse sequences that implement the
QST, for both spin 1/2 and quadrupole nuclei [1].

The two earlier-mentioned facts are the very basis of NMR-QIP, and work
extremely well for two-qubit quantum computers. But as the number of qubits
increases, things rapidly become complicated. One of the main challenges in
current research on NMR-QIP concerns the design of special pulse sequences
and, for that, powerful techniques have been developed: strong modulating pulses
and gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE). In the next paragraphs, we will
briefly describe the contents on various aspects of NMR-QIP discussed in this
Theme Issue.

A general review about recent advances in NMR-QIP, focusing on decoupling,
pulse engineering and indirect nuclear control techniques, is presented by Criger
et al. [2]. Souza et al. [3] present a detailed study of a robust dynamical decoupling,
which is largely immune to pulse imperfections and enables an increase of the
