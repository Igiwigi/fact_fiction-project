Such a general agree-
ment might be expected, for any air coming from the south must have a westward
motion due to the greater velocity of the earth's rotation in a southern parallel. This
anomaly, if real, may be caused by the geographical conditions to which I have already
alluded. To them also may be referred the fact that at May 15% W=0, though
$=2"-41, from which a sensible magnitude of the other might be expected. Tt must,
however, be observed that some of the changes exhibited in this Table can scarcely be
regarded as periodical. I have already pointed out that from the very great dis-
cordance of individual observyations it is evident that a much greater number of them
than is afforded by a period of seven years is required to eliminate the barometric and
hygrometric influences.
