I showed that these muscles
formed a regulatory system controlling the internal body pressure which varies every time
the limbs are cast out. We are now considering the case when the limbs are not being
cast out, but this does not affect the possible activity of this group of muscles. In fact, it
simplifies matters, for they will be unhindered in their activity. They will simply contract
sufficiently to produce a higher pressure in the prosoma, and hence in the blood pumpâ€”
