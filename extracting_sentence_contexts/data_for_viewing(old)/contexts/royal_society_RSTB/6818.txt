immunity, one is apt to argue in a circle. The work of Ainsworth (1935) and Bawden
and Pirie (19374) on the behaviour of cucumber viruses III and IV and tobacco
mosaic shows how viruses which from their serological reactions must be regarded
as related strains, from another point of view, viz. the capacity to infect a common
host and there exhibit cross immunity, are unrelated inasmuch as the cucumber
strain will not infect tobacco, nor the tobacco the cucumber.

ACQUIRED IMMUNITY AND THE CARRIER PROBLEM

In 1932 Salaman (1932) put forward evidence in support of the suggestion that
“carriers” might be created artificially by the co-existence of more than one or two
unrelated viruses within the plant, each of which might be individually pathogenic.
This view would at first sight appear to be contradicted by the fact established inde-
pendently by Murphy and McKay (1931) and Salaman (1932), viz. that two viruses
each of which acting alone was relatively harmless, might when present together
produce a serious disease. In the one, union determines pathogenicity, in the other
neutralization of symptoms, the immediate environment in either case being similar.
As an example of the first class of phenomena may be cited Murphy’s experiment
where the union of the viruses A and X, and here X° may be used, neither of which
acting independently calls forth any but the mildest symptoms in the potato variety
President, yet together produce a serious disease known as “Crinkle A”. Another
example is that described by the writer in which virus Z, derived from paracrinkle, a
