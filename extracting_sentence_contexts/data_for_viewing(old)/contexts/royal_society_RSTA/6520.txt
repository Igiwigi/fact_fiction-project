Compared with §3a, in the case of a vibrating flexural beam, the dynamic reflector leaves an
exponentially decreasing perturbed area behind.

At the same time, the energy flux in the incoming wave is completely reflected. It is clear that
there are no period-averaged energy fluxes between the waveguide and oscillator (since in the
steady-state regime considered, the oscillator average energy is unchanged). This fact is reflected
by the —1/2 phase shift; see equations (3.11) and (3.17). The phase shift in forced oscillations and
associated waves has been recently considered in [15].

4. Discrete—continuous structures subjected to dynamic loading

In the recent paper [15], forced waves were considered in a master body equipped with a dynamic
sub-structure or in contact with an ambient medium.

The non-local integral relations connecting the forces on the one hand and the displacements
on the other may be highly effective for solving problems involving moving loads. Of course, in
this case, the corresponding Green’s kernels are also required.
