The starting point of secondary flow studies is a paper by Fosdick et al. [43], showing that
secondary flows are necessary in general situations for fluids. A parallel effort can be found in
elasticity [44] and in turbulent flows [45]. In fact, secondary motions are more ubiquitous than was
envisaged. The semi-inverse method championed by Rivlin to find analytical solutions to the field
equations of continuum mechanics gives rise to many compatibility problems and opens the door
to many perturbative schemes connected with the appearance of the secondary deformations or
motions. Here, Gomez-Constante & Rajagopal [46] study the flow of a certain type of non-Newtonian
fluids in tubes of elliptic and other non-circular cross-sections.
