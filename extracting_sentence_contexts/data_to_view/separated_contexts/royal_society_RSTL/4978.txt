Assuming that a light effect were obtained, it would then become a question whether the effects were not due
to the changes which occur at the electrodes, rather than at the points of nutrition or secretion. The physical
philosopher has an undoubted right to call upon the physiologist to point out the anion and cation in his cir-
cuit, or some adequate cause for the current. The fact is, the vagueness associated with the term current has
misled physiologists. We are firmly convinced, that, without extreme care, a delicate galvanometer would only
lead to confusion ; there is no difficulty in obtaining an effect upon the needle; if anything, we obtain more
than we want : the great point is to account for it when obtained, 7. e, to show with what class of phenomena
the effects may be referred.

nearly half an inch in diameter and 3 inches in length, was bent thus, U, and con-
tained water; one limb was connected with one of the mercurial cups by a piece of
copper wire of the same thickness as those connected with the galvanometer, and
3 inches in length ; the other limb of the tube was connected with another mercurial
cup by a similar piece of copper wire; each of these wires dipped, to the extent of a
quarter of an inch, into the water.
