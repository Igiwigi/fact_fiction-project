They do not occur again until the 26th ; hence to the 1st of November © Dew :” s8ub-
sequently none until the 1st of December; hence no dew until the 6th of January
1828, when dew was met with on garden land, but not on Feld land; such continued
to be the case during the whole of January. At Marheh, Pergunnah Mohol, garden
produce was covered with a copious dew every morning ; the lands bordering the
gardens for forty or fifty yards around were slightly sprinkled with it ; but there was
not a vestige of it on the fields constituting the rising ground north and south of the
tract, of garden land. I had daily experience of these facts from my habits of quail
shooting. In the young wheats I observed that the quantity of dew on the plants was
in ratio to the proximity of the time at which they had been irrigated. Plants on
land, irrigated the day previously, wetted my shoes and cloth pantaloons thoroughly
in a few minutes.
