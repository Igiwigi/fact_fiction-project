An oil which has thus
been spread is afterwards collected, by some irregularity of
attraction, into thin drops, which the slightest agitation again
dissipates : their surface forms a very regular curve, which
terminates abruptly in a surface perfectly horizontal : now it
follows from the laws of hydrostatics, that the lower surface
of these drops must constitute a curve, of which the extreme
inclination to the horizon is to the inclination of the upper
surface as the specific gravity of the oil to the difference be-
tween its specific gravity and that of water: consequently
since the contractile forces are held in equilibrium by a force
which is perfectly horizontal, their magnitude must be in the
ratio that has been already assigned ; and it may be assumed
as consonant both to theory and to observation, that the con-
tractile force of the common surface of two substances, is
proportional, other things being equal, to the difference of
their densities. Hence, in order to explain the experiments
of BoyLE on the effects of a combination of fluids in capillary
tubes, or any other experiments of a similar nature, we have
only to apply the law of an equable tension, of which the
magnitude is determined by the difference of the attractive
powers of the fluids. ;

I shall reserve some further illustrations of this subject for
a work which I have long been preparing for the press, and
which I flatter myself will contain a clear and simple expla-
nation of the most important parts of natural philosophy. I

have only thought it right, in the present Paper, to lay before
the Royal Society, in the shortest possible compass, the parti-
culars of an original investigation, tending to explain some
facts and establish some analogies, which have hitherto been
obscure and unintelligible.
