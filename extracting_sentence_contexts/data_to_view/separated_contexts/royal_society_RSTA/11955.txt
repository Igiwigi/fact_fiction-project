Undoubtedly the
iridium was volatilized, for it lost weight to the extent of 0Â°0826 grm., and the end
was worn away by the flame impinging upon it. The spectrum was very weak, the
lines were not those referred to above, and it is suspected that some of them at least
are due to a gaseous spectrum, or possibly to a series of the lines belonging to the
spectrum attributed to water vapour which have not previously been observed. The fact that iridium is slightly volatile has undoubtedly been proved, but if the
metal is pure it may be used advantageously for the purpose of supporting irreducible
oxides in the oxy-hydrogen blow-pipe flame. ALUMINIUM. When the metal, in the form of foil, is burnt in the oxy-hydrogen blow-pipe, it
gives a spectrum which is continuous, but in which some few lines or narrow bands
are visible.
