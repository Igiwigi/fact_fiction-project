of one animal (O.M. 81) and for 15 days in the case of the other two (O.M. 65 and
O.M. 66). The dimensions of the hydatids are given in Table IV. Those removed from
O.M. 66 are relatively enormous, but on the available data this fact must be regarded
as an individual anomaly, and in the main not an effect of the injections. The other
hydatids are slightly larger than normal (Table III), but whether the slight difference
is significant is doubtful.


THE HYDATIDS OF MORGAGNI 163

Histologically the hydatids appear to be little, if at all, different from the normal.
Those recovered from O.M. 65 and from O.M. 81, the animal which had received
most of the hormone, show no definite distinguishing characteristics. Those of O.M. 66
contain large central ducts, and the epithelium of the right duct, which opens into the
sac of the tunica vaginalis, is extensively folded. A few mitotic figures were seen in the
