point, the map becomes the territory, and the idiosyncratic
quirks of letter and colour that, to the synaesthete, are a
valued and cherished part of their perception of the world
become indecipherably complex to the scientist attempting to
understand them. However, imposing limitations on the com-
plexity of the experience in order to obtain data that researchers
can meaningfully analyse assumes from the start that finding a
simple, parsimonious explanation is the ideal result, instead of
understanding the experience itself. Here I advocate taking a
step back to understand and describe what synaesthetes do
in fact typically experience first, and to attempt to identify pat-
