Thus this investigation shows that extraneous forces may influence the proportion
of the sexes produced, and it is clear that the hereditary tendency of any race or
species to produce the sexes in certain proportion may be radically interfered with by
a great variety of circumstances. In dealing with human beings living under civilised conditions, such interference
can only be comparatively slight, and the comparatively small differences recorded
under some headings of this paper may be judged by some to be inconclusive. — I
think, however, it cannot be denied that the main points of difference I have set forth
are so consistently exhibited for both the white and coloured races in Cuba, and the
variations in the proportion of the sexes produced are so intimately associated with
factors which undoubtedly affect the metabolic activity of the women, that they must
be accepted as valid evidence of the fact that physical, and especially nutritive,
conditions do affect the ratio of the sexes of offspring, and may override the
hereditary tendency of the race in this respect. But if this be true for women it must also be true for all animals in which the
ripening of the ovarian ova is subject to selective action. There is some evidence,
