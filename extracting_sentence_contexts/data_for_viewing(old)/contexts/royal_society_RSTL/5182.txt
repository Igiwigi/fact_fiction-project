THOSE who have consulted the records of the Society for purposes of history,
have omitted to find, or at least to notice, an addition made to the Committee ap-
pointed to decide between KeiL and Le1Bnizz, between the commencement of its
labours and the presentation of its report. Singularly enough this omission makes
Nzewrox appear to assert a positive falsehood, in a matter of which he must have
had accurate knowledge, and as to which the position of President gave him every
opportunity of refresbing his memory.

The real facts are, that on the 6th of March 1711-12, a Committee was appointed
to inspect the Archives, consisting of ArBuTHNoT, Hill, Haitey, Joxnss, Machin,
and BurNeT: and that further, Roparrts, a contributor to the Transactions, was
added on the 20th, Boxer, the Prussian minister, on the 27th, and Dz Moivse,
AsTox, and Brook 'TayLor on the 17th of April. Of these newly-added members,
Boxer and Ds Morvss were aliens. All the historical writers who enumerate the
Members of the Committee, say nothing about the additions, but confine their list to
the six gentlemen first named, that is, to the original Committee.

Now Newrox, in his letter to CoxTr of February 26, 1715-16, first published at
the end of the English edition of Raeason's History of Fluxions, asserts that the
materials of the Commercium £Epistolicum were © collected and published by a numerous
Committee of gentlemen of different nations, appointed by the Royal Society for that
