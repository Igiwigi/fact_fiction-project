Early estimates often
simply estimated CFR by using the number of deaths divided
by the number of cases reported to date [15,16]. These esti-
mates did not consider the fact that in a growing outbrea
a significant proportion of reported cases may yet die, or
the fact that the clinical outcome is only reported in a fraction
of cases, therefore under-estimating the true CFR [17,18]. While estimates of the CFR stemming from analysis of the
whole outbreak have been in line with those reported from
previous outbreaks, typically around 60-70% [11,12,19],
CER estimates from smaller studies have been more variable
and often considerably lower [4—10,13], owing to the fact that
the study populations were not representative of the overall
characteristics of reported cases, for instance often focusing
on hospitalized cases only. Understanding factors influencing mortality is important
to not only understand the severity of a pathogen and factors
associated with differences in mortality, but also to improve
patient care. For example, the evaluation of the efficacy
of treatment regimens or new drugs relies on accurate
baseline CFR estimates, and study design of randomized con-
trolled trials can be adapted to take into account important
determinants of patient outcomes [7].
