the displacement annulled in the second. With the long e links stretching from
S (3) to 28968 we get the enlarged values which seem frequently to be associated with
the chief lines.

From 28968 two chains diverge, one through 31429 ultimately leading to D(5)
through 30393. There are no clear indications to show where the false link occurs.
The first link w = 246112 is so large that at first sight it might seem to be spurious ;
but it falls in well with the others as may be seen from the formula list. It would
look as if the series of long links should be 3773°59, 3778°77, 3778°77, z.e., uw(—8),
u(—38), u(—38), but that the last for some reason took ~ (—2é) at first but completed
the extra (—é) in the next link. The formule in this chain, as will be seen, involve
very few displaced links beyond those it started with, due to the above indubitably
enlarged e links. In fact such only enter in No, 21 and in 25, 26, which latter form
part of a mesh. On the other hand, as will be seen below, the formule based on
D(5) show very good links up to 29514 and even beyond. Provisionally I have
placed the spurious link as that between 29514 and 30394 with a = 878°72 in place
of 880°77.

Returning to 28968 and considering the other branch chain from it, the second link
918°65 is small, but is naturally accounted for by the long e—which entered as due to
3779 after 8,(3)—changing to the same value as the second e link 3776 which
entered immediately after it. The links 2455°51 and — 2461°79 appear at first sight
too abnormal, they are exactly explained by a return of the two long links after
§,(3), which became equal in No. 27 to the value of that before S,(3). From
30806 starts the false cycle referred to above. In order to keep the map as open
