to lay most stress upon the first one; for he merely mentions the 8econd method in a
short footnote towards the end of his paper, and there states that he only tried it, in
a few cases. Yet to me it seems that for the object in view the second method is much
more trustworthy than the first. I am well aware of the fact, pointed out, by Dr.
Eres, that upon each contraction of a given segment of Aurelia aurita the two arms
of the 80-called © contractile zone” approximate each other, and that this gives rise
to the appearance of spontaneous action on their part. TI think, however, that this
appearance is deceptive, being caused only by the absence of resistance at the inter-
rupted part of the margin to the pressure exerted by the contraction of the immediately
surrounding tissues. At any rate, 80 long as this possible explanation has not been
thoroughly excluded by experiments conducted on the converse method of removing
the lithocysts from between the arms of the contractile zone, s0 long, it seems to me,
must the method we are considering be valueless, The question, then, must be decided
by the converse method just alluded to, and by it alone. Now I have made experiments
according to this method, and, 80 far as I remember, in every case, when sufficient care
was taken to remove all the lithocysts, the contractile zone entirely ceased its contrac-
