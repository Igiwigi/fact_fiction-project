the vascular bundles in the petiole and rachis. This fact holds good for both genera,
Both in structure and form, then, the leaves of Lyginodendron and Heterangium ave
Fern-leaves, their one point of difference being the occurrence of pitted as distinguished
from scalariform tracheides in their xylem.

Now, as regards Lyginodendron, the distinctively Fern-like character is limited to
the foliage; this, however, is not the case with the other genus. Apart from the â€”
secondary growth, the stem of Heterangium is essentially that of a monostelic Fern
of the Gleichenia type. The resemblance of the stele of Heterangiwm to that of a
Gleichenia is, in fact, very marked, as regards the distribution of the tracheides and
conjunctive parenchyma, the position of the protoxylem-groups, and the presence of
a wide pericycle. We think the comparison with Gleichenia may prove to be a fertile
one, and hope to pursue it further on another occasion. It is not at all unlikely that
the Gleichenia type of structure may be of great antiquity. We see, then, that if we
left the secondary thickening out of account, there would be no serious reason
against regarding Heterangium as a fairly typical monostelic Fern. We notice,
however, certain peculiarities :

1. The presence of pitted tracheides.

2. The collateral structure of the bundles passing from the stele to the leaves.
