In some cases, the thoughts and corresponding actions are causally yoked (e.g.
making tea). In others, they are constrained by linguistic rules and communica-
tive norms (e.g. text versus spoken messages). Still others are governed by
cultural conventions as well as idiosyncratic considerations (e.g. birthday cele-
brations) that are causally opaque and ‘goal demoted’ (ie. it is difficult for an
observer to discern the objective [1-3]). Ritual sequences include these last
