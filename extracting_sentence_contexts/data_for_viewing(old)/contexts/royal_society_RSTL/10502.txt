brilliancy with which an imponderable trace of sodium in a mineral declares its
presence in the spectrum, I venture to think that a chemist would have about as stiff
a hunt before he caught his yellow line as I had to bring my orange and citron bands
to earth.*

Chemistry, except in few instances, as water-analysis and the detection of poisons,
where necessity has stinmlated minute research, takes little account of © traces ;” and
when an analysis adds up to 99:99, the odd 0-01 per cent. is conveniently put down to
©* impurities,” * loss,” or © errors of analysis.” When, however, the 99:99 per cent.
constitutes the impurity and this exiguous 0'01 is the precious material to be extracted,
and when, moreover, its chemistry is absolutely unknown, the difficulties of the
problem become enormously enhanced. Tnsolubility as ordinarily understood is a
fiction, and separation by precipitants is nearly impossible. A new chemistry has to
be slowly built up, taking for data uncertain and deceptive indications, marred by the |
interfering power of mass in withdrawing eoluble salts from a solution, and the
slubility of nearly all precipitates in water or in ammoniacal salts when present in
traces only, What is here meant by © traces ” will be better understood if I give an |
instance. After 8ix months work I obtained the carth didymia in a state which mosb ©
chemists would call absolutely pure, for it contained not more than one part of _

*80 recently as the year 1880 a high authority on blowpipe chemistry seriously argued that the yolloW
coloured flame © which is ascribed to sodium ” is not caused by that metal, but is due to © obemical
water.” (* Chemical News,” vol. xli., p. 159, April 2, 1880.)
