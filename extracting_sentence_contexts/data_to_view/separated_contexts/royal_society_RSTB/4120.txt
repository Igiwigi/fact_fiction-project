M. WOODCOCK: OBSERVATIONS ON COPROZOIC FLAGELLATES,

in the rumen, ever occur in an active condition in dung-cultures ; and, on the other
hand, I have never found any of the coprozoic flagellates active in the rumen-
contents, when freshly examined. These facts, readily determined because the sets
of forms in the two cases are entirely different, afford important confirmation of the
view, now generally accepted, that the Hntameba—the truly parasitic forms—are

quite distinct from the Amabe which develop in fecal cultures, i.e., coprozoic species,
The Coprozoie Fauna,—The coprozoic protozoa occurring in goat- and sheep-dung
are mainly flagellates. Ciliates are extremely rare : I have observed their presence
(Colpoda sp., a holotrichous form) only on four or five occasions in all my numerous
original cultures, over a period of more than two years, even when the cultures have
been kept for several weeks. On the other hand, in simple infusions made of the hay
which is the chief fodder of the goats and sheep under examination, ciliates (Colpoda,
Paramecium and another form, Loxodes?) soon begin to appear and become, one
after another, abundant...
