Thus, depending on which failure mode is being analysed, e.g. a fibre failure mode
in a UD composite, the choice of the microstructural region will be accordingly. In each case,
the microstructural region must also include the appropriate manufacturing defects (e.g. fibre
misalignment) within the region. This region, often called the representative volume element
(RVE), is denoted here as real initial material state (RIMS) to capture the fact that it represents
the ‘real’ material state as produced at the end of the manufacturing process, i.e. ‘initially’, when
the composite is placed in the service environment. The realization of RIMS is labelled as RVE-1
and RVE-2 at the lamina and the laminate levels, respectively. The stress and failure analysis of
the appropriate RVE will generate the conditions (criteria) for the particular failure mode.
