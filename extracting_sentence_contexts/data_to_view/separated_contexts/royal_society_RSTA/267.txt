The authors also stress that there are ‘additional
complications of randomness inherent in wind engineering (be it buffeting by incident turbulence
or spanwise decorrelation of vortices’s shed) and the inter- and intra-personal variability inherent
in human walking’. Amabili’s paper [78] notes that ‘reduced-order models are essential to study
nonlinear vibrations of structures and structural components. In fact, large models with many
thousands or more degrees of freedom obtained by commercial finite-element codes cannot
be used to obtain all the branches of the forced vibration response around a resonance of the
structure. This limitation is mainly due to the huge computational problem involved and to the
fact that stiff systems of equations are obtained due to the very different time scales associated
with different degrees of freedom’. The author offers suggestions for selection of the modes to
facilitate reduction of the number of degrees of freedom.
