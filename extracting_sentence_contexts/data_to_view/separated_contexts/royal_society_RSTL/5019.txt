On trying different coloured glasses, which were placed, first in front of
S the fluid, and then in front of the eye, it was found that the blue beam, as had
= previously proved to be the case with the narrow band, was for the most part dif-
5 ferently affected according as the glass was placed s0 as to intercept the incident or
2 the dispersed light. Moreover, the long blue beam and the narrow band did not
behave in the same manner under the action of the same coloured glass.

of refrangibility. Admitting that the effect of a coloured glass is simply to stop a
certain fraction of the incident light, that fraction being a function of the refrangi-
bility, it is plain thar the results can be explained in no other way. It must be
confessed however that these results are merely an extension of that which precisely
constitutes the peculiarity of the phenomenon.
