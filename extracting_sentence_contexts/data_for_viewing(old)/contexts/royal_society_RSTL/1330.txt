Jical arteries are branches of the general arterial system, and
only a portion of the blood of the child is sent to the placenta,
whereas in the foetus which I have described, the trunk of the
vena cava was continued into the vein of the chord, and the
whole of the venous blood circulated through the placenta,
and was exposed to the influence of the arterial blood of the
mother,

But the most interesting circumstance, which we learn from
this examination is, that the circulation not only can be car-
ried on without a heart, but that a child- so circumstanced can
be maintained in its growth, so as to attain the same size as
a foetus which is possessed of that organ. This fact is con-
trary to what prior experience has. led us to expect, as will
appear from the following abstract of the authenticated cases
of this species of malformation, which we find on record.

A monster, in which there was no heart, is described by
M. Mzry.* There were twins, one of which was well formed,
and of the usual size of a six month's child : the size of the
other was not mentioned, s0 that no comparison could be
made between them. In the latter, the head, neck, and upper
extremities were wanting. There were no vestiges of a brain,
nor was there any liver. The dissection of the blood-vessels
does not appear to have been very accurately made, but from
