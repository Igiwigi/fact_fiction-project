Much of our knowledge about how tropical forests
respond to drought is derived from studies in plots specifi-
cally chosen for their lack of disturbance. Since at least half
of extant tropical forests are managed or disturbed [61], it is
equally important to understand the response of these
‘degraded’ forests.

Our results support the view that tall trees are particularly
vulnerable to drought in undisturbed forests. However,
after a certain proportion of large trees die due to drought,
and if logging approximates that process of drought-culling
of large trees, then the remnant large trees may no longer
be particularly vulnerable. In fact, their size, and stem
diameter, in particular, may serve to buffer them against
future droughts.

If our finding that, in logged forests, drought-induced mor-
tality does not depend on tree height holds across the tropics,
then instead of a limit on tree size as previously suggested, we
may see an initial reduction in the density of large trees in
drought-stressed but unlogged areas, which could then level
off to lower densities in a more drought-affected world.

Recent studies (e.g. [3]) suggest that forests will experi-
ence ever increasing drought-induced mortality rates as a
