of cotton to the tip of the abdomen’ (Fraenkel 1939; confirmed ‘to a certain extent’
by Braun 1939).

NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS

Methods

The most direct and unequivocal method of studying the physiology of a sense organ
is to record impulses in the nerve supplying it. In the case of the haltere the technical
difficulties of applying this method are considerable owing to the small size of the flies
available in this country and the fact that the organ does not function at all unless it is
oscillating. When the fly has been dissected sufficiently to allow the haltere nerve to be
picked up on electrodes, the haltere muscle is usually found to be inexcitable.

To overcome this difficulty several different methods were tried of causing the haltere
to oscillate artificially. These included attaching a small iron filing to the end-knob and

moving it in an alternating electromagnetic field, touching the cuticle near the hinge with
the point of a vibrating needle, and the application of an intermittent tension to the cut
peripheral end of the haltere muscle. Although a large discharge of impulses in the nerve
