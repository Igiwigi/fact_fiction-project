The pixel classification produced by COS applied to the raw hypercube is shown in figure 5a,
where we reversed the pixel classification values. We needed to do so in order to have meaningful
results. In fact the corresponding ROC curve, plotted in dashed black in figure 62, would be
below the random guess curve without the reversion. If we apply the PostP method to the
reversed COS classification, we can improve the classification performance. This is verified by
the increase in the area under the ROC curve (plotted in solid black in figure 6a).
