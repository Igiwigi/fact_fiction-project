1, inter-limb space 10-11. This will open up
the whole of the inter-limb space and suction will be general throughout its length during
the short interval until the anterior of the two limbs also commences its backstroke. It is this fact of maximum suction towards the bases of the limbs during the greater
part of their forward stroke that is responsible for the marked movement of water
between the two rows of limbs in a vertical direction towards the mid-ventral groove—
Navumann’s “‘vertikale Transportstréme.” There would, of course, be a movement
of this type if the limbs swung forwards parallel to each other and suction were con-
sequently uniform throughout their length. The maximum suction at the base of the
limbs simply enhances this water movement.
