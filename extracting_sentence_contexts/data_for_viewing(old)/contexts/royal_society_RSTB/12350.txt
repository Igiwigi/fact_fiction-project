conditions across the world [1,2]. These perturbations include the removal of
most terrestrial megafaunal diversity and over-exploitation of fisheries; the con-
version of more than a third of the world’s terrestrial ecosystems for agriculture,
livestock (replacement megafauna) grazing and human dwellings; doubling
global nitrogen fixation and the release of a wide array of novel chemicals
into the environment; and the transfer of species around the planet at an unpre-
cedented rate. Other rapid perturbations also include the release of greenhouse
gasses, especially COz, resulting in altered photosynthetic rates for plants,
climate change and ocean acidification. Both the high speed of change (e.g.
rate of atmospheric CO, increase) and the destination (e.g. potential future
CO, concentrations not seen for 20 million years) are important to biotic
responses, as well as the fact that multiple pressures are acting together [3-6].
The global extent of these changes means that essentially every location on
the Earth has already been influenced by human activity, save for an unknown
proportion of microbial communities within geological substrates. The result
has been the decline and extermination of some genes, populations and species,
a loss which has been characterized as ‘the biodiversity crisis’. However, the
new anthropogenic conditions simultaneously favour other genes, populations
and species, increases of which can be thought of as biological gains. These
gains, as well as losses, are so extensive that it is no longer possible to disentan-
gle human and non-human contributions to gene frequencies, geographical
distributions, the composition of biological communities or ecosystem functions
[7,8]. Humans and human-related activities are integral to the biological
processes of the Earth system, arising from the unlikely evolution and then
