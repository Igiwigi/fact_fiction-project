the key research challenges for stability analysis of future power systems can be grouped into
three broad areas:

(i) Efficient use of and reliance on existing and newly acquired data through deployed local
measurement devices and two-way communications-enabled meters and global wide-
area monitoring systems (WAMS) for state estimation, static and dynamic equivalents
and control (including real-time control). This implies efficient data management (signal
processing, aggregation and transmission), reliability of, and reliance on, ICT networks,
as they are essential for both static and dynamic observability of the system.

(ii) Modelling for steady-state and dynamic studies of

— Large interconnected networks with generation mix, FACTS devices and short- and
long-distance bulk power transfers using HVDC lines.

— Clusters of RESs (generation and storage) of the same or different type.

— Parts of, or the whole, LV and MV distribution network with thousands of integrated
RESs.

— Demand, including new types of energy-efficient and PE-controlled loads, heat
pumps, customer participation and behavioural patterns, EV, etc.

— Centralized and distributed storage technologies (i.e. virtual storage plant) for
provision of ancillary services.
