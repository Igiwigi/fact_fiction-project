Q The experiments of Mr. GoLDISGHAM at Madras, on the retardation of sound in moist
Air, and the theoretical researches of Mr. Earxsnaw, both, by analogy, rendered & priori
Sprobable the fact itself, now for the first time, s0 far as I am aware, experimentally
Shown.
® It follows, then, on reference to my former experiments at Killiney Bay, that the rate
Sf wavye-propagation in highly stratified, contorted and foliated rock is intermediate
:Setween that for dense wet sand and for discontinuous and shattered granite. Adopt-
Sng the firs} mean from the 8maller charges of powder, as better comparable with the
illiney experiments, which were made with charges of only 25 lbs. of powder, and
Svyhich would doubtless have given higher velocities with heavier charges, we obtain the
