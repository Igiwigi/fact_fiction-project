The output of spores per
sporangium in 7. Tunbridgense compares favourably with that in Ferns which have
a simultaneous sorus, and even the single sporangium of H. dilatatwin produces as
many as those of most of the Schizswacese. These facts are of the more importance
since the Hymenophyllacez are the only other Leptosporangiate Ferns whose sporangia
have been found to produce numbers of spores comparable to those which rule in the
Gleicheniacese, Osmundaceze, and Schizzeaceze. With the exception of Trichomanes reniforme, which is certainly an unusual type
of the genus in having a more massive structure of the lamina,* all the species of
Trichomanes which have been examined show low numbers; and this I take to be
a result of reduction from a larger type, similar in nature to that seen in Todea,
though carried further. We have noted above (p. 41) that the “filmy” Zodeas
have a smaller output per sporangium than 7.
