It must therefore be concluded that part of the carbonic acid exhaled from vegetable
tissues arises from a source independent of oxidation. It must therefore be due to a
separation of the gas from one or several of the proximate constituents of their tissues
in consequence of the chemical changes therein taking place.

"This is a view that is by no means novel. RocnLeper®* and others have already
advanced it as an hypothesis. Indeed the former appears inclined to attribute the evo-
lution of carbonic acid to this cause, even in s8ome cases where it is ordinarily regarded
as a direct product of the s0-called plant respiration. Moreover there are several facts
in the known chemistry of plant-growth which harmonize with this view. It is easily
een that the subtraction of the elements of carbonic acid from any vegetable principle
will have the result of leaving a residue richer in both carbon and hydrogen, and hence
of higher force-yalue.

There are grounds for believing that woody tissue is derived from the starch secreted
under the influence of sunlight in the leaves of the plant. But as these tissues contain
a larger percentage of carbon, and have a higher force-value than starch, this change
would be effected by the separation of a substance having a less force-value, as is the
case with carbonic acid, in which the energy of combination is nearly exhausted. (A
decompoxition of this nature occurs in the slow changes by which wood is converted into
lignite and coal.) The conversion of starch into fats in plants is a change which
