But it was known &@ priori (I will presently show how this is 80) that the sum of the
resulting coefficients should be equal to zero, and that they are 0 in fact is a verification
as to all the coefficients. - The foregoing specimen term BCDE is one which remains
unaltered when B, C, D, E are changed into E, D, C, B; and on making the further change
a,b,c,dq,e,fintof,e, d,c, b, a, the coefficient of BODE remains, as it should do, unaltered ;
this is a verification of the coefficients of the terms ace*, df; ad*e, bf, which are
respectively interchanged by the substitution in question, but not of the other terms
wf*, abef, acdf, b*@, bedf, which are respectively unaltered by the substitution. I did not
employ what would haye been another convenient verification of the several divisions,

viz. the comparison of their values on putting therein a=b=e=d=e=f=1, with the
corresponding values as calculated independently from the determinant
y4—B—4C—6D—E, — B—5C—10D—10E, — C— 5D—10E,
E, y— B—-4C— 6DP+ E, — B— 5C—10D ,
DE 5D+ E, y— B— 40+ 4D+ EB,
Cc : 5C+ D 4 10C+ 5D+ E,
B : 5B+ C s 10B+ 5C+ D 5
D—5E, —E
— C-5D 5 — D
— B=— 5C > — C0

4— B+ 6C+4D+ EB, — B
10B+100+5D+ E, y+4B+6C+4D+E

The calculation of the ten divisions of this determinant would however itself haye been a
work of some labour. The last-mentioned determinant is =y*; in fact, equating it to zero, we have the
transformed equation corresponding to the system of equations

(151;4; 1:35 Lew, S090;
4=(7+1)B+(a*+5x+4)C+(2*+54*+107+6)D+(4*+54a%+104a*+107+4)E. But the first of these equations is (x+1)*=0, and the second is
y=(a+1)(B+(a+4)C+(a*+4x+6)D+(a%+42%+62+4)E},

£0 that for each of the five equal roots z=—1, we have y=0, or the transformed
equation in y is y*=0. MR.
