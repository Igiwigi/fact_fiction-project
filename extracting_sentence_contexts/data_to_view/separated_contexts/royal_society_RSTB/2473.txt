other animals of that which in ourselves is regarded as a congenital defect, is a
diminished transparency of the nerve fibre layer as it radiates from the disc. A slight

degree of opacity is met with in the Negroes and all dark-haired races, and in a

particularly in the Leporidze and in some of the Marsupials, such, for instance, as the
Perameles lagotis, in which the fibres are actually opaque and not merely semi-
transparent.
