but in which, as in figs. 128, 124, and 125, the newly-forming blastomere is still in
communication with the yolk (fig. 126); in others a nucleus with a large or small
quantity of protoplasm (merocyte) is found in the yolk near the edge of the blastoderm.

Such nuclei are never found beneath the cells at the anterior pole of the embryo,
which are already cut off from the yolk,

These facts, together with those relating to the division of emerging merocytes,

given on pages 139 and 143, indicate that as the blastoderm grows over the un-
nucleated yolk, the merocytes, before or during emergence, at its edge give off in
turn nuclei into, and become successively cut off from, the yolk. Once cut off they
have no further connection with the yolk, which simply acts as an appendage and
reservoir to the newly forming and growing cell or cells. The nucleus, at first
usually small, is generally in connection with little protoplasm, but soon transforms j
the surrounding yolk granules and oil globules into granular protoplasm with which
it clothes itself, and in this way forms a merocyte ; this, at first in close proximity to” }
the blastomere from which it has been formed, often becomes isolated in the yolk
and forms a rounded protoplasmic nucleated body, with rays extending into the yolk
in which it moves, and the yolk granules of which it probably devours, more or less
