other words, the damping produces a fractalization of the amplitude basins, which implies a
higher unpredictability for the system, showing only two possible states, interwell oscillations or
no oscillations at all. We refer to this phenomenon as damping-induced fractalization.

3. Restoring the interwell high-amplitude oscillation with a minimum value of
the forcing parameter F

In this section, we address the following question: is it possible to restore the high-amplitude
oscillations suppressed by the damping effect? The previous section showed how the damping
in our system (equation (2.1) with F =0) reduces the high-amplitude oscillations of Region IV
(yellow in figure 4) making the trajectories fall into the fixed point (dark blue in figure 4). This
change may be undesired, particularly because a small variation in the time delay may cause a
dramatic change in the dynamics. In fact, in the amplitude basins the yellow and blue basins are
intermingled due to the damping-induced fractalization of the parameter space.

The phenomenon of delay-induced resonance studied in [16] for the overdamped case implies
that even for the parameter values for which the time delay does not induce sustained oscillations
a resonance may appear following a different mechanism. Our scenario is different, as the
underdamped oscillator presents oscillations and the damping term, for certain values, eliminates
these oscillations. However, we show that, even in this case, the delay-induced resonance
phenomenon appears and as a consequence a small forcing is a valid mechanism to gain back
the oscillations and reduce the fractality caused by the damping.

In the following subsections, we explore the parameter values for which a small periodic
forcing can restore the high-amplitude oscillations. To achieve our goal, we start analysing, in
