that such modifications are not restricted to insect eggs alone, but also occur in
other Arthropods and in various other animal groups, viz., fishes (Teleostians and
Selachians), Cyclostomes, Tunicates, and Cephalopods. Phylogenetically, biphased
gastrulation is a secondary feature brought about by the large amount of yolk. The
process of intravitelline separation of yolk cells, on the other hand, is primary. Its
absence is secondary, so that the non-existence of the first gastrulation phase in a few
insects should be regarded as a secondary modification.

b. A New Theory of Multi-phased Gastrulation Among Insects—The theory to be discussed
is essentially a development of the newer biphased gastrulation theory and has been
necessitated by certain facts recently discovered by myself and other authors. It
also attempts, in part, to combine the already described older and newer biphased
gastrulation theories. From both of these, however, it differs in the fact that insect
gastrulation is no longer to be regarded as a process occurring in only two main
periods of activity but in several. This, it need hardly be pointed out, has been
brought about by the large amount of yolk present in insect eggs. The whole
process of gastrulation has been extremely elongated in time and the time relations
of the various phases of the process are profoundly modified. The main theme of
this theory will be developed below with reference to what occurs in Locusta migratoria
and then compared with other insects. Gastrulation in Locusta migratoria occurs,
according to this view, in the following stages :—

First Phase—Cleavage. Intravitelline separation. (This phase of gastrulation
occurs by modified epiboly and results in the differentiation of the primary endo-
derm represented partly by the primary yolk cells.)
