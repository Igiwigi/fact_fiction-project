Instead of the heart-like regularity with which
systole and diastole follow one another in the unpoisoned animal, we now have periods
of violent and prolonged systole resembling tonic spasm ; and when the severity of this
spasm is for a moment abated, it is generally renewed before the gonocalyx has had
time again to become fully expanded. Moreover the spasm itself is not of uniform
intensity throughout the time it lasts ; but while the gonocalyx is in a continuously
contracted state, there are observable a perpetual snccession of extremely irregular
oscillations in the strength of the contractile influence. It is further a highly interest-
ing fact that the convulsions are yery plainly of a paroxysmal nature. Afï¬€ter the gono-
calyx has suffered a prolonged period of conyulsive movements, it expands to its full
dimensions, and in this form remains for some time in a state of absolute quiescence. Presently, however, another paroxysm supervenes, to be followed by another period of
quiescence, and 80 on for hours.
