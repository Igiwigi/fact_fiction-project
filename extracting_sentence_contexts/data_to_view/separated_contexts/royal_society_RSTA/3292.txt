For in Concept I.
geometry has only to do with points, punctual lines, and punctual planes; but in
Concept V. geometry has, in addition, to consider the relation of the objective reals
(which are all “linear”) and of interpoints to the above entities. In this respect,
geometry in Concept V. merges into physics more than does geometry in Concept I. Thus the excess of the number of axioms in Concept V. over the number in
Concept I. arises from the fact that there is a larger field to be covered. Also,
T Hp R is not required in the geometrical reasoning. *25.
