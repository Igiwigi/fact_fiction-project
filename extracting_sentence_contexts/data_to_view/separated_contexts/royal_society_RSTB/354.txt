In fact, in the case of the
22nd generation, the whole of the ammonia had been almost quantitatively converted
into nitrous nitrogen. That in the case of “ Bottle No. 1 (2nd generation),” the sum of the ammoniacal
and nitrous nitrogen is in slight excess of the ammoniacal nitrogen present in ihe
original solution employed is probably due to the bottle in which this 2nd generation
had undergone nitrification having been considerably larger than the others, and
consequently more concentration by evaporation through the cotton-wool stopper
must doubtless have taken place. In order to put this point to the test, we, later on (February 15, 1890), again took
a similar large bottle, in fact, a duplicate of No. 1 above, and found
