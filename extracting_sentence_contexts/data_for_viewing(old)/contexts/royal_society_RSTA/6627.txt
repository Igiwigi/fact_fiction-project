evidently is that, if the axial spike be removed altogether, as shown in fig. 5, the
actual resistance and moment of inertia would not be so much as 1 per cent. different
from the value (4) already found, and that, as these calculations are merely a guide to
direct the design of a practical instrument, an assumption which is not more than 1 or
2 per cent. in error in what is after all a small fraction of the total resistance and
moment of inertia—one which, in fact, is so true that neither the power of the
instrument maker nor our knowledge of the constants will prevent our introducing in
practice variations of far greater magnitude—may be allowed to pass, especially as
without something equivalent it would be impossible to find expressions which would
apply to the more complicated conditions which will be considered later.

The same considerations apply exactly to the sensitive plate, which, when the
greatest efficacy with respect to moment of inertia is required, should no longer be
made prismatic, but should become more narrow towards the ends, as shown in fig. 1.
I may mention that in the original instrument, which I made before I had arrived at
any of these results, I did, as a matter of fact, make the active bar of the shape
