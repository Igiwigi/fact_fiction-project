imminent transition into folds. This can be attributed to the fact that the critical film strain for
period-doubling increases linearly with substrate prestretch [31]. Thus, for high prestretches,
we again observe periodic wrinkling rather than period-doubling. Although varying prestretch
highly controls secondary wrinkling patterns, we will first focus on the influence of prestretch
on the evolution of primary wrinkling and exclusively analyse corresponding data. An elaborate
discussion on secondary modes is the subject of ยง5c.

Figure 7 plots the normalized amplitude A/A of wrinkles versus # = L/I. As primary wrinkles
exhibit an approximately sinusoidal morphology, the evolution of the surface pattern with # is
fully characterized by the evolution of the ratio A/4. We gradually increased the prestretch in
the substrate //Lo, which gradually increased the compression in the film when the substrate is
relaxed (figure 2c). The corresponding film stretches were 3 = 0.85, 3 =0.75, 3 =0.68, 3 =0.67,
0 =0.65 and # = 0.64. With increasing compression, the amplitude of the wrinkles increases,
