Finally, the telson grows backwards above the anus
and the uropods enlarge. Thus the segmentation of Nebalia and Hemimysis is directly

â€œe

comparable, Hemimysis showing a greater concentration of the posterior parts. The
main difference lies in the fact that in Nebalia the caudal furea is large, while in Hemimysis
the uropods are large and the caudal furca embryonic, the telson forming a median out-
growth. However, it is not yet clear whether the caudal furca of Hemimysis embryo is
the same as that of the adult Nebalia. Ciaus (1872) first suggested that the last two segments and the caudal furca of Nebalia
represented the telson of the Malacostraca, pointing out that a provisional caudal furca
is present in the protozoa of Sergestes and Pencus (1884).
