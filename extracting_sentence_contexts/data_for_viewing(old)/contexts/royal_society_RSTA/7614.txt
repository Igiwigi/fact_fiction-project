which corresponds to equation (2, 5) for p. But since (2, 11) is satisfied, the second
term on the left is negligible compared with the first, so that ¢ is very nearly equal to
e'E//4rem.u. Further, E, = ¢/« < 4no/e, i.e. E, < (€'/e) Ej, so that E, is in general

It will be observed that y enters into the differential equations only in the form V2y.
For certain distributions of « these equations will have a solution in which V*¥ is zero.
