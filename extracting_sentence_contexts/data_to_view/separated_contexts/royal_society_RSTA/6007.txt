Expansion of the Universe

In the text books and elsewhere, the most effective and pragmatic way of envisioning expansion
of the Universe is by taking the coordinate grid that expands. This is perfectly fine as a
computational tool and works excellently. The question I wish to pose relates to the fact that
expansion of the Universe means expansion of space-time which is a physical entity. It bends
or curves like a wire, and should therefore have microstructure with its discrete building blocks. Further discrete microstructure would also facilitate free propagation of zero mass particles or
electromagnetic and gravitational waves.
