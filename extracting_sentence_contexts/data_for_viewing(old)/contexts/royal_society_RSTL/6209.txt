and considering U=0 as the equation of a curve of the third order, the equations
ÞU= 0, &,U=0, 4=0 have the following significations, viz. OU=0 is the locus of a
int, such that its second or line polar with respect to the Hessian touches its first or
|. -% polar with respect to the cubic: ©,U is the locus of a point such that its second or
Yine polar with respect to the cubic touches its first or conic polar with respect to the
Fessian: and 4=0 is the locus of a point such that its second or line polar with
Sespect to the cubic, and its second or line polar with respect to the Hessian are reci-
grocals (that is, each passes through the pole of the other of them) with respect to the
-Zonie which is the enyelope of a line cutting the first or conic polar of the point with
Zespect to the cubic, and the first or conic polar of the point with respect to the Hessian
