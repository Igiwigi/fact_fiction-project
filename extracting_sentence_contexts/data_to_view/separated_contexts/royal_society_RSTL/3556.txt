The time occupied by the development of these animals extends through many
weeks. It is divisible into separate periods, which are most distinctly marked, but
the extent of which is influenced by external circumstances; and although in general
of a certain duration, it is more or less hastened, as in many true insects, by an abun-
dance or deficiency of food, and above all by the temperature of the surrounding me-
dium. I have been unable, from accidental loss of specimens, as well as from the time
required for their completion necessarily extending far beyond the present period, to
observe the whole of the changes as they occur throughout the entire life of the
species, but nevertheless have been able to extend my investigations sufficiently far
to enable me to record some remarkable facts, the occurrence of which, I have di-
stinctly ascertained, continues to the full development of the species, and indicates the
existence of one general lay or principle in the growth of this class of animals,
