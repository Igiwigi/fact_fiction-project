It is not necessary to reproduce these graphs, a brief account
of the phenomena observed being sufficient for the present purpose. Thus it is
found that the epidemic of 87 weeks’ period is wholly confined to the south of the
Thames, there being no evidence of its presence to any but a very slight extent in
any other part of London. The fact that this epidemic is confined in area gives it
very great local importance, the amplitude of the graph in its own district being
greater than that of the period of 97 weeks for the County of London as a whole. EPIDEMICS IN THE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS OF LONDON, 1890-1912. 183

‘Quite a different distribution is found for the epidemic of 97 weeks’ period. This
epidemic is well marked in all the divisions of London, but very specially marked
in the Western division in which it is present as the dominant epidemic.
