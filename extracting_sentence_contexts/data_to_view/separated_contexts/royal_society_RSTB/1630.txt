If the recovery took place during the execution of artificial respiration, the natural
respiratory movements occurred between the artificial ones. Very commonly at the commencement of the recovery, and occasionally also as the
respiratory centre died, the phenomenon of shallow respirations alternating with deep
ones was observed. After the fact of variability in depth, alteration in regularity of the rhythm is
the next most important factor. This was well exemplified in Experiments 9, 22, 32,
where it was seen that both the recovery and failure of the respiratory centre was
accompanied by great irregularity in the rhythm of its discharge. That the recovery of the respiratory centre is complete under the circumstances
just detailed, was tested by us in two ways, (1) by inducing asphyxia, (2) by dividing
the vagi.

(1.) Upon clamping the trachea the expiratory convulsive respiratory movements
which followed were in every respect characteristic of the usual disturbance of the
respiratory centre effected by asphyxia.

(2.) Division of the vagi called forth the typical deep inspiration, the prolonged
pause, and the collapsing expiration, characteristic of the section of these nerves,
