92 PROFESSOR A. SCHUSTER ON THE PERIODICITIES OF SUNSPOTS.

It should be noted that the first of the intervals of 13°5 years occurred previous
to 1649, and is not brought into the calculation of the periodogram, which shows
a decided maximum (fig. 1) for a period of 13°5 years. This period has evidently
been one of the characteristic ones during the time to which curve B (fig. 2) applies.
The fact that the maxima 1870°6 to 1883°9 are connected with it shows that it has
still been active till quite lately. If it does not appear in curve A (fig. 2), this is
accounted for by the fact that the first diffraction band of the 11 years’ period overlaps
and neutralises it. When the large period is eliminated, a rise at about 13 years
becomes apparent. The process of elimination is, however, difficult, and errors may
easily be introduced by means of it. There is evidence of two overlapping periods
here, the broadness of the rise in curve B (fig. 2) being one of the indications of the
duplicity. I refrain for the present, therefore, from discussing the period further.

15. Having found the average action of the 114 years’ period, we may eliminate
it from the general sunspot curve. The result is shown in fig. 6, in which the annual
