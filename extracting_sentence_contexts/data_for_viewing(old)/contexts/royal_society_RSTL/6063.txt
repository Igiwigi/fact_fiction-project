Theory of the Work, Heat, and Efficiency of Dry Saturated Steam.

In the following investigation it is assumed that the steam while expanding receives
just enough of heat to prevent any part of it from condensing, without super-heating it.
This assumption is founded on the fact, that dry steam is a bad conductor of heat as
compared with liquid water, or with cloudy steam, and that after cloudy steam has
received enough of heat to make it dry or nearly dry, it will probably receive little more.

The assumption is justified by the fact, that its results are confirmed by experiment.

The symbol Â» is used to denote the volume of one pound of steam in cubic feet, and
the symbol p to denote pressure in pounds 0n the square foot; 80 that pressure in pounds

on the square inch is denoted by =.

In fig. 2, as before, let CDG be the curve whose coordinates represent the volumes
and pressures of dry saturated steam.
