Dickâ€™s view is that they are promiscuously deposited crystals due to
electrolytic transfer of lead from the upper to the lower surface of the specimen. Careful microscopic examination shows that in some instances this is the case
in sheet lead. Some of the geometrical figures can be seen to be the outlines of
deposited, or at all events, projecting crystals ; but the remarkable fact remains that
even here these crystals are deposited with their elements in the same orientation
as those of the crystal upon which they are being deposited. In many cases, how-
ever, geometrical markings are found which form the outlines of pits instead of pro-
jections. Sometimes these pits occur on the same grain as the deposited crystals, and
both then have similar outline and orientation.
