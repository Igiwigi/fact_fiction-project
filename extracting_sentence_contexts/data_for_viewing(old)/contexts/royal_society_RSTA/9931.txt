8” (2), which is in accordance with what has been found in the previous cases. As
mentioned above, these were left out in finding the constants, as the chief end was to
get accurate values of N, and there was some doubt as to the form of the 8 formule
being correct. In comparison of Rayiercn’s lines we found probable errors in R. and
P.’s measurements, amounting to eight or ten times their estimates. If we take their
possible errors as only three times their estimates, very few of the calculated values
overstep these limits. It is interesting to note that the least square treatment
corroborates independently the errors determined from RayietcH’s interference
standards. Thus, in P’(2), the differences in n for m = 1.2.3.4 are —‘024, +12,
—'03, —'03, pointing to considerable error in P’(2). If the calculated correction of
IL. be applied to R. and P., the difference should have been —‘28. This would have
been in the course —*024, —*28, —°03, and then the method of least squares would
have brought these into close agreement. In fact, the considerable error in P’ (2) has
pulled the calculated values for P’ (1.3.4) out of their proper places. A similar result
is shown in 8”. If the calculated wave-length values of 8 (2.3) be compared with
R. and P.’s corrected values from II., the differences would be 2°75, ‘007, ‘007, instead
of 2°84, —:026, 007, and if they had been used to calculate the constants the agree-
ment would have been much closer. So the differences for D (2) would be diminished
from ‘545 to *525, but D(3) increased from 0 to —'019, D (2.3) increased from *005,
006 to —064, —‘024,

The values of N may be expected to depend to a few units on the weights allowed,
