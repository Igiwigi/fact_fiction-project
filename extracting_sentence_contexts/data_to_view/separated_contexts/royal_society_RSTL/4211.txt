BEECHEY ON THE TIDES IN

she will be benefited by standing in shore or otherwise; and will warn her of the
danger of drawing near the shores of Cardigan or Caernaryon Bays, with particular
tides and scant winds, and 80 likewise of the danger of standing close to the banks
skirting the Irish coast in light winds. But it is not to the navigator alone that these observations will, I hope, be found
useful : they will, I think, be interesting to men of science. Taken in connection
with the very valuable series of observations which were carried round Ireland by
the Ordnance at the snggestion of Professor Airy, we are made acquainted with
several curious facts : first, that whilst it is high water at one end of the channel, it

Peculiar

Io nog is low water at the other; that the same stream makes both high and low water at
I = the same time; that there are two spots in the channel, in one of which the stream
SN runs with considerable velocity without the water either rising or falling, and in the
5 other, that the water rises and falls from sixteen to twenty feet without having any
bg visible horizontal motion of its surface; and that during the first half of the flowing,
5 and last half of the ebbing, tide-wave, the stream in the south channel runs in a
=) contrary direction to the wave, and goes up an ascent of about one foot in 44 miles. S (See Plate IV.)
5 To the lines of direction of the stream I have added the rate of the tide at its

Â© the channel; point out the situations in which the meeting of the tides occurs;
S and offer such remarks on the course of the stream and upon the tidal pheno-
E mena of this sea, as will, I conceive, benefit the navigator, and be interesting to
= Science,
Z An inspection of the chart (Plate IT.) will show that the tide enters the Irish Sea by
<= two channels; of which Carnsore Point and Pembroke are the limits of the southern
E one, and Rathlin and the Mull of Kintire the boundaries of the northern.
