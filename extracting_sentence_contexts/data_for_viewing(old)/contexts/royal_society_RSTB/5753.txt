Ina molecular weight estimation by the Rast method, 0-00284 gm. caused a depression
of 13-88° C. in the melting point of 0-03432 gm. of camphor. This figure corresponds
to a molecular weight of 237 while the molecular weight of C,,H,0, is 236.

To test the possibility of this material possessing a lactone or anhydride structure,
a small quantity of it was boiled with very dilute NaOH for one hour, cooled, and the
mixture titrated to neutrality using phenolphthalein as indicator. The amount of
NaOH used in this hydrolysis by 0-0719 gm. of material was 2-89 c.c. of N/10 NaOH.
This amount of oxidation product, C,s;H,,0,, would require 3-05 c.c. of N/10 NaOH to
neutralise an opened lactone structure and 6-10 ¢.c. to neutralise an anhydride structure.
The product is therefore probably of the lactone type.

As far as can be assumed from the foregoing facts it appears that the
oxidation product obtained by the action of alkaline permanganate on dimethyl A
has the empirical formula C,;H,,0,, contains two methoxyl groups, and has probably
a lactone structure.

(3) Products obtained by fusing product A with potassium hydrowide.—As already
noted, p. 288, product A is resistant to the action of boiling aqueous 30 per cent. alkali.
Accordingly 4 gm. of A were fused in a nickel crucible with 15 gm. of potassium hydroxide
and 8 c.c. of water. The crucible was heated in a bath of fusible metal maintained at
a temperature of 300° C. for 14 hours. The mass became semi-fluid, darkened in colour
and swelled, with apparent evolution of gas. At the close of the heating period the
mixture was allowed to cool, dissolved in about 100 c.c. of cold water, and this solution
saturated with CO, gas. This caused the precipitation of a crystalline phenolic
