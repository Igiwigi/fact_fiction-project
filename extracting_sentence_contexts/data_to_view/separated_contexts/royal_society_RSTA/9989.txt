The exceptional equation Y,, «,°°—a," = 0, gives us again a necessary condition for

and so on for the equations for each of the first ¢, columns of 7. For the (¢,+1) column, however, the non-diagonal term of y,,,; = 0 and the
equations for this column do not contain the elements of the preceding column. In fact, the « columns beginning with the (¢+1) form a group related to one
another in just the same manner as the first ¢, are. We obtain from them, as from
the latter, the conditions

condition.” Supposing those already found to be satisfied, we may return to the
solution of the equations X, and of these the following statements are to be
proved :—
