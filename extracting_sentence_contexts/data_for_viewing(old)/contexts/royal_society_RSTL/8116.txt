4. As to the other two equations, writing for g, their values, these become

J+6t+8i+58 +67 =d(2n—4)—29,
2x+3u+4i+188+5y=ec(bn—12)—6r+30,

equations which admit of a geometrical interpretation. In fact, when there is only a
nodal curve, the first equation is

J+6t=b(2—4)— 2g,

which we may verify when the nodal curve is a complete intersection, P=0, Q=0 ; for
if the equation of the surface is (A, B, CFP, Q)*=0, where the degrees of A, B, C, P.Q
are n—2f, n—f—g, n—29, f, g respectively, then the pinch-points are given by the
equations P=0, Q=0, AC—B*=0, and the number j of pinch-points is thus

=fg(2m—2f—2g)=(2Mm—A4fg—2Yu(F+9—2);
but for the curve P=0, Q=0 we have #=0, and its order and class are 6=fq.
a=f9(f+9—2), or the formula is thus verified.
