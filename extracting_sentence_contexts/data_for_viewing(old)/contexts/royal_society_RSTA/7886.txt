The results are set out in fig. 4. The behaviour of the sulphate is as remarkable as
that of the azide. As before, the effect of acidity of the dextrine is to flatten the
curve and lower the absorption limit. In neutral solution the limit of absorption
must be much higher.


ON THE CONSTITUTION OF CRYSTALS OF LEAD SALTS 139

Lead Chloride and Dextrine

Precipitations were made with lead nitrate and potassium chloride. The satura-
tion limit in this case is more clearly marked. Itis about 3-7% of the weight of the
crystals. The whole curve is, in fact, almost coincident with that representing a
previous set of experiments in which the lead chloride was allowed to crystallize
out slowly from a saturated hot solution as it cooled (fig. 1), and the saturation value
is practically the same as that given by the other very different method (3-6%).

Lead Iodide

The absorption of dextrine by lead iodide during its growth is much less than for
any of the other salts, and the curve—fig. 4—is nearly straight. It has already been
noticed that dextrine, as well as other colloids, has little power to affect the crystalliza-
tion of this compound.
