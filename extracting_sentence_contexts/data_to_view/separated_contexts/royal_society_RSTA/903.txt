'=0 ~~ (Al) This compact relation is most inclusive, and with its aid the majority of transforma-
tions of partial first derivatives can be effected simply and quickly. It will be
observed that the important relation, (4), follows at once by rearrangement ;
putting z=, and w = 8, (41) reduces to (2) or (3) ; in fact, by simple substitu-
tions and rearrangements, relations (1) to (32) may all be deduced progressively
from (41). It is obvious that by means of this equation, we may express any one J (7, 5) in
terms of five others, provided that each variable is completely determined by any
chosen two which are independent. If« and @ are chosen from among the variables
included in the expression (41), we find, since J («, 8) = 1, that any one J (7, s) may
be expressed in terms of four others ; this is equivalent to saying that any one ratio
of two Jacobians in (41) (and thus any partial first derivative) is expressible in terms
of four others.
