In the light of recent research, these structures can no longer be considered as
organs sui generis, but are typical examples of the primitive type of true nephridia,
as found in many adult Polychets and Amphiowus, and larvee such as those of
Echiurus* and Phoronis.

The recent description of the early stages ot segmentation by WoLTErREck (29)
renders it unnecessary for me to more than briefly touch on them here. Polygordius
belongs to that rather limited class of animals with equal holoblastic segmentation of
the spiral type, of which the eggs of Thalassema, Lepidonotus, and Eupomatus are
well-known examples. In fact, the cleavage of Hupomatus resembles so closely that
of Polygordius, that up to the 32-cell stage one set of drawings would almost do for
both. Once cleavage has set in, it progresses rapidly and uniformly till the 64-cell
stage. About this time the blastula has already flattened out into its characteristic
disc-like condition.
