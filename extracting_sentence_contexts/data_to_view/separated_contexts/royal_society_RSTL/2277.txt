In the Papilio urtice, LINN. [fig. 37.], and P. 16, Lixx., the ganglia are exceedingly
large compared with the size of the cords. When examined with a very strong light,
the motor column may be seen from the under surface of the cords through the gan-
glia quite distinet from the sensitive, and it continnes 80 along the sides of the cords
into the nerves of the wings. This is an interesting fact, on account of the wings
being supplied with nerves in Papilio, Lixx., directly from the cords, and not as in
Sphinx from the cords and ganglia. The motor nerves pass around the exterior of
the ganglia, and the column itself passes over them, exactly the same as in other
Articuata,

We have thus a series of facts which distinctly show the existence of a neryous
system analogous to that of yertebrated animals through all the higher Articulata ;
and it cannot be doubted that the same structure exists throughout all the articu-
