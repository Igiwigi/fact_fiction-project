(Nis) in diamond that has Tz symmetry. Nis introduces d orbitals to the electronic structure
that presumably is also a subject of spin-orbit coupling, and partial occupation of degenerate
d states could lead to the JT effect. As we shall show below, a very general group theory
analysis of degenerate orbitals in Tz symmetry is required for understanding this type of defect
system.

The Nis configuration in diamond was observed in the electron paramagnetic resonance : =
(EPR) spectra that is labelled as W8 [11-13]. After the discovery of W8 EPR centre [11], the : =
milestone experiments in the identification of Nis were (i) the fingerprint of °!Ni isotope in :8
the EPR spectrum with the hyperfine interaction between the electron spin and I = 3/2 nuclear : =
spin in isotopically 61Ni enriched HPHT diamond samples [12] and (ii) observation of S =3/2 :8
electron spin with hyperfine signals of four identical 13C I = 1/2 nuclear spins [13]. The W8 EPR [3
centre exhibits an isotropic g = 2.0310 + 0.0005 tensor. These facts imply that the defect has Ty [8
symmetry. Furthermore, S = 3/2 spin state indicates that it is a substitutional defect in the negative : 3
charge state, i.e. Ni; . This model was later confirmed by additional measurements and ab initio : S
calculations [14-19]. The ground state of Ni; is well understood: Ni, introduces a five times ‘Ss

degenerate d orbital of which level splits due to the tetrahedral crystal field of diamond as a triple
degenerate one (f2) lying in the fundamental band gap, whereas the double degenerate d orbital (e)
is resonant with the valence band. The in-gap f2 level is occupied by three electrons in the negative
charge state which establishes the paramagnetic S = 3/2 state. This electronic configuration is the
4A orbital singlet multiplet state in Ty symmetry.

The correlation between the Ni-related optical centres and the W8 EPR centre were studied
either indirectly such as common appearance in the appropriate optical and EPR spectra with
