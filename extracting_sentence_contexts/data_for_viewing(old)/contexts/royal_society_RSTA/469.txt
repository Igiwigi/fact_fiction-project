for the discovery of ‘new facts’, but bereft of any lasting explanatory worth [28]. Priestley
modelled the version of phlogiston he used in ‘Observations’ on Cavendish’s appeal to the
standard Stahlian notion of a generic ‘principle of inflammability’ (present in all combustible
substances, including metals) to explain the production of inflammable air from dilute metal-
acid solutions [18, Part 1, pp. 43-45, Part II, pp. 104-105]. But Priestley soon loosened phlogiston
from its tradition identification with the principle of inflammability, turning it into a veritable
Proteus of cosmic proportion [18, Part III, pp. 158-164; 29]. He developed a phlogistic account of
the role of respiration, which emitted phlogiston, and vegetation, which reabsorbed it, in the
balanced economy of nature. Towards the end of his life, he detected a ‘regular graduation’,
from most pure to least pure, of dephlogisticated air, common air, phlogisticated air and
nitrous air, and suggested ‘all these kinds of air differ chiefly in the quantity of phlogiston they
contain’ [19, p. 179]. Whatever status or function Priestley ascribed to phlogiston, he never
lost sight of its hypothetical nature and its inferior epistemological status vis-a-vis the facts
it unearthed.

Priestley’s associationist view of the passivity of the knowing mind, bereft of preconceived
opinion and attuned to the deterministic structure of nature, established ‘facts’, or congeries
of ‘sensible properties’, as completely determined by external reality [23, pp. 348-357,
374-380]. Hypotheses about the underlying causes—such as chemical compositions or
reaction mechanisms—of these sensible properties and their modifications threatened, if
not clearly distinguished from the facts of the matter, to sully objective knowledge with
mere opinion, subtle bias or outright dogma. For Priestley, the fundamental business of
