3" afterwards amounted to 0:18 mm., and 8" afterwards to 0:07 mm., and that the
film disturbed by the current had the greater surface tension.

At 15" the current was sent up the right film for 12% The coloured rings dis-
appeared.

At 19® the right film was faintly coloured, and

The disturbance produced by the current was less than before, which is accounted
for by the fact that the film, though colourless, was really thinner than when it was
previously applied, and thus, the resistance in circuit being greater, the current was
weaker. That the film was thinner is proved by the fact that, whereas after the first
application of the current the right film remained for the mos part colourless for eight
minutes, on the second occasion it showed faint colours after four minutes. This
observation shows that in a film which is not very thick the current may be pasxed
for a few seconds without leaving any trace of its action three minutes afterwards,
but unfortunately it also proves that s8uch treatment is not sufficient to prevent the
film from thinning.

At 20” the current was sent up the right film for 205, and the following measure-
ments were made ;—
