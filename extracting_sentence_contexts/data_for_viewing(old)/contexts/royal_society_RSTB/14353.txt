ary features, as well as areas that merit further investigation.
Unsurprisingly, given the diversity represented within the
crustaceans, we found that the opsin repertoire expressed in
different orders, and even within orders, is highly variable.
While we can only speculate about orders for which no
data are available, we can assume that more interesting
vision-related stories will surely emerge from this group.

The results of our analysis, which represents the most
comprehensive sampling of opsin diversity in the crustaceans
at this time, align with the hypothesized visual opsin reper-
toire of the ancestral pancrustacean proposed by Henze &
Oakley [18]. Given the fact that our study focused on opsin
diversity within the crustaceans, we are not able to make
further conclusions about the diversification events that
gave rise to these major opsin clades. However, we see diver-
sification in many crustacean orders, with the number of
opsins found often exceeding expectations in both visual
and non-visual opsin clades. Some orders, such as those
within the class Hexanauplia, appear to have specialized in
one or two types of visual opsins. Others, such as orders
within the Malacostraca, possess sequences from all major
opsin clades but with large amounts of duplication in
either the LWS or MWS.
