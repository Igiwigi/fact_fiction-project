Gallocarbonic acid has a melting point of over 270° C. with evolution
of carbon dioxide. With very dilute ferric chloride it gives a violet colour, with more
concentrated, a greenish brown colour. As the result of more recent work, however, by
Voswincket and pe Wrerrs (1912), and Fetsr and SanpstEbE (1918) it seems certain
that gallocarbonic acid is not a phthalic acid derivative but an iso-phthalic acid

derivative of the following formula :—
COOH

HO an
wt Lie

WA
OH

In view of these facts, together with considerations arising from the results obtained
by the hydrolysis of O-dimethylcitromycetin methyl ester (see p. 237), it is probable
that the trihydroxyphthalic acid isolated from the hydrolytic products of citromycetin
is represented by formula (b) and is indeed 3:5: 6-trihydroxy phthalic acid. A further experiment was carried out with a view to estimating the volatile materials
produced by alkaline hydrolysis of citromycetin. 3-38 gm. of pure citromycetin were
