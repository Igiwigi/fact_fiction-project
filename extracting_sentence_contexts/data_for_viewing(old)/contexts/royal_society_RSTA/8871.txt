a measure of the number of electrons whose kinetic energy when emitted exceeds the
equivalent applied retarding potential difference. It should, in fact, be equal to the
number of such electrons divided by the electronic charge. A characteristic curve
satisfying such conditions for the case of the concentric spherical electrodes will there-
fore solve the problem so far as the total kinetic energy is concerned. Stated in this
way the matter appears very simple, but it has been found in practice to be fraught
with very serious difficulties which have taken a long time to overcome.

In all the experiments the metal acted on was a liquid alloy of sodium and potassium.
In the majority of them this had an initial composition corresponding to the formula
NaK,. The alloy of this formula appears* to have the lowest melting point, and it is
a quite mobile liquid at room temperatures. In some of the early experiments an alloy
of higher melting point having the initial composition NaK was used. This fact will
be mentioned when it is necessary to refer to those experi-
ments. Where no specific reference to the composition of the
alloy is made, it can be assumed that it was close to that
given by the formula NaK,. There is reason to believe that as
the alloy is used the potassium is consumed faster than the
sodium, with a consequent increase in the viscosity of the
alloy. This effect is not so noticeable with the alloy Nak, as
with NaK, which after a time becomes almost solid.

After a certain amount of preliminary skirmishing with
apparatus of different designs, that finally used in the measure-
ment of the characteristic curves for concentric spheres is
