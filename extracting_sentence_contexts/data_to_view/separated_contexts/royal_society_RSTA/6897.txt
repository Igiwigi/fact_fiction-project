This result relates the function P_,_,(w) to the function 7,(w) of §11. Returning to the case

of H(D), we shall still have z” = s Vixl¥(z)]* and may define, formally,

¥_4-1(2Z) = PA sa

It would be interesting to know in what neighbourhood of infinity (if any) this function is
regular, and whether any of the properties found for the special cases extend to this more
general case.
