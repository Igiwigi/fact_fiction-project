2738. A cylinder of soft iron had the central parts removed in a
lathe, until it had assumed the form of an hour-glass, or that repre-
sented in fig. 3, which is to a scale of one-third. When placed be- SD
tween the poles of the magnet instead of the former box, it was ex-

pected that the continuation of the iron throughout would prevent any diminution
of its length, from the pressure of the poles (2734.), and that the diamagnetic pheno-
mena would be abundantly produced in the parts from whence the iron had been
removed. The latter was found to he the fact, for flame, smoke, bismuth and other
diamagnetic matter, when placed there, passed equatorially very freely.

2739. A copper tube, 2:5 inches long, made of metal 0-1 of an inch thick, was fitted
to the iron, 80 that when in its place it should occupy the position represented (fig. 3),
and could easily be made perfectly gas-tight by a little soft cement. In this way it
formed an annular air-chamber round the iron, which, when measnred, was found to
have a capacity of rather more than 2 cabic inches, and included the most intense
part of the magnetic field. Three stopcocks were fitted into this copper jacket, by
two of which gas was passed into and ont of the chamber, and the third was appro-
priated to the pressure-gange as before. Whilst naked, this apparatus conld not be
used, because of its ever-varying temperature, and the consequent disturbance and
ejectment of the fluid in the gauge; but when clothed in three thicknesses of flannel
