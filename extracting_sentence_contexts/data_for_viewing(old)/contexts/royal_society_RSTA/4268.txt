This is the main postulate, the (matrix) multiplication postulate, of Heisenberg’s new theory,
‘and in fact this type of combination is an almost necessary consequence of the frequency
combination rules’ ([32], p. 265). This combination of the particular arrangement of the data and
the construction of an algebra of multiplying his new variables is Heisenberg’s great invention.
(As I noted, although some of them satisfy the canonical commutation relation, these matrices
do not form an algebra with respect to the composition.) The ‘naturalness’ of this assumption
should not hide the radical and innovative nature of this assumption or indeed discovery, one of Lo
the greatest in twentieth-century physics, even all physics. :

Although it is commutative in the case of squaring a given variable, x”, this multiplication is a
in general non-commutative, expressly for position and momentum variables, and Heisenberg, 3
without quite realizing it, used this non-commutativity in solving his equation, as Dirac was {8
the first to notice. Taking his inspiration from Einstein’s ‘new kinematics’ of special relativity, :
Heisenberg spoke of his new algebra of matrices as the ‘new kinematics’. This was not the fA
