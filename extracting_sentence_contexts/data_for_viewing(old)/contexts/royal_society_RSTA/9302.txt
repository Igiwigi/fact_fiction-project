subsequently obtained by Lancrvin} and the present author§$ on the most general
molecular hypothesis, in the form (13°06). Maxwen1’s first formula related to the
elastic sphere theory, and was greater than that of Sreran by one-third, MaxweLl
being considerably in error: his second formula related to Maxwellian molecules, and
was identical with the exact formula for such molecules given in §13 (0). All these
results share the property that they are independent of », : »,, and as the present theory
shows, all of them are in error in this respect, except MAXWELL’s second formula.
They require to be multiplied by the correcting factor V//V of (13°03) : this factor is
unity in the case of Maxwellian molecules, so that for a mixture of two sets of such
molecules D,, is independent of their numerical proportions. This is one of the few
properties of a gas which depends in its very nature (7.e., not merely in absolute
magnitude) on a particular molecular model: another such property will, be noticed
in $14, The fact that the absence of variation is in disagreement with experimental
results confirms the conclusion drawn from other sources of evidence that Maxwellian
molecules are unsatisfactory representations of actual molecules.

The only other general case of independence of D,, or »,:», is that in which the
dynamical properties of the two sets of molecules are alike, as in the case of self-
diffusion (§ 13 (f)). Hence we may speak of the coefficient of self-diffusion of a gas
without specifying the ratio »,:», in contemplation ; in general, on the contrary, D,,
is defined only when the value of », : v, is assigned.

In the case when m,/m, is negligible (§ 13 (e)) the mutual encounters of the light
molecules are neglected, with the result that in this case also D,, depends only on 1.
This, however, is perhaps hardly to be regarded as an additional exception to the
