Received June 17,â€”Read June 17, 1858. FRAUNHOFER, in his original measurements of the fixed lines of the spectrum, noted the
thermometer, and those who since his time have occupied themselves with the determi-
nation of refractive indices, must have frequently noticed that changes of temperature
affect the amount of refraction ; yet of the many observations now on record, few have
affixed to them the temperature at which they were made. Bapex POWELL has drawn
out some refractive indices of the same substance taken 'at different temperatures, but
remarks that the whole subject, both as to the facts of the case and as to their bear-
ing on the theoretical formulze, remains to be investigated *. Among his beautiful
researches on light, M, Javix has recently published one or two experiments on refrac-
tion, heat, and density+; but, with this exception, he has left untouched the great ques-
tion of the influence of temperature. Some years ago Bapex PoweLL kindly lent his instrument to one of us for the pur-
pose of investigating this question.
