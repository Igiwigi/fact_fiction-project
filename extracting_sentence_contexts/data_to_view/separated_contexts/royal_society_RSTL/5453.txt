This same proposition leads us to explain the fact discovered by M. Du Bots REYMOND,
namely, that a current is obtained by touching with the plates of the galvanometer
the central points and the edge of the same transverse section of a large muscle. In
fact, the central points belong to the longest muscular fibres, and therefore play the same
part towards the points near the edge of this section belonging to the shortest fibres, as
the interior of a muscle towards its surface.


134 PROFESSOR MATTEUCCT'S ELECTRO-PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCHES. I take this opportunity of calling attention to a fundamental difference existing between
a muscular electromotor and a voltaic pile. Let us take an entire muscle, such as the
thigh of a frog, and cut it in half: it is known that the two sections thus formed have
the same electrical state, and that a pile can be formed by placing in contact the internal
section of one of the halt-thighs with the superficies of the other.
