After
all, both communities are interested in the interface between
neurobiologically wired cognitive and behavioural abilities. It
could be more challenging to deepen the dialogue between
economists and biologists [52]. A retrospect look at the flour-
ishing of neuroeconomics in the past 20 years leads to the
following ambivalent observation: economic conceptual con-
structs borrowed by neuroscientists and other biologists have
either been taken in an a-theoretical way (utility, value,
decisions and their likes are in fact heavily loaded theoretical
terms that are often mistakenly taken as primitives) or have
been unduly simplified, owing to their wide divulgation out
of the initial decision-theoretical context in which they were
born (especially Prospect Theory). It is possible that we have
reached a stage at which the benefits taken from this conceptual
or model translation from economics to biology are marginally
diminishing. A deeper understanding of what economic
theory of human behaviour and institutions is about could
yield a deeper epistemological integration of biology, psychol-
ogy and economics.
