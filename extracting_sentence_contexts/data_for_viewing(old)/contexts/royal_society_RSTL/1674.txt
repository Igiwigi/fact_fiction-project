carefully scummed' off, the worms in the water die in less
than twelve hours.

This glutinous substance must be secreted by the worms ;
since in grains in which the worms and the fungi or smut-
balls exist, that portion of the cellular tissue of the young
germens, where a worm has formed its nest and laid its eggs,
is entirely preserved ; whilst in those portions of the grains
which are immediately in contact with the fungi, the cellular
tissue entirely disappears, and the fungi are only enveloped
by the external tunic of the young germen.

Fromthese facts, we are to consider this glutinous substance
as the' probable cause of preserving these minute animals for
such a length of time. What is recorded of the shell-snail,
which- can,. by its own' mucus, hermetically seal itself for
thirty years'in its'shell against a wall, is similar to this: when

the mucus is dissolved, the air in the lungs is rarified, and
forces its way out, 80 that fresh air rushes into the lungs, and
it recovers.
