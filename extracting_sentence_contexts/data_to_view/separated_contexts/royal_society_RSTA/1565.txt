We study whether replacing stochastic excitations with deterministic ones can be a
viable approach to qualitatively describing the dynamic behaviour of stochastic systems.

2. On the vibrational resonance phenomenon and replacing noise with high-
frequency excitations for bi-stable systems

In paper [9], a ‘deterministic’ explanation of stochastic resonance has been proposed that does
not imply considering the Fokker-Planck equation or directly solving the stochastic equation. This explanation is based on the fact that stochastic resonance is in many respects similar to the
ordinary vibrational resonance [10] that occurs in deterministic dynamic systems with the noise
replaced with a high-frequency harmonic signal with frequency w > @ and amplitude H. High-
frequency excitation modifies the effective dynamic properties of the system, which can lead to a
resonance (increased response) at the frequency 2. Using this analogy, the stochastic resonance
phenomenon is ‘explained’ as follows: the high-frequency part of the noise spectrum modifies
the dynamic properties of the system, and the low-frequency part of the spectrum acts on the
modified system.
