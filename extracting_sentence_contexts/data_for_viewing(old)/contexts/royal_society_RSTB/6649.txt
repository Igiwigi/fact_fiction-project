correspond to the paracone and metacone, in which case in later development each of
these would have split into two to give the mature arrangement of four cusps on the
lateral cingulum. This is very unlikely, especially as the paracone is the first cusp to
develop ontogenetically in the upper molars (TAEKER 1892; Rsk 1892; ADLOFF 19034),
whereas in Ornithorhynchus the first cusp to arise is the antero-medial one, the cusps on
the lateral border appearing much later.


404 H. L. H. H. GREEN ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND

In the lower teeth a possible theoretical resemblance to the typical tuberculosectorial
arrangement can be made out if it can be supposed (a) that the smaller cusps are in
fact more or less constant, and (b) that these cusps originally possessed a greater
significance than they do now. The main cusps would be the protoconid and the
hypoconid.

However, these homologies are extremely unlikely ; the early ontogenetic appearance
of the hypocone (and indeed its appearance at all in such a primitive form), and the
reduction to such a degree of the paracone and metacone, make a derivation from the
tuberculosectorial type very improbable.

The symmetrodont teeth bear no relation to those of the monotremes. The Sym-
metrodonta have a single, tall, medial cusp in the upper molars, with accessory anterior
and posterior cusps carried on its lateral slopes, and vice versa in the case of the lower
teeth. They are interlocking and shearing teeth, whereas the teeth of Ornithorhynchus
