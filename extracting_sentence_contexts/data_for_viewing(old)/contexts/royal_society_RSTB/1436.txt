Our knowledge of the organization of Sphenophyllum is now fairly comp .
have not, it is true, been able ourselves to say anything as to the structure oj]
roots, nor to give any detailed account of the leaves. Considerable inforn
these points, as regards other species of the genus, will however be four
works of M. Renautt, cited above. But though Sphenophyllum is now,
plant, very thoroughly known, it still seems to us impossible to deter
affinities. That it is a vascular Cryptogam there can be no doubt, nor has thi
questioned by any modern writer. Among the vascular Cryptogams, Spheng
must rank as one of the most highly organized geneva, on account both of the
histological complexity of its vegetative organs, and of the peculiar morpholo
fructification. However we may interpret the latter, it certainly has
specialized character. In fact Sphenophyllum affords yet another exam
Carboniferous Cryptogam, which, so far from representing a primitive type, is inna:
ways more elaborately modified than any recent forms.

It is not surprising that the most various systematic positions have been asy
to the genus by different authors. For example, ScHENK, VAN TIEGH
others, have placed it near Lycopodiaceee ; STUR refers it to Calamariex, B
to Salviniacese, while ZeruLER has recently traced a relationship, on the one
Marsiliacess, and on the other to Ophioglossew. Mr. Kipsron thinks tl
Sphenophylla form a peculiar group of plants, which, though standing clos
Lycopods, cannot be included with them, but must be placed in a class b
selves—the Sphenophyllex.”* Count Soums-LauBacH also places these p
class of their own, thinking it best “to renounce for the present all forced
