RuinTouL, their Research Director, and his staff. We would also thank Mr. F. Wrrr,
B.Se., A.R.C.S., who was enabled by a maintenance grant from the Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research to render us effective assistance, especially with the
experiments described in Part I hereof, and Messrs. D. A. Winer, B.Sc., A.R.CS.,
and F. Laks, B.Sc., A.R.C.S. (Gas Research Fellows), for similar assistance during its
later stages.

ADDENDUM.

We desire to say that, after this memoir had been sent in to the Society, and while
certain alterations were being made in the explosion tube used in our said detonation
experiments in preparation for another series, we became aware of a fact which affords
a striking proof of the correctness of the explanation referred to. It is often observed
that when a glass section is added as an extension of a lead explosion tube in which
“detonation” has been determined, the inner surface of the glass section gradually
becomes coated with a thin grey film of lead, presumably owing to particles of the
metal being torn off the inner surface of the lead tube by the detonating medium and
deposited by it further on in the glass section. In this case, we found that not only
had such a film been so deposited on the inner surface of the glass tube after six
successive detonations of the moist 2CO ++ O, mixture, but there had been traced on
it by the detonating mixture (as a darker track) the actual helical path of the
detonating ‘‘ head,” which curiously enough had apparently been the same in all six
experiments. In other words, the rotating localised “‘ head’ of detonation had thus
actually traced its own path along the glass section of the tube, as shown in the
