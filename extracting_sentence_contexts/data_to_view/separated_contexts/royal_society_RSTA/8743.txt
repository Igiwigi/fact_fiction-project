That the point A will not be far from that which corresponds to the condition of zero
electric field between the two electrodes, i.e., V + K = 0, might be anticipated on the
following grounds. The data in fig. 3, and still more in fig. 4, indicate that there is no
considerable direct effect of the applied field in helping the electron emission. In fact,
I have frequently made explicit tests to see if the part DE of the curve slopes upwards,
as appears to be suggested by the points in fig. 4, but I have never been able to convince
myself that it does. Some experiments have given a small increase, some a small
decrease, and others no change with rising voltage. This is a point which deserves
further examination, but if there is any effect * of this kind it is certainly small.
