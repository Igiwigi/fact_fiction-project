Without loss of generality, assume that
D(to) > 0. This gives us that E(to) > 0 by definition and F(t) <0 by (5.3). Considering this, (5.5)
and the fact that x, y € C*(to, f2), we have that there exists t € (fo, f1] such that F(r) = 0 and F(t) <0


for all t € (to, t). In particular, this means that, by integrating F with respect to s € (to, t), we have

I; F(s)ds <0 (5.6)

to

and, setting t = t in (5.4), we have

I. E(s)ds =0. (5.7)

to

Then, by integrating (5.4) with respect to t € (to, t) and using (5.6), we obtain

where the last equality is a consequence of Fubini’s theorem and (5.7).
