intensity of are) (log of photo. intensity of line)"

which is the formula already deduced in this section, with the variable I, removed by
substitution of absolute intensity divided by photographic intensity in the are, to
which it is proportional. The dispersion ratio automatically cancels from the
formula in this second case, as in fact it should in the present method whenever two
magnitudes at the same wave-length, which involve a consideration of a range dd in
the neighbourhood of this wave-length, are to be compared. (VIL) The Helium Spectrum under Different Conditions.
