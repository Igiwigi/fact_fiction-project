The intrinsic musculature consists
of powerful circular muscles (fig. 18, c.m.). The fibres of these circular muscles
give branches anteriorly and posteriorly in the middle of the dorsal side so as to
constitute a dorsal longitudinal muscle (figs. 17, 18, d.l.p.). The absence of well-
developed longitudinal musculature in both the sections of the pharynx is associated
with the fact that the function of the longitudinal muscles is taken up by their
dilators. Harms (1912, p. 187) failed to find any longitudinal muscle in this section
of the stomodaeum. The circular muscles at its junction with the crop are more
closely placed and powerful.
