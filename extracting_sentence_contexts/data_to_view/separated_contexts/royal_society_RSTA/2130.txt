Tn the case of the combined subsequent and previous pulses, the departures of the
primary crests from 0 are negligible, and it suffices to give the lengths calculated for
the intervals. The departures from 27 and from, 54 days are all very trifling, and in the case of the
19 years the departure from, 108 days is the least of any. he fact that the departure
from, 81 days has the same sign for the group of years of few sunspots as for the others
may appear inconsistent with what was said in discussing fig. 3. It is due to the relatively
low values of the characters for days 82 and 83 as compared with days 80 and 79
respectively.
