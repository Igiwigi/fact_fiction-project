Wavelet analysis is probably the most popular technique;
a review of condition monitoring applications is found in reference [18]. In terms of an online
implementation, the application of time-scale methods is less costly than a fast Fourier transform
(FFT). In fact, the discrete wavelet transform can be carried out in O(N) operations compared with
O(N logN) for the FFT. Some examples of WT applications in condition monitoring are given
in [19-23]. Other common time-frequency methods are Cohen class time-frequency distributions such as
the Wigner-Ville (WVD) and the Choiâ€”Williams (CWD) distributions.
