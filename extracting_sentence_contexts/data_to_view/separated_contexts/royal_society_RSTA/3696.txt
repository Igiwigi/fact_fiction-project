with calorimeter D at 28째째0 C., which would give 4째1805 at 29째10 C.

(37.) Variation of the Gradient-Correction with Temperature. The importance of this correction arises chiefly from the fact that the value of the
heat-loss increases with rise of temperature for any calorimeter. As a result, the
correction, which depends on the square of the heat-loss, is considerably larger at
higher temperatures, and thus affects the curve of variation of the specific heat as
well as the absolute values. If the correction were constant, it would affect only the
absolute values, which would matter little owing to the uncertainty of the electrical
units.
