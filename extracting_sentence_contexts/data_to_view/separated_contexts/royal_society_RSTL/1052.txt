The difficulties which were opposed to the conveyance of the
semen by the tubes, were, as we should suspect, intended to
prepare the way for a different explanation ; therefore physio-
logists, by a very natural transition of thought, were led to
suppose that the presence of semen in the vagina alone was
sufficient to account for impregnation. In order to give support to this opinion, cases were adduced,
in which, from some anatomical peculiarities, it seemed almost
impossible that the fecundating fluid could be conveyed into
the uterus; and yet in several of these cases impregnation had
really taken place. It would be digressing too much to state
the facts in detail, sceing that in this inquiry I deduce nothing
from them; nor would such statement solve the problem be-
fore us. The facts are already in the possession of physiolo-
gists, but are not admitted as satisfactory proofs. Those who
hold the contrary opinion, either cavil at the accuracy of the
Statement, or draw a different conclusion; therefore to attempt
conviction by these materials would be to engage in the service
of forlorn hope.
