are not of ‘diagonal’ nature while expressed in our choice of CMCSH gauge.” This problem is ZR
circumvented by constructing a Lyapunov functional using D. Christodolou’s energy current [3
[15,35]. Using the monotonic decay property of this Lyapunov functional for sufficiently small :8
data, it is shown that the perturbed solutions are globally well posed to the future and moreover :8
that they decay to the nearby solutions with constant negative scalar curvature. This result : S
however required that the adiabatic index should lie in suitable range (yq € (1, (n + 1)/n), i.e. that 7S

the perturbations are restricted to lie within the so-called ‘sound cone’).

In 3+1 dimensions, the fixed points are characterized by the condition that the metric be
negative Einstein. Following Mostow rigidity, this automatically implies that the manifold be
hyperbolic. Contrary to the situation in 3+ 1 dimensions, the fixed points are not isolated in
higher dimensions. This is due to the fact that the Einstein moduli space is finite dimensional
for n>3 (but collapses to a point for 1 =3). Such cases are handled by invoking a ‘shadow’
gauge introduced by [26]. Here however, we only state the result for the physically interesting
3+ 1 dimensional case where such moduli spaces do not appear. The following theorem states
the stability and asymptotic properties of the small data perturbations of the special solutions
described by (5.1) and (5.2)
