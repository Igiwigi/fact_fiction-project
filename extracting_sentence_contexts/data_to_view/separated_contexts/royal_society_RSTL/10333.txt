Dactylis glomerata, Lolium perenne, and Avena pubescens, were also each
more or less in deficiency on plots 19 and 20. Cynosurus eristatus and Anthozanthum |
odoratum were, on the other hand, in some excess. It was, in fact, in the poorer
grasses—Mestuca ovina, Agrostis vulgaris, and Holeus lanatus—that the two newer
plots showed the greatest excess over plot 16 in the first, of the two Separation-years. In the second separation-year, however, there was either a deficiency, or a less excess |
of these, as compared with their yield on plot 16; whilst those which were in the
greatest deficiency in the first separation-year on the newer plots compared with the |
older one, were the better grasses Alopecurus pratensts and Avena flavescens, each of |

which had gained, both in actual and relative amount, compared with 16, by the
second separation-year. Indeed, 80 far as the actual yield of the different grasses is
concerned, the two newer plots in the main approximated to the character of the
older one.
