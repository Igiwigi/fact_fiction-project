where tg = In(2)/y is the division time, /, is the total length of all ribosomal proteins in base pairs
as a cross-species average, Ip (bp) is the average length of all other cellular proteins, 7 = 63 (amino
acids s~!) [105] is the maximum base pair processing rate of the ribosome, 7 (s~!) and ¢ (s~!) are
specific degradation rates for ribosomes and proteins, respectively (both taken to be 6.20 x 10-5
[27]), u is the specific growth rate and Np is the total number of proteins (table 1).

In figure 1, the lines represent transformations (division by cell volume) of the best ordinary least
squares fits of metabolic rate against cell volume (compared with the RMA (reduced major axis) mea)
fits carried out in [25]). The large scatter in the data for unicellular eukaryotes is due to the fact fo
that the metabolic rate scaling is approximately linear with cell volume, and thus power density 24
is effectively just the residual values around this linear scaling relationship. DNS
For the translational efficiency in unicellular eukaryotes, we combined values for yeast, aon
and for multicellular eukaryotes, we used values for mammalian cells. The equations for [k
bacteria are general provided that we can accurately estimate the number of ribosomes and .
proteins, and the overall time to divide for a given cell volume. For yeast, we use a value
of N, = 1.87 x 10° [106], Np =5 x 10” [107] and a division time of tq = 7561.6 (s) [108]. For
mammalian cells, we use N; = 1.27 x 107 [109], Np = 1.70 x 10° [110] and a division time of tg =
1.71 x 10° (s) [111].
