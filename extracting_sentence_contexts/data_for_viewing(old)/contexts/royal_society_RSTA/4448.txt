Pure water permeance was determined from the variation of flux versus pressure (figure 4a)
for both membranes. A linear variation in flux with pressure is observed over the range of
pressure tested, with a permeance of 1.71m~?h7! bar~! for vacuum filtration membranes
and 7.91m~*h7! bar~! for CAS membranes determined from the gradient. Nair et al. [18]
compared their experimental results of water vapour flux through thin GO films to theoretical
flux estimations from the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. In doing so, they calculated the so-called
flow enhancement factor, which is defined as the ratio of the measured flux to the theoretical flux
calculated by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The flow enhancement factor has previously been
used to quantify flow enhancement in CNT membrane pores resulting from slip flow of water at
the hydrophobic CNT surface [34] and, more recently, has been adopted to describe anomalously
fast permeance by graphene-based membranes [6,11,18]. Acknowledging the fact that fluid flow
in these nano-capillaries may not conform to continuum mechanics, we similarly compare our
experimental results to the theoretical value. Following the procedure first employed by Nair et al.
[18] for GO/RGO membranes, the theoretical water permeance through RGO nano-channels can
be estimated by using the classical solution to the Navier-Stokes equation for viscous, laminar
volumetric flux through a channel comprising parallel plates (i.e. RGO sheets):
