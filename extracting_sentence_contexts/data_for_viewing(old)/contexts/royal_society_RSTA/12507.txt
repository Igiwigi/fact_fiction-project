The first of these terms is the interval from transit to the mean lunar L. W., which

precedes the H. W. given by (22), and the second is the interval after lunar L, W. to
the time ¢.

We shall proceed to consider H. W., and deduce therefrom the formule for L. W.

§ 5. Reduction of Longitudes of Moon and Sun to time of Fictitious Transit.

We have seen in (22) that the interval, from fictitious moon’s transit to the
time ¢, is

Now the equation of conservation of areas for the moon’s motion gives

but since c'/r§ = 1 + P, and since P is small, we have
