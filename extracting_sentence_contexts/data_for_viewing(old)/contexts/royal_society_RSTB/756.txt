highly magnified with strong transmitted light. Each of the vermiform
bodies is now seen to be a filament, or row of rods, enveloped by a thick
sheath, often corrugated. The average sizes are: length, 5 » to over 100 p;
breadth of sheath, 4°5 p to 5°5 w; breadth of enclosed rodlets, filaments, &c.,
about 05, or a little more. Though the Schizomycete is often, perhaps
mostly, in the axis of the sheath, this is by no means always the case, as the
specimens « and ¢ show. In b, the filament is escaping terminally from its
sheath ; in ¢ it is throwing off the sheath laterally. Treatment with iodine

Fig. 7. Time records of the growth of one of the filaments, in a hanging drop of old
ginger-gelatine. In this was placed traces of the Ginger-beer plant
(yeasts and bacteria) on December 29, 1890, and the behaviour of one of the
yeast-cells was traced up to the 31st of December. On that date I found
that several of the Schizomycete filaments were also growing, and an isolated
specimen was marked and its behaviour traced, with the following results—
a, the filament at 9 a.m., December 31 (temp. = 15° C.); b, the same at 3 P.M.,
and c, at 9 p.m, on the same date (temp. 15° C.); d shows the state of affairs
on January 1, 1891, at 11 a.m. (temp. 17° C.), and it is noticeable that a
considerable intercalary growth, as well as terminal, has occurred ; moreover,
