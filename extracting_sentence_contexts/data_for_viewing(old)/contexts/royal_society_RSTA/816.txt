growth. At intermediate and large undercoolings, dendritic-like structures are formed. The DN
intersection of the dendrites with the sample surface hint at fourfold symmetry, best seen for 23
germanium at intermediate undercooling. Also these observations are in agreement with the work : 3
by Nagashio & Kuribayashi [28]. They found on the quenched sample twin-free dendrites. EBSD
investigations indicate that the side branches of the dendrites also grow in the (111) direction as

the dendrite stem does.

At large undercoolings, the pictures show a solid-liquid boundary without any contours. In
particular, the dendritic morphologies disappeared. Nagashio & Kuribayashi [28] explained this
finding by the fragmentation of dendrites during recalescence. In fact, microstructures of samples
solidified at large undercoolings exhibit an equiaxed grain refined microstructure. Fragmentation
of dendrites by a Rayleigh type instability has been found in metallic systems [36]. Karma worked
out a model of dendrite fragmentation by a Rayleigh type instability that explains microstructural
double transitions from equiaxed grain refined to coarse-grained dendritic at a smaller critical
undercooling and from coarse-grained dendritic to equiaxed grain refined microstructure at a
higher critical undercooling in alloys [37].

MD simulations of Buta et al. confirmed that the steps are indeed rough and diffuse and that
the step kinetics is isotropic with linear kinetics [34]. It was shown that the steps have a two-
atomic-layer structure. The velocity normal to the {111} direction is much lower than the range of
step velocity found by the same computer experiments. Physically, this can be explained by some
significant ordering of the liquid setting on the terrace in front of the step, due to short-range
