«The disintegrating canses T have 8poken of have worn down the sedimentary strata
on either side of these dykes into a mere s0il, and you for the most part (as being the
moxst accessible way to get at them) dig the pieces of cherty ironstone out of a clay com-
poxed of the remains of these disintegrated rocks, and which in their downward sweep
by the torrents, haye been arrested on a flat or hollow halfway down the mountain, or
perhaps 1100 feet above the sea.”

These statements confirm the accounts of RixK and INGLEFIELD rTespecting the strati-
fication of the coal-deposits and plant-beds of Atanekerdluk (conf. Flora Toss. Arctica,
Pp. T). They show us that there is a considerable succession of sedimentary strata, pierced
by volcanic rocks which form the summits of the mountains. Fossil plants occur in all
the beds, but the siderite and limonite contain them in the greatest abundance and in
the best state of preservation. Tn fact the slabs from these beds are quite covered with
specimens, lying in every direction (7. c. p. 10).

Among the leaves I found two insects, a beetle and one of the Hemiptera. These
must have been inhabitants of dry land, as well as the plants. However, amongst the
latter we find several species which must have grown in marshy or moory ground, viz.
Phragmites, Sparganium, Taxodium, and Menyanthes. These plants indicate a fresh-
water formation, as does also a Cyclas (Plate LIT. fig. 10), the shell of which occurs in
the siderite, and which is undoubtedly a freshwater mollusk. These facts, combined
with the entire absence of marine plants and animals, prove to us that the siderite of
Atanekerdluk is most certainly a freshwater deposit—probably similar in its origin to
the limonite of onr own woods and marshes.
