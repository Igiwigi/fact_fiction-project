However, all three
have certain important points in common. They show a distribution, such that for
low energies the number within a given range dE = edV varies only slowly with E

(or V), whereas for high energies, 7.e., further to the right on each diagram, it falls off
very rapidly. Moreover, the shape of the rapidly falling part of the curve is much the
same in each case, and in fact on this part of the curves the ordinates are very nearly
proportional to e~*’, where « is a constant for any one curve. This can be seen if
the logarithms of the ordinates are plotted against V when the points fall very nearly
on a straight line. On the other hand, the slowly varying part of the curve shows
distinct indications of possessing a maximum in fig. 18, whereas in curves I. and II.
it falls away continuously from the initial value.
