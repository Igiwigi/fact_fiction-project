galvanometer will jump through 180%. Two pieces of silyer or of copper in s0lution
of sulphuret of potassium produce the same effect.

2037. If metals be used which are inactive in the fluids employed, and the latter
undergo no change during the time, from other circumstances, as heat, &c. (1838.
1937.), then no currents, and of course no such alterations in direction, are produced.

2038. Where no chemical action occurs no current is produced. —This in regard to
ordinary solid conductors, is well known to be the case, as with metals and other
bodies (1867.). It has also been shown to be true when fluid conductors (electrolytes)
are used, in every case where they exert no chemical action, though such different
substances as acid, alkalies and sulphurets have been employed (1843. 1858. 1825.
1829.). 'Phese are very striking facts.

2039. But'a current will occur the moment chemical action commences —This' pro-
position may be well illustrated by the following experiment. Make an arrangement
like that in fig. 14.; the two tubes being charged with the same pure, pale, strong nitric
acid, the two platinum wires p p being connected by a galyanometer, and the wire 7, of

iron. The apparatus is only another form of the simple arrangement fig. 15., where,
in imitation of a former experiment (889.), two plates of iron and platinum are placed
