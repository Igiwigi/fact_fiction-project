Given the
energetic demands of pregnancy and lactation, factors affecting energetic status
in mammals can arguably have a more significant effect on female relative to
male fitness [8]. Here, we focus on the energetic consequences of group-size variation in
female primates, emphasizing how group size affects resource competition
within and between groups. Primates are an ideal taxon within which to examine
this topic, given their remarkable diversity in social organization [9] and the fact
that individuals in the majority of primate species form enduring social bonds
with other group members [10]. For females in particular, the fitness advantages
associated with these social bonds—and group living more broadly—have long
been recognized (e.g. [11,12]), though a mechanistic understanding of how com-
petition affects survival and reproduction via energetic pathways has remained
elusive. Our overall objective is to guide future research on this topic by reviewing
