This is especially the
case at the four points 9, 9, 9, 9. It is obvious that these several points represent a cor-
responding number of incipient primary vascular wedges. Having ascertained these facts, I turned with some interest to the well-known stems
of the Bignoniacer, to ee how far the orientation of their lateral branches corresponded
with what T have just described. In these plants there is a distinct medulla, and the
lateral twigs are given off in pairs. When this is about to take place, two of the four
woody wedges constituting the Maltese cross exhibited by a transyerse section of the
stem become much broader than the other two, and a prolongation of the pith passes
outwards through the centre of each of these enlarged wedges, and carries along with it
an investing cylinder chiefly composed of sclerenchyma. 'Thus each branch springs
from the centre of a woody wedge, and not from its sides, as in my fossil plant.
