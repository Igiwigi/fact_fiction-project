In the thorax the sub-somitic mesoderm is large
(fig. 12) and as the limb buds develop, its more ventral part passes down into the hollow
of the appendage and gives rise to the intrinsic muscles of the limb. That part which
lies closely apposed to the ventral side of the somite gives rise to extrinsic muscles of
the leg and to the ventro-longitudinal muscles of the body wall (fig. 19). There has
been no attempt made to determine the precise fate of mesoderm in the limbs, beyond the
fact that muscle tissue is formed there. Two recognisable extrinsic muscles of the leg
arise over the median part of the leg rudiment. Mesoderm cells arrange themselves
in curved tracks, as seen in transverse section (fig. 19), and pass outwards from the inner
angle of the leg to the body wall immediately ventral to the somite.
