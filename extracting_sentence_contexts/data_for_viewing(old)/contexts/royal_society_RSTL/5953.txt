E the ingoing current which it serves to convey can consist only of sea-water.
S It is of great interest to inquire, What can be the purpose of this inflowing stream
= of the exterior sea-water ? Is it intended to replenish the fluid contained in the cavity
of the body? If so, this organ in Arenicola performs an office which is precisely the
reverse of that which devolves upon it in Nais and Lambricus. But it is certain that
the fluid thus introduced into the cavity of the organ (m) is driven out again, in whole
or in great part, by outwardly-acting cilia through the limb (6 B). That this second
or outgoing tube als0 opens externally (B*), can be distinctly seen by the eye (in young
specimens properly arranged for the examination). The water-current, therefore,
which is driven into the organ at the limb (A), is driven out again almost entirely
at the limb (B): none, if any part at all, penetrates into the cavity of the body.
Now there is no doubt upon the author's mind, although he has never been able
actually to demonstrate the fact, that this outgoing leg (5) of the looped organ (A, B)
not only communicates directly with the exterior, as at B*, but also, by means of a

lateral process (#), opens into the cavity of the body. It is by this last Process that
the ova in the female and the sperm-cells in the male reach the perigaztric chamber.
As far as the commencement of this lateral process, the generative products are con-
veyed by the cilia-excited water-current already explained; but how they are made
at this particular point to turn towards n, the opening leading into the perigastric
chamber, instead of escaping externally with the water-stream through B, can only be
