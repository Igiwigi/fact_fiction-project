differences were m —0038 D., and m' —0:033 D. After a few excitations these
diminished to —0*011 D. and —0:004 D.

The above observations, with the exception of the two last, were made for the
purpose of ascertaining the truth of Professxor MUxx's statement, that the external
surface of the lobe is negative to the under s8urface of the midrib. They tend to show
that the difference in question is one of frequent (perhaps constant) occurrence in
unexcited leaves, and that it diminishes in consequence of excitation.

We now proceed to the study of the second, and much more important, of the two

- 8tatements made in our previous paper relating to the electromotive properties of the
resting leaf. The fact that the external surface of the lobe is positive to the internal
gurface opposite to it, we propose to designate by the term * eross difference,” which
sufficiently expresses its own meaning. It will be remembered that the existence of
any 8uch difference is denied by Professxor MUNK, who holds that the opposite
surfaces of the lobe are isoelectrical.

In a preliminary series of observations made in the Laboratory of the Royal Gardens
at the same time with those already referred to no exceptions were met with. No
importance, however, could be attached to the bare fact of the negativity of the
internal surface unless it could be shown to be physiological in its nature—that is, not
a result, of the merely chemical or physical differences of the two opposite surfaces of
contact. The method which is employed for determining whether a phenomenon is
physiological or not, must always be the same. Tt consists in observing whether its
