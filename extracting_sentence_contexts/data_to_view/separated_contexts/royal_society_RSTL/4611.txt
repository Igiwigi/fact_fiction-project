HUXLEY ON THE ANATOMY OF SALPA AND PYROSOMA. 587

Separate structure, and the cavity in which the gemmiferous tube lies in all the Satpce,
and through which it makes its way to the exterior, seems to represent the normal
Separation of the test and tunics. The homology of the cellulose test of the Ascidian with the calcareous test of the
Mollusk has already been adverted to; and it would seem that, the separation of the
former from the tunics, or its confusion with it, is of as little. value as a character
among the Zunicata, as the imbedding of the shell in the mantle in Zimaz would be
in separating it from Zeliz, whose shell is distinct from the mantle.

62. It would appear, indeed, that in no natural family is it less possible to draw any
very broad line of demarcation among the various members than in the Tunicata.
< Tracing them one by one, we find that all the organs of the Salpe have their
Bomologues among the other Ascidians; the various genera passing one into the
hom by almost imperceptible gradations.
= Even the connection of the foetus with the parent by a placenta, a feature appa-

ntly so unique in the Salpw, seems to be not without its analogue in the Didem-
HideeÂ®,

Z The actual fact of a placental circulation indeed has not been observed, but it may
& surmised, as M. Mi1ixe-EpwarvsF has observed the ova to be developed within a
Hiverticulum of the vascular system of the parent.
2 The peculiarly formed heart, the circulation without distinct vessels, and the
$versal of its direction are common to all Tunicata.

and almost always to the right side.
