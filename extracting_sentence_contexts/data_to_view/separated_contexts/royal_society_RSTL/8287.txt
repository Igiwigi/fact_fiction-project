The enormous amount of rapid contraction at this period was, in the writer's opinion,
et by that deformation of the spheroid which hollowed out the ocean-bed to very
emuch the general outlines that we now see, and so assigned the general forms to the
gcontinents. S 'This cannot be viewed at present as much more than a conjecture; still it is one not
Swithout support both from authority and from facts. It seems impoxssible to assign any
Sother machinery or one adequate in force to a s0oulevement or subsidence 80 yast, extending
Gunbroken over such vast areas, and which should give to the sections of both land and
ocean-bed their actual forms, which (without regard to mountain and valley) are but
vast flat, raised-up plains, dipping more or less abruptly down to equally shallow, flat,
saucer-like plains of occan concayity. Lateral thrust or radial pressure at local centres
seems here equally inapplicable.
