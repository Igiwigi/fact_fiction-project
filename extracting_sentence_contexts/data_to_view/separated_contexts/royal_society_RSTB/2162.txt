Starch was plentifully stored in
the leaves of normal out-door plants, and in those grown under yellow glass ; it was
also fairly abundant under red glass ; very little was produced under blue glass ; and
none was found in leaves in poor light, under green glass, and under whitewashed
glass. This, of course, refers to accumulated starch, indicating an excess over that
used at the time. That starch is not formed in the submerged leaves of land-plants
which can be wetted, has been shown by NaGamatz.*

The fact that outgrowths were formed under whitewashed glass, while no starch
was found in the ieaves, is probably to be explained in the following way. When the
outgrowths were developed, the light, even under the whitewashed glass, was of very
considerable intensity, whereas, when the leaves were examined for starch at the close
of the experiments, the weather had for several days been cooler, and the sky almost
continually overcast, so that the amount of light was reduced. Comparing the distribution of starch with that of outgrowths, we find that, given
the necessary conditions of moisture, light, and heat, intumescences are formed when
starch is present and not when it is absent, except in the case of the plant grown
under whitewashed glass.
