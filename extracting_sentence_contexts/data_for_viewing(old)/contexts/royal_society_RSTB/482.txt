IV. Tue SHoOuLDER-GIRDLE.

In my former paper the shoulder-girdle is shown as a solid mass of cartilage in
Stages E-G, and in one specimen of H: in the other specimen of H the coracoid
region is fenestrated, and presents a distinct procoracoid, while from Stage I onwards
there is progressive degeneration of the procoracoid. Reference to the plates
will show that all the specimens showing a solid coracoid region belong to A. owent
(1, Plate 17, figs. 233, 234, 235, and 237), while those in which a poogasaoid is
present are all either A. australis or A.-bulleri.

The specimens upon which the present paper is founded are all examples of A.
australis, and they bring to light the remarkable fact that there are striking specific
differences in the development of the shoulder-girdle. Even in F’, which, as already
remarked, is only slightly more advanced than F of the former paper, there is a dis-
tinct coracoid fenestra, and the procoracoid is not formed of hyaline cartilage. This
point is still clearer in G’ (Plate 8, fig. 12), in which, except for the absence of ossifica-
tion, the shoulder-girdle has the characters which my former observations indicated
as being characteristic of the ripe embryo.

A re-examination of my sections of the embryo of A. australis, belonging to
Stage G, shows the same thing : there is a distinct procoracoid, very narrow, and not
formed of typical hyaline cartilage. I formerly overlooked this, my observations on
this stage being founded mainly on the dissected specimen of A. oweni, in which a
renewed examination shows no trace of a coracoid fenestra.
