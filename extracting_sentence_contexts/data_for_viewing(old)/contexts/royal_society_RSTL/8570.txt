fogs deadened sound very materially ; but the evidence was very contradictory on that
point. In a fog on land it was difficult to hear the passing of carriages or noises at a
short distance; and 80 in a fog at sea these signals found a difficulty in penetrating the
fog against which they are intended to be a protection.”

On the same occasion Mr, Jawts N. DovGLass, the Engineer of the Trinity House, to
whose ability as an obseryer I am able to bear strong testimony, stated that in his
experience © he had found but little difference in the travelling of sound in foggy or
in clear weather. THe had Aistinctly heard in a fog. at the Small's Rock in the Bristol
Channel, guns fired at Milford, twenty-five miles off.” Mr. BeazeLey had also heard
the Lundy-Island gun * at Hartland Point, a distance of ten miles, during dense fog ;”
s0 that, in winding up his paper, he admitted © that the subject appeared to be very little
known, and that the more it was looked into the more apparent became the fact that
the evidence as to the action of fog upon sound is extremely conflicting.”

In a paper presented to the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester on the
16th of December, 1873, Professor OsBorxE Revyxonns affirms the prevalent doctrine with
great distinctness, and makes a very ingenious attempt to explain it. © That sound,”
8ays Professor REYNOLDS, © does not readily penetrate a fog is a matter of common
observation. 'The bells and horns of ships are not heard so far during fogs as when the
weather is clear. In a London fog the noise of the wheels is much diminished, so that
they seem to be at a distance when really close by.”
