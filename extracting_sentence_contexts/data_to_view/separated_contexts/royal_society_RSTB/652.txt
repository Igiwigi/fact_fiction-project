As already mentioned, I have recognized three distinct modifications of the cup-
shaped elements. These three variations are illustrated by the three British species
having electric cups, viz., R. radiata, R. circularis, and R. fullonica. One of the
most interesting facts about the cups in these three species is that they seem to

represent three important stages in the evolution of the disc-like electrical elements
out of muscular fibres—the cups in I. radiata being at the best only modified
muscular fibres, while the cups in 2. fullonica approach, in many respects, the discs of
R. batis.
