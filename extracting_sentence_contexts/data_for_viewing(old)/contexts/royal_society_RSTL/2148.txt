wire $0 that they shall vibrate in the same time, I have in
vain made almost daily attempts to obtain a complete set of
observations. The observations however which I have given
are, I think, quite conclusive as to the fact of the compound
solar rays being possessed of magnetic properties.

As we can scarcely suppose that the terminal excess in the
case of the glass needle is due to magnetism in the glass,
deducting this portion from the terminal excess with the
other needles, the ratio of this excess with the magnetised
needle to that with the copper needle would be 17 to 1, a
result not very improbable, though the small difference in
this excess with the copper and glass needles may very pos-
Sibly have arisen from other causes. But if the effect with
the glass needle cannot be attributed to magnetic influence
any how exerted, what cause are we to assign for it? It is
