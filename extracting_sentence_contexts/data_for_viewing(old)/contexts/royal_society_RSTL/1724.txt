This must however depend on the relation of its mass to that
of the copper, and upon other circumstances not yet ascer-
tained (such as temperature, the relative saltness of the sea,



on the preservation of the copper sheathing of ships, &c. 245

and perhaps the rapidity of the motion of the ship ;) circum-
stances in relation to which I am about to make decisive
experiments.

Many singular facts have occurred in the course of these
researches. I shall mention some of them, that I have con-
firmed by repeated experiments, and which have connections
with general science.

Weak solutions of salt act strongly upon copper ; strong
ones, as brine, do not affect it ; and the reason seems to be,
that they contain little or no atmospheric air, the oxygene of
which seems necessary to give the electro-positive principle
of change to menstrua of this class.

I had anticipated the result of this experiment, and upon
the same principle of some others.
