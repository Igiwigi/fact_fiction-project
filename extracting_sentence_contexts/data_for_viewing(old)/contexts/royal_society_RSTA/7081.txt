The last two columns in table 1 give the values of W and v deduced from (22). For Hg
the frequency factor is of the order of the frequency of atomic vibrations, as we should expect;
in the other cases v is larger, due to the difference in rotational entropy between the crystal
and the vapour.

Coming back to the deviations from the linear law, we notice first that P, and C,,H,
follow the linear law to the lowest supersaturations observed. That means that Â¢, is smaller
than 10-3, and therefore, from (48), that x, >10*a. This is not surprising; in fact, the estimate
of x,/a made in I, equation (6), is valid for spherical molecules, for which the energy of
evaporation W; of an adsorbed molecule was assumed to be of the order of }W; in the case of
a flat molecule like C,)H,, we expect W; to be larger, and therefore x,/a will also be larger.

Figure 9 gives the results (logarithmic scale for both axes) obtained by Volmer & Schultze
on several I, crystals. The experimental rates of growth are not reproducible even for the
same face of the same crystal; this is not unexpected on the basis of the present theory.

Assuming that the rate of advance of steps is independent of orientation (x,>x)), one can
choose a value for 7, ~ 0-2 such that most of the experimental results are contained between
the rate of growth (47) of a single dislocation (continuous line in figure 9) and the linear
law (50) (broken line in figure 9). Taking 7, ~ 0-2 and y/kT'~4, we deduce from (48),
