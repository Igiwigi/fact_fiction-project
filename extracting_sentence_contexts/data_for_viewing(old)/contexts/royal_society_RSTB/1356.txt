than the level of the superior decussation, or decussation of the fillet; where
Marcu, of course, describes an extensive tract as degenerating in the anter
lateral region of the spinal cord down to the lumbar region. Even when me
allowance for the fact that Marcut had removed half of the middle lobe in additio
to the lateral, while I had only removed the lateral lobe of the cerebellum, it i
difficult to see how he could obtain so extensive a descending tract from a pi
cerebellar lesion. That the descending tract described by him was a result of som
accidental lesion, which complicated his operation on the cerebellum, seems possibl
for several reasons. Neither Ferrier and Turner nor I have been able to dete
any such tract after destruction of the cerebellum alone; Ferrer and Turner’
found a degenerated tract occupying this region of the cord after injury to Dx
nucleus, Morrt found a similar tract of fibres degenerating after injury, involvin;
the ground fibres and some of the cranial nuclei situated in the floor of the fourth
ventricle, and considers it very possible that these degenerated fibres come fron
Derrer’s nucleus ; but further suggests that they may also possibly be ground fibre
from motor cranial nuclei, particularly the ocular nuclei, and serving as bridges betwee
