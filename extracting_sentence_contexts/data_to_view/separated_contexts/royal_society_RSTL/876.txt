The interstices and cavities here mentioned, are those only which are formed
during melting and casting ; for the natural grain and texture peculiar to each metal,
cannot be changed by any of the methods employed to correct the irregularities which
have been accidentally introduced ; and it appears proper to remark, that without very
great caution, a new Source of error may arise from the reduction of brittle metals into
small fragments, or powder, which may conceal and retain little bubbles of air, s0
obstinately adherent to the metallic particles, as to require great patience and perse-
verance before they can be properly and completely disengaged,

which are neither sufficiently malleable to be rolled, nor suffi-
ciently brittle to be reduced into powder; and this last difficulty
most frequently occurs in mixed or alloyed metals. It is well known, that the specific gravity of an alloyed metal
is seldom that which, by calculating the respective specific
gravities and proportions of the different metals, would be the
result; on the contrary, the specific gravity of the alloyed mass,
is frequently greater or less than it ought to be, according to
calculation. This effect has been often noticed by various authors; and it
is not requisite that I should here repeat facts already 80 well
established ; I have, however, thought it proper to state, in the
following pages, the changes in specific gravity which took place,
when gold was alloyed with different proportions of various
metals. In the following experiments, I employed a very accurate
balance, which was made for me by Mr. Haas, and which,
when loaded with 1000 grains at each end, turned with ; 2- of
a grain.
