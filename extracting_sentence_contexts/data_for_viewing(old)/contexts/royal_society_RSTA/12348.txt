imestone are drilled at a height of about 100 metres by boring shells, whilst, at
, there is a raised beach, 16 to 20 feet above the sea-level, remarkable for the
sion of shells, and in places concreted into a hard mass. This beach is overlaid
a breccia composed of fragments of slate and limestone. The thickness of these
beds, which, from description of a section near Oran, would seem to correspond with
the Raised Beaches and “ Head” of our south coast, is not given.

Mr. Maw mentions, on the authority of Canon Tristram, that on the coast, to the -
est of Oran, there is a series of raised concreted sea-beaches, at heights of 200 to’
600 feet. From fragments found in one of these, at a height of 400 feet, Dr. Gwyn
Jmrrreys determined Pecten opercularis, Pectunculus glycimeris, Cardium edule,
Venus gallica, Turbo rugosus, and Fusus corneus, all common Mediterranean and
aternary species.{ Mr. Maw also remarks upon a fact he had noticed on the
ast-lines of Morocco, Corsica, and the Riviera, ‘that the hill- and valley-system of
he land shelves under the adjacent sea without the intervention of distinct escarp-
ments; indicating as he believes that the existing coast-level is so recent that the sea
as not yet had time to excavate a cliff-boundary.”§

Algeria.—tIn the important governmental work of scientific research in Algeria, M.
RENou|| gives a few interesting particulars of the Quaternary beds. He mentions
at there are several lines of sea-levels—one in particular, general all along the coast,
s marked by a horizontal belt 1 foot broad of holes drilled by boring shells, and
tbout 5 feet above the present sea-level. Another bed is composed of a gray clay full
of Cardiwm edule and other recent species, with a few fragments of pottery in places,
md is about 20 feet above sea-level. This bed is covered by a thickness of 150
