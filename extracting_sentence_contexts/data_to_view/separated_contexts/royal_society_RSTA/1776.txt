The English ‘civil claims procedure’ requires a complainant, a defendant and proof ona
balance of probabilities that the ‘injury’ complained of was caused by the action or inaction of the
defendant by reason of breach of a standard of care—a standard established and refined by the
judiciary over many decades on a case-by-case basis. This was thereby inevitably a standard that
was intrinsically susceptible to circumstance and prevailing norms. This reliance on an ‘after-
the-fact’ procedure, coupled with a requirement to establish a clear, legally recognizable causal


link between alleged cause and supposed effect, was to permeate the UK’s approach to what we
now term environmental regulation. The approach was one of future prevention of what could
be shown to have already been clearly unacceptable rather than a ‘precautionary approach’, the
latter now underpinning much of current thinking in relation to matters of the environment and
social well-being generally. A key step on the way to developing a UK legal framework for air pollution is the ‘The Law
of Nuisance’.
