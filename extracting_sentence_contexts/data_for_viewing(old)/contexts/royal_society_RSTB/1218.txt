after remoyal of surplus fluid, applied to the worm, such is the sensitiveness of
skin to certain chemical stimuli that the animal at once manifests signs of uneasine
The part to which the irritant has been applied becomes swollen up owing to
contraction of the circular muscles in front of and behind the point of irritation. 4A
the same time large quantities of milky coelomic fluid are poured out through th
dorsal pores. In this way the animal is provided with a good covering of s
matter. Dilute acids, alkalies, and other substances with irritant properties are
capable of producing the same results, and electrical stimuli induce the sam
phenomena.

Histology of the Slime.—That the slimy exudation is rich in cells is one of
important facts to be kept in mind, and the cells are those of the coelomic cavity.
They are all most actively ameeboid, having moving pseudopodia radiating from
almost every available point on the surface. But one can only see free wandering cells
if the fluid is collected as soon as it exudes from the dorsal pore and is immediately
examined. If the examination is delayed, great numbers of the cells are foun¢
to have already united to form plasmodia. The white frothy slime contains only
comparatively few free cells, the great mass of them having already formed plasmodi
around peculiar rope-like structures, which present irregular nodosities. To the naked
eye these colonies appear as minute opaque white specks. The slime becomes opaque
and turbid on the addition of dilute acetic acid, and on the addition of dilute caustie
potash the rope-like structures disappear, leaving air bubbles in the regions of the
nodosities. These appearances are due doubtless to the air in the grooves between
the somites becoming enveloped in a thin coating of mucous substance. In som
