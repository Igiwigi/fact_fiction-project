CLiyr, Mr. Cuer's confirmation of
them being published in the same volume of the Transactions. The circumstance of the brain and spinal marrow only, as we shall find, influencing
the heart under peculiar circumstances is probably the cause of the fact ascertained
by Haurzs, that it cannot be excited through its nerves in the same way as a muscle
of voluntary motion, an observation which applies to all muscles of involuntary mo-
tion, a want of attention to which has misled some physiologistsF. From the whole of the experiments which have been referred to, it appears, on the
one hand, that neither the brain nor spinal marrow bestows any power on the heart
or vessels ; but, on the other, that each of the former organs is equally capable of di-
rectly influencing both, (the vessels even to their utmost extremities) and that, not only
by exciting their powers, but also by impairing and even wholly destroying them, ac-
cording to the nature and power of the agent operating on the brain or spinal marrow z

although, in their usual functions, the heart and vessels, like the other muscles of
involuntary motion, obey neither of these organs, but agents peculiar to them-
selves*,

Thus it appeared that the ganglionie, like the cerebral and spinal nerves of motion,
may administer towards the contraction of the muscular fibre, unless, what I conceive
to be more probably the case although not yet ascertained, branches of the latter
nerves are bound up in the same sheath with the ganglionic nerves, as we shall find
there is reason to believe is the case with respect to the nerves of sensation.
