To that end, the amplitude
basins in the (F, t) parameter space for higher values of the F are depicted in figure 11a,b for 2 =1
and 2 = 2, respectively. The first frequency choice has been taken to carry on the previous section
analysis; the second one is related to figure 7d, where for a higher value of the forcing amplitude,
the higher-amplitude oscillations pop up for precisely 2 = 2. In fact, in that figure, for r = 4.5 and
for F > 2, the oscillations amplitude rises to A > 20. Thus, in figure 11, we can see how the light
blue amplitude basin reaches the interwell oscillations. We conclude that it is possible to enhance the oscillations confined to one well of Regions
II or V, so that they become interwell oscillations when the amplitude of the forcing increases.
