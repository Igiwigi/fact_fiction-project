whereas in curves I. and II.
it falls away continuously from the initial value. This disagreement at low energies
suggests trouble from the factors referred to above and points to the desirability of
keeping for the present to the high energy part of the curve in trying to find an inter-
pretation of the results. The outstanding feature of this part of the curve is the fact
that it falls away very approximately in proportion to the factor e~*â€™, which at once
suggests a Maxwell distribution of energy among the electrons, since this distribution
is dominated by a factor of this form. I have therefore calculated the currents which
would be obtained on the assumption that the energy of the electrons is a Maxwell
distribution pertaining to some, as yet undetermined, temperature T, and compared
the results of the calculations with the experimental data. For a small source surrounded by a large electrode the direction of motion is imma-
terial, and it is only the magnitude of the total kinetic energy which determines whether
the emitted electrons will reach the receiving electrode against a given retarding poten-
tial difference.
