There was, however, much more leguminous herbage,
especially in the later years, and chiefly Lathyrus protensts. There was also a larger,
but a decreasing, proportion belonging to other orders ; more Ranunculus, both acris
and bulbosus, more Conopodium denudatum, more Achillea millefolium, and more
Rumex acetosa, but much less Anthriscus than on 14. Tn fact, on plot 16, with the smaller amount of nitrate, a greater variety of grasses
contributed the bulk of the produce, but there was a less proportion of the more freely-
growing species. The herbage was made up in considerably less proportion of
Graminez, and it contained both a greater number of species, and a considerably
greater percentage by weight, of those belonging to the leguminous and other orders. As already mentioned, the average percentage of mineral matter in the dry sub-
stance is highest in the miscellaneous, lower in the leguminous, and lowest in the
gramineous herbage.
