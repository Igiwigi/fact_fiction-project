Re(0) =< (2.10)
The temperature 1/8 is chosen low enough such that the paramagnetic (7 = 0) state is metastable.
For J4>0 large enough the magnet may undergo a first-order phase transition from the
metastable state with m=0 to either of its stable ferromagnetic states, with magnetization up
or down, m—> +n. The transition will be triggered during the measurement process. The final
magnetization +Nmp can be read off, which is the registration of the measurement.

Now, the evolution of Dit) is dictated by the Liouville-von Neumann equation of motion,

dD
dt
The relevant degrees of freedom are those of the state of SM, i.e. the measured system and the
pointer. Hence, one is in fact interested in the evolution of the reduced state of SM,

ih— =[H,P]. (2.11)

Db) = trgP(b), (2.12)

where Dit) is the state of SMB. By tracing out the bath, one can obtain a dissipative equation
for the evolution of SM by using standard open systems techniques owing to the weak coupling
between M and B. One then obtains the following master equation for the evolution of SM under
its Hamiltonian Hp = Hs + Hu [5]:
