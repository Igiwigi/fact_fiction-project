Regarded as the ultimate
standard of atomic weight determinations, no error in the atomic weight enters—the
value of g is determined in terms of W = 107°88. Moreover its separation is large,
so that any error of measurement is a small fraction of its total value, and in addition
the actual error is extremely small. It is therefore tantalising to find that the lines,

D (2) excepted, are not susceptible of such exact measures as in many others, that
the typical series are not well developed, and that in fact there may be a doubt
whether the lines generally accepted as the P, 8, D series follow laws altogether
analogous to those in other groups. In Kayser and Runeer’s measures four lines are
assigned to D,, (2-5) and three to D, (2-4), the possible errors for D., being much less
