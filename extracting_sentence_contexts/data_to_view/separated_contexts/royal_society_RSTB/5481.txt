C. Brasn, we have been able to examine the
sections of the Thompson-Brash embryo. Although the preservation of this specimen
is not satisfactory, the following facts could be recognised. The head-process is in a
stage of development similar to that of the embryo Wal7 (Grosser). A median
epithelial chorda-process can be observed in the caudal region of the head-process,
accompanied by mesoderm on both sides.
