Anight have been dispensed with. Professor Ramsay now informs me that, although certain practical difficulties in
the working of his apparatus have not as yet been entirely overcome, he has already
determined (approximately) the comparative latent heats of evaporation of a con-
siderable number of volatile compounds, and that the results will shortly be
published. I venture, however, to call attention to the fact that the very perfection of
Professor RAMsAY’s method increases the importance of an accurate knowledge of the
absolute latent heat of evaporation of water. ]

Section VI.—Tue DererMINATION OF Sq. L will now describe the method of obtaining the value of the various terms in
Equation I. (p. 272) by which the quantity of heat supplied during an experiment is
ascertained.
