SNOW AND R. SNOW: EXPERIMENTS ON PHYLLOTAXIS. 37

fact that, in the Lupin at least, the centres of primordia do not arise in positions which
would not allow room for their stipules on each side. Moreover, ScHouTr’s assumptions,
apart from being inconsistent with the facts, are in any case unnecessary. With regard to the above working hypothesis, it must be pointed out that the
necessary minimum width and minimum distance from the growing-point must both be
relative to the size of the stem apex. For in Lupin buds in which the stem apex is
small, the primordia are proportionately small, and also less far below the growing-point.
