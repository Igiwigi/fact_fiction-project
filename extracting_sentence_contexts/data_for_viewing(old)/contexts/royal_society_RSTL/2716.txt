the temperature sinks in precisely the same proportion as the secretions are deranged.
A particular organ may be deranged by preventing its due supply of nervous influ-
ence, and there may be no general diminution of temperature. 'The due neryous in-
fluence is prevented reaching the particular organ, but there is no diminution of the
power of the brain or spinal marrow. When, on the other hand, the power of either
of these organs is impaired, there is an immediate diminution of temperature.

When the lower half of the spinal marrow was destroyed the animal shivered, and
would probably soon have died of cold if it had not been kept in a high temperature,
and eyen when the lumbar portion alone was destroyed, a considerable but less dimi-
nution of temperature ensued +.

Thus it appears, from the whole of the facts which have been referred to, that on
an influence derived from the brain and spinal marrow, and not from any part, bnt
from the whole of these organs, the secreting and more immediately assimilating
functions and the maintenance of animal temperature depend. This influence there-
fore performs a still more important part in the vital than in the sensitive functions.
In the latter we find it acting only a snbordinate part ; while in the former it must

be regarded as the great agent, to which all others employed are subservient.
