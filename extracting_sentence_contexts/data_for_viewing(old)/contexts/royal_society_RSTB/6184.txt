Here, too, the only well recorded direct experiment on the actual utricular macule,
that of Maxwett (1923), should be kept in mind. Having freely exposed, in the
dogfish, a utricular otolith from above, he gently displaced it, backwards, forwards
or laterally, with the help of a light pledget of cotton wool held in forceps. To
his surprise the effect of this displacement was exactly contrary to what might have
been predicted on the Kremu gravity hypothesis. For example, a forward displace-
ment of the otolith, instead of making the eyes roll upwards, caused them to roll
downwards, and so on.

It might be urged that the fact of two distinct modes of stimulation points to the
existence of two different mechanisms within the utricular receptors. Against this
idea the evidence, practically conclusive, is as follows. A bisoliutricular frog,
subjected to linear acceleration in a forward direction, begins by giving the same
gravity response as if it were being slowly tilted backwards. In other words, the
case is one of “ first mode” stimulation. By insensible gradation, however, the
response to successive increase of this acceleration passes eventually into the most
pronounced form of the irrelate reaction, which otherwise appears only in answer
to the “second mode ” of utricular stimulation. All other cases of response of the
bisoliutricular frog to steadily increasing degrees of linear acceleration show a
similar commingling of “ first mode” and “second mode” effects, in which the
one passes into the other without trace of discontinuity. The inevitable conclusion
is that the utricular process corresponding to “ first mode ” and to “ second mode ”’
