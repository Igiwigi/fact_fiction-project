phenotypes [29,129,130]. Moreover, group structure allows

migration, density-dependent survival and all other life-

groups given sufficient group integrity [131-135]. In fact, class s’ offspring produced by mutant individuals in a

an ESS for prosocial behaviour in a group structured popu-
lation by calculating invasion fitness will capture the effects
of both kin and group selection. To see this, we will outline
