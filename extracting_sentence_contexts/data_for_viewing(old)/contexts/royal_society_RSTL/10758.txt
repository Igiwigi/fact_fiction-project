MAGNETISATION ON THE THERMOELEOTRIC QUALITY OF IRON. 377

But 8nppose that no disturbance takes place, and let the process of loading be begun.
The observed effect is, first, a change towards positive, then 800n a positive maximum,
and then a great and continued change towards negative. Tt is open to conjecture
that the first (positive) effect, of loading is due to the mere molecular disturbance
as8ociated with change of stress ; that though the proper effect of loading is negative,
that effect lags, and superposed on it there is a positive effect due to the simple
disturbance cansed by loading, acting on the unstable molecular structure to which
the previous unloading has given rise. This view, were it tenable, would certainly
make the fact less extraordinary than it otherwise is, thab in.general a change from
loading to unloading, or vice vers, continues the same kind of thermoelectric change
as has been going on before.

But this view appears to be negatived by the experiment of fig. 31, and by similar
experiments made with mechanical shaking substituted for magnetic shaking. For we
find that at «, for instance, in spite of the violent molecular commotion which preceded
the loading, nevertheless the first effect of loading is to carry the wire through a
positive maximum of thermoelectric quality, before beginning that change towards
negative which is the main consequence of any moderately great load. And after
every other shaking up ab intermediate points in the loading the same curious positive
maximum comes in before the main trend of the © on” curve is resumed. Tb is clear
ihab this puzzling characteristic of the curves cannot be ascribed to any ordinary
