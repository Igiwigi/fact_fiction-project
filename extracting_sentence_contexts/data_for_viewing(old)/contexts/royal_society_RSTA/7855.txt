A minor point requires mention. If we derive the p.e. of the outer ring for case
u = 17 in Table V (in which s,, = 42-26 x 8-14 = 344 miles == 345 of (33.11)
the result is 0-0189 x (22)! = 0-089 ; and if we derive the same quantity from
(44.1) applied to ring between 15° and 20° we obtain 0-057 x (5:01)# = 0”- 127.
The discrepancy between the two is due to a mean value of ¢ having been used in
the former procedure.

DiscusstON OF PROBABLE ERRORS

45—With the additional local stations it is clear that the p.e. of Ar will be con-
siderably smaller than that estimated in § 38 for a simple world survey, viz., 34 feet.
In fact we must form the values of F,2/K’ (with K’ replacing K of Table IV), where
K’ is the enlarged number of stations. The result is a probable error of 23 feet
in Ar.

46—All the estimates of probable error are essentially based on the error of repre-
sentation, expressed by (29.5). This is in turn based on observational results from
a belt of 8° of latitude extending over 14° of longitude ; and it is subject to some
increase or decrease when data elsewhere are sufficient to admit of similar treatment.
It does not appear probable to the writer that any very serious change is likely to
be necessary, and if this view is correct, the derived probable errors may be accepted.

The probable error of Ar of 23 feet (§ 45), or approximately 10 * a, is smaller than
the probable error of a itself. No doubt the p.e. of a will be subject to considerable
