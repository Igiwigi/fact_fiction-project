3, A, represents a type encountered fairly commonly
at St. Andrews. Fixation has occurred and metamorphosis proceeded to much the
same extent as in the case D and E, but phagocytosis of the tail has not commenced. The tail, in fact, still exhibits twitching movements, though its tip shows signs of
degeneration. he reader is referred to a similar condition produced by hyper-alkalinity
in larvee of the Ascidiidae, described in Part I (BERRILL, 1929). Its significance in this
instance will be discussed later when the development of the remaining species of
Molgula has been described.
