thin and therefore black prominence,

We may turn now to the lines due to other substances. The wave-lengths were
determined by measuring the distance of the image of any prominence to the
corresponding image of one of the hydrogen lines. A first approximate result is
obtained by employing the ordinary interpolation formula which is based on the

supposition that differences in the refractive indices of two lines are proportional
to the differences of the inverse squares of the wave-length. Owing to different,
cireumstances, and amongst others to the fact thab the distances measured are
not quite proportional to differences of the refractive indices, we obtain in this way
approximate results only ; bub by taking a photograph of the solar spectram with the
same prisgm in the same position, we can easily determine the correction which
has to be applied in order to arrive at the mos satisfactory result. For instance,
the distance of one image was measured from the corresponding image of C and F, both
with a micrometer and directly with a finely divided scale. The interpolation formula,
gave 5889 by the firs6 method of measurement and 5893 by the second, the mean being
5891. This brings us near D, and if a similar calculation is made in the reference
spectrum, interpolating D between C and F, a wave-length 5907 is obtained. The
true wave-length being 5882, we 8ee that we have to apply a correction of â€”15 in
this part of the spectram. We thus find finally 5876 for the wave-length of the
unknown line, agreeing almost exactly with the wave-length (5875) of Dz. The
