from that which would he perceived by the right eye alone to that which would be
perceived by the left eye alone. At the moment of change the letter which has just
been seen breaks into fragments, while fragments of the letter which is about to ap-
pear mingle with them, and are immediately after replaced by the entire letter. It
does not appear to be in the power of the will to determine the appearance of either
of the letters, but the duration of the appearance seems to depend on causes which
are under our control: thus if the two pictures be equally illuminated, the alterna-
tions appear in general of equal duration; but if one picture be more illuminated than
the other, that which is less 80 will be perceived during a shorter time. TI have gene-
rally made this experiment with the apparatus, fig. 6. When complex pictures are
employed in the stereoscope, various parts of them alternate differently.

There are some facts intimately connected with the subject of the present article
which have already been frequently observed, Iallade to the experiments, first made
by Dv Tour, in which two different colours are presented to corresponding parts of
the two retinze. If a blue disc be presented to the right eye and a yellow disc to the
corresponding part of the left eye, instead of a green disc which would appear if these

two colours had mingled before their arrival at a single eye, the mind will perceive
the two colours distinetly one or the other alternately predominating either partially
or wholly over the disc. In the same manner the mind perceives no trace of violet
when red is presented to one eye and blue to the other, nor any vestige of orange
