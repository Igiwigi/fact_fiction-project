The equivalence between an LE and FP description
is at the heart of that development. Following the approach of Budini & Caceres, one of the present authors has shown in [29]
the importance of constructing joint-probability distribution functions (PDF) to represent non-
Markov stochastic processes compared to Markov cases. The joint probability distribution is
in fact necessary to construct the conditional probability distribution, which is the bona fide
representation of the random process. Following on from ref. [30], an FP representation for the
one-time and two-time PDF has been developed to construct the conditional PDF for a DLE [31]. Despite these recent findings for linear non-Markov systems, the formulation of an FP
description of nonlinear, non-Markov processes remains an open problem.
