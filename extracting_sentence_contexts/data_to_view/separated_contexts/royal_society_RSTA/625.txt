Hence, other optimization techniques can be applied to arrive at the best
results in terms of image resolution and computation time. One important optimization
would be to implement this algorithm in high-performance computing such as GPU. In addition to the fact that the level set approach does promise to make an ill-posed problem
better behaved, it offers other advantages such as the following:

— the level set method allows one to perform numerical computations of a geometrical
object containing curves and surfaces on a fixed Cartesian grid without the need to
parametrize such objects;


— the level set method has the ability to follow shapes with changing topology (i.e. split in
to multiregions, develops holes or vice versa);

— the level set method does not require any a priori assumptions about the topology (i.e.
spatial location) or the nature (i.e. shape and size) of the inclusion;

— the level set method is well suited for high-contrast image reconstruction with sharp
boundaries, because the high-contrast inclusion is incorporated explicitly in the level set
model without it dominating the entire region and overshadowing the other low-contrast
inclusions, unlike traditional regularization-based techniques, which have the limitation
of oversmoothing the reconstructed image especially when a high-contrast inclusion is
dominating the region. Because of such advantages, the level set method has a great potential for shape reconstruction i
applications and thus for multiphase image reconstruction. =

The results in this paper demonstrate the potential and feasibility of the proposed level set iw
technique for detecting, locating and characterizing all the different phases possibly appearing :
in a multiphase process.
