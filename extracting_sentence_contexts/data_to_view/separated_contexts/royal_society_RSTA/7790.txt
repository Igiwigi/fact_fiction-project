NITROCELLULOSE TN ACETONE-WATER MIXTURES. 273

applied without further assumptions to a colloid such as nitrocellulose where the
particles are very long and may be of varying shapes and sizes. For such reasons the question of total acetone solvation in aqueous acetone must
be approached rather by making the most reasonable inferences from as many facts
as possible, than by, rigid experimental proof. The experiments which have been
recorded here give only a relative measure of the acetone solvated, but the solvation
theory presented is made fairly probable by the fact that it does explain all the data
in a reasonable way, and is not in conflict with any known facts. Below the Compatibility Point—From acetone-water of less than the critical con-
centration acetone is absorbed by nitrocotton in amount increasing with the acetone
concentration. The nitrocotton swells and if the volume of the swollen mass is measured
as has been described it is found that much more solvent has been taken up than is
accounted for by determinations of apparent absorption carried out by any analytical
means.
