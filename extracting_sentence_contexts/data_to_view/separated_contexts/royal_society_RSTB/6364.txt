At another place, embedded among
the crowded fine tubes that may indicate nearness to the surface was a spore, the
wall of which was brownish-yellow, translucent, and seemed to have a tri-radiate-
marking (fig. 80). The fourth specimen, a piece of thin, black, wrinkled incrustation shown of natural
size in fig. 81, Plate 12, may be dealt with briefly. Its chief interest lies in its size
and isolation and in the fact that it gives some little idea of the form of a piece of
Nematothallus. It is over 6ยง cm. long by 1 cm. broad. Film-pulls and transfers of
the counterpart revealed a close tissue of fine tubes making up most of the
incrustation with, at places, indications of the cuticular pattern.
