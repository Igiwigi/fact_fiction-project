A. CARROLL ON THE VACUUM SPARK SPECTRA OF SOME OF

quantities agree. The important fact is that ~/I1s — +/2p is as constant as it turns out
to be. The discrepancy in thesequence Au I, etc., is of the same order; thus, Ts—V 2s ty fe
and the calculated value is 117. No change of » will here bring the results into coinci-
dence so that the effect of changing n in the Cu I sequence is probably accidental.

(ii) The outer levels.—When g levels can be used, it is found that the resulting f terms
are hydrogenic in magnitude, This justifies our method of calculating the terms by
assigning to the g level a value nearly corresponding to a hydrogen orbit of the same
quantum numbers in a simple Coulomb field (with the central charge of appropriate
magnitude).
