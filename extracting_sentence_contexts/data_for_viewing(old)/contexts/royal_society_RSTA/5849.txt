as to be asymptotically compatible with the observed homogeniety and isotropy. This reflects an
argument which we shall sketch that, under Einsteinian evolution, the summands making up M
(in a connected sum decomposition) that do support locally homogeneous and isotropic metrics
will tend to overwhelmingly dominate the spatial volume asymptotically as the universe model
continues to expand and furthermore that the actual evolving (inhomogeneous, non-isotropic)
metric on M will naturally tend to flow towards a homogeneous, isotropic one on each of these
asymptotically volume-dominating summands.

We do not claim that this mechanism is yet so compelling, either mathematically or
physically, as to convince one that the actual universe has a more exotic topology but
only that such a possibility is not strictly excluded by current observations. However, it
is intriguing to investigate the possibility that there may be a dynamical reason, provided
by Einstein’s equations, for the observed fact that the universe seems to be at least locally
homogeneous and isotropic and that this mechanism may therefore allow an attractive logical
alternative to simply extrapolating observations of necessarily limited scope to the universe as
a whole.

But what are the (compact, connected, orientable) 3-manifolds available for consideration?
This question has been profoundly clarified in recent years by the dramatic progress on lower-
dimensional topology made possible through the advancements in Ricci flow [4,5]. One now
knows for example that, since the Poincaré conjecture has finally been proven, any such
3-manifold M that is in fact simply connected must be diffeomorphic to the ordinary 3-sphere
S°. Setting aside this so-called ‘trivial’ manifold the remaining possibilities consist of an infinite
list of non-trivial manifolds, each of which is diffeomorphic (designated herein by ~) to a finite
connected sum of the following form:
