(9) Lawyer ignorance/deliberate manipulation. Lawyers and
courts do not understand science properly, and conse-
quently mishandle it and/or abuse it for their own
strategic ends.

(10) Communication failures. Experts are incapable of expres-
sing themselves (orally or in writing) in a manner
comprehensible to non-specialists.

(11) Lax (‘liberal’) admissibility standards. Courts too readily
admit questionable scientific evidence at trial, thus
exposing fact-finders to exaggerated risks of adjudica-
tive error.

(12) Excessively demanding (‘conservative’) admissibility standards.
Courts too readily exclude novel or unconventional expert
opinions, thus depriving fact-finders of information
relevant to their decision-making.

(13) Testimonial silencing. Trial procedures for eliciting oral
testimony prevent expert witnesses from communicat-
ing their evidence in their own language and on their
own terms.
