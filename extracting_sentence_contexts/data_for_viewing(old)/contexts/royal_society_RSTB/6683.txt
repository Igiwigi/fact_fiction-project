FLAsHMAN (1908), taking Ettior Smrru’s work as his basis for description, names
in §.5.R. the sulcus retrocalcarinus verticalis the sulcus occipitalis superior (cal-
carinus externus); and, naturally, then named a medial operculum the sulcus
lunatus, whereas it is in reality the superior polar sulcus. But, whereas Extior
SirH in his earlier writings may have left the impression that the sulcus lunatus is
variable in position to a considerable extent (in one case he states it was on the
medial surface of the hemisphere), there can be no ambiguity about his later views
on the matter: for in the Mott Memorial Volume he emphasizes the distinction
between the sulcus lunatus and the superior polar sulcus: ‘ Fig. 8 represents the
medial and lateral aspects respectively of the right hemisphere (the occipital part)
of a Bulgarian brain, in which at first sight there seemed to be two lunate sulci
upon the lateral aspect of the brain. But comparison with the other diagrams
reveals the fact that the upper lunate sulcus is really the superior polar sulcus which
has been displaced on to the lateral surface while the inferior polar sulcus remains
on the medial surface ”’.

The presence of a medial operculation, probably indistinguishable from the
superior polar sulcus, in so many of the Australian brains has made this digression
necessary ; and it will avoid needless repetition to define the viewpoint held by me
on the identity of the various fissures. The so-called ‘“ Affenspalte ” is the fissure
bounding the posterior lip of the occipital operculum. The occipital operculum
is, however, so variable in its extent that the cleft can hardly be said to be homo-
logous with any other particular cleft unless the opercula in the compared specimens
are of approximately equal size and form. In the two Australian hemispheres the
type of operculum is almost comparable with that seen in the Cercopithecidae and
