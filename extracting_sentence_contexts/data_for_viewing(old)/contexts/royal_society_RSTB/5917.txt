The background response.—Preliminary tests convinced us that chameleons respond
to background in the usual manner. On a white background they are light coloured,
on a black background they are dark. It seemed advisable, however, in view of the
complexity of the dermal pattern and the many colours involved, to attempt a more
exact method of recording than is possible with the use of the adjectives “ pale” and
“dark.” Accordingly, colorimetric scales of appropriate shades were adopted for
each region of the dermal pattern, and the “bands,” “islands,” “ margin,” and
“back” were separately recorded. The records showed that in general the whole
dermal pattern became uniformly paler or darker. Because of this fact, and also
because individual variability in the “ bands,” “islands,” and ‘‘ margin” made it
difficult to fit a large number of animals into the colorimetric scheme, this complicated
method of recording was ultimately abandoned in favour of the simpler one of recording
the colour of the “back” only. For this purpose we have adopted the procedure
devised by HocBen for recording the melanophores of Amphibia, and have assigned
numerical symbols to five stages of progressive darkening of the “ back” region of
the skin. The scale employed was the following :—
