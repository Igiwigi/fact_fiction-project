Mr, ANDERSON seems to have never met the Caribs of the north end of the
island, and relied principally on the planters, who had not long been settled in that
quarter, as it was considered a reserve for the natives. His porters were negro slaves.
He may never have heard of the eruption of 1718, or if he did so, may have
considered the evidence for it unsatisfactory.

The anonymous writer of the account of the eruption of 1812 distinctly refers to
a previous eruption in the words, “ A century had now elapsed since the last convul-
sion of the mountain ” (see p. 463).

The internal evidence, also, is very strongly in favour of Derror’s narrative
having been founded on fact. The first news to reach England was that in Barbados
the startling phenomenon of a rain of ashes had caused great alarm, and it had been
preceded by sounds like distant cannonading. Similar noises were heard all over the
Caribbean Sea from Antigua to Trinidad, The rain of dust had been heaviest near
St. Vincent and in Barbados. Around the Soufriére the inhabitants had for a month
previously been terrified by the frequency of the earthquakes. Then the mountain
burst with a tremendous noise, hot stones and sand rained down for hours, and there
was complete darkness. Those who were in ships off the island saw a flash of fire,
followed by loud crashing noises. The eruption was sudden in its outburst, and
lasted only for a day or two.

These are, in fact, the distinctive features of the eruptions of 1812 and 1902, as
observed by those at some distance from the voleano, and the whole account resembles
