These
contain as a rule achromatic combinations of carefully figured lenses which have been
adjusted in relative position with the utmost precision. The design of the eye appears
rudimentary in comparison with such lenses, yet practical tests with grating and other test
objects show that this elementary lens system, possessing apparently no chromatic correc-
tion of any kind, and certainly no fluorite-like medium which could impart an apochro-
matic correction, behaves in an almost flawless manner. So good, in fact, is the apparent
definition of the foveal image, that if the lens system of the eye could be removed and an
apochromatic lens, selected for its good performance, could be substituted, it is doubtful
if the possessor of this eye would detect any improvement in his perception of fine detail. What he would certainly notice would be a very serious deterioration at the periphery of
his visual fields. His original eye lens gave him an angle of view exceeding a right angle
(Hartridge 1919).
