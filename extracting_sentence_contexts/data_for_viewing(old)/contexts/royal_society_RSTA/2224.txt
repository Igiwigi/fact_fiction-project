unit-sphere has the following integrals of motion:

expressing, respectively, the conservation of angular momentum and linear momentum
in the space. Notice that the integral of motion L simplifies to L= yy Tj, and it is
therefore redundant, while Pz = rea pk. Then, the moment of vorticity vector

P= (Px, Py, Pz), (3.3)

plays a special role in characterizing the dynamics of the vortex system. In fact, whenever
P £0, we use the freedom in the axes orientation to select the reference system with the
z-axis in the direction of P. This choice gives Py = Py=0.

(2) Polar vortices not fixed at the poles. When considering configurations with some vortices
near the poles, it is more appropriate to use the following canonical coordinates for the


‘polar’ vortices:

Unp = 4/2(1 — Znp) COS Gnp,  Unp = Inpy/2(1 — Znp) SiN Ynp,
Usp =4/2(1 + Zsp) COS Psp, Usp = Isp, 2(1 + Zsp) SiN Ysp,
P P. P. p =! sp P. P
