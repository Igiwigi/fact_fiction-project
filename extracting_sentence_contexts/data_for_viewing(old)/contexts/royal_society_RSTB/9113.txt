should be expected for first-generation hybrids between
wild and domestic S. scrofa, but not necessarily in the case
of continuous admixture between domestic pigs and local
wild boar.

In the data presented here, the molars of the group 2L
pigs that possess domestic tooth shapes are slightly smaller
than those with a wild shape, suggesting that, in addition
to altering their shape signatures, the process of becoming
domestic (either independently or via admixture with intro-
duced domestic populations) also influenced their size. If
the earliest group 2L pigs with domestic tooth shape are in
fact wild-domestic hybrids, they are probably not first-gener-
ation crosses, but more likely the result of multiple instances
of (and perhaps even regular) introgression. However, we
cannot exclude the possibility that these pigs were the
result of an independent process that did not involve admix-
ture with imported pigs, and future analyses of the nuclear
genome should differentiate between these two scenarios.

(b) Evidence for the tempo of phenotypic changes
during domestication

Early animal domestication was most likely a multi-genera-
tional, progressive process. As a result, intermediate forms
