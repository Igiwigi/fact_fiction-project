One approach to improve the integration of non-ceramic implants such as the
itanium alloys used in femoral stems is to coat the metal with a ceramic [12]. Although alumina has been used, HAp is a preferred contender because it is
ioactive and thus will bond to the surrounding bone. In fact, for many years
13,14] it was considered that the precipitation of such an HAp layer on an implant
was a key indicator of bioactivity, or bone-bonding ability. This position is now
oeing challenged [15], since some crystalline calcium phosphates (e.g. B-TCP)
90nd to bone without the formation of an HAp layer.
