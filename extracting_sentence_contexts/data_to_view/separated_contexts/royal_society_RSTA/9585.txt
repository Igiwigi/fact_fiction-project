After a further anneal at 308° this alloy was two-phase
throughout the whole of its cross-section. The experimental results are plotted in fig. 19, and it will be seen that the maximum
solid solubility is slightly less than that of the typical trivalent systems copper-aluminium,
silver-aluminium, copper-gallium, and silver-indium. This difference is probably due
chiefly to the fact that the atomic diameter of gallium lies just outside the zone of favour-

been exhaustively reviewed by Baver and Hansen.{ The solidus alone does not.
seem to have been determined conclusively, and we have therefore determined a few
points by the quenching method in order to make sure of the position of this line.
