Figure 7. Time-series example illustrating how the heave motion (77;) excites the piston-mode motion, and later how the
heave motion is reduced as a consequence of the piston-mode motion inside the moonpool gap by means of a semi-nonlinear
simulation, with wave period T = 0.8 s and 4 wave steepness. Cer, space-averaged wave elevation inside the moonpool in the
Earth-fixed coordinate system. (Online version in colour.)

We note the significant difference between semi-nonlinear and nonlinear hybrid methods
around roll resonance. The differences between semi-nonlinear and nonlinear hybrid methods are
not as large at heave resonance. The latter facts are consistent with the numerically predicted roll
damping and heave damping at resonance (figure 8) as functions of roll and heave amplitude,
respectively. For example, in the semi-nonlinear simulation with wave steepness ay the roll
amplitude is 7.6° at roll resonance and the heave amplitude is 4.5mm at the heave resonance;
in the nonlinear simulation, the roll amplitude is 4.9° at roll resonance and the heave amplitude
is 3.9mm at the heave resonance.

The roll damping coefficient in figure 8 is obtained by calculating the damping moment about
the COG (180° out of phase with the roll angular velocity) due to forced roll about the COG by
both hybrid methods. The corresponding linear roll damping coefficient Byy has been calculated.
The simulations are performed for forced roll oscillation with different roll amplitudes (figure 82).
Three separate results from the nonlinear hybrid method are given, where the results are for the
three different meshes used for the three different wave steepnesses. The roll resonance period
