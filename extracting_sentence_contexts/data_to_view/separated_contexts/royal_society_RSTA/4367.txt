It is to be observed that the intermediary integral or integrals thus obtained
cannot be regarded as intermediary integrals of the original equation in the ordinary
sense of the phrase, for each of them involves two arbitrary functions. But they
are intermediary for the respective compatible equations: each of them involves one
arbitrary function more than occurs in the compatible equation. The result mani-
festly does not imply that the original equation possesses any intermediary integral ;
in fact, the assumption throughout our investigations has been that no proper
intermediary integral exists. 25. A methodt has been given elsewhere for constructing the intermediary integral.
