I have calculated by this method several other particular cases, which are given in

my * Second Memoir upon Quantics;” the present researches were in fact made for

the sake of their application to that theory.

Since the preceding portions of the present Memoir were written, Mr. SYLVESTER
has communicated to me a remarkable theorem which has led me to the following

additional investigations*.

Let [5 be a rational fraction, and let (y—z;)* be a factor of the denominator Fn,
