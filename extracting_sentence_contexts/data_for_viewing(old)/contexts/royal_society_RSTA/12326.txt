* Asa matter of curiosity I think it might be interesting in a time of comparative leisure for some
person to make experiments with a spirit lamp or other heater kept revolving slowly round in a cireular
path under a circular tray filled with water, the path being of a little smaller radius than the tray. The


GRAND CURRENTS OF ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION. 659

The theory or speculation in the terms in which it was set forth by its author
makes no reference to the inertial conditions of the atmosphere concerned in its
diurnal revolution along with the Earth, to which, as a matter of fact, it clings so as
to have at all times and all places almost the same revolutional speed or angular
velocity of diurnal rotation as the Earth has. In fact, Hatiny’s theory would be
equally applicable to the case of the world being non-rotative and having the Sun,
_ ~oran equivalent source of heat, revolving round it from east to west.

But, in view of the very powerfully influencing conditions subsequently brought to
light in the theory of Haptey which will next be adduced, any such feeble causes as
x those relied on by Hatiey must fall practically into insignificance, the indubitable
& cause shown in Hapiey’s theory being such as to be dominant.
3 In 1735 Grorce Haptey (brother of the Jon Hapiey who invented the instru-
'§ ment commonly known as Hapiey’s Quadrant) submitted to the Royal Society the
& paper of which I have made mention already as supplying for the first time a substantially
‘© true theory of the primarily dominant conditions of atmospheric circulation.* The
& paper is entitled “ Concerning the Cause of the General Trade-Winds,” and it is right
