showing minimal variation in peak position over a three-month period.

graphitic particles are ‘bolder-like’ in form with smooth unbroken surfaces.

SEM images of the as-received anode reveal ellipsoid ‘bolder-like’ graphitic particles with a
diameter of approximately 15-25 um (figure 10). The general observation was that in the case of
the vacuum oven, the anodes maintained their structure for the duration of storage whereas those
in standard atmosphere developed fissures on the surface of the anode. The dry room samples
also displayed some signs of surface cracking after eight weeks of storage (figure 11). There is
a trend therefore for an increased propensity to form these fissures, or particle pulverization,
more rapidly the ‘wetter’ the storage condition. The fact that the surface morphology has been
physically altered also suggests that the process is irreversible and so a heat treatment prior to
cell assembly may not restore the electrodes original properties, although not reported here in
this study.

Similar to the cathode XPS analysis, the ‘as-received’ electrodes as well as samples from
the different storage environments were analysed after nine weeks of storage for the anodes.
These mostly comprise carbon from the graphite that makes up most of the anode surface. The
peak positions as well as the calculated percentages for the different constituent components
for the identified peaks are displayed in table 2, which shows that the oxygen content is lower
in the vacuum oven (approx. 14.4%) when compared with the dry room (approx. 15.5%) or the
laboratory (approx. 15.9%). These results indicate more absorbed species in the samples stored in
air. The proportion of the surface species are very similar between the different storage conditions.
