In order to ascertain the cooling effect due to pure carbonic acid, we may at
present neglect the effect due to the small quantity of watery vapour contained by
the gas; and as the cooling effects observed in the yarious mixtures of atmospheric
air and carbonic acid appear nearly consistent with the hypothesis that the specific
heats of the two elastic fluids are for equal volumes equal to one another, and that
each fluid experiences in the mixture the same ahsolute thermo-dynamic effect as if
the other were removed, we may for the present take the following estimate of the
cooling effects due to pure carbonic acid, at the various temperatures and pressures
employed, calculated by means of this hypothesis from the observations in which
the per-centage of carbonic acid was the greatest, and in fact 80 great, that a con-
siderable error in the correction for the common air would scarcely affect the result
to any sensible extent.
