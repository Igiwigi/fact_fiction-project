We will also briefly : s
discuss the industry’s and regulators’s response which, in some instances, does not necessarily 73

follow an entirely different path from the one which led to the accident.

2. Tsunami setting

Tsunamis have been known and described by chroniclers in Japan for centuries. In fact, the term
has largely replaced the English term ‘tidal wave’ to eliminate any confusion with tides, much as
the latter is not entirely inappropriate, given that most tsunamis along open coastlines resemble
fast receding or ebbing tides. The geological setting of Japan is well known. Here, we will discuss
a few large tsunamis that have hit North East Japan (figure 1 and table 1), in chronological order,
events which were known in the literature and ought to have been known to regulators, scientists
and engineers involved in the safety assessments of Japanese NPPs.
