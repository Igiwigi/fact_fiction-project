The maximum relative velocity at
the boundary of the inner and outer parts of the core will then be 0-055 cm./sec. The argu-
ments of II (p. 444) would give the corresponding radial velocity as 3-4 x 10~4cm./sec. This may be somewhat underestimated as it is computed on the assumption that angular
momentum must be conserved in the radial motion of every particle, in fact the electro-
magnetic forces tend to restore a rigid body rotation and thus increase the radial velocity
necessary to produce a given differential rotation. The maximum toroidal field is shown in III to be

$n (wy —0,) BH (1—B5/a°),

where H, is the field at r = 6 (either uniform or dipole). The above value of w,—w, gives
150 gauss for the toroidal field if« = 3 x 10~®, H, = 4 gauss and the core is divided into two
equal parts.
