Spitzer proved this by solving the Kolmogorov backward
equation in a wedge region, then taking the limit of
infinite wedge angle. A key feature of Spitzer’s Law is
that the winding angle has infinite variance, which is due
to the roughness of the Brownian trajectory generating
large winding near the origin [2]. In fact, all positive

integer moments diverge. This divergence is undesirable when modelling physical problems,
such as flexible polymers, and there are several ways to regularize it.

Instead of a continuous process such as Brownian motion, let R(1) be a random walk on a
square lattice of R? that avoids the origin, with iid. steps AR. Bélisle [3] showed that if AR is
bounded or absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure, then the winding angle
