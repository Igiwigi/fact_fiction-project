experimental facts cited as the causes for it, yet that I draw
a different conclusion from his, because, instructed by my
experiments on the nature of the triple prussiates, I find that
all those inconvenient effects are easily prevented from ensu-
ing ; and I therefore conclude that the ferruretted chyazate
of potash is in general the most appropriate test of the quan-
tity of iron in solution of any employed in chemistry ; the use
of it for this purpose only requiring attention to the following
facts,

18t. That if the ferruretted chyazate of potash after being
dissolved in water gives immediately a blue precipitate by the
addition of muriatic acid, it is not pure, and will give a falla-
cious result. 2dly. That if this salt, however pure, be added 77 excess to
a Solution of iron containing an excess of acid, and then heated,
the Prussian blue thrown down will weigh more than it ought, '
because some is furnished by the decomposition of the ferru-
ginous acid of that part of the salt which has been added in
eXCcess.
