These expressions must be identical. ‘To determine the two unknowns (f;. f2) we have
no further information beyond the fact that f, (p) and f, (¢) are particular cases of two
solutions of LapLacn’s equation with z equated to zero—-and usually a known type of
behaviour of ¢ at infinity.
The mere identity of the two expressions could be secured by taking
