Several approaches aimed at combining adequate
mechanical properties and internal structures have been studied, including the use of inorganic
nanomaterials in combination with polymers to strengthen the network without reducing the
porosity [6-8]. Although, as discussed above, the mechanical strength and degree of porosity of hydrogels
intended for applications in tissue engineering are very important factors, not less relevant is
their anisotropy, which is an aspect that is usually disregarded in most studies. In fact, most
hydrogels are synthesized by homogeneous assembly of building blocks, resulting in isotropic
networks, in contrast with most biological systems, such as muscle tissue [9,10], skin tissue [11,12]
or cartilage tissue [13,14], which present well-defined hierarchical, anisotropic structures. In these
tissues, anisotropy plays an essential role, making possible particular processes such as mass
transfer, surface lubrication and force generation. As an example, muscle contraction results from
the anisotropic disposition of actin-myosin within the sarcomere [9,10].
