The first term on the right-hand side corresponds to relaxation to a density-
dependent optimal velocity given by the decreasing function V(p) with a
relaxation time T. The limit T— 0 suggests a connection with equation (3.3).
Note that this idea also appears in microscopic models as explained further below.
The second term is such that MN’ =0 for constant density and velocity, in which
case equation (3.3) still holds. This term may be constructed using fluid dynamical
analogies and usually contains a ‘pressure term’ that is proportional to —0,p/p
and represents anticipation of drivers to events ahead, and a ‘diffusion term’ that
is proportional to v,, and represents the averaged effects of noise (Payne 1979;
Kerner & Konhauser 1994).

Despite the fact that pressure and diffusion are abstractions that are difficult to
interpret in traffic, these models are able to reproduce uniform flow as well as stop-
and-go waves (without discontinuities). However, they have been criticized for
predicting non-physical flow motions (negative flux and negative velocities) under
certain conditions (Daganzo 1995). In response to this criticism N = pP’(p)d,v
has been proposed by Aw & Rascle (2000), where the function P(p) represents
anticipation. Moving N to the left-hand side and using equation (3.1), model
(3.5) can be rewritten as

di(v + P(p)) + v94(v-+ Plp)) = a (P(0) ~ 2). (3.6)
Here v+ P(p) represents a Lagrangian quantity and the model is claimed to
properly describe the anisotropy of traffic flow: particles respond to stimuli from
the front but not from the back. Notice that model (3.1), (3.6) is a hyperbolic
