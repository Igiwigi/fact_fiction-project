had it all been converted into a salt of the formula AgF, HF the weight would have been
43:54 grains. The heated boat and its contents had lost only -08 grain; the residue
consisted of unaltered fluoride, aud showed no signs of free silver as it would have done

if any moisture had been present. No special corrosion of any of the yessels occurred,
From these results, supported by other reasons, I consider that a double fluoride of
hydrogen and silyer exists, similar to the corresponding salt of hydrogen and potassium,
but more easily decomposable by heat. The non-reduction of any of the heated salt to
metal affords further confirmation of the fact that the liquid expelled by heat from the
acid fluoride of potassium is quite free from water (se Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc. 1869,
Pp: 184 & 185).

With Chlorine.â€”Several investigators have subjected argentic fluoride to the action of
chlorine. A1E* passed chlorine over the salt at 60* Fahr. Sir H. Davy+ heated per-
fectly dry fluoride of silver in a glass vessel filled with chlorine; the salt was converted

into chloride, the retort was violently corroded, much chlorine was absorbed, fluoride of b
8ilicon and free oxygen was produced, but no new gas was discovered. :
The brown fluoride, in the proportion of 6 grains to each ounce of chlorine, was by

exposed to the sun's rays in a bottle full of that gas in the dry tate; the yellow colour
