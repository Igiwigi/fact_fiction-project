the © embryonic cartilage” had largely become © hyaline ;” that
the foundations of the cranium were laid, and the visceral arches were differentiated
and becoming quite solid. Here, it would seem, that in 80 small a larva of 80 large
a Fish—and that Fish lying at the base of the greab archaic group of the Ganoids—we
have a good chance of seeing the primordial vertebrate skull in its utmost simplicity. The fact is, that we have a confusingly simple state of things. In the fore part of the spine, as well as in the whole basi-cranial region, the
paired skeletal tracts that lie right and left of the mesoblastic sheath of the notochord,
the hardening cartilage shows no signs of segmentation or intercalary vertebral 8ub-
division ; this is just like what occurs in the Selachians (Trans. Zool. Soc., vol. x.,
plate 35).
