With regard to phase, it will be observed that there are eight cases of accelerated
tide to four of retarded. Two of the retarded tides refer to Hartlepool, and concerning
this station Sir W. TromsoN says in the report : © There is scarcely sufficient agree-
ment between the results deduced from the long-period tides to be satisfactory,
although the quantities of some are within reasonable limits,”

It may be remarked, in passing, that Cat Island gives a retarded tide, and Toulon an
accelerated one,

If we treat these alterations of phase in the same way as R' was treated, we find a
mean acceleration of phase of 785, but with a p.e. several times larger than the
result itself. But, in fact, with 80 few and such irregular observations the method
of least squares is useless. The cases of retarded phase certainly show considerably more irregularity than
those of accelerated phase. If we take the mean of the cases with accelerated phase,
we $hall find an acceleration of 48*, which corresponds in time to an acceleration
of 1 day 20 hours,

Now three out of four years of observations show an accelerated tide at Liverpool ;
all three years show an acceleration at Kurrachee ; the Hartlepool observations are
not of yery much value ; while the single year of acceleration at Brest may be et off
against the single year of retardation at Ramsgate.
