This Swift-Hohenberg equation captures the behaviour
of the system in the vicinity of dm = 2, a codimension-two singularity that serves as an organizing
centre for the formation of a large variety of complex LSs [53,54]. Moreover, these structures
are expected to persist as |dm â€” 2| increases, and so may potentially provide insight for other
ecologically relevant parameter regimes. In fact, the appearance of a quadruple zero bifurcation
is by no means unique to the GS model or for that matter to other vegetation models, but is
a property of reaction-diffusion systems in general. For example, this bifurcation organizes the
properties of both bright and dark solitons within the Lugiato-Lefever equation used to model
nonlinear optical systems [42]. Data accessibility.
