In group (b) reflex action in the cord is not increased, nor does it appear to be very
much diminished till the last. In this group, however, the higher centres appear to be
paralyzed. We infer this from the fact that yttrium greatly diminishes co-ordinating
power in the Frog, rendering the movements ataxic, and causing the animal to lie with
the legs fully stretched out, although neither musele or nerve is paralyzed. Didy-
mium, erbium, and lanthanum all have a similar action. In regard to their action on motor nerves, we notice the same well marked division
into two groups as in their general action : beryllium, calcium, strontium, and barium
all paralyzing the motor nerves to some extent.
