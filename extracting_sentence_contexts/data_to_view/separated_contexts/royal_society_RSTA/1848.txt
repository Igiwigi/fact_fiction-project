It alters the coefficient B, of B so as to make the two
leading terms agree with (69). It also alters E in such a way as to remove the term
in M® and reduce E to a quintic. In fact it gives for the new E the remainder obtained
after the first step in the division of E by A, according to the usual process. In practice, the terms in (E,/A,) M’ are very readily added as follows :-—

At, +Ex,'/(1—E,M%,/A,)
1+Be2/(1—E,M%2/A,) Aa, = nf

and this amounts to applying the same corrective factor 1/(1—E,M%t,"/A,) or
1/(1—En,*t,?/n2A,) to the second terms in both numerator and denominator.
