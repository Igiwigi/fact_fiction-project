‘3 Hence the supporting frame can be left in operation up to the last moment, and when
@ the beam is eventually released it remains practically horizontal during the bending

% There is one occasion, however, when the beam should be lowered by about a

© blocks. In the form of apparatus now described this movement is practically nil,
& but it is well to have a means of confirming the fact by a direct determination. In
& Kocu’s apparatus it amounts to as much as the equivalent to two interference bands,
g as the second reflecting surface is not supported by the blocks, but independently. © For this purpose instead of a plate a block of glass, 1 centim.
