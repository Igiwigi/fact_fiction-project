of the plant from Burntisland to which I gave the name of Lepidodendron brevi-
folium. All subsequent experience of these beds, at Petticur, confirm my conviction
that we have only found in them one species of Lepidodendron, and that the very
youngest twigs and the matured branches, with all their specialized intermediate
conditions, merely represent various stages of the growth of the same plant. If, as
I believe, this is the case, we cannot hesitate to identify with it the numerous
macrospores and the heterosporous Lepidostroli that I found associated with the
vegetative organs, and which I described in the same Memoir. In Plate 44, fig. 28, I
represented four sporangia containing unmistakable macrospores, which I found at
the base of a Lepidostrobus, the remaining sporangia of which were filled with
microspores. Though so fragmentary as regards size, the specimen sufficed to establish
the fact that the Lepidodendron brevifolium was a heterosporous form. At a later
period Mr. CarrRuTHERS was fortunate enough to obtain a section from the same
locality, containing two superb Lepidostrobi ; these he has kindly allowed me to figure.
Each of the two figures, 51 and 52, on Plate 8 is enlarged 43 diameters. It is not
necessary to dwell upon the details of the structure of these Lepidostrobi, since they
were so fully described in my Memoir, Part III. These new examples have attained
to a somewhat larger size than my older ones did; but they more especially illustrate
the magnitude to which the lower, or macrosporal, portion B attained, as well as the
sharp boundary which, alike in 51 and 52, separates this from the upper or microsporal
half A.

I have for many years endeavoured to discover some specific character by which
different Lepidostrobi could be distinguished and identified, but thus far my efforts
