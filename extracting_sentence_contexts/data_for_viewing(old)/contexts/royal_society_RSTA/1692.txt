ao (figure 7b). We compared the energy obtained in our simulations with the values predicted
from hole boring (HB) [37] and CSA [38] models. According to the first, the HB velocity is
obtained balancing the radiation pressure exerted by the laser with the momentum flow: upp =
cT/2 (1 + 1/7) with 7 = nema}, /(2nemy) and mp proton mass [37,39]. Ions accelerated by the
static field associated with the HB attain an energy of 2mpc? 11 /(1 + 2171/7) [39]. When the HB
velocity exceeds the sound speed, then a collisionless shock is generated. The latter moves with
a velocity vs = cliten cad /(Smpne)]/2( + Kaq), Where kag = 5/3 is the adiabatic coefficient [40]. Ions
are reflected by the moving potential associated with the shock to a velocity v2, ~ 2vs and reach
an energy of MyC*(y>5 — 1), with y, =(1- v5,/c2)-V/?, Figure 7b reports these scaling laws for
ne = nj. Data from our simulations are observed to fall between these predictions. In particular,
we note that the accelerated proton beams exhibit higher energies than classical hole boring,
compatible with CSA. However, the Ht energy in our simulations does not appear to scale as
the CSA model. This is probably due to the fact that ions have not yet outrun the shock field, as
previously discussed. The variation of the shock speed during the acceleration process, as shown
in figure 4, may also play a role. Besides the average energy, also the Ht cutoff energy and the


number of ions reflected by the shock increase with the laser intensity. If a beam with higher
charge is desirable, protons with energies >> 30 MeV will not be stopped in the core and therefore
their energy will not contribute to the ignition. For the highest ap considered here, despite losing
some charge, we estimate that the number of ions with energy between 9 and 30 MeV will be
sufficient to create the ‘hot spot’. The ion maximum energy is always higher than predicted by
the CSA model. The latter is derived considering cold ions with no thermal spread. At shock
formation time, our simulations show that the upstream ions have a certain thermal distribution,
which will be maintained after reflection. An ion with velocity vo, different from 0, will thus
