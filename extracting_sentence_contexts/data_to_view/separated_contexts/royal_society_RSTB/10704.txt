Both women and men living in these areas also hold more
traditional attitudes regarding men’s and women’s work out-
side the home that men and women who live in historically
even sex ratio areas [17]. In the present paper we further test the long-term impact
of historic population sex ratios on contemporary descen-
dants, in particular on relationship satisfaction and overall
life satisfaction. Our research is motivated by the fact that
mating market conditions [18-22] and cultural norms
[23,24] have been shown to associate with both marital satis-
faction and overall feelings of well-being in modern societies. The reasons for these associations remain open to a number
of non-exclusive possible explanations. First, the well-being
and happiness of both sexes rises with marriage and drops
with divorce [18-21], and poor prospects of marriage are
associated with adverse mental health and happiness [21,25].
