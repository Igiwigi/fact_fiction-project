locusts, are not normal movements, but are caused by excessive temperatures. These
movements are definitely due to external factors and they continue only as long as the
conditions remain unfavourable’ (Uvarov 1937), p. iv).

Since then, Uvarov (1947, p. 16) has taken up the opposite view:

‘As a rule, if temperatures are above a certain moderate level, gregarious locusts are
more likely to be in flight than at rest. Flying with them may be regarded as a normal state,
and rest is enforced by environmental conditions.’

The evidence undoubtedly favours this latter view, rest being presumably sometimes
enforced not only by external but also by internal conditions. Since Uvarov’s 1937 statement
was based directly on experimental facts, but his 1947 one appeared in an essay without the
supporting data, it will be as well to give them here.

Desert Locust hoppers cease marching at midday on hot days and come to rest in the
coolest available situations (Fraenkel 1929; Predtechensky 1935 5; Kennedy 1945). Marching
starts, on the other hand, at 26° C according to Volkonsky (1942), or even 22° C according

to Kennedy (1939), temperatures which are far from ‘excessive’ for these insects. It is
equally clear that adult migration does not require an ‘unfavourable’ temperature.
Bodenheimer (1929) put the limits for ‘normal activity’ of mature, ph. gregaria Schistocerca
