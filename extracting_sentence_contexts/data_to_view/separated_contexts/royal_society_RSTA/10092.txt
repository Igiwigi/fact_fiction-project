But if this function is positive, so also is {7, 7},
and if this last is positive the system is unstable. Hence stability is always
impossible. As a fact, in all the solutions given above {7,7} is positive, and we
should have to move the spheres much further apart to make it negative, and
therefore on this ground alone the system is always unstable. But A is sometimes
positive and sometimes negative and vanishes for a certain value of \, As the
vanishing of A puzzled me a good deal, I propose to examine the matter further. Before doing so, however, I will show that the instability of the system may be
concluded from other considerations.
