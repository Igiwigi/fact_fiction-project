that «¢, = 0; the reason is that

(ii) The formulz (6.2) give us the U’s in terms of the (’s ; and (6.3) give us the C’s
in terms of the U’s. If the expressions for the ©’s in (6.3) are substituted in (6.2),
we shall get formule giving each U in terms of the U’s, say,

(Xia 27. Mm), — 9, (Uj; U, ... Uy):


122 W. F. SHEPPARD: THE FIT OF A FORMULA FOR DISCREPANT OBSERVATIONS.

The existence of these relations is due to the fact that, though (6.2) comprises m formule,
the formule only involve & C’s, and therefore there are m — k relations between them,
i.e., there are only & formule which are algebraically independent. Similarly only &
of (8.1) are algebraically independent.

We now have
oU, aC, _ aU,
a0, dU,  9U,’
(6.2) (6.3) (8.1)

(A=1,2... m) ==

Hence (7.2) may be written
