use of tools from Mathematics. Such a theory would
identify abstract properties of proofs and trace the limits
of provability. A particular question of interest was ‘is
Author for correspondence: there a proof of a contradiction from a given set of axioms
T?’ or otherwise stated: ‘is T inconsistent?’ Hilbert’s
goal with Proof Theory was to show, via combinatorial
methods, that no mathematical proof could have a
contradiction as its conclusion.

Gédel’s [1] incompleteness theorems showed that
Hilbert’s goal could not be attained in a. strict
sense: for sufficiently strong, consistent theories T, any
mathematical proof of the fact that T can only be
carried out in a mathematical theory T’ stronger than
T. In particular, Gédel’s theorems applied to theories
such as first-order and second-order arithmetic, i.e. PA
and Z».

Ever since, the Proof Theory has focused, in one way
or another, on attempting to avoid the limitations of
Gédel’s incompleteness theorems. These attempts have
led to rich theories of proofs, metamathematics and
unprovability results of various kinds. We mention two
of them.
