thermodynamics. The paper aims to construct a rational extended
thermodynamics (RET) theory of dense polyatomic
Subject Areas: gases by taking into account the experimental

evidence that the relaxation time of molecular
rotation and that of molecular vibration are quite
different from each other. For simplicity, we focus
on gases with only one dissipative process due to

mathematical physics, thermodynamics,
statistical physics

Keywords: bulk viscosity. In fact, in some polyatomic gases, the
non-equilibrium thermodynamics, extended effect of bulk viscosity is much larger than that of
thermodynamics, continuum mechanics, shear viscosity and heat conductivity. The present
dense gas, polyatomic gas, entropy theory includes the previous RET theory of dense

gases with six fields as a particular case, and it also
includes the RET theory of rarefied polyatomic gases

Author for correspondence: with seven fields in the rarefied-gas limit. The closure
