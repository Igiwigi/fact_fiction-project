This is
very clearly indicated by a comparison of intensities of corresponding lines as observed
by L., D. and B. The following are a few examples out of a large number illustrating
this. The numbers following a wave-length give the intensities as estimated
respectively by BAty and by Liverne and Dewar :—

5191 5, 6 4890 5, 3
5188 ee! 4887 5, 0
5080 ie 4884 1, 4
5068 not seen, 5 4883 6, 0
5045 Stat 6 4844 10, 10

As between the two spectra also, a fact noticed by L. and D. is of importance. They say “there is one very remarkable change in the xenon spectrum produced by
the introduction of a jar into the cireuit. Without the jar the xenon gives two.
