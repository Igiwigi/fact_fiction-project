than either of the two plants now growing at Kew.t The Kew plants have been
raised from seed sown in 1879. Comparing these with the larger specimens seen
at Haikamchab, one is convinced that the period of 70-100 years usually assigned
as the duration of the life of these plants{ is much too small. Mr. Hewrrr, who
knows the plant in both its localities, informs me that the largest specimens to
be seen in Damaraland are smaller than many in Mossamedes.§

The débris formed at the decaying ends of the leaves retains moisture absorbed from
the nightly fogs, and protects the underlying sand from desiccation for at least some
hours after the uncovered surface has become quite dry. Baum believes that the
night-fogs are a determining condition of the existence of Welwitschia, and seems
to suggest that it directly derives some of its water from the moisture precipitated
from them.|| While the known facts of the distribution of Welwitschia are not
unfavourable to the former hypothesis—and the same may be said of Acanthosicyos
—it is extremely improbable that the sea-fogs have more than an indirect influence
upon either plant. The great depth of the absorbing part of the root-system of
Welwitschia** makes it almost impossible that any moisture retained by the sand
within several feet of the surface can be exploited by the root. -Both plants must
undoubtedly be classed with the deep-rooted forms which owe their existence to
their power of tapping subterranean water.ft The moist patches of sand under
the masses of leaf-débris form the habitat of an insect-fauna,{{ numerous in individuals
if not in species.

Plants growing in contact form natural grafts of very remarkable appearance. Of
three such united groups, one consisted of a solid mass of five plants—one male and
