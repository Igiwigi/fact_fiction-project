then there is a semigroup {T(f), t > 0} in X such that (2.2) holds; the limit is uniform, as before, and
R,,A > @ is the resolvent of the limit semigroup generator.

Both propositions have been proved independently by H.F. Trotter [5] and J. Neveu [6] (in a
special case). The name of T. Kato is inseparably linked to these propositions because of his two-
page note [7]: H.F. Trotter in his proof of the convergence theorem is apparently a bit too quick
to conclude that the limit pseudo-resolvent R,, 4 > @ is in fact the resolvent of a certain operator
(to be shown to be the generator of the limit semigroup). Corollary 1 of Kato’s [7] may be used to
justify Trotter’s proof.

(c) Kato's Theorem: a foretaste of the glory to come

Both Trotter-Neveu—Kato Theorems seem natural today; we have become accustomed to the fact
that statements on semigroups can be translated into statements on resolvents and vice versa. But
this awareness has been growing with the theory of semigroups, and simply was not there in
1957 when [1] was published (or at least was not there in full), for if it were, what we call now the
Trotter-Neveu-Kato Theorems would had been easily proved much earlier by luminaries such as
Hille, Phillips or Yosida. We venture to believe that before 1958 it was not clear whether a path to
convergence theorems leading through resolvents is a natural one; it was even less clear how to
prove that (2.3) implies (2.2).

To see this, let us come back to T. Kato’s 1954 paper [8], reproduced nearly in extenso in [1]. Its
starting point is an intensity matrix indexed by natural numbers, i.e. a matrix (q;;);;>1 such that
Lje1 91 =9, 12 1, and qj; > 0 for i ¥j, and the aim is to prove a generation theorem in the space
¢! of absolutely summable sequences ()iz1 (with standard norm |\(&)>1|| = Dis1 él). Because
