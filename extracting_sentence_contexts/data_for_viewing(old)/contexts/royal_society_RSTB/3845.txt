0°34 mm. by 0°35 mm., and the stylar tube itself practically circular at 0°1 mm.
That is to say, it is the growth-pressure of the basal part of the nucellus which does
the work of opening up the flat chink between the scales, into which the perianth-tube
extends in the functional flower. In the earliest stages, the deformation of the bract:
and the pressure of the flower is followed in developmental figures (fig. 5); and the
resultant chamber left between successive scales in fig. 2. In the case of the
staminate flower, with ovule of much the same size, growing under closely similar
conditions, between very similar scales, room is still found for the whole andreecium
and perianth members in the chink above and on the flanks of the ovule which takes
the pressure; so that mere pressure in the bud will not account for the extensive
reduction of the ovulate flower, which, as in the case of higher Angiosperms,
reduces by obliterating all parts except those which have a present essential function.
It is, in fact, the biologically important seed-dispersal wing of the perianth which

monopolises not only all the room in the cone but also the food supply, and
thus appears as a secondary useful alternative for a production of useless vestigial
organs.

It is also convenient at this stage to mark a distinction between a cone and a
strobilus, the former implying a condensed xerophytic structure which aims at
presenting the smallest transpiring surface for its volume, and hence approximates
