Cheating. Breaking of shared rules, including geneti-
cally encoded phenotypes or behaviours, that leads to
a fitness advantage for the cheater.

3, Survey of cancer across life

Viewing cancer as a phenomenon of cheating on the
cooperation that characterizes multicellular organisms
generates predictions that can be tested by surveying inde-
pendent multicellular lineages. Larger and more complex
forms of multicellularity (based on the probability per cell
of mutations and the fact that complex multicellularlity
requires more complex regulatory networks that can be
damaged) should have both greater susceptibility to cancer
and more mechanisms for cancer suppression. Rather than
focus exclusively on cancer as clinically defined for humans
(i.e. characterized by invasion and metastasis), we consider
cancer-like phenomena more broadly, which include neo-
plastic growths characterized by abnormal proliferation
and differentiation (hereafter, we refer to ‘cancer-like’ as
‘cancer’). In this section, we describe what is known about
cancer-like phenomena using examples from each lineage
with complex multicellularity.
