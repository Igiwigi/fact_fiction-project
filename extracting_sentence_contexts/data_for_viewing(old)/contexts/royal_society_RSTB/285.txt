Svenzev’s memoir has only been published during the present year, my name of Rachiopteris Grayit
will have the precedence, unless Professor Srenzet has given the name to his plant in any earlier
publication.—February 12th, 1889.


158 PROFESSOR W. C. WILLIAMSON ON THE ORGANISATION

The exterior of the cortex of this plant was densely clothed with hairs. Though
longitudinal sections through the specimen described present a somewhat obscure
arrangement of tissues and organs, these hairs enable us to distinguish external
surfaces from internal structures. The difficulty of doing this is the greater since
two distinct stems are pressed closely together in the fragment of ganister in
which my specimens are preserved, and also from the fact that the innumerable
small cylindrical organs, d, variously intersected, and each with an ill preserved
vascular bundle in its interior, abound in all my preparations both within the cortex,
and externally to it, as at d,d. Similar structures appear to exist in M. Runautr’s
specimens of Anachoropteris, but that observer regards them as representing
petiolar bundles. Mine, like his, are ill preserved; but they more closely resemble
adventitious roots than petiolar structures. A similar one M. Renavuit himself
regards as a “racine adventif.” These organs are about ‘066 of an inch in diameter.

That no classification of these fossil Ferns based solely upon the transverse sections
of their petiolar bundles is or can be of much value, is clearly shown when tested
amongst those living Ferns the classification of which is chiefly based upon their
sporangial reproductive organs. But, I think, I can show that we have here to do
