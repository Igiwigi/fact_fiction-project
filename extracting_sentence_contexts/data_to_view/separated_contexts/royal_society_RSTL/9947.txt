temperatures must be immeasurably small. Tt is well known that Macxvus tested his
foregone conclusion, and found it verified ; while T, on the other hand, as above stated,
justified mine. The various gases which had been examined in the experimental tube with regard
to their powers of absorption, were next tested as regards their powers of radiation.
