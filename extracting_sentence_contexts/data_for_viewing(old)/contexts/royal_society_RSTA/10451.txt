are, as it were, drawn asunder, and remain at each end of the plates, being however
often connected by a thin straight line (fig. 4).

In all cases, the angles of the plate determine the figure formed on it. With
regard to other general points connected with the formation of these figures. The
nature of the dust used is not a matter of importance, it may be composed of organic

or inorganie matter; the spores of a fungus, or magnesia, or the dust from ashes

or fumes of ammonium chloride. In fact, the necessary condition is that the
dust be very fine, then always the same figure is formed. The product formed
by burning magnesium is, however, the best form of dust to use. It is easily
obtained, and has a silvery whiteness in appearance, which gives distinctness to the
figures. With regard to the plate on which the figure is to form, its composition,
like that of the dust, is of no importance; the shape determines the figure, not its
constitution. Glass, for several reasons, is the best material for the plate, but copper,
zine, silver, antimony or other metal may be used, or ebonite, celluloid, black india-
rubber, cardboard, &c., in fact, the receiving surface is not necessarily a_ solid
substance ; mercury in a square vessel will have deposited on it a figure similar to
that on a piece of glass of the same size and shape, and, still more, the surface of the
glass plate may be coated with oil, gum, copal-varnish, &e., and the cross will form
as if they were not present. Obviously, with regard to the visibility of the figures
