of the current with different E.M.F.’s, the experiments being made in the order
indicated :—

The values of the current may be regarded as constant within the probable
experimental error.

It is evident that at pressures near atmospheric, saturation is attained with a P.D.
of less than 40 volts. As a matter of fact, in these cases, where all the ionisation is
of one sign, there is, of course, no recombination and, provided the whole of the hot
wire is at a positive potential great enough to overcome the tendency to diffuse back
into the wire, all the ions produced reach the collecting electrode. A saturation
current is thus obtained with a very small voltage. This is shown by some
experiments made at a pressure of the same order of magnitude, 528 millims., as in
the last experiment, and at a temperature of 706°C. The fall of potential along the
filament, due to the heating current, was equal to 3:3 volts. The currents obtained
with the various assigned mean voltages on the filament are as follows :—
