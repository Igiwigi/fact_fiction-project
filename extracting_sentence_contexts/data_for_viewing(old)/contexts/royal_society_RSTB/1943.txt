(F. platycarpus) which he especially studied. His figure* for this plant, compared
with our own (Plate 19, fig. 1) for Ascophyllum, shows how uniform is the general
character of the mitosis in the various related species of Fucacew, for the correspond-
ing stage in #, vesiculosus, in which we have also seen it, shows no essential points
of difference. During, or soon after, the reconstitution of the two daughter nuclei
one of them moves to the base of the cell, whilst the other remains in the projecting
papilla, and a wall is then formed cutting off the true oogonium from the stalk cell.

The oogonium next increases greatly in size, and its cytoplasm is granular and
betrays clearly a foam structure in well-fixed material. The nucleus is of a large
size. As the division of the nucleus draws near, the cytoplasm undergoes a change
which in plants that have been preserved with any preparation containing osmic acid
is very marked owing to the fact that the acid is very slightly or not at all reduced
at this stage. Thus the oogonia in this condition are easily distinguished from the
rest, even under a magnifying power far too low to admit of structural details being
discerned at all. This fact is of interest, indicating as it does that special metabolic
processes are going on within the cytoplasm, and that they are associated with
karyokinetie activity.

The nuclei are, as has been said, of a large size, and they contain one or more
nucleoli, together with a beautifully clear chromatic network, which is even at this
stage seen to be markedly polarised (figs. 2, 3). Commonly, at the same time, a
