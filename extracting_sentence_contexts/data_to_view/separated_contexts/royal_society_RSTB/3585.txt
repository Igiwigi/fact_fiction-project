The land barrier joining
Britain to Scandinavia, which had kept the southern part of what is now the North
Sea from the access of the cold northern waters, ever since the earliest Tertiary
period, disappeared at the beginning of the deposition of the Red Crag.

9. If these propositions are justified, it remains a question for later enquiry as
to whether the men who made the Sub-Crag implements were of greater antiquity
than those who made the implements of the high plateau gravels of Kent or than
those recognised by some archeologists as the makers of roughly chipped flints
found in other localities, but not hitherto generally admitted as of human
workmanship.

10. In any case, the implements from the Sub-Crag beds in East Anglia are of a
special and very distinct type, and cannot be associated with any of those known
from any other locality.

| Postscript, February 15, 1912.â€”Whilst this memoir has been in the press, two
important facts bearing on the history of the Icenian industry have come to light,
which should be mentioned here, however briefly. The. first is the diseoyery by
Mr. Epwarp Heron-A.en of worked flints, resembling some of those found in the
Sub-Crag deposit, in a gravel of undetermined age resting on Eocene clay, upon the
seashore of Selsea Bill, Sussex.
