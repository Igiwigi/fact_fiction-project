cellular molecules in turn acting in different pathways. In the
pearl oyster, miRNAs, such as novel-Mir-1 and Pma-Mir-2305,
target mRNAs for shell matrix proteins (SMPs) which are con-
sidered key components in the shell and pearl formation
[37,61,62]. Also, the expression of SMPs can be indirectly
modulated by the interaction of miRNAs with components
located upstream in the biomineralization-related pathways,
such as pmpRUNT-1 (by Pia-Mir-183 [63]) or the neuropeptide
receptor Y2R (by Pma-Mir-29a [38]). As regards Hyriopsis
cumingii, a peculiar miRNA (Hcu-Mir-4504) participates in
the regulation of pigment biosynthesis. Intriguingly, the bind-
ing of sucha miRNA to the melanocyte inducing transcription
factor (HeMITF) can impair melanin production. In fact, MITF
regulates genes involved in melanin biogenesis, interacting via
a typical basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH Zip) to

sequencing is often based on stem-loop RT-qPCR or on the
dual-luciferase assay, the latter aimed at verifying the
miRNA interactions with their putative target genes. Below,
we provide a comparative overview of the bivalve miRNA
functions investigated so far (figure 3). Specific miRNAs
have been demonstrated to play a role during the immune
response of C. gigas against Vibrio splendidus. Following
bacterial infection, the invertebrate-specific miRNA Cgi-
Mir-2d is upregulated and leads to the enhancement of
