For finite concentrations, the
liquidus slope, equation (2.19), depends on the square of the interface velocity, my «(V/Vp)’,
explicitly.! In the theory of diluted mixtures /alloys, the kinetic liquidus was obtained as linearly
proportional to the velocity [17], i.e. my « V/Vp. However, as we show in the following section,
the predictions of the crystal growth kinetics are quantitatively valid using equation (2.19)
and ref. [17] due to the fact that the strongest dependence of m, on V is dictated by the
nonlinear behaviour of the atomic distribution function at the interface k,(V). An estimation
of the pressure influence (with PY,40) on the velocity-dependent kinetic liquidus should
be specially given. On the one hand, the pressure plays an insignificant role in the crystal
growth under usual circumstances (see Chapter 2 in the monograph of Glicksman [39]).
