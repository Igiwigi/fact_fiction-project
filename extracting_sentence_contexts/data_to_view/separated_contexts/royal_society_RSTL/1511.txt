5,108 The year 1792 was a very wet one, and by many ima-
gined to exceed all others, but that does not appear to be
fact; the wet of last year is fresh in memory, that of
former years is more forgotten. It might seem the wetter,
because the autumn of 1791 was” wet; '80- that there was a
long continuance: of it; and perhaps there might be more
rain in some other places than here, as we had no great thun-
der storms all the summer at this place, which they had in
several parts, Some not many miles off. The wettest years


Mr. BARKER's Regis/er, &c. 227

here were about 1774 and 1782, which I have therefore com-
pared with last year, in No. I. where I have set down the
whole rain, and cast up the sum, from January the first, to
the end of every month, in each year: and it appears, that to
the end of January, to the end of February, and of March, the
wettest was 1774, the next 1782, and 1792 was less wet than
either of them.
