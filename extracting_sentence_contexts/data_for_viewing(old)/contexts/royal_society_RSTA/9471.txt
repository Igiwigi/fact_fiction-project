sbperhaps sufficient to be conclusive. When the comparison is extended to the wider
‘& range covered by Hocan’s experiments, the divergence would appear to be decisive.
S If the records of the observations could be accepted without criticism, it could be
Sstated that the law of decrease of amplitude of the electro-magnetic waves with
‘3 increasing distance from the sending station, as expressed by the formula (59), has
% been tested and found adequate over a wide range of distances and waye-lengths ;
eand further, since this formula cannot be reconciled even approximately with
> Macponatp’s theory, it could be inferred, as in fact it has been, that diffraction cannot
account for the observed facts.

22. I hesitate to draw this inference for two reasons. First, there is some doubt as

& to what the observed facts really are. Second, a different interpretation of the

B available records leads to precisely the opposite conclusion.

S$ As regards the observations, I wish to make it clear at the outset that I do not

5 undervalue the work of Austin and Hocan. The investigations which they

A undertook were of such difficulty that to obtain results, so consistent as theirs, must
have required much patient labour and an uncommon degree of skill. Any criticism
that I venture to make is prompted solely by the desire to arrive at a more complete
comprehension of the matter.
