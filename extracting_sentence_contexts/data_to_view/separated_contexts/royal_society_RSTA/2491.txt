If we take the mean diurnal inequality for the year, the range in H is only about
three-fifths that in D, while cos D is three times sin D. It follows from the last of
equations (2) that the influence of the D diurnal changes on W will largely exceed
that of the H changes. Hence the diurnal inequality in W must show a fairly close
approach in type to that in D. In the case of N the H diurnal changes exert more
influence than the D changes, but the preponderance is less. As a matter of fact,
however, there is a very close resemblance between the diurnal inequalities in H and
N. The inequality in D if reversed has a considerable resemblance to that in H, and
the contributions from H and D to the N diurnal inequality have opposite signs, so
numerically they assist one another. It is pretty obvious, comparing figs. 1 to 7, that if we measured east-west changes
positive to the east, instead of to the west, and I changes positive from instead of
towards the vertical, the diurnal inequality curves for the year in all the six elements
considered here, and in D as welf, would agree in having as one of their most
prominent features a principal minimum occurring within an hour or two of noon.
