in a late season the regression of the gonads may set in before the site has become
suitable. Lack concludes that with this species, therefore, breeding is controlled
partly by the nervous system.

Morpuy (1936) in a book just published on the oceanic birds of S. America,
states that in the Atlantic equatorial isles Fernando de Noronha and St. Paul Rocks,
the majority of the fowl apparently has no breeding season, for eggs and young
may be found in any month of the twelve, but that the sooty tern is an exception.
With this species there is evidence that the nesting season on Ascension begins a little
earlier in each successive year, and that the change in time is sufficient to make the
birds breed on the average four times within three years. It would seem as if in
this species breeding periodicity depended entirely upon an internal sexual rhythm
unaffected by seasonal exteroceptive factors. Murpuy also records some facts
about the periodic breeding of certain species of penguins which are in striking
contrast to the great majority of birds. The Peruvian and African penguins, that
is, the two members of the genus Spheniscus which, coming presumably from the
south, have invaded warm-temperate and tropical environments, may have two
broods of young, nearly the whole of the year being occupied in breeding operations.
Kearton (1930), says that the African penguins have mating seasons in February
and in September. According to Levick (1914), the black-footed penguins in the
Zoological Gardens can breed several times a year. It would appear that the
penguins are almost or quite unique among birds in having freed themselves from
external seasonal influences. In this respect they are comparable to the domestic
dog among mammals. Murpny also gives many instances of sea birds of various
kinds which seem to have a “ continuous breeding season” under uniform conditions.
