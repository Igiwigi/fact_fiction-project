The rain data for Rothamsted have been analysed for 65 years ; there are some indica-
tions that the wet years tend to occur in spells ; a continuous and progressive change
is observable in the distribution of rain through the year ; in other respects the sequence
appears to be fortuitous. Rainfall changes account for only a portion of the slow changes
observed in the yields.

Curves showing the average effect on the yield, for each additional inch of rain, through-
out the year, have been obtained for 13 plots of Broadbalk wheat field, which have been
under uniform experimental treatment since 1852. On all the plots dry weather is
generally beneficial. A detailed comparison of the several plots indicates a predominant
influence of the effect of rain in removing soil nitrates ; the cause of other well-marked
features cannot safely be asserted without further research, which it is hoped may be
facilitated by the body of facts expressed in these curves.

Previous investigations bearing particularly on the present data are briefly discussed
in the last section.
