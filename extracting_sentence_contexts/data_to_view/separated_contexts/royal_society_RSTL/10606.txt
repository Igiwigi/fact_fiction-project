==bf(L), the straight line B &=20,

ris

sufficiently rapidly at first ; (2) it attains a higher maximum than is actually
realized. Let us examine these errors in detail. (1) The angle the characteristie makes with the axis of avscissm near the origin is

mainly determined by the line B, We have in fact a very considerable extension of

the area. of the field beyond that which lies under the bored face of the pole-piece. The following consideration will show that the extension may be considerable.
