The larvae of X. astia also failed to grow
at 97-5 and 100% r.x. with 38° C. Some larvae of this species even grew for a short time
at 38°C with 80 and 90% r.u. The fact that its larvae can withstand 97-5% R.H. for
a much longer time than 100% R.a. appears to me to indicate the direct adverse effect of
a high vapour pressure on the growth of the larvae. Thus high humidities by themselves exert an adverse effect on the growth of rat-flea
larvae, but only with extremely high temperatures. This is possibly due to either of two
causes or perhaps both; first, the larvae may be susceptible to ‘water poisoning’; secondly,
the high vapour pressure may itself exercise a harmful effect on them.
