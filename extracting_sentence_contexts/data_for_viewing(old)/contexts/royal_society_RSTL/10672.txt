ON THE TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE OF MAY 17, 1882. 267

The promimence spectrum.

Close to the solar limb, on both sides of the photograph, bright lines are geen which
evidently belong to the prominences. On the northern limb these are most numerous
and brightest. It seems certain, in fact, from a comparison with the photograph
obtained in the prismatic camera, that the slib must have crossed the prominence 3,
which, as has already been mentioned, was rich in ultra-violet light. On the same
plate above and below, the solar spectrum had been photographed after the eclipse,
and we had, therefore, no difficulty in identifying the principal lines. We see in the
first place the calcium lines H and K. These two lines are, indeed, the great feature

Sf the photograph. Being of great intensity they do not confine themselves to the
rominence regions, but appear as bright lines through the corona and over the body
Sf the moon. The light which is due to them must, in fact, have been s0 strong that
he scattered light was sufficiently intense in our atmosphere to give the appearance
and to be conspicuous everywhere in the neighbourhood of the moon, or else that the
ns forming the image on the slit was 80 illuminated as to give this result. It can,
