488 PROFESSOR CLERK MAXWELL ON THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD.

it resides in the electrified bodies, conducting circuits, and magnets, in the form of an
unknown quality called potential energy, or the power of producing certain effects at a
distance. On our theory it resides in the electromagnetic field, in the Space Surrounding
the electrified and magnetic bodies, as well as in those bodies themselves, and is in two
different forms, which may be described without hypothesis as magnetic polarization
and electric polarization, or, according to a very probable hypothesis, as the motion and
the strain of one and the same medium.

(75) The conclusions. arrived at in the present paper are independent of this hypo-
thesis, being deduced from experimental facts of three kinds :â€”

1. The induction of electric currents by the increase or diminution of neighbouring
currents according to the changes in the lines of force passing through the circuit.

2. 'The distribution of magnetic intensity according to the variations of a magnetic
potential. ;

3. The induction (or influence) of statical electricity through dielectrics.

We may now proceed to demonstrate from these principles the existence and laws of
the mechanical forces which act upon electric currents, magnets, and electrified bodies
placed in the electromagnetic field.
