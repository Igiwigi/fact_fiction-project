innovations u;(f) are assumed non-Gaussian and mutually independent, but owing to the
temporal mixing by the matrices B,, the source signals s;(t) are not necessarily independent. Then,
we model the observed data x(t) by the conventional mixing model (2.2).

Various methods for estimating such a model have been proposed by Gomez-Herrero et al. [54],
Zhang & Hyvarinen [55] and Haufe ef al. [56]. A particularly simple way to estimate the model
is to first compute the innovation process of x(f) by fitting a VAR on it, and then do basic ICA on
those innovations, i.e. the residuals [54]. (See also HyWarinen et al. [19] for a related method based
on fitting ICA on the residuals of a VAR model.)

Alternatively, we can assume that the components s;(t) are independent in a certain frequency
band only. If the frequency band is known a priori, we can just temporally filter the data to
concentrate on that frequency band. In fact, linear temporal filtering does not change the validity
of the linear mixing model, nor does it change the mixing matrix. Furthermore, an optimal
frequency band can be estimated from the data as well [57].

A different framework of dependent components in time series was proposed by Lahat
et al. [58], combining the idea of independent subspaces discussed earlier with suitable
non-stationarities.


(d) Further models of dependencies

A model in which the components are linearly correlated (without considering any time structure)
was proposed by Sasaki et al. [59]. The idea is to consider a generative model similar to the one
