The changes occurring during the formation of a single ganglion-cell, in connexion
with what is undoubtedly at first a single granular fibre, are of the utmost interest. I
cannot be perfectly confident that the history I give of these changes is absolutely true
in all points of detail; for, as may be easily imagined, to isolate fine fibres with nuclei
exhibiting the different stages of change is a difficulty of no ordinary character, while

* My friend Mr. Looxnazrr Cranks has not observed this division of the cells which enter into the formation
of the ganglia on the posterior roots of the nerves of mammalia, He describes the gradual increase in size and
the alteration in structure and form of the cells as development adyances, but says nothing about their increase
in number, Tt is true that Mr. Cranke's observations were made upon mammalia, while the statements in my
paper refer only to the frog; but it is almost certain—I think indeed that it is quite certain—that if the cells do
not multiply by division in mammalia they do not do 80 in the frog. Upon this question of fact, therefore, I
regret to say that Mr. CLarks and myself are at is8w0. The 8pecimens from which my figures 11 & 12, which
show this division most distinetly, haye been copied, may be examined by any one who dexires to 8ee them.
This question shall be further investigated by me. Mr. Locknazr CLarks's obseryations will be found on

hundreds of specimens may be examined without finding one in which such fibres are
observed.

The drawings represented in figs. 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, & 18 show the points I haye
