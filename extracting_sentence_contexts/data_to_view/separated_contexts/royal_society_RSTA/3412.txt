554 MR. JOHN AITKEN ON THE FORMATION OF

The importance of the dustless film from the under side of the plate is evidenced by
the fact observed by Dr. Russetn that no figure is obtained unless the plate be
supported above the bottom of the receiver. When we examine by means of the
beam of light the surface of a plate laid on the bottom of the receiver, we still find
the dust-free film of air over the plate when the plate is pretty hot. This dustless
film is very thin at the edges and thickens towards the centre, and a rising current
can be seen flowing over it towards the centre, the rising current having a dustless
core.
