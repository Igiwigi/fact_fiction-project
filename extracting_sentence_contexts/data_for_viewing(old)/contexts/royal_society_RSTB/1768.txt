figs. 10 and 11), The presumption, however, is that the leaf-trace bundles, except
where still quite close to the central cylinder, had a concentric structure.

The position of the first-formed trache of the bundle is by no means evident, but
was most probably central (Figs, 9 and 10). Usually, all the trachee are spirally
thickened, but in the clearer cases the more central are the smaller, and in the
longitudinal section just referred to a lax spiral is seen in the middle of the xylem
strand,

I find no difference in orientation or structure between the bundles of the upper
and lower lobes, a point to which special attention has been directed. It will be
noticed that it is only after all the three bundles for the inferior segments have
separated that those for the superior segments are given off. It is this fact which
appears to indicate that the lower segments represent the main part of the leaf, just
as is the case in the strobilus of Sphenophyllum Dawsoni.

The structure of the cortex of the axis is fairly uniform throughout, consisting of
slightly elongated, rather thick-walled cells, becoming smaller towards the outside.

As seen in transverse section, the cortex appears marked out into areas, each
enclosing a bundle, or a group of bundles, belonging to the same leaf-trace (see
Photograph 2). The cells forming the boundaries of these areas are slightly
compressed.

The most characteristic point. in the structure of the cortex is the presence of
