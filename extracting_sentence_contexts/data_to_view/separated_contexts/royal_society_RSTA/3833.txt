the ceramic sample and the window material. These perturbations can be reduced by choosing
sapphire as window material due to the fact that the impedance ratio between silicon carbide and
sapphire is closer than that between silicon carbide and lithium fluoride.

6. Conclusion

Currently, a deeper understanding of the mechanical behaviour and damage modes of brittle
materials such as ceramics as a function of the loading rate is required. To do so, the plate-impact
testing technique has been widely employed since the 1970s.
