There were a few lagging larvae of X. brasiliensis that lived
more than 18 days. The drying effect of 60% R.u. with 32Â° C on the larvae of X. astia was
most pronounced, for many of them died in the first instar. This shows that this humidity
is very near the lower vital limit of this larva; this is also borne out by the fact that the
initial moisture of the food affected the proportion of successful development. When the
initial exposure of the food, which had been previously kept at 80% R.u. for a few days,
to 60% R.H. was for only 1 or 2 days, as in the first experiment, a number of the larvae grew
into adults. In contrast, if the food was first brought into equilibrium with this low humidity,
as in the second experiment, many larvae died within 4 days; only a few of them bred
successfully.
