266 MR. NEWPORT ON THE TEMPERATURE OF INSECTS,

in the same insect, but varies according to certain conditions of the insect. 'These

views were till further confirmed and extended Ã¾y obseryations on the Sphinz Hi-

gustri, S. populi, S. ocellata, Linx., and Cerura vinula, STEPH. 'The first and last of

these insects, from their large size and frequency of occurrence, afford us the means

of ascertaining all the facts connected with the temperature of larve, and are those

on which most of my subsequent observations have been made. It is at about the

fifth or sixth day after the larva of Sphinz ligustri has assumed its last 8kin, that it

evolves the greatest quantity of heat. It then feeds most voraciously, and usually
weighs about 80 grains. Its greatest temperature is then 1*3 above the temperature
of the atmosphere. I have seldom or ever found it higher, while on the eighth or
ninth day it seldom exceeds nine tenths, and a little while before its change into the
pupa state perhaps not more than five tenths. Its quantity of respiration at that time
is diminished, and its temperature is reduced by copious cutaneous perspiration,
which becomes very apparent when the insect is much excited. The difference which
