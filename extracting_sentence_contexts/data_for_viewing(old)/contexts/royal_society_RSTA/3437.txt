for simultaneous photothermal therapy (PTT) and CT due to their strong extinction in the near-
infrared (NIR) region [42]. In addition, there have been efforts to develop multifunctional CT
contrast agents via conjugating various functional molecules such as targeting ligands, peptides
and Raman reporters on the gold nanomaterials [2,43].

Although gold nanomaterials are attractive materials as CT contrast agents, they are too
expensive to be used in clinics. In fact, approximately 50g of gold should be consumed for a
human whole-body scanning session, making it hard to be commercialized in the market [37].
Thus, there have been attempts to find other cheaper alternatives. For example, lanthanides
have been proposed as CT contrast agents because gadolinium complexes have been used
as MRI contrast agents in clinics [36]. However, the lanthanide-based molecules exhibit a
short circulation time, which prevents targeted imaging. Subsequently, to increase circulation
time, macromolecule-conjugated lanthanide chelates have been studied [44]. Dysprosium-DTPA-
dextran with a size of approximately 10nm enables enhanced CT imaging of liver tumours and
blood vessels. In addition, emulsions containing lanthanide ions and lanthanide-based inorganic
nanoparticles have also been investigated as multifunctional CT contrast agents [45,46].

Tantalum is one of the ideal elements as CT contrast agents owing to its high biocompatibility
and radiopacity. In clinics, tantalum-based stents and implants are used frequently. Tantalum
