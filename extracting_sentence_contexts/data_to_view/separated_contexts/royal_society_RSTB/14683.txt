We
can find detailed descriptions of skull bone elements in textbooks on human
anatomy, veterinary anatomy, zoology and vertebrate palaeontology. If we
pick up and open comparative anatomy textbooks (e.g. [32-34]), we find that
lizards and mammals are depicted to have a great number of bones that are
labelled using the same nomenclature. As students of comparative anatomy,
somehow we have long taken these depictions to represent incontrovertible
facts. However, growing evidence arising from palaeontology, embryology
and experimental developmental biology has started to finally revise our
long-standing homological understanding of the vertebrate skull [35-38]. What these recent advances hint to us is that we may still know little or have
largely misunderstood even the basic settings of the mammalian skull.
