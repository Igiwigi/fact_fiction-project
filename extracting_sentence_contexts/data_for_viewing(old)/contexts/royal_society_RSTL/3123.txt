in glauberite*, This eminent philosopher has found, by direct experiment, that
heat expands a rhomb. of calcareous spar in the direction of its axis, and con-
tracts it in directions at right angles to that axis4 ; that the rhomb thus be-
comes less obtuse, approaching to the cubical forms which have three equal axes,
and that its double refraction diminishes. All these effects are the necessary con-
sequences of the preceding views. The expansion in the direction of the axis,
and the contraction of all the equatorial diameters diminish the compression
of the axes of the oblate spheroidal molecules, and must therefore diminish its
double refraction, as well as the inclination of the faces of the rhomb. | In

+ It follows from this fact, that massive carbonate of lime, in which the axes of the molecules have
every possible direction, should neither expand nor contract by heat, and would therefore form an
invariable pendulum. As there must be, in any given length of massive carbonate of lime, as many
expanding as there are contracting axes, then, if the contractions and expansions in each individual
erystal are equal, they will destroy one another ; but if they are proportional to their lengths, the con-
tractions will exceed the dilatations. In this case, we have only to combine the marble with an ordi-
nary expanding substance, to haye an invariable pendulum. The balances of chronometers might
be thus made of mineral bodies,

like manner it will be found that in sulphate of lime and glauberite the ex-
