information, such as is found in organisms’ DNA, choosing the evolutionary encoding of protein
amino acid sequences in nucleic acid sequences as the paradigm of natural processes of this sort.
Rather than focusing on the particular assignments of the apparently optimized, near-universal
genetic code that finally emerged, we will describe general features of the process of coding
evolution and seek to demarcate some prerequisites of coding self-organization in dynamic
molecular systems. These prerequisites amount to informatic relationships between molecular
structures and functional properties that are, from a physico-chemical point of view, entirely
arbitrary, and which seem so massively coincidental that some theorists have been led to suppose
that the code has an intelligent design of extraterrestrial origin [14]. However, what we will see
is that similar base triplets are most likely to end up as codons for amino acids with similar
molecular properties, not through some process of code optimization, but simply because each
step in the progressive differentiation of coding assignments had to preserve the functionality
that had already been established. In fact, information-rich coding is only possible in natural
systems that hit upon some operationally encoded definition of ‘similarity’, no matter how rough
and ready initially, and then progressively refine it, most likely through transitions over a series
of discrete steps.

Polymeric sequence information signifies nothing in itself [15] but it can acquire and have a
sustained meaning relative to a system which interprets it and in which it is adequately preserved
as a result of ongoing natural selection. The stability criterion of Eigen [11] imposes a limit
on the length of such sequences (amount of information) that can be preserved relative to the
accuracy of sequence symbol (alphabet letter) copying and the relative fitness of the selected
sequence. In extant biological systems, the amount of DNA information needed to specify the
main components of the machinery of translation (genetic code interpreter) is of order 10° bases, if
one includes aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) enzymes, tRNAs, ribosomal RNA and proteins,
