Thus for
kernels of this kind there is no well-behaved solution for arbitrary well-behaved functions
k(x,y) and g(x), and it is known theoretically that this is true for all regular kernels. Fred-
holm’s equation of the first kind is then almost always a singular integral equation, in the
sense of this paper. The problem is further complicated by the fact that, given the necessary relation between

k and g, there may be an infinity of solutions. For a kernel of the form k(x, y) = Ps a,(x) b,(y),
1

for example, it is clear that no solution exists unless g(x) has the form
g(x) a p ¢,a,(%),
