Overall, greenspace without SuDS was implicitly and explicitly preferred,
and greenspace without SuDS regarded as more attractive, tidier and safer. However, the
wide distribution of implicit and explicit tests scores for greenspace with SuDS illustrates the
complexity of public perceptions of blue-green space. The fact that the strongly negative explicit
scores were not reflected in the implicit scores may suggest that explicit attitudes towards tidiness
and safety may not be deep-rooted and may be subject to some social bias influenced by, for
example, concerns around public space that are deemed to be more socially acceptable. For
instance, the data suggest that a small proportion of respondents are more concerned about
tidiness and safety than they instinctively feel, perhaps because they are rationalizing about the
advantages and disadvantages associated with SuDS and consciously decide to highlight socially
acceptable concerns, such as tidiness and safety. Although safety and tidiness are important
features of SuDS, designers should take care not to put too much weight on strongly negative
preferences expressed by a minority.
