Thus it seems that one should recognize that the various host con-
ditions are self-contained units and that the Ooencyrtus female reacts to complexes such
as the gipsy moth egg, gipsy moth egg containing a parasite larva, etc. To relate the
behaviour to anything less is to relate it to abstractions which do not exist, as such,
in nature. Thompson (1937) states that in the case of the Tachinid Compsilura concinnata
and its hosts, the “latter have in common practically nothing but the fact that they are
attacked by Compsilura and that they are all ‘caterpillars’—a term to which, however,
no definition can be attached that is not applicable to the forms not attacked by the
parasite”. However, the relationship Compsilura—caterpillar is a perfectly valid bio-
logical concept of a general tendency in host selection by this parasite, much as the
statement that the passage of steam over heated metals will give metallic oxides
expresses a general chemical tendency. As both hosts and parasite are restricted in
distribution by climatic and other factors, the behaviour of Compsilura and host A,
host B (not any caterpillar) is tolerably determinate.
