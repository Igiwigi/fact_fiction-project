Then, after demagnetisation, a different
load was put on, another curve of magnetisation taken by again applying magnetising
force, and s0 on. The magnetising force was applied gradually and continuously by
' means of the slide described in $ 18, and the magnetisation was observed by the
| direct magnetometric method. Tn fact, as regards measurement of magnetism and
field, the conditions of each experiment .were identical with those under which the
changes of magnetisgm were caused by changing loads in a constant field, and the

methods of experiment.
