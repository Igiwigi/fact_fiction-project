to produce marked reaction upon the left side. Of the right arm the elbow and palm
of the hand react readily, the back of the fore-arm hardly at all, the back of the
upper arm only slightly, Reaction is also obtained by stimulating in the axillary and
pectoral regions.

«There is distinct muscular paresis of both right limbs, but more of the arm than
of the leg.


ON THE FUNCTIONS OF THE CEREBRAL CORTEX. 43

“There is hemiopia; objects on the right side of the mesial plane not being seen.”
This is accounted for by the fact that the interference with the occipital lobe which
occurred in the two later operations produced, as the post-mortem examination
showed, extensive softening of that portion of the brain.

The superficial extent of the lesions is represented in fig. 39.

Lesion.—A. cut was made along the anterior two-thirds of the right gyrus
fornicatus, and the grey matter of the convolution was completely scooped away.
The post-mortem examination showed that the marginal gyrus was also slightly
injured, especially in the prefrontal region, and there were some small patches of
softening on the external surface which had probably been caused by the drawing
