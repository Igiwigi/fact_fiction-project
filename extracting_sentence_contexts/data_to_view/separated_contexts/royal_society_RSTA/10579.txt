Could we
obtain a sample of the incandescent gas from near the base of the flash-spectrum layer
and examine it close at hand with a slit spectroscope, it is certain that the relative
intensities would differ widely from those in the flash spectrum as observed at an
eclipse, and it is possible that they would be found to correspond much more closely
with the relative intensities in the Fraunhofer spectrum. From the foregoing considerations it is clear that the emission lines from the lowest

& levels of the flash layer must be very difficult to observe, however bright they may be
% intrinsically. The wide divergence between the flash and Fraunhofer spectra, with
= respect to intensities, would appear, therefore, to afford no ground for abandoning the
2 original interpretation of the flash proposed by Professor Youn from his observation
&# in 1870, and the evidence of these photographs certainly indicates that the flash
= does, in fact, represent the upper, more diffused portion of a true reversing stratum.
6 In the flash-spectrum photograph (No. 3) fifteen elements can be identified with
certainty in the lower chromosphere, in addition to hydrogen and helium, and there
od are three elements doubtfully represented.
