The effect is
due to the evaporation of the nitrous acid from the exposed wire (1937.). I may
perhaps return to it hereafter, but wish at present only to give notice of the precau-
tion that is required in consequence, namely, to retain the immersed wires undisturbed
during the experiment.

1849. Proceeding on the facts made known by ScaaNBEIN respecting the relation
of iron and nitric acid, I used that acid as the fluid in a voltaic circuit formed with
iron and platinum. Pare nitric acid is s0 deficient in conducting power (1817.) that
it may be supposed capable of stopping any current due to the effect of contact be-
tween the platinum and iron ; and it is further objectionable in these experiments, be-
cause, acting feebly on the iron, it produces a chemically excited current, which may
be considered as mingling its effect with that of contact: whereas the object at pre-
sent is, by excluding such chemical action, to lay bare the influence of contact alone.
