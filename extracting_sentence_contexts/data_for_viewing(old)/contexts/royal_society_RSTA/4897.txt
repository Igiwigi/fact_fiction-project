If heating power P were generated by magnetic field lines undergoing topological changes, i.e.
reconnection, at a rate @, then the ratio of these rates, P/ @, would have units of electric current.
The foregoing showed examples where that relation arose from an actual current in the coronal
magnetic field. In those examples, the reconnection electric field does electromagnetic work on
the plasma at a rate P = 1Â®. This is how magnetic reconnection might heat the solar corona.

From that basic scenario, we derived scaling laws quantifying the heat that could arise as
magnetic elements move randomly over the photosphere, and coronal reconnection occurs to
keep the field there from becoming excessively tangled. The process described is, at its root, the
same one used by Parker to arrive at the reconnection heat flux, Fy ~ UpnB? tan, for field lines
pushed to an angle @ from their potential state [25]. Indeed, the relation found here for quiet
Sun heating, equation (4.8), has the same scaling. In our expression, however, Bis the density of
small-scale flux elements, rather than a vertical magnetic field strength. In point of fact, we tacitly
assume the concentrations have local field strength B. >> B in order that they be distinct entities.
Notably, the local field strength does not enter our estimate of heating, since heating is assumed
to occur in the corona rather than within the photospheric concentration.

Expression (4.8), and its interpretation, matches the one derived by Longcope &
Kankelborg [26] under the consideration of interacting mixed-polarity magnetic elements. That
earlier derivation used an interaction model in which sources disconnected from an overlying
background field in order to reconnect with one another [27]. The derivation proposed here
assumes only that sources exchange flux across current sheets created through their binary
interaction.

We recognize that coronal currents have different origins in ARs than in the quiet Sun: the
