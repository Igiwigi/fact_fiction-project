Shearts, gives branches to the aorta and one of its divisions ; on each of these branches
appears a small ganglion. It is possible that on further and more minnte scrutiny
Splexuses on the great vessels at least may be discovered.

S After this d-tailed account of such a complicated system of visceral nerves, few
-Eperhaps will be disposed to doubt that we have here a true sympathetic nervous
Zayatem. The fact, however, of the existence of ganglia and intercommunicating
erves forming plexuses, the mode of dispoxition of these networks upon the organs,
-Ztheir connections with the principal nervous centres grouped around the cesophagus,
Zand lastly, the microscopic structure of both nerves and ganglia, all combine to prove
Sthe correctness of what we have advanced.
S Assuming it, then, as proved that the system before us is a true sympathetic or
Splanchnic nervous system, let us now see what light this new fact is capable of
Ethrowing upon the physiology of the ganglia about the cesophagus. Although
Ehitherto physiologists have seemed to concur in the belief that s0mehow or other the
=; ons centres preside at the same time over the functions of both animal and
S S organic life, still there have been differences of opinion as to the mode of the assign-
Ement to the individual ganglia of functions apparently s0 different in nature as those
Aof the cerebro-spinal and sympathetic systems. The principal theories to be met
with are three; first, that all the ganglia, both those above and those below the
c&sophagus of the Mollusca, perform in s8ome way or other the entire functions of
cerebro-spinal and sympathetic systems ; second, that the supra-cesophageal ganglia
represent the cerebro-spinal, and the infra-cesophageal the sympathetic system of the
Vertebrata; third, that whilst the two series of ganglia in the Mollusca are the
counterparts of nearly all the cerebro-spinal in the Vertebrata, the nerves lying along
