horizontal lines, may also be expressed by radii in this system of polar co-ordinates.

It may be noted that the initial line, if taken from the basion, will be found to
pass through the auditory meatus, or rather through its orthographic projection on
the plan of the profile ; again, if such an initial line be produced as far as the cranial
vault, it will afford one of the most consistent measures of the cranial height.

It would be reasonable, when the upper jaw is taken into account, to take a fresh
centre, that, namely, of the whole skull instead of that of the cranium only: I find
upon experiment, however, that the Substitution is of no practical importance.

On the whole I think this method gives the clearest, simplest, and most complete
expression to the facts, and with greater fairness than any other. A comparison of
the eight Australian skulls made by means of it is given in fig. 9.

But whatever opinion we may form as to the relative value of these various
methods of representation, it will probably be admitted that they are each and all
preferable to any based on the glabella-inion line, so that we may safely make use
of them in studying the behaviour of the inial point. The eight profiles belong to
a natural series, of which No. 998 is the lowest member; the two others which make
the closest approach to this are numbered 999 and 1001; 999 is indeed very nearly
allied, though it would scarcely appear to be so if the calotte alone were compared
on the glabella-inion base.

On examination of figs. 6 and 7, it will be seen that the inia are for the most i
