other substance which the ferruretted chyazate is known ty
precipitate, then it is necessary to 'separate such svbstance by
the usual means, before the' application of this test for iron. With the knowledge of 'these facts, therefore, it is easy
always to obtain correct results, which will best appear by
assuming‚Äù a case particularly unfayourable for the purpose,
and shewing how the difficulties of that case may be ob-
viated. Let it therefore be supposed that the analyst has a solution
having a considerable excess of nitromuriatic acid and: con-
taining oxide of iron, barytes, alumine, magnesia, and oxide
of copper, and that he wishes to precipitate the iron by the
ferruretted chyazate of potash. If he first throw down the
barytes by a sulphate, then the other earths and oxides by
ammonia, adding an excess of ammonia to redissolve "the
oxide of copper, if he then separate the alumine by diges-
tion in caustic potash, and redissolve the oxide of iron and
magnesia in an acid, which for the sake of increasing the dif-
ficulty may again be supposed to be the nitromuriatic; I say
then, that by neutralizing any very great excess of acid, and
adding some acetite of potash in order that the unavoidable
excess of acid may be the acetic instead of the nitromuriatic;
then applying the ferruretted chyazate of potash, taking care
that there be but little, if any, excess of it added; he may
safely boil the liquid and readily collect by the filter, or by
subsidence, *the' ferruretted chyazate of per-oxide of iron,
which when properly washed, dried; and weighed, will indi-
cate very accurately the quantity of iron that was in the solu-
tion, by reckoning that quantity as 34.255 of per-oxide, for
every 100 parts of Prussian blue obtained.


termed triple Prussiates. 54.1

The succinates and benzoates which have been proposed as
superior tests for determining the quantity of iron, to the fer-
ruretted chyazates, I consider to be in general very inferior to
them, because they do not precipitate the iron, when it is in
the state of protoxide, which the latter do, and because they
precipitate alumine more effectually than those salts.
