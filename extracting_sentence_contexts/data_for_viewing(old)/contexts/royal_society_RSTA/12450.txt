pA =0, [PUr]}.,=0.

Substituting now from equation (27), § 55 for ¢’, we see that this means that there
is equilibrium owing to the simultaneous existence of three stresses: (1) the
ordinary elasticity theory stress, owing to terms which only involve Y; (2) the stress
which is independent of /, and, therefore, depends only on electromagnetic quantities ;
(3) a stress due to terms in /,, which involve both W and electromagnetic quantities.
When these last are linear in V, the resulting stvess will depend, like the second, upon
electromagnetic quantities only. If not linear, they will depend both upon W and the
electromagnetic quantities. It is quite possible that there should be no strain at all,
and yet a very sensible stress due to electromagnetic actions.

In fact, in solving the elasticity problem—having given the distribution throughout
the field, of dielectric displacements, of currents, and of magnetisation, required the strain
at any point—the only way in which the electromagnetic data can be used is, by
finding the force per unit volume and surface respectively due to them, and then
treating these forces as external. That is, the knowledge of the stress which produces
the mechanical effects of electromagnetism is of no use in discovering the strain
actually resulting; all the knowledge we can thus utilise is that of the forces (per
unit volume and surface) due to such stresses. This shows that, to find the true
expression for / it is not sufficient to investigate experimentally what strain accom-
panies a given displacement, or current, or magnetisation at a point.* The problem
is much more complicated. The shapes of all the bodies present must be assumed of
quite as great importance as the electromagnetic quantities in deciding the form of 1
from such experiments.
