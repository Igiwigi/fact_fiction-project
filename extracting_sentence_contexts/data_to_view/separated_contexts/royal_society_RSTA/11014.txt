For he argues from his conclusion that the phase increases continuously from the
origin that :

“The phenomena which point to a finite rate of propagation must in the case
of these interferences + make themselves felt even close to the oscillator. This was
indeed apparent in the experiments, and therein lay the advantage of this kind of
interference. But, contrary to the experiment, the apparent velocity near to the
oscillator comes out greater than at a distance from it . . .”t

As a matter of fact, the alterations in the velocity of transmission of either magnetic
wave or transverse component electric wave are very complex in the neighbourhood
of the oscillator, and these variations do not bear a simple relation to the points of
zero phase, from which points Hertz assumes the outward moving wave to start. Something of the difficulties Herrz met with in his experiments on “interferences of
the second kind” made close to the oscillator may well have been due to this com-
plexity of result arising from the use of a damped wave-train. IV.
