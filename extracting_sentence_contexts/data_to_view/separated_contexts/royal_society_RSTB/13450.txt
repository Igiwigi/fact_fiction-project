This result is in contrast to Gurerk et al. [52], which
establishes an experimental superiority of punishment insti-
tutions over reputational mechanisms for the public goods
game and poses doubts about whether this result can be
extended to experiments where the OPGG is played. It should be noted that all strategies with cooperation as
the main action are selected in the ecosystem for this set-
up, and in remarkably similar proportions. This follows
from the fact that they always act as cooperators in a strongly
cooperative environment, thus becoming indistinguishable
from each other (thereby avoiding selection). Our results qualify the findings of the experimental litera-
ture on anti-social punishment [24,53,54]. Such contributions
work with designs that rigidly separate individual choices
about actions and punishments from reputational concerns.
