feel no hesitation in believing that the latter 1nust submit to them also. Such being
the case, I can have no doubt that, assuming hydrogen as 1, and dismissing 8mall
fractions for the simplicity of expression, the equivalent number or atomic weight of
oxygen is 8, of chlorine 36, of bromine 78:4, of lead 103:5, of tin 59, &c., notwith-
standing that a very high authority doubles seyeral of these numbers.

\ 13. On the absolute quantity of Electricity associated with the particles or atoms of
Matter.

852. The theory of definite electrolytical or electro-chemical action appears to me
to touch immediately upon the absolute quantity of electricity or electric power be-
longing to different bodies. It is impossible, perhaps, to speak on this point without
committing oneself beyond what present facts will sustain ; and yet it is equally im-
possible, and perhaps would be impolitic, not to reason upon the subject. Although we
know nothing of what an atom is, yet we cannot resist forming some idea of a small
particle, which represents it to the mind ; and though we are in equal, if not greater,
ignorance of electricity, 80 as to be unable to say whether it is a particular matter or
matters, or mere motion of ordinary matter, or some third kind of power or agent, yet
there is an immensity of facts which justify us in believing that the atoms of matter
are in some way endowed or ass0ciated with electrical powers, to which they owe their
most striking qualities, and amongst them their mutual chemical affinity. As 800n
as we perceive, through the teaching of Darrox, that chemical powers are, however
yaried the circumstances in which they are exerted, definite for each body, we learn
to estimate the relative degree of force which resides in such bodies: and when upon
that knowledge comes the fact, that the electricity, which we appear to be capa-
