The feeble traces of colorific power aboye noticed might become
exalted by the use of other combinations, which it therefore became extremely inter-
esting to vary in every possible way. Mr. TaLBor has already observed, that in copy-
ing, photographically, designs on coloured glass, the red portions would occasionally
impart a corresponding tint to the impression of that particular portion of the design
80 coloured. The rationale of this fact, as will afterwards appear, is s01newhat more
complex than it would seem to be on perusing the experiment just cited. The bright
red yarieties of coloured glass by no means transmit the red rays in a state of purity;
and those varieties which do $0 or nearly $0, are incapable of producing the effect in
question, if the paper be fresh prepared and completely free from all traces of pre-
vious photographic action. At the moment, however, the direct explanation seemed
satisfactory, and proved an incentive to further inquiry.
