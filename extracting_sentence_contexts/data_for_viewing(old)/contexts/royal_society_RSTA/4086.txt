the sedimentation of BslA flakes formed from the decaying air bubbles.

(ii) Compression of BsIA films in a Langmuir trough creates macroscopic tubular structures and wrinkled
sheets

To investigate the properties of a BslA film at an air—water interface further, we performed
experiments in a Langmuir trough where BslA was applied to a MilliQ water subphase. In these
experiments, Bs|A was applied to the surface of the water phase and allowed to equilibrate for
varying lengths of time. In Langmuir trough experiments, the surface pressure is measured; this
is the change in surface tension owing to the addition of the surfactant (JT = yp — y, where yo is
the surface tension of the bare interface). Resulting /T-area isotherms are shown in figure 7a for
several different equilibration times. We found that, for increasing equilibration times, the change
in 7 occurs at larger and larger areas. This is due to the fact that BslA, while applied directly to the
interface, is soluble in water and some of the protein will be lost to the subphase upon application.
The larger areas at which the change in /7 occurs are simply caused by the protein that was
initially lost to the bulk during application diffusing back to the interface. This is one reason why
trying to obtain a mean molecular area measurement for a soluble surfactant is not reliable. For the
1h equilibration isotherm, we note that, when IT ~ 55 mN m_~!, there is a turnover in the isotherm
which indicates the point of film buckling or failure. We observed wrinkles or deformations on
the surface of the film at this turnover point in the isotherm. Observationally, the buckling occurs
in parallel and close to the barriers. Furthermore, we found that, with increasing equilibration
times, the surface pressure at the buckling instability decreases. Therefore, the failure pressure
depends upon the amount of protein at the interface. A very similar result is found for HFBII
