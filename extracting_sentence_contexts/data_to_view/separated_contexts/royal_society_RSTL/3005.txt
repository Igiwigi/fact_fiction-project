To the geologist, the results of such an inquiry may be of interest, as tending
to identify the products of the ancient seas in their most minute particulars
with those of the present ocean : and to the physician it may be an object of
curiosity, to speculate how far the unexplained virtues attributed to certain
mineral waters depend on the presence of these- ingredients, the energy of
whose action may perhaps compensate for the minute quantity in which they
are found. I confess, indeed, that with regard to the former of them, Todine,
we ought to be sceptical as to any medicinal agency that can be exerted by s0
small a quantity as a single grain diffused through ten gallons of water, the
largest proportion in which I have ever detected it. But with respect- to the

absurd to trace the medical yirtues ascribed to 8uch waters as those of Ashby-

bromate of magnesia (if such be the combination) in each pint of the water ;
and that the proportion would not fall far short of that, my experiments on this
particular spring seem to warrant me in concluding.
