These criteria,
and these alone, determine whether a paper is finally accepted for publication, although we
often ask for stylistic changes for reasons of clarity. The peer-review system that we use is generally regarded as the best guarantee that pub-
lished papers meet high scientific standards. The system was, in fact, introduced by the
Council of The Royal Society at its meeting of 1 March 1664, when this journal was estab-
lished. At that meeting, it was decided that papers published in Philosophical Transactions
should first be reviewed by members of the Society. This is the first recorded instance of
the peer-review system, which is now used by virtually all scientific and learned journals.
