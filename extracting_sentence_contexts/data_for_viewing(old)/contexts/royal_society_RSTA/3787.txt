is, of course, not exclusive to microfluidics and is in fact one of the many mechanisms inducing
topology changes in fluid mechanics, turning a macroscopic volume of liquid into a collection
of fragments via a more or less intricate sequential cascade of breakups [5]. As such, this field
has been widely studied and finds use in a variety of applicative settings, e.g. combustion, inkjet
printing, etc.

We now turn to a second example described in this section, the in-fibre fabrication of spherical
particles obtained by harnessing the Plateau—Rayleigh instability [79]. This example illustrates
the practical potential and the modelling challenges of instability-mediated fabrication pathways.
The technique relies on the drawing of a preform into a thin multi-material fibre constituted of
a cylindrical metalloid core, e.g. silicon, encased in a cladding [79]. The fibre is continuously
fed to a heat source, which liquifies the inner core, while the cladding retains its structural
integrity. As evident from figure 18e, the core-cladding interface is subject to the Rayleigh—
