The tubes I feel sure
are not properly a construction at all. Many Mycetophilid larvae are covered with
slimy silk they are constantly emitting. The matter emitted by Diadocidia appears
to be of a more silky and less slimy nature than usual, and I imagine that to this
fact and to the adhesion to the wood and possibly to some peculiarity in the integu-
ment of the larva the tubular form taken by its emitted matter is due.”

“ The larva frequently rests in the anterior part of the tube and protrudes its small
head, moving it from side to side and touching the wood but making no movement
that looks like the prehension of food. When alarmed it will dart rapidly along the
tube as already stated, but usually its movement is a deliberate glide made apparently
without any effort. The posterior part of the body is sometimes apparently exerted
from the tube and when again withdrawn it leaves a prolongation of the smear
behind it.
