But, it will be shown, the dark-bordered fibres
<V differ 80 very much in diameter, that some of the thinnest are s0 very fine as scarcely to
= be distinguishable with very high powers, and in parts they very closely resemble some
5 of the 80-called pale fibres. In young animals the fibres corresponding to the dark-bor-
dered fibres closely resemble the pale fibres of fully formed animals. In no tissue has
it been more confidently stated that nerves terminate in free ends than in voluntary
muscle; and although some differences of opinion exist as to the precise manner in which
the nerves end, the existence of these ends is supported by the testimony of 80 many
obseryers, that it is now almost regarded as an anatomical fact which is settled beyond
question. Yet it may be aid that, as plexuses, loops, and networks ® of yery fine fibres in young

* In using the term network, T do not mean to imply that fine nerve-fibres unite with each other after
the manner of capillaries, but merely that the bundles of fibres are arranged like networks.
