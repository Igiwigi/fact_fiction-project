The changes in the direction of the horizontal needle are
dependant on those which would take place, under the same
circumstances, in the direction of a needle freely suspended
by its centre of gravity, in such a manner that, if we conceive
their centres to coincide, and the disturbing force to act upon
the dipping needle alone, the horizontal needle would always
be found in the vertical plane passing through this imaginary

act at places where the dips are different, the sines of the

# I first stated this law of the dependance of the deviations of the horizontal needle
on those of the dipping needle, in the form of an hypothesis, in the Cambridge Philo»
5ophical Transactions for 1820 ; but without adverting to that hypothesis, it may be
considered as a most convenient method of embracing in one view, various phenomena
observed with the horizontal needle. From whatever cause deviation in the direction
of the horizontal needle may have arisen, except, possibly, in cases where the length
of the needle bore a very sensible ratio to the distance of the disturbing body, I have
met with no instance that was not quite consistent with this law ; nor was I aware that
any 8uch was said to exist, until I heard the circumstance stated in a paper of Mr. Baz-
Low”'s, recently read before the Royal Society, Not being in possession of Mr,BarLow's
experimental results, however far I may be from being convinced by the arguments
he has adduced against the law itself, independent of any hypothetical views, I will
not venture to point out the nature of their fallacy : but as far as I could collect the
facts during the reading of the paper, I am of opinion that they would result from
my view of the subject. Thus supposing the centre of the $hell, in his experiments,
to be placed in the equator of the imaginary dipping needle passing through the
centre of the horizontal needle, 80 that, if the branches of this needle were of equal
intensity, no deviation would, according to my view, take place ; then, if either
branch be deteriorated, the centre or pivot of the needle will no longer be the centre
of its magnetism, and a point in the horizontal needle, remote from its pivot, must
now be considered as the centre of the dipping needle ; and the centre of the shell
being now above, or below the equator of this dipping needle, according to the cir-
cumstances of deterioration, unequal action will take place on the branches of the
dipping needle, and consequently, according to the law in question, deviation of the
horizontal needle will ensue, Although this law has been called in question, I will
here mention an instance of its advantage in connecting different phenomena. By
supposing the effect of a disturbing force to be produced on the dipping needle, and
that in consequence the poles describe, in a certain time, a circle round their un-
disturbed places, connecting the observations on the dip, in this manner, with those
on the horizontal needle, I found, as I have stated in my paper in the Cambridge
Philosophical Tranzsactions, 1820, that the resulting variations will agree, within
less than half a degree, with the observed variations of the horizontal needle in

London, during a period of 200 years.
