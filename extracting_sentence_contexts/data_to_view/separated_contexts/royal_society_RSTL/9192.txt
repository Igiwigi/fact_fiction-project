In a letter to * Nature ' (Dec. 20, 1877) I have drawn attention to the fact that
the lower temperature spectrum of oxygen seems to be reversed in the swn, and I
have tried to bring this fact into connexion with the statement made by Professor
DRAPER, that the higher temperature lines of oxygen appear bright on the solar disc. T have now nothing to add to what I have stated in my letter to © Nature,” and only
give the lis of the exact wave-lengths of the compound line spectrum, together with
the wave-lengths of the nearest solar lines. l
Oxygen.
