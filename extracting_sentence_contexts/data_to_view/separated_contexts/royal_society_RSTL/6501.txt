Hence we see
that the 8um of the moments about Or of the moving forces of which m det (D(Q), R)

is the type is A m_ and that this follows from the properties of principal axes, and from

: . dos;
the fact that the component of D,(Q) parallel to the axis of & is __ In the second place, we have already seen in section 30 of Chapter II. that the
moment about the axis of x of det (Q, V) equals â€”r#v, cos @, v, being the component of
V, and 9 the angle between the radius vector and V.
