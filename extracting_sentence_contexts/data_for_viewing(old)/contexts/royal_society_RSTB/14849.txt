Figure 7. (a) Variation in the probabilistic classification score from classification baseline, obtained with the occlusion sensitivity analysis with three instances from
the test dataset. The red areas indicate a reduction in the recognition ability of the model when a particular location is occluded, while the blue areas indicate the
opposite. The colour bars indicate the appropriate probabilistic scale for each instance. (b) Average of the occlusion analysis in the KDEF dataset projected on the
relevant AKDEF images. (c) Example of bubbles analysis on three subjects from the test dataset. (d) Example of bubbles analysis on a single subject from the KDEF
dataset among the three categories. (e) Average bubbles result by category, projected on the relevant AKDEF dataset images (female AKDEF shown).
