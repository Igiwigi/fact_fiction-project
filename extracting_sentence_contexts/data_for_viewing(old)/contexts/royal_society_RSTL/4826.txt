The percentage of the platinum is unusually low when compared with the theore-
tical value, a fact which I suppose is due to the recrystallization of the salt. In
several cases I have observed that the platinum-salts of these bases undergo a slight
decomposition under these circumstances, which is not indicated by the appearance
of the recrystallized salt, but which is invariably pointed out by a diminution of the
amount of platinum. I am not as yet acquainted with the mode of this change. In
the present instance I have not repeated the experiment, because the mode of form-
ation, the analysis of the iodide, and moreover the decomposition of the base, preclude
all doubts respecting the formula of the compound under examination.

The remarkable change exhibited by oxide of tetrethylammonium, when submitted
to the action of heat, necessarily induced me to study the deportment of the amylo-
triethylated base under similar cireumstances. This study appeared to promise s0me
farther revelations respecting the molecular constitution of this body, a hope in which
