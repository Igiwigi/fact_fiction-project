Hence it
is more than an aside to note that what environmental historians and scientists have dubbed the
‘great acceleration’ [23] that transformed Western economies and societies was not just televised:
it made television the culturally powerful medium that it is today. The explosive expansion of
TV set ownership, the advertising industry, the advent of colour television and the increase of
material demand in the second half of the twentieth century were all closely interrelated. The
travel and home improvement strands of the emergent genre of factual entertainment were
prominent examples of the ways in which hydrocarbons, technology and increased earnings
across the middle and working classes were combining to offer new freedoms, life choices
and experiences. Documentary and factual magazine shows followed the changing nature of
technology, work, community and home life. They were frequently presented with a celebratory
tone.
