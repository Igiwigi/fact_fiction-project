cloud cleared the grafts appeared to be fused.

In nine cases the mass became bright red, the outline remained definite (figure 16,
plate 28), and healthy vascular thyroid with splenic tissue was found on subsequent
histological examination (figure 18, plate 28).

In the remaining six cases the mass gradually decreased in size and its outline became
progressively less definite. Subsequent histological examination showed disintegrating
splenic tissue with either no trace of thyroid (five cases) or a few thyroid acini embedded
in connective tissue (one case).

The proportion of successful thyroid grafts was thus considerably higher than in the
previous experiment and, in fact, does not differ significantly from that found in experi-
ment I, 2 (i) (a) (uncomplicated thyroid homografts to the anterior chamber after total
thyroidectomy).

Thus making this comparison we have 9 successes out of 15 as against 40 out of 51, for
which y?=2-16, P=0-15.

The explanation of these results seems reasonably clear.

It appears from experiments IV, 3 and IV, 5 that splenic and thyroid grafts from the
same donor are not intrinsically incompatible, i.e. they are able to survive side by side
without either affecting the other adversely, and the low survival rate of the thyroid grafts
in experiment IV, 4 must therefore be related to the fact that in this experiment the
