and consequently every slight change of the screw-collar of an adjusting objective pro-
duces comparatiyely a very large displacement in the final focal image, and therefore of
the traversing image-searcher ; 80 that the searcher-traverse represents a movement
conjugate with the objective index. Again, since this traverse towards the objective
encounters rays of increasing divergence, an increasing breadth of pencil is encountered
by the lenses of the searcher, and its own peculiar aberration receives an instantaneous
increase, which introduces an important new element in definition, it having been ob-
served that the glasses must be very gradually overcorrected as the image is formed
nearer the objective, within the tube of the microscope.

* I may bo permitted to add a note here (Nov. 7, 1870), that a Wray one-fifth, made expressly, admitted of
as great amplification as an ordinary one-twelfth. In fact these researches appear to point decisively to greater
adyantages to be expected from raising the quality of the lower objectives rather than deepening focal length.
Obseryers are more numerous every year who prefer the 00e-eighth to the one-twenty-fifth and one-fiftieth.
