A comparison of the analytical data furnished by our examination of the products of
explosion of gunpowder with those obtained by BUuxsEN and SCHISCHKOFP and other
recent investigators of this subject, points to the following principal differences in the
results arrived at :—

As regards the gascous products: the proportion of carbonic oxide is considerably
lower in BUNSEN and SCHISCHKOFP's analysis and in one of KAROLYT's than in the results
obtained by us; this might, in the case of BuxsEN and SCHISHKOFPPF'S Tesults, be ascribed
to the fact that the proportion which the xaltpetre bears to the carbon in the English
powder is lower than in the powder used by them, and that the proportion of 8ulphur
is also lower, The Austrian cannon-powder employed by KaroLy1, which is not widely

Q different from the English cannon (R. L. G.) powder, as regards the proportion of salt-
N petre and carbon, though containing a higher proportion of sulphur, furnished amounts
5 of carbonic anhydride and carbonic oxide more nearly approaching those obtained with
ly the English powder at a low pressure. But the other (small-arms) powder used by him
£ furnished almost as low an amount of carbonic oxide as obtained by BUNSEN and Scniscn-
i) KOFF, although the proportion of saltpetre to the carbon in this powder was about the
S same as in the other used by him. This result may be ascribable to the smaller propor-
5 tion of sulphur existing in the former. The Wiirtemburg powder used by Lixck, which
EZ was made apparently with a very highly burned charcoal, but contained a similar propor-
