each case become a pedicle s0 narrow that it can only be obseryed with great difficulty.
Â© It is fairly certain that by this stage each posterior nerve-rudiment has its own
S 8eparate and independent junction with the spinal cord; their dorsal extremities are
S nevertheless probably connected with each other by a continuous commissure.
A The cells composing the rudiments are still round, and have, in fact, undergone no
important modifications since the last stage.

The important feature of the section figured (fig. D b), and one which it shares with
the other sections of the 8ame embryo, is the appearance of connective-tissue cells around
the nerve-rudiment. 'These cells arise from two sources; one of these is 8upplied by
the vertebral rudiments, which at the end of the last stage (Plate 16. fig. C, vr) become
split off from the inner layer of the muscle-plates. The vertebral rudiments have
in fact commenced to grow up on each side of the neural canal, in order to form the
mass of cells out of which the neural arches are subsequently developed.

The dorsal extremities of the muscle-plates form the second source of these con-
nectiye-tissue cells. These latter cells lie dorsal and external to the nerve-rudiments.

the possibility of erroneous interpretations in the previous stages of the Pristiurus-
embryo.
