Fig. 5, Plate 24, gives
the two curves, the maximum of the normal curve being taken as 100. G's prin-
cipal defect is evidently in the red; in fact, when he matched the luminosity in the
part of the spectrum near C with the candlelight, to our eyes, the shadow illumined
by the spectrum was a brilliant red, whilst that illumined by the candle was nearly
black. There may be a very slight falling off in the blue-green, which on the
trichromatic theory can be accounted for by a light want of sensitiveness in the
© blue-perceiving ” nerves. Apparently, also, his perception of violet is not normal.
