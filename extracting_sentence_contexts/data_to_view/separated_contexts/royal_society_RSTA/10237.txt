The curves given in fig. 10, showing the relation between current and potential at
various low pressures in air, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide, are all readily under-
stood if we remember that the mean free path of the corpuscles in hydrogen is, from
the kinetic theory of the gases, about twice that in air or carbon dioxide, and that a
lower potential difference is required to start ionisation by collision in hydrogen
than in the other gases. The curves of figs. 11 and 12 obtained after substitution for the zine of a

SX platinum electrode are similar to those obtained using the zine electrode, except
% that at the lower potential differences the currents in hydrogen are slightly greater
8 than those in air, whereas the opposite was the case with the zinc.

2 The currents in air, hydrogen and carbon dioxide were also compared using an
A aluminium electrode. The results obtained were identical in their general character
= with those obtained using zine, though the sensitiveness of the aluminium was much
6 smaller than that of the zinc.

2 From the curves of fig. 13 we see that the currents in carbon monoxide, using a

2) zine electrode, are some 20 per cent. less than in air, being in fact almost the same
<7 as those in hydrogen until the potentials used are great enough to cause ionisation
8 by collision, which sets in in air and carbon monoxide at about the same potential
& gradient.

3 Experiments have been carried out on the photo-electric effect in certain less
4 simple gases, such as marsh gas and benzene vapour. The results obtained are
S complicated by the very large absorption of the ultra-violet light in its passage

ig through the gas, and are being further investigated.
