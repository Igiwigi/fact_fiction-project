My reference to the blood of the Paco thus appeared to decide against an
essential correspondence in form between the cellzeform nucleus of the nucleated cell
and the © red corpuscle.” A little further study of the blood of the Paco however
800n cleared away this apparent difficulty, and showed me a state of things more
corroborative of my view regarding the nature of the © red corpuscle,” and in mnch
closer correspondence with analogy perhaps than would have been that which I sup-
posed possible. I discovered, in fact, corpuseles in different stages of transition, from
the circular form similar to that of the cellzeform nucleus within the nucleated cell,
to the oval form of the perfect © red corpuscle;” and I also discovered that in these
different stages of transition in respect of form there are different degrees of colora-
tion (figs. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.) .
