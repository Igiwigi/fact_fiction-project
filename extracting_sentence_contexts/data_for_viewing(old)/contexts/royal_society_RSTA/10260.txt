* Of. Zsigmonpy, ‘ Zeitschr. f. Electrochem.,’ p. 547. Brepia’s remark, that his gold solutions were /ue
red, points to the same conclusion.

+ These curves show that in each case the absorption is less for red than for yellow. This is contrary
to statements made in the previous paper (loc. cif., pp. 399 and 420); the errors therein made were due to
miscalculation for silver (red) (loc. cit., Table L., p. 396).

{ The cause of the depression of the observed maximum below those calculated is doubtless to be found
in the fact, to which Lord Ray.eicu has called attention in a recent lecture at the Royal Institution, that
