It
may be here remarked that the complete obliteration recorded by the photographs
with the large Rowland grating are not entirely confirmed by photographs with a
1 m. grating. These latter sometimes show faint indications of lines under high
pressures where none are apparent in those taken by the 21} feet instrument. This
is due to the fact that the lines do appear in the spectrum under pressure at the
moment of extinction of the arc, and possibly at the moment of striking it
(cf: p. 44). With large dispersion the duration of these lines is insignificant compared with the
total length of exposure necessary to affect the plate, but when the dispersion is
smaller the exposure is less, and the interval during which the lines shine out is
comparable with the total exposure necessary. The lines to vanish first are those of the 1st subordinate series (a, \ = 4055°44
and ¢, \ = 4212°1), which are of great intensity at normal pressure.
