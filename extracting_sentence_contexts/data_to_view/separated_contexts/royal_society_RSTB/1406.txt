Now as regards the general morphology, the simple leaves, arranged
many members, form an obvious point of resemblance to Hquisetum,
specimens of Calamites showing structure, we can, indeed, only infer the
the leaves from that of the outgoing vascular bundles; the macroscopic .
however, leave no doubt as to the facts.*

On the other hand, it is quite certain that the leaves were separate, not
to form a sheath, as in Hqguisetum. Further, the alternation of the
successive whorls was less constant in Calamites than in the recent genus. â€”

The branches of the stem in Equisetum are alternate with the leaves of #
in the axil of which they arise. This agrees substantially with the position o
branches in Calamites (see Plate 72, photographs 5 and 6, Plate 80, fig. 21), j
relation of the vascular bundles to those of the main stem seems also to ag
two genera, but this will be considered below.
