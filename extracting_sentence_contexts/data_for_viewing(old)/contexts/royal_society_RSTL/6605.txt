It may be observed that the same proof may

of the centre of grayity and a rotation about the centre of gravity.

founded on the fact that the sum of the moments of the moving forces of the body's

fact is the reason why the equations of vis viva can be obtained by multiplying Evizr's
three equations by w,, w,, z, respectiyely, and by adding together the products 80
