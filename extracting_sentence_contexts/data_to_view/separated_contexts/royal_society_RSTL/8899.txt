In it each
3 of the disks shows a vertical central line, partly crossed by an oblique one coming from
above downwards, but which becomes very indistinct after it has reached the more
> distinct yertical one. This is the only example I have met with from the Oldham
= deposits in which a trace of the central spot s0 universal in the bordered disks of living
© Conifers is to be seen. Z These facts appear to me to justify the conclusion that the specimens described really
ES belonged to Gymnospermons plants allied to the Conifere. On comparing the sections
g of the Coalbrookdale specimen (figs. 33 & 36) with several recent forms we sce at a
& glance how close is the resemblance between them. Thus, on examining a longitudinal
© 8ection of a young branch of Tacys, we obtain an exact copy of fig. 36, the portion @
S being the liber, with its vasa propria and longitudinal resin-canals, whilst the parenchyma
5 (e) is a phelloderm layer, the cells of which, in the recent stem, are full of chlorophyl
A grains.
