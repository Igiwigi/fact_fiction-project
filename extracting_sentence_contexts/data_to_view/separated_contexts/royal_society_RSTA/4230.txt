This is
perhaps contrary to what might have been expected, since increase of tempera-
ture has been shown to hasten recovery. But although the total elongations
are greater, the process of recovery really has been aided. This is shown by the fact ©
that distinctly smaller yieldings are obtained with low loads after the bar has been
heated to 45°C. But though the bar is more perfectly elastic under low loads, under
higher ones the yielding which occurs has not been decreased ; so that, as the specimen
is subjected to a gradually increasing load, there is a transition from more elastic
behaviour to less, which is suggestive of a yield-point. To return again to Diagram No. IX., the specimen, after being warmed to 45°C. in
