place, until there is an adequate scientific basis on which to justify such activities and
appropriate consideration of the associated risks for the environment and biodiversity
and associated social, economic and cultural impacts, with the exception of small scale
scientific research studies that would be conducted in a controlled setting in accordance
with Article 3 of the Convention, and only if they are justified by the need to gather specific
scientific data and are subject to a thorough prior assessment of the potential impacts on
the environment.”

Certain scientists disapprove of the ETC Group’s activist tactics, considering themselves as well as
the wider field of climate engineering technologies to be subjects of overwrought rhetoric instead
of measured criticism. For example, the CBD’s 2010 decision is considered by the ETC Group to
be a UN-backed ‘moratorium’ [76,77], when it has been otherwise criticized for its brevity and
opaqueness, non-binding nature, inapplicability outside of biodiversity impacts and for the fact
that the USA is not a signatory [78]. Yet, the key insight here is: given the visibility and influence
of movements outside of the scientific community to govern SRM and climate engineering field
tests, scientists cannot claim control over the framing of the debate.

At the international (or intergovernmental) level, the IPCC in 2011 held a scoping meeting in
Peru to discuss the details of including climate engineering in the upcoming Fifth Assessment
Report [79], and has consequently included a discussion of climate engineering in its Working
Group I [80], with its Working Groups II and III reports still due at the time of writing. Yet,
while the IPCC reports have in the past functioned as a basis for negotiations at the UNFCCC,
this, by itself, is no definite indication that the issue will make it onto the agenda of future
UNFCCC COPs. Currently, only the CBD and the London Convention and Protocol have taken
decisions on climate engineering governance at the level of international institutions. The latter
