In working out the scattering of radiation by opaque, diffusely reflecting surfaces on an absorption
theory, LOMMEL obtains a first order approximation to the effect of self-illumination in giving rise to
deviations from Lambert’s Law of diffuse reflection, the modified formula being referred to as the
Lommel-Seeliger Law of Illumination. This problem is included as a particular case of the investigation
of the present paper. LomMet’s formula for diffuse reflection is represented in the present instance by
equation (69), which is the solution of an integral equation expressing exactly the effect of self-illumination,
MULLER points out that even LoMMEL’s modification of LamBert’s Law does not represent exactly the
results of observation on diffuse reflection ; it may happen that the more complete solution represented by
(69), adapted to the case of intense absorption, gives a better representation of fact. This point must,
however, be left over for further investigation.
