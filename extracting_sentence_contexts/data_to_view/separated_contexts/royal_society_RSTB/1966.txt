found that the muscles of a rabbit or dog did not become rigid until the temperature
reached 49° or 50° C., a temperature which, as he pointed out, corresponds with that
necessary to produce the first coagulation in the muscle-plasma of these animals,

He found further that in the case of the pigeon the temperature necessary was still
higher, viz., 53° C.

On testing mammalian muscle by the method we have described we find that it
only gives two contractions, the first commencing at 44° C, and the second at 58° C.
Mammalian muscle therefore differs from frog’s muscle in not giving a contraction
at 34° C. This exactly coincides with the fact that fresh extracts of mammalian
muscle contain no soluble myogen-fibrin, The two contractions which are obtained
correspond in their temperatures to the coagulations of the two proteids obtainable
from mammalian muscle. This is shown in fig. 4.
