Extensional review of computer systems may also be undertaken by privileged oversight
entities. It is common that the inputs and outputs of specific decisions are reviewed for
accuracy or so errors can be corrected. In fact, the right to review computer system outputs
in this way is guaranteed in laws such as in the adverse action notices of the Fair Credit
Reporting Act (FCRA) and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) in the USA, and
in the Article 13-15 rights to data access and correction in the GDPR in Europe. Beyond
individual decisions, examination of group-level system outcomes is a cornerstone of quantitative
evaluation for policy interventions of all kinds. While there are limits, courts have even
held that group-level extensional evaluation is an important approach to counteracting
discrimination [44].
