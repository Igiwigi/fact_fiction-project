In the analytical experiments, there are
probably sources of error, from the solution of a part of the
inflammable matter, and it possibly may retain alkali, which
cannot be separated by the acid. In the synthetical pro-
cess, in which washing is employed, and s0 small a quan-
tity of matter used, the results are till less to be depended
upon ; they must be considered only as imperfect approxima-
tions. From the general tenour of the facts, it appears that the
combustible matter obtained from boracic acid, bears the same
relation to that substance, as sulphur and phosphorus do to
the sulphuric and phosphoric acids. But is it an elementary

inflammable body, the pure basis of the acid ? or is it not like
sulphur and phosphorus, compounded ? Without entering into any discussjon concerning ultimate
elementary matter, there are many circumstances which favour
the idea, that the dark olive substance, is not a simple body;
its being non-conducting, its change of colour by being heated
in hydrogene gas, and its power of combining with the alka-
lies; for these properties in general belong to primary com-
pounds, that are known to contain oxygene,

I heated the olive coloured substance with potassium, there
was a combination, but without any luminous appearance, and
a gray metallic mass was formed ; but from the effect of this
upon water, I could not affirm that any oxygene had been
added to the metal, the gas given off had a peculiar smell, and
took up more oxygene by detonation than pure hydrogene,
from which it seems probable, that it held some of the com-
bustible matter in solution.
