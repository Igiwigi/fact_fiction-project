In every way save one, perhaps, the account given by LeGvar of the Solitaire of

throw any light on the subject. The rugose surface at the junction of the nasal bones
with the nasal process of the premaxillary indicates the poxition of the caruncular ridge
which he likens to a © widow's peak,” and in his figure represents at this place. The
