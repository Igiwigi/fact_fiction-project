also on the applied macroscopic stress o. Recall that o is parametrized by a stress angle ¢ in (5.5).
In this work, one of the goals is precisely to obtain a parametrized optimal geometry independent
of the applied stress. This requirement is made for simplicity or for manufacturing reasons, as
explained in [16] or [17]. The idea of the optimal design strategy in Part II [21] of our work is
to use a simple parametrized family of unit cells, thus independent of the stress tensor. For that
purpose, the optimal smoothing exponent q*(é, p, 0) has to be averaged in terms of the stress. This
averaging process should not be uniform and must take into account that the resulting cells Yo
will be used in an optimal design process. More precisely, the macroscopic structural optimization
of Part II will favour some values of (&, p) for given stress 0. For example, it is well known that for
compliance minimization the thickness of the ‘walls’ of the microstructure should be proportional
to the stress that it has to sustain in its direction. This is rigorously proved for two-dimensional
rank-2 laminates [11] and it is numerical evidence for rectangular holes in a square cell [31]. Note
that this fact is different from the optimal orientation of orthotropic materials [22] which is already
taken into account by taking 012 = 0. Intuitively, the macroscopic optimization algorithm will tend
to propose large/elongated rectangular holes when dealing with pure traction stresses and more
symmetric holes when dealing with more hydrostatic loads.

Therefore, it is likely that microstructures which have a semi-axis ratio my /m will be favoured
by the structural optimization process at places where the stress tensor ratio |o11|/|o22| has similar
values. Note that the ratio 011/022 may be positive or negative, so its absolute value is close
to m/m if @~é or 6~a —&. In other words, the average of q*(é,,) is performed with a
non-uniform weight in terms of ¢, which is proportional to how close the ratio of the principal
stresses are to the semi-axis ratio € and x — §. Then, we propose to compute the averaged optimal
smoothing exponent as follows
