INTRODUCTORY.

In 1887 my attention was directed to a curious substance, or structure, popularly
known in many parts of the country as the Ginger-beer Plant, from its association
with the domestic manufacture of the well-known summer beverage so often pur-
chased in villages and towns in various parts of the British Isles, where it is usually
put up in brown stone bottles, with tied corks. My earliest specimens of the Ginger-
beer plant were obtained from Mr. Tuisrteron Dyer, of Kew, who called my atten-
tion to its mysterious nature, and from Professor BAyLey Batrour, of Edinburgh,
then Professor of Botany in the University of Oxford, who exhibited specimens at a
meeting of the Linnean Society in 1887.* Since then I have obtained specimens
from various sources in this country and abroad; and during the progress of a long
series of investigations have elicitated a number of facts as to the constitution and
behaviour of this remarkable agent of fermentation, which, whatever their importance,
cannot fail to be of interest to all biologists.

In addition to the gentlemen. referred to, who kindly provided me with specimens
obtained from Lincolnshire, Oxfordshire, and even from North America, I have also
to thank Dr. Ransome, of Nottingham, and Mr, ApriAn Brown, of Burton-on-Trent,
for specimens from the towns referred to, and Messrs. Legere and AppLeyarn, for
further supplies from Coventry and elsewhere.

It appears that while, on the one hand, the Ginger-beer Plant has long been known
in the rural districts of this country, and even abroad, as a mysterious agent which
brings about the fermentation of saccharine solutions, to which ginger has been added,
