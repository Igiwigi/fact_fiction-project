activated in the output layer given A as input than A was
given B (figure 2f). This results from the higher activity of
B compared to A when AB is presented in training, causing
more strengthening of the weights connecting to B’s output
unit than to A’s. This is consistent with findings that the hip-
pocampus is involved in prediction rather than retrodiction
[6,7,37-39].

(ii) Representational change over time

Though the TSP does not represent regularities in the initial
response at the end of training, there is an earlier period
where it does represent them weakly, and in fact the effect
in this period is stronger in DG than CA1 (electronic sup-
plementary material, figure S1a). This occurs because the TSP
rapidly learns whatever it is exposed to, and the true pairs AB

do occur more frequently. However, as the network gains
more exposure to all transitions (BC, DA, etc.), weights max
out and the similarity for across-pair transitions fully catches
up. As B pulls away from AB and towards BC, the relatively
greater similarity for pairmates weakens. CA1’s similarity struc-
ture does not weaken over time in this way, even with extensive
training (electronic supplementary material, figure S1c,d). To
assess the impact of these TSP dynamics on the model’s behav-
