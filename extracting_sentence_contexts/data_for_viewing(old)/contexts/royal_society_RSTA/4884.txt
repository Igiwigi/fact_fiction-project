In principle, it is feasible to increase ns through RISC from high-lying triplet exciton (hot
exciton process). Recently, we developed a series of highly efficient fluorescent materials (figure 4)
according to the hot exciton principle, and ns of the FOLEDs based on these emitters greatly broke
through the theoretical limit of singlet excitons [7,8,33,34]. Particularly, employing approximately
100% excitons was obtained in a device of TPA-NZP [7,8]. Several distinct features in the excited
state energy levels of these materials render the potential hot exciton RISC pathway, as shown in
figure 5 [47]. In the case of TPA-NZP, firstly, a very large energy gap (AEs = 1.22 eV) emerged
between S; and T;, which indicated the TADF process (RISC from T; to S;) was impossible
to occur. Alternatively, it can be found that both Sz and T2 belonged to a charge-transfer (CT)
state, and a very small singlet-triplet energy splitting (AEsr =0.29 eV) existed between them.
Due to the fact that CT exciton possesses weak binding energy, correspondingly the spin flip
between singlet state and triplet state is prone to occur for the CT excitons. The combination
of the CT character of Sz and T» and their identical energy level could provide an effective
