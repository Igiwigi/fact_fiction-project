took place directly through the cells of the piliferous layer, tubes and filaments were
no longer necessary, and consequently, being organs of the plant itself, they could be,
and were, dispensed with. Throughout his work Franx insisted that the Bacteroids
are not themselves the germs, but that they contain them, and that, after the decay
and death of the tubercles, the main substance of the Bacteroids is absorbed by the
plant, whilst the contained cocci are returned to the soil.

In support of this theory Frank adduced the facts that, though he had found
Bacteroids in aérial organs of plants bearing tubercles, he utterly failed to detect
them in plants devoid of tubercles, and that Phaseolus, a genus in which he found
Bacteroids even in the cotyledons, was capable of producing tubercles even in
sterilised soils. It is very difficult to understand how such results have led Frank
to this opinion, for they appear clearly to point to the conclusion that the Bacteroids
are themselves the germs, whatever their contents may be. In this connection, too,
FRANK reports the occurrence of Bacteroids in the parenchymatous tissues of aérial
organs of lupine, pea, and bean, and in the cotyledons of the bean. I may at once
state that, in accordance with SCHNEIDER and others, I have utterly failed to confirm
these observations. In no case were Bacteroids visible in the cells of any other
organs than the tubercles themselves. In addition, although I have made repeated
attempts, using the methods which FRANK suggests, to determine the nature of the
