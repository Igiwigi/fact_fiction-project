In this case, the inclusion of UC] and
UC4 in this analysis would have had underestimated the prob-
ability of gene retention in the wider choanoflagellate clade. Thus, genome-wide comparative analyses using SAG data
need to be designed aiming to minimize the effects of incom-
pleteness biases. For example, gene family evolutionary
studies can be based on protein domains instead of full-
length genes (to take advantage of the fact that the recovery
rate of individual protein domains from SAG assemblies is
higher than for genes [34]). In addition, our comparative frame-
work complemented our SAGs with a wide array of complete
genomic and transcriptomic data from other choanoflagellates
(21 in total) [9,10,23] and other eukaryotes. By taking these
limitations into account in our experimental design, we were
able to take leverage of the limited genomic information
contained in UC1 and UC4 in two key analyses: our phyloge-
nomic analysis, which includes the widest sampling of
choanoflagellates to date (figure 2), and the reconstruction of
ancestral protein domain evolution from the LECA to the
origin of animals (figure 3).
