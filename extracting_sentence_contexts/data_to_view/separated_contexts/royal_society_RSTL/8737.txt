270 MR. G. J. ROMANES ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF MEDUSZ.

not intend to publish them on the present occasion ; but I may nevertheless be permitted
to remark, with reference to the pasage just quoted, that the conclusion 80 positively
enunciated concerning the function of the structures described has always appeared to
me, as it has appeared to biologists in general, a conclusion that is certainly unwarranted
by the facts. As the learned Professor himself insists, the cells to which he s0 confi-
dently attributes a nervous character represent © a peculiar type of the neryous system,
a type different from all those types which have yet been recognized in the animal
kingdom; ” and this fact alone, one would think, ought to have inspired extreme
caution in founding deductions upon. such a basis regarding a question of such high
importance as is that concerning the presence of a neryous system in the class Hydrozoa. Whatever effect, therefore, the present paper may have in deciding this question, or in
confirming the deductions of Prof. AGass1z, I wish to state, as emphatically as I can, that
in my opinion these deductions were decidedly premature, and that hitherto the only
legitimate attitude of mind to adopt towards the much-yexed question as to the presence
of nerves in Meduse, is that which is thus tersely formulated by one of the greatest
living authorities upon the group :—*
