But we have lately seen, that a natural combination of iron
with 36.50 or 37 per cent. of sulphur, is in possession of all the
properties supposed hitherto to appertain (in any marked degree)
almost exclusively to the well known magnetic iron, ore; and
that the combination alluded to is strictly chemical, and not (as
at first might have been imagined) a mixture of, particles of
magnetic iron ore with common pyrites,*

This is certainly very remarkable; and it induced me to exa-
mine the eſfects produced by sulphur, on the capacity of metallic

* This has been sufficiently proved, by the facts which haye been stated ;" I shall
however add, that upon digesting a mixture of the powder of common pyrites and iron
\ filings in muriatic acid, I only obtained hydrogen gas, exactly as if I had employed the
