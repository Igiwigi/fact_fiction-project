On the removal of this force the
S residual value was 6360, or 68 per cent. of the induced. This must not, however, be
| Dtaken as a measure of the percentage of residual magnetism which would have been
found had the steel been more nearly © saturated.” To remove the residual magnetisn
Za reverse force of oyer 40 units was necessary. A noticeable feature in this case is

reapplied, The © off” and © on” curyes for these operations are almost coincident.
