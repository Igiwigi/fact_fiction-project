This inclines me to consider them as forming part of one great
system of nerves, which are more of an involuntary than of a voluntary character. Of this great system the sympathetic nerves doubtless form a part, of which the
transverse nerves perhaps may be only a peculiar modification. It is a remarkable
fact, that while the musecles of the wings are supplied with nerves which in every stage
of the insect's existence originate by double roots, one of which is derived from the
motor tract of the cords before it arrives at a ganglion, and the other both from a
ganglion of the sensitive tract and from the motor tract which passes over it, they
are also supplied with large nerves from the transyerse series, as may be best seen in
the larva, long before the organs unto which they are giyen are called into activity. But this is not the case with the muscles of the legs, which are supplied only with
very minute filaments from the transverse series, in addition to their compound or
moto-sensitive nerves. The reason for this difference in the distribution of the nerves
to the wings and legs is clearly on account only of their difference of function, the
wings being more directly concerned than the legs in the acts of respiration.
