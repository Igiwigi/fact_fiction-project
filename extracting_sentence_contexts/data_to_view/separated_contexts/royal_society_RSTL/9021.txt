of the difficulty of answering this question by means of histological research, that
hitherto I have postponed the latter, and, giving priority to the method of section,
I obtained the most definite results with regard to function which it is possible for this
or for any other method to yield. (5) Bearing in mind that in an unmutilated Tiaropsis indicans the polypite invariably
