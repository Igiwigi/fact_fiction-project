by enlarging the aperture; and Pachydera (Upper Senonian and Danian) by
- acquiring the first two characters and by producing a tubular secondary aperture.
Murinopsia and Decurtaria (both Upper Senonian) are derived from advanced
Pelmatopora, both having secondary and tertiary pelmata and comparatively few
cost. Murinopsia has a distal shield in which the distal and proximal pairs of
apertural spines retain their identity, and a distal pair of avicularia which are more
or less separate from the distal shield; while in Decurtaria the apertural spines
are immersed in the distal shield which also embraces a distal pair of avicularia.

5. The Evolution of the Species.

The relationships of the species within the genera remain to be considered. There
are but few forms of the genera Pachydera, Murinopsia and Decurtaria, in fact the

last genus contains but the single species D. [Semiescharipora] cornuta (Beissel) and
therefore need not be further considered.

Pachydera contains two species: P. grandis, Marsson, from the zone of
B. mucronata of Riigen, and its derivative P. densa, Lang, from the Danian of Faxe.
Pachydera was seen to differ from Pelmatopora in haying fewer coste and a tubular
aperture; so these tendencies are intensified during evolution; and P. densa, has,
if anything, a more tubular aperture than P. grandis, typically five costee compared
