The rate of propagation is not, however, constant in the case of all earthquakes,
but the waves set up by the greatest earthquakes travel at a higher speed than

those set up by lesser ones; from this it may be concluded that the rate of propa-
gation is, in some way not yet worked out, a function of the size of the wave. 10. The rate of propagation of the waves of this phase is, in the case of great
earthquakes, higher than that which has been calculated for purely elastic surface
waves, and from this, and from the fact that their rate of propagation seems to be a
function of their size, it is probable that their propagation is, at least in part,
gravitational.
