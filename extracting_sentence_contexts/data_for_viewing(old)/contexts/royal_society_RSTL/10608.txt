Mineral manure. Leguminous herbage, though in less actual amount than the
A increased in much greater proportion, indeed, in a very striking degree.
'Miscellaneous plants, however, rather declined than increased.
= Although no nitrogen was supplied, there was a great increase in the amount taken
DY as compared with the produce without manure, especially by the increased legu-
Minous growth. Upon the whole, without nitrogenous manure, the amount of nitrogen
Siken up under the influence of the purely mineral manure was one and two-thirds
much as without manure, and nearly three times as much as by applying the same
Manure to either wheat or barley on arable land: Further, with this greatly increased
Yield of nitrogen in the produce, without the supply of any by manure, there was
Sound a great reduction in the percentage of nitrogen in the upper layers of the oil,
dicating the source whence the nitrogen of the vegetation had been derived.
S Bearing in mind these striking facts, we now turn to the botanical characteristics of
he mineral manured plot, as shown in Table LXVIII., pp. 1324-5.

As already referred to, it has been found that the number of species compared with
that without manure is diminished, whatever the description of manure applied.
Taking the average of the four years of complete separation, there were 49 species
found in the samples from the unmanured plot, 33 only by ammonia-salts alone, 39
(over three separation-years only) with the larger quantity of nitrate, and 42 with
the smaller quantity. We have now with the mixed mineral manure alone an
average of 43, which is higher than on any plot with nitrogenous manure, whether
used alone or in conjunction with minerals. The fact is that, with nitrogenous
manure, there is more of forced luxuriance of individual species, varying, it is true,
