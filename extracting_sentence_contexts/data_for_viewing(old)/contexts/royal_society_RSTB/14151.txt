development of pretend play (e.g. [39]) as a proxy for
symbolic cognitive abilities. One key interest of earlier obser-
vational studies was the ability of children to coordinate their
actions and when they begin shifting from parallel play to
social play to pretend play (e.g. [34]). Other scholars have
investigated how young children fight over toys (e.g.
[40-42]), the frequency of conflicts in children (e.g. [43]),
how relationships (friendship and kinship) affect the likeli-
hood of conflict in young children (e.g. [31,44]) and the role
played by individual differences and parental socialization
on how conflicts are resolved (e.g. [44,45]). Among the
many things we know about conflict in young children,
there is the fact that they mostly fight because of access to
toys [46] or violation of personal space [47], the conflicts
are short (between 15 and 24s on average, [42,47]), and the
frequency and duration of conflict between friends and
non-friends is analogous, though they seem less intense
with friends [31]. Interestingly, conflicts between friends
tended to have similar starts compared to non-friends but
different endings, like getting resolved through mutual disen-
gagement in the case of friends. Also, many studies did not
find any effect of gender on the frequency and duration of
conflict (e.g. [31,48]).

While play and fighting both entail sustained interactions
