with unit energy.

As previously, we use the Gaussian approximation of §3b to initiate the Gauss-Newton
method and proceed by path following. Numerical computations are performed by fixing R =1
and varying q (then v =2sinq). Note that v > 0 when q— z, and hence the integration time
in the shooting method diverges in this limit. For each value of q, a solution with unit energy
H=|a1 — an|P + vN l@n41 — 4n|P is obtained by multiplying a numerical solution with energy
Hby R= HWP. The velocity v of this new solution is then given by (3.14).

Figure 12 shows typical travelling breather profiles obtained with the above procedure. They
correspond to a localized excitation superposed in most cases to an oscillatory tail. Tail size
exhibits important variations with respect to v (or equivalently q) during numerical continuation.
This is due to the fact that in the limit of an infinite chain, a continuum of solutions can be expected
in the neighbourhood of a travelling breather for the same value of (v,@). Indeed, as discussed in
§3d(ii), we expect that travelling breathers can be superposed on an oscillatory tail with amplitude
and wavenumber linked by equation (3.30), and the tail amplitude provides an additional free
parameter.
