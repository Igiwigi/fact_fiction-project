be the equations of the two surfaces whose contact is the subject of consideration. The

conditions of contact may, as is well known, be written thus :

Another form of these conditions is, however, better adapted to our present purpose.
In fact, writing

d,V0,.U—d,Va.U=3,U, d,Va,U—d,Va,U=3,U,

we may take as the conditions necessary, in order that V shall touch U at the point P,

Similarly, as I have shown in a memoir © On the Contact of Surfaces ” (Phil. Trans.
