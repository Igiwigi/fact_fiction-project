To this snbstance the names of reduced or
purple cruorine” and reduced hemoglobin® have been given.

4. By passing hydrogen, carbonic acid, or laughing-gas through blood the oxygen
is expelled, 7. 6. the colouring-matter is reduced?. Blood which has been reduced by
hydrogen or carbonic acid may be made to furnish crystals of reduced hemoglobin,
which are isomorphous with those of the oxidized body, but which differ from it in
colour and in optical characters when examined with the spectroscope'”.

5. © We may infer from the facts above mentioned that the colouring-matter of blood,
like indigo, is capable of existing in two states of oxidation, distinguishable by a differ-
ence of colour and a fundamental difference in the action on the spectrum. It may be
made to pass from the more to the less oxidized state by the action of suitable reducing
agents, and recovers its oxygen by absorption from the air” (STokrs)".

6. The loosely combined oxygen of the colouring-matter may be expelled by carbonic
oxide gas; one volume of carbonic oxide takes the place of one yolume of oxygen ”.
'The compound thus formed differs from the O-compound in not yielding a less oxygen-
ized substance when treated with suitable reducing agents'*.
