stronger than the outer shell; but this opinion has in reality no foundation in
ment, excepting only uncertain deductions from occasional explosions and the fail
vessels under high pressures in cireumstances of a very variable and doubtful ch:
There have been no definite rules to guide us hitherto in proportioning the diamete
length, and thickness of plates of the flues, 80 as to correspond with the strength of
boiler; and even in cases where explosions have taken place from,collapse, we haye,
is to be feared, too frequently mistaken the actual cause, in consequence of the
covering the site, and the force which has torn to pieces the outer s8hell. The anoma
lous position in which these constructions are placed has greatly retarded the applica. tion of science to their improvement, and there appears, in fact, to be no rule known |
by which to attain uniformity of strength between those parts of a boiler exposed to an
internal tensile, and those exposed to an external compressive force. S

To supply this want, and to remedy certain anomalous results arising from defective
forms of construction, it appeared desirable that these vessels should be subjected to
direct experiment, and the Laws of Resistance as far as possible ascertained, and the
necessary formula deduced for the future guidance of the practical mechanic and. engineer.
