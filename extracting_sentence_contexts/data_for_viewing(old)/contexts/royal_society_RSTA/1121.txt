SHTC heat conduction equation [8,9].

(v) The symmetry of the thermal stress

Let us now consider the question of symmetry of the energy-momentum. Thus, in new terms, the
thermal stress can be written as

Ju Ej, = —(Wy + Tuyp)(su” + Eo,) = —Wp Ew, + Tsuyu” + swyu? + TE, Up), (2.34)

which is symmetric if and only if =
sw” =T&,. (2.35) 13

This, in fact, implies that Er =Er + 2TEw =s — 2T&» =0, that is E(T, J) =E(J) does not depend [=
explicitly on T and we can identify E = E in (2.28). [2

(vi) Heat flux 3
Recall that, in the SHTC theory [8,9,16], the heat flux is introduced as : 3
q' := &&w, =TEw,, (2.36) cal
hence, if condition (2.35) holds, the thermal stress (2.34) can be equivalently rewritten as
JM Ej, =—(sésulu? + wh Sy, + grub + ug), (2.37)

which is manifestly symmetric. Hence, the total energy-momentum for a relativistic heat-
conducting fluid (anisotropic shear stress is omitted) reads

—T/ =(s& — €)uPup + (—pS — s& + E)h", — sw" up — We Ew, — Guy — U qu, (2.38)
