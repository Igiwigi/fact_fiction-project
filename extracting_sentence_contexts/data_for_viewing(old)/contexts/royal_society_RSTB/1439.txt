with the innermost elements of the nodal xylem. ‘This point is illustrated in
fig. 10.
In no case, except where the preservation is bad, has a canal been ex

From these observations we conclude: that the internodal canals of C
represent the earliest-formed xylem of the primary vascular bundles ;
primitive wood became disorganized and ruptured, owing to the longitudi
transverse extension of the growing internode ; and that the formation of |
was due to a tearing of the tissue caused by the presence of a strand of ines
lignified elements among the actively-growing parenchymatous cells,
