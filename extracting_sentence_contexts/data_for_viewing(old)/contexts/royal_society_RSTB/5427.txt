figs. 20 eand f. In the embryo Nebalia the sixth and seventh ganglia are separate, but
the seventh later fuses with the sixth (CLaus, 1888). The terminal segment or telson
bears the anus and a large caudal furca, and the sixth abdominal appendages are small.
In Hemimysis fusion of the sixth and seventh segments is carried much farther. The
region behind the seventh segment represents the telson, in front of which all new segments
have been formed in the embryo. The telson bears the anus and a caudal furea, but
the latter is lost at the first ecdysis. Finally, the telson grows backwards above the anus
and the uropods enlarge. Thus the segmentation of Nebalia and Hemimysis is directly

“e

comparable, Hemimysis showing a greater concentration of the posterior parts. The
main difference lies in the fact that in Nebalia the caudal furea is large, while in Hemimysis
the uropods are large and the caudal furca embryonic, the telson forming a median out-
growth. However, it is not yet clear whether the caudal furca of Hemimysis embryo is
the same as that of the adult Nebalia.

Ciaus (1872) first suggested that the last two segments and the caudal furca of Nebalia
represented the telson of the Malacostraca, pointing out that a provisional caudal furca
is present in the protozoa of Sergestes and Pencus (1884). His comparison is not quite
accurate, but it is probable that the sixth and seventh abdominal segments of Nebalia
are represented by the “sixth” abdominal segment in the Malacostraca, the telson
remaining directly comparable in both groups.
