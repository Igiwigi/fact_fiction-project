motion and sensation, in correspondence with its rising from the brain by two roots. In
such a case, the trunk of the nerve, consisting of the united roots, is affected ; and
the privation of function is complete. In the present instance, the motion alone of
the limbs was lost, by the destruction of the anterior roots of the nerves ; whilst the
sensibility remained, owing to the posterior roots being unaffected.

I am unwilling to enter on $0 great a snhject as the influence of the cerebellum,
and of that posterior column of the spinal marrow which descends from it. Im-
portant as these parts must be in the ceconomy, there are no facts to countenance
the belief, that they are directly connected with the functions of motion and sen-
Sibility. Indeed the posterior column of the spinal marrow has been found softened
to a degree, which we must suppose inconsistent with the continuance of its func-
tions; and yet sensibility has been entire. But let not this fact militate against our
conelusions. The column in the spinal marrow which gives rise to the sensitive roots,
is posterior to that from which the motor roots arise ; but is not the posterior portion
of the spinal marrow. Some have imagined, from finding the posterior column of
the spinal marrow softened, in cases where sensibility was entire during the life of
the patient, that they had found an argument unfavourable to our general conclu-
Si0ns.

In consideration that the results of the experiments on the roots of the nerves of
the spine, first made thirty years ago, have thus been confirmed by pathology, the
Society will perhaps permit me to state how I was induced to commence these experi-
ments. In thus adverting to my early investigations, I am only desirous of showing
the principle which guided me in these pursuits.
