cord, its connexion with the spinal nerves, its terminations, cephalic and caudal, and
its relations to the suprarenal bodies, and collateral ganglia. In the succeeding
account the order followed will be that of development, as far as the subject under
consideration allows, and as far as possible drawings from the actual specimens will be
utilised to demonstrate the facts adduced.

1. Formation of the Main Sympathetic Cord: Early Stages.

The examination of very young Mammalian embryos leads only to negative conclu
sions regarding the origin of the sympathetic cord.

In Rat embryos about 5-6 days old, cut zm utero, hardened in spirit and stained
with aniline blue-black (Bevan-Lewis), the spinal cord is incompletely closed, the brain
consists of its three primary vesicles, and the optic vesicles are in process of formation.
In transverse sections through the thoracic region (Plate 22, fig. 1), the notochord (No.)
is large and distinct, is surrounded by a sheath, and is in close contact with the
spinal cord (Sp.C.). Below is the alimentary canal (Al.), in the ventral wall of which
