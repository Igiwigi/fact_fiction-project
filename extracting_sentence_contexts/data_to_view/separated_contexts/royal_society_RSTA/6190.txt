To give more detail, figure 6 shows a single unsmoothed run (red lines), from this final batch,
but now for hospital deaths and total deaths for England and all seven regions, and shows the
sort of quality of matches we are seeing so far. The black points give the (unsmoothed) death
data and the combined uncertainties due to o¢ and o, shown as the blue lines. The fact that
JUNE matches several regions simultaneously, at least over the first wave, without resorting to
any region specific parameters, suggests that geographical variations in the relative importance


in different types of interaction drove/affected the different epidemic curves in those regions. Further, more detailed investigation to confirm this is of course required. We leave the extension
to 2021 and beyond to the future work, as this requires the complex behavioural and partial
restrictions (on travel, visiting relatives, etc.) imposed over the December 2020 Christmas period
(the ‘cancelled Christmas’) and the January to April 2021 lockdown and subsequent staggered
release to be implemented and tested, possibly requiring additional time-dependent parameters,
which is the ongoing work (although we note that vaccines and multiple variants have already
been implemented in JUNE).
