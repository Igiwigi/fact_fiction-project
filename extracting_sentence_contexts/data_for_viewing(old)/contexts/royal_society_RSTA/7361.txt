The variations of y, V_,, K, etc., are complicated, but they present no insuperable
difficulty, especially if the angle through which the elevator is turned does not involve
large changes inz_,. If this is the case, it is also fairly safe to make di_,/dy a constant.
Finally we have to consider dy/dt. If the elevator is turned at a constant rate there is

no difficulty. If not, we can use dy g ,dy

dt V_,4 do
and any assumed relation between y and @ will, when the problem is solved, become
some relation between 7 and t.
This method has been used successfully by Mr J. Seddon of Leeds University to
deal with the flattening out from a dive. Results of considerable interest have been
obtained, agreeing with observed facts. It is hoped to publish them soon.

LANCHESTER’S PHUGOIDS CORRECTED FOR DRAG

13. The neglect of the drag in the phugoids produces the bizarre effect that we
can have a horizontal path, or that, in general, the machine continually rises to the
same level, although there is no engine to supply the energy dissipated by the air
resistance. It is for some purposes (e.g. in dealing with the flattening out from a dive)
useful to correct Lanchester’s phugoids for the drag, not a complete second approxima-
tion, but better than the first.
