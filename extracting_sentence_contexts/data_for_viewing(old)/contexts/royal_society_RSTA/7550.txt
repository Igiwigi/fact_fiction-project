For these last forms, put g =j, x = &, u = Ul, in the forms of § 10. Then L, = 0 on account

of the factors’ Pie: and M, = 0 onaccount of the factor 7 Hence, by (10-4), which applies

here, M,+N, = 0. But M, = F, and N, = Hj. Hence H, = —F, = 0, and by interchange of
k, Lor &, we see that the remaining forms of the system are = 0. In particular, if§ = 9 = x,
we see that all the possible forms admit an invariant reduction. The dual forms reduce in
exactly the same way.

13. Itis now a simple matter to show that the remaining forms of the system A, of grade
eight or more, are reducible (and in fact admit an invariant reduction). For any such form
may be obtained by substituting appropriate symbols or combinations of symbols for € and
7 in the form on the left of (12-1), and hence all such forms are = 0. The enumeration of the
irreducible forms belonging to the system A is accordingly complete.

Subdivision of the system of forms B

14. The forms ofthe system B occur in dual pairs, and we shall consider the two forms of
such a pair together. Any form of the system can be expressed as a product PQ, where P is
a product of factors of the form (zju), or the dual ofsuch a product, and Q is made up of chains
and tags. We shall take as the representative of a pair of dual forms that in which P is com-
posed of factors (zju), and subdivide the system according to the nature of this product.
It is easy to see that if the form does not include a reducible factor, the a priori possibilities,
