In this Table the actual measurements have been exhibited in order to afford an idea
of the accuracy with which the proportion holds, without attempting to estimate the
probable error.

22. In endeayouring to frame a similar Table between the horizontal force and decli-
nation, a curious fact presented itself.

Although it is comparatively easy to find changes in the vertical force which are similar
to corresponding changes in the horizontal force, yet it is much more difficult to find
8imilar corresponding changes in the horizontal force and declination, Inde?d, for many
of the cases recorded in the aboye Table, the declination-change would not be similar to
that of either force. It thus appears that, even in cases which do not indicate the action
of a pure elementary disturbance, the horizontal-force change preserves an almost
invariable relation to that of the vertical force®,

23, The following would appear to be the explanation of this.

Whatever be the nature of an elementary disturbing force, its effect upon the hori.
