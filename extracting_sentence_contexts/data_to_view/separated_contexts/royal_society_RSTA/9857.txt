If D is
taken ten times smaller, or 1°44 x 10°, the energy required per cubic centimetre is only
0°27 calories per cubic centimetre, which is about one-third of the heat capacity per
cubic centimetre. This value of D makes the thickness of the double layer
2x 107* centim. instead of 2°6x 10~%, and with it Q’ log (D/A) is nearly as constant
as with the value used. In fact, the possible error in D is at least a factor of 10, so
that the difficulty about the specific heat is not very serious in the case of platinum
if the value of p,, deduced from the negative leak, is taken.

10. Conclusion. The view taken in the above paper is that the effect of the hydrogen on the
negative leak is due to its presence in the surface layer of the platinum.
