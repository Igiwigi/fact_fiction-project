Conversely, if one trait is selected to increase
while the other is selected to decrease, then this selection
will tend to create a positive covariance between them. The
third term shows that if the traits tend to be both positively
or negatively selected at the same times, then this also con-

tributes to a negative covariance. This is a generalization of the fact, associated with the Hill-
Robertson effect [24], that selection for alleles at two different
loci leads to a negative gametic disequilibrium between them
(gametic—or ‘linkage’—disequilibrium can be interpreted as

environment, to highlight the effects of there being different
heritabilities in different environments. Similarly, equation
(5.13) assumed that ¢° = ¢, to highlight the effects of selection
alone on changing covariation between traits.
(5.13) The difference between this approach and conventional
model building is that instead of starting out with simplifying
assumptions, and letting these determine the mathematics
that we will use and the results that we can see, we start
with only assumptions that we think are exactly true (scienti-
fic axioms) and derive our main results from these. These
general results, when expanded, are likely to be complicated
(cf. equation (3.4)), but are made up of terms that have clear
biological meaning.
