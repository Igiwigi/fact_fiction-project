This ditierentia-
tion of the Gymnosperms into two divisions, which I here propose to refer to as the
Phyllosperms (with leaf-borne seeds) and Stachyosperms (with stem-borne seeds),
respectively, appears to be very old, for, as far as I am aware, there is among the
Pteridosperms no sign of a transition from the phyllospermic to the stachyospermic
condition : a sharp differentiation is seen as far back as the available fossil records
can take us. There could scarcely be a greater contrast in this respect than there is
between RenAvutt’s well-known figure of Cordaianthus Williamsoni (see Scorr, 1909,
p. 540) and the equally familiar figure of Lyginopteris Oldhamia, which forms the
frontispiece of Dr. Scort’s ‘ Studies.’ Combined with this fact there are other important features, in which, as Dr. Scorr
points out (1909, p. 650), the Cordaiteze and the fern-like seed-plants are as far apart
as two groups of Gymnosperms very well can be. The strap-shaped parallel-veined
leaves of Cordaites, and in fact the leaves of any known Stachyosperm, living or
fossil, are entirely different from the much-divided fern-like fronds of the Pterido-
sperms or the almost équally complex leaves of the Cycads. The result is that in
habit the two groups are totally distinct, and it is not easy to picture a Pteridosperm
frond reduced into the simple Cordaitean leaf—at any rate, no intermediate form is
yet known.
