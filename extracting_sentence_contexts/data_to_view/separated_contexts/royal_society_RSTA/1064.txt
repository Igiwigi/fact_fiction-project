The X-ray photograph of $-keratin, I, is most conveniently referred to an orthogonal
cell of dimensions, a = 9-3 A., bi= 6:7-6:8 A., and ¢ = 9-8 A. (see footnotet, p. 371),
of which 6 is the most prominent period along the molecular chains, while @ and ¢ are
“ side-spacings.”” With regard to the latter two points emerge, (i) that the equatorial
“ spot ” nearer the centre which gives the c-spacing is preserved more or less unchanged
when the «-photograph is transformed to the 6-photograph, and (ii) that the trans-
formation calls into existence on the equator a very strong spot of spacing @/2, 7.e.,
4-65 A. From a study of existing X-ray data on proteins§ the interpretation of these
results seems clear, that, in fact, the spacing 9-8 A. common to both «- and @-photographs
arises from the lateral extension of the side-chains (the R-groups of the general
formula given above), while the spacing 4-65 A.|| represents the distance of approach
of the main-chains on those sides free from side-chains. The controlling factor
in this closest approach of neighbouring “ backbones” is most probably attraction

* Footnotes * and f, p. 334. { Much the greatest proportion of the amino-acid mixture obtained by the hydrolysis of silk fibroin is
glycine and alanine, but it is not certain that the X-ray photograph is incompatible with arrangements
other than strict alternation of the residues of these two acids.
