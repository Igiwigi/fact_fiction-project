Z The high absorbing power of the hammered platinum, or rather the low absorbing

wer of the fused metal, was ascribed to a mechanical difference between the two—to a
more open texture in the former, permitting more free access of hydrogen, liquefied as
it may be, to the interior of the metal.

8. The extrication of occluded hydrogen from platinum had always required a degree
of temperature verging upon a red heat, even when aided by a vacuum ; and this remains
true of hydrogen originally absorbed at or near a red heat. But the fact appears to be
compatible with the absorption of the gas, under the pressure of the atmosphere, at a
considerably lower temperature. Thin platinum-foil was first deprived of a little natural
gas by ignition in vacuo in the porcelain tube. The foil was afterwards placed in a glass
tube and heated again in a stream of hydrogen, to a temperature not exceeding 230" C.,
for three hours, by means of an oil-bath, and further allowed to cool slowly in an atmo-
