the ascending terminal limb of the fissure of Sylvius. It appears preferable to leave
the interpretation undefined rather than to appear exact by insisting upon precise
identification in each case.

The vertical furrow connecting the sulcus postcentralis superior with sulci of the
supramarginal gyrus lying posterior to the posterior end of the fissure of Sylvius, as
seen in ยง.13.R., occurs in nine other hemispheres, eight of which are on the right side
(C.2.R., S.1.R., Q.2788.R., Q.1905.R., Q.1487.R., S.6.R., Q.2640.L., $.5.R., and
S.8.R.). In the majority of these cases the width of the inferior postcentral gyrus is
reduced.

In S.1.R. the cortex of the temporal lobe has been destroyed, but sufficient remains
to establish the fact that the inferior parallel sulcus is closely connected with the long
vertical sulcus passing up to the sulcus postcentralis superior. Posterior to this,
the pattern of the sulci of the inferior parietal lobule is H-shaped. The sulcus occi-
pitalis anterior forms a complete arcade parallel with the sulcus lunatus. The
three ascending branches of the parallel sulcus into the inferior parietal lobule are
here clearly seen and identified by their relations with the arcades of the sulcus
intraparietalis.

The conception of the three arcades of the intraparietal sulcus and of the three
ascending branches is admittedly somewhat diagrammatic, but it has come into
being by a study of the phylogenetic sequence. With the diagram as a background
all the remaining hemispheres are to a great extent capable of being interpreted.
