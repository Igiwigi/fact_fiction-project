When the diameter of the
tube was reduced to one-seventh of an inch he found that he could not make the mixture explode,
although coal gas was more explosive than fire-damp. He then exploded mixtures of fire-damp
via a jar connected with a bladder filled with the same mixture by means of a stopcock with an
aperture of one-sixth of an inch and found that the flame did not ignite the gas in the bladder. On
comparing the effect of connections between the jar and the bladder made of glass and metal, he
noted that flames passed more readily through glass tubes than metal tubes of the same diameter,
a fact that he attributed to the higher thermal conductivity of the metal and, hence, the cooling it
produced, bearing in mind his earlier observation that—in his own words—the fire-damp requires
a very strong heat for inflammation. Davy also established that the explosion would not pass through metal slots if their diameter
was less than one-seventh of an inch, provided they were of sufficient length, nor would it pass
through fine wire-gauze. The latter was an important discovery.
