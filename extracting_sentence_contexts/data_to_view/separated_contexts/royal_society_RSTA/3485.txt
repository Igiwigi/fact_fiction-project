Formally, use of these priors prevents learning [10], but we .
consider them as envelopes for a dense set of proper priors. The posterior distribution F;: is
itself the envelope of the posterior distributions corresponding to the family of proper priors with
weight s. The derivation is contained in the electronic supplementary material, section S4. (ii)
Consistency follows from the fact that limy— 4. Fe) = limnoo E, n = FY and limy—o0 Un+s = Idjo,1],
thus limy—oo Fp = Fy. a

Remark 5.3. In the limits | 0 the upper and lower distributions coalesce into the single random
distribution

This is the Bayesian Bootstrap method introduced by Rubin [7] as a Bayesian analogue of the
bootstrap method.
