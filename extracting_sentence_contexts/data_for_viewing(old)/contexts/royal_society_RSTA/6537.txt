Thus, we have coupled both the continuous and discrete Fourier transforms. A procedure for
continuing with such a coupling is given in Slepyan [39]. Specifically, the combined expressions
(3.9) can be reduced to a single discrete transform via the following fact. If a function fF (k)
represents the product of the continuous gt (k) and the discrete hF4(k) transforms,

fF =F nF) and Fa (: + =) =h*4(k), (3.10)

then the corresponding discrete transform of f (an) is
