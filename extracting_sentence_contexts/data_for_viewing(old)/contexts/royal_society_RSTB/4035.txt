oxygen was pure, being produced directly from an oxylith generator ; but little or
none of the oxygen would reach the lung alveoli at the first breath, owing to the dead
space in the connections.

From these tracings it is perfectly clear that oxygen abolished the periodic breathing,
which returned again soon after air was breathed. It will be seen that the first
effect of the oxygen was to prolong the succeeding period of apncea, but that at least
one other period of breathing, and subsequent apnoea, followed before the breathing
became regular. It might, perhaps, have been expected that the oxygen would simply
produce a long apnoea, followed by regular breathing. This would doubtless have
been the case if the oxygen inspired at first had been sufficient to raise the alveolar
oxygen pressure higher; but as a matter of fact it would take a number of breaths
thoroughly to wash out the alveoli with oxygen, and the first two or three breaths
would only raise the oxygen pressure sufficiently to prolong the subsequent apncea.
The numerous analyses of alveolar air by Doueias and by Dotveias and Hanpane,
after taking in a breath or two of oxygen, illustrate this point. Similarly, it took a
considerable time after the breathing of air was re-established before the periodic
breathing returned.

We are now in a position to discuss the periodic breathing and other allied
phenomena observed on Pike’s Peak. It will be seen from Tables ITV. and fig. 6
that on ascending Pike’s Peak the alveolar oxygen pressure fell from about 100 mm.
at sea-level to about 50mm. At this alveolar oxygen pressure want of oxygen plays,
under ordinary circumstances, a part in exciting the respiratory centre in most
