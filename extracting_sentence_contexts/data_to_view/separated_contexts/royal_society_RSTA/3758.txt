The inclination angle is typically within 12째 and 16째,
cf. [11] and references therein including [22-24]. This study exhibits similar large-scale structural
organization with an inclination angle that is relatively constant between 11째 < 6, < 15째 for wall-
normal locations yt < 150. Although FST disturbs the boundary layer from outside, the fact that it
does not destroy the large-scale structural organization in the log region is a promising result for
