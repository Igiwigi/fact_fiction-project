The blood-vessels have been investigated partly by dissection and partly by means

a of serial sections, and such completeness of detail as I have been able to attain is
a very largely due to the adoption of a method of fixing and hardening which I have
5 found to have many advantages both for the study of the vascular system and of
S the brain itself. By this method the entire contents of the cranial cavity are fixed
s and hardened 7m situ, and are then in excellent condition either for dissection or
& for histological purposes. The application of the method in the case of Sphenodon
= is greatly facilitated by the fact that the brain does not occupy nearly the whole of

S the cranial cavity, a large subdural space being left, especially above the brain, across
3 which numerous blood-vessels run, together with delicate strands of connective tissue
3 which connect the dura mater with the pia. 5 The animal is killed by chloroform, and the eyeballs are carefully removed from the
8 orbits with as little loss of blood as possible.
