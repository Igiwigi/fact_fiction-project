When the fornix reaches the antero-superior surface of the cornu Ammonis, it
forms the fimbria and sends fibres into the cortex, and also a leash of fibres round the
ventricular surface of the cornu Ammonis to the subiculum; this forms the alveus.
We thus see that the cornu Ammonis is surrounded on three of its sides, viz., the
supero-anterior, external, and infero-posterior, as well as on its anterior limit, by the
different parts of the fornix, ¢.e., the fimbria and alveus, which thus form a con-
tinuous sheet of white matter over those surfaces of the cornu Ammonis.

x Itis therefore not difficult, by examining frontal and horizontal sections, to explain
3 how in sagittal sections made through the outer part of the cornu Ammonis, we see
8 this structure to be oblong in shape, to diminish as we proceed outwards, and to
£ be surrounded by a layer of fibres, the alveus. In sagittal sections the cornu lessens
Sin extent from above downwards, from the fact that, as we descend in horizontal
Zsections, it projects more into the lateral ventricle, and this lower part would there-
Sfore be the last to disappear in sagittal sections made successively from within
Boutwards,
E The direction of the fibres of the fimbria and the alveus is important, and it can
é only be made out by careful examination in all the three planes. To begin posteriorly,
‘5 the fibres of the fimbria in sagittal and fronto-oblique sections (figs. 11, 48) run in the
plane of the latter section, 7.c., downwards and backwards ; they are continued into
-3 the alveus in the same plane as faras the inferior surface of the cornu}Ammonis, where
2 the direction becomes more obliquely antero-posterior. It was found so very difficult
eto combine the appearances of the fimbria and the alveus into one mental picture, that
> it was necessary to make a model of the cornu Ammonis, and arrange the fibres
= # according to their appearances already seen in the various planes. On doing this it
