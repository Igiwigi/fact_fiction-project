manner already described under V. urticew, &c. I could only obtain single specimens
in Oxford, and I thought that the experiments would have to be delayed for another
season. However, justâ€™ when the experiments on V. urtice came to an end, on
September 8, I went to Seaview, in the Isle of Wight, and there found the kitchen
gardens ravaged by the larve of P. brassice, while those of P. rape were very
abundant on mignonette. Accordingly, I made the experiments described below, and,
although they were not as accurately or minutely conducted as those on V. urtice, they
yield some valuable results, and entirely confirm the previously adopted conclusion
that the colour-etlects are due to larval and not to pupal sensitiveness. Being away
from my laboratory, and not expecting such an opportunity, it was, of course, impossible
to carry out the experiments in the most satisfactory manner. The results obtained
with the two species are described together, because they were, in nearly all cases,
kept under similar conditions and were, in fact, often placed in the same cylinders.
Furthermore, the results were remarkably uniform. When no locality is mentioned
in any experiment it is understood that the included larvee were captured at Seaview.


LEPIDOPTEROUS PUPA) AND THEIR SURROUNDING SURFACES. 409

Both species are peculiarly adapted for experiments of this kind because of their quiet
disposition and the great length of the period preparatory to pupation,

Before describing and classifying the results of the experiments upon the larvee of
P. brassice, it is necessary to construct a standard of the various degrees of colour
assumed by the pupa. In making such a list, it is necessary to take account of two
