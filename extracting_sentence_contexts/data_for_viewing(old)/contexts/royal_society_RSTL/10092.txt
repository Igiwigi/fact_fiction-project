cortical lamination. Above the fissure lies the five-laminated cortex of the extra-limbie
mass, with its intercalated xeries of granule cells ; beneath it lies the three-laminated
cortex of the outer olfactory region and gyrus hippocampi, whilsb still further back
there is found internal to it the remarkable modified olfactory cortex which has been
described near the occipital pole. Within the great limbic lobe we find a sulecus,
dividing two important and morphologically distinct regions. These regions are the
outer and inner olfactory areas whose boundary line is the olfactory suleus, wherein
lies imbedded the superticial olfactory fasciculus. It was moreover shown that the
superior parietal sulcus forms a sharp line of demarcation betwixt the five-laminated
type of the parietal mass and the peculiar dense granule formation of the posterior or
modified upper limbic cortex. In the higher animals, as was indicated in the former
paper, the fissure of RoLAaNDo, here lying at the frontal pole, separates a five from a
8ix-laminated cortex. We surely have here a most important fact, and otie which, if
followed up in further researches, will enable us to map out the convolutionary surface
of the brain after a less arbitrary plan than the one usually adopted. The more fully
T investigate the minute structure of the cortex and its deep connexions, the more
forcibly am T impressed by the belief that the various fissures and sulci are not mere
accidental productions, but have a deep significance of their own, dividing off the
cortical superficies into morphologically if not physiologically distinet organs. Hitherto
the fissures and 8ulci which I have found to be the boundary lines of distinet cortical
realms are the following :â€”

1. The limbie fissure,

2, The infra-parietal 8uleus.
