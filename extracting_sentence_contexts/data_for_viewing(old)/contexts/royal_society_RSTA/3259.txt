Figure 4. Birge—Sponer plots for (a) the 2/7 and (b) the 27+ states, constructed from the calculated vibrational energy
spacings obtained from the RCCSD(T)/aV oo Z potentials. The solid lines are obtained from the a» and qeXe values reported
in table 1 and come from the lowest two vibrational energy levels and D.. For the 7/7 state, the filled circles indicate levels at
high v that form a linear section of the plot close to the long-range region. (Online version in colour.)

carbon and RG centres are distorted away from each other. We hypothesize that the softening of
the potential as Re is approached occurs from increased short-range repulsion, which softens the
form of the overall (repulsion-+attraction) potential in the */7 state. The fact that the Birge-Sponer
plots change their character as a function of v could be taken as further evidence for ‘chemical’
contributions (via distortion of electron density) to the interaction potential for the 7/7 state.

The Birge-Sponer plots for the 217 state are in contrast to those of the 2+ state, which are also
shown in figure 4. Although there are generally fewer levels, there are still enough to demonstrate
that the behaviour here is ‘normal’ with a linear region at low v and a long-range tail to high v,


with only a slight deviation for C*-Xe. This is in line with there being no off-axis electron density
on the carbon centre to cause the additional repulsion close to Re, as discussed above for the 211
state.
