In the flattened organisms the tail
is sometimes long or whip-like, or the body is shortened and the animal assumes a limpet
shape. From the diversity of the forms of animals met with in the torrents it has been
assumed that there is no adaptation as regards body-form in this fauna. For example,
HuBavtr says, regarding the dorso-ventral flattening, “ Mais enfin l’aplatissement
dorso-ventral est-il réellement une adaptation, une accommodation de l’organisme &
la vie torrenticole ?—C’est douteux 4 mon avis; ce fut surtout pour l’animal une
circonstance heureuse qui lui facilita l’entrée et la, vie dans les eaux rapides.” This

Text-ria. 18.—Body-forms (diagrammatic) of torrent-inhabiting animals. a, b, c= forms of animals
that dangle freely in the current; d, e, f, g, h, 1,7 = forms of animals that lie closely pressed to the
substratum, d, e, f = showing progressive modification towards tapering of the form (compare
strut types B.F. 34 and B.F. 35). g, h, i = showing progressive modification towards limpet-like
form (compare strut type Baby). a= Rhyacophilid Trichopterous larva; 6 =form of free-
swimming fish such as Barbus tor; ¢ = Betisnymph; d =a Balitora fish; e =a Phractura fish ;
f =a Farlowella fish ; g =a Gastromyzon fish ; h = nymph of Iron; i=a Psephenid larva, and
j =a Planarian.

explanation is, in fact, no explanation. Animals with different forms live under different
conditions, and in every case there is a fine adjustment between external form and the
environmental factors. For example, the animals that dangle freely in the current,
such as the larvee of Simuliwm, the nymphs of Betis or the Aischnine living on bare rocks
and among plants like Nephelopteryx, have a cylindrical tapering form.
