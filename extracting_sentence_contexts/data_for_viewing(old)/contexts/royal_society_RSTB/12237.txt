questions regarding the frequency of cross-cultural transitions
away from and towards matriliny, and to better understand
the causes and correlates of such transitions.

We find that transitions away from matriliny have been
comparatively more common, but far from universal,
while reverse transitions are, as anticipated, rarer. Our evi-
dence suggests that both findings may be, at least in part,
an artefact of the time period of colonialism and globaliza-
tion during which the modern ethnographic record came
to beâ€”an artefact that was subsequently codified by nine-
teenth century ethnologists as evidence of unilineal evolution,
but may in fact have been peculiar to the particular period
of time during which colonial officials, missionaries and
anthropologists began recording formal ethnographic and
cross-cultural observations.

Thus, a key implication of our findings is that frequencies
of different forms of descent taken from the SCCS and Ethno-
graphic Atlas may not be indicative of most of human
history, but rather the product of the last few hundred
years. Throughout most of human history (or at least since
the earliest Neolithic), the frequency of matriliny may have
been (and likely was) higher than has been observed in
recent history. This is an important caveat; too often the fre-
