optical elements, by exploiting symmetry conditions in the cavity, and by composite optical
techniques. Early work by Chen et al. outlined some of the considerations to achieve OAM mode
control in lasers [24]. However, many of these approaches were unable to produce controlled
helicity and instead the cavity produced one of the odd/even modes as the fundamental. Such
superpositions of OAM modes have been observed in cavities with spot-defect mirrors [25,26]
(figure 2), alignment-insensitive Porro prism resonators [27] (figure 3), and in a cavity where
a single highly aberrated lens was used to control the mode [28]. In some cases, somewhat
randomly, such amplitude approaches have been able to select a vortex mode but without
control over the handedness. This was recently shown in a helium-neon laser with a spot-defect
mirror [29]. A novel amplitude-based approach that does allow control over the handedness was
introduced by Lin et al. [30]. In this approach, two nanoscale-thickness aluminium strips were
inserted into a conventional diode-pumped solid-state laser, strategically placed to introduce
higher loss for one helicity when compared with the other by virtue of the fact that the standing
wave pattern is a lobe structure that rotates in opposite directions for the two helicities (figure 4).
By this method, it was shown that helicities of = +1 could be selected.

An alternative approach to selecting the desired mode is by shaping the pump light to be
annular [31]. This forces the laser to oscillate in an annular profile by gain shaping [22] rather
than loss shaping—the complement of the spot-defect approach. A similar mechanism has been
employed in a double resonator configuration where the gain is controlled to select the desired
mode [32].

In 2007, Okida et al. [33] made use of an asymmetric ‘bounce oscillator’ to force lasing
on multiple Hermite-Gaussian modes in a Nd:YVO4 gain medium with cylindrical lenses so
that the superposition formed a helical OAM mode. In this cavity no special optical elements
