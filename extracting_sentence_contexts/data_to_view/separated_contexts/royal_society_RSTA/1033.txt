The distance between
the anterior and posterior surface of the model is taken to be 0.3mm, inferior to the average
thickness of the cornea (0.5mm). We remark that the model is statically stable also for zero
thickness, and the distance between the anterior and posterior surface is considered only to
obtain a more realistic shape in the keratoconus case. In fact, it is commonly observed that
keratoconus corneas are much thinner in the zone of the conus, and the possibility to fold
into an acute cone shape is also dependent on the reduced thickness. Clearly, an increase of
the thickness increases the global stiffness of the model; therefore, to maintain the number
of parameters at the minimum, we decided to use the same thickness also for the normal
corneas. Preliminary calculations showed that, for a fixed thickness, the solution of the simplified model
in terms of displacements corresponds to the solution of the corresponding three-dimensional
finite-element model, with an error less than 1%.
