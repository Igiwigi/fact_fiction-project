the husband's family after marriage, 21% living near wife’s
family, 16% living near both spouses’ families and 14%
living near neither spouse’s family [32]. The result of these
residence patterns and household mobility is that most Sho-
dagor live near some members of their extended family for
most of the year. Households are also organized around the
nuclear family. The majority of childcare is done by children’s
parents, and men’s and women’s resources are pooled at the
household level. There are no systematic, community-wide
norms of sharing daily acquired resources beyond the nuclear
family household, though some individuals or families may
occasionally share with relatives on special occasions or
when they are in need. Despite the fact that the nuclear
family household is central to Shodagor social organization,
adults from different households report cooperating with
one another to help with boat repair, to build houses, in child-
care, and to host religious ceremonies throughout the year
(though we might expect this cooperation to take place on a
much smaller scale than in some other human societies).

to the adaptive problem we've laid out here. In many socio-
ecological contexts, alloparental care (any care provided by
someone other than the biological parents of a child) reduces
mothers’ time devoted to childcare and allows them to
engage in other tasks—like subsistence tasks—unencumbered.
