Sis proved by the fact of the characteristic needle-shaped platinum-salt being immediately
Sreproduced when it is saturated with hydrochloric acid and mixed with dichloride of
EZ platinum. The free base is, however, readily decomposed. On boiling, the odour of
& 8ulphocyanate of phenyl becomes at once perceptible; if ebullition be continued until
65) the odour has disappeared, addition of hydrochloric acid and dichloride of platinum
5 no longer furnishes the difficultly soluble needles. In their place, large well-developed
5 orange-yellow octohedra are deposited on evaporation, which by analysis were found to
5 be the platinum-salt of methy]-triethylphosphonium.
