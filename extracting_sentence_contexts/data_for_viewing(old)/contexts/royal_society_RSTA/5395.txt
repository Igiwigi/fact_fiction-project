constrain functional uncertainty to a well-defined and finite collection of quantities. It is necessary
to include both an uncertain 0 and the diffusion Q' odW to represent uncertainty fully, because
@ cannot in general be tuned to make the solution based on f(-) alone an exact match to X. Often
this is because equations are missing from the drift model; approaches for replacing truncated
equations with stochastic terms are discussed in, for example, Penland [5]. Not knowing 6p is
termed parametric uncertainty, while the diffusion represents structural uncertainty—this is the
uncertainty about X that cannot be tuned away by adjusting the parameters. A third source of
uncertainty is input uncertainty, discussed in §5.

In this model for X there will be components of X(t) that are operationally defined,
corresponding to the quantities that we wish to learn, but there may also be additional
instrumental components whose main purpose is to allow us to express our judgements about
the evolution of the operationally defined components more easily. So, in fact it would be more
accurate to say, in the opening paragraph, that we wish to learn a subset of X(t) for te T.

To assist us in learning about X there is a collection of measurements
