Band 8: begins to be shaded at 540, is dark at 535, extends dark to 514, is shaded
off to 506; centre at 523. Band 6 extends from 494 to 473. 4 [The bands y and 6 in the spectra are shown too dark in the figures—8 is, in fact,
barely perceptible. | The general results of these spectrum observations may be summarised thus :—
Turacin, as it exists in the feathers, possesses two absorption bands, one of which,
a, is rather darker and less wide than the other, and is situated about the line D,
extending some distance on its more refrangible side ; the other band, 8, lies between
the first-named and the line 6.
