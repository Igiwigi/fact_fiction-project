Elucidatory Note.—This definition of homaloty should be compared with the
definition of the flatness of a class of punctual lines which has been used in the
elucidatory notes of *3, Thus a class of punctual lines is flat, either when it is a
unit class whose single member is a straight line, o7 when it is a necessary and

sufficient condition of a straight line « being a member of it, that x should meet two
members of the class in points which are not their point of meeting (if they have a
point of meeting). Owing to the fact that “ intersection” (as used here) is wider in
intension and narrower in extension than the idea of the “ meeting” of two punctual
lines, two punctual lines may “meet” without the corresponding objective reals
“intersecting.” The result is that homaloty and flatness have some different
properties, for example, cf. *21°21.
