a whole, Somerset and Glamorgan are seen to resemble each other fairly closely, whereas
Dorset stands apart, principally because of the low limestone-shale ratio in the rotiforme
and bucklandi sub-zones.

Ifindividual horizons in Dorset and Glamorgan are compared, some striking similarities
emerge. First there are the local comparisons. Tolcis and the Dorset coastal section
are separated by a distance of 7 miles. In both these localities the beds maintain their

distinctive lithological characters and thicknesses, often to within an inch. The evidence for
this remarkable fact is recorded elsewhere (Hallam 19576). Within Glamorgan a similar
constancy holds. Bed-by-bed correlation in the planorbis zone between Lavernock and
Bull Cliff, which are 5} miles apart, is an easy matter given one or two key horizons.
Similarly, the thickness of the conybeari sub-zone between Stout Bay and Sea Mouth
(7 miles apart) differs by only 14% of the thickness at the former locality, while, as noted
earlier, individual horizons can be followed in the cliffs. Secondly, Dorset and Glamorgan
may be compared directly. As already noted, two groups of laminated limestones,
