in diameter. It will be noticed that they differ from
adult stems in the small size of the medullary rays and in the absence of carinal canals. It has been suggested that some stems of this type were really the peduncles of cones,
Apart from the fact that they are much more slender than the axes of the Calamo-
stachys cones present in the same slide, there is little evidence for or against this
hypothesis. A still larger twig is seen in R 945 (Plate 8, fig. 4). This is nearly
2 mm. in diameter, and is surrounded by several small leafy shoots, as though they
had been produced as a whorl of branches from it.
