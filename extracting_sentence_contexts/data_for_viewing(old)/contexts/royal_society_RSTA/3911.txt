(co) Diverse describability 5

Owing to its internal complexity, privacy can be described in multiple ways. Kyllo v. US just : =
discussed offers one example. Another more recent case, US v. Jones, presents a whole parade of a
privacy formations. The three opinions—majority and two concurring opinions—offer different OG
formulations of privacy. Each of the opinions find the Government actions to violate the Fourth :2
Amendment, but each emphasizes different aspects of the Governments’ actions as problematic— a
one focusing on the intrusion on private effects and one on the risk posed by warrantless GPS [3
surveillance to the Fourth Amendment goal of ‘curb[ing] arbitrary exercises of police power’ and
‘preventing “a too permeating police surveillance”’ [34, p. 4], and the third on ‘what is really
important (the use of a GPS for the purpose of long-term tracking)’ [34, p. 7]. While reaching
the same result, the analysis in each opinion focuses on different aspects of the Government’s
behaviour, different risks and different justifications. In fact, the second concurrence, written by
Justice Alito, agrees with little in the majority opinion save the holding. Each of the opinions has
merit, and ‘there is nothing absurd or [completely] contradictory’ in the distinct efforts to protect
privacy [14, p. 172].

(d) Openness

Fourth, Gallie argues that an essentially contested concept is persistently vague or open, it
‘admits of considerable modification in the light of changing circumstances’ [14, p. 172]. It is
popular to describe privacy as ‘contextual’ in a narrower sense, to argue that, for example,
sharing of information with your doctor in your doctor’s office is different from sharing that same
information at a cocktail party, because of the contextual situation. But the concept of privacy (not
just its application) is itself ‘open’. The history of privacy exhibits this openness. And, relevant in
