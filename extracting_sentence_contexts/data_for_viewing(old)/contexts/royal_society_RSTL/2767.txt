of the axis of the lens. When such an ambiguity, however, presents itself, we mast
obserye carefully if the diffusion is more elongated in one direction than another, If
it is not, and especially if there is seen a small circular dimple or depression at the
poles when we follow the light reflected from the surface of the lens, there can be no
doubt that the fibres converge to two opposite poles, like the meridians of a globe.
But if the diffused polarity be of an oval form, and if the greater axis of the oval on
one side of the lens be perpendicular to the same axis on the other side, we may then
safely infer that the fibres are related, as in the lens of the salmon, to two septa at
each extremity of the axis of vision. When these methods fail, the ambiguity may
sometimes be remoyed by boiling the lenses, and observing the manner in which
they crack at the poles.

From a too hasty generalization of a small number of facts, LezUweExnork main-
tained that all fishes and birds have two short septa ; and M. SaTT16* has advanced the
same opinion in reference to fishes, and committed the additional mistake of making
every part of the fibres lie in the same plane. Dr. Txomas Youxs maintains that
there are no septa in the lenses either of birds or fishes +; and in pursning the chi-
mera of a muscular lens, he not only renounced discoveries of his own, after Lezu-
WENHOEK, but adopted grave errors which have no foundation whatever either in ob-
servation or analogy.

It is a very remarkable circumstance, that the hare and the rabbit should be the
only quadrupeds whose lenses have two septa, like that of the salmon. This fact was
obseryed by LEeEUwennoek# and also by SarriG, who remarks that the septa are
larger in the lenses of these animals than in those of fishes.
