But a gas heated under conditions where it
syloes no work is raised to the same temperature as it would be had its volume
Semained constant. M. Berruetor admits that it would appear at first sight as if
She gases were heated at constant volume; he adds that the concordance of the
@alculated with the observed numbers supports his explanation of the phenomena.
& Again, the fact that each layer is fired by compression involves the preliminary.
heating of that layer, and this heating must be added to the heat developed by its
Surning. The temperature of the burning layer must, therefore, be greater than
#hat obtained by dividing the heat developed in the chemical change by the specific
fReat of the products of combustion.
2 When a sound-wave alone is transmitted through a gas its velocity shows that
"wach layer of gas forming the wave-front is heated by compression, and there is no
geason why this should not happen when the compression is accompanied by a
xhemical change. To what extent is each layer heated before combustion?
