= 1. The equations which govern the motion of compressible fluid (e.g. the flow of steam
& through a nozzle) present great difficulties even when the fluid is assumed to be inviscid and
.2 as such to ‘slip’ freely over a solid boundary. Osborne Reynolds’s well-known treatment
@ (1886) in effect assumed the velocity to be uniformly distributed over each cross-section,
@ therefore dealt with a problem rendered one-dimensional by assumption. In two dimensions
= very few exact solutions have been discovered, and these relate to cases (e.g. line-vortices,
£and radial or spiral flow to or from a sink or source) which are not realizable in practice.
¢ The basic difficulty, of course, is the inapplicability of the principle of superposition.

& Rayleigh (1916) attacked the two-dimensional problem by a method of successive approxi-
3 mation, but even in the case of flow past a circular cylinder he was not able to proceed very
6 far. Bryan (1918) suggested a semi-graphical method which has not in fact led to results.
& Taylor & Sharman (1928) utilized an electrical analogue to obtain solutions by experiment:
© their method is one of ‘cut-and-try’, and was not successful when the local speed of sound

Was exceeded at any point.

This being the state of theory, a numerical method which is general will have value even
though it be incapable of giving very exact results. Here we present a relaxational treatment
of nozzles which as we believe has amply sufficient accuracy for practical purposes. Like
the electrical tank it fails when the local speed of sound is attained in some part of the field,
and in our concluding section we propose an alternative method to meet this difficulty.

Although most of the material now presented has been in existence for some two years, we
