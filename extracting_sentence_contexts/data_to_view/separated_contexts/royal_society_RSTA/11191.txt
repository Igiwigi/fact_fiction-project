PETAVEL ON THE HEAT DISSIPATED BY

The emissivity in steam at atmospheric pressure is given in fig. 5. The slope of
the curve is much sharper than for any of the gases previously studied. This fact, as
we shall see from the results given below, cannot be entirely accounted for by the
higher temperature of the enclosure. I hope shortly to undertake a research on the emissivity of platinum in gases at a
much higher pressure. For the present the results are too incomplete to allow any
general theory to be formulated. â€˜

The values obtained for the emissivity are to some extent dependent on experi-
mental conditions, such as the diameter of the radiating wire, its position in space
(whether horizontal cr vertical), the dimensions of the enclosure, its absolute tempera-
ture, and the material of which it is made.
