All these appearances will be better under-
stood by their representation in the annexed drawing (Plate
V.) than from any description that can be given. The history of this case, with the account of the dissection,
becomes valuable, as it shows that an imperfect state of the
ovaria is not only attended with an absence of all the cha-
racters belonging to the female after pub rty, but that the
uterus itself, although perfectly formed, is checked in its
growth for want of due structure of those'j arts. That there is an intimate connection between the ovaria and
uterus has long been ascertained ; but that the growth of the
uterus 'should 's0 entirely depend upon that of the ovaria, I
believe to be a new fact; at least it has not been. published in
any work that has come under my. observation. Gge
