In the following, we shall argue that the pyramid representation
is deceptive, for it conveys the idea that the layers stand in a simple linear relationship to one
another, which is by no means the case. More importantly, it suggests that by expanding the
basis (data) all upper-lying layers will expand accordingly, whence the mantra: more data, more
wisdom. This flies in the face of a very general fact of life: sooner or later, all finite systems hit their
ceiling, the technical name of the game being nonlinear saturation, another well-known concept
in the science of complex systems. This is the very general competition-driven phenomenon by
which increasing data supply leads to saturation and sometimes even loss of information; adding
further data actually destroys information. But let us discuss saturation first.
