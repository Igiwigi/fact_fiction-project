Such a behaviour leads to substantially different
desupercooling dynamics after eliminating the parameter w. This is demonstrated in figure 6,
where it is shown that the removal of supercooling for ellipsoidal particles occurs several times
faster than for spherical particles. This is due to the fact that ellipsoids of the same volume with
spheroids have a larger surface area, which means more latent heat of crystallization released
from ellipsoidal surfaces. In addition, this figure also illustrates that the function w(t) may not
have an inflection point in the case of ellipsoidal crystals when the supercooling of a liquid is
quickly removed due to the intense release of latent heat of crystallization.
