The existence of this snuboxide had been long suspected, especially
from the fact, that by heating to dull redness in contact with air, metallic palladium
becomes coloured blue or green on the surface, which colours are removed by violent
ignition. Bxgrzeivs found, however, that this colouring was not attended with any
increase of weight, which arises, however, from the minute quantity of oxide formed,
the colours being those of thin plates ; but there can be now no doubt but that for-
mation of snboxide does 80 occur. That the black powder which is left by the dull
ignition of the basic carbonate is really a definite compound, is strongly supported
by the fact of the accuracy with which the decomposition stops at its formation, and
by the analogy of the subchloride, to be hereafter described, it gains additional force. Yet I have not been able to combine in any way this suboxide with acids. By con-
tact with them, it gives an ordinary salt of the protoxide and metal.
