© I have sug-
gested /in the  Philosophical Transactions of 1801, 2d Part,
page 333, the expansion»and- contraction of those cellular
processes, which: proceed -from ' the bark to the medulla,
which I have: there called the- true, or -silver grain of the
wood; and which have, generally, though most improperly,
been called medullary processes: I have there shown, that
this substance expands and contracts very considerably under
changes of temperature and moisture; and Thave'stated that
a board of oak, which has been formed by cutting across the
supposed medullary processes, can scarcely be made; by any
means, to retain the 'same form and -position when subjected
to'various degrees of heat and moisture. © TI had not at that
time ascertained, with accuracy, the comparative ' expansion


270 Mr. KniGnT upon the extent of the

and contraction of timber, when divided in different directions
relative to the medulla of the tree, and I was not in posses-
sion of any fact which enabled me to prove the existence of
any such power, in a state of action, in the living tree. But
experiments, which I have made at different subsequent
periods, have afforded very satisfactory evidence of the pre-
sence of this power in a state of action in living trees, and
have also enabled me to ascertain some facts, which appear
interesting, and likely to prove useful in directing the proper
mode of application of wood for various purposes, in which
it is important that it should permanently retain its primary
extent and form. These experiments were made upon tim-
ber of many different kinds; but as the results were all very
nearly the same, I shall confine myself to those made upon
the oak, the ash, the beech, and poplar.
