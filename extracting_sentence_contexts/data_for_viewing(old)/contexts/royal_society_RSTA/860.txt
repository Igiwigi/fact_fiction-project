Hence using the operator series expansion for (id + Q’(t))~! we observe we have established that
IP(@Gd + Q'(H)" IDomoynDom(s) < POIlDom(oyrDomB) (1 — IQ’ Hll3a¢@-a))

Hence there exists a T’ > 0 such that for each t € [0, T’] we know G(t) = P(t)(id + Q’(#))~! exists, is
unique, and in fact G € C™([0, T’]; Dom(D) N Dom(B)). a

Remark 2.5 (Initial data). We have already remarked that we set Q’(0) =O so that Q(0) =id.
Consistent with the Riccati relation we hereafter set P(0) = G(0).

Our first main result in this section is as follows.

Theorem 2.6 (Quadratic degree evolution equation). Given initial data Gy € Dom(D) M Dom(B)
we set Q'(0)=O and P(0)=Go. Suppose there exists a T>O such that the linear operators Pé
c™([0,T]; Dom(D)N Dom(B)) and Q’ € C™([0,T];32(Q;Q)) satisfy the linear base and auxiliary
equations. We choose T > 0 so that for t € [0, T] we have deto(id + Q'(t)) 4 0.and ||Q'(E)Il3,(Q;9) < 1. Then
there exists a unique solution G € C*([0,T]; Dom(D) MN Dom(B)) to the Riccati relation which necessarily
satisfies G(0) = Go and the Riccati evolution equation
