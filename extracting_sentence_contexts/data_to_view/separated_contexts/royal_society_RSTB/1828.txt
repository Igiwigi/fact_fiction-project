These are :—

(1). The fact that in nerve the relation between magnitude of stimulus and magni-
tude of electrical effect is arithmetical within at least a considerable range, exceeding
what, judged by the muscular response, may be termed the “ physiological ” range.*

(2). The fact just alluded to that the electrical effect increases with increasing
magnitude of stimulus much beyond the physiological maximum effect as gauged by
muscle. Both these points have been reported upon elsewhere? and are alluded to here
only inasmuch as they were at the outset of these experiments taken to be indicative
of the relative simplicity of nerve-protoplasm, and having regard to the considerable
range within which the electrical effects had been found capable of plus and minus
variations (¢.g., between 2 and 20 or more stimulation units, as compared with a
physiological range between 2 and 5 units), a stimulation strength of 10 units was
uniformly made use of throughout these experiments. Whether the adoption of this medium stimulation strength was essential or no,
has not been fully determined; such preliminary experiments as were made,
indicated weak stimuli as best adapted to the demonstration of increased electro-
mobility, and strong stimuli to that of diminished electro-mobility.
