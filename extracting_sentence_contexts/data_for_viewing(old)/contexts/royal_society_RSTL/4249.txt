tion of oxygen by the leaf whose under surface is exposed to the sun goes on con-
stantly diminishing.

I devised another rather striking mode of making the same experiment. In one
of my trials, I had been surprised to observe that the leaves of Camellia japonice
did not, when exposed to the sun in spring-water, disengage oxygen gas by their
stomata, but that bubbles of this gas went off through the footstalks. I ascertained
afterwards that this fact had already been mentioned by DuTRocaxer. It afforded me
the means of showing the difference of the action of light on the two surfaces of the
same leaf.

To make this experiment, I place in two large tubes filled with spring-water, two
Camellia leaves having an equal surface, and their footstalk directed upwards.
One of the leaves has its upper, the other its lower surface exposed to light, and the
opposite side is shaded. I leave the apparatus for at least five or s8is hours in
the dark, after which I expose it to the diffused light at the temperature of 20* C.
(68* F.); the direct rays of the sun not being necessary to the production of the phe-
nomenon. After twenty minutes of exposure, there appear on the leaf, the upper sur-
face of which is exposed to the light, numerous bubbles of a gas containing 85 to 90
per cent. of oxygen, disengaging themselves from the atrial vessels placed in the
