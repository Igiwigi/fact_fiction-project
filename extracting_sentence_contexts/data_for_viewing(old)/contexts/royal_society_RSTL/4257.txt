Therefore, there is a rapid increase of vapour and decrease of the degree of
humidity during the day, and a rapid diminution of vapour and increase of the
degree of humidity during the evening and night hours. These remarks are to be
understood to apply to a point at the height of four feet only from the earth.

At present I cannot give any information relative to the distribution of vapour at
distances greater than four feet. However, from the fact, that whilst evaporation is
the most rapid, the air at the height of four feet becomes relatively drier than it
would be in consequenece of the increase of temperature alone, it is plain that much
vapour must pass upwards.

In the higher strata of the atmosphere the changes of temperature are less than in
the lower strata ; and at a point not very distant from the earth, but varying in dif-
ferent seasons, the temperature must be stationary during the twenty-four hours of
the day ; we may readily infer that at a certain point above the earth, the air be-
comes relatively more moist during the course of the day whilst the ascending
current continues, and less $0 at night whilst the vapour flows downwards with the
descending current ; being exactly the reverse of the facts which take place at the
height of four feet. At some certain point above the earth, the temperature of the
