carried out before the necessity of determining the internal temperature was
realised. In these, and all succeeding experiments, it was necessary to supply a
greatly increased amount of CO,, in order that the results might in no way depend
on the percentage of CO,. In consequence, in order not to risk incomplete absorption
in the Pettenkofer tubes, each was used for only 1 hour. Since the amounts of
CO, to be determined were so large, there was no objection to using this shorter time
interval. The true temperature of the leaf was not determined in these preliminary
experiments, but must have been several degrees higher than that of the bath, This

is clearly shown by the fact that the value obtained for the assimilation when the
bath was at 11° C., is considerably higher than the amount shown in Section IV.
(ii) to be maximal for that temperature.

The highest value for the assimilation we have found occurs in Experiment L.
I believe that this is also the highest value recorded by any observer.

Table IX. gives the results of some preliminary experiments illustrating the rise in
the temperature of the leaf produced by the direct radiation of an intense light. The
temperature of the bath was 32° C., a temperature at which a leaf can live for over
a week without being outwardly affected. Under the influence of the intense light,
however, large brown patches appeared, the leaf became flaccid, and lost very rapidly
a third of its weight, its behaviour thus resembling that of a leaf which has been
