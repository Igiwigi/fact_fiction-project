Fusion should be primed to reap the same benefits. A public that is increasingly advocating
for clean energy and ‘Green New Deals’ are primed to support a new energy source that is clean,
safe, affordable and secure. They are primed for a renewal of the energy system. For that reason,
the FIA is educating key stakeholders in the private, public and philanthropic sectors about the
importance of tomorrow’s fusion power economy.

Finally, everyone agrees about the need for fusion research, development, and deployment to
be subject to appropriate health, safety and security standards. A regulatory system that enables
technology development and deployment, without stifling development, is a critical enabler of
development. A particular challenge is that in many countries, fusion is regulated by the same
entity that fission is regulated. While both are assuredly nuclear technologies, there are many
important differences. In fact, you could make a convincing argument that fusion is in fact the
opposite of fission, and should be regulated as such. Fission regulations reflect an understanding
that nuclear chain reactions can get out of control, exposing the public to dangerous radiation.
With a fusion power plant designed with safety in mind, no such danger exists. The role of
the regulator is to prescribe areas of risk, and ensure that the risk is properly mitigated. The
FIA has been proposing the development of appropriate, risk-informed regulation about where
experiments are built and sited, and there is reason for optimism about the trajectory for licensing
of commercial fusion power.

Finally, I will provide a brief discussion about building an Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE) commercial
