Darwin dealt at considerable length
with the genus in his Ray Society monograph in 1851, and since then only one new species
has been describedâ€”L. pacifica Borradaile, 1900. In 1926, however, Seymour Sewell showed
that, apart from one doubtful species, L. rhodiopus (Gray), all the others could be divided
into two groups. One group of five, he suggested, constituted, in fact, a single species,
L. dorsalis (Ellis). The other group of two I dealt with systematically in my report on the
Great Barrier Reef Expedition collection (Cannon 1935) and came to the conclusion that
they also represented a single species, L. valentiana (Gray). The material on which this paper is based consists mainly of a few specimens of L.
valentiana, collected and fixed in Bouin, which were very kindly given to me by Professor
