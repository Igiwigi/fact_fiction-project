ground. They live in dry silken tubes about 20 mm. long and 0-5 mm. in diameter.

The late Dr. D. SHARP gave an interesting account of the mode of life of this larva
in a letter to Dr. D. Keri, from which the following extracts are taken :—‘*‘ The
tubes are very delicate and flatten and collapse except in the part the larva may
happen to be in. They are not perfect or elaborate structures and are more or less
broken at the extremities. It is difficult to find any mode of construction other than
the emission by the larva of sheets of silken slime adhering to the wood by dampness
and close apposition and moreover by side threads of silk. The tubes I feel sure
are not properly a construction at all. Many Mycetophilid larvae are covered with
slimy silk they are constantly emitting. The matter emitted by Diadocidia appears
to be of a more silky and less slimy nature than usual, and I imagine that to this
fact and to the adhesion to the wood and possibly to some peculiarity in the integu-
ment of the larva the tubular form taken by its emitted matter is due.”

“ The larva frequently rests in the anterior part of the tube and protrudes its small
head, moving it from side to side and touching the wood but making no movement
that looks like the prehension of food. When alarmed it will dart rapidly along the
tube as already stated, but usually its movement is a deliberate glide made apparently
without any effort. The posterior part of the body is sometimes apparently exerted
from the tube and when again withdrawn it leaves a prolongation of the smear
behind it. It is in fact always covered with the slime or silk and it looks as if this
were extruded from the posterior part of the body. I believe, however, this is not
the case, but that it comes from the mouth and that the posterior part of the body is
constantly as it were drowned in this sludge. This point is of importance in con-
