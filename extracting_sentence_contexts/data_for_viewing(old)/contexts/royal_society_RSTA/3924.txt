But now we may collect data from individuals which is in neither class. This occurs when the
observations are unique to the individual but are also related between pairs of individuals who
are themselves closely connected somehow (and thus non-random). This particular problematic
in the public sphere where there uses of data and analytics are held to the most stringent levels of
accountability.

The most obvious example is the human genome. Consider the UK Police National DNA
Database. This holds DNA profiles and relevant DNA samples from a select number of UK
individuals. It is the largest database of its kind in the world and it is continuing to grow each year.
Every profile in the database is derived from a sample collected from a crime scene or a police
suspect. There are many people who are against the idea of extending the DNA database because
of the potential threat it has to citizens’ privacy [35] and the risk of data abuse is potentially high.
But that is not our principal concern here. In fact in 2012, the UK Protection of Freedoms Bill aimed
to redress the balance between the state’s duty to protect the public and an individual’s right to
privacy. As a consequence 1766000 DNA profiles taken from innocent adults and children were
deleted from the database.

The problem we raise here is that if you have a close relative in the database, then you may be
identifiable from that profile. Although DNA is unique (except for identical twins) a close familial
relationships between pairs of individuals can be inferred. In [36], there is a discussion of many of
the ethical issues surrounding familial searching on the UK Police National DNA Database. This,
in turn, calls for much further thought about any other type of individuals’ data that may infer


relational (conditional) identities of other people should it be stored and exploited. This is leading Ee
