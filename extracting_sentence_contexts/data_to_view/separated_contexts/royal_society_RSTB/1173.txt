It is conceivable
that such long internuncial fibres exist, and, if so, then impulses which subsequently
become motor are conveyed by them. These impulses, although afferent in the sense
that they are actually travelling up the cord, are analogous in character with all the
motor or outgoing impulses, since they occupy that relation to the centres from which
they started. Without insisting on these hypothetical fibres, we may again point out that the
anatomical evidence becomes vague when some of the links in the chain are wanting,
hence all conclusions founded upon it must be used with the greatest caution. ‘The
facts which it surely evidences are—

1. That there are continuous fibres in the cord.

2. That these fibres do not cross from one side of the cord to the other.

3.
