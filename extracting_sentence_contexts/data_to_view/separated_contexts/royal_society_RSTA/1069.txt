The uncertainty relations make these measurements complementary: mutually exclusive
yet allowing us to performing either of them at any moment in time. Indeed, in Bohrâ€™s
view, one not only cannot measure both variables simultaneously but also cannot define them
simultaneously. Complementarity is, thus, as a reflection of the fact that, in a radical departure from classical
physics or relativity, the behaviour of quantum objects of the same type, say, electrons, is not


governed by the same physical law in all contexts. On the other hand, the mathematical formalism 8 |
of QM offers correct probabilistic or statistical predictions (no other predictions are, again,

possible) in all contexts. This situation also responsible for and defines contextuality, which is a 3
statistical concept, as is, | argue, complementarity when used in QM, correlatively to an RWR-type 1S
view.
