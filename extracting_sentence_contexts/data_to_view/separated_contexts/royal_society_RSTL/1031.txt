And this weight turned into atmospheres, in the manner above
described, gives 34750 atmospheres for the measure of the force
which must have been exerted by the elastic fluid in bursting the
barrel. But this force, enormous as it may appear, must still
fall short of the real initial force of the elastic fluid generated in
the combustion of gunpowder, before it has begun to expand ;
for it is more than probable that the barrel was in fact burst
before the generated elastic fluid had exerted all its force, or
that this fluid would have been able to have burst a barrel still
stronger than that used in the experiment. â€”But I wave these
speculations in order to hasten to more interesting and more

satisfactory investigations. Passing over in silence a consider-

260 Count RumrorD's Experiments to determine

able number of promiscuous experiments, which having nothing
particularly remarkable in their results, could throw no new
light upon the subject, I shall proceed immediately to give an
account of a regular et of experiments, undertaken with a view
to the discovery of certain determined facts, and prosecuted
with unremitting perseverance. These experiments were made by my directions under the
immediate care of Mr. RE1cHENBACH, commandant of the corps
of artificers in the Elector's military service, and of Count
Sexer?, first lieutenant in the regiment of artillery.
