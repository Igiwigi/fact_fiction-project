Part XI.â€”On citromycetin, a new yellow colouring matter produced from glucose by species
of Citromyces. By Arruur CLEMENT HETHERINGTON and Haroitp RalstTRIcK. The genus Citromyces WEHMER comprises a number of species which were considered
by Weumer to be unique in the fact that they produce considerable quantities of citric
acid by the fermentation of sugar. Because of this, WEHMER gave to the genus the
name of Citromyces. The genus is closely related to Penicillium and Aspergillus, and
has in fact been dropped by THom in his recent book on the genus Penicillium (1929).
