Chirality pervades the natural world, from the enigmatic preferences of fundamental

forces [6,7] to the helices traced out by the arms of galaxies [8] and even the plates of : 2
Stegosaurus [9,10]. In particular, many molecules can enjoy a seemingly stable existence in either a =
left- or a right-handed form which are distinct mirror images of each other, as was established by : a
the pioneering works of Pasteur [11], van â€™t Hoff [12] and Le Bel [13]. These opposite enantiomers : 2
often interact rather differently with living things, as chirality is also inherent to life: amino acids, DS
sugars and other biomolecules besides are chiral and their chirality is crucial to their biological ih
function [14]. To give but one of many striking examples, one enantiomer of methamphetamine : 4
is recognized as being a harmful narcotic, whereas the other enantiomer is relatively harmless, : be
being employed, in fact, as a decongestant. The two enantiomers of a simple chiral molecule are 72

One of the principal means by which we are able to probe and harness molecular chirality
is through the use of light that is itself chiral. Circularly polarized light in particular, which
was discovered by Fresnel, is a truly chiral influence [2,15]. The electric- and magnetic-field
vectors trace out helices in space [16], which can be left- or right-handed. Well-established chiral
light-matter interactions include optical rotation, i.e. the differential refraction of left- and right-
handed circularly polarized light [17,18], circular dichroism, i.e. the differential absorption [19-22],
and Raman optical activity, ie. the differential Raman scattering [22-25]. Many other chiral
electromagnetic interactions exist, of course [2,26-32].

That light can carry a well-defined angular momentum was recognized by Poynting [33], who
