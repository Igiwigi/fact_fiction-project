ranged from 99 30” to 11" 30», and in two remarkable instances even beyond these
hours. On the 12th of October it turned at 9 P.M., and on the 9th of June at 12 p.M.;
both of these anomalies may have been produced by the state of the weather, there
having been a heavy thunder storm from 7® to 8" 30” on the 9th of June, and sevyeral
thunder storms round the horizon on the 12th of October, although not immediately
at Poona, The stationary period ranged from 0 to 60 minutes, but of the latter there
is only one instance in the Table, As in the preceding tides, the movement of the
mercury in equal periods of time manifested occasional irregularities, although the
thermometer remained stationary, or nearly s0. On the 6th of February the night
fall was 008 in 15 minutes, and on the 8th it was only -001 in 15 minutes ; in neither
instance was there any movement of the thermometer, whilst on the 10th of June,
between 10» 45m and 11 p.m., the barometric fall amounted to 010. From the above
facts, and they could be infinitely multiplied, it is clear there is not any positive uni-
formity in the oscillations of the mercurial column, nor in the duration of the sta-
tionary periods; nevertheless as the irregularities are hounded by comparatively
narrow limits, the movements may be considered subject to a general Jaw, the
rationale of which remains to be explained.

Experiments have determined that the diurnal atmospheric tides (the nocturnal
tides have been less attended to) extend from the equator to high parallels of lati-
tude, but that the oscillation decreases as the latitude increases. It is further pre-
swned that the oscillation gradually diminishes in ascending from the level of the sea
to great heights. Professor James Fores of Edinburgh has laid down an assumed
curve, in which the diurnal oscillation amounts to 1190 at the equator, and ni at
latitude 64* 8' N.; and beyond that latitude the tide occurs with a contrary sign,
