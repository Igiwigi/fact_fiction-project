increases to about 0-5 at approximately 1000 km from the transmitter. The theory predicts
the gradual increase of | R,, | for 16 kc/s (see figure 8), and likewise figure 18 demonstrates
the increase of | R,, | for 80kc/s with large angles of incidence, once the dip is passed. We
can make no statement concerning this dip (caused by interference between the two regions) ;
results of observations on vertical and oblique incidence propagation during the same night
are not available.

Experimentally, it is found that at vertical incidence, | R,, | decreases slightly with in-
crease of frequency under night-time conditions. The theory does not predict this decrease;
for at vertical incidence | R,, | = | p,,| tends asymptotically with frequency to the value of
0-5 (see (9-1)). This lack of agreement can be accounted for either by assuming, as suggested
in § 1, that there is an absorbing region at a level below those considered in this paper, or
by the fact that there is a slight effect in region IT caused by the collision frequency; but
the approximations needed for the two regions to separate demand that this collision fre-
quency should be neglected.* For vertical incidence only, Stanley (1950) has given the
complete solution for the case of an exponential variation of electron density with height,
and his formulae show there is no asymptotic approach to the value 0:5 provided the
collision frequency is sufficient.

Experimentally, the apparent height corresponding to R,, is known within 5km to be
the same for 16 and 80kc/s as measured at a distance of 90km. For angles of incidence up
to 65° on 16kc/s, the apparent height is constant, but for angles greater than 65° results
cannot be obtained, due to the multiple reflexion of waves and to fading. For frequencies
near 80 kc/s the results analyzed so far for night-time conditions suggest that the apparent
height falls slightly with increase of angle of incidence for angles greater than about 45°.+
