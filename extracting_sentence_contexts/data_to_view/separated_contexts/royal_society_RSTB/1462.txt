These larvee have the merit of being ve
hardy, and they develop readily from artificial fertilisations without any speci
precautions being taken. Moreover, it was found that these artificial fertilisation
could be effected at all times of the year, irrespective of season. The chief objectio
to the choice of this animal lies in the fact that the growth of the larvee cannot
carried to the adult stage, so that it is only possible to measure the effect of enyiro
ment at a particular period in their development. The plan of operations was very simple. About six or eight sea-urchins, whieh
as a rule, had been freshly obtained the same morning, were cut open, and pieces of
ovaries of each of the three or four female specimens shaken with forceps in a sm
jar of sea-water.
