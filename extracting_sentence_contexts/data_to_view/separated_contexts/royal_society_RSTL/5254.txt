This was
with fluid which had been obtained nearly an hour before it was employed. In a
further trial, with an isolated egg, to which a full quantity of fluid was added, by
three or four applications of the loaded pin's-head, after the egg had been one minute
in the water, I detected several spermatozoa, within half an hour afterwards, sticking
like the preceding into the vitelline membrane, and this egg also produced a good
embryo. It was thus evident, that in some cases, spermatozoa certainly penetrated through
X the envelope; but as there was also one instance, in which the egg had hecome
fecundated, and afterwards produced an embryo, in which I had not seen sperma-
> tozoa within the envelopes, it was necessary to pursue the investigation further, to be
: quite assured of the fact of penetration as connected with the act of fecundation. On the following day an opportunity occurred to me of examining the egg after
= impregnation by the natural union of the sexes. I had several pairs of frogs in
a basin of water covered by a glass bell jar.
