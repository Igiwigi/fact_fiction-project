Thus our conclusion is strengthened that the soil solutions experimented upon do
represent the natural solution existing in the soil in situ.

We may now consider how far these results bear on the theory that crops leave
behind in the soil specific toxins which depress the growth of succeeding crops of the
same kind. In Series I wheat and barley yielded almost exactly the same weight of
plant, whether they grow in solutions from the wheat or the barley soils (Table 1).
As a rule the wheat plants were a little heavier when grown in the solutions from the
barley soils than when grown in solutions from the corresponding wheat. soils
(3 compares with 1, 0, 11 with 2a, 7 with 44, 2 with 7/2), but the barley plants were
similarly heavier in the solutions from the barley soils. The ratio of root to shoot is
very close in the two sets. Again, wheat and barley grown in the same solution yield
weights agreeing within the range of error of such experiments. These facts alone
would dismiss the hypothesis that the wheat soils contain any soluble toxin injurious
to wheat but not to barley, and vice versd, notwithstanding the 60 yearsâ€™ repeated
growth of these crops on the same soils. In Series Il the demonstration was pushed
a stage further by including in the comparison an artificial culture solution made from
pure salts and containing phosphoric acid and potash in the same proportions as the
solutions from the completely manured plots. Another set of the soil solutions was
boiled before use, since boiling had been reputed to destroy the toxin and would at
any rate kill off any bacteria that might be factors in the result. Lastly in another
set the solutions were evaporated, the residue ignited and dissolved afresh in a
minimum quantity of hydrochloric acid, then diluted to the original volume. The
results obtained are set out in Table VII.
