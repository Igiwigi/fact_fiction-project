very young, and were thus brought up for nearly the whole period of larval life in
unnatural conditions. In the following experiments I made use of larvae which were
fuund in various localities near Oxford, and which were allowed to remain upon the
nettle-bed until they were nearly mature. In this way I secured a very high
percentage of pup. Nevertheless, in the experiments just recorded (II.), that
insight into the colour sensitiveness of the species was gained which rendered all the
following experiments possible and suggested the various modifications and details.

III.—A company of mature larvee was found August 15 beside the towing-path of
the “ Upper River,” near Oxford. In the press of other work they were in some cases
temporarily placed in short, wide, glass cylinders, covered with sheets of glass, until the
night of August 16, when they were counted and to some extent re-arranged, but in
the meantime they had ceased to feed ; in fact, the great majority did not eat anything
at all after capture. They were arranged as follows, and were all compared August 21,
both together and with those of Series IT.

A. A clear glass cylinder was employed, 2:07 decimetres in internal diameter and
7°0 centimetres in height. This was placed upon a floor of white paper, upon
which a small quantity of the food-plant was lying horizontally, and the cylinder
was covered with a sheet of white translucent “ opal” glass, forming the roof. The
larvee described in this division, although first counted and noted on the night of
August 16, had previously been in the same cylinder with the same white roof
(although without the paper floor, as the cylinder merely rested on the ordinary floor
boarding of the room). On the night of the 16th they were placed on a table about
six feet from a very large window, so as to be exposed to a good east light during the
