This answer is given by interpreting the symbol with
reference to the results of the operations. The unit of water (Sec. I. Def. 10), we may
reply to such a question, is an integral compound weight (Sec. T. Def. 7) of which the
whole is identical with the two simple weights (Sec. I. Def. 8) « and £ of Section VII.,
which we recognize as simple weights from the fact that in the total system of chemical
transformations these weights are not distributed (Sec. I. Def. 12). The science of
Chemistry, we may add, affords no further information whatever as to the composition
of water than that which is comprised in this assertion, which is not only the true but
the only real form of answer which it is possible to give to inquiries as to the chemical
composition of ponderable matter. There is no difference whatever, as regards facts,
between this and the preceding statement; the difference lies in the way in which the
facts are regarded.
