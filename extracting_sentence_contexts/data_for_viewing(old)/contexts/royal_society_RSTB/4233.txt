almost entirely to the action of the factor on a single characteristic, namely, the
height of the main stem. ;

Effect of the Depressant Factor on Height.

Tn fig. 12 we have made a schematic representation of the manner in which height
is affected by the depressant factor. This schema is based upon the data presented
in Tables IIIâ€”V, and on the discussions of the evidence obtained on pp. 425-428. It
does not, however, pretend to be an exact presentation of the experimental data.
Portions for which no statistical observations are available have been filled in on the
basis of previous discussion.

Further, in it we have disregarded the fact that the earliest sowings become
actually shorter than middle sowings, and have represented them as being all of the
same height. This has been done simply for convenience in construction of the
figure, as it does not affect the general argument.

On examining this schema we see that the general form of the height curve of all
sowings is sigmoid, with a period of maximum elongation in the centre, where the
curve is steepest. One of us has elsewhere* pointed out that the acceleration of
elongation represented by the early rise of the curve can be largely accounted for by
the rise in night temperature which takes place as the summer comes on; and that
the falling off of the latter part of the curve may be explained as due to some
internally-developed toxin, localised in the terminal bud, possibly a thermotoxin.
