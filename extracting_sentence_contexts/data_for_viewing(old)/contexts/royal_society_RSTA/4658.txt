of basic physical and social issues are needed to help motivate and acquaint the wider scientific
community with the underlying challenges. Getting people to heed warning remains a formidable
undertaking, particularly for smaller events.

As in Synolakis & Kanoglu [20], it is clear that what is missing in contemporary hazard
assessments are regulatory guidelines for the training of the scientists and engineers who work
on estimating the maximum probable tsunami. The online free availability of computational tools
has made it easy to model physical phenomena, sometimes with disastrous consequences. The
outputs of different numerical methodologies may differ slightly, for the same initial conditions,
but these differences dwarf the uncertainties in source characterization, or differences in results
when convergence is not checked, or when inexperienced people use them. The latter requires
context and experience. While likely hundreds of thousands have played with games such as
‘flight simulator’, rigorous training is required to allow the same to fly real airplanes, and in fact
only a fraction do.

Ending, we are reminded of the tribal communities of the Indian Ocean and islands, such as
in the Andamans or the Solomons, with no access to modern warning systems. The former fared

the latter routinely self-evacuated during several tsunamis in the past decade. They considered
the unusual water motions as signs of impending disaster. Their instincts were ‘perfected over
