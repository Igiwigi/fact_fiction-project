In addition to the present memoir, this desire hag
resulted in the discovery and description* of 100 new species of free Nematoid®
partly marine and partly freshwater; and my researches on this branch of the
subject have convinced me that these may be considered to constitute one of the mogt
numerous and widely distributed families in the whole animal kingdom, yielding in this
respect, perhaps, only to the ubiquitous Diatomacez in the vegetable world. Their
bodies are 80 transparent, and enticing for microscopical examination, that I was tempted
on and on, far beyond the limits I had originally intended, in the hopes of being able
to learn something from them concerning the moot points in Nematoid anatomy. But
although many interesting facts have been thus acquired, still more have been gathered
from my later investigations into the structure of the parasitic Nematoids—thoughy
fortunately, the two sets of observations mutually throw light on one another. The recognition of the great numerical abundance and wide distribution of these free
Nematoids tends to throw much additional interest over the order Nematoidea, and
make the Nematoids as a group quite unique among other animals; for in them we ee
a great asxemblage, one division of which has long been known to constitute a section
of the class Entozoa, most remarkable for the number of its representatives and the
frequency with which they are met in the most varied organs of animals belonging to
every grade from the Acalephe upwards; whilst the other is now, also, known to be
composed of animals, in all probability infinitely more numerous still, leading a free
and independent life in all stages of their existence, tenanting almost every variety of
natural external habitat where moisture exists, and even invading in some cages, as para
sites, representatives of the vegetable kingdom. Yet, strange to 8ay, the organization of
these latter animals, as a whole, differs in no very obyious or important manner from that
of their parasitic kindred.
