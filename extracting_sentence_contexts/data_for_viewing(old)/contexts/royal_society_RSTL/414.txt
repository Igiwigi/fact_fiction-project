distances of the two sets of primaries ; their dimensions were
from two to three times the diameters of the primaries from
which they appeared to originate, sometimes only one set
appeared, sometimes two, and at other times a third very
faintly.

On first observing these new rings, it was found, that on
moving the eye in a horizontal direction to the right or left,
they sometimes moved 2th, and sometimes contrary to the
motion of the eye; others were stationary, although the eye
moved; also, that sometimes the prismatic colours were seen
in the usual order, and at other times inverted ; all of which
facts seemed not a little perplexing at that time; but their
causes will be better understood from what follows.

Exp. 7. By a subsequent- experiment, it was discovered,
that those rings towards the circumference of the new sets
had their colours. always in the usual order; but that those
nearest the centres had their colours always inverted; that
the number of rings of each class were equal : that they all

sets of rings with each other, from which intersections they
