For demonstrating the effect of higher lateral and axial resolution of ISM on biological samples, : w
we use Silicon Rhodamine (SiR) Actin [27] labelled HeLa cells and record an ISM imaging :sS
data stack. To compare different reconstruction methods to classical widefield fluorescence data :8
(figure 4e), we use three different reconstruction algorithms: : S

1. Super confocal imaging [28]: Here, the stack is processed by applying maxz(Istack(Z)) +
minz(Istack(Z)) — 2*meanz(Istack(Z)). It exploits the fact that a sample position in ISM is
most of the time not illuminated when in focus in this sparse illumination scheme. This
successfully reduces background contributions and offers a fast and simple way to obtain
good sectioning (figure 4f).

2. Classical ISM photon reassignment: We base our algorithm on work by McGregor eft al.
[20]. Here, we first register individual illumination positions (i.e. peaks, figure 4a) in each
frame, before a grating is fit into this pattern to recover undetected illumination spots at
the gratings crossings and to allow for distortions (e.g. field curvature) originating from
the freeform optics or improper alignment (figure 4c). A snippet of 11 x 11 pixels” around
each detected peak position is cut-out, multiplied with a two-dimensional Gaussian to
simulate a ‘macro-pinhole’ [20,30] for better axial sectioning, summed and reassigned
on a two times super sampled canvas (figure 4c). Reassigning the information for all
