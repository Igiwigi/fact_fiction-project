Hence, finally, the fraction of the atom which is effective is a*c*/(a*c? +n*x*),

Now we have to explain two things: in the first place, the fact that for a given
spacing the intensities of the various orders fall off as the inverse square, in the second
the fact that the intensities of two spectra of the same order belonging to different
spacings are proportional to the squares of the spacings. For in practice we find
