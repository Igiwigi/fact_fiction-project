Table 7. Regression coefficients for the effect of contact reductions and contact tracing parameters and strategies on growth rates across models with household
structure, household-level tracing and different tracing strategies. Some parameters were fixed as described in table 1 and other parameters were varied as
described in table 2. We performed 100 simulations for each model, with 5000 starting infections and estimated the growth rates using days 10-25 of the
simulation. Note that the intercept has no interpretation because we do not simulate scenarios with no contact tracing here.
