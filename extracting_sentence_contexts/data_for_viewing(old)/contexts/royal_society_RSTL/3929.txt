of half an equivalent of each ; but is sometimes brought about by the transfer of a
whole equiyalent of the anion to the zincode, whereby a whole equivalent of the
cation is left uncombined at the platinode ; or by transfer of unequivalent portions of
each in opposite directions, making however together a whole equivalent of matter
transferred to one electrode or the other ; or speaking more correctly, by the transfer
of a quantity of matter capable of exerting one equivalent of chemical force, s0 that
when the anion transferred to the zincode exceeds half an equivalent, the cation trans-
ferred to the platinode is in an equal proportion less than half an equivalent, and
vice versd ; the anion and cation set free being always in equivalent proportions. We
have, however, in no case observed the transfer of a whole equivalent of the cation to
the exclusion of the anion.

These facts are, we believe, irreconcilable with any of the molecular hypotheses
which have hitherto been imagined to account for the phenomena of electrolysis, nor
have we anything more satisfactory at present to substitute for them ; we shall there-
fore prefer leaving them to the elucidation of further investigation, to adding one
more to the already too numerous list of hasty generalizations.
