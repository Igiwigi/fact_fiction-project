It is of importance to notice that the nictitans invariably moves
from below upwards, and not horizontally or obliquely from the inner angle across the
eye, asis the case in all birds and many of the mammals. Moreover, the nictitans is more
or less transparent, or at least translucent, so that the details of the iris can frequently
be seen through it; but, on the other hand, it is never so thin as not to impair vision to
some extent. The nictitans is usually bordered along its free edge with pigment of a
brilliantly spotted bronze colour, but in some of the Hylide (eg., H. carulea) the
edge is bright green ; in fact, this ventral lid behaves like a lower lid and nictitans
combined. It may be remembered that in those sharks which possess a large nictitans,
the outside of this membrane is covered with the same kind of minute placoid scales, as
is the outer surface of the lower lid. The Crocodiles have a well-developed typical nictitans, which moves obliquely
backwards and slightly upwards.
