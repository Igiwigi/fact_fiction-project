ON THE EXPERIMENTAL HYBRIDIZATION OF ECHINOIDS. 297

S. franciscanus Â¢ x S. purpuratus 2. . Moorr (64), repeating this cross the
following year, experienced the same difficulty ; the larvee were, with a few
exceptions, pathological.

In our preliminary paper we said that the evidence from our crosses seemed to
support the contentions of Lorn, Kiya, and Moorg, but that in our crosses the female
seemed to have a stronger influence than the male. In re-examining the matter this
year we have come to the conclusion that the evidence is not really strong enough to
warrant our maintaining this view. An examination of text-figs. 1-9 will make this
plain. These figures will show, however, how exceedingly difficult it is to draw
definite conclusions from the skeletons of the hybrids, owing to the fact that in any
particular cross the individuals vary so widely among themselves.

We give a series of drawings of the aboral ends of the body-rods in F. esculentus,
E. acutus, and E. miliaris, and all the hybrid crosses between these species, about
40 examples being shown of each (text-figs. 1-9). It will be seen from these figures
that the aboral ends of the body-rods in E. esculentus may be described as slender,
rather spinous, and arched. H. acutus is slightly clubbed, very spinous, and slightly
arched. #. muliaris is clubbed, smooth, and straight. Thus we make out three
pairs of characters: namely, clubbed and slender, spinous and smooth, and arched and
straight (text-figs. 1-3).

In the first place, #. acutus has a skeleton which is slightly clubbed and slightly
