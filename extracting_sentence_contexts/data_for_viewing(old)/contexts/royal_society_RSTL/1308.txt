* On referring afterwards to Dr. Tromson's System of Chemistry (Vol. V. page
491), I find that a very similar explanation of the coagulation of albumen has been
offered by that author, which the following experiments will likewise confirm.

application of electricity, from sixty four inch double plates,
a copious coagulation took place at the negative pole.

So that water, in which the coagulated white of egg has
been boiled, is in fact an extremely dilute alkaline solution of
albumen.

This enables us also to explain why albumen becomes co-
agulated simply by heat.

When the coagulated white of egg is cut into pieces, a small
quantity of a brown viscid fluid gradually separates from it,
as has been observed by Dr. BosTock in his paper on the pri-
mary animal fluids.* This I find to consist principally of an
alkaline solution of albumen. It reddens turmeric, and coagu-
lates abundantly on the application of negative electricity.
