concrete impression of such developing structures. It is the more important in this

3â€”The Dentition of the Monotremes

Far from the least of my reasons for undertaking this investigation is the intrinsic
interest of the monotreme dentition; this, in fact, provided my original stimulus. The Monotremata occupy a particularly interesting position in the Class Mammalia:
though specialized in their adaptations to their modes of life, they are undoubtedly

reptilian features which they retain. The characters of the teeth form the main clues to the interrelationships of the fossil
mammals of the Mesozoic era.
