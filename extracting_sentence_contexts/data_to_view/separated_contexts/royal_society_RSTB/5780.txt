It was, therefore, rather a surprise to find
that these C.M.V. 6 cells were nearly saturated at 6 or 8 volts. They might certainly
be used with safety at 10 volts. The advantage lies in being able to use a smaller, and
far lighter, high-tension battery, where portability is important, and in the fact that
“dark” currents become of much less importance with such a low voltage. In this
work they were, however, operated at 60 volts, like photometer H, to avoid altering the
plug, since the use of the heater prevented any dark current. The results for ultra-violet radiation, Series 76 and 81, were obtained by the use of a
Burt sodium vacuum cell of thin soda glass and a G.E.C. potassium vacuum cell
respectively.
