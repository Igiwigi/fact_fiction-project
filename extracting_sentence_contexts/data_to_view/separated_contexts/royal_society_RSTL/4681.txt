This opinion has been advocated with considerable ability by MM. Worey and
STRECKER. I have however reason to suppose that purpurine is in fact no distinct
snbstance, but a mixture of alizarine and verantine. The latter snbstance accompanies
almost all the products which are obtained from madder, and it is this body which
renders them 80 difficult to purify. It adheres s0 pertinaciously to alizarine, as to in-
duce the belief that the two actually form a chemical compound.
