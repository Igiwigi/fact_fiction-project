Figure 6. Examples of the time series of the X variable in the Lorenz model, evolving on the Lorenz
attractor for (a) no external forcing and for (6) strong external forcing. Changes in probability of
the upper regime/lower regime are affected predictably by the imposed ‘forcing’.

enables the forecast probabilities to be calibrated based on past performance and
the model bias to be corrected. However, these empirical correction methods are
essentially linear and yet we know that the real system is highly nonlinear. As
Turner et al. [16] have demonstrated, there is inherently much more predictive
skill if improvements in model formulation could be made that reduce these biases,
rather than correcting them after the fact.

It is also the case that model-specific biases, both in the mean state and in the
internal variability, lead to under-dispersion in the ensemble. This has led to the
use of multi-model ensembles in which the differing model-specific biases allow
the forecast phase space to be sampled more completely with therefore greater
reliability in the ensemble prediction system [17]. However, it has to be recognized
