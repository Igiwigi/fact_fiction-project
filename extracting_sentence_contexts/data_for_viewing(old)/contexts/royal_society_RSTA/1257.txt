2-smooth and include L1() for 2 < q < p < oo and the Besov spaces Bs ,(R*) for2<q<r<p<oo.
In the converse direction, it is not true that all 2-smooth spaces satisfy the twice differentiability
condition; an abstract counterexample follows from [59, Theorem 3.9] (see also [60, Example 1.1]).
In the Besov scale, the twice differentiability condition is unclear if 2 <1 <q < oo, even though
the space Bs ,(R*) is 2-smooth in that case, too. The approach based on It6’s formula extends to
evolution families, but has the general drawback that it does not seem to give the optimal growth
rate O(,/p) of the constant as expected from the Burkholder—Davis—Gundy inequalities as p > oo.
As discussed in §4b, for Cp-contraction semigroups on Hilbert spaces a new proof of the maximal
inequality for exponents 0 < p < oo giving growth of order O(,/p) was obtained by Hausenblas &
Seidler [39].

The approach via It6’s formula was once more revisited in [60], where it was finally extended
to arbitrary 2-smooth Banach spaces by exploiting the fact that, in such spaces, for 2 < p < 00
the mapping xt> ||x||? is once continuously Fréchet differentiable with a Lipschitz continuous
derivative. As it turns out, this already suffices to prove a version of the It6 formula with the
help of which the argument can be completed. This approach, however, does not seem to give the
optimal p-dependence of the constant as p — oo.

(b) The It6 formula approach revisited

The aim of the present subsection is to present the It6 formula approach to maximal estimates
for stochastic convolutions. In comparison with Theorem 5.2, it does not lead to new results (in
fact we need stronger assumptions on the evolution family and obtain non-optimal asymptotic
dependence of the constant), but this approach has the merit that it can be extended to
random Co-evolution families of contractions. To the best of our knowledge, for this setting no
