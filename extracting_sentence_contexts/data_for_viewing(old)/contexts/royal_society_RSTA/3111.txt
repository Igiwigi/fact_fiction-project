In §2, I will briefly review the theory that leads to a five-moment description of
hydrodynamics. These are standard results that cover the definition of the macroscopic variables,
the derivation of the balance laws and the form of the probability distribution function (PDF) at
each spatial point. In §3, I will address the following question:

If every point of a finite volume has a (local) equilibrium PDF for velocity with spatially
varying parameters of density, bulk velocity and internal energy, what is the form of the
PDF for the entire volume?

I will show that the volume-averaged PDF explicitly depends upon the spatial gradients even
though those gradients are absent from single-point distributions. In §4, I will perform the
spatial averaging of the balance laws over finite volumes. That averaging is complicated by the
nonlinearity of the equations and by the fact that the velocity field is not necessarily smooth on
length scales of the mean free path.

The remarkable result of all these calculations is that the macroscopic equations are precisely
those derived in [4] by finite-scale coarse-graining of the NSE. In §5, I will describe their relation to
the regularized Euler equations that form the basis of most numerical simulations of fluid flows.
I will also describe an important property of those equations, enslavement, which indicates that
some large-scale features of a flow may control the smaller-scale mechanisms of dissipation. I will
conclude the paper in §6 with a short summary.
