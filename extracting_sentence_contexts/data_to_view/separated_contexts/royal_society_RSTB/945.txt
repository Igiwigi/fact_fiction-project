of the mesenteric and visceral vessels, which the splanchnic stimulation provokes
administration and stimulation are simultaneous, reduces the free passage of the |
laden with nitrite vapour to the arterioles, and, therefore, must limit the local ef
which the drug is capable of producing. It is difficult to see what satisfact
explanation can be given by the advocates of an exclusively central cause of the |
of pressure which occurs during simultaneous nitrite inhalation and splanchnic sti
lation, unless they recognise a vascular area more capacious than that dominated
the splanchnic, and beyond its control, which is relaxed by such a central effect,
less capacious area were relaxed, the splanchnic territory being unimpaired in activit
stimulation of the latter ought clearly to obviate the nitrite fall produced elsewhere

The initial rise occurring from stimulation of the splanchnic at the same time
nitrite was given is succeeded by a fall, whilst the stimulation is maintained; th
is, therefore, an instant during which the original level of blood pressure is crossed. the decline progresses.
