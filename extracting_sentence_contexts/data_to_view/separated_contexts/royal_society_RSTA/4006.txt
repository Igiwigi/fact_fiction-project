We have
obtained a very large value of approximately 18 J (K kg kbar)~! for the MnNiSi-based compound,
approximately 2J(Kkgkbar)~! for LaFeSi-hydride and negative low values, approximately
â€”1.8] (Kkg kbar)", for the remaining compounds. In the case of Heusler alloys, the influence of a magnetic field on the elastocaloric effect induced
by the application of uniaxial compressive stress has been reported in [22]. In spite of the fact that
only relatively low stresses (about 10 MPa) were applied owing to poor mechanical properties
characteristic of this class of materials, results provide evidence for a significant elastocaloric effect
associated with the large entropy change at the magnetostructural phase transition undergone by
the material. Interestingly, application of a magnetic field below 1T was found to increase the
elastocaloric relative cooling power by about 20%. Similarly, the effect of an applied electric field
on the elastocaloric response of ferroelectric Pb(Mnq/3Nb2/3)03-32PbTiO; single crystals induced
by uniaxial compressive stress has been reported in [23].
