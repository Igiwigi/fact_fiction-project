It was upon the above statements that I adopted, by
way of precaution, the method of using the gold-leaf electrometer in experiment (F.),
fig. 12. My subsequent researches, however, with electrified bodies in receiyers, more
or less exhausted of the contained air, led me to investigate this point very rigorously;
and I am inclined to think that the following fact, taken in connexion with the pre-
ceding (44. 74. 75.), will go far to show, that any explanation of the phenomenon
of electrical divergence involving the necessity of an atmospheric action, upon any
principle of mechanism whatever, is likely to be quite fallacious. (z.) Two gold-leaves were suspended in free space from a stout brass wire supported
horizontally on a long insulating stem of glass: these being electrified 80 as to diverge
freely, were covered by a capacious receiver, made extremely dry, and somewhat warm
within ; the insulating glass stem also being varnished, was warmed with a stick of
burning charcoal.
