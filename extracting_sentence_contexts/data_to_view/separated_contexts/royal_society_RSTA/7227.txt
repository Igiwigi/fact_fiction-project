If observations with solutions of extreme dilution, i.e. less than
2-2 10-5Â¢./ml., are excluded the agreement between all estimates of the ionic yield made
at the same or closely similar enzyme concentrations, even though separated in time by
periods up to 2 years, are consistent with the estimated standard error of the determination
of each enzyme activity. RESULTS

In table 2 will be found figures representing enzyme activities A, and A before and after
irradiation by X-, f- and a-radiation. These figures are, in fact, the values in ml. of
0-02 n-NaOH used to titrate the amide linkages of the substrate split after digestion with
enzyme. Other columns in the table give the dose of radiation delivered, the estimated
inactivation dose D, the concentration of enzyme C, and the specific inactivation dose D/C. In the case of the X-ray data the experiments have been grouped in such a way as to
provide a smaller number of more accurate estimates of the specific inactivation dose,
spaced at convenient intervals over the whole range of concentration investigated.
