As an 7deal of this form, I hall only adduce the painted female
figure upon the back of the sarcophagusof Capt. LeTwzuLLIER's
mummy in the British Museum, which has been engraved by
VERTvE, and which most strikingly agrees with the unequi-
vocal national form of the Hindoos, which, especially in Eng-
land, is s0 often to be seen upon Indian paintings. (See fig. 2.)

The third sort of Egyptian configuration is not similar to
either of the preceding ones, but seems to partake something
of both, which must have been owing to the modifications pro-
duced by local circumstances in a foreign climate. This is
characterized by a peculiar turgid habit, flabby cheeks, a short
chin, large prominent eyes, and rather a plump make in the
person.-F This, as may naturally be expected, is the structure
most frequently to be met with. (See fig. g.)

I thought this little digression the less intrusive, as it appears
to me that it may on the one hand prove useful, not only to-
wards illustrating the history of the origin and descent of the
nations that were transplanted into Egypt, and have acquired
the general denomination of Egyptians, but also for the de-
termination of the different periods of the syle of the arts of the
ancient Egyptians, concerning which we have as yet very im-
perfect ideas; whilst, on the other hand, it might lead to much
accurate information as to matter of fact, many very eminent
authors having given the most mncongruous representations of
the Egyptian national character, &uch as WIXNKELMANN for

mere defect in the drawing ; no doubt an excellent expedient this, to get rid of diffi-
culties in the investigation of national varieties,
