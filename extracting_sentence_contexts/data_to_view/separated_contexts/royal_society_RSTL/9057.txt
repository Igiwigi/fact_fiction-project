Again, paring down
the contractile tisxues from around a single lithocyst has the effect, when the tissue is
greatly reduced, of giving rise to enormously long periods of inactivity. During s8uch
a period, however, stimulation may initiate a bout of rhythmical contractions, to be fol-
lowed by another prolonged pause. These facts tend to show that the apparently
automatic action of the lithocysts is really due to a constant stimulation supplied by
other parts of the organism. Temperature exerts a profound influence on the rate of the rhythm. This influence
may be best obseryed within moderate limits of variation; for water below 20* suspends
spontaneity and even irritability, while water above 70* permanently slows the rhythm
