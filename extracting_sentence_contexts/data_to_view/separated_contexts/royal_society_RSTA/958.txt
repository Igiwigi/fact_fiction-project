The
straight lines are the small-z approximations given by equation (2.5). The dots denote results obtained by numerical simulation
of the equations using an Euler forward difference scheme, with as initial condition a step function. (Online version in colour.)

The above equation has been solved numerically. The minimal speed cm =cm(t) is shown in
figure 2 for two different values of y together with their local approximation

cm =2—(y +2)t + O(t?) (t > 0). (2.5)


The expression (2.5) clearly illustrates the fact that the minimal speed is decreasing with the ls |
delay. Equation (2.4) is obtained as follows: first, we switch to travelling wave coordinates by

substituting z = x + ct in equation (2.3), then we linearize the resulting equation around u = 0 and 3

is of no interest since u is a population and thus needs to remain positive.
