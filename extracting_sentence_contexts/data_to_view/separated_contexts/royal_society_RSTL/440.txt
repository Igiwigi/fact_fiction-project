The
position of this chemist, however, has been too generally ex-
tended by him. If the power of masses were as great as he
represents it to be, and if it increased ad infinitum, in proportion

From the experiments which I have related, it appears to be
proved. 18t. That there exists an affinity between silica and alumina,
