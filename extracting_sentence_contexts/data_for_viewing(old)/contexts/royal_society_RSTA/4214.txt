apply the same rotation to both magnets B; and Bz. Expressing this invariance with respect
to rotations of the coordinate system (Euclidean space and Cartesian coordinates are used
throughout this paper) in terms of i-probs yields P(x, y| a1,a2,Z) = P(x, y| a1, Zaz, Z), where @
denotes an arbitrary rotation in three-dimensional space which is applied to both magnets By,
and By, implying that P(x,y|a;,a2,Z) is a function of the inner product aj - az only. Therefore,
we must have P(x, y|a1,a2,Z) = P(x,y| a1 - a2,Z) = P(x,y|0,Z), where 6 = arccos(aq - az) denotes
the angle between the unit vectors aj and az. Note that for any integer value of K, 6 + 27K
represents the same physical arrangement of the magnets M; and Mp. From the algebra of
LI, it follows that the i-prob to observe x, irrespective of the observed value of y, is given
by P(x|a1,a2,Z) = Ly=#1 P(x,y|a1,a2,Z). In the context of the EPRB experiment, it is assumed
that observing x= +1 is as likely as observing x= —1, independent of the observed value of
y. This implies that we must have P(x = +1|a1,a2,Z) = P(x =—1|a1,a2,Z) which, in view of
the fact that P(x = +1|ay,a2,Z) + P(x =—1|a),a2,Z) =1 implies that P(x =+1|a,,a2,Z) =P(x=
—1|ay,a,Z)= 3 Applying the same reasoning to the assumption that, independent of the
observed values of x, observing y= +1 is as likely as observing y=~—1 yields P(y|aj,a2,Z) =
P(x =+1,y | a1, a2,Z) + P(x =—1,y|a1,a2,Z) = 1. Note that we did not assign any prior i-prob


nor did we make any reference to concepts such as the singlet state. Although the symmetry
properties which have been assumed are reminiscent of those of the singlet state, this is deceptive:
without altering the assumptions, the LI approach also yields the correlations for the triplet
states [22].

Adopting the same reasoning as in §2b, it follows directly from assumptions (a)-(d) that the
i-prob to observe a pair {x,y} takes the form [22] P(x,y|6,Z) =[1 + xyE12(0)]/4, where E2(0) =
