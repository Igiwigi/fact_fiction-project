We set Q = P99 and b = 6P 229, where P299 and P29 are determined via Raman spectroscopy in [6]. : Ss
A schematic of the molecular frame with respect to the director frame used in the derivation of :s
order parameters is shown in figure 3. For these parameters, Q = 1 corresponds to perfect nematic 1S

order while Q = 0 is when mesogens are randomly oriented, and if b = 0, then the system reduces
to the uniaxial case.

Setting the nematic director in the reference and current configuration as ng = [0, 1,0]? and
n=[cos6,sin0,0]', respectively, where @ € [0, 2/2], the deformation gradient takes the form

F =diag(A1,A2,43), (3.1)

where 41A2A3 = 1. In fact, for the uniaxial deformation under consideration, all tensors involved
share the same principal directions, and thus, are all diagonal.
In the reference configuration, the LCE is uniaxial, and the order parameter tensor is equal to
[28, p. 14]:
F Qo Qo
Qo = diag | ->-,Q0,- J, (3.2)

where Qo is the scalar order parameter.
In the deformed configuration, when biaxiality emerges [28, p. 15]:

— If 6 =7/2, then the order parameter tensor takes the form
