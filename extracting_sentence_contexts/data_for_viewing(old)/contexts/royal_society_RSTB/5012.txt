RESIN CANALS IN THE CANADIAN SPRUCE (PICEA CANADENSIS), %

while, on the other hand, in the wood it affects the tracheary as well as the medullary
ray cell initials, resulting in two distinct types of resin structure, that of the horizontal
and that of the vertical series. One would think that even if the sieve tubes were
irresponsive to the stimulus to produce resin canals, the heavily food-laden parenchyma
cells of the bast might respond, but as has been shown above, these do not add to the
series of cells surrounding the resin-bulbs, which are wholly of ray origin. Moreover, it
may be added that the food supply theory fails to explain adequately the character of the
distribution of resin canals resulting from wounding. When a tree trunk produces resin
canals as a result of wounding, they centre not only in the region above the wound, but
also directly below it. In fact, there is no indication of a bifurcated arrangement below
the wound, as would be expected if the downward current of food were responsible for
their occurrence. In wounding of the root a similar condition obtains. These are
significant facts, indicating the existence of a stimulus acting apart altogether from
increased food supply.

From these more or less theoretical viewpoints, it would seem that the food supply
has little bearing on the problem of the production of resin canals. It must be conceded,
however, that the relative availability of the food material on the bast and on the wood
side of the cambium is a difficult matter to determine, and that it is perhaps better
to connect the food supply aspect with “ vigour of growth.” The latter, however, is
a lax term that its users have not troubled to define, and must be considered from as
many different aspects as possible. For example, vigour of growth may refer to growth
