The direct conversion of sugar into wax,
with the evolution of carbonic acid, is known to occur by the agency of bees. Sacus has shown that some 8eeds which contain no tannin develope that substance
during the first growth after germination, with a simultaneous disappearance of starch. The period at which it occurs would preclude the direct formation of tannin from
external sources. 'The tannins contain a less percentage of oxygen than the class of
carbohydrates; and their derivation from the latter, attended by the separation of car-
bonie acid, is an hypothesis s8upported by the facts of the case. Without assuming
unusual or improbable decompoxsitions, it is scarcely possible to explain such conversions,
unless this separation be assumed. The $tate in which the oxygen absorbed by the plant remains, until it is finally excreted
in combination with carbon, is a point of great interest.
