sections, somewhat irregularly cut, might also be thought to support this;
however, been shown that the cells marked (x) owe their appearance to the ob
direction in which the plane of section traverses the lateral parts of the sporang
and a similar consideration of the details in other cases suffices to show that i
species the sporogenous mass is referable in its origin entirely to the archespo
above described.
It is well known how ZL. Selago bears on one and the same axis successive |
and sterile zones ; the character of the leaves, however, varies but little, the &
foliage leaves being in all essential points similar to the sporophylls. An @
nation of the leaves about the limits of these zones shows that in the axils 0
apparently sterile, a more or less completely arrested sporangium is commonly |
found, so that the transition from the one to the other is a gradual one, The
fact, so easily observed in this species, is found also to hold for others,
importance will be brought out more prominently on a later page (p. 535).
