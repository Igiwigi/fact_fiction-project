Lests for Completeness.—Vhere is a simple and decisive way of testing in any given
case whether all the base surfaces of ¥ have been found. For as previously pointed out,
the residual surface of intersection of any two Y-primals is a V-surface, and this has
known order—equal in fact to that of the ®-surfaces; so that the complete system of
base surfaces of ‘’ must be such as to make the order of the general residual surface of inter-
section equal to that of the ®-surfaces. Another test applicable to the multiple base

* When a surface is represented on a plane, any point of the plane which corresponds to a line of the
surface is called a “ fundamental ” point of the plane.

} In fact the tangent cone to a ‘Y-primal at a point P of a base curve k will be composed of planes through
the tangent to k at P; so that all the points of the neighbourhood of P which lie in one of these planes
through the tangent will impose the same condition on V’-primals to contain them and will be represented
by the same point P’ of 8. Corresponding to the «2 planes through the tangent, then, we get » * points
forming an E-surface of S. Cf. Berrrt as quoted already.

surface is contained in the rule that ‘Y-primals have rational or elliptic plane sections
according as the prime sections of -surfaces are rational or elliptic.

As to the various other types of base elements which can occur in H-systems of primals,
