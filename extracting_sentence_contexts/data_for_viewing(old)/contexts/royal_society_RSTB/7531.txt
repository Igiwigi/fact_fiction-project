to the more numerous estimates based on single sections, it appears that the phyllotaxis
index of a typical Lupinus apex as used by Snow & Snow is about 3-2 to 3-3; in plan the 3:5
system of parastichies intersects at 100 to 105°.

A few longitudinal sections of Lupinus apices are presented by Snow & Snow, and others
are given by Pilkington (1929); from them estimates are obtainable of the apical angle of
the cone that best fits the region of primordial initiation. Unfortunately for the present
purpose these apices had usually been mutilated some time before sectioning, a fact that
may possibly account for a rather high variability among the estimates derived from them.
The angles measured are respectively 48, 48, 52, 56, 58, 59, 60, 63 and 78°, with a mean of
58°. Hence the equivalent phyllotaxis index of an average apex is about 3-25 — 0-75, or 2-5,
and on the apical surface the phyllotaxis is almost exactly midway between the 2:3 and
3:5 orthogonal systems. The fact that the stipular contact parastichies are expressed by
appreciably lower Fibonacci numbers, i.e. (1-4-2), indicates the considerable tangential
elongation of the primordia in this species.

The result throws an interesting sidelight on certain diagrammatic representations of the
primordial arrangement on tht apical surface, reconstructed from careful observation of
the primordial sizes and contacts (Snow & Snow 1931, figures 9, 12, 13; and 1933, figures 4,
10, 17). In these diagrams the apical surface is represented in a cylindrical transformation.
In the 1931 reconstructions the resulting intersection angle of the 2- and 3-parastichies,
measured on the diagrams, is 105°, and that of the 3- and 5-parastichies 61°; as the assumed
divergence angle is 136°, it may be deduced from the present figure 3 that the equivalent
phyllotaxis index represented by these diagrams is 2-36. Certain modifications were made
in the 1933 reconstructions, and the angles of intersection of the same two parastichy pairs
