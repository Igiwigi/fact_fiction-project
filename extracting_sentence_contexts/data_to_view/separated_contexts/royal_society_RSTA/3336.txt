Multiple alignment of the reconstructed ancestor sequence with the sequences
from all of the known extant species shows that the sequence of the large domain (located
on the N-terminus side) can be confidently established (figure 4). This fragment ranges from
residues 40 to 240, which covers the functionally important zinc-binding core [82,83]. On the other
hand, the other parts of the reconstructed protein sequence are less reliable, as evidenced by the
fact that the second- and third-most probable amino acid are closer to the most probable one
(figure 4).

5. Signatures of primitiveness: extending lessons learned from phylogenetic
reconstruction to more general principles of molecular evolution

From joint phylogenetic/geochronological reconstructions such as our reconstruction of Rubisco
[56] and carbonic anhydrase, we may attempt to identify more general principles of molecular
evolution, either by finding signatures of primitiveness—characters in which the first invaders of a
new niche or new functionality still reflect what they were before, and are not yet well adapted
to their new mode of life—or by studying the dynamic by which forces of selection become
displaced from one molecular system to another—when some primitive, inherited molecular function
is incapable of responding to selective criteria from the new environment that have become
irresistible. Relevant signatures of primitiveness can vary across protein families and ancestral functions.
