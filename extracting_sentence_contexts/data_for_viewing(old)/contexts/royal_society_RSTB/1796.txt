divergences of the male and female curve.*

This average-line forms with the abscisse, and with the last ordinate, a right-angled triangle. If the

advancing of the ages of the two consorts were the same (case of strict parallelism), the horizontal and
the vertical cathetus would be of equal length, and thus the hypotenuse wonld be inclined at 45°. The
© shorter the vertical cathetus, the narrower the angle—that is, the smaller that age-stratum out of which
2 the determinated sex may select his consort in order to obtain the greatest relative natality. Now we find
that this angle is for the female curve of 143°, for the male of 24}°, that is, the male shows a selecting
latitude which is, in the average, } time greater than that of the females.t Thus, it is possible to
& characterize the general average course of these complex relations by the simple indication of the
degrees of an angle. By this selecting latitude we ought not to understand the known social fact,
‘Oo that in the actual state of society, the right of choice is, in fact, on the side of the male, but that latitude
% which is required by nature, the limits of ages between which, according to the physiological dis-
> position of the human constitution, each of the two sexes may make its choice in order to obtain the
= greatest fecundity.
% With different nations this physiological angle may be different, as, for instance, the angle of
P| Camper, or any other anthropometrical measurement. If such observations are established also for other
€ populations, it will present a special interest to enquire what is the order of each nation, if ranged
© according to the wideness of its angle.
