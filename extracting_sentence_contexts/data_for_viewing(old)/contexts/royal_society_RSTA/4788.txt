contradicting the assumption that guy isa homomorphism. Hence .%, cannot be embedded as a

This result demonstrates the power of the functorial viewpoint; recall that the individual
algebras 4 (M, J) and ,(M, J) are isomorphic for all 4,4 € R. Thus, the distinction between the
theories lies in the fact that there is no way of choosing such isomorphisms in a natural way. In
this sense, the physics represented by a theory is encoded in its functorial structure.

4. Local physical content and dynamical locality

We turn to the description of the local physical content of a theory .&/ : Loc — Phys, in a causally
convex region O of space-time M (there seems to be no obstruction to generalizing the
background category if desired). Two ignorance principles apply: ignorance of whether the space—
time extends at all beyond O, and ignorance of what the metric might be outside O. According
to the ignorance meta-principle, the local content associated with O ought to be independent of
each factor, and suggests two characterizations.

First, we may consider the local physical content to be the full content we would have
