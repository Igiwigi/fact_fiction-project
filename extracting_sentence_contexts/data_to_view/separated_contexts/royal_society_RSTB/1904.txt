The existence ot

the ventral nucleus of the optic thalamus. (Further facts on the sensory path in the pons are given in Series D, p. 32.) SERIES D.
Tue Curanzous SENSORY AND OTHER CoRTICIPETAL SYSTEMS. For the investigation of this subject the sensory path was divided as high up in
the hind brain as was possible and compatible with survival, the operation being
naturally a severe one.
