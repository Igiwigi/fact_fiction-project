However, if roughness increases on the surface of a hydrophilic
material, the surface will become more hydrophilic due to surface wetting characteristics being
modified that lower the contact angle of the surface [29]. It is clear from the SEM images that the
central curved spines of F. wislizenii have the greatest number of surface microfeatures, closely
followed by the straight radial spines of F. wislizenii; these would effectively cause these spines to
have high surface roughness parameters, which would increase their hydrophobicity. The fact that C. cinerea survives in the driest place on the Earth, with no rainfall at times for
years, would indicate that it uses other forms of moisture to survive. Both dew droplets and fog
are present in the Atacama Desert and as such would act as a constant source of water for these
