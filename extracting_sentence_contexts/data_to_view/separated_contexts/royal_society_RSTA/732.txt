Interestingly,
it can be observed that the time series of the gradient of the velocity magnitude (approximately
equal to the vorticity magnitude) estimated from the two outermost probes (figure 10b) shows
qualitative similarity with the velocity magnitude from the innermost probe and blade inflow
a and wp. Conversely, the gradient estimated from the two innermost probes shows relatively
non-coherent time variation. This is possibly due to the fact that the near-blade vorticity has
a significant contribution from the blade shear-layer-generated small-scale fluctuations, which
do not have the apparent longer-time-scale coherence observed in the velocity magnitude
signal. The spectrum of the TE rake velocity magnitude signal at various distances from the
blade elucidates the influence of the interaction of ABL turbulence with blade boundary layer
turbulence (figure 11) on the near-blade flow. The inboard TE rake velocity magnitude spectra
(from probes 10, 31 and 52mm from the blade surface) are compared to the corresponding LE
probe wp spectrum, and a qualitative difference between these spectra is observed in the high-
frequency region (beyond approximately 1Hz).
