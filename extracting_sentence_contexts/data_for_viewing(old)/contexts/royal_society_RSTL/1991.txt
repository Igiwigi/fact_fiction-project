the ſmoke of a candle, and that of the other thermome-
ter B was left clean, on being expoſed to the Sun they
ſhewed different degrees of temperature; the quickſilyer
in the tube of a was much above the quickfilver in the
tube of B, This difference ſometimes amounted to about
£0?, but it was never conſtant, varying according to the
clearneſs of the Sun's light as well as of the air, and alſo
according to the different degrees of temperature of the
atmoſphere,

Keeping the frame with thoſe thermometers, one of
which had the ball painted black, hung on the fide of
a window, I obſerved a remarkable fact, vis. that theſe
thermometers ſhewed unequal degrees of heat, not only
when preſented to the Sun, but alſo when expoſed to the
ſtrong day-light, 1 cleaned the bulb of the thermome-
ter 4, and blackened that of s, but the effect was con-
Rant, vis, the quickſilver in the tube of the thermometer,
