The first column are Dovyer-London currents; the second, Dover-Tonbridge. Being
read off on the same instrument, and under circumstances 80 favourable, they are strictly
comparable. 'There are no relative values to be traced. For instance, 13* corresponds
with 387; 18? with 21* and 25*; 15” is coupled with various values—15®, 16, 20*, 30*,
and 35?, and 80 on. These illustrations may be extended at pleasure.

Since my original communication to the Royal Society, an * eighth article,” by Pro-
fessor Loomis, has appeared in the © American Journal,” vol, xxxii., November 1861. On
discussing the results accumulated in America, he infers that all the facts are consistent
with the supposition of electric currents moving to and fro on the earth's snrface, the
average direction of which, on that continent, is from about N. 45* E. to S. 45* W., a
result remarkably in accordance with the conclusions to which we have arrived by a
somewhat different process for the S.F. part of England. He has also discussed, in quite
another way, the magnetic disturbances in Europe ; and he obtains a direction for the
electric wave, connected with those disturbances, from N. 28* E. to S. 28* W. over the
surface of Europe. These approximations are noteworthy.

It is plain, howeyer, from Tables XTIT. and XV., that currents from time to time
flow from some point in the S.E. and in the N.W. quadrants. These directions may for
the present be called abnormal. Tn the existing state of our knowledge, it is impossible
to say whether they indicate the state of transition between the two normal quadrants,
