Even the strongly exothermic change at E’ does not show
itself by any pattern in the pure Sn 25, for the obvious reason that both before and
after the change there are no two substances for the etching reagent to distinguish
between. In quite the lowest chills, and in the unchilled ingots, the patches
sometimes assume a bar-like form, especially if the polished and etched surface is
exposed to the air for some days before examination. This appears to be due to the
fact that the plates of 7, of which the ingot is composed when the temperature is
below E’, oxidise at different rates according to their position with reference to the
plane of the section. This effect is seen in fig. 66, an unchilled ingot.
