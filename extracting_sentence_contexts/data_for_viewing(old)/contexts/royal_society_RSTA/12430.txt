to the bench. ;

The weight, P, carries a light arm, on the end of which is a style for the purpose of
writing on the smoked paper upon the recording-cylinder, T, which is driven by clock-
work in the usual manner. Thus the position of the rider throughout each experiment
is recorded on a diminished scale.

The Standard of Electromotive Force.

The standard of E.M.F. to which all the measurements were ultimately referred
was a Clark’s cell, made up according to the directions given by Lord Rayurtau.*
The form adopted was a U-shape, the limb containing the mercury being of a greater
diameter than that of the limb containing the zine pole; in fact, the cell was made
of a disused pipette, one end of which was cut off and the delivery tube bent round.
It was supported by passing the limbs through a cork fitted with a wide-mouthed
bottle, and this was filled with water’in which a thermometer was immersed. It
was thought that the temperature of the cell could thus be more easily ascertained
and would be less liable to variation.

Before and after each experiment the Daniell’s cells were balanced against the
Clark's cell and the position of the rider noted. It has been shown by one of us
that, with a capillary electrometer arranged in this way, the quantity of electricity
allowed to pass in the process of balancing need never be more than sufficient to
charge ‘25 microfarad to °005 volt.
