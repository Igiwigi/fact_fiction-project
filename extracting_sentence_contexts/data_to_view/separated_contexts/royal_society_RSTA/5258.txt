& The experiments J 20 to 34, are in better agreement amongst themselves than the
@arlier ones, and the cause no doubt is that just indicated.
] The mean result of the earlier experiments is satisfactory as likewise the mean
time of each experiment, but the times over small ranges (especially in experiments
Qos. J 5 to 12) leave much to be desired. The fact that the quantity of heat
leveloped by the stirrer was increased by the removal of the gutta-percha frag-
‘nents is a proof that the flow of water was appreciably diminished by the

bstruction. | a ction. a Section XIJ.—Tuer Gatn or Loss By Rapriation, &c.

= Tt has already been pointed out that the method of observation adopted enabled us
to determine, with sufficient accuracy, the total loss or gain of heat per second at any
gtemperature, apart from the supply due to current.
