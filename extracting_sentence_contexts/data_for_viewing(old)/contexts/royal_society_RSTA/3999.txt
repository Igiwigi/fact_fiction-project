data processing and interpretation expert knowledge is needed to translate the bare data acquired by a mass
spectrometer into useable results, and finallyâ€”scientifically sound conclusions


sample preparation is the one that requires special attention. Separation techniques are used to
decrease interferences caused by sample matrices, and improve quantitative capabilities of mass
spectrometric methods.

Arguably, much of the progress in MS methodology, especially regarding quantitative MS, has
been motivated by the demands from bioscience fields (e.g. biochemistry, chemical biology). For
example, the sub-field of proteomics is aiming to identify and quantify large numbers of proteins
present in extracts of cells, tissues and biofluids. Quantification can be absolute or relative. In
fact, many of the biochemical applications of MS rely on relative quantification. In these cases, it
is sufficient to report a change in the relative levels of biomolecules in the analysed samples.
However, in other cases, it is critical to provide the results in absolute units (concentration
units such as moles per litre, or amount units such as moles) [14-16]. Although the progress in
quantitative MS method development and applications has been enormous, still a lot of effort has :
to be made to render MS a fully quantitative tool. f=

Research in the MS field is multi-disciplinary. Quantitative measurements performed with MS 3
build on the achievements in various disciplines of science and engineering. A few available :
literature positions are particularly relevant to quantitative MS [17-23] (see also related papers nee)
published in the Mass Spectrometry Reviews journal). While this literature touched on various :
aspects of quantitative MS, many of the previous publications focused on specific topics (e.g. a]
proteomics). Arguably, publications on quantitative MS usually do not reach out to those who DN
