The initial
configurations are those derived in our previous work [29]. As in this work we are concerned
with the study of both the isomerization processes and the tendency of the clusters to dissociate;
the equilibration stage usually considered in MD is absent from our simulations. In fact, we want
to investigate the differences in the dynamic behaviour of the most stable isomers of Nat-(Bz)4
and Cs*-(Bz)4 and, hence, we needed to avoid the inconvenient interconversion among such
isomer structures that may occur during the equilibration stage of the system. This means that in
our simulations, independently of the T considered, the initial configuration of the simulations is
that of the most stable isomer. The analysis of the differences between Na*-(Bz)4 and Cst-(Bz)4
was based on the mean values of both the potential energy (configuration energy, Erg) and T.
