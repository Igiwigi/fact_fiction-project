In
the double rating condition, they saw the first image for 5s and then had no limit on the amount
of time they could take before providing their response. But in the single rating condition, they nee)
just saw the first image for 5s, before being presented with the second image. So a difference in
ratings might arise from the fact that people process the first image in the double rating condition a]
for longer, perhaps increasing the likelihood of more deliberative or strategic processing. Such DNS
processing possibly implies that the image would leave a stronger impression and have greater area
saliency or become more accessible, as a point of reference, when considering the second image. a
The rating of the second image in our experiments may be affected by a process of affective .
priming of the first image. Affective priming is the finding that processing of an affective stimulus
can be faster and more accurate when preceded by a stimulus of the same valence as opposed
to an oppositely valenced prior stimulus.
