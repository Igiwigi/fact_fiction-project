tata which had crescentic teeth, with five well-developed lobes on their upper molars.
The family might be termed Anthracotheride, as the Anthracotheria are among the
most prominent representatives of this group ; but the Hyopotamide being richer in
subgeneric forms, the family may perhaps better bear their name.

The chief character on which the genus Hyopotamus (under the different names of
Ancodus, Cyclognathus, Bothriodon) was founded is the shape of the upper molars, of
greater breadth than length, and having five well-developed crescents or lobes. No
author has mentioned any bones belonging to different sets of teeth, on the real or
suppoxed differences of which many species were founded. The priority of mentioning
these teeth under the name of Ancodus is claimed by PoxeL in his Â© Catalogue; * but
as he neither gave a good description of them, nor illustrated his short notices by figures,
no palzontologist has accepted this name, and it may be considered extinct. In fact,
long before PoxeL, Cuvigs, having received a Jaw of this genus from Puy, compared it
with Cheropotamus and Anthracotherium; and as he had only the back molars, he

deemed it unnecessary to separate the new animal from Anthracotherium, and designated

it under the name of Anthracotherium velaunum. In the year 1847, however, Professor
Owexs, having received from the Marchioness of HasriNGs very good materials, as far as
the dentition was concerned, studied with great accuracy the structure of these teeth,
and found in them sufficient characteristic differences to justify their separation from
