expressing @ in terms of the polynomials of Section 3, wherein Â¢ is the time in 6-day
intervals measured from the central period of the year. Figs. 4 to 8 show the course of
the function a throughout the year.

9. Discussion of Figs. 4 to 8.
It should be emphasised that the information provided by a comparison of the rain
record with the subsequent yields tells us the effect, not of so much rain, as such, but of

the total meteorological phenomena in fact associated with rain, at the time of the year
considered. Thus in our records rain is associated with lower temperatures in summer,
in winter with higher temperatures; and generally with diminished sunshine. The
effects of these, to the extent in which they are associated, will be incorporated in the total
effects shown in the charts, and are in fact an integral part of the value of a rain record
as a means of foreseeing the prospects of the crop.

Even in the case of the rainfall itself, however, a detailed consideration of the ways
in which it may affect the crop would lead to a most intricate discussion. It would
be of the greatest value to know how important to the final crop, and how frequently
influential, are not onlythe actual moisture available in the soil, but also the degree of soil
aeration; how frequently, and to what extent, root development is hindered by soil
saturation, or by an accumulation in toxic concentration of carbon dioxide. We should
