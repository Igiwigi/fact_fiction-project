wave about, the valves snapping repeatedly without the application of further
stimuli. As soon as a pedicellaria touches the object which is causing mechanical
stimulation, it snaps its valves on it and retains the foreign body within its grasp.
Neighbouring pedicellariae bend towards the cause of the disturbance and, after
touching it, seize it by closure of the jaws. The impulse to open the valves can,
apparently, be transferred to neighbouring pedicellariae, while the impulse required
to close them and to keep them closed is not so conducted. In this latter case, in
fact, in order for closure to occur, each valve must be separately stimulated. There
is then, in the “ opening ”’ reaction and its transference to neighbouring pedicellariae,
evidence of nervous connexions outside the body of the pedicellaria, while in the
“closing”? reaction, which is not transmitted from one pedicellaria to another,
there is evidence of an independent sensory-motor system within the body of the
organ. JENNINGS (1907) found, moreover, that in the absence of inhibitory impulses
stimulation of the inside of the valve caused closure, while stimulation of the outer
surface caused opening of the valves. As a result of JeNNING’s work it is established
that while many of the movements of the pedicellaria are coordinated with those
of its neighbours, each individual pedicellaria is capable of a functional autonomy ;
which autonomy, we may add, is determined by the independent sensory-motor
system of the organ. We are aided in our search for the nervous reflex arcs by the
knowledge that closing or opening are respectively conditioned by stimulation of the
