from its colouring matter being seen by means of an increased
quantity of light. One is afforded by rubbing a piece of the
darkest crassamentum with a proper quantity of serum ; for a
mixture is thus formed, in a few seconds, possessing a colour
similar to that which is given to crassamentum by common air.
But here we certainly do, nothing more, than interpose among
the red globules a numberof the less dense particles of serum:;
which, in their present situation, act as opake matter, and con-
sequently increase the internal reflections. A second example
occurs, when we view, by transmitted light, the fine edges and
angles of a piece of crassamentum in water; for, in this si-
tuation, their colour appears to be a bright scarlet, though all
the other parts of the sxame mass are black. These facts seem
sufficient to prove, that the immediate cause I have assigned
for the production of the florid appearance in blood, which has
been exposed to the action of common air and neutral salts, is
adequate to the effect; but I shall advance a step further, and
shew how the Modena red is converted into a scarlet.

Blood, as I have found by experiment, is one of those fluids
which Sir Isaac NewTox has observed appear yellow, * if
viewed in very thin masses. When, therefore, a number of
opake particles. are formed in it, by the action of common air
and the neutral salts, many of them must be situated imme-
diately beneath the surface. The light reflected by these will
