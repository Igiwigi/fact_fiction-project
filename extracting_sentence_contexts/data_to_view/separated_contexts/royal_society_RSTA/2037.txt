The reason is
the aggregation of the particles into chain-like structures under the application of a magnetic
field, which gives to the samples a gel-like microstructure. Note that, for samples based on LVSA
polymer, in the absence of an applied magnetic field, a viscoelastic liquid behaviour (G” > G’) was
obtained. Another remarkable feature of figure 8 is the fact that, as the magnetic field increases,
the magnitudes of both G’ and G” increase, as a consequence of the MR effect. Finally, we observe
the appearance of a maximum in G” under a field in the range 10-100% of strain. These maxima
represent yielding points, for which the magnetic field-induced particle structures are broken by
the applied shear.
