model (b). The red trace (lighter, in greyscale) is given by (ata) and the blue trace presents (bt b).
The SET and RESET input conditions, marked by the short intervals between dashed vertical
lines, induce transitions to their respective target latch states: ‘on’ corresponds to the a-mode
being in a high photon number state, while ‘off’ corresponds to a high photon number in mode 6.

Owing to the symmetry of the underlying circuit model, the model parameters are
invariant under exchange of the two pseudo-NAND gates, which corresponds to
simultaneously exchanging S @ R, (a, al) = (0, b'), (L1, Lo, Ls) > (La, Ls, Lg) and
S, < So. This symmetry suggests that the most likely candidates for the internal
logical states ‘on’ and ‘off’ correspond to the case where one internal cavity mode
is in a high power state and the other one in a low power state and the opposite
case, obtained by exchanging the cavity states. This is indeed the case, and in
fact it follows from the basic way in which we have designed our pseudo-NAND
gate; ‘on’ = {NAND1 cavity power is low, NAND2 cavity power is high} and
‘off? < (NAND1 cavity power is high, NAND2 cavity power is low).

To understand our model’s dynamic behaviour, we turn to numerical methods.
The simulation of this model is carried out by representing the operators as
numerical matrices in a truncated product basis of Fock states of total dimension
N? =75? = 5625.° We carried out a large number of quantum jump trajectory
simulations [23,26] with the following sequence of alternating input conditions:
0.5 time units of SET, 5 units of HOLD, 0.5 units of RESET, 5 units of
HOLD (repeated twice). Figure 5a presents a typical simulated trace where
the system is subjected to this sequence of input conditions. We generally
find that the SET and RESET input conditions successfully drive the system
