As « — 0, one branch joins with the sound line « = e!/2Q, whereas on the other
branch 2 —> &. In the limit («, 2) > (0, 2), we have ¢, > oo and the limiting state propagates to
infinity, i.e. it is not a surface wave. In fact, this limiting state is nothing but the solution already
found in §3b describing perfect absorption of a normally incident plane wave. Analysis of (4.2) in the critically coupled case Ay ~ €1/ reveals two distinguished regimes. The
first, defined by the scalings « — €¥/?2 ~5/® and @ — 2 ~e'/, corresponds to the dispersion
curve separating from the sound line as the resonance frequency is approached.
