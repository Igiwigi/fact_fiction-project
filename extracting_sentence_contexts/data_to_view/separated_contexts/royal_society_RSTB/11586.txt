Figure 3 summar-
izes how integrative simulations can be an organic part of the
research process. The same observations that researchers use
to form mental models and hypotheses are first organized
into databases such as PyOpenWorm and ChannelWorm
(arrow a). Researchers benefit from these databases directly,
for example, by having on-demand access to useful facts
about C. elegans physiology (arrows b and c). Subsequently,
these datasets are formalized into mathematical models, a
process that is itself intrinsically valuable to researchers as
part of hypothesis generation (arrow e). Most significant are
the final steps of this sequence, in which the datasets and
mathematical models are integrated into a larger, composite
simulation.
