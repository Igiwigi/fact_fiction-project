In this case there was no possibility of condensation of vapour on the lower part of
the tube, while previously, when readings were begun at the largest volume, con-
densation might have taken place on the lower part of the tube. If, therefore, the
high vapour-densities are due to adhesion and condensation, the value of this reading
at 40° should be lower than it was found in the first series. This is in fact the case,
as is shown by the following determinations :—
