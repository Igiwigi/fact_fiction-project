AGGREGATION OF EUGLENA VIRIDIS, EHRB., AND OTHER MICRO-ORGANISMS. 355

layer of Euglenze may act as a shade for those individuals that are not directly on
the surface, and may thus bring about the condition necessary for aggregation, viz.,
a reduction in the light which is allowed to act upon them, similar to the effect
produced when a sheet of green glass is interposed. In other words, so long as the
individual Euglenz are in such a position that they can be acted upon by light, no
streaming takes place. But as soon as they become so congested that a certain
number of them are obscured or placed in the shade by the others, they are no
longer attracted or held up by the light, and a downward streaming at once begins.
It appears to be, in fact, a manifestation of precisely the same phenomenon as occurs
in the process of aggregation in closed tubes and cells in the dark.

The following experiment illustrates this clearly : A small number of motile cells
in a white saucer is placed in a window. In a short time they will all be attracted
to the light side, and in the form of a distinct green layer at the edge of the water.
As the number is small, however, all of them remain exposed to the light, no shading
effect is produced, and no streaming takes place. If the saucer is now covered with
a piece of cardboard so as to exclude the hight, there will be formed, in about
30 seconds, a fringe of falling streams, This only takes place, however, if the
organisms remain motile. If the light is very strong, or if they have been exposed to
a moderate light too long, they become rounded off and form a scum which remains
closely attached to the edge of the saucer and does not sink when placed in the
