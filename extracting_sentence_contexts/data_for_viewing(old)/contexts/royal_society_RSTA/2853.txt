in figure 2b).

Large f values similarly allow analysis. Upstream influence lengths are small of order 6-1
here. The main response takes place over the patch where the shape fg is given approximately by
er hfe = —Ppo from (4.2b), since pg is of order B~®, except near the ends where there are thin zones
in which the x-variation is of order 6-1. Results for 6 = 4 in figure 4 tie in with the approximation
in terms of the fg maximum value.

Resonance is found to occur. For a representative fixed 6 of unity, the results of varying the
incident wall shear 4 are presented in figure 5. These indicate a critical value 4 = 41 (about 83.0) at
which the shape and pressure response become unbounded on linear grounds, or ‘intensification’
takes place (giving a weakly nonlinear stage followed by a strongly nonlinear one, depending
on details, see below). In fact, an infinite sequence of such critical values or eigenvalues 4 = Ay is
obtained. Such resonance is present for any 6 value.

5. Resonance leads to nonlinear evolution and transition

The resonance phenomenon has an interpretation in terms of flow transition as depicted in
figure 6. Clearly when the wall shear A(t) of the incident flow acquires certain critical values
