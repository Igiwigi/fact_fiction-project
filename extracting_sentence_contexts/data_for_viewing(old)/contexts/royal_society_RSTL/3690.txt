Ir is among the facts in chemical science which admit of no dispute, that a substance
frequently shows a greater tendency to combine with one body than with another.
This has usually received the appellation * elective attraction,” or © elective affinity.”
It is also perhaps universally allowed that the manifestations of this elective affinity
are greatly influenced by the insolubility, or the volatility of the original substances,
or of the resulting compounds. The degree of temperature, the respective masses of
the different substances, the presence of other bodies, and many circumstances beside
these, are supposed to modify the result.

The attempt has frequently been made to construct tables showing the relative
strength of affinity of different substances for some particular body, and GuyToN DE
Moxveav even endeavoured to give a numerical expression to them. In treating of
this subject the elaborate disquisition of Berman, © De Attractionibus Electivis,” must
