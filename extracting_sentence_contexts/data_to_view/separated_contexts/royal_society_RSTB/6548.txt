It has a large
antero-lateral cusp, a smaller postero-lateral one, and a rounded cusp on the medial
margin of the tooth. It is therefore of tritubercular nature at this stage. The fact that
there are two prominent cusps developing on the lateral side of the crown indicates
that this tooth is developing the same essential cusp pattern as the preceding cheek
teeth. Vascularization of the enamel organ has commenced and the vessels are directed in
towards the apical region of the antero-lateral cusp. In association with the antero-lateral cusp is a large epithelial body (fig. 90, Plate 47)
which lies just deep to the external enamel epithelium and is connected to the apex
of the cusp by a condensed strand of cells.
