If it is required to ascertain the value of a reversionary
annuity payable half yearly or quarterly, the calculation be-
comes in appearance a little paradoxical ; for since' the true
value of a reversionary annuity for the life of one person,
for example, after the death of another, is the difference be-
tween the values of two annuities on the single life and the
joint lives, and since an equal addition must be made to' these
values in consideration of the period of payment being short-
ened, it follows that the reversionary annuity must be of
equal value in either form. This conclusion would indeed
be strictly true if the periodical times of payment remained
unaltered, according to the supposition from which the value
of the annuities is deduced ; while in fact it is usual to grant
such an annuity to commence at the first-quarterly, half yearly,
or annual period after the contingent event: a variation
which would have no sensible effect in the case of daily pay-
ments, but which lessens the value of reversionary annuities
at other periods by that of half a payment for the given
period, reduced to the present time in the same manner'as
any other sum assured as payable upon the same contingency
of survivorship.

The simplicity observable'in the progression of the values
of annuities, calculated according to the values of lives here
supposed, and at's percent. interest, leads us to inquire what
