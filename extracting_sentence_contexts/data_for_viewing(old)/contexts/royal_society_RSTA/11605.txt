of water which condenses in consequence of the corresponding expansion may be
calculated, With the exceedingly dense fogs with which we are now dealing there
is no doubt that the water which condenses on the walls will be small in quantity

compared with what condenses in the form of drops. From the quantity of water
which separates, and the size of the drops, we may calculate the number, assuming
the water to be equally divided among them.

It is assumed here that the cloud-particles are actually liquid drops and not ice-
crystals, in spite of the fact that the condensation begins at temperatures much below
the freezing point, and that the temperature when the particles are full grown is, as
we shall see, also slightly below the freezing point.

Let us consider first the quantity of water which separates out in consequence of
an expansion of a given amount. Let us suppose the expansion to be completed
before the drops have grown to more than a very small fraction of their final size, so
that the theoretical lowering of temperature results. Let ¢, be the temperature
Centigrade before expansion, ¢, the lowest temperature reached.

In consequence of the condensation of the water, heat is set free, and the tempera-
ture of the moist air rises. A stationary state is reached at a temperature t;, when
just so much water has separated that the vapour remaining is in equilibrium in
