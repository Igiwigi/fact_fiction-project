W. HOFMANN'S RESEARCHES REGARDING THE

chemists, the ammonia would pre-exist in the organic bases ; these bodies would be
conjugated compounds of ammonia with various adjuncts, containing either carbon
and hydrogen, or these elements together with nitrogen, oxygen and even sulphur,
compounds in which the original character of the ammonia has only been slightly
modified by the accession of the adjunct. This view is chiefly supported by the mode
and the proportions in which these alkaloids combine with acids, and by the fact, that
various organic substances, by directly uniting with ammonia, give rise to the forma-
tion of basic compounds which are perfectly analogous to the alkaloids occurring in
the economy of nature. According to LizBic's opinion, ammonia would no longer
exist in the organic bases. At the time when LieB1G* wrote upon this subject, the
attention of chemists was much engaged with the study of a class of compounds,
known under the name of amides, the prototype of which, oxamide, was discoyered
by Dumas.
