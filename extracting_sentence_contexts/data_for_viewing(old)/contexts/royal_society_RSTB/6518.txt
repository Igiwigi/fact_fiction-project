cultures at various periods (figs. 20-22, Plate 4), all representing specimens from one
clone). It seems that chains of narrow cells which are capable of auxospore formation
mostly belong to the type of v. genuina (fig. 22, Plate 4), whereas in broad chains

the bristles may cross either near the base (fig. 21, Plate 4) or farther off (fig. 204,
Plate 4).

Resting spores have been described by Meunier (1913). In the cultures they were
mostly found in spring, lying singly within normal, not specially formed mother cells
(fig. 21, Plate 4). Apart from the fact that resting spores of Chaetoceros didymus were
also found in dense cultures only, the environmental conditions for their formation
must be somewhat different from those in Ditylum. They were never found in such
great numbers as in Ditylum—this applies also to all other diatoms which I cultured—
and were not regularly formed in successive subcultures throughout a long period.

The first auxospores were noticed on 29 October in a 25 days old culture of the line
mentioned above. These auxospores did not develop in the original culture. The
first chains of broad cells were found in a later subculture on 11 November. They
appeared in all subsequent cultures, always at a considerable interval—8-—28 days—
after the start of the culture.

The auxospores are similar to those described in other species of Chaetoceros (cf.
