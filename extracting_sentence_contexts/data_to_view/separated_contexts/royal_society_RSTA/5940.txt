To begin with, we suppose that 4 and ug are univariate, depending only on wealth w € Rt (so
that S € R*), and that they are increasing and concave functions as described above. We further
suppose that both agents are fully informed—i.e. both are aware of their own utility functions,
of the wealth increment Awa (respectively, Awg) that will result if A (respectively, B) wins, and
of the probability p (respectively, 1 — p) of that happening. If risk-averse agents’ decision-making
behaviours under risk were governed by Expected Utility Theory, they would enter a transaction
if and only if both expected to gain from it relative to doing nothing, i.e. if

Elua(w',)] >ua(wa) and Elug(w')] > ups). (3.2)
Computing the expectation values from the above description, we obtain
pua(wa + Awa) + (1 — p)ta@wa — Awp) > wa(wa)
and
pup(we — Awa) + (1 — p)up(we + Aws) > up(ws). (3.3)
Solving both inequalities for p, we find

ua(wa) — Ua(wa — Awp) up(wg + Awp) — up(wp)
ua(wa + Awa) — ua(wa — Awp) up(wp + Awp) — up(we — Awa)’

(3.4)


where we used the fact that u4 and ug are increasing functions to establish that the denominators
of the two fractions in equation (3.4) are positive. If either or both inequalities in equation (3.4)
does not hold, then one or both agents will refuse to enter into the transaction, and so the
transaction will not take place. A necessary condition for equation (3.4) to hold is that the upper bound of p be greater than its
lower bound, or

ua(wa) — Ua(wa — Awp) up(wp + Awg) — up(ws)
ua(wa + Awa) — ua(wa — Awp)  up(wp + Awp) — up(we — Awa)

(3.5)

Unfortunately, this inequality is in clear and direct contradiction to the result of the following
theorem, proven in electronic supplementary material, S(a).
