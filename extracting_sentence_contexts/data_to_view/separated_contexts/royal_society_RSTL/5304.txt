The fairest way of considering the subject without assuming the uniformity of
phase, is to take a section of the incident ray PQ parallel
to the refracting surface, and therefore ==, and upon
every particle of this section to erect ordinates representing
the phases of the different particles: the rippled surface
which passes through the extremities of these ordinates

will possess a kind of type, which after the time ZE will be

transferred to the sarface AB, through which it will be
transmitted, with diminished intensity, into the refracting

medium, and after a time = will be brought into the

position PQ, parallel to AB and PQ. Presented under this point of view, the question affords no hold whatever for the

determination of 9, and I think I am entitled to conclude that the formula

are quite independent of such analogy, and are true whatever may be the type of the
rippled surface at the front of the waves. I may mention, by the way, that I think it arises from the existence of such a
rippled front of wave, that the fringes of interference, which border the margin of a
small aperture, upon which a conical pencil of light is incident, are found to vanish
when the aperture exceeds a very small limit ; in fact, when the aperture is enlarged
s0 as to admit a comparatively large chequered surface of the wave's front, the several
portions destroy each other's effect by interference ; but when the aperture is 80 small
as only to admit a portion which presents a uniformity of phase, then the fringes
present themselves and admit of the usual explanation. The hyporhesis of a rippled
front is therefore not only the most probable when we consider the origin of the
beam, but it accounts simultaneously for the non-spread of the wave and the disap-
pearance of the fringes when the aperture is large. It may perhaps be urged in fayour of the hypothesis of uniformity of phase in the
