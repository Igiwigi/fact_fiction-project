How far this resemblance is accidental I am unable to say, but I cannot

g believe that it is wholly so. A For a comparison of the skeleton in the two forms, so far as it can be made, I must
refer to the works of previous writers (7 and 20), but I may point out that the series
of interradial plates in Asterina developed round the right body-cavity at first forms
a horseshoe-shaped curve, open towards the preoral lobe, just like the basals of
Antedon, to which they correspond. It might have been expected that the change in the orientation of the Crinoid larva
would seriously affect the question of homologies of the plates of the Crinoidal calyx ;
but, as a matter of fact, owing to Gérrn’s somewhat fortunate mistake, this is not the
case, and P, H. Carpenter’s arguments derived from the development of the basals
and orals round the right and left body-cavities respectively remain unaltered (7).
