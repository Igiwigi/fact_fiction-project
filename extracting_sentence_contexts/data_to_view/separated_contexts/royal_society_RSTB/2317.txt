By this means we avoid the errors incident to all
methods which depend on the determination of small differences between two large
values. It is essential that the caustic soda should be absolutely free from alumina and
iron, which interfere with the sharpness of the second titration, consequently caustic
soda made from metallic sodium should be employed. If a trace of alkaline silicate is
present it interferes somewhat with the delicacy of the phenolphthalein reaction, a
fact which has also been noticed by Lerrs and Brake in the titration of baryta
solutions (‘ Proc. Royal Dublin Soe.,’ ix. (1900), p. 152).
