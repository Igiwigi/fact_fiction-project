This object is accomplished by constructing a hypothetical infinite population, of
which the actual data are regarded as constituting a random sample. The law of distri-
bution of this hypothetical population is specified by relatively few parameters, which
are sufficient to describe it exhaustively in respect of all qualities under discussion,
Any information given by the sample, which is of use in estimating the values of these
parameters, is relevant information. Since the number of independent facts supplied in

the data is usually far greater than the number of facts sought, much of the information
supplied by any actual sample is irrelevant. It is the object of the statistical processes
employed in the reduction of data to exclude this irrelevant information, and to isolate
the whole of the relevant information contained in the data.

When we speak of the probability of a certain object fulfilling a certain condition, we
imagine all such objects to be divided into two classes, according as they do or do not
fulfil the condition. This is the only characteristic in them of which we take cognisance.
For this reason probability is the most elementary of statistical concepts. It is a para-
meter which specifies a simple dichotomy in an infinite hypothetical population, and it
represents neither more nor less than the frequency ratio which we imagine such a
population to exhibit. For example, when we say that the probability of throwing a
five with a die is one-sixth, we must not be taken to mean that of any six throws with
