Geological Survey and noting how, between two lengths where it runs on Keuper marl,
it crosses the thick filling of glacial drift which marks the old pre-glacial channel at Market
Bosworth.

It would be possible to extend this analysis of drainage changes to a finer scale, to
include such facts as the changes of direction made by the Itchen, Finham Brook and other
streams. The purpose of this paper is, however, only to describe the detailed geology of one
special area and to use the conclusions which arise from it to throw a general light on the
Midlands. It would be out of place to pursue that wide inquiry to the stage of detail.

I am indebted to so many people for assistance, that to mention them all by name is
impossible, and a short list must suffice. From Professor L. J. Wills, Dr M. E. Tomlinson
and Mr D. L, F. Gilbert I have had a wealth of facts and much stimulating criticism.
Dr A. Tindell Hopwood and Dr K. S. Sandford have given their time and experience in
the examination of vertebrate remains, and under the general heading of the Geological
Survey I can tender my thanks to the numerous officers who have assisted me in my
examination of published and unpublished maps and borehole records. Mr W. Yardley,
of the Wolston Sand and Gravel Company, and Messrs Baillie, Brind and Company have
given me unrestricted access to all trial hole information. From the hundreds of farmers
and landowners whose ground I have traversed, I have never had anything but cordiality
and co-operation. Finally, in the arduous work of augering I have had a number of willing
assistants, of whom I would specially like to mention the late Mr J. H. Edwards and Mr P.
Hemsley.
