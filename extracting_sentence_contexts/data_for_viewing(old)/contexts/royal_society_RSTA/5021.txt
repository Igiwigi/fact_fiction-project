In what follows we refer to these points dealing with the problem of turbulent reconnection.

3. Turbulent reconnection model

The model of turbulent reconnection in LV99 generalizes the classical Sweet—Parker
model [97,98].4 In the latter model, two regions with uniform laminar magnetic fields are
separated by a thin current sheet. The speed of reconnection is given roughly by the resistivity
divided by the sheet thickness, i.e.

in incompressible fluids. In the MHD simulations that are indicative of —3 spectrum, similar to the aforementioned low-
resolution hydrodynamic simulations showing — §, no bottleneck effect is seen. As the bottleneck is a physical effect, the fact
that it is not seen in simulations to our mind means that it is just extended and higher resolution simulations are necessary.
Therefore, choosing between theories on the basis of just spectral slope of low-resolution simulations may be tricky.

“The basic idea of the model was first discussed by Sweet and the corresponding paper by Parker refers to the model as
“Sweet model’.
