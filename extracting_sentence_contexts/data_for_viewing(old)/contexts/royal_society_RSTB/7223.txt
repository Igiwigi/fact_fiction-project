S The average value of g (over the range used here) is 0-4407, which is of the same order as
3 values of g actually observed in the case of crop surveys. It is scarcely necessary to point out
3 that the graduating equation adopted here is not an exact specification of the variance
function for the point-charge field. The same thing may also be true of observational fields
© —in fact, the particular graduating formula used here has a purely empirical basis and its
validity rests entirely on pragmatic grounds.

AppENDIX 4. EXAMPLES OF CORRELATION FUNCTION
(1) Linear point-charge field. Consider m cells arranged in a straight line on either side of
unit charge, then the value of the variate (here the potential) is given by z(2’) = ral where

|7’| denotes the absolute value of i’, and i’ =m, m+1,.... —1, +1, +2, .... +m. The
