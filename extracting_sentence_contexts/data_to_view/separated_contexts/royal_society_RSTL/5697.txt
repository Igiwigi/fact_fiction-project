The buffy coat in inflammatory blood was first explained by Mr. WrarTox JoxnsÂ®,
who showed that it resulted from the red corpuscles aggregating more closely than usual,
and therefore falling more rapidly through the lighter plasma, s0 as to leave the upper
portions completely before the occurrence of coagulation. It was supposed by the ame
authority that this peculiarity of the red discs was due to increased fibrine in 0lution,
rendering the liquor sanguinis abnormally viscid, and 80 operating like the admixture
of gum above alluded to. But the fact that the corpuscles aggregate as closely after
the fibrine has been removed as before, appears quite opposed to such a view. I haye
examined many drops of my own blood, before and after the removal of its fibrine, with
the special object of ascertaining this point, and have never been able to detect any
material difference between the aggregation in the two ets of cases. In the blood of the
bat before mentioned, which was probably suffering constitutionally from inflammation,
the corpuscles continued to retain their excessive adhesiveness for a whole hour after
coagulation of the fibrine.
