Figure 9. The laser light hitting the central mirror (test mass) from the left transfers momentum to it. When the light propagates
further and then hits the mirror from the opposite side, a momentum kick of equal magnitude but with opposite sign is a
transferred to the mirror, cancelling the back-action momentum and thereby effectively reducing the position change by a [=
factor of delay time over gravitational wave period. Image courtesy of S. Danilishin. :8

inherently less susceptible to quantum noise in the first place. One of these ideas is elucidated : we
here: the speed meter [23]. [om
In a Michelson interferometer the standard quantum limit stems from the fact that a
measurements of the position x for different times do not commute: [x(t),x(t’)] 40. However, :S
in systems with momentum conservation one can, in principle, measure the momentum p of an id
ensemble of mirrors continuously with arbitrary precision because the momenta commute for
different times: [p(t), p(t’)] = 0 [24]—for a free particle the velocity x is a quantum non-demolition
(QND) variable! In a speed meter interferometer the velocity of the test mass is measured instead
of its position, hence a speed meter is a QND interferometer [23].
Figure 9 shows intuitively how a speed meter works: the impinging laser light transfers a
momentum ‘kick’ to the test mass, travels further along the path and then delivers an ‘anti-
kick’ (with opposite sign), effectively reducing the back-action created by quantum radiation
pressure noise! The total acquired phase ¢ depends on the position difference for the two
measurements. After both position measurements the net momentum transfer is zero as the
phase change is linear in x and does not depend on the position. This holds for delays much
