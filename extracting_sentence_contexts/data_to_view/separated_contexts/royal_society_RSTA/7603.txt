is exactly 4-9 cm., distance on which the calculation of the forces F, and F,’ was
based, we have by substitution in (17)

Subtracting (18) from this, we get

This equation can be used to find £,, since F, and F,’ are obtained by calculation.
£y by experiment, and @F/@z either by calculation or by experiment. Putting £ equal to £, in 15 and 16, and adding, we obtain

F,+ F/ = Fy + Fu si (Gee"ys) az”
and substituting for &, from (20),
Fy + Fu == Beets — (Ep— bu + apes) ie ogee eeRes (21)

The differential coefficients of F can be calculated, but they can also be deter-
mined experimentally without difficulty. In fact, the measurements necessary to
determine &y also yield @F/@z?, and the measurements by which £p is determined
also yield @F/6z. In practice, with coils so nearly alike as those of the current balance, ~p is so
nearly equal to &, and F, so nearly equal to F,’, that the difference between
Fy + Fy’ and F, + FY is hardly detectable. The possibility of determining it
experimentally is nevertheless interesting.
