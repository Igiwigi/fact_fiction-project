The question then becomes ‘How many is too many?’
In statistical models, new variables should only be added if
they increase the fit of the models, best measured using infor-
mation theoretic criteria [42]. In biological or process-based
models, simply choosing the ‘obvious’ variables such as
temperature and rainfall runs the danger of omitting less
obvious variables which may be equally important in deter-
mining species’ distributions; for such models the obvious
question might be ‘How few is too few?’. Parsimony, which is intrinsically good for the reasons out-
lined in the NRC quote, is in fact forced upon the present work
using statistical models because of the rather limited number
of climate variables available from GCMs. The variables avail-
able, however, may not be the right ones for the disease in
question. In addition, as the present analysis has shown,
some of the available GCM variables are very highly correl-
ated with each other, reducing the number of useful
variables still further.
