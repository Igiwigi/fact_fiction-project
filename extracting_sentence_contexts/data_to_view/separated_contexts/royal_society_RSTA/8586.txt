There are many paramagnetic substances which possess molecular magnetic
moments comparable with, and in some cases much superior to, those shown by ferro-
magnetic substances. The apparent feeble susceptibility they possess is due to the
fact that, with the largest magnetic field which can be applied, we can never produce
anything like a saturation effect. In fact, according to Wess, the molecule of cobalt
chloride, Co,Cl, contains 25 magnetons, while an atom of cobalt below the critical
temperature contains 9 magnetons. We may well ask ourselves—what is the nature
of the process by which the addition of a diamagnetic substance, H.Cl to cobalt,
produces such a large increase in the number of magnetons per molecule.{ Assuming
the work of Wetss holds good, and there is certainly a very considerable amount of
evidence in favour of his theory, we can interpret this result either by supposing that
the atom of cobalt really contains more than 9 magnetons,§ or else that the
diamagnetic acid supplies the additional magnetons when it acts on the cobalt to form
the chloride. In either case, it seems that we must admit that a molecule may
possess systems of magnetons which, in certain circumstances, are so arranged to
counterbalance one another, producing no additional moment of the molecule.|| These
magnetons would contribute nothing to the paramagnetic or ferro-magnetie property
of a substance and could not be included in Werss’s theory.
