+ When this subject first occupied my attention many years ago, I was at a loss
to form any notion of the modus operandi of these minute admixtures of foreign bodies,
except the mechanical one mentioned in-the text, yiz. that they operated by being
interposed, as it were, among the essential elements of bodies, and thus by weaken-
ing or modifying their natural affinities, But the admirable Paper, published by
Mr. HzrsCuEL, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1824, © On certain motions
produced in fluid conductors when transmitting the electric current,” appeared to
throw an entire new light on the subject. The facts brought forward in this Paper
are of the most important kind, and seem to me to be evidently connected with a
principle of a more general character, which when completely developed, will lead to
the most unexpected reults.-** That such minute proportions of extraneous matter,”
says Mr. H. © should be found capable of communicating sensible mechanical
motions and properties of a definite character to the body they are mixed with, is
perhaps one of the most extraordinary facts that has yet appeared in chemistry,
When we see energies 50 intense exerted by the ordinary forms of matter, we may
reasonably ask what evidence we have for the imponderability of any of the powerful
agents to which 50 large a part of the activity of material bodies seem to belong ?”

Any $ubstance may be supposed capable of performing the part of a meror-
ganizing body; but, in a certain point of view, water appears to constitute.the
irst and chief, at least in organized $ubstances.
