The sign of the field-change
due to a simple discharge to earth is the same at all distances, while a cloud discharge
exhibits the phenomenon of a reversal distance. It is thus quite possible that the same
complicated system of discharges would be recorded by a nearby observer as a complex
field-change and by a distant observer as a simple field-change or vice versa. In this
fact is probably to be found the explanation of a rather curious feature in the observa-
tions, namely, that the proportion of field-changes showing complexity is considerably
higher for the very close discharges and very large field-changes than for the others. In order to eliminate instrumental effects in this comparison, field-changes were only
included if the displacement on the original record was at least a millimetre and were
classified as complex if they included components of both signs, the smaller being at
least 10Â°, of the larger. Defined in this way, about one-quarter of all field-changes
recorded are complex, and the proportion is practically independent of the magnitude
of the field-change over the range from 100 to 10,000 V/m.
