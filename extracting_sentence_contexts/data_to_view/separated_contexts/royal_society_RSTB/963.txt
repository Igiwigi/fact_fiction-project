But I fail to see why the presence of ‘respiratory centres” shot
. been assumed from these experiments, if the term “ respiratory centre” be:

the floor of the 4th ventricle. In fact, excitation experiments of this
results which are equally well or even better attributed to the results of stil
fibres than of stimulating central mechanisms. Kwott,t experimenting more tecently, does not say anything about the
aneesthetic. He found that excitation of the optic thalamus and corpora quad
caused quickening of the respiration.
