This takes place while the vertebral components are
still membranous, so that the fusion is relatively earlier in Mus than in the ox, where the
“occipital vertebra” is separate and distinct from the “scheinbar ungegliederte
Abschnitt ” until chondrification takes place. Throughout the whole occipital region, the perichordal tissue is loose. This obtains
in all probability because of the fact that the notochord is widely removed from the
hind-brain, especially in the posterior part of the region, as a result of the action of the
cervical flexure. When chondrification ensues, the whole of axial tissue becomes
converted into a rod of cartilage. The notochord lies in a longitudinal groove on the
dorsal aspect of the rod.
