appears to me to be the correct one is that, in the cases in which they were shown,
the two ends of the facial nerves had reunited, at least to a certain extent. This was
indicated by the fact that there was contracture present in some, that there was
muscular tonus present in some, as shown by the increase in flaccidity on the nerve
being divided, and that at the operation the application of an electric stimulus to
the peripheral end of the facial produced contractions in the muscles. Care must therefore be taken that the surgical intervention does not take place too
early, while there is still a chance of reunion occurring, and that it does not take place
while the process of spontaneous recovery is actually in progress, as otherwise many
cases might be operated upon unnecessarily, and with a result inferior to that which
might have been attained by the spontaneous recovery. ‘The time through which
one ought to wait has been variously answered.
