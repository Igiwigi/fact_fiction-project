dZ dZ Now two solutions of the equation

are (Hartree 1935) exactly, not only asymptotically, a polynomial of degree n in z (in fact
the Hermite polynomial of order n and argument iz) and the n-fold integral of the error
function, with integration constants chosen so that this integral is zero at infinity, which is
of order e~7*/Z"*" for large Z. Since h,—+ is zero at infinity, it follows that if it is satisfied
(10-13) exactly, it would have this behaviour at infinity, but since terms of order ne”
have been omitted in equation (10-13) it follows that h, is of the same order. This argument can be extended. It can be shown similarly that h/, and 7’ are at most of
order y?e~°"", where p is finite, whereas f, is at most of order 7; hence the only terms in
equations (8-25) remaining finite are those with ¢, as a factor, and these, on re-arranging,
become (starting with (8-25 ii))

$o(2Xo1—1) = 0,
2o(2xohe +X M1) +91 (2xol, —1) = 9,
2o(BXo ls + 2xy hy t+ Xohy) +29, (xy hy + Xo he) +$2(2Xoh, —1) = 0,
etc., so that in succession we have the asymptotic relations
