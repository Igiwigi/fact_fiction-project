The evidence bearing on this question which we have so far obtained may be b ief
summarised as follows.

The presence in the plasma of foreign bodies in solution, such as egg albumen
anthrax albumose, leads to an increase in size, number, and granulation of the ro
staining cells. This is true both of th√© Frog and of Astacus. Also, as has alread
been stated, if Daphnia is exposed to toxic substances, an increased formation of
rose-reacting (amphophile, in this case) substance results.

The alteration in the chemical composition of the plasma of a hanging drop
lymph due to clotting also leads to a similar result. Lastly, we may cite
absence, often noted by us, of rose-reacting cells in lymph in which the bacilli hay
grown, and this in spite of the fact that these cells are very resistent to the toxi
substances. The presence pointed out by SHERRINGTON of similar cells in larg
numbers round the intestinal blood-vessels in cases of enteric disease suggests
they are there to intercept the toxic substances streaming in from the lumen of th
intestines. The increase in the number of these cells in inflammation, in carcinom!
&e., and, generally speaking, in cases normal or pathological, in which there is a
abnormal production of normal or abnormal products of metabolism .was noticed bs
Korysutt, Daskrewrcz, and EuRLIcH.*

The importance attached to the removal of the bacterial poisons, and th
endeavour made by the body to get vid of them, are strikingly shown by Daphnu
and Astacus.
