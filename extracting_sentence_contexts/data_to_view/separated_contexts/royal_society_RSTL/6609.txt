The last two columns of this Table, which exhibit respectively the actual amount of
Nitrogen not recoverable by the. soda-lime process in the substance after decompoxition,
and the percentage proportion of this loss upon the Nitrogen submitted to experiment,
are the most important to consider for our present purpose. With one exception (the gain of Nitrogen in which is quite within the range of the
error of analysis), all the experiments point to the fact, that a part of the Nitrogen of
decomposing organic matter passes into a state in which it cannot be estimated by the
s0da-lime process. Neither did it exist as nitric acid. There appears, therefore, to be
an evolution of free Nitrogen.
