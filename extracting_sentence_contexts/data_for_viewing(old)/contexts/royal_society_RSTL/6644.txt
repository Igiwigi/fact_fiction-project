8uppoxsed to be sufficient to superinduce a longitudinal structure. In this case, however,
the angle Â« at any point P would not increase regularly, and the curves in the part of
the glacier now referred to might present some degree of inflexion.

According to Dr. Tyxpair, the longitudinal character of the veined structure is
strongly developed, as a general rule, under all considerable central moraines; and as
such moraines always originate in the confluence of two glaciers, and present conditions
similar to those of the Aar, the explanation in all such cases will be precisely similar to
that above given, assuming the structure to be due to the instantaneous action of the
forces acting on the mass, and not to transmission.

52. In the glacier of Talefre the ice-stream is divided by the Jardin into two separate
currents, as roughly represented in fig. 12, which thus form, in fact, two separate tribu-

taries to the united glacier which proceeds, below the Jardin, to precipitate itself over
the ice-fall of Talefre. Principal Forpys appears to have examined the veined structure
carefully, and describes it as represented in the figure by the fine lines converging to the
