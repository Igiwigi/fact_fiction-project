oblique directions can be calculated. This has been done in the Report mentioned
above, and it was found that, with certain reservations considered later, the values so
calculated were in agreement with those obtained by direct experiment. Further, if
the Youne’s moduli and Potsson’s ratios are known for the principal directions, the
principal moduli of rigidity can be calculated from the results of oblique compression
tests. The values marked (B) in the above table were found by this method, and it
will be seen that in some cases they differ considerably from the values (A) obtained
directly from torsion experiments. Reasons for these discrepancies are considered
later.

Besides the complications due to anisotropy, experimental work on wood has been
rendered difficult by numerous other factors which cause variation of the mechanical
properties, and by the fact that there are irregularities of structure peculiar to every
individual specimen of wood. The elastic constants are considerably affected by the
moisture content of the wood, and, especially when the wood is moist, by the tempera-
ture. They also vary with the specific gravity of the specimen, and may also vary
(independently of the specific gravity) from the heartwood to the sapwood of the same
tree. ‘Tests on large and small specimens have in some cases given different results,}
and this has led some investigators to suggest modifications of the usual formule.}
Again, in all cases where shearing over the principal planes is involved, impact and
vibration experiments give higher values of the constants than statical experiments,
and the latter often show important “ time-effects,’’§ 7.c., the deformation increases
with the time the load has been applied. Other causes of systematic variation in the
elastic properties have been suspected, such as a variation of E,, with the width of the
annual rings (other things being equal), though in this particular case no relation could
