(f) Summary and future directions

Malleable face cues including facial adiposity, skin colour and
texture may offer more current and relevant information
with regard to health than relatively stable aspects of facial
appearance such as masculinity and symmetry. Indeed, there
is some evidence that skin information allows more accurate
perceptions of health relative to shape information [43]. Links
between actual health and specific skin condition cues
(colour and texture) as measured from facial images is cur-
rently lacking, although a wealth of evidence attests to the
fact that these cues are used in health judgements. Expression
or mood-related information was also identified as a poten-
tially important cue to health. To date, studies of facial cues
and health outcomes have focused on stable structural aspects
of the face such as averageness, symmetry and sexual dimorph-
ism. Future research should therefore test the validity of health
judgements made in response to malleable facial cues such as
colour and resting demeanour.

The adiposity literature revealed the tantalizing possibility
that facial cues to fatness may predict health outcomes more
accurately than traditional measures of body fat or weight,
although to date the only evidence supporting this notion
