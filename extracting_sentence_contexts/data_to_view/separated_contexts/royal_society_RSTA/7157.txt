KERR-GRANT ON SEISMIC INVESTIGATIONS 83

13. Conrours OF THE PALAEOZOIC FLOOR

If the upper discontinuity at the western stations is the boundary between the
Oxford clay and the limestones below it, the lower discontinuity at these stations and the
corresponding discontinuity at the others is almost certainly the surface of the Palaeo-
zoic. This identification is supported by the Culford, Great Oxendon and Bletchley*
bores, and by the fact that the refracted wave can be observed to the end of the lines,
indicating that it is not produced by a thin layer. The stations are sufficiently closely
spaced for it to be unlikely that the floor has been lost by a wrong correlation between
stations. The contours of the floor derived from the seismic work and from the bore-
holes are shown in figure 14.
