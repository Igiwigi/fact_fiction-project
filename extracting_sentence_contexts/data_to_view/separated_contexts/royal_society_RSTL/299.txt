DaLTon that we are indebted for the first correct obser-
vation of such an instance of a simple multiple in'the union of
nitrous gas with oxygen. In his endeavours to determine'the
composition of the atmosphere, he found that the quantity of
oxygen contained in 100 measures of common air would com-
bine with either g6 or 72 measures of nitrous gas, according
to certain variations in the 'mode of conducting the experi-
ment.*

Chemists in general, however, appear to have been by no
means duly impressed with the importance of this observation
of Mr. DaLTox, till they were in possession of other facts
observed by Dr. Tnomsox and myself,F in a more tangible
form, with regard to neutral and superacid or subacid salts,
which could be made the subjects of more deliberate and less
equivocal experiments; and it is, perhaps, owing to'the repe-
tition and confirmation of them by M. BerTnoLLET, | that they
have attracted the attention of other chemists, who are now
ready to admit that the term binacid correctly expresses the
relation of many superacid salts to neutrals consisting of the
same ingredients.
