cture. The pithless specimens, however, really ditler conspicuously from the
dinary type of Astromyelon. Now that we know that Astromyelon, in its typical
edullate form, is nothing but the root of Calamites, it becomes desirable to recon-
ider the evidence for the identification with it, of the minute pithless specimens. We
eve we are able to prove that here also the identification is correct, and that the
smallest specimens, without medulla, are, in fact, the finer branches, or rootlets, which
ere borne on the larger medullate organs. We shall, therefore, employ the word
‘rootlet” throughout the description, though, as we shall find, there is no sharp
listinction between these finer branches and the larger medullate specimens which we
erm simply ‘‘ roots.”

The structure of the rootlets will first be described, after which we will discuss the
evidence as to their nature.*

In some of them the middle of the central cylinder is entirely occupied by the
primary xylem, and there is no pith whatever. Neither does there seem to be
arenchyma of any kind among the primary trachee (see figs. 5, 7, and 8; also
fig. 1 in “ Organization,” Part XII.). In other cases, a very few elements, with some-
