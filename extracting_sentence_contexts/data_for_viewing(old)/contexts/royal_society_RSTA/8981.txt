The mean limit is 35012°37. The set form an additional test that the extrapolated
lines 16013 really exist. It is curious to note that the even orders of F only show
directly observed lines, whilst the odd show displaced limit lines. The F lines are far
to the violet end and come into the observed region only when weakened by high
order, The F lines are all linked to lines of higher frequency by the 1864 link, also for
m = 4, 6 to lines of lower frequency. The same tendency is shown in F to lower
frequency, any such to higher frequency lead to unobserved regions. This fact is
important as showing that at least here the 1864 separation enters in the link
relation, and not as a direct displacement on the limit.

To the F,(%) limit corresponds a 1864 triplet series parallel to that originally
considered. I have been able to follow it up in the same way as the foregoing as far
as m = 26 at least. It accentuates the evidence for the displaced sets but as that is
sufficiently supported by the results already discussed it would seem unnecessary to
overburden the present communication with additional detail. Whenever the actual
relations of the various displaced lines to one another are the subject of discussion
these details will be of the first importance. A knowledge of these relations should
be expected to throw a flood of light on the constitution pf spectra, but this new
question cannot be taken up here. It may be noted, however, that the first F and F
