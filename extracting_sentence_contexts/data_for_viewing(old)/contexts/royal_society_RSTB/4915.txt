adductor muscle by the dorso-ventral muscles of the maxillule.

The fact that in the so-called nauplius the adductor muscle belongs to the mandibular
segment does not necessarily indicate that the shell-fold must also be derived from that
seyment. It is equally probable that the precocious appearance of the shell is a larval
adaptation, and that, in growing forward over the naupliar limbs, the shell-fold has
utilised portions of the muscles, already differentiated in those segments, to serve as
adductor muscles. It will be recalled that in Daphnids and Estheria the shell-folds grow
backwards first of all, while in the Ostracod nauplius the greater part of the shell is in
front of the mandibular segment, the adductor muscle being at its posterior end.

It is clear, then, that the segmental origin of the Crustacean carapace is still unsettled,
and hence the fact that the opening of the ~ shell gland” occurs near the base of the
antenna, but actually on the shell-fold, cannot be considered as evidence either in favour
of or against the view that the “shell gland” is really the antennal gland.

Bercorp’s next point is that the ureter (the anterior reservoir) enlarges to form a
“ bladder ”* (the middle reservoir) before opening to the exterior, and this corrresponds
closely with the ureter of the antennal gland of Mysis and Siriella, as described by
GROBBEN (1880). In Mysis there is a long coiled tube which leads from the end sac
to the exterior, and which, after many coils, enlarges to form a sac and then opens to
the exterior. But even supposing that the posterior reservoir does represent a typical
end sac, the anterior reservoir should not be termed a ureter, as it does not lead from
the end sac to the exterior. It forms a cul-de-sac leading from the middle reservoir,
as reference to text-fig. 1 (e), or Bercoup’s figure 14 (1910) will show. ‘The latter, how-
