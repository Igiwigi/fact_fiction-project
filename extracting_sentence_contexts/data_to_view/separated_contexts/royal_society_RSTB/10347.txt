Although these
findings are broadly consistent with our hypotheses, stronger
support still awaits; our hypotheses are, in effect, compu-
tational in nature, and so require functional testing on
relevant timescales.

5. Implications for treatment

Our hypothesis is that a depressed brain is relatively ‘locked
in’, and running a metabolically inefficient internal model of
the body in the world, resulting in pervasive negative affect
that is salient and difficult to modify. The fact that there are
many potential sources of pathophysiology that will ulti-
mately result in a relatively ‘locked-in’ depressed brain
(i.e. ‘degeneracy’; [179]) is probably one reason why major
depressive disorder is so difficult to treat. Nonetheless,
by suggesting that depression arises from a chronic energy
inefficiency and altered interoceptive signalling through a


well-specified computational architecture, the unified theory
of mind and brain suggests several targets of opportunity
for intervention and treatment. First, depression may be relieved by directly affecting the
descending allostatic predictions that originate in agranular
limbic cortices.
