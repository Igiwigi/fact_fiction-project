Prominent examples of such network maps chart
protein—protein interactions in cells [5], genetic associations among common
human diseases [6], the global spreading of epidemics [7] and interactions
among species in an ecosystem [8]. Building network maps is an integral part
of an emerging scientific discipline called ‘network science’ [9,10], the cross-
disciplinary study of the structure and function of complex interconnected
systems. Network science capitalizes on the fact that many complex systems
can be decomposed into sets of elements (nodes) and their mutual relations
(edges or connections). Jointly, the arrangement of these nodes and edges
defines the network’s topology. The topology summarizes how nodes and
edges link together, essentially corresponding to a map of ‘what is connected
to what’ within the system of interest.
