In NaCoOz, local P3 stacking is more favourable than O1, and both are
local minima. In LiCoOy, the situation is reversed, and P3 is actually an unstable maximum. This
confirms the established fact that Li is too small to stabilize prismatic coordination. The CoO
curve has its lowest value in O1, has a local minimum in a local 03 stacking, and has a maximum
for a local P3 stacking, with smooth transitions in between. By contrast, the curves for LiCoO, and
NaCoO are mostly smooth but both contain a sharp cusp between the O1 and O03 minima that
corresponds to an abrupt change in the intercalant position as the structure is sheared.
