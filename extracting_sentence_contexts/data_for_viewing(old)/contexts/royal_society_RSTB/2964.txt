Dreissensiide.

The lamelle of Dreissensia polymorpha are flat and homorhabdie. The inter-
lamellar junctions are septa reaching to various heights. The highest of all are
about ten filaments apart in both demibranchs. Subfilamentar tissue is less abundant
than in Anodonta, but it is present in sufficient amount to reduce the fenestree
to elliptical water-pores. Except in the lowest parts of the lamelle, the vertical
rows of water-pores are only half as numerous as the filaments, a feature already

noted by Janssens (39, p. 22). This fact is due to each alternate filament having
an interlamellar extension which spreads antero-posteriorly, and brings the internal
or interlamellar opening of the water-passage opposite the internal edges of the
intervening filaments (fig. 29, ile). It is worthy of remark that Rice (83, pp. 51-55),
in spite of the enormous differences in the gill-structure of Dreissensia and Mytilus,
objects to the dissociation of these genera.
