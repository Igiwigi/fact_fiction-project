This problem has been LB
extensively studied in pattern recognition, where complex models commonly overfit the data, :
meaning that, while accounting for the existing data, they do not perform well on new data [16]. 8
The problem is aggravated for small samples, because accurate distribution-free error estimation Dw
is usually impossible and accuracy can only be assessed with distributional assumptions, which :
are not present [17]. :3

In the simplified examples shown in figure 1, one can intuitively understand how a random :3
sample of measurements of height above sea level across a golf course is unlikely to reveal the all- :
important locations of the holes, and how curve-fitting methods will struggle to map the recursive
nature of a fractal surface. Deep theory requires deep thinking, for both discovery and validation. Writing with Leopold
Infeld, Albert Einstein explained how thinking had evolved in their book The Evolution of Physics:
The Growth of Ideas From Early Concepts to Relativity and Quanta:

In nearly every detective novel since the admirable stories of Conan Doyle there comes a
time when the investigator has collected all the facts he needs for at least some phase of his
problem. These facts often seem quite strange, incoherent, and wholly unrelated. The great
detective, however, realizes that no further investigation is needed at the moment, and that
only pure thinking will lead to a correlation of the facts collected.
