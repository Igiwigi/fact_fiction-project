During cyclic loading, it was shown that coarsening occurred very rapidly without rafting.
Instead, the small precipitates were rapidly consumed by the larger ones, which had a somewhat
irregular form. The irregular form undoubtedly is due to both tension and compression being
applied with insufficient time in a cycle to attain the equilibrium morphology. Examples are
shown in figure 17 for René 77 [4] and in figure 18 for René 80 [44], both second-generation
polycrystalline alloys that were used for turbine blades and continue to be used. A structure
similar to that shown in figure 17 was observed after only 50 cycles under the conditions given
in figure 17.

As would be expected, for strain-controlled LCF testing, a stress-coarsened precipitate
structure would be expected to show a decreasing stress range as coarsening continues and in
fact this was indeed observed. Figure 19 shows a continuous decrease in the stress range during
continuous cycling. The effects discussed so far are intrinsic for high-temperature deformation.
In the next section, the major extrinsic effect, oxidation, is briefly discussed.

(iii) Oxidation of Ni-base superalloys at high temperature

Not only are there phase changes and precipitate coarsening, there is also a very strong
environmental effect that is critical to consider. In general, oxides form at various boundaries
such as grain boundaries, twin boundaries and slip bands. Oxidation of all of these features is
shown in figure 20 for René 77. For many decades, the effects of oxidation appear to not have been
fully appreciated, with high-temperature damage in these alloys being assumed ipso facto to be
creep/ fatigue. Without minimizing the effects of creep during high-temperature fatigue, it should
be pointed out that both oxidation and creep rates obey equations of the same general form and
