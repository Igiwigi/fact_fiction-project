absorbing carbon dioxide, and freely exposed to the air, the dise being surrounded
with a rim in the same plane, and of a width three or four times its diameter.

If the air above the dise is perfectly still, the convergent streams of carbon dioxide
will creep through the air towards the disc, establishing a steady gradient of density,
and this creep will be a flux perpendicular to the lines of equal density, which will
thus form curved surfaces, or “shells,” surrounding the disc and terminating in
the rim.

The problem is mathematically the same as that presented by the electric field in
the neighbourhood of a conductor embedded in a surrounding non-conducting surface,
and having the same shape and dimensions as the absorbent disc. The curved
surfaces or “shells” of the gas of equal density are, in fact, the exact analogues of
the similarly curved surfaces of equipotential above the electrified disc, whilst
the converging lines of creep or flux of the gas are the analogues of the lines or
tubes of force, which bend round into the disc as they approach it.

By the aid of this electrostatic analogy we can explain why the flow of the
diffusing gas is found to vary with the linear dimensions of the absorbing disc.

This will be rendered evident on referring to fig. 1 (p. 256), which represents
a system of “shells” or zones of equal density arranged at such distances as to
