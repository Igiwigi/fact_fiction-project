to measure the displacement of a transyerse line of stakes planted previously in the mow.
I was standing at the time beside my theodolite, having waded to the position through
now which, being dry, reached nearly to my breast. A storm drifted up the valley,
darkening the air as it approached. It reached us, the snow falling more heavily than
ever I had seen it elsewhere. It s0on formed a heap on the theodolite ; till through
the telescope I was able to pick up at intervals the retreating forms of the men. Here
there was a combination of thick now in the air, and of soft fresh now on the ground
such as DERHAM could hardly have enjoyed. Through such an atmosphere, however, I
was able with my unaided voice to make my instructions audible for half a mile, while
the experiment was rendered reciprocal by one of my assistants* making his yoice
audible to me,

Many years ago I mentioned this fact in the presence of Sir Joux HERSCHEL, and I
haye a distinet recollection of the surprise with which he heard it. And, indeed, in
relation to our previous convictions, it is simply astonishing to observe the facility with
which sound makes its way among obstacles, and even penetrates solid bodies, s0 long
as the continuity of the air in their interstices is preserved. The following experiments
illustrate this.
