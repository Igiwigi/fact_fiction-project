It has also been suggested that in cases of non-uniform stress distribution, as, for example,
in the bending of a mild steel beam, yield will begin when the stress at the most highly
stressed point reaches the upper yield value, but that once the yielding process has been
initiated in this way additional material will yield at the lower yield stress. However, the
experiments of Robertson & Cook (1913), and others, have shown that yield always occurs
at the upper yield stress, and the experimental work described in the present paper provides
further confirmation of this point.

It is well known that the occurrence of yield in mild steel is accompanied by the formation
of Liiders lines. It seems probable, as suggested by Muir & Binnie (1926) and others, that
the material within the Liiders lines has undergone a considerable amount of slip, and has
in fact strained to the point ¢ in figure 1. The surrounding material is still entirely elastic,
and is sustaining only the lower yield stress. This elastic material is therefore subjected to

a stress considerably below the upper yield stress required to cause elastic breakdown.
Further yield as the overall strain is increased must therefore be initiated at points of stress
concentration along the boundaries of the Liiders lines, where there will exist ‘surfaces of
misfit’ between adjacent crystals owing to the discontinuity in the amount of slip that has
occurred.

This interpretation of the yield phenomenon in mild steel has been borne out by the
