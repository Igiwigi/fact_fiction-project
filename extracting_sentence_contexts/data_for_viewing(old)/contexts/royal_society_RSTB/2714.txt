which was situated above it. This element is indicated in Dr. TRaquatr’s figures
by the letter a, and is spoken of by him as “the additional lobe.” As it will be
frequently referred to, it requires a distinctive name, and in order to avoid as far as
possible the introduction of hypothesis into description, we propose to call it the
“gammation,” from its fancied resemblance to the Greek letter “ T.”

Another element, lying immediately in front of the gammation and nearer the
middle line, is almost entirely concealed by the nasal capsules, but is partly visible
in the posterior compartment of the nasal capsule of the left side in Plate 16, fig. 3.
This may be termed the pre-gammation.

A transverse division of the skull into a somewhat larger anterior and smaller
posterior portion may be made, owing to the fact that the gammation is more closely
connected with the nasal than with the auditory capsule, with which, indeed, it
never appears to come actually in contact. In one specimen-—the smallest—an
obvious deep groove divides the coherent anterior region from the posterior (Plate 17,
fig. 9).

The cranial cavity is open in front, behind and above. In the least distorted
specimens of large size its walls are steep, for the most part vertical, and thin, about
0'1 millim. in thickness, but in the smallest specimen at least twice as great.
Their height in proportion to the length of the skull i is by no means ineonsiderable ; ;
