two halteres of a fly oscillate at different frequencies (Sellke 1936; see also p. 357). This
treatment, which does not affect the ability of the insect to fly, would completely upset
any nervous mechanism dependent on phase comparisons between the two sides.

(7) It was pointed out above that in order to produce a simple theoretical treatment of
the dynamics of the haltere it is necessary to assume that the moving portion is a rigid
structure. If one examines more precisely the effect on the
dynamics of the system of departures from rigidity, it becomes
apparent that flexibility in a lateral direction is much more
serious than flexibility in a vertical direction. The full torque
of any gyroscopic system is only developed if the system is
restrained. Two features of the structure of the haltere suggest
that it is, in fact, much more resistant to lateral than to vertical
bending. These are (a) the oval section of the stalk, the major
axis of the oval being horizontal, and (b) the peculiar corruga-
tions of the dorsal and ventral scapal plates found in the higher ee
