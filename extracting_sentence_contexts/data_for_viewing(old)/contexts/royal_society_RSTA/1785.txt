be in the context of ultrasonic inspection methods, the authors believe that it will be of interest
and value in the exploitation of other NDE technologies.

Damage detection and identification technologies tend to be grouped according to application
contexts and domains; this leads to an apparent demarcation between them which is not always
useful. In the case of ultrasonic inspection, the approach crosses boundaries between NDE and
SHM, it is thus useful to discuss the apparent boundaries between technologies to establish if they
are useful, or actually limiting. This matter is important to discuss, because it will hopefully shed
light on whether other techniques commonly accepted to be NDE, could usefully be applied to
SHM problems or elsewhere.

The main aim of this paper will be to show that ultrasonic inspection has benefited from the
use of machine learning or data-based analysis techniques over the last few years. In fact, this :
observation is true of SHM generally, where the data-based approach is arguably the dominant : =
paradigm at this time [1]. The main intention of this paper is to inspire the more widespread a
possibilities of using data-based analysis, alongside physics-based techniques, in other areas of 13
NDE than ultrasound, e.g. in electromagnetic NDE. This paper will provide illustrations spanning 1
a range of machine learning applications to NDE, from using compressive sensing to handle the D8
large quantities of data obtained in ultrasonic inspection, to optimizing robotic scan paths for are
damage detection, and finally a state-of-the-art application of transfer learning. 5 99
