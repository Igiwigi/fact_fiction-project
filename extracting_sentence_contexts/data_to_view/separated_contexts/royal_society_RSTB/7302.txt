Several other examples of the whorl-forming tendency were found in Dipsacus, although
the experiments were not designed to test for this tendency, as were those on the Labiatae. Incidentally it may be noted that the whorl-forming tendency in the plants of these families


EXPERIMENTS ON BIJUGATE APICES 305

is not a tendency to form leaves in pairs, since it acts similarly on groups of three or more
leaves, if the junctional factors alone would have caused those leaves to arise nearly in
a whorl. The fact that normally in these plants the vegetative whorls contain two leaves
can be explained on junctional grounds. These matters and the experimental production
of spirals in decussate species were discussed more fully before (Snow 1942). The formation of whorls, therefore, in Dipsacus and in the decussates is an active and
primary process of some kind and is not merely a geometric consequence of the even numbers
of the parastichies, as Church maintained (1904).
