taking into consideration from the MALT results that 99% of all
Mycobacterium genus DNA reads found in the calculus were
exclusively of M. leprae origin rather than a different myco-
bacterium, we conclude that the remaining protein is in fact
from M. leprae as well.

content comparison in dentine and calculus

Endogenous human DNA found within the dentine and
the calculus followed a similar deamination pattern to that
previously observed by Mann eft al. [71]. In particular, the den-
tine sample had significantly higher deamination rates even
when normalizing the number of reads. By contrast, M. leprae
DNA deamination rates were similar regardless of source
