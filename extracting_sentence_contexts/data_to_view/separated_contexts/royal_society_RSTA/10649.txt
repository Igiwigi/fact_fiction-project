It must be remembered that the flame playing across the hearth of the furnace,
although at a very high temperature, is oxidising, and, as will be seen later (p. 498), it
should, at the most, give only feeble spectra of such elements as lithium, potassium,
calcium, and, we should infer, iron and probably manganese. The carbon monoxide
as it escapes from the bath of metal and slag would, however, tend to intensify the
spectra of these metals, and care was taken to turn the collimator in a direction
parallel to the surface of the bath and as near to its surface as the opening for the
door would allow. The temperature of the gas must be higher than the temperature of the walls of
the furnace which are heated by it, hence the fact of the sodium line being bright is
in accordance with KircHHorr’s law. Observations on the Flames from a Cupola Furnace. While at Crewe Works, eye observations were made on the spectra of the gases
passing the opening of a cupola through which the charge was introduced. _Pig-iron
was being melted in the cupola for the “acid” Bessemer process, while the blast was
turned on the flame was bluish, and lines of sodium, lithium, and potassium were
detected ; the latter were very weak.
