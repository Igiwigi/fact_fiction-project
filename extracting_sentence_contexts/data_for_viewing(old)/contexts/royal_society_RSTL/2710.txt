in respiration are supplied by the spinal marrow, but in this function it is an act of

volition which excites them. They are quiescent till this act takes place. Hence it
is that respiration ceases on the removal of the medulla oblongata, because by the
remoyal of this part of the brain the power of sensation in all parts below the head
and consequently of volition, as far as relates to those parts, is destroyed. Hence
also the fact, above referred to, that the vital has a remote dependence on the sen-
sitive system for the maintenance of its organs. If the muscles of respiration were
not in the strictest sense muscles of yoluntary motion, our powers of volition would
in an essential respect be imperfect ; for the due regulation of their action is essential
in the formation of articulate sounds, the chief means by which our sensorial powers
are enabled to influence those of other sentient beings.

In the papers on the Nature of Sleep and Death, published in the Philosophical Trans-
actions for 1833 and 1834, I have pointed ont how much the functions of the more
perfect animal are influenced by this peculiarity of respiration, the only vital fune-
tion, properly 80 called, in which the sensorial power cooperates; a cireumstance
which more generally perhaps than any other, which is equally of a local nature,
influences the phenomena both of health and disease. In this function therefore we
