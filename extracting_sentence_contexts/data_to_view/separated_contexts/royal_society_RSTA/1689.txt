Tn a single crystal the molecules are presumably in an equilibrium configuration of
maximum stability. In this event, the equilibrium of molecules at or near inter-
crystalline boundaries, in a body composed of a large number of crystals, must, in
general, be less stable than that of the molecules in the interior of the crystals. In
fact, where the orientation of the component crystals is haphazard, the stability of
the boundary molecules may be expected to range from the maximum of normal
crystallisation down to zero, %.Â¢., neutral equilibrium. If such a body be subjected
to a shear stress, some of the molecules in or near neutral equilibrium must, in general,
become unstable, and these will tend to rotate to new positions of equilibrium. This
rotation, however, will be strongly resisted, as has been seen, by forces doubtless of
a viscous nature, and its amount will accordingly depend on the time during which
the stress is applied.
