It is perhaps worth recording that the exudation rapidly reaches its full
value, being as great in the first observation on the stimulated muscle, usually about
3 minutes from the commencement of the stimulus, as later. (3) Like the oxygen consumption and the blood flow, this hyperexudation continues
long after the contractile period has passed off. These facts are shown in fig. 5. The more theoretical discussion of the relation of lymph flow to functional activity
may be postponed till we have considered the exudation in the submaxillary gland.
