652 MR. J. NORMAN LOCKYER ON SPECTRUM-ANALYSIS

It will be seen from the above that my researches have convinced me that, the opinion
held by the illustrious AxgerroM, that metallic elements (in which I include oe 7
have only one spectrum, is the only tenable one ; and it is to be hoped that science will
s00n be enriched by the results of more experiments similar to those recently made with
such 8uccess by Mr. SCHUSTER. |

SPECTRA OF THE METALLOIDS.

M1TSCHERLICH, in the paper to which I have 80 often referred, calls attention to the.
fact that the metalloids show the same spectra with regular shading as compound bodies;
but I think there is the difference to be remarked that, as a rule, the structure of the
spectrum of the metalloids extends further along the spectrum from the least refrangible
end than in the case of the spectra of compound bodies. As I do not think it is too
much to say that, as a rule, the lines of the metallic elements are more prominent in the ;
green and more refrangible parts of the spectrum than in the red (which may even be |
gathered from an inspection of the solar spectrum), the question arises whether it be a
possIbility that the molecules of a metalloid, in structure, lie between those of elements
on the one hand and compounds on the other.

Applications of these considerations to Solar and Stellar Spectra.

MrTSCHERLICH, in his firs; memoir, thus refers to the bearing of his observations with
