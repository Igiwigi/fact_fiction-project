From the data given in the above table we get again the law of intensity—
81°63: 71 = TIS 5 44 So Aiss She 2s ee

The above data obtained for light of the same intensity (and composition) on
repetition of the experiment: 84, 81, 82, 80, 81 millims. ; 43°5 and 44°5 millims. ;
32°5 and 31 millims. give a sufficient illustration that during the time the above
curves were taken, and with light of ‘such small intensity, which cannot affect
essentially the composition of the electrode exposed to the same, the same deflection
is obtained, and this shows that the chemical potential and solution pressure of the
same plates remain constant. The cell is reversible, as it follows from the considera-
tion of the reactions going on in it, and from the course of the above curves, the
induction and deduction periods of which show no polarisation, while the system
always returns to its former state, whenever on removal of the light we allow the
deduction period to become complete. It is constant, as is shown by the shape of the
parts of the curves giving the induction and deduction periods, from the straight
line cc, obtained in light, parallel to the line a-b in the dark, and from the fact that
on repetition of the experiment the same maximum deflection is obtained.

(3) Plate 13 (b) of July 29, 1903, contains 18 Curves, Table III.—The same
system was investigated a few hours later, first with acetylene, then with the are. Acetylene light and coloured screens (curves N1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), Experimental
data, see Table II., pp. 392-393. In curve N1 the total acetylene light as before was used, at a distance = 116
centims. ; the deflection was 80 millims.
