When submitted to distillation this compound is decomposed like the analogous
substances, the product being water, pure olefiant gas, which was identified as formerly,
and a very remarkable nitrile-base, containing the three different alcohol-radicals, an
ammonia, in fact, in which the first equiv. of hydrogen is replaced by methyl, the
second by ethyl, the third by amy], and which receives the name methylethylamyl-
amine.

This reaction shows that ethyl yields its place even to methyl, a fact which could
not have been anticipated from analogy, methyl occupying a lower position than
ethyl in the system. The above deportment is moreover remarkable, when con-
sidered in another point of view. The elimination of methyl in the case under
examination would have given rise to the formation of methylene* C, H,, a substance
the existence of which is still very problematical.

Methylethylamylamine is a transparent bil of a fragrant odour and an analogous
taste. Both these properties are much more marked than those of diethylamylamine,
which it resembles in most respects. It is s0mewhat more s0luble in water than the
latter, and of a more decided alkaline character. When dried over potassa and rec-
tified, the new base boils constantly at 135%. Hence its boiling-point is 154 —135=19®
lower than that of dietbylamylamine, a difference which is in perfect accordance
