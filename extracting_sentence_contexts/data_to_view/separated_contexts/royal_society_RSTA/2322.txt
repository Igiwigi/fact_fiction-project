the generic formula
R.M (SO,),. 6H,O, but are not eutropic with them ; the potassium, rubidium, and
esium salts alone form the exclusive eutropic series, in which the crystallographic
(morphological and physical) properties obey the law of progression with the atomic
weight of the alkali metal, which has been established in the previous communica-
tions concerning those salts. This law is particularly well illustrated by the fact, to
which no exceptions have been observed, that the average change of angle between
the crystal faces, and also the maximum change of interfacial angle (which usually
oceurs for the all-important monoclinic axial angle between the primary faces,
and exceeds between a K and a Cs salt two whole degrees), are directly propor-
tional to the change in atomic weight, when any one alkali metal is replaced by
another. :

(2) The dimensions of the space-lattice of any ammonium salt of the series are
nearly identical with those of the intermediate alkali metal salt, that containing
rubidium as the R-metal; so that the two atoms of rubidium are replaced by the
ten atoms of the two NH, radicle-groups without appreciably altering the crystallo-
graphic structural dimensions. To these may be added the following third general conclusion, which has been
substantiated as regards thallium in a former communication* :â€” (3) The salts of
this series in which R is thallium resemble the ammonium salts closely, in truly
belonging to the isomorphous series, but not to the more exclusive eutropic series
formed by the salts of potassium, rubidium, and cesium.
