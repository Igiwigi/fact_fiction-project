Bane and Overton (19) found that the presence of calcium salts reduced the
toxicity of cobra venom to tadpoles immersed in it, and I have therefore tested
whether calcium lactate and chloride possess any antidotal action in mammals; these
salts were injected intravenously after the cobra action was well developed. I could
not find that they had any effect whatever on the progress of the poison. Animals anesthetised with urethane, paraldehyde or veronal generally survive
under the minimal lethal dose of venom longer than normal animals, and in fact
urethane is the most efficient antidote that I have met. It prolonged the intoxication
very distinctly in many cases, and in some seemed to promise recovery, although the
animals all died in the course of the night, probably from excessive heat loss. This
action of urethane was at first puzzling, but is susceptible of a simple explanation.
