In observations of the kind which we had to make it would have been useless to
take exact measurements in number of degrees, and we contented ourselves with the
sional use of the qualifications “large” and ‘‘small” to express the relationship
to each other of the two phases of the diphasic variation which usually came under
our observation. Any electrical inequality between the two led-off points was compensated in the
usual manner by means of a SANDERSON’s potentiometer ; we used the same instru-

Our observations by the galvanometer are in the main confirmatory for the
Mammalian heart of the fundamental facts established on the Frog’s heart by the
researches of ENGELMANN, BurpoN SANDERSON, MarcHanp, and others, but with
certain reservations and amid frequent irregularities, owing to the presumably more
mobile nature of the Mammalian organ. We know already, from the observations of


ACTION OF THE EXCISED MAMMALIAN HEART. 233

Kotiiker and Mitier,* that the spontaneous systole of the Mammalian heart is
accompanied (or rather preceded) by an electromotive change ; to this we have to add
that the electromotive change is frequently diphasic, and entirely similar to the
diphasic variation of the spontaneously beating Frog’s heart.
