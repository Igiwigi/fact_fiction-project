MULLER, RE-
GIOMONTANUS, sive Joannes de Monte Regio, who flou-
rished about A. D. 1460, and, in a posthumous treatise ex-
pressly on this subject, intitled Scripta clarissimi Mathema-
ti M. Joaxnnis REciomMonTANi de Torqueto, Astrolabio
armillari, Reguld magnd Ptolemaicd, Baculoque Astronomico,
&c. &c, in quarto, printed at Nuremberg in 1544, has
given a pretty full account, not only of the armillary as-
trolabe, but also of the torquetum, which in fact was no-
thing more than a portable equatorial, and may be consi-
dered as the first instrument truly of this kind. As this trea-
tise is become extremely scarce, and I know of only one
copy in this kingdom, I take this opportunity of apprizing
the curious, that it is to be met with in the Britich Museum. A $hort description, however, of the torquetum, with a plate
of the instrument, will be found in Mons, BAaiLLY's Astro-



of the Equatorial Instrument. 69

nomie Moderne, Tome I. p. 687; and a description of the as-
trolabium armillare of PToLEMY, according to RE610MONTA=
Nus's conception of it, who may be considered as the best com-
mentator upon the Almagest now to be met with, will be
found in WEIDLER's Historia Astronomic, quarto, 1741.

(3-) The next author that presents himself is Cortrnicus,
(who lived in 1530) and in his work De Revolutione Orbium
colestium, lib. 2. c. 14, De exquirendis Stellarum Locis, pro-
fessedly describes the same instrument with PToLEMY ; but,
as it appears to me, something more complicated, having a
greater number of circles, and in truth what in later times has
been understood by the name, Armillary Sphere.

(4-) After Cortrniovs, I find, in a work of Arian, who
was his contemporary, or a little after him, viz. about 1538, a
complete description of the torquetum, with all the parts of
it minutely detailed, assisted by four or five wooden plates,
together with the use of the instrument.
