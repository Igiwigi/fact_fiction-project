To act as a transmitter, ATP has to negotiate the plasma membrane of the
ATP releasing cell before it can act—sometimes after breakdown as ADP,
AMP or adenosine—on purinergic receptors (P1, P2X or P2Y) on a targeted
cell. Four pathways for ATP release need to be considered.

(A) Like many other transmitters, ATP can be released by exocytosis. In fact,
often ATP is co-packaged and co-released with classical transmitters, such as
acetylcholine or norepinephrine [10-13]. Further support for exocytotic/vesicu-
lar ATP release is the identification of vesicular ATP transport proteins [14,15]. Exocytosis allows for fast and targeted release of ATP onto receptors and is the
prominent if not exclusive ATP release mechanism at nerve terminals [16,17].

(B) Several observations indicate the existence of alternative ATP release
pathways.
