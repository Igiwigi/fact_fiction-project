set of requirements with a direct geometrical interpretation.


The statement: ... to formulate the physical requirements so completely that the mathematical 3 |
formalism becomes uniquely determined by them ..., contained in the above-mentioned paper with

von Neumann and Nordheim [5], leaves few doubts that, in this paper, Hilbert had in mind 3
for physics what he had realized more than 27 years before for geometry in the monograph [9]. : o
However, there is also a deep difference between the 1899 monograph [9] and the 1927 paper [5]: : <
in the former, Hilbertâ€™s approach is purely syntactic, in the sense that the author insists that the : Zs
names of the objects considered have no importance, the only important thing being the rules of 1g

their combinations (axioms). Probably he had in mind facts such as an object which is interpreted
as a straight line in Euclidean geometry becomes a point in projective geometry. But in the later
paper the insistence on physical requirements emphasizes a semantical dimension which is absent
in the monograph.

This can be explained by observing that Hilbert did not explicitly relate the programme of his

paper with von Neumann and Nordheim with his sixth problem. It seems that the authors of this : =
paper, although clearly understanding that the quantum model is based on a new probabilistic : S
formalism, did not realize that the emergence of this new formalism naturally raises the following 2
problem: either the new formalism is superfluous and everything can be dealt with using the old aed
probabilistic formalism, which is the thesis of the hidden variable theories, or it is necessary. But in 22
this case the difference between the two mathematical formalisms is a clear indication of the fact [4
