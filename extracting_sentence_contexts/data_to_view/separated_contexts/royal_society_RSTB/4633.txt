There are numerous other cases where the same thing has
occurred, but in these the active numbers at the time of sampling are sufficient to
account for the bacterial changes. From an inspection of the figures it is not possible to decide whether the inter-
action is primarily one in which the amoebe influence the bacteria or vice versd. The
possibility of the bacterial changes initiating those in the amcebee is, however, entirely
rul.d out by the fact that the contingency tables show no positive correlation
between the changes in numbers of the active forms in the two amoebae. INVESTIGATION OF BACTERIAL AND PROTOZOAN POPULATION OF THE SOIL. 335
