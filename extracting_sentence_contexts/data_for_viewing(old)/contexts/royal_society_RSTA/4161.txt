Note that the two possible signs of p(t;) and p(t,), which are not encoded in the generating
function itself, are obtained from the two possible signs of the generating function when
expressing the cosine in equation (2.8) by exponentials.

However, it turns out that the boundary conditions (3.2) give rise to continuous families of
trajectories originating from the U(1)-gauge invariance, i.e. from the fact that if w(t) solves the
equations of motion under the boundary conditions (3.2) then w(te' also does. Therefore, one of
the 2L integrations, e.g. the one over q, cannot be performed in stationary phase approximation.

In fact, it turns out to be beneficial to transform the integrations over qt! ) into integrations

over afi! defined by

ay =2b,/ a + 3 cos(6(” + a), (3.3)
q? =2by n + 4 cos(ol? +00), for >1 (3.3b)

and a = 2b n® + 3 cos(a\”). (3.3c)
