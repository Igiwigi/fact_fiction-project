evidence is very imperfect and inconclusive, I am disposed, from a cast of the
Freiberg specimen of Protorosaurus which Dr. Woopwarp has obtained for the
British Museum, to think that the scapular arch in that specimen probably includes
pre-coracoid elements, and may be constructed upon the Anomodont plan. The

circumstance that teeth occur upon the bones of the palate in Procolophon, and that
the vomera meet the pterygoid bones with the palatines external to them in the same
relative positions as in my restoration of Protorosaurus (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ B., vol.
178 (1887), p. 205), would prepare me to find other points of correspondence in the
skulls of those types, while the fact that the Anomodonts occur in the Permian
rocks of France and Russia makes an affinity with that type less improbable in the
Thiiringerwald Saurians.

Comparison of the Anomodontia with the Saurischia.

The skeleton is imperfectly known in the Saurischia in details of structure ; but the
following resemblances may have value as showing affinity.

The ilium in both types may be extended behind the acetabulum as well as in front
of it; but in several genera there is a tendency for the anterior extension to be the
more conspicuous. The pubis and ischium meet by a median vertical suture; but
while these bones are thus united in known Anomodonts down to the median
