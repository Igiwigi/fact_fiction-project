= and the East Greenland current.

These three currents are in fact only the same; they begin, as is well known, in the
& Bay of Benin, under the Equator, and the main current runs straight to the west over
S the Atlantic to Cape Roque, on the east coast of South America. I certainly shall not
Stry to lessen the weight of the arguments which assign the cause of this equatorial
S current to the rotatory motion of the earth, but I will only give some remarks as to
8 other influences that act to the same effect.

1f we compare the quantity of salt which is found in sea-water in the region between

* To compare these observations of specific gravity with the quantity of salt in different depths, which I
haye mentioned in the former part of this paper, I shall here refer to some experiments which T have made to
obtain a ratio by which I could compute the quantity of salts in the sca-water from the specific gravity, and
vice vers&, IT have compared, in thirteen specimens of sea-water, the specific gravity with the quantity of
