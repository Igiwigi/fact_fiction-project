HICKS ON THE MOTION OF TWO SPHERES IN A FLUID.

consider the case where one sphere is inside the other. An approximation to the
value of the coefficients of v,? and »; v, is given in F 15, Tt is remarkable that in the
case of two cylinders the coefficients of the terms in u?, +? are equal, while those of
wu Ug and v, vg are equal and opposite. But this is due to the fact that in a cylinder
the image of a doublet (or a source) is a single doublet, whatever be the direction of
the axis of the original doublet.
