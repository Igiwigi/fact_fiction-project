they have done me the honour of printing, I have given an

an opinion of M. M. Gay Lussac and THENARD, with respect
to the agency of potassium and ammonia, even on their own
statement of facts, as detailed in the Moniteur for May 27,
1808,

The general obscurity belonging to these refined objects of
research, their importance and connection with the whole of
chemical theory, have induced me since that time to apply to
them no inconsiderable degree of labour and attention ; and
the results of my inquiries will, I trust, be found not only to
confirm my former conclusions ; but likewise to offer some
novel views.

In the first of these series of operations on the action of
potassium on ammonia, I used retorts of green glass ; I then
