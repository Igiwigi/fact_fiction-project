The diffusion of epidemics is here described as a result of the
interactions between a large number of individuals, each one having a different social propensity. In this respect, as shown in Dimarco et al. [18] and Zanella et al. [19], the fundamental tools
of statistical physics are capable of providing a useful insight into epidemiological dynamics
linking classical compartmentalization approaches with a statistical understanding of the social
aspects. In fact, the essential multiscale nature of kinetic theory permits us to determine the
resulting macroscopic (or aggregate) and measurable characteristics of the evolution of the
disease [19]. One of the key directions we pursue in this research is given by the combination
of consolidated theoretical and modelling tools [17] with data-driven techniques. More precisely,
starting from the data at our disposal, we calibrate our mathematical model passing through
the determination of the relevant epidemiological parameters of the epidemic from the data.
