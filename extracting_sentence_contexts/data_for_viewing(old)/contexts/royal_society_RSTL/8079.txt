from this the value of 4 was calculated by the trigonometrical tables. Finally,
Nn=2914.
As the result of observation 2 had been estimated at 252.
In another case,

L=5-767, a="587, $=3-737, n by observation=351.

The result of calculation is n=350-3. These are the only two instances in which I
have tried the formula (20a). It is 80mewhat troublesome in use, but appears to repre-
sent the facts very closely ; though I do not pretend that the above would be average
samples of a large series. There is no necessity for the irregularity at the lower end
taking the form of an enlargement. For example, the formula might be applied to a
truly cylindrical pipe with a ball of solid material resting at the bottom.]

IT had intended to have made these experiments more complete, particularly on mul-
tiple resonance, but haye not hitherto had time. However, the results obtained seem
