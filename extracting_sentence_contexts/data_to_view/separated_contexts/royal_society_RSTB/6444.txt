It is also very. noticeable when
an animal is taking in carmine that the amount entering the mid-gut or enclosed in
the food cord varies from period to period; reference has been made above to variation
in the amount of carmine caught in the anterior end of the lateral ciliated tract,
which would depend on variation in the amount passing down the oesophagus. It is
clear that in the oral-hood cirri and the velar tentacles and velum the animal has
a mechanism for controlling the quantity of particles entering with the incurrent
stream of water, and in view of the above conclusions it seems physiologically possible
for a period of intake of food to alternate with a period of rest, while allowing the
digestion and absorption of food to proceed continuously, although how far this
actually occurs under natural conditions cannot be said. Finally, it may be noted that
the above account explains how absorption can take place although the “‘ faecal masses”’
pass relatively quickly down the hind-gut (see p. 273), for the whole process is governed
by the rotation occurring under the influence of the ilio-colon ring, and depends upon
the fact that the food mass can remain for a considerable time in the latter region
while particles are distributed from it over the epithelium:
