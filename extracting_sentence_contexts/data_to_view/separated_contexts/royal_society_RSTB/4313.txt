There
are many Australian skulls which present a primitive shape in this region, in contrast
with the European type of small palate with the teeth arranged in a gentle curve
with diverging posterior limbs. These Australian palates with their more quad-
rangular shape are reminiscent of the anthropoid condition, but in no present-day
skull have I been able to detect this peculiarity developed to such an extent as in
the Talgai specimen. Fig. 2, showing the effect of the superposition of the tracing of
the Talgai palate on those of the most primitive type of Australian, a reconstruction
of the Piltdown (Kxrru, 8), and a modern Englishman illustrates these facts
graphically. The characteristic shape of the palate is obviously to be connected
with the great size of the canine teeth and the broad premaxillary region which has
previously been described. This figure and fig. 8 further establish the important
fact that the peculiarity of the Talgai palate resides mainly in the anterior portion of
the jaw bearing the incisor, canine, and premolar teeth.
