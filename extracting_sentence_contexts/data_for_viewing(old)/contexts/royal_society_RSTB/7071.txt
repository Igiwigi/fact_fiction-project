OF LINKAGE IN POLYSOMIC INHERITANCE 81

When three genes are present at each locus, the only possible component of deficiency is
that common to the bisimplex and the biduplex digenic types and, in fact, the smallest of
the three sets trigenic at both loci in table 19 has a matrix deficient in this component. The
two remaining sets, of eighteen and thirty-six genotypes respectively, are not in any way
deficient, having gametic matrices of rank 11.

This is true also for the conjugate pair of sets of thirty-six genotypes having three genes
at one locus and four at the other (table 20). There are in this case seventy-eight different
kinds of gametes, but in respect of mode of formation these fall into only twenty-nine classes,
ten homogenic at the locus with four genes, and nineteen heterogenic. The first class is
produced only by modes of gamete formation 2, 4, 8, 10, and the second class by the re-
maining seven modes of gamete formation. The gametic matrix thus falls into two portions.
These gametic matrices are written out (table 20) for the genotype a, B/a,B/a,b/a,b'; by
permutation of the four a-genes and the three b-genes, the equivalent matrices may be found
