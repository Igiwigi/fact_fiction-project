This fact has also been the subject of but little attention, though A. Dupri* has
undertaken some interesting experiments about the height to which a jet can rise. A closer examination of how the reduction of velocity corresponding to h, spreads
itself over the jet I am obliged to leave to another opportunity, only a particular
characteristic fact being named here. If the pressure is reduced more and more so
that it comes near to the value h,+h, the jet can be observed to deviate more and
more from a parabola, the curvature of the jet just outside the hole becoming much
too great. If the pressure is reduced almost to h,+h, the jet first runs a short
distance horizontally and then falls vertically down.
