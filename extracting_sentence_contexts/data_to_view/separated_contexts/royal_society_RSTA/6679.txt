Comparing the curve s = 4 of figure 17 with curve A of figure 18, it is clear that the dis-
tortion increases when s decreases, other quantities remaining constant; comparing curves
Aand B in figure 18, it is seen that the distortion increases as x increases, when the remaining
variables are unchanged. Thus, to minimize the distortion due to dispersion, it is advisable
to use a pressure bar whose radius and length are as small as possible. These general conclusions agree with those derived from the investigation of the pro-
pagation of a pulse (see § 12), and they are confirmed by experiments to be described later.

(d) The variation of stress and displacement over the cross-section of the bar

The non-uniformity of the longitudinal stress and displacement over the cross-section of
the bar, the deviation of the radial displacement from the simple linear law, and the fact
that the radial stress does not vanish have already been mentioned as results of the general
theory of the vibrations of a cylinder. These results have an important bearing on the
measurement of pressure by the condenser units used in this work, since the aim in all
the experiments is to determine the average normal pressure over the cross-section of
the bar. When a parallel-plate condenser unit is used, it is the longitudinal displacement averaged
over the measuring end of the bar that is measured, and the non-uniformity of longitudinal
stress and displacement means in general that the ratio of the mean normal pressure to the
mean longitudinal velocity will be a function of a/A and ¢ instead of being equal to pcp.
