at the origin is + *, and the curve is as drawn in fig. 9. This immediately verifies the
fact that when » = 0 and v = 0, the shape of the stream lines are those given by VON
KArmMAN. When 2-229 > u > x/4/3, wu (0, — cc) is never zero and the stream lines
are either of type 4 (6) or 4 (g), with the type 6 (c) in the transition stage (see fig. 6). The curve giving the intermediate type is the curve S(X, }#)=1.
