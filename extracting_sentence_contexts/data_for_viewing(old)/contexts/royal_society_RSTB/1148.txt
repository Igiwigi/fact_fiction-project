since in independent experiments lesions effected quite differently show in the one
case that the posterior columns are concerned with 78 per cent., in the other with
76 per cent. of the effect. As the experimental details accumulate, this steady
quantitative relation will be found to vary wonderfully little, considering the nature
of the structure investigated and the difficulties connected with the method.

The experiment just alluded to also indicates a very important fact which will be
referred to in detail in the concluding section of this work, namely, that when the
stimulus is minimal the nerve impulses are almost entirely confined to the direct
path ; in other words, this path is that of least resistance. It is necessary for the
stimulus to be of a certain intensity before nerve impulses can be started of sufficient
volume to break through corpuscular structures and so enter on indirect paths. This
is indicated by the fact that no change in the deflection could be observed in the case
of the weak initial stimulus to follow the section of the grey matter ; presumably,
therefore, the cord effect was due, in this case, to afferent impulses passing up the
direct path.

A further extension of the experiment just described may be now referred to,
namely, the influence of dividing in addition one posterior column. After the section
of the anterior or ventral portion of the cord the left posterior column was divided at
the 10th dorsal vertebra; on now stimulating the left sciatic nerve an effect of 8 only
was obtained, this observation being repeated several times. The importance of the
posterior column on the side of the nerve is thus forcibly brought into view,
