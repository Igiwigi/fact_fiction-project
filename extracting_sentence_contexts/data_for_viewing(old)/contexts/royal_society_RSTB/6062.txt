J. P. HILL ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY OF THE PRIMATES. 155

“ovum,” originally described by J. W. Minter (13) in 1913. Unfortunately only
five sections of the series through it were preserved, but of these StREETER (’27) has
more recently provided an excellent detailed account, illustrated by very fine photo-
micrographs, so that we now possess a fairly adequate knowledge of this most interesting
stage in human ontogeny, estimated as belonging to the 10th or 11th day after ovulation.
I refer to it here because it provides us with an extraordinarily striking and concrete
illustration of that developmental precocity which characterises the earlier stages in
human development.

The blastocyst is completely implanted, but the facts that the outer margin of its
trophoblastic wall lies only 0-17 mm. below the uterine surface and the further fact
that its presence has induced so far very little alteration in the surrounding endometrial
tissue, lead SrREETER to conclude that it can only recently have become imbedded. Its
average internal diameter (measured from the inner surface of the trophoblast) is only
0-35 mm., nevertheless its trophoblast is already well differentiated. It has an average
thickness of 0-22 mm. and consists of a well-marked basal layer of cytotrophoblast
in proliferative continuity with an irregular layer of sponge-like syncytiotrophoblast
composed of coarse anastomosing nucleated trabecule enclosing lacunar spaces of
variable size. Peripherally, the syncytiotrophoblast is in contact with the surrounding
endometrial tissue and has already commenced to erode the endothelial walls of its
capillaries, though maternal blood corpuscles have not yet penetrated into its lacunae.
Beyond this erosion, the endometrial tissue is very little altered, many of the stroma
cells in the neighbourhood of the blastocyst are beginning to enlarge and mononuclear
