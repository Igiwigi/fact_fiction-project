On the other are the
lateral blood spaces which are constantly being emptied into the dorsal blood space and so
to the blood pump. Clearly then there must be high pressure on the afferent side and low

pressure on the efferent, and this in itself is sufficient to ensure a passage in one direction
through the cirri. However, even if the pressure on both sides of the cirrus were the same,
there is, I think, in the basis of the limb, a beautiful adaptation which, though not struc-
turally a valve of the usual type, must in fact act as one when the limbs are being cast. In transverse sections (figure 8) it will be seen that the afferent vessel occupies the whole
of a cavity of a ridge on the inner edge of the basal joint, and is separated from the muscle
and the parenchyma by a very definite wall of connective tissue. On the other hand, the
efferent vessel is embedded in a mass of parenchyma.
