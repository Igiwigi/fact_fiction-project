and a very much higher value for Â¢.

(b) Out of the first six groups four are either Lepidoptera or include Lepidoptera
(e.g., all insects).

(c) Families of Diptera hold positions 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12.

(d) Five out of the last six positions are groups that are neither Lepidoptera nor
Diptera.

It would appear from this that the effect was at its maximum in the Lepidoptera,
next in Diptera, and lower in other groups. Since all the differences dealt with are
logarithmic or geometric ratios the fact that the Diptera make up a large proportion
of the catch should not affect their position.


ACTIVITY OF NOCTURNAL INSECTS 385

There is, however, one other point of possible importance. Work on the distri-
bution of insects during the night (Writrams, 1935) has shown that Noctuidae have
their maximum flight round about midnight (in periods 4 and 5), the Geometridae
a little earlier in period 3, and the Crambidae still earlier in period 2. On the other
hand, the Chironomidae have their maximum flight at dusk in period 1 with a sub-
maximum at dawn (period 8) ; the Coleoptera and Psocoptera both have their
maximum in period 1 ; the Jassidae resemble the Coleoptera, and the Aphidae had
