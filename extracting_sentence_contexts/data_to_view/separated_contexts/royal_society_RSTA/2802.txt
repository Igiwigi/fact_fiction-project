Nevertheless, the general build of the series
is so similar to that of the others that it would seem probable that the wave numbers
should also be of the form 8(«)—N/(m+d,,). If so it is possible to calculate d,,
from the observations and a comparative study may throw some light on the origin of
the different lines. The attempt to deal with these series from the formule point of
view, however, brought out the fact that the satellites are related to the strong lines
in a similar way to that in which the Principal line doublets are, viz., by a constant
difference in the denominators and that their differences probably depend on
multiples of the “oun,” as is the ease in the Principal series. As the evidence
depends also on a comparison of the numerical values of d,,, this point will also be
considered now. The actual values of d,, will depend on the accuracy of the value S (c) (or D())
of the limit.
