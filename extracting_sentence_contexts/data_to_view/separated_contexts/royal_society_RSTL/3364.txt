Ivszxcrs ,, 8| 160 Blue Bottle Fly (Musca vomitoria) Perhaps the most interesting conelusion deducible from the above Table, is the
uniformity of the mean number of strize in a given space in the six divisions included
in it. The next remarkable fact is, that in each division a great yariety is observable
in their number, not only in an average of all the examples examined, but in single
specimens. And I may add, that this variety has been observed continually, both on
contiguous fasciculi, and on the same fasciculus in different parts. I have not con-
$idered it requisite to detail the particulars of each observation.
