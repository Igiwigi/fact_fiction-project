Similar summation
series coupled with other F series age also common. It probably explains also the
crowding of F separations in spectra like that of Cu in short wave regions far beyond
the F limit which has always appealed to me as a difficulty. It is possible that
summation series may also exist for the P.S.D. series in all elements, but, as a rule,
the limits of these are far larger than the F(), with the consequence that any
P.S.D. lines must lie very far in the ultra-violet, a fact which explains why such types
if existing have not hitherto been recognised. The existence of these summation
series is thoroughly established and their importance as bearing on theories of the
origin of spectral lines is evident. They would seem difficult to explain on any of the
current theories.
