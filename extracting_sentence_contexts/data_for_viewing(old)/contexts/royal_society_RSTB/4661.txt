at its formation, and its chromatin forms a dense peripheral layer (fig. 98). This
stage quickly passes, and the nucleus enlarges again, while the chromatin at the
same time becomes resolved into granules (fig. 99), which, when the nucleus has
reached its full size, are seen to be connected by an intricate network of linin
threads (figs. 100, 101a, 6).

Normally, the nucleus of the zygote is in this open, resting condition before
infection occurs, the whole process of cell and nuclear fusion having been accom-
plished on or near the surface of the potato tissue. Certain abnormalities have been
observed. They usually take the form of what is apparently the late arrival of
a second zoospore after the first has begun to penetrate the epidermis. Provided
penetration has not advanced too far, fusion is effected, and the zygote nucleus is
formed. The fact that two zoospores have already fused does not act as a deterrent
to a third, and cases have been found in which a zoospore is firmly perched on the
top of an entering zygote.

No real membrane is formed round the zygote, but a slight condensation of
protoplasm takes place at the surface, and, should plasmolysis occur, this outer layer
remains in position, while the protoplasm within contracts (fig. 107).

Fig. 102 shows an aggregation of zygotes in a depression on the surface of a
tumour. Two ruptured sori lie opposite the cavity at a little distance from it, but
they are not shown in the figure. With the exception of a few zoospores which had
settled in another depression they all entered the cavity depicted and there fused.
No zoospores or zygotes were to be seen on the level portion of the tumour where cell
