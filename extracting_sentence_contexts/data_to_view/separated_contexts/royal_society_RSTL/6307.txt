© SOME OF THE ANIMALS FED AND SLAUGHTERED AS HUMAN FOOD. 521

© Looking more particularly to the first Division in the Table (VII.), which shows the
-— ollective composition of the carcasses, and comparing one animal with another, there is
-— een to be a general disposition to a rise or fall in the percentage of mineral matter.
- ith the rise or fall in that of the nitrogenous compounds. In fact, all the results tend
- o 8how a prominent connexion between the amount of the mineral matters, and that

Ff the nitrogenous constituents of the body. Next comparing the relative proportions of Fat, and of nitrogenous compounds, in the
lifferent Carcasses, it is seen, that, in every instance excepting that of the Calf (in which
ae the percentages of nitrogenous substance and of fat were equal), there was con-
iderably more of dry fat than of dry nitrogenous compounds. In the Carcass even of

A he 8fore or lean Sheep, there was more than one and a half time as much fat as nitro-
