In
sections such as I have just been considering a rich series of arcuate fibres will also
be found extending backwards through the extra-limbic lobe from the anterior realms
of the brain, which thin out gradually towards the abrupt line of denser medulla,
commencing at the limbic sulcus, and wholly disappear here. This is the arcuate
system of the extra-limbic medulla. The above facts enable me to conelude that at the occipital pole of the hemisphere
there are two important regions definitely mapped out by coarse external configuration
of the brain and also by minate structural divergences. These regions are histologically distinguished by the possession of a cortex, which is
peculiar to each, and which we have named respectively the modified upper and lower
limbic types. Each region is associated with that of the opposite hemisphere by the
callosal commissure.
