In view of this result, and the fact that most of the numbers recorded by Austin
as values of received antenna current at distances exceeding 500 sea miles are less

than 29, it seemed to be worth while to see if agreement between MAcpona.p’s
formula (54°) and observation could be attained by supposing the amplitude of the
electromagnetic waves at great distances, and therefore the values of the received
antenna current, to be proportional to the audibility factor instead of its square root.
I therefore compared the formula in the first instance with Hocan’s long-distance
observations. The result of the comparison is shown in figs. 3 and 4, in which the
abscissee of the points marked with crosses represent distances, and the ordinates the
