Article Nos. 43 and 44.

43. We have considered 80 far relations which involve only the coordinates (&, y,...)*;
the coefficients are purely numerica], or, if literal, they are absolute constants, which
either do or do not satisfy certain conditions ; if they do not, the relation assumed in
the first instance to be fold is really k-fold, or, as we may express it, the relation is
really as well as formally þ-fold ; if they do satisfy certain relations in virtue whereof
the formally &-fold relation is really less than /-fold, say, it is (£&—1)fold, then the rela-
tion is in fact to be considered ab initio as a (E&—1)fold relation : there is no question of
a relation being in general {-fold and becoming less than &-fold, or suffering any other
modification in its form ; and the notion of a more than m-fold relation is in the pre-
ceding theory meaningless. '

44. But a relation between the coordinates (#, y, . . .)
