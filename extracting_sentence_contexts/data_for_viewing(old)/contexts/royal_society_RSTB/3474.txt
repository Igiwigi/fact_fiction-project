surrounding scales, just as the two wings and bilateral structure of the Welwitschian
outer integument are correlated with the position of the ovule closely appressed in
the axil of a bract.

The ovule with its long stalk would thus be homologous with the shortly stalked
female flower of Welwitschia, and I should regard some at any rate of the intraseminal
scales in Bennettites as the equivalent of the bracts in Welwitschia and probably of
the ovuliferous scales in the Cycads. The scales are here of course more numerous
than the ovules, and it is probable that some of them were sterile. The argument
which has already been advanced’ for the primitively foliar origin of the ovule in

Welwitschia and has consequently been extended to the Bennettitales, receives further
support from the fact that the microsporangia in the latter are obviously foliar, and
are thus more primitive in character than the stalked microsporangia in Welwitschia.
