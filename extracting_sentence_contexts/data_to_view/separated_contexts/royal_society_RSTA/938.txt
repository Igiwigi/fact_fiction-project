In the act of solution the nitrocotton molecules surrounded by absorbed acetone
separate from each other. If the solution is dilute, }Â°% or less, each solvated molecule

will not interfere much with its neighbours and the solvation will rise as the activity
rises without any break being seen at the solution point. This is in accord with the
facts because, as has already been noted, the solvation has been found to rise with
increasing acetone activity if the solutions are dilute, but in concentrated solutions
the conditions are not the same; the chain molecules are in constant contact with
one another and it may be supposed that where contact takes place water is also in
some form of combination. The results of this are that the apparent sorption of
acetone in concentrated solutions is lowered. Thus, although the total solvation of
acetone continues to rise as the concentration of acetone increases in the concentrated
solution, the apparent solvation which alone can be determined is found to fall,
