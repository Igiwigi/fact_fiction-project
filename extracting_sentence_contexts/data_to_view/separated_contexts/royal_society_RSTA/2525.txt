The solution reduces the total flood volume by 27% compared to the ‘do-nothing’
option (table 3), i.e. is marginally more effective than in the high emissions scenario. Both BCs and PPs are considered to capture (up to) 80% of runoff from impervious areas
and 50% from pervious areas. The difference reflects the fact that there is typically more control
over pre-engineered areas. Interventions are implemented in the drainage areas upstream of the
manholes predicted by the model to flood, with any excess runoff flowing to the immediately
