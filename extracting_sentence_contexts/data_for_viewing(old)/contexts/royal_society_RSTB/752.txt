the vermiform sheathed organism sought for could be grown in the medium (Hay-
puck’s solution) mentioned, and, secondly, that it could be developed apart from the
yeast. .

Having now obtained the long-sought organism—the sheathed Schizomycete—
separate from other forms, it promised to be a comparatively easy task to cultivate
it pure in hanging drops under the microscope ; but this proved to be by no means
so simple as I supposed.

After numerous failures, due in part to the unsuitable media, and in part to the
sensitiveness of the organism to transference from tube-cultures to the hanging
drops, I arrived at results by the use of beet-gelatine and of bouillon-Pasteur-
gelatine. Difficulties arose from the facts that the sheathed organism will not
readily grow as such in gelatine, and that it was necessary to employ as little as
possible of this medium—only just as much as would suffice to slightly fix the
specimens. I used about 1-2 per cent., according to the temperature. The next
obstacle was the frequent refusal of the Schizomycete to grow at all, in its sheathed
form, in the stiffened media.
~ At length I obtained some very puzzling results, shown in figs. 1-4, Plate 14.
When first observed, I supposed that this was a pathological phenomenon ; but it
has now been followed so often and so closely, that my explanation of it may probably
be accepted as the true one.

In the cases referred to, the rod-like Schizomycete either escapes altogether from
its gelatinous investment (fig. 2, Plate 14); or, more frequently, it does so partially
