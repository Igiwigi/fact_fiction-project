gplot 4-1, with superphosphate of lime alone, where there was still less of growth, and
Econsequently still less of active competition.
65 An examination of the lines of total Graminew, total Leguminose, and total Mis-
Scellanez, will show that, in the second separation-year, that is after the effects of the
Echange had become thoroughly established, there was a diminution, both in the per-
Scentage and in the yield per acre, of the grasses, a very great diminution, both in
percentage and yield, of the leguminous herbage, and a greater increase in those of the
miscellaneous herbage. But it will be remembered that the second separation-year
was one pre-eminently favourable to a relative excess of the miscellaneous species ;
still, in the third and fourth separation-years, there was also a higher percentage
proportion, and amount, of snch herbage than in the first. There was at the same time
a continued diminution in both the percentage and actual amount of the leguminous
herbage ; in fact, only about one-sixth as much was grown in the fourth as in the first
separation-year. The total yield of the Graminew also diminished very much from the
first to the third, but increased again considerably in the fourth separation-year. The
fluctuations according to seagon were, indeed, very considerable. Still, especially as
