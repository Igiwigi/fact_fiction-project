'T'xx determination of the figure and magnitude of the earth
has at all times excited the curiosity of mankind, and the his-
tory of the geveral attempts made by astronomers to solve
this-problem might be traced to the most remote antiquity.
But the details of the methods pursued by the ancients on this
subject being extremely vague, and their results expressed in
meagures of which we do not know the relation to our own,
in fact give us very little assistance in learning either the
figure or dimensions of our globe.

It was not till the revival of science in Europe that the
two great philosophers, HuyGnEens and Newton, first en-
gaged-in the consideration of this question, and reduced to
the known laws of mechanics, the principles on which the
figure of the earth should be determined.

They demonstrated that the rotatory motion should occa-
sion differences in the force of gravity-in different latitudes,
and consequently that parts of the earth in the neghbourhood
of the equator $hould' be more elevated than those near'the
