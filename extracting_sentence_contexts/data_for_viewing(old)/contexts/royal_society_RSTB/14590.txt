and treat language as a source of embodiment.

In this essay, I have critically examined the linguistic
embodiment hypothesis on its own. This hypothesis gener-
ates several promising predictions that enjoy a degree of
empirical support: namely, that iconicity should make impor-
tant contributions to concept acquisition and use, that the
presence of a label should influence how we conceptualize

a category, that some conceptual content should be encoded
in the relations of words to other words, and that inner
speech should help us resolve uncertainty about our con-
cepts. Further support is provided by the fact that abstract
concepts and inferential tasks elicit greater activation in the
language system than concrete concepts and _ referential
tasks, respectively.
