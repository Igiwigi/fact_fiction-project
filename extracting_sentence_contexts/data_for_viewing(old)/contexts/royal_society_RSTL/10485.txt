by a pipette and allowing the vapour to diffuse, the mixture was rendered explosive.

* Four of these tubes were exhibited before the Chemical Section of the British Association at Swansea
in 1880. When tested with sparks from a Leyden-jar no action was obseryed; with a discharge from the
coil the wires became red-hot, but the gases did not explode.

I gratefully acknowledge the valuable help given me by Mr. S. KE. Mrs, laboratory assistant at
Chris Church, in charging these tubes.


IN GASES: HYDROGEN, CARBONIC OXIDE, AND OXYGEN. 633

Dr. B6rson* in a dissertation read at Tubingen has denied the fact (briefly
announced by me in 1880) that the absence of steam prevents the combination of
carbonie oxide and oxygen by the spark. He states that he has repeated the experi-
ment, and the mixture exploded, © eyen when dried by phosphoric oxide.” He found
that by sufficiently reducing the pressure he could prevent the propagation of the
explosion, both in the wet and dry gases. He snggests as an explanation of my regults
that the dry gases were tested under a less pressure than the wet gases. From the
detailed account I have given above, it is evident that Dr. Borson's explanation does
not account for the facts observed. I conclude that he failed to obtain the same result
by nob leaving the mixture long enough in contact with dry phosphoric oxide. I may
add that during the last two years, several of my pupils have repeated the experiment
in the Balliol College laboratory, so that the fact of the non-inflammability of the dry
gases when submitted to an electric spark under ordinary pressure and temperature,
