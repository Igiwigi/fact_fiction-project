We note that when both fil-
which TP (fuzzy cactus, fuzzy penguin), a look-up table with lers and roles are similar to each other, both models predict
that information or simply the knowledge of the modeller the same thing—maximal similarity as identity is
looking at the values in the network). Another consequence approached. The key prediction regards cases where the fil-
of a TP-based architecture without a tracking mechanism is lers and roles are not a priori similar to each other; TP
that binding information (viz., the fact that fuzzy penguin predicts these have (cosine) similarity of zero, ADB predicts

for the system to maintain variable-value independence—
for the system to be functionally symbolic, and for the

By contrast, in a binding system that maintains role—filler
independence, the similarity of x to itself is fixed, regardless (a) Participants
of what it is bound to.
