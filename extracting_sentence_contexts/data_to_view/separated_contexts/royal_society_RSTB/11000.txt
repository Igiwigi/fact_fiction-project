Introduction

HSP60/GroEL heat shock proteins (HSPs) have been studied for many years

and HSP110 HSP/chaperone protein families have been found to be ‘moon-
lighting proteins’. Moonlighting proteins comprise a subset of multifunctional
proteins in which one polypeptide chain exhibits more than one physiologically
relevant biochemical or biophysical function [1]. In this class of multifunctional
proteins, the multiple functions are not due to gene fusions or multiple proteo-
lytic fragments.
