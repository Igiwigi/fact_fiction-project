Sometimes they are small, numerous, and scattered without any definite arrangement
over the entire surface of the wall of the chamber, whilst in other cases they are con-
siderably larger, and form single, double, or eyen triple rows between the septal bands
(Plate V. fig. 10). Another remarkable variety of external aspect is produced by the
elevation of the general surface into rounded eminences closely abutting on one another
(like the pustules of the skin in a case of confluent small-pox), and distinguished from
the preceding by the absence of any peculiarity in the texture of the shell. That these
and other analogous variations of surface-marking have no value as differential characters,
is at once demonstrated, not merely by their gradational approximation in different indi-
viduals, but by the fact that they are presented in very different degrees on different
parts of the surface of the very same shell ; the chambers of one part of the spire being
strongly marked by certain of these peculiarities, whilst those of another may only
present indications of them, and those of a third may be perfectly smooth. 148. The collection of Mr. CuxinG, however, contains a group of forms which are at
once distinguished from the rest by their general physiognomy (Plate III. figs.
