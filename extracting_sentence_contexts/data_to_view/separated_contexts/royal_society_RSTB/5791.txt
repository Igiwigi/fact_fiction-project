INTRODUCTION. The literature of reptilian colour change extends over twenty three centuries, and
yet our knowledge of the physiological processes which govern it, and of the environ-
mental factors which bring it about, is to-day far less complete than for the other two
groups of vertebrates which possess pigmentary effectors. The cause of this, it would
seem, resides in the fact that the colour changing reptiles inhabit pre-eminently the
tropical and subtropical regions of the globe, and are not readily available for physio-
logical investigation in the main centres of scientific progress. The history of this
subject is peculiar. From Aristotle to the end of the nineteenth century the literature
deals almost exclusively with the chameleon, an animal which for centuries has excited
the curiosity of travellers in North Africa, and which, in consequence, has acquired
a popular reputation that is quite remarkable.
