Further, the recognition of superficial
cells as archesporial, draws a distinction between part of the sporangial wall which
originates from them, and the rest which does not; thus in the Leptosporangiate
Ferns, the apical part of the annulus would be archesporial, the lateral parts not. With all respect for the opinion of the writer who introduced the term, I think
that this last change in its application, as suggested by Wiison Smiru, and accepted
by Gorse, makes more obscure the meaning of a word which has never been clear. The Bryophyta provide a reductio ad absurdum of the method of “a last analysis,”

for following this method in Sphagnum and some others, the amphithecium would be
reckoned as the archesporium, while in the ordinary Bryinese it would be the
endothecium ; or carrying the analysis in the latter case to its extreme limit, the first
segments in the upper half of the zygote, or even the ovum itself, would be the
archesporium,

The fact is that this sort of analysis of formative tissues has served its turn ; it
has led to much detailed investigation, and elicited facts, as regards segmentation,
a knowledge of which is of value for comparison, But it has also shown that the
segmentations which lead up to the formation of spore-mother-cells are not comparable
in all cases. The time has come, in presence of so many divergent details, to frankly
admit that there is no general law of segmentation underlying the existence of that
cell, ov cells, which “ a last analysis” may mark out as the “ archesporium,” and that,
therefore, the general application of such a term to those cells which the analysis
discloses, has no scientifie meaning, beyond the statement of the histiogenie fact. *
