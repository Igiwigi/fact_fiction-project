shell middle surface, it is demonstrated that, for the spherical shell buckling problems of interest
in this paper, the moderate rotation theory provides an accurate description of the buckling
response for pole deflections as large as AWpole = 0.2R, assuming that the shell is thin enough
such that the strains remain small. Solutions to the equations of moderate rotation theory depend
on two dimensionless parameters, R/t and v, and these parameters must be specified to generate
any solution. However, moderate rotation theory reduces to shallow shell theory near the poles.
Thus, when the buckling deflections are localized at the poles, shallow shell theory pertains. The
significance of this for present purposes is that the equations of shallow shell theory for spherical
shell buckling can be cast in a dimensionless form which is independent of R/t and v with the
dependence on these parameters absorbed into the solution variables. This feature will allow us
to present complete results for all R/t and v. The range of applicability of the results is limited
to sufficiently large R/t, as will be made clear. The equations of shallow shell theory make use
of the fact that the slopes of the shell are shallow relative to a base plane lying below the region
near the pole where the buckling deflections occur. These equations are not listed here but they
can be found in [10,11] and the dimensionless form referred to above for spherical shells appears
in [12,13].
