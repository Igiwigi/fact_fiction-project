But I have also
heard it remarked by sea officers, as long ago as I can re-
member, that © it was unaccountable, what should occasion
« their running down $0 much distance, in coming in with the
« Jand, from the westward.” I never heard, however, that
there was any suspicion of a current, setting to the westward. The idea of a northern indraught into St. George's Channel,
(but which applies equally to the current west of Scilly) is
clearly set forth, in a publication by Captain Joszen MEa, in
1757; but which only came to my knowledge very lately,
by the favour of Mr. Purpy ; to whom I stand indebted, also,
for the knowledge of the important fact of the get of forty-six
miles, during the calm, in the Chops of the Channel. Captain Mxap first relates the case of the ship Hope of
Liverpool, bound from the coast of Guinea, to that port, in
November 1735. (Preface, page ili.)
