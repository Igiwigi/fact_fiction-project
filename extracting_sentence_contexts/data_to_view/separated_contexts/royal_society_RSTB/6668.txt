All developed a large flat cartilage which was entire wing bud was included in
obviously part of the sternal plate, and which was well explant O. The line cd marks the

transverse boundaryin the lateral
separated from the other skeletal structures, one- to two- body wall (beneath the wing
thirds of the coracoid, a humerus and part of the radius bud) between explants N and O.
and ulna. In no. 2, explant N, probably owing to experimental damage, formed no cartilage
in spite of the fact that one-third of the coracoid was missing from explant O, but in
the other three pairs explant N almost perfectly complemented explant O. Thus all
the explants of region N in these pairs developed two nodules of cartilage: one broad
and plate-like representing the anterior part of the sternal plate, which was associated
with a second, oval or elongated nodule representing the ventral end of the coracoid,
while the explants of region O, in addition to part of the wing skeleton, developed the
dorsal portion of the coracoid and a fragment of the posterior half of the sternal plate. The experiments of groups 3 and 4 showed that the lateral body wall below the
anterior part of the wing bud contains no presumptive sternal tissue for a distance of
1 and possibly 2 somites behind the anterior margin of the bud.
