(h) F(R)-cosmology

A rather different modification of the basic dynamical form of general relativity than the Brans— :2
Dicke or more generally the scalar-tensor theories—higher-order gravity—appeared very early : S
and continues in new forms until today, having major ties with early universe cosmology. Based : Ss
on earlier impressive and original work of Lanczos (cf. [68,69] and references therein) and others : =
on the influence of higher-order invariants of the Riemann tensor on the structure of general :g
relativity, a particular choice eventually seemed simple and general enough: the gravitational [3
Lagrangian be an arbitrary analytic function of the scalar curvature, f(R). In fact, this leads under : S
a metric variation to fourth-order field equations, not second order-like general relativity (while : Ss
other types of variation may lead to second-order ones, see below). The result is a new theory of : =I

gravitation, f(R)-gravity. Keeping f(R) analytic means that this type of theory will be expected to play a significant role in
the extreme conditions of the early universe where higher-powers of the scalar curvature become
important, but not for late-time evolution (where such powers become negligible). f(R)-gravity
is hence expected to convey some of the importance of the influence of quantum gravitational
effects in the early universe even though everything is classical.
