present, should have resulted in the adoption of the conception of a continuous
spireme, but we now know from the observations of many investigators that in
organisms with free pairs of chromosomes their ends are separate from the earliest
prophase stages, and all critical workers are apparently agreed on this point.
In those Oenotheras with complete catenation the spireme is, on the contrary, not
only continuous but also devoid of free ends. The catenated chromosomes of
Oenothera are linked up end-to-end from the earliest stages of meiosis, whereas free
pairs are free from the earliest stages. This applies equally when both types of
arrangement are found, as they are in many biotypes, in the same cell.

Daruinctonâ€™s idea that chiasmata are necessary to produce meiotic pairing is
disproved not only by the facts already cited in Oenothera but by various other lines
of evidence, only one of which need be mentioned here. A number of cases of
secondary pairing of chromosomes, both in heterotypic and homotypic mitosis,
shows that this must be due to a residual attraction between similar elements and is
entirely independent of chiasma formation. Generally, this secondary pairing
does not express itself at all in diakinesis, at a time when the bivalents all repel each
other owing to a superficial charge. Later, in both first and second metaphase,
when these widely sundered bivalents lose their repulsion the mutual specific
attractions express themselves. There is also evidence of attraction between the
halves of the bivalent chromosomes, quite apart from any chiasmata which may
occur. Absence of pairing cannot, therefore, be taken as proof of failure of chiasmata
or of their complete terminalization either in Oenothera, where this argument has
frequently been used, or in any other genus.
