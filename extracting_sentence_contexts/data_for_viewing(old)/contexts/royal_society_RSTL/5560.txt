gives the axis of &, or if cos 0= 3D which gives y=+ — for the tangents parallel

to the axis of x.

The coefficient of y vanishes if cos 20— cos /=0; this gives
cos f=LEv SCH, 8In 0=:(4— 1FVS2FT).

and the tangents perpendicular to the axis of z are given by

= L+.4 86h,
these tangents are in fact double tangents of the caustic. In order that the point of
contact may be real, it is necessary that sin 0, cos 0 should be real; this will be the case
for both values of the ambiguous sign if «> or =1, but only for the upper value if @<1.
It has just been shown that for the tangents parallel to the axis of &, we have
