Note here the absence of the exponentially growing term in the above bound as compared to eal
inequality (4.8). This is due to the fact that terms Sr, Sr Anquld%al w dx, || + 21 < 6, are positive eae
and no longer treated as error terms. By absorbing the small multiple of E(t) into the left-hand a]
side, and using the positivity of dq; from step 2, we obtain that DN
