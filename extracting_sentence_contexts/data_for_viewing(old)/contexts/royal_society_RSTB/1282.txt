etes the trabeculee are not uncommonly connected either by their branchlets

ed state of the sporangium, which, however, has not been found in any of
ts hitherto considered. The advantages of a partitioned condition, where
rangium is large, are plain enough ; not only would the nutritive surface

From Isoetes, suggest the question whether such partitioned sporangia of the
adinous type occur, and, if so, in what plants ¢

riking answer to this question is, T believe, to be found in a genus of
3 dineous affinity, in which the sporangium is extended in the radial direction.
ave already noted fluctuations in this dimension within the genus Lycopodium

ly sterilized to form the trabeculz, is a still more pronounced example among
ants. As will now be explained at length, it is in Tmesipteris that we
to find a comparatively simple septate sporangium, or synangium—which, on
round of the above considerations, appears to be a more efficient type of
ction than such trabecular sporangia as are seen in Jsoetes or Lepidodendron.
