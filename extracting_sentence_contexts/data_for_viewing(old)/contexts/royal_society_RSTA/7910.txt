6C at Cambridge = 0-5054461, — 0-146 x 10° 7D after 10 January, 1934)
Combining this with (4) and (6) above, we have,
6C-Base at Cambridge
= — 7866-2 + 0-135D before 10 January, 1934 |
= — 7851-6 — 0-011D after 10 January, 1934

Mean of 6A and 6C-Base at Cambridge
— — 7876-9 + 0-135D before 10 January, 1934 |
= — 7869-6 + 0:062D after 10 January, 1934

These expressions were adopted throughout* and the values in col. 21 of Table 1V
have been obtained from them. It is not supposed that the change in 6C took place
exactly in the manner assumed; in fact there is some evidence from fig. 4 that all
the change occurred between January and April, 1934; the assumed form of the
variation is, however, probably as near the truth as any other simple assumption.
The change is not large ; if it had been neglected altogether and the simple mean
of the initial and final observations used throughout the adopted value of g would
at no station be changed by more than 0-002 cm/sec?.

2.6. Repeat Stations—It will be seen from Table IV that several stations were
visited more than once. The results obtained are collected in Table VII. At
Nairobi it was not possible to observe again at the point used on the first visit, and
on the second and third visits the observations were made at a point 850 m away,
and 26 m lower. The two values given for the first visit are the observed value
reduced to the value which would have been obtained at the second station, first,
