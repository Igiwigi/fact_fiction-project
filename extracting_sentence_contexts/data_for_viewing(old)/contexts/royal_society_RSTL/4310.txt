the difference between the readings on long and on short grass becomes less in geo-
metrical progression with a common ratio of one-half; till attaining a reading of 30*
the difference equals the fourth term of the series, and this difference continues
very nearly constant till 60, above which temperature I have had but few expe-
riments. If we call the excess of air-temperature above that of long grass tempera-
ture by e, then the excess of the readings on short grass above those on long grass at

0?, 10”, 20* and at 30*, and above 309, will be respectively e, 1 e, or (3): and
for any intermediate reading the difference can be easily calculated from these terms.
The very singular and unexpected facts now detailed, merit attention and suggest the
necessity of carefully noting the position of a thermometer in any investigation in which
such instrument is needed, as indeed do all the experiments that I have made, though
not in 80 marked a manner as does this. I now proceed to the results of those expe-
riments in which grass was coyered by different substances, which are as follows :—
