50. It is extremely difficult to obtain a simple law y
of attraction, even an approximate one, of such a mass
as that under consideration. I have, however, arrived
at one which appears to represent the facts with a con-
siderable degree of exactness, and by which we can
interpolate for the amount of deflection at any station
of the arc intervening between Kaliana and Damargida. It depends upon the properties of the curve of which

the equation is w=S i, Let Az, Ay be the axes of \

a?
x and y, and Qaq be the curve; the axis of y is an \
asymptote, and the curve cuts the axis of z at right , bY "nd
angles at a distance Aa=a. The property of this |
curve which I am about to use is as follows. The /
attraction upon A of any slender prism of matter Qg, /
parallel to the axis of y and terminated at both ends i
by the curve, is the same as if the mass of the prism
were concentrated in the point a.
