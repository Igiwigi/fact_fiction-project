It is noticeable that after the first tenth of a second the curves
taken under similar conditions, but for various sizes of explosive, lie closely together,
showing that the diameter has no material effect on the subsequent rate of cooling. When we refer, however, to the table, we see that the times required to reach a
given fraction of the maximum are different for different diameters. This apparent discrepancy is explained by the fact that the total quantity of heat
absorbed is primordially a function of time. When the combustion is very rapid, the
maximum pressure is reached while the walls of the enclosure are still cold and the
percentage fall of pressure per unit time is high. With a slow-burning cordite the
surface of the enclosure becomes considerably heated during the combustion of the
explosive, and after the maximum the percentage fall of pressure is correspondingly
lower.
