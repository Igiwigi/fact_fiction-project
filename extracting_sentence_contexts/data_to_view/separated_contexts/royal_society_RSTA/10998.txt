The slip-bands appear as they would have done
had the specimen never been strained before. The general features are much the
same as in annealed metal, but they show on the whole a greater tendency towards
sudden steps and branches. This difference in the character of the slips may be
connected with the well-known fact that such strained material is considerably harder,
in the sense of having a higher yield-point and less capability of plastic deformation
than it shows in the virgin or annealed state, and also with our own observation that
the slip-bands are much more straight and regular in very plastic metals, such as lead,
gold, and copper, than in harder metals like iron and nickel. The mere fact that
finite slips occur at intervals throughout the grain implies that it is easier for sliding
to take place over certain surfaces than it is over others. The surface on which

* uniform slip occurs is not necessarily plane; it may be the trace of a straight line
moving parallel to itself; a line which is in the direction of slip and always lies
parallel to one of the cleavage planes.
