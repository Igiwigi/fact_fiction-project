During one vacation in Antrim, Humphry
recalled a walk from Port Ballintrae to Portrush to attend a picnic. Stokes, however, was eager to
carry out some experiments ‘on waves in a cave near Portrush’. After wading out, he ‘worked
away at his waves, so that we waited rather long, and the tide was quite high when we set
off back’, an anecdote Humphry recounts fondly despite the fact that it led to them missing
the picnic’. It is through Humphry’s recounting of her childhood memories with her father
that we see how the sea continued to play an important role in Stokes’ life: he was ‘fond of
walking on the Velvet Strand’ when they would stay with his sister Elizabeth in Malahide. Many long vacations were spent at the Observatory at Armagh, Elizabeth Haughton’s homeplace, : =
and Humphrey recalls visiting ‘some seaside place, oftenest the magnificent neighbourhood of : =
the Giant’s Causeway’.
