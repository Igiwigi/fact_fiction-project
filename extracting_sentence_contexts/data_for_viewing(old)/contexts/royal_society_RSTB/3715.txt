staining is not suitable for their clear differentiation.

The interspaces between the various diverticula of the paraphysis are filled with
slightly fibrous connective tissue containing numerous elongated nuclei;,and thin-
walled blood-vessels (figs. 72, 75, 76).

That the paraphysis is glandular in function there can, I think, be no doubt, and
its anatomical relations suggest that it probably plays an important part in the


256 PROF. A. DENDY ON THE STRUCTURE, ETC. OF THE PINEAL ORGANS AND

secretion of the cerebro-spinal fluid. The fact that it was interpreted as a vestigial
sense-organ by its original discoverer, SELENKA (1890), and compared with the
auditory organ of Ascidians, as the ‘“ Epiphysis” had previously been compared
with the Ascidian eye, simply illustrates the danger of theorising upon an insufficient
basis of fact, and the manner in which one erroneous comparison leads to another.

Morphologically, as I have more than once pointed out, the paraphysis is to be
regarded merely as part of the same system of folds of the non-nervous portion of the
brain-roof as gives rise to the choroid plexuses of the third and lateral ventricles.
