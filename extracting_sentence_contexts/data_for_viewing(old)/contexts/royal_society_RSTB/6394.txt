from the beginning of May to mid-June ; and (b) captures from mid-June to the
end of October. It will be seen that the results support the hypothesis, as the May
curve shows higher catches at “last quarter ’’ and lower at “ first quarter ’’ while
the later curve shows the reverse. The only inexplicable feature at the moment
is the very low captures about four or five days before full moon in the May-June
curve; but as this is based on a relatively small number of figures it may be accidental.
The original asymmetry of the curve in fig. 2 is therefore only due to the fact
that it was based on a larger number of observations after mid-June than before.

Effect of the Phase of the Moon on the Time of Flight of the Noctuidae

Table VII and fig. 5 (histogram) show the normal distribution of the Noctuidae
through the eight equal periods of the night into which the trap separates the
catches. This is based on all captures in the summers of 1933, 1934, and 1935. It
will be seen that the maximum flight is just after midnight in period 5, if calculated
on either anumber or logarithmic basis, but that almost equal numbers come before
and after midnight (47% to 53%).

If the moon is inhibiting activity it would be expected that the catch in the early
