> abundant on the reefs in from one to two feet of water, and is very conspicuous because

> 1 failed in an attempt to procure the animals of this species in an expanded condi-

S tion; but my colleague, Mr. J. MuRRar, succeeded on two occasions, and on the second
ZE occasion showed me the expanded zooids, and handed the living specimens over to me
for examination. I am greatly indebted to Mr. Murray for having thus afforded me
£ the opportunity of studying the zooids of Millepora in the expanded condition, and I
SZ do not think that I should ever have succeeded in arriving at a satisfactory knowledge
S of their structure without this aid. Mr. Murray further, who had had better oppor-
tunities of observing the living coral than I, first drew my attention to the fact that the
S central zooid of each system had a mouth. No species of Millepora appears hitherto
to have been known to occur on the reefs of the Society Islands. In DaxAa's work on
Corals* no Millepora is mentioned as occurring at Tahiti, and this locality is not given
for any species of Millepora by MM. Epwarps and Haig. It is impossible to determine
with any certainty the species of such a form as Millepora without access to museum
collections. The Tahitian species, of which the structure is here described, resembles
closely in form M. tuberculoss (M. gonagra) figured by MM. Epwarvs and Haimef.
Like this species it never forms foliaceous expansions, but is tuberculate and irregular
