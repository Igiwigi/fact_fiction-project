A typical sequence of photographs is shown in figure 11.

In this sequence (i.e. figure 11), the test block is placed between two circular polarizers, which
caused colour fringes to appear. Each colour fringe represents a constant difference between the
principal stresses in a plane normal to the optical axis of the camera. The black fringe in frame

represents a region in the glass block where the compressive stress changes to tensile stress.
A 2mm diameter tungsten carbide sphere impacts the tempered glass block at 150ms~! and the
contact between the sphere and the glass surface occurs in frame 3, which results in the generation
of splinter cracks (see frame 4). Between frames 4 and 5, the velocity of the splinter cracks is
500 ms~!. Moreover, the splinter cracks enter the tension zone between frames 4 and 5. This
leads to the initiation of the catastrophic failure of the glass, with the process of fracture being
propagated and controlled by the tensile stress present in the glass. In fact, from frame 5 to 12 the
fracture spreads almost throughout the glass block, showing repeated crack bifurcation. Note that
this crack propagation behaviour is quite different from the particle-impact-generated fracture
behaviour in stress-free blocks of soda-lime glass.

5. Discussion

In this work, several aspects of dynamic crack initiation and propagation in inorganic glasses
due to small-particle impact have been examined experimentally using high-speed framing
photography. We shall discuss below each of these aspects separately.

First, we consider the results from the 1 mm diameter steel spheresâ€™ impact on various glasses.
It was found that in all glasses examined, except the B2O03, Hertzian cone cracks formed for
