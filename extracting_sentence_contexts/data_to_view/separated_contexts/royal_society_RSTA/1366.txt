Another test applicable to the multiple base

* When a surface is represented on a plane, any point of the plane which corresponds to a line of the
surface is called a “ fundamental ” point of the plane.

} In fact the tangent cone to a ‘Y-primal at a point P of a base curve k will be composed of planes through
the tangent to k at P; so that all the points of the neighbourhood of P which lie in one of these planes
through the tangent will impose the same condition on V’-primals to contain them and will be represented
by the same point P’ of 8. Corresponding to the «2 planes through the tangent, then, we get » * points
forming an E-surface of S. Cf. Berrrt as quoted already.
