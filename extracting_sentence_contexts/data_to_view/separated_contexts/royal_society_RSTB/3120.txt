There are, however, two points concerning the young nucleolus to which attention
may be directed. The first point concerns its position. In the resting oogonium the
nucleolus appears to be always peripheral in position, whereas in the actively growing
oocyte it is for some time invariably central, a fact which scarcely points to the peri-
pheral position of the nucleolus as denoting a cytoplasmic origin for this structure. *

* MontTGoMERY, 1898 (p. 523), after giving several instances of young nucleoli showing an invariably

peripheral position, concludes that “the nucleolar substance in many, if not in all, cases has an
extranuclear origin.” é
