A proof is given in the Appendix. One should not conclude from this proposition that non-discrete groups are not interesting! In
fact, it is a main purpose of this paper to highlight their usefulness (ยง4). These results underlie extremely simple methods of constructing objective molecular
structures, which we call the group theory method. Numerous examples are given below.
