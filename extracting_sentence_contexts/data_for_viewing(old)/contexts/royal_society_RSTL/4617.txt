mosses of the present day. Had the plants in both cases been the same, I see no
reason for doubting that when distilled they would have yielded identical bases.

Formation of Organic Bases from the nitrogenous Principles of Vegetables and Animals
otherwise than by destructive Distillation.

1. By treating them with alkaline lyes. â€”From the facts which haye been previously
stated, I think we are warranted to conclude, that when ammonia is produced in
large quantities by the destructive distillation of either vegetable or animal s8ub-
stances, it is always accompanied by the formation of organic bases. Now as am-
monia is known to be procurable from these substances by several other methods, it
seemed by no means improbable that on these occasions organic bases would also be
produced. It has long been known that ammonia is largely generated when the
nitrogenous portions of either plants or animals are boiled with strong alkaline lyes.
A quantity of beans was therefore introduced into the body of a large still, and was
boiled with a strong s0lation of caustic soda. The beans were speedily disintegrated,
being converted into a slimy, dark-coloured pulp. The greatest difficulty attending
the operation was caused by the frothing up of the pasty mixture, which, unless the
$till was very capacious and the fire kept moderate, was very apt to boil over and
