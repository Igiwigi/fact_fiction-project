I have done this,
making the mean square value of (correct-actual) least, treating first all observations
as of equal value, and secondly as weighted according to R. and P.’s estimates, In
both cases the result is the same, viz., k = 1000033. If, as might possibly seem
preferable, the ratio of difference to wave-length is to be a minimum, then
k& = 1:000030. On these suppositions we obtain the following corrections to apply to
R. and P.’s lines to bring them into their true positions on their scale :—

I I. |

dX. dn. an. dn. |
— +045 +°072 ~ +068 +128
+ +003 — +006 — +020 +044
— +049 +°147 — 069 4207
4-115 ~ +460 4100 ~ +400
— +002 + +008 —-019 +076
+049 = 245 +033 = +165

- 015 +°075 — 030 | +°150

The List I.—actual errors a minimum—appears the better, in view of the fact that
some of the corrections are within R. and P.’s estimates, and that they are generally
smaller than in II. It would, perhaps, have been advisable to use these corrected
values in determining N by least squares, but the work had been done before
