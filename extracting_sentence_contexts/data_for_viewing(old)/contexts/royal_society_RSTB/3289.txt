The occurrence in mammals of drowsiness, ataxia, and impairment of the reflexes
indicates that the venom lowers the functional activity of the brain and spinal cord.
‘In the frog, apart from experiments specially performed for the purpose of locating
the site of the paralysis, the symptoms observed in the course of experiments made
to determine the minimum-lethal dose give some indications of the nature of the
paralysis. Thus, with doses near the minimum-lethal dose, generally on the second
or third day after administration, while respiration is paralysed, the conjunctival
reflex inactive or absent, and motor power greatly weakened, vigorous and sustained
kicking movements still follow strong mechanical or electrical stimulation of the skin
of the leg. The probability, therefore, is that in the earlier stages of poisoning with
these doses, the impairment of motility is due to a central paresis rather than to
a paresis of the motor nerve-ends. That there is, however, later in the poisoning
a paralysing action on the motor nerves is clear from the fact that, during the paretic
stage and a day or more before failure of the circulation, contraction of the
gastrocnemius muscle cannot be elicited by faradie stimulation of its sciatic nerve,
whereas the muscle when stimulated directly reacts to a strength of stimulus which
is not much above the minimal for an unpoisoned muscle.

That this venom has a paralysing action on the central nervous system is rendered
more evident in the case of large doses, as is seen in the following experiment.

Experiment 24.—A male frog (2. temp.), weighing 20 grammes, received by
subcutaneous injection 0°0004 gramme of venom, equivalent to 0°02 gramme per
kilogramme. Five hours after injection the respirations were completely arrested,
the conjunctival reflex was inelicitable, and no reflex movements ensued on strong
