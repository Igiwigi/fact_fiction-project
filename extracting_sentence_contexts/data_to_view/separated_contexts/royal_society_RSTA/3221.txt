In principle, we expect that it should be verified during DA
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) era. One might question whether that test has essentially been Dw
already carried out now, with a negative conclusion, hence the title of this contribution. Here, :
we will present one class of examples to the contrary, but in fact there are also others that have :3
been discussed at this meeting [3]. The model we focus upon is based upon a two-step phase :3
transition in which a singlet field first condenses, before making a strongly first-order transition :
to the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) vacuum. It is also possible to get a strong EWSB
transition using a second field that transforms non-trivially under the standard model SU(2),,
gauge symmetry [4-6].
