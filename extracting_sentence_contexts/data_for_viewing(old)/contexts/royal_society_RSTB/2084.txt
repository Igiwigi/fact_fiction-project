the periphery of such preparations are frequently more widely open than those
in the centre—a fact which demonstrates the general untrustworthiness of the
method. The stomata can only be well seen in stripped epidermis or thin surface
sections, but such preparations are especially liable to the source of error above
indicated.

In spite of the difficulty of accurately observing the stomata in thick sections, and
in spite of the general objections to this class of work, there is no doubt that much
valuable work has been done in this way. It is, however, significant, as Srann has
pointed out, that Lerrars (86) and SCHELLENBERGER (97) working in this manner
have arrived at diametrically opposite results in determining the fundamental question
whether or no the majority of terrestrial plants close their stomata at night.*

A far better microscopic method is that employed by some of the old observers,
