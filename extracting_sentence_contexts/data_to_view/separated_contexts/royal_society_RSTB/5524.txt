and concluding that it develops from cortical areas. ‘To other minds, such a fact calls

for a more conservative interpretation—that since this tissue is not the result of a

primary neuronic emigration outward to form a real cortex and a secondary one inward,
: it could not be properly said to be a derivative of the cortex and therefore pallial in
origin. Further, the pyriform lobe is described as separated from the general pallium
by the fissura rhinalis and from secondary olfactory centres, medially or ventro-
medially, by a fissura endorhinalis which becomes the fissura amygdala when it separates
the pyriform from the nucleus amygdale. After such a definite delimitation it is
difficult to understand how the origin of that complex may be adequately described
as the result of an infolding along the fissura itself.
