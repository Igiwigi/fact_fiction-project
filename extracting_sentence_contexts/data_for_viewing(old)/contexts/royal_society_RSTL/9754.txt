ON THE SENSITIVE STATE OF VACUUM DISCHARGES. 629

gh the interval between two of the discharges considered in this paper may
exceed a thousandth part of a second, ib is not surprising that it should be
at of all proportion greater than the time actually occupied by the discharge. Ib is
it this fact that we owe the isolation of the individual discharges of the sensitive
rge, which has formed the basis of the present investigation : an isolation which
rs the examination of this type of discharge equivalent, as we have already men-
, to the examination of the electric spark itself.*
We need not examine the magnitude of the period occupied by the whole discharge.

tities with which we are dealing, and which are in reality the component parts of
