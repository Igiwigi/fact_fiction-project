To some extent this
concentration of carmine would be made up of particles moving forwards in the mid-gut
and which have not been trapped by the posterior portion of the organ, but it seems
certain that this could not account for such a conspicuous and dense concentration. It must be remembered that the wall of the oesophagus is ciliated and it is inevitable
that in a dense carmine suspension some material will be swept into the oesophagus
and along its walls without being collected into the main cord. This has, in fact, been
observed directly, by opening in the usual way an animal which had been for some
time in a carmine suspension; particles were streaming down the wall of the oesophagus,
and many of these were collecting in the anterior extension of the lateral ciliated
tract. It thus appears that this organ helps to collect and convey to the main food cord
material which passes down the oesophagus without being compacted into the cord. AMPHIOXUS (BRANCHIOSTO MA) LANCEOLATUS 299

A dense carmine suspension provides, of course, an excessively unnatural source of
material.
