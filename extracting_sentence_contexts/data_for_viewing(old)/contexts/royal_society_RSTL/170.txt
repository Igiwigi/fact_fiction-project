yet, as small rods of only an inch in diameter were placed on
those stations, when they were observed from Dundon Beacon
and Moor Lynch, and the same erected at the ends of the base,
when they were observed from those stations, it becomes pro-
bable that very trifling errors resulted from this proceeding.

The station at Ash Beacon was visited subsequent to these
just spoken of, and afterwards that on the Mendip Hills, for the
purpose of taking the angle between Moor Lynch and Dundon
Beacon. The operations of 1798 then terminated with a dili-
gent search after some spot in Cornwall, for a base of only two
or three miles in length : this search, however, was fruitless, as
in fact we had reason to imagine it would prove to be; but we
were not willing to relinquish the hope, that a piece of ground
might be discovered proper for so confined a purpose. "The
contrary, however, being the case, the party returned to London
in October.
