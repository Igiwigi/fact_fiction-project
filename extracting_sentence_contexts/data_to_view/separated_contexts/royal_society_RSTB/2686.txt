Penetration of haustoria into the epidermal cells took place after 18 hours, and
was at once followed by the vigorous growth of the first haustorium (which soon
became lobed by the development of finger-like processes), and the production of
hyphal branches from the appressorium of the germinating conidium. By about the

little groups of conidiophores with chains of ripe conidia were formed. These
persisted up to the tenth or eleventh day, sometimes becoming covered with little
powdery heaps of accumulated ripe conidia.
