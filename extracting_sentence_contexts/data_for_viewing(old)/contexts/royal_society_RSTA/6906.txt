Similar remarks apply to the general case of several indices 7,. The interlocking of
osculating systems of A and C determine the intermediate points of the canonical frame.

MINIMAL INDICES OF ROW DEPENDENCE

of points we can derive the minimal indices m; of row dependence for the singular

By transposing the matrix D to 1 and working with reflexions of primes instead

pencil. But it is interesting to derive them directly in terms of points as before; and this
is done by starting with the éo/a/ reflexion of D in either A or C.
In fact, let A, and C, be these total reflexions of D; and let C, be the reflexion of A

through B to C, so that A, > C,. Further, let
Cy = (Cas Ca) 1)

denote the space common to C, and C, when they overlap or coincide. When they have

no point common let C; — 0. It is convenient to denote this geometrical construction
