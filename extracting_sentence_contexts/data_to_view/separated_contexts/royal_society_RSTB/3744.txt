These turns are frequently con-
siderably wider than the enamel prisms and appear quite inconsistent with the
view that the tubes are within the prisms. In several places they can be seen
to project from the margin of the section (Plate 25, fig. 6, ¢) and their appearance
in this situation is highly suggestive of a very considerable amount of rigidity. I think the appearances in these sections are only consistent with the fact that they
are winding around the prisms in the interprismatic substance. The most marked peculiarity noticeable in marsupial tooth germs is, as pointed
out by Mr. Cartes Tomes, the great development of the Tomes’ processes of
the ameloblasts, and in the sections now under consideration they do not show the
dragging out seen in decalcified sections, where they are often reduced in many
places to a mere thread.
