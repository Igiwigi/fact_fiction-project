From this preparation it is clear that the black injection introduced into the “fine”
vessels has penetrated into Kepillary network of relatively capacious vessels, which is
entirely separate from the more minute terminal capillary branches of the veins (white). It may therefore safely be asserted that the “fine ’’ vessels do not pass into the
veins through a common capillary network as they should do were they functionally part
of the general arterial system. In fact, from a considerable number of injections both
single and double, I am confident that there is no direct connection between the “ fine ”
vessels and the veins, a conclusion to which I also came from the work I did on Lophius. Relations between the “ fine”? vessels and the blood vascular system: arteries.—As I
have already pointed out there is every reason to consider that the “ fine ” vessels are
