The subsomitic
mesoderm in Pieris corresponds with the ventral medial ccelom and the inner and
outer medial diverticula of Carausius, which gives rise to intrinsic and extrinsic muscles
of the leg and longitudinal muscles of the body wall. In the dorso-lateral portion of the ccelom of Carausius we have obviously the nearly
exact counterpart of the somitic portion of mesoderm in Pieris. Slight differences,
difficult to explain, lie in the different positions from which the fat body arises and the
fact that in Pieris there is no connection between visceral mesoderm and that which
gives rise to the ventral longitudinal muscles. Allowing, however, for the greater
development of coelomic space in Carausius than in Pieris there is substantial agree-
ment between the accounts given of the fate of the mesoderm in these two insects. In the fourth and fifth abdominal segments, at the stage shown in fig.
