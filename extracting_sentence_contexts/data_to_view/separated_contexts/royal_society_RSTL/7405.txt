Plate V. The two sets of lateral fibres (Plate V. diagram 10, z 7, vs) which assist
in the formation of the sphincter, intersect the angles formed by the crossing of the
anterior and posterior fibres, and render its aperture somewhat circular in appearance. This cireumstance, taken in connexion with the fact that the fibres pursue a yery
oblique direction, has given rise to the belief that the fibres of the sphineter and neck
of the bladder generally are circular fibres, which is not the case. The fibres of the
sphincter are best seen by inverting the bladder and dissecting from within, or by
making transverse sections of the prostatic portion of the urethra in the direction of the
fundus (Plate IV, figs. 19 & 20, m).
