Recently, this interpretation was
substantiated by phasing the diffraction patterns to show that these dynamics indeed arise from
a propagating demagnetization front launched at the interface [53]. Figure 2b shows additional measurements of the time dependent (2% 2% 2%) reflection,
measured at X-ray energies resonant (8.346 keV, blue data) and off-resonant (8.329 keV, green
data) with the Ni K-edge. The measured resonant diffraction intensity comprises a charge-order
contribution to the Bragg scattering (illustrated by the grey shaded region), which disappears
promptly and in fact before the lattice has completely rearranged. Figure 2c illustrates how
the lattice, magnetic and insulator-metal dynamics evolve as different types of order-disorder
fronts that propagate from the interface into the functional film at different speeds. Presumably,
charge order melting is the driving force of these dynamics, as its phase front advances ahead of
demagnetization and structural relaxation.
