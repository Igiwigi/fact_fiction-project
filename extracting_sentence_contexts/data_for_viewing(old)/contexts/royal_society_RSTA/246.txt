onwards, with first Fujitsu in the lead and then competition entering from many
Far Eastern companies. By 2004 normal economics reduced those interested to
Fujitsu-Hitachi, Pioneer, LG, Samsung and Panasonic, with the last two holding

wo-thirds of the market. In 2008 Panasonic claimed to have made the largest flat-
panel display in the world, with a 150 inch diagonal (Ashida et al. 2008). The PDP
market grew from 2000, as the lure of the CRT was fading, and the advantages
of the LCD had yet to become apparent. The superb performance of the panels
convinced many that the device had a promising future, but the manufacturing
problems were not common knowledge. In fact, it was a difficult device to make
in large quantity, and the cost of production was high. The emergence of rival
display effects persuaded Pioneer and Fujitsu to abandon plasma panels early in
2009, and the fact that the total market is reducing may well mean that plasma
panels will become a niche commodity.

iv) Flat cathode ray tubes

The engineering world had been very conscious in the mid-1900s of the
disadvantages of the CRT display, and it was not sitting idly by waiting for
an alternative to appear. The main problem was the cumbersome shape, which
was a great hindrance in moving to a larger screen size. The designers of a flat
replacement had to face at least two severe problems. The first was to arrange
the gun, itself quite long, within the depth of the tube, and then deflect the beam
through two right angles without losing focus. The activation of the phosphors
available at that time required almost 10kV, and the beam current needed for a
