A few simple experiments sufficed
to 8how that all the results obtained with gaseous jets may also be obtained with liquid
jets, and in a more marked and satisfactory way. As even the lightest known liquid has a very high density compared with air, we
should naturally not expect liquid jets to exhibit the same sensitiveness to gound that
gaseous jets do. Nor do they in fact ; while to purely mechanical disturbances they

are as sensitive, if not more 80. To produce powerful effects by sound on liquid
jets, it is therefore necessary to supply a lever, by means of which atrial sound-waves
may act on the orifice at greater mechanical adyantage.
