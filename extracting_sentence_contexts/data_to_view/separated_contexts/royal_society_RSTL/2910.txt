These facts distinctly prove that bees have a voluntary power of evolving heat,
while it seems only fair to conclude, on comparing the facts, that the quantity of heat
produced in a given time and space, has relation to the number of respirations per-
formed by the individual; and from the quantity of atmospheric air consumed, and of
carbonic acid gas evolved, that animal heat is greatly and perhaps almost entirely
dependent upon the chemical changes which take place in the air respired. Temperature of the Hive Bee, Apis mellifica, Linx., during the Winter. The many curious facts connected with the production of heat in the Humble Bee
and other insects, naturally disposed me to wish to extend my inquiries to the ascer-
tainment of that of the inhabitants of the hive, and fortunately circumstances enabled

me to carry my wishes into execution, and commence my observations in the summer
