«On the Conic of Five-pointic Contact,” in the Philosophical Transactions for 1859,
pp. 376, 377; and bearing in mind that in his formulz we must make A=1, p=0, y=0,
in order to institute a comparison ; and lastly, dividing throughout by (n—1)-*%#*9H?,
and multiplying by 2, the expression above written becomes
