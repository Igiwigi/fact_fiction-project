There is clearly an effect of vectors in the models described
here (contrast, for example, figures 3 and 4, rows (c) and (d))
and this effect is likely to have been underestimated because
of the limited variety of climate predictors available for both
vectors and disease. Among this limited set, temperature
seems to be more important in determining vector distri-
butions than dengue distribution on its own, and rainfall is
much more important for the disease on its own (i.e. in statis-
tical models without the vectors). This difference in
importance may help to explain why dengue models with
the mosquito vector layers gave different predictions from
those without (the usefulness of vector layers in the former
is confirmed by the fact that they are often selected as the
most important predictor variable). Nevertheless, a wider
range and type of predictor variable might highlight even
more the different climatic requirements of dengue and its vec-
tors, and therefore the difference between dengue models with
and without the mosquito distributions as predictor variables.
It could, of course, be claimed that both sorts of model are
intrinsically statistical and therefore that the dengue models
without the mosquito vectors will find some proxy among the
available climatic variables to replace the vector layers as
useful predictors. If this were the case, however, we might
expect the dengue models without vectors to select, as a
proxy for the vectors themselves, the same sorts of climate
