So notably is this the case that
all prepared sections show, as a rule, a distinct separation between these two callosal
segments, the inner as it were peeling away from the onterâ€”a natural condition due
to their opposed direction. It is therefore obvious, at a first glance, that these inner
regions of the brain which are similar and identical are connected by the same series
of fibres, and the same may readily be maintained for the outer regions of the hemi-
spheres. In fact, the regular superposition of fibres above one another, and the great
uniformity of their course in either hemisphere, conclusively show that they unite
identical regions of both sides. The most inferior fibres of the callosal commissure are
