The main
insulation difficulty is caused by spidersâ€™ webs. They insulate almost perfectly in dry
weather and are thus liable to escape detection. With the onset of damper conditions
not only does the insulation become poor, but the damp thread may probably be
bridging two different metals, the whole system constituting in fact a voltaic cell, and
the result is a rapid creep of the electrometer bubble making observations impossible. It is necessary to record the displacements of the electrometer under considerable
magnification. In order to obtain a sharp image, the top of the capillary tube is
ground flat and a strip of thin glass is cemented on to it with Canada balsam.
