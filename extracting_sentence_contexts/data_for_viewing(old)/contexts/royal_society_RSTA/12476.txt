According to Sir Wiit1Am THomson™ a wire which has been kept vibrating
torsionally for several hours or days through a certain range comes to rest much more
quickly when left to itself than when set in vibration after it has been at rest for
several days, and then immediately left to itself. This increase of dissipation of
energy due to repeated vibrations has been shown by the author not to occur provided
the vibrations are kept within sufficiently narrow limits ;+ but, on the contrary, the
effect of the vibrations is in this case to reduce the dissipation of energy. “Fatigue
of elasticity,” in fact, arises from upsetting molecular “ accommodation,” and occurs
“1 whenever the molecules are disturbed beyond a very small limit, whatever be the cause
of the disturbance. Thus, as has been pointed out,t the logarithmic decrement of a
torsionally oscillating iron wire is subpermanently increased by oscillating it beyond a
certain limit, by a very slight mechanical shock, a small rise or fall in temperature, or
a slight rotation of the molecules by magnetic stress. The following experiments
show that in a magnetic cycle we have exactly the same kind of effect produced by
the above-mentioned causes.

Experiment X.

3 A well-annealed iron rod which had previously been accommodated by repeated
cycles, followed by rest, was given a slight tap with a hammer. ‘The result is given
