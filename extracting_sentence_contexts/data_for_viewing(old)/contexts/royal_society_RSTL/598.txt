the air, = 447, in which the instrument was cooled,) it will
turn out, 8 minutes and 55 seconds after 11* go min. The ob-
served time was 11> gg minutes; which differs from the com-
puted time no more than 5 seconds.

If it were strictly true, as a very great philosopher and mathe-
matician has advanced, that the velocity with which a hot body
exposed to cool in a cold fluid medium parts with its heat, is as
the difference of the temperatures of the body and of the me-
dium, it is most certain, that the curve PQ could be no other
than the logarithmic curve. Perhaps it may be s0 in fact, and
that the variations from it which my experiments indicated, were
owing solely to the imperfection of the divisions of our thermo-
meters. If it be $0, it is not impossible to divide-the' scale of
a thermometer in such a manner as to indicate with certainty
equal increments of beat, as thermometers ought to do; but this
is not the proper place to enlarge on this subject, I may perhaps
return to it hereafter,

Passing over in silence, a number of experiments I made
in order‚Äù to get thoroughly acquainted with my new instru-
ments, and to assure myself that the results of similar ex-
periments made with them were -uniform, and might be. de-
