global state of the two identical particles |Y+), when expressed in terms of labelled particles, has
the form of an entangled state even if they are independently prepared far away from each other
and never interact. In other words, it seems that in the standard operational framework based
on local operations and classical communication (LOCC), these two particles become entangled
even if they are in a separable state at the beginning. To cope with this situation, that is, to
avoid observable effects of the unobservable labels, ‘we must now convince ourselves that this
entanglement is not matter of concern’ [12].

The viewpoint of the SA thus makes a straightforward discussion of correlations (such as
entanglement) in systems of identical particles problematic, because of the difficulty in formally
separating the real part of correlations from the unphysical one arising from labels. Moreover,
such a description hinders the use of a partial trace and the von Neumann entropy, as normally
done for non-identical particles [16]. In fact, indistinguishability implies that the particles are
not individually addressable and so the common reduced density matrix obtained by the partial
trace is meaningless. This issue has originated different treatments for a faithful quantification of
identical particle entanglement [16-33].


3. Non-standard approach to many identical particles

Here, we consider a recently introduced approach to deal with identical particles that does not
adopt unphysical labels to mark them [32]. This NSA eliminates ab ovo the conceptual strains
inherent in the SA and also allows us to directly focus on the treatment of physical quantum
correlations. So far, it has been applied to the case of two identical particles [32,33]. We now re-
examine this approach from a fundamental viewpoint and extend it to a system of many identical
