A second experiment was also arranged, in which the
conditions were precisely similar, excepting that 5 grams of cellulose were added to
the mixture.. The materials could not be stirred, and it was decided to leave them in
contact with confined air for a considerable time. The two vessels were, in fact, left
for 11 years, when, in 1871, they were opened, and the contents examined. The result was that in both cases there was a very considerable amount of nitrifica-
tion, representing in Experiment 1 rather more, but in Experiment 2 with the cellulose
less, than one-third of the original nitrogen of the soil. The actual loss of carbon was
more than 4 times as great in Experiment 2 with the cellulose, as in Experiment 1
without it ; amounting in Experiment 1 to about 16 per cent., and in Experiment 2 to
about 43 per cent. of the original quantity.
