'The occipital lobe was intact, as also the optic thalamus.

The olfactory tract and bulb were uninjured, as also the crura, corpora quadrigemina,
and corpus striatum.

This experiment is another link in the chain of evidence pointing to the association
of hearing and 8mell with integrity of the temporo-sphenoidal lobeâ€”hearing on the oppo-
8ite and smell on the same side. The hypothetical seats of these, the snperior temporo-
sphenoidal for hearing and the subiculum cornu ammonis for smell, were either disinte-
grated or cut off by the lesion described. 'Though the effect is not regarded as conclusive
proof of this ass0ciation, it will be seen to derive importance from conjunction with
other experiments to be related. At the same time, however, the fact is again noted
that tactile sensation was alnost completely abolished on the right side. This effect was
subsequent to the phenomena just observed, and apparently advanced with the process
of softening inwards towards the hippocampus and uncinate convolution.

Fig. 14 represents by the shaded part the extent Vig. 15 represents the extent of the lesion, as
of the lesion as een on the outer aspect of the left een on the inner aspect of the temporo-sphenoidal
hemisphere in Experiment XII. The dark shading lobe.
in the centre indicates the part at which the lobe
was deeply injured.
