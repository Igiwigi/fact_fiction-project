Surface charge, hav-
ing bands of positive and negative charge density in order to generate electro-osmotic
flows (EOFs), suggests other designs and there are undoubtedly many other possi-
ilities (Oddy et al. 2001). However, there may be technological issues to do with
he reliability of possible mechanisms. In fact, this is what at the moment seems to
imit devices based on EOF effects. Finally, some designs may be attractive but not
echnologically feasible. For example, planar fabrication techniques cannot produce
he geometric patterns in static mixer design.
