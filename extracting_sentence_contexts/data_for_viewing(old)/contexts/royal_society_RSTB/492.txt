If depressor influences were active and had not been impaired in any way, then the
slowing of the respiration was accompanied by slowing of the heart and a fall of blood
pressure. When the respiration was arrested the heart was greatly slowed, and then
stopped. But if the depressor influence had been lost the heart was only slowed a
little on the arrest of respiration, and there was no fall of blood pressure nor arrest of
the heart, and the slight slowing was altogether lost when the heart was acting very
quickly consequent upon paralysis of the cardio-inhibitory apparatus. The blood
pressure affected the heart rate apart from any cardio-inhibitory effect, for after
division of the vagi the heart became quickened as the blood pressure rose, and
slowed as it fell.

Respiration was directly influenced by the blood pressure, as shown by the fact
that a rise of blood pressure, the intra-cranial pressure remaining as before, tended
to start respiration again. Respiration began again, moreover, after artificial respira-
tion had been kept up a sufficiently long time for pressor influences to be established,
although the intra-cranial pressure still remained at the height which had arrested
the respiratory movements just before when the blood pressure was lower. And
conversely, no regular respiration could be obtained with low blood pressure, owing
to loss of the vasomotor tone. After division of the vagi under which circumstance
a sudden increase of intra-cranial pressure caused a marked rise of blood pressure, we
were able to excite respiration again by rapidly increasing the intra-cranial pressure,
owing to its influence in further raising the blood pressure.

After division of the vagi, and after commencement of artificial respiration, if the
