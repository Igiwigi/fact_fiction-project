BETWEEN THE FREEZING AND BOILING-POINTS, 219

the air temperature was recorded just at the calorimeter, as well as the temperature
of the balance case, but in general these never differed much from the temperature cf
the air as recorded on the barometer case, which was always taken with the reading
of the barometer. The weights are given here in grammes, just as recorded during
the experiment. The Abridged Tables sent in with the paper give the summary of
these observations, together with the necessary corrections. |

[Added May 28th, 1902.â€”H.T.B. The comparative failure of my attempts to
obtain consistent results in the experiments carried out previous to my discovery of
the effect of stream-line motion on the distribution of heat in the fine bore flow-tube,
appears to me to have been largely due to the fact that the stranded conductor was
in nearly all cases annealed before being inserted in the calorimeter. This caused
the different strands to lie together more in the nature of a solid conductor. It is
probable that better results would have been obtained in these early experiments
had the wires been stiffer, the flow-tube smaller, and had it been possible to
distribute the strands more thoroughly in the water column, and at the same time to
prevent them from changing their relative position in the tube between the
experiments. |
