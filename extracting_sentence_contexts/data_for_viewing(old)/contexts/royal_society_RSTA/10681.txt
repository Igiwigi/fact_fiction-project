place at the points w= 0, ie.,2 = +6 +e, where the shear rz varies discontinuously.

At all other points rr approaches the value zero continuously as we move up to the
outer surface of the cylinder.

Coming now to the distortion of the cross-sections, this is exhibited in Diagram 2
The displacements are exaggerated, as in Diagram 1, w) being taken = $c. The
cross-sections become hollowed out in the middle, the greatest longitudinal extension
taking place at the sides. Another noticeable feature is that the cross-sections are
slightly curled round the rim, except over the part of the cylinder which is subjected
to shear, where they slope up sharply. This follows from the fact that we + ae ae

Thus, where re = 0 and du/dz > 0 from Diagram 1, it follows that dw/dr < 0 or,
since dw/dr > 0 nearer the centre, a maximum value of w occurs at a comparatively

small distance inside the “ outer skin” of the cylinder. When, however, r2 increases
by 8, we have seen that du/dz increases by — $8/p, hence dw/dr increases by $8/p,
and is always positive at the outer surface. At the further end, where S ceases to
act, the reverse takes place.

It is now easy to understand why the tension is infinite at the inner end of the
