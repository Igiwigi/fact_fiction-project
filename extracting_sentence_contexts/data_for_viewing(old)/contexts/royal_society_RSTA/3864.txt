position variables alone), whereas M, Mare quadratic in the momenta, and also the positions; the
constants of the motion can detect the sign of angular momentum, but not linear momentum.

Of course, this set-up can be quantized directly to study the quantum polarization properties
of photons. However, we instead are considering a different physical situation, that of the scalar
behaviour of Gaussian laser modes in the focal plane, which nevertheless has strong mathematical
analogies with this view of the Poincaré sphere, even if the physical relationship is not (yet) clear.

3. Hermite—Gaussian and Laguerre—Gaussian modes as eigenfunctions of the
two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator

We have already stated that laser cavity modes in the focal plane are analogous to two-
dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions. In fact, the HG modes (1.1) are exactly
two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator eigenstates (albeit with the convention that the
usual width of a quantum oscillator w= wo/V2 for wo the optical focal beam waist); as in
the previous section, we set our constants to be dimensionless, and the appropriate choice is


w=1,wo =1/V2. Having introduced the classical Hamiltonian formalism in the previous section,
we can observe that the wave mechanics picture (i.e. ‘quantum mechanics’) comes purely from
canonical quantization, where observables H,L,M and M become operators on wave functions,
and in configuration space, p > p = —i(dx, dy) (in our optical wave mechanics, we have no h). We
defer the meaning of the quantization procedure (and, indeed, the significance to Gaussian beams
of the classical harmonic oscillator) until later—the fact that HG and LG modes are eigenstates
of the two-dimensional quantum isotropic harmonic oscillator should be sufficient motivation to
