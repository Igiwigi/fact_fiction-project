The most striking novelties in tin as compared with the metals previously studied are the
very short period of the oscillations, which accentuates some of the experimental difficulties
met with in gallium, and the peculiar modulation of the oscillations. A good deal of time
was spent investigating the nature of this modulation, but no satisfactory interpretation has
been found. The two features of the modulation which are difficult to understand are
(a) the alternating cusp-shaped and flat maxima and minima and (b) the fact that the
envelope of the minima is displaced from the mirror image of the envelope of the maxima
by half a period of the modulating cycle. At first it was thought that these features might
be associated with the finite twist of the crystal, which effectively makes y slightly different
for the maxima and the minima of the oscillations. This difference, however, is least for the
smallest values of Â¥, and since it is just then that the features (a) and (b) are most clearly
pronounced, and, moreover, since the features were just as pronounced in two specimens with

deflexions (i.e. twists of the crystal) differing by a factor of about 3, it is unlikely that they
are associated with the finite twist of the crystal.
