Also included are the celebrated forms of carbon: carbon nanotubes (any chirality), graphene and
buckminsterfullerine (Co). A glaring counter-example is manganese. In fact, bulk manganese,
whose structure is the union of four interpenetrating Bravais lattices, is better considered as an
alloy than an element, due to degenerate spin configurations [4]. This concept (1.1) could apply to the vertices of an origami structure, and we use this
interpretation in some of the examples below. An alternative concept, also used below, will be
one that applies to the tiles, that is, to collections of points.
