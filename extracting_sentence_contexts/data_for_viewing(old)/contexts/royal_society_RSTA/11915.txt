in Korrsev’s work, namely, a want of balance in the accuracy with which he attempts
to determine the various quantities he observes. Thus, in order to justify the
accuracy to which he gives the weight of silver deposited in his voltameter, the time
during which the current flowed would have to be known within z;4;5th of a second,
while, as a matter of fact, the current was made and broken by hand and was
reversed in the coils several times during a deposition, Again, although his average
Totation is about 4° of arc, and his vernier read to only yi5th of a degree, the
rotations are expressed to 1 part in 250,000.
