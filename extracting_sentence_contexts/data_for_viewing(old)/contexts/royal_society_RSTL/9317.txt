By substituting this value in (81), we see that however small the viscosity, the
nature of the motion, by which each particle assumes its snccessive positions, always
preserves the same character ; and the motion always involves molecular rotation.

But it has been already proved that, however slow the tidal motion of a fluid
spheroid may be, yet the fluid motion is always irrotational.

Hence in the two methods of attacking the same problem, different firs6 approxi-
mations have been used, whence follows the discrepancy of 79 instead of 75.

The fact is that in using the equations of flow of a viscous fluid, and neglecting
inertia to obtain a first approximation, we postulate that wh, w'E, w77, are less im-
portant than vv *Â«, v7 ?B, vp ?y; and this is no longer the case if v be very small.

It does nob follow therefore that, in approaching the problem of fluidity from the
side of viscosity, we must necessarily obtain even an approximate result.

But the comparison which has just been made, shows that as regards the form of
the tidal spheroid the two methods lead to closely similar results.

It follows therefore that, in questions regarding merely the form of the spheroid,
and not the mode of internal motion, we only incur a very small error by using the
limiting case when v=0 to give the solution for pure fluidity.
