Instead, one considers a possible change in the future. While we
the counterfactual asks whether ball B would have gone through (a) one-cause scenario (b)_two-cause scenario 3
the gate if ball A had not been there, the hypothetical asks
whether ball B would go through the gate if ball A were not
there. So, counterfactuals and hypotheticals differ in whether
the mind travels to the past or to the future.

For example, when judging causation in figure 1a, as
the balls enter the scene an observer may consider a
hypothetical simulation of where ball B would go if ball A
were not present in the scene, and then compare what actu-
ally happened to the outcome of this future hypothetical. In
fact, for the clips shown in figure 1, the hypothetical prob-
ability (would B go through the gate if ball A were not
there) and the counterfactual probability (would B have
gone through the gate if ball A had not been there) are the
same. These cases cannot distinguish between what kind of
mental time travel is involved in making causal judgements.
We need new evidence to determine whether counterfactuals
are necessary for explaining causal judgements, or whether
hypotheticals suffice.!

In this paper, I present new evidence that bears on the
question of what kind of mental simulation is involved
when people make causal judgements. First, I will clarify
