Age-dependence in branching probabilities: figure 5a shows the posterior estimated : =
asymptomatic branching probability bE>4 for different age groups a. Overall, around 55% of :8
exposed individuals are asymptomatic. This value is consistent with the large range of figures : =
suggested in the literature (e.g. from 18% to 75% [34-36]). Asymptomatic branching probabilities 28
are highest for younger age groups, which has important implications, e.g. for interpreting : 3
school cases rates (which may significantly under-represent true infection levels). The proportion 12
of asymptomatics declines through adulthood and rises again in older age groups (figure 52) : Ss
consistent with other studies based on data prior to vaccine availability (see e.g. fig. 2c in [24]). : Ss
The notable exception is in the 80+ and care home groups (which, by definition, are set equal’), a

which have a significantly lower asymptomatic branching probability. This result stems from
the fact that although many cases are observed in the 80+ group, measurements taken by the
CIS near the end of 2020 show only a small proportion of randomly sampled 80+ individuals
are found to be antibody positive. One possibility is that waning immunity is much faster
in this group, or that a weaker immune response results in more false negative antibody test
results.

The probability of hospitalization (given a case) bI~© and dying in hospital (given
hospitalized) b!> are shown in figure 5b and c, respectively. These detailed estimates are entirely
consistent with the broad understanding that COVID-19 affects the elderly much more severely
than the young.

Duration of PCR test sensitivity: estimated residency times in the PCR test-sensitive T
compartment are shown in figure 5d. As both I and A compartments are also detectable by
