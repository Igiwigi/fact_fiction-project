possessed no follicles with antra, fig. 5, Plate 9. This condition shows a slight connection
with the body weight of the animal and is probably more common in the younger animals
(but see p. 56). Itis difficult to say from the existing material whether steady or inter-
mittent growth brings about the enlargement of the originally small solid follicle till
it has the mean diameter of 600 ». The presence of crops of atretic follicles of about
400-600 » in many of the ovaries makes it possible that successive batches of follicles
grow and become atretic until the onset of the first pro-cestrus, when growth is con-

tinued. Owing to the fact that the prepubertal animals are of two types according to
when they are destined to have their first estrus, they do not make a very uniform
group considered together. There is, however, one set of animals forming a really
homogeneous group, ?.e., the prepubertal ones which fail to come into cestrus in the spring
and reach puberty in May or June. These animals are easily recognizable after
February. Table III shows the monthly averages for the weights of ovaries and uteri
in this group. The individual ovary weights are shown in Appendix 2 and fig. 3.

The ovarian development during this time is very largely follicular. Of the six
March animals only two had follicles with antra, while only one animal in each of the
other two months had no follicles of this type.
