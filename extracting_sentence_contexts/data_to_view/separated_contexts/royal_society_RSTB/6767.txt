77 is particularly striking. It is
from an ordinary section (the same which was used for Plates 16 and 17), but the coils
displayed agree exactly with those brought out by the ammonia treatment at the
preceding anaphase. The exceptional clarity of the spirals at the prophase of the
second meiotic division is a well-known fact, and they were several times observed at
this stage by writers (e.g. Newton 1925) before spiral structure was recognized as a
general phenomenon. The resting stage of interkinesis is therefore an episode which
has extraordinarily little effect on the real configuration of the chromosome thread,
in spite of great changes in its optical properties. All this evidence confirms completely the previous conclusion.
