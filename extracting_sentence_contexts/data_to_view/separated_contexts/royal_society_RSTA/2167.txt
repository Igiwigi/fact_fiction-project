A central configuration is an arrangement of the n-point masses whose
configuration vector satisfies VU(q) + AMq = 0 for some real constant A. This is clearly a special case of the relative equilibrium condition (4.11), with @* = Aly. In fact,
as we note below, for @ = (@1,@2) € SO(2)xy x SO(2)zw, we have = diag(—ot, -o, -0, —w%). Thus, qo is a central configuration if and only if qo is a relative equilibrium with group velocity
@ = (,) with —w? =A.

(c) Collinear relative equilibria
An n-point collinear configuration, for some n > 1, is one satisfying
qj =Aj40, (4.12)

for some Aj #0 for every j =1,2,...,n, all distinct, and qo € R}, qo £0. Recall the relative equilibrium condition (4.11):

Vvj;U(q) = = mje qj for allj=1...n.
