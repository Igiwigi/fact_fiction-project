Maybe they are formed by a similar mechanism as the pseudo-modes observed in
the solar atmosphere. Clearly, these deserve further studies. One of the shortcomings of the present study is the fact that the models from the various codes
were in many aspects quite different. Some had magnetic fields, some were pure hydrodynamical;
the fields of view, depths of the convection zone and vertical extent into the ‘chromospheres’,
spatial resolution, box size, duration, and diffusivities were all quite different. In a next step, to
better understand the significant differences between models of the various codes (cf. figures 6
and 15), we will attempt to repeat this study using the same (magneto-)hydrodynamic set-up,
same box size and resolution, same depth of the lower and upper boundaries, for both a low and
high diffusivity case with grey and non-grey radiative transfer.
