Ss adhering white corpuscles, nor did the capillaries which were fed by«them ; but those of
— the irritated part, though springing from the same trunk, were remarkably encrusted
VY with them from their origin to their minutest ramifications within the area, while the
£ capillaries and veins in the same part were similarly affected. This striking appearance
S Continued for hours after the chloroform had been applied, snccessive fully formed white
corpuscles adhering as they flowed in from the trunk, being evidently affected secondarily
to the change induced by the chloroform in the tissues of the web.

Thus the affection of the white corpuscles of the blood in an irritated part is in all
respects strictly parallel to that of the red discs, while the greater adhesiveness of which the
tormer are capable, renders the facts regarding them more obvious and unmistakeable.
© Being dexirous to verify the reults derived from the frog by observations upon mam-
malia, in which the aggregation of the red corpuscles asxumes a much more striking ap-
Pearance, I examined the wings of two small bats. In the first specimen, the corpuscles,

} both red and white, exhibited decided adhesiveness within the vessels, the web being appa-
rently in astate of irritation from injuries which the animal had sustained. In the other
ere was also some adhesivencss in the part that first met my eye, the red discs tend-
