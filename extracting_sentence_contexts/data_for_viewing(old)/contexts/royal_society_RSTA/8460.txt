Then it may be shown that

where the whole system is composed of surfaces 1 to % inclusive. This is known as
the ‘ equation for the addition of aberrations °; by means of it may be calculated the
aberration coefficients for the whole system in terms of those for the intermediate single
surfaces. In fact, it may be shown that
