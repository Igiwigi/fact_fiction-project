tissue is greater, and spongy tissue less, in amount in heliophylls than in
sciophylls, and this does not appear to be entirely due to transpiration effects. The number of stomata is often much greater in sun leaves than shade leaves,
and this character must be entirely independent of transpiration. Again, it is a
fairly general fact that sun plants have shorter internodes than those growing in
the shade, and stomata are very frequently confined to the lower face of the leaf. The modifications due to water are more numerous and important. A water
supply too small to come up to the requirements of transpiration operates on
both the form and structure of leaves.
