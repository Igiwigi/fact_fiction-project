S On making a vertical section of one of these vertebra in the longitudinal direction,
Sd or at right angles to the last, we find that the cartilage-cells external to the osseous
E, ring till display the same radiating disposition, the lines diverging as they approach
5 the periphery. The arrangement of the small cavities in the cylindrical bone is also
Z analogous. Those which form the surface of each concave articulating extremity are
Z very large, and are arranged in rows which are nearly parallel with that surface, having
© been developed around the cartilage-cells with which the latter portion is lined. Those
S which, on the other hand, constitute the exterior of the constricted osseous cylinder,
V are considerably smaller, and towards its terminal margins become subcompressed.
= We now also find that the osseous plate, constituting the floor of the neural canal,
© extends across the entire vertebra, and that its anterior and posterior extremities
EZ blend with the contiguous margins of the osseous cylinder. It is in fact a rudi-
EZ mentary vertical plate, serving the same purpose as that of the Ray, fig. 28 g; only
= instead of being developed, as in that example, direct from the osseous cylinder sur-
V rounding the chorda, it is formed at a distance from it, being attached to it only by
= its anterior and posterior extremities, the central portions of each being separated
Z from one another by a semicircular mass of cartilage. As the growth of the fish
A advances till further, this cartilage continues to be encroached upon both above and

below. TI have never yet met with an example in which it was completely obliterated
and its place wholly occupied by bone, but in very large and old fish it is nearly 89,
the plate connecting the two concave extremities being there very thick, the result of
successive additions made to both its surfaces. The preceding remarks also apply to
the corresponding plate on the opposite inferior surface of the centrum, only it never
