To obtain a second approximation we may substitute this in the small terms of

We can now substitute this value of M, in (viii.), and we find ;
M"’,= 3°370 + 2°980 = 6350,

This differs comparatively little from the actually observed value, 6°225, and is
satisfactory evidence of the validity of our theory. The fact that the elder generation
was in no way limited like the younger, and that we have neglected the third
moment—although fertility distributions are never normal—as well as made other
approximations, is quite sufficient to account for the difference observed. We may take it that 3°4 is practically the fertility of the elder generation, and
that this is raised to about 3°5 by reproductive selection in the younger generation. The result 6°2 for the elder generation is thus purely a result of weighting due to the
nature of the record.

(ii.) Table IL. gives the result of 1000 cases taken from the Peerage.
