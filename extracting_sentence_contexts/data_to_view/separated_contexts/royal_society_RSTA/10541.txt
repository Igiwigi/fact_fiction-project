few of the tests.

(28.) Improvements in the Design of the Culorimeter,

Although Dr. Barnes was naturally unwilling to introduce any radical changes in
the original pattern, which had proved to be capable of giving very good results. there
can be no doubt that it was capable of improvement, and I had in fact already noted
several points in which alterations were desirable. The importance of uniformity of bore in the flow-tube, and particularly in the out-
