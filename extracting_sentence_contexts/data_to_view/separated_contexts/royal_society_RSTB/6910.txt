After
wounding, however, there is a great increase in the rate of cell division, which is un-
connected with the oestrous cycle, and not influenced by repeated injections of oestrone. It affects especially the epidermal cells, but in the dermis and hypodermis cell division is
also common in the connective tissue cells, the capillary endothelial cells, the cells of the
hair follicles and sebaceous glands, as well as occasionally occurring in the striped muscle
of the panniculus carnosus. In fact, it is apparent that, with the exception of the leucocytes,
all cells within a radius of about 0-5 mm. of the wound are stimulated to abnormal mitotic
activity, and that beyond this radius the effect rapidly disappears. Cell migration, to-
gether with this abnormal cell division, ultimately closes the wound, and once this has
been achieved, mitotic activity is rapidly reduced. It is evident that the cell division associated with wound healing is not caused solely by
a general mitosis stimulator such as oestrone, for this abnormal activity is unrelated to the
oestrous cycle, it affects cells which are normally almost, if not entirely, inert, and it is
strictly local.
