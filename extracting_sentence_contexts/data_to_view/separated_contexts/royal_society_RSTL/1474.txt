The point Q is placed exactly under
the centre- of the screw A.

This point Q is to be considered as the point C, fig. 1. For although in fact the part of the rod HK where the screw
A passes, and rests upon the end of the rod HK, be the point
C,tig. 1; yet if a part of the tube I I, fig. g, at the point C be
taken at an-equal height with Q, fig. 4, as they are both of brass,
both will expand equally.
