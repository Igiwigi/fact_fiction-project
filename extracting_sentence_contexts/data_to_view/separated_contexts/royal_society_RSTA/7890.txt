SEARS AND H. BARRELL ON DETERMINATIONS OF FUNDAMENTAL

The reduction of the determinations in air further involved a knowledge of the
refractive index of air and of its variation with temperature and pressure. Additional
complications arose from the fact that the temperatures indicated by T, and © were
generally different, though only to the extent of 0-006,° C. on the average of the 16
determinations. The method adopted for the reduction of the determinations in air cannot be properly
described without some reference to the experimental procedure. Each value of Xx
was obtained by deriving the difference between the observed value of Lg and the
observed value of (L; — X\).
