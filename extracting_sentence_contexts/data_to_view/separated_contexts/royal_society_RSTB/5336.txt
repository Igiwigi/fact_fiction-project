The mid-gut in Hemimysis is long and formed directly by yolk cells. The liver has a
separate origin, arising from the mesoderm, or if the liver be considered as an endodermal
organ, then the head mesoderm bands can be termed mesendodermal. The fact remains
that the liver and mid-gut are not formed from a primary homogeneous endodermal layer. Now suppose that from such a form as Hemimysis the proctodeeum became longer and the
mid-gut shorter ; then the yolk cells could not all become mid-gut epithelial cells. Those
lying in that part of the body traversed by the proctodeeum would necessarily degenerate,
as they do in Hemimysis at the sides of the short proctodeum.
