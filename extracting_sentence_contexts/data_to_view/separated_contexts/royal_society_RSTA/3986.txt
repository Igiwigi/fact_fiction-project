However, compared with Ca@C¢o, hydrogen atom addition does not appear to aS
have a significant effect on the changes in charge polarization that occur as a result of the calcium aes)
atom moving through the fullerene. The changes in binding energy that accompany the formation [8
of Ca@CeoH4 remove the ‘Mexican hat’ potential observed previously for Ca@C¢o and create an a
asymmetric energy surface; therefore, it is proposed that certain isomers of Ca@CggH4 may form aa)
the bases of a bi-stable nanoswitch. Such a process may be facilitated by the fact that combinations

of the individual components, i.e. Ca@Cgq and CegHy, have already been synthesized. Competing interests.
