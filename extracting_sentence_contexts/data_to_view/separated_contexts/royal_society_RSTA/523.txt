5, commencing with some
large value of u’, goes round the pole O a number of times, and then falls short of O,
and describes a spiral inwards round P. Hence each path consists of a number of
loops, followed by a number of undulations of diminishing angular amplitude. In fact
the corrected phugoid partakes of the character of both loops and undulations, the
undulations consisting of a closer and closer approximation to the steady glide in the
direction y. Whether loops will appear or not, in fact, depends on whether the initial
point is taken before or after the last loop in the path. There is one exceptional hodograph, (4) in fig.
