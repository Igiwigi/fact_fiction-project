That 138 grains of carbonate of ammonia, taken in three consecutive days, should
not diminish the acidity of the urine is very remarkable. It is still more worthy of
attention that it actually increases the acidity. It appeared very desirable to test these
facts by further experiments.

(47.) The experiment with large doses of carbonate of ammonia was therefore re-

nia was taken, the yariations in the acidity of the urine were determined. Breakfast
