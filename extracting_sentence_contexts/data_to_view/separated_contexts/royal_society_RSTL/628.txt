In the same way, Fig. 16 is
likewise the result of the same combination ; but with the planes
of the third modification added to it. Lastly, Fig. 17 exhibits a detached crystal, of a perfectly de-
terminate form, and of about an inch in length, seven lines in
breadth, and five lines in height, which makes part of the col-
lection of Mr. Patties, who was 80 kind as to allow me to
examine it, as well as every other specimen of this substance in
his possession. ' It is, in fact, the variety represented in Fig. 16,
but in which the planes belonging to the fourth modification
have acquired a more considerable extent; while those which
belong to the third modification exist only on two of the op-

posite edges of the terminal faces, as was- observed in speaking
of the crystal represented in Fig. 10. Before I proceed to those observations which this triple sul-
phuret (a most interesting substance in mineralogy) affords me
an opportunity of making, with regard to the various ores that
are produced by the combination of sulphur and capper, of the
nature of which, neither mineralogy nor chemistry have yet

supplied any certain information, I think it right to make a few
remarks, upon Some circumstances relating to the different
modes of attraction that appear to influence the formation of
mineral substances. However imperfect this sketch may be, it
will at least serve to illustrate what I shall hereafter say, re-
specting the various ores I have just mentioned.
