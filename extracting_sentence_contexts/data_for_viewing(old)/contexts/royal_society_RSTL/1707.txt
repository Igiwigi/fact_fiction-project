I piece of very hard steel be softened, it is natural to
suppose that the operation will produce a corresponding
change in the elastic power, and that the same Toad would
produce a greater flexure in the soft state than in the hard
one, when all other circumstances were the same. Mr. Cov-
LoMB inferred from some comparative experiments on small
specimens, that the state of temper does not alter the elastic
force of steel ; and your Experiments on Vibration led to
the same conclusion (Nat, Philos. IT. 403). But the subject
appeared to require further investigation, and particularly
because it afforded an opportunity of ascertaining some other
facts respecting steel, which had not been before examined.
In making the experiments which I am about to describe,
each bar was supported at its ends by two blocks of cast
iron. These blocks rested upon a strong wooden frame.
The scale to contain the weights was suspended from the
middle of the length of the bar, by a cylindrical steel pin of
about ths of an inch in diameter. And as in experiments of
this kind it is desirable to have the means of raising the
weight from the bar, without altering its position, in order
to know when the load is sufficient to produce a permanent
change of structure, I have a powerful screw with a fine
