Prevosr and Dumas remark,
that they were not able to detect any blood-globules on the surface. To what else,
then, than to these, or to their broken-down particles, could the reddened colour
of the ova in their experiments be due ? The conclusion, then, to which I am led by these experiments is, that although the
envelopes of the egg imbibe coloured fluid, they do s0 less easily than when the fluid
is not coloured, unless it is in chemical combination ; and although atoms of solid
matter, very much smaller than the spermatozoa, may possibly be carried by infiltra-
tion into the texture of the egg-envelope by the act of endosmose during its expansion,
it appears to be extremely unlikely that the large bodies of the spermatozoa are 80
carried in; an improbability which is raised almost to a certainty by the fact that the
spermatozoa are not seen attached to the egg with a centripetal direction of the axis
of their bodies, but are constantly applied laterally to, or are entangled amongst the
loose tissue of the surface, extended at length or partially folded on themselves.

6. AGENCY OF SPERMATOZOA AS AFFECTED BY CHEMICAL MEDIA. The experiments with carmine having led to an unexpected result in the impedi-
ment which this medium offers to the impregnation of the oyvum when immersed in it
before contact with the spermatozoa, I was desirous of ascertaining what effect would
be produced on the ovum by the destruction of the spermatozoa by chemical means,
immediately after they had been applied to it.
