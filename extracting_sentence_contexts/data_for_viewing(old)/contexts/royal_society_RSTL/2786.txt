will tend to enhance its value in the estimation of those who take an interest in such
applications as are now, or may hereafter be, made of it, and eyen in this respect
render it not inferior in point of value to any other loci except the conic sections,
and perhaps the logarithmic curve*.

As both systems of branches of the magnetic curye are found to be inyolyed in the
same angular equation, and in the same rectangular one also by means of the double

* It is certainly a remarkable cireumstance, that 80 few of our moxst elegant curyes (geometrically considered)
are capable of being rendered 8ubservient to physical inquiries : for with the exceptions above mentioned, there
is, besides the cycloid and the harmonic curve, with perhaps one or two of the spirals, scarcely one which could
not be expunged from our geometry without any serious injury to physical science. This, together with the
fact that in the dynamical problems which occur in physics, it is found to be generally most conyenient to
as8ume the time as the independent variable, has led some writers, too hastily as it appears to me, to conclude


CONCERNING TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 77

8ign of the radicals,â€”s0 also, as we should expect from the same principles being
employed in both cases, in the equation of the curve of yerticity the branches adapted
to like poles and those adapted to unlike poles, are expressed in the same equation
given in my former paper. It required, then, the previous separation of the two
systems in the magnetic curye as a preliminary step to the separation of those in the
curve of yerticity. Such is the course I have pursued, but I have carefully abstained
from the insertion of any properties of either curye except those which were essential
