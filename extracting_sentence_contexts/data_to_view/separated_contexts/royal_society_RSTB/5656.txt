(i) That high E-ness
and K-ness are the ends of a graded series and that all sinistrals have a tendency to
embryonic misdevelopment and the production of phenotypic dextrals, which varies
in different strains and is heritable: this does little more than re-state the facts. (i) That high H-ness is qualitatively different from the habit of « strains to produce
occasional dextrals, that it depends on a genetic factor, and that its manifestation
is masked when it is associated with K-ness. Our facts are very similar to those described by Wrigut and Eaton (1923) for
otocephaly in in-bred strains of guinea-pigs. The monstrosity varies from a defect in
Meckel’s cartilage to cyclopia and on to an almost headless condition, and the different
forms fall into a single graded series. Monsters appear suddenly in some substrains
of animals, some of which afterwards produce more and more, so that by gen. 20 or
thereabouts one strain may have 20 per cent.
