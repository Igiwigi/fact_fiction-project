91.) The physical meaning of this is, that in this case the condition of the gas
caunob be supposed to vary uniformly even along the lines of flow. It mus vary after
a fixed law, and this fact restricts the conditions under which the equations can be

considered to hold to points where : is 80 8mall that (c) may be neglected. So that

any general result obtained from these equations would only apply to points at
considerable distances from the foci C and C'. Again, these equations as they stand include the case in which the flow of the gas
may be caused by a considerable difference of pressure, as, for example, transpiration
through a small aperture under Pry.
