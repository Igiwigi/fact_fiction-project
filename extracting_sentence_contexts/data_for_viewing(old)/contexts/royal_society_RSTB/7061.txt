optic nucleus has been put at 50,000—-70,000 for man (Rasmussen 1938), 30,000-40,000
for the monkey (Magoun & Ranson 1939), 35,000—41,000 for the dog and 7000 for the rat
(Rasmussen 1940). The number of fibres in the neural stalk appears to be considerably less
than would be expected from these figures. Rasmussen (1938) found in man that the
supraoptic nuclei together contain twice as many cells as are necessary to account for the
fibres in the neural stalk. Also in the Macaque monkey, Rasmussen (1938) found in an
actual fibre count 40,000 unmyelinated fibres in the lower part of the stalk, whilst the total
number of cells in the two supraoptic nuclei of this animal according to Magoun & Ranson
(1939) would be about 70,000. These last workers offered the following suggestions to
account for the discrepancy, first, that some fibres from the cells of the supraoptic nuclei
may end in the median eminence proximal to the level at which the fibre count was made,
and secondly, that the fibre counts are too low, owing to the technical difficulty of counting
fine unmyelinated fibres. The fact that other hypothalamic nuclei probably contribute
fibres to this system would appear to make this discrepancy still greater. In view of their
common phylogenetic origin (Meyer 1935), and their similar morphological characters as
regards cytoarchitecture and blood supply, it might be expected that the fibre connexions
of the paraventricular nucleus with the hypophysis would be similar to those of the supra-
optic nucleus. The evidence on this point is equivocal, though many workers have described
paraventriculo-hypophysial fibres. Laruelle (1934) described two groups of these fibres,
an external and internal set. Many fibres may be seen running from the paraventricular
nucleus towards the tuber cinereum, but it is probable that most of these do not continue
to the hypophysis but end in the supraoptic nucleus, or more caudally on cells scattered
in the region of the tuber. Evidence that the paraventricular nucleus does not contribute
a major component to the fibres of the neural stalk is seen from the lack of well-marked
degenerative changes in this nucleus following lesions of the infundibular stem. Some
