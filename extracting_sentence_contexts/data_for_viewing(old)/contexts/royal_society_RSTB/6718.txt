SUMMARY

A description is given of the features of forty-four brains of Australian aborigines,
which was undertaken in the attempt to discover the existence of racial features.

The different regions are classified in a more or less arbitrary manner to facilitate
comparison with the brains of other races. Many interesting and suggestive facts
emerge. In the lateral occipital region the general pattern of the sulci, together
with other features, shows two distinct methods of folding of the striate cortex, one
horizontal and one vertical. In the horizontal foldings various forms of sulcus
lunatus are revealed, whereas in the vertical foldings this sulcus is not so commonly
found, but the intrastriate sulci are disposed in an almost stereotyped manner.

The percentage occurrence of the different types differs materially from that of
a standard group of one hundred Chinese brains used for comparison. These
groupings do not settle the question of racial difference because similar types can
be seen in both races.

In the Australian there is clear evidence of a lack of development of the praecuneal,
