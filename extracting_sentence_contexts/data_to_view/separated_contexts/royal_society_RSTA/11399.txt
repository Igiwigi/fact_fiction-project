Effects of this kind
have already been described in detail (see §9). At low temperatures the positive
ionisation obtained with this apparatus seemed to be different in character, for it was

[* Note added September 7, 1906.—It seems advisable to indicate the exact hearing of this argument
more precisely. It is intended to confirm the conclusion, which has been drawn from direct experiment
on page 52, that the high value of the negative ionisation in a vacuum containing traces of hydrogen is
due to the fact that the hydrogen keeps the surface of the wire in a certain state, rather than that the
wire contains a certain amount of hydrogen. The writer does not wish to create the impression that
hydrogen never exerts a direct influence on the magnitude of the negative leak. The numbers on
p. 53 show that the value of the ionisation, at constant temperature, increases with the pressure of
the hydrogen at high pressures; so that it is probable that at high pressures there is a negative leak
which is a definite function of the pressure of the hydrogen.
