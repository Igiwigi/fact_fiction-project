openings, $0 as to scatter the semen over an extent of surface,
while the urine passes by a separate canal into the rectum. The female having no common uterus ; and the tubes which

ceiving the semen immediately from the penis of the male. These characters distinguish the Ornithorhynchus, in a very
remarkable manner, from all other quadrupeds, giving this new
tribe a resemblance in some respects to birds, in others to the
Amphibia; so that it may be considered as an intermediate link
between the classes Mammalia, Aves, and Amphibia ; and, al-
though the great difference that exists between it and the Myr-
mecophaga, the nearest genus we are at present acquainted
with, shows that the nicer gradations towards the more perfect
quadrupeds are not at present known, the facts which have
