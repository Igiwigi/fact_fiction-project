amount of qualification. Hzapr’s declaration (1905, p. 262) that sperms require four
hours to reach the region of the infundibulum in the rabbit, implies a slower rate of
migration than would be inferred from HmnsEn’s observation (1876, p. 231; 1881,
p- 113) that rabbit sperms reached the ovary in two and three-quarter hours. In my
own tests on rabbits I have twice found active sperms close to the infundibulum three
hours after copulation. I am, therefore, inclined to believe that Hrapr’s estimate of
four hours is somewhat long. In small mammals, such as the rat, sperms reach the |
ovarian end of the uterus, according to Harrman and Batt (1930), in less than two
minutes after ejaculation. This very short period lends credence to LrucKkart’s state-
ment (1853, p. 919) that he and Biscnorr found guinea-pig sperms in the middle of the
tube of this animal a quarter of an hour after copulation.

Notwithstanding the fact that rabbit sperms may live thirty-eight days in the male
ducts (HamMonD and AsDELL, 1926) and from seven to nine days in an environment
essentially external (IWANow, 1926; Wotr, 1921), their ability to fertilise, as already
stated, lasts after their entrance into the female tracts at most some thirty hours. Their
life in the exterior, even up to forty-nine hours and under conditions of transportation,
has been shown by Watron (1926) not to prevent their power to fertilise, though
YAMANE and Karo (1928) set some twenty-four hours as the extreme for such capacity.
Hammonp (1930), however, has shown that rabbit sperm at 10° C. may retain the power
to fertilise for as much as ninety-six hours. In spite of these variations in the time
limits for rabbit sperms, these results agree fairly well with those for most other mammals
as noted by Yocum (1929).

The liberation of the egg of the rabbit, ordinarily put at about ten hours after coitus,
