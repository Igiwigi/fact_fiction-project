In the same way one can formulate further necessary conditions which stem from the fact
that certain subgroups of G,, G,, etc., which are intersections of groups H,,, H,,, ..., are to
be mapped on to one and the same intersection of groups GG), ... in P. These further
conditions are, however, all satisfied as soon as the stated conditions are assumed; this is
shown by the following lemma and corollary (Hanna Neumann 1948). Lemma.
