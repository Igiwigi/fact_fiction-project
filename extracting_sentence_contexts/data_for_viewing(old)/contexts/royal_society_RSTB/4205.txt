the disparity in length of the two flagella is much greater in the true Phyllomitus
than in the case of the other form, as figured by either Kips or ALExererr. Hence
I do not think that the species amylophagus belongs to the genus Phylloinitus
at all.

The nucleus is situated near the anterior end of the body, but it is always

spherical, never drawn out in the direction of the basal granules of the flagella
(as in Cercomonas), and appears to be unconnected directly with them. There is no
kinetonucleus. The cytoplasm often contains several ingested masses of food-material
or Bacteria (figs. 13, 14, 16), or else food-vacuoles (fig. 15). When one of these
coprozoic flagellates feeds usually in a holozoic manner, there is not the slightest
doubt about it ; the cytoplasmic contents, in stained preparations, reveal the fact.

I have seen the later stages of binary fission occurring in the living individual and
have also obtained indications of the process in stained preparations. I have not yet
observed the earliest stages in the process and so cannot say whether the dividing
individual becomes first of all quite motionless for a short period. From the time
when the body begins to be elongated and constricted about the middle in a dumb-
bell-shaped manner to the ultimate separation of the two daughter-individuals, a
period of only about 9 minutes elapses. Hence division in Phyllomitus undoubtedly
takes place in the same rapid manner that it does in the other coprozoic flagellates ;
probably the entire process does not occupy more than 15-20 minutes. From the
time when the dumb-bell form is attained, the dividing body undergoes active,
spasmodic vibrations, and the flagella of both daughter-individuals are now present ;
