dynamics are associated with rigid body motions of the WO, tetrahedra, and that the Zr-O bonds
are relatively stiff, but that there is allowed bending of the octahedral bond angles [52,53]. Here,
I point out the important fact that in the general case (perovskites being the exception) systems
consisting of octahedra within the network will be over-constrained and no RUMs are possible
[54]. ZrW2Og is in principle allowed to support RUMs because one of the vertices of each WO4
tetrahedra is not connected within the network [55]. I will make further remarks about ZrW2Og
below (84d).

(c) Flexibility in metal-organic frameworks

The issue of analogous RUM flexibility in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has hardly been
explored, but one simple system that has been studied—Zn(CN),—might point to some
interesting warnings. I introduced the fact that there are 8 RUMs per wave vector earlier (§2)
[21,22]. Of these, two are transverse acoustic modes, three are optic modes involving transverse
displacements of the CN ligands from the Zn—CN-Zn linkage, and three are optic modes
involving twisting of the Zn—Cn-Zn linkage through rotation of the CN linkage. At first sight,
we can imagine that the six optic mode RUMs provide the tension effect for the extraordinarily
large NTE in this material, as has been suggested also for some metal cyanides with lower-
dimensional network structures [56,57]. However, our calculations of the relevant forces and
phonon dispersion curves [37] have shown that there are important directional forces that favour
linear Zn—CN-Zn linkages and which are sufficiently strong to push the frequencies of the
transverse displacement and twist modes up to 2-4THz and around 9THz, respectively. Thus
the motions that gives a strong tension effect also increase the frequencies and hence, importantly,
decrease the mode amplitude. In fact it turns out that the NTE in Zn(CN)9 is caused primarily by
the RUM transverse acoustic modes [37,58].
