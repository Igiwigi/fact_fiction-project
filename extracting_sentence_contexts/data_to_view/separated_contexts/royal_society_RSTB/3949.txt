Our index for this purpose is furnished by the respiratory
quotient, which in our experiments rose invariably during the work. Taking first of
all exercise up to the pace of 44 miles an hour, it will be noted that the actual value
of the respiratory quotient tends to be higher at any given pace on Pike’s Peak than
in Oxford, but if the respiratory quotient during the exercise is compared with that
obtained in the standing rest experiment done immediately beforehand in each
instance, it will be found that the degree by which the respiratory quotient rose is
much the same in each series, since the initial respiratory quotients on the Peak are
on the whole higher than in Oxford. This fact, coupled with the lack of variation in
