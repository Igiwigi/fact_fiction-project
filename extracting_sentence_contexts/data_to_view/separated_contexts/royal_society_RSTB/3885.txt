Out of the 124 pairs of parents and offspring of Table XIV, 15 offspring matured
in their parents’ cages, and the other 109 were exchanged when 5-7 days old into

influences the dimensions is, of course, the growth of the animal, and consequently it
is of the greatest importance to make the measurements on animals of the same age,
or, rather, at the same stage of development. ‘This is not so easily done in an Aphid
as in a Cladoceran, owing to the fact that the former grows continuously, and not
only at each ecdysis. This is shown by the following record of measurements and observations on a living
specimen. This is only one example of several such records, all of which are closely
similar to this one.
