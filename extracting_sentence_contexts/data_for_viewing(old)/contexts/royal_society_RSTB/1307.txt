(1.) A cylindrical glass vessel of 328 cub. centims. capacity was washed first wi
potassium hydrate and secondly with dilute hydrochloric acid, and finally boiled fo
an hour about half filled with water. A beaker of water was also boiled for about
hour, and then let cool to the air temperature, while only covered with a she
of filter paper to keep out dust. The vessel was inserted into this while ebullitic
was going on within it, so that it drew up sufficient water from the beaker to cor
plete its filling. In sealing, a bubble of air was permitted to remain in the tubului
The volume of this bubble at atmospheric pressure was estimated at about 0°05 eu
centim. In this vessel the tension obtained by heating till the bubble disap

* The actual state of the transpiration water is not, so far as we are aware, known; still, from #
fact that sap forced up by root-pressure contains some dissolved air, it may be inferred that the transp
ration sap will not be air-free. A qualitative experiment on the sap forced up by the root-pressure
Cordyline rubra showed that it contained a small quantity of dissolved gas.
