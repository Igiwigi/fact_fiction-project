* These results were obtained in the absence of seed grains; even when grains are present in such con-
ditions they do not grow, so that these figures can be considered as consistent with the others in the table. It is clear from table 2 that most of the phosphorus compound is absorbed during growth
and removed from solution in spite of the fact that Calgon is a very soluble material. Indeed
the effect is most noteworthy when the Calgon is present at the lowest concentrations. Table 3 gives the results of calculations (based on the data of table 2) showing the P,O,
contents of solution and solid phases in the various experiments, correlated with the various
modes of precipitation of calcium carbonate which have already been described.

TABLE 3. DisrRiBUTION OF PHOSPHORUS BETWEEN SOLUTION AND SOLID PHASES AS A RESULT
OF PRECIPITATING CALCIUM CARBONATE IN THE PRESENCE OF CALGON AND OF SEED
GRAINS (21Â° C)

p-p-m. of P,O, in PO, content
crystallizing of solid
mode of precipitation vessel deposited
much fresh nucleation 0 0
nucleation completely suppressed 0-3 011%
(in CaCO,)
some hexahydrate formed; little growth 1-4 insufficient
on some of the grains data
little growth on any of the grains; most 3-0 0-28 %
of the precipitation as hexahydrate (in CaCO,.6H,O)

These results bring out the fact that although striking effects on crystal growth are
obtained from solutions containing extremely small concentrations of Calgon, the con-
centration of additive in the solid is appreciable.
