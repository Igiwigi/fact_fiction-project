A close examination of figure 5a reveals locally objective molecular structures with molecules
of different size. By selecting the powers p,q suitably, one can also make a uniform molecule.
Figure 6 shows a case with a diatomic molecule. Again, necessarily, there is a seam, which is
chosen to be helical in figure 6b.

The non-discrete groups here offer a lot of additional freedom on the structure of the molecule
and its placement with regard to its neighbours, at the expense of a seam. For example, a much
enlarged set of lattice parameters becomes possible that would not be possible with a helical
objective atomic structure. Since we have no idea what are the non-discrete groups of isometries,
we do not know the scope of these methods at this time. So, we confine attention to examples.
A familiar biological example of a structure of the type shown in figure 5b is the microtubule. In
fact, it is argued in [33] that the axial seam of the microtubule is functional and aids in assembly
and disassembly of the microtubule.

(b) Viruses and quasi-crystals

In this section, we explain a relation between the use of non-discrete groups and known methods
of describing the structures of animal viruses and quasi-crystals.

(i) Virus structure

Reidun Twarock, Thomas Keef and collaborators [34-38] developed a way of looking at the
structure of icosahedral viruses, especially of the families Papovaviridae and Nodaviridae, that
