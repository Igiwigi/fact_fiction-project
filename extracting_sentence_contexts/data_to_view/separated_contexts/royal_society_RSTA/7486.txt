The heat of formation of hydrogen from atomic hydrogen is based on spectroscopic
and calorimetric determinations, whereas the heat resulting from the formation of
water vapour from OH and hydrogen is derived from explosion experiments by Lewis
and von Elbe (1935 4). The heats of formation of oxygen and nitrogen have a spectro-
scopic basis,

With regard to the compressibility characteristics of the various gas mixtures both
before and after explosion, it was considered reasonably safe to assume that under the
high temperatures reached in the explosion the perfect gas state was attained. Direct
experimental determinations could, however, be made in regard to the unburnt
mixture at the charging pressure and temperature and this was, in fact, done. The
method and apparatus are described in the Supplement. Reference has already been made to determinations of specific heat based on
spectroscopic data.
