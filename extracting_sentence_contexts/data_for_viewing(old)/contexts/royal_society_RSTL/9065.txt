required some attention to detect the appearance of this fugitive life, which existed
only 80 long as there was oxygen to sustain it. I have ranged the sealed and unsealed
tubes side by side in groups. 'To the most cursory obseryation the difference between
them is obvious. The experiment strikingly illustrates the dependence of the special
organisms here implicated on the oxygen of the air,

Q The experiments were pushed till further on the 28th of December. Two bulbs of
