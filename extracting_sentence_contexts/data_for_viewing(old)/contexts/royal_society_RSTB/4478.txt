wall, that is at right angles to the surface. The axis of least swelling lies in the
tangential plane, that is parallel to the surface of the wall, and is inclined in the
spiral course of the striz or pit-slits. An intermediate amount of swelling takes
place along a tangential axis at right angles to this. The axes of optical elasticity
are the inverse of these, the least -in the radial direction, the greatest along the
spirals of the strize, and the intermediate one at right angles to these.

The main trend of botanical opinion has favoured, more or less completely, the
micellar hypothesis of NAGrLi; it is a remarkable tribute to the hypothesis that
even quite recently some workers with colloids, such as BACHMANN,* von WEIMARN,t
and Braprorp{ should have made use of some of the main conceptions of NAGELI,
in explaining the structural properties of gels. It has, however, been frequently
pointed out that many of the facts, on which the micellar hypothesis was based,
are incorrect. These facts need not be referred to in detail, but NAGeEnt’s conception
of essentially crystalline character of the cell-wall in plants must be considered in
relation to the present work on wood. To-day, the substance of the cell-wall is
usually regarded as an emulsoid gel. It is, therefore, probably non-crystalline in
structure for, according to Wo. Ostwap§ and to BacHMANN, no emulsoid gel has
been proved to be crystalline. Von Wermarn, however, regards many gels as
possessing crystallinity, and Braprorp has recently extended von Wremarn’s
theory to certain of the organic gels. Alternative explanations to the micellar
hypothesis have been proposed, but, with the possible exception of SrRAsBURGER’S||
molecular-net hypothesis, none of them has attempted to explain more than one
or two of the sets of properties first studied (in this connection) by NAgGgE.t.
Prerrer’t has pointed out that the properties of elasticity and rigidity have not
