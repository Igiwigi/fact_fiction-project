to examine the sectional areas taken in a line through the rivet-holes with the section
of the plates themselves. It is perfectly obvious, that in perforating a line of holes
along the edge of a plate, we must reduce its strength ; and it is also clear, that the
plate 80 perforated, will be to the plate itself nearly, as the areas of their respective
Sections, with a small deduction for the irregularities of the pressure of the rivets
upon the plate; or in other words, the joint will be reduced in strength somewhat
more than the ratio of its section, through that line, to the solid section of the plate.
For example, suppose two plates, each 2 feet wide and three-eighths of an inch thick,
to be riveted together with ten $-inch rivets. It is evident that out of 2 feet, the length
of the joint, the strength of the plates is reduced by perforation to the extent of 74
inches; and here the strength of the plates will be to that of the joint as 9: 6:187,
which is nearly the same as the respective areas of the solid plate, and that through
the rivet-holes, namely, as 24 : 16'5, From these facts it is evident that the rivets
cannot add to the strength of the plates, their object being to keep the two surfaces
of the lap in contact, and being headed on both sides, the plates are brought into
very close union by the contraction or cooling of the rivets after they are closed. It
may be 8aid that the pressure or adhesion of the two surfaces of the plates would add
to the stvength ; but this is not found to be the case, to any great extent, as in almost
every instance the experiments indicate the resistance to be in the ratio of their
sectional areas, or nearly 80,

If we take the ultimate strength of the Yorkshire plates in Tables I. and LI., it will
be found that the mean breaking weight of eight specimens, each with a sectional
area of *46 inch, is 26,168, and the strength of the single joint*, of the same descrip-
tion of plates with an area of :44 inch, is 18,591 ; this reduced gives the ratio of the
