We can only note that the regions constituted by Cxcr4-
expressing cells result more stretched as in the case of too high
cell sensitivity to SDFla. The embryonic formation of the zebrafish PLL is a phenomenon
of particular interest in developmental biology. It in fact allows
us to shed lights on several mechanisms and _ processes
underlying chemically induced collective movement and
organization. PLL morphogenesis involves the migration of a
primordium formed by epithelial cells with mesenchymal
characteristics, which undergo cyclical phenotypic differen-
tiations resulting in the assembly and deposition of rosette-like
structures (i.e. progenitor of neuromast sensory organs). In the present work, this phenomenon has_ been
approached from a modelling perspective by proposing a
discrete model with hybrid characteristics.
