Around the sides of the body, muscular structure was also in the
course of development, but as yet was exceedingly indistinct. I could observe no
perfect fibre. This fact will safficiently account for the entire absence of spontaneous
motion in the embryo up to this period. A new process was now about to commence,
â€”the development of new segments. We have seen that on the third day the pos-
terior part of the body is less distinctly divided into segments than the anterior, the
first five segments being most distinctly marked.
