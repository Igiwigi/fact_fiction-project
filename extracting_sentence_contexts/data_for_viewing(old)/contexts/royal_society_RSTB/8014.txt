be interpreted in the same way, but the present writer has not studied this account at first
hand. The account given by Paterson & Dun (1898) of a very complicated hymeneal
valve at the junction of the urogenital canal and the vagina is very difficult to assess. In
the first place, this specimen diverged widely from the normal in the structure of its
reproductive tract, as described above, and it was a large animal which had spent all its
life in captivity. In the second place, Paterson’s figure is at least partly diagrammatic, and
though the description in the text is quite definite, it is very possible for a chance form, or
a temporary fold, to be mistaken for a characteristic structure in so difficult a subject.
Neuville concludes that the ‘hymen’ of Paterson & Dun’s account was wrongly so called,
and that in any case it is not a normal or usual structure. Of the three female African
elephants, the reproductive tracts of which have previously been described, one, that of
Perrault (1734), appears to differ from the normal form. This is an early account, and it
may be doubted whether the specimen was in fact other than normal. In the text,
Perrault describes the uterus as being divided longitudinally into right and left halves,
with separate openings into the vagina (which he called the ‘corps de la matrice’). But
he figured this region as having a curious transverse septum, convex towards the vagina,
and pierced not by two but by four orifices, of irregular outline. In this case, as Neuville
says, one may take one’s choice between the text and the figure, but whatever this sieve-like
structure may have been, it seems possible that Perrault’s specimen was in fact normal, the

description being faulty owing to the peculiar difficulties of the dissection. This seems, also,
to be the most likely explanation of the peculiar valvular structures which Perrault
