That described an empty (zero matter density) space, static model as
was originally proposed by de Sitter. It was later realized that it may also be described as a model
for an expanding universe in both time directions, because of the negligible effect of gravitational
attraction. In fact, it is constantly accelerating with time due to Einstein’s cosmological constant
term introduced earlier the same year that de Sitter spacetime first appeared. The de Sitter universe has no beginning or end. This universe plays the role of an ‘undisturbed’
state for the modified Einstein equations with a cosmological term, in a similar way as does
Minkowski space for the original field equations (i.e. with 4 = 0).
