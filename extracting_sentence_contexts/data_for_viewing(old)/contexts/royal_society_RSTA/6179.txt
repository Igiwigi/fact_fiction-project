The key assumptions which lead to the above results for the spectrum of fluctuations is
that we have an emergent phase with thermal equilibrium. In this case, the perturbations will
be of thermal origin (unlike in inflation where they are quantum vacuum fluctuations). The
curvature perturbations are given by the energy density fluctuations of the thermal gas, and
the gravitational waves are induced by the off-diagonal pressure perturbations. In connecting
the matter fluctuations to the metric inhomogeneities we must make the assumption that the
physics on infrared scales (the ones probed in current observations) reduces to the theory of linear
perturbations in General Relativity, such that the formalism of [8,9] can be used. In order to obtain
a scale-invariant spectrum for perturbations in three large spatial dimensions, it is important that
the matter correlation functions have holographic scaling, i.e. they scale as the area of the box and :
not as the volume. The specifics of the emergent model are not important as long as these three :=
criteria are met. We will in fact see in the following section that the criteria can be realizaed in a Da
very different setting. :B

String Gas Cosmology provides a toy model of the very early Universe which goes beyond what
EFTs can yield. However, in [27], no dynamics for the emergent phase, the Hagedorn phase, was [8
provided. It is clearly of utmost importance to put the ideas of [27] on a firmer dynamical footing. 7S
An early attempt at providing a dynamical background for string cosmology is Pre-Big-Bang .
Cosmology [80] (see [81] for an extensive review), which is based on the action of the massless
bosonic modes of string theory. Setting the antisymmetric tensor field B,,, to zero, this yields
the equations of motion of dilaton gravity. The T-duality symmetry is reflected in a scale factor
duality symmetry of the equations of motion. However, in this approach to date no phase has
