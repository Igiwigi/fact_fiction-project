Secondly, that the granules (Plate XXVIII. figs. 48, 51 c)
exactly resemble in size, colour and form, those produced by the internal surface of
the ovary (Plate XXVII. fig. 41 k). Lastly, because the striz (fig. 41 7) of the ovary
cease just where the ovule ceases to become larger (fig. 42 kh). The fact that the ovula were packed edgewise in this part of the tube (Plate XXVIII.
fig. 49 c) was pointed out to me by Dr. ALLEN TaomsoN ; also that three or four occu-
pied the same plane (fig. 50d). Hence the necessity of the oyula assuming the tri-
angular form (Plate XXVII. fig. 47); the only form met with as long as the ovyula
present the appearance of a dense opake mass (Plate XXVIII. fig. 49).
