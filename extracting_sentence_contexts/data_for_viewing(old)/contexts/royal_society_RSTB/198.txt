shaped bodies provided with long or short striated tails, each cup being lined with an
evlarged motor (electric) plate, and coated with a richly nucleated layer of protoplasm.
The form and character of these cup-shaped organs seem to indicate that they have
been retarded in their development; but the question still remains—Are they advancing
or receding? Are these electric cups degenerated discs, or are they the primitive
ancestral elements out of which the discs have been evolved? Do these characteristic
cups ever develop into discs, or do they, after having persisted for a time, finally
disappear, or are they distinct and independent structures ?

These and various other questions at once suggest themselves for solution, but in
the meantime I need only say that I believe the large discs of the common Skate
have been derived from cup-shaped structures, such as still persist in certain adult
forms—that, in fact, the electric plate of the disc in Raia batis is the greatly
expanded lining of a simple cup-shaped structure, such as exists in Raia radiata,
while the accessory portions of the disc have been derived from the muscular substance

composing the body of the cup, ;
To make the account of the development intelligible it will be desirable to shortly
