Since this Paper was laid before the Society, the author has
received from Sir Josxpn Banks a specimen containing five
fossil vertebra of the Proteo-Saurus, each of them two inches
in diameter, and one inch in thickness, found in the blue
lias at Weston, near Bath, sent to him by the Rev. DanitL
Lysons. This fact is important, as it proves that the fossil
bones met with in the blue lias in that neighbourhood, which
have always been considered to be those of the: Crocodile,
belong to this animal. |
