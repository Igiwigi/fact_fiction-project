chlorophyll is formed, the production of oil is here obviously independent of carbon
dioxide assimilation.

In the case of the oil in the epidermal cells of Hibiscus, ete., it seemed at first
to be possible that the leucoplasts in these cells might be regarded as oil-forming

organs, but the improbability of this is shown by the fact that they sometimes
contain starch in minute granules.

In the higher plants oil has not yet been proved to be a direct product of carbon
dioxide assimilation.*

On the contrary, WAKKER states that the oil in the chlorophyll bodies of
Monocotyledons which form no starch is not a product of assimilation, but rather
indicates the beginning of degeneration. He also notes that the oil was chiefly
found in plants grown in greenhouses. This statement is interesting in connection
with the fact that all the outgrowths developed during the present experiments
were formed in plants grown under glass.
