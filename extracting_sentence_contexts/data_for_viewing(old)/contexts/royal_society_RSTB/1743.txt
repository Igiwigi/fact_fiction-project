2 and these must almost certainly have been subterranean, The well-developed xylem
> of the roots renders it probable that they vegetated in a fairly firm soil.
The stem is mechanically well-constructed and thus fitted to maintaiu an upright
2 position while bearing abundant foliage. We have no distinct evidence for any
thizome-like organs, but it is possible that some of the small shoots which are rather
2 deficient in sclerenchyma may have been creeping or subterranean. The small
3 specimens, which constitute almost the whole of our material, could not have been
$ branches borne on main stems, for in that case they would not have borne adventitious
: roots. If the plant really attained a relatively large size, then we must assume that
| our material is made up of young specimens.

This brings us to the most important of all questions, that as to the fructification.
It is a remarkable fact, that though Lyginodendron Oldhamium is one of the
commonest of our English coal-fossils, and though all its vegetative organs are pre-
served with astonishing perfection, no certain traces of reproductive organs have
ever been discovered.

If the plants constituting owr material had borne anything at all of the nature of
4 cone, it is difficult to understand why its remains should never have been found.
The only cone-like body discovered had, as we have shown above, nothing to do with
the fructification.
