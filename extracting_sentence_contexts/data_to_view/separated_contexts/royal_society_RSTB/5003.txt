overlapping in the measurements of the widths of small and large chromosomes that all
the results have been treated together in this table, although the small chromosomes
are, on the whole, slightly narrower than the large ones. Possibly they are slightly
deformed, due to the fact that the univalents of the smaller bivalents are already separated
and lie along the length of the spindle at the stage when the larger bivalents lie with their
univalent segments in the equatorial plate. From Table VIT the following results emerge :â€”

(1) The width of the univalent chromosome at heterotypic metaphase shows a range of
variation, but the most frequent width is 1-5y to 2-Oy, and all the average values for the
width lie between the limits 1-4y. and 2-1p.
