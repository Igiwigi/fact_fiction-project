£ remarkable band of continuous spectrum shown by the prominences and lower
= chromosphere, beginning near the end of the tabulated series and extending indefi-
& nitely towards the more refrangible end of the spectrum. The interspaces between
8 the hydrogen lines are quite clear of this continuous spectrum, which begins abruptly
§ at about 3668. (See Plate 12.)
E It seems probable that this faint spectrum may be itself due to hydrogen. In
& the absorption spectrum of white stars of Type L, Sir Winntam Hucaerns: has
observed an analogous feature. This consists in the “rather sudden fall of intensity
of the continuous spectrum at about the place of the end of the series of dark hydrogen
lines. The enfeebled spectrum continues to run on without further enfeeblement
until it is stopped by the absorption of our atmosphere.”*
This seems clearly to be the absorption effect of the matter giving the faint con-
tinuous spectrum in my plates, and the fact that the feature is characteristic of white
stars in which the hydrogen absorption is very strong points to its being due to

hydrogen itself.
