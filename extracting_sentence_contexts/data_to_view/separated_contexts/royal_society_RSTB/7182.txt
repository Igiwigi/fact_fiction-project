The hypoproct also arises from a new
proliferative area behind the caecus invagination. (c) Development in the pupa
(i) The primary reproductive system

The following facts can be ascertained by following the development of the ovary in
the pupa:

(1) The ovary has been continuously extending, mostly towards the anterior segments
along the line of the terminal filament. In the old pupa it reaches to the fifth abdominal
segment anteriorly and to the middle of the seventh segment posteriorly. (2) The ova have arranged themselves around a central tube, which is formed by the
compact arrangement of previously scattered follicular cells.
