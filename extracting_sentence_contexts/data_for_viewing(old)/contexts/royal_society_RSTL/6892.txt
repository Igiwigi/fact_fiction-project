14 MR. T. A. HIRST ON THE VOLUMES OF PEDAL SURFACES.

<« The primitive curye being closed, but otherwise perfectly arbitrary, the locus of the

origins of pedals of constant area is a circle. The seyeral circular loci, corresponding to
different areas, are concentric, and their common centre is the origin of the pedal of
minimum area.” '

STEINER signalizes, as a very remarkable mechanical property of this common centre,
the fact that it always coincides with the Krimmungs-Schwerpunct of the primitive
curye,—that is to say, with the centre of gravity of that primitive, regarded as a material
curye whose density is everywhere proportional to the curyature.

In 1854, sisxteen years after the appearance of STEINER's memoir, Professor RAaBg of
Ziirich® extended STEINER's theorem 80 as to embrace the pedals of unclosed curves.
The general definition of the area of a pedal being the space swept by the perpendicular
as the point of contact of the tangent describes the primitive arc, Raapn found that © the
origins of all pedals of the same area lie on a conic.” The seyeral quadric loci, corre-
sponding to different areas, are concentric and co-axal; their common centre is again
the origin of the pedal of least area; and though it no longer coincides with the
Krimmungs-Schwerpunct of the primitive arc, it is intimately connected therewith, as
has been more recently 8hown by Dr. Werzz1G of Leipzigt.
