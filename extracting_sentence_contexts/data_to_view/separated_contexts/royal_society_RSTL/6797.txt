Of the resisting-powers of material under the severe treatment of a continuous change
of strain, such as that which the axles of carriages and locomotive engines undergo
when rolling oyer iron-jointed rails and rough roads, we are very imperfectly informed. MDCCCLXIV, 2v


312 DR. FAIRBAIRN ON THE EFFECT OF IMPACT, VIBRATORY ACTION,

Few facts are known, and very few experiments have been made bearing directly on the
Solution of this question. It has been assumed, probably not without reason, that wrought
iron of the best and toughest quality assumes a crystalline structure when subjected to
long and continuous vibrationâ€”that its cohesive powers are much deteriorated, and it
becomes brittle, and liable to break with a force considerably less than that to which
it had been previously subjected. This is not improbable; but we are apparently yet
ignorant of the causes of this change, and the precise conditions under which it occurs.
