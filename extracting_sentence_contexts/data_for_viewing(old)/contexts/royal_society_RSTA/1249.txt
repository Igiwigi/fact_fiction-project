positive constants Do ;,D1,;, D2,;, D3; such that (3.38) can be written as

In particular, we immediately see that t+» M2(t) is bounded on [0, tmax). Then we can use (3.39)
to proceed inductively to establish the boundedness of t +> M,(t) for any integer i (for the chosen
initial condition) and, for non-integer i > 1 we use the estimate || fli < Illy] + Wf lltuij+ay-
It remains to prove that ft» Mo(t) is bounded on [0, tmax) (in case (b)). Let us fix an integer
i> max{1,/}. Using the fact that So Hf (x, t) dx < 0 and, by (2.24),

where we denoted R(t) = J a(x)f (x, t)w;(x) dx. Hence
