Phenomenally
High blood pressure we have thus produced, if at the stage just described attempts at
gatural respiration should occur during the artificial respirations. Nevertheless, the
Erasomotor tone is gradually paralysed (just the same as when the vagi are not
Blivided) with a consequent fall of blood pressure, since at this low level 30 to
0 mm. Hg, there is no effect produced when severe intra-cranial pressure is applied,
Bhe only result in fact being to still further lower vasomotor tone. And this vaso-
Anotor tone, once lost, is not recovered from. The Respiration.—The uncertainty with regard to first principles concerning the
action of the respiratory “centre
stages of its disturbance by increase of the intra-cranial pressure.
