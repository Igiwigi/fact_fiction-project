Let us suppose J, D, L to be taken as coordinates of a point in space; when J, D, L
are 80 related that the condition G non-negative is satisfied, the point will correspond
to an equation with real coefficients, and may be termed a facultative point. But
when G is negative it will correspond to an equation of the kind alluded to in the
recent section of this paper, and there called conjugate: such a point may be termed
non-facultative. Thus the whole of space will be divided into two parts, separated by
the surface G=0, which may be termed respectively facultative and non-facultative (as
being made up of facultative or non-facultative points (©) ). It is clear that these two
portions will be exactly equal, similar, and symmetrical with regard to the axis of D;
by which I mean that, if two points be taken in any line perpendicular to the axis of D
at equal distances from that axis, one will be facultative and the other non-facultative,
as is evident from the fact that when J, L become —J, —L (K, and therefore D or
J2—128K, remaining unaltered), G is converted into —G. Thus by a semireyolution

(®) When the form is au + 5euv*+fu? 80. that L=0, the canonizant, as has been seen before, is a&v*u; the
resultant of thes two is a*d%af=a7e""f. Again, J=a*f?, K=—20*; thus the square of the resultant =4gJ K*;
80 that, if we call this resultant, which we may take as the definition of the Octodecimal Invariant I, we have
G=16P,

(®) It should be well noticed that the mere ratios B pe E- do not suffice to determine the character of the roots.

When these ratios are given, it is true that the ratios », 8, t in the reduced form are given, but according as L
is positiye or negative, the arguments u, v in ru*+81% + 15 (8upposing w to be the real linear function of x, y)
will be real or imaginary, When 9, L, D are all given absolutely, then the character of the roots is completely
