which is perceived at a given moment.

This enables the study of conscious contents by comparing
brain activity between epochs during which one stream is per-
ceived with those during which two streams are perceived.
Many studies have attempted to identify neural activity
that is associated with the percept of one or two streams
[136-139] or the perceptual transition from one to the other
[140,141] (see also [142]). The general findings from studies
examining differences between one- and two-stream percepts
are enhanced activity in posterior AC [136,138,139,143] and
the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) [143,144] during two- versus
one-stream percepts. The fact that a human intracranial study
did not find correlates of such bistable streaming percepts
(despite the high spatio-temporal resolution and broad cover-
age associated with intracranial recordings) further suggests
that they may be restricted to certain anatomical areas (pos-
terior AC and the IPS) or encoded in such a way so as to
require multivariate analysis methods to reveal them [137].
Switches between percepts during streaming have been associ-
ated with transient activity ina distributed cortical /subcortical
network including AC, thalamus, supra-marginal gyrus, insu-
lar cortex and the inferior colliculus [140,141], which may
reflect the brainâ€™s updated context about the acoustic scene
[140]. Similar response profiles have also been observed for
