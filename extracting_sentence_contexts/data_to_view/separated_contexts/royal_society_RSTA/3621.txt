13 Now if we differentiate the quadric to find its “ centre” we have n equations in
,...X,... @,, but the solutions of these, if w,,,... , were eliminated, are known
to be the “centre” h,, hy... h, Hence we require only n — q equations involving
%q4,... a, and we can put the h’s for the remaining values 7,...«, Let us take
the differentials of the quadric with regard to #,,,...,, then the resulting
equations involve none of the c's, but only the c’s. They reproduce in fact (xxxiv.). But the values of 2’,,, ... «’, found from (xxxiv.) are, we have seen, identical
with the values of (xxxii.),
