276 4H. G. CANNON ON THE FEEDING MECHANISM OF THE BRANCHIOPODA.

Towards the end of the forward movement, the hinder limb will straighten out and
swing backwards, so that the limbs will cease touching at the point of flexure but will be in
contact at the tips of the endopodites, fig. 1, inter-limb space 10-11. This will open up
the whole of the inter-limb space and suction will be general throughout its length during
the short interval until the anterior of the two limbs also commences its backstroke.

It is this fact of maximum suction towards the bases of the limbs during the greater
part of their forward stroke that is responsible for the marked movement of water
between the two rows of limbs in a vertical direction towards the mid-ventral groove—
Navumann’s “‘vertikale Transportstréme.” There would, of course, be a movement
of this type if the limbs swung forwards parallel to each other and suction were con-
sequently uniform throughout their length. The maximum suction at the base of the
limbs simply enhances this water movement.

The filter setae on the edge of the second endite and on the distal part of the basal
endite project posteriorly but, as the edge of the latter curves forwards at the base of
the limb, so the sete come to point first downwards into the food groove and then
slightly anteriorly, fig. 2, A. The set can thus be divided into two groups: the distal,
which project backwards and lie close against the median face of the basal endites of the
