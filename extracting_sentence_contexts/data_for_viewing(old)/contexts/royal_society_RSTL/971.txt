It ought to be stated here, that one of my principal reasons
for dissecting away the broad ligaments, was to ascertain


human fetus found in the ovarium. 105

whether the peritoneal foldings, within which the ovarium is
placed, rather than the membranes of the ovarium itself,
formed the covering of the tumour. The dissection, and the
drawing, prove that the latter was the case.

In order to supply as much information as possible, re-
specting a fact s0 curious and important in. itself, the only
one I believe on record, which offers such complete and au-
thentic evidence of a perfect ovario-gestation, I thought it ex-
pedient to know the internal anatomy of the tumour, and
readily acceded to Mr. BaveR's suggestion, of giving a second
view of the case, which should represent as many of its im-
portant details as could be rightly ascertained. The result
of this ulterior investigation, for which the preparation, after
having been drawn in its original state, as seen by yourself,
Mr. CL1eT, and others, was necessarily altered and cut into,
for better demonstration, is given in a second drawing of
Mr. Bavzs, of the most accurate and finished execution.
