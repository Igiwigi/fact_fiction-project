rapidly at first and was usually greater after leaving the wire cold all night. It was
nearly independent of the pressure below 200 millims. The variation of the leak
with the time can usually be represented roughly by a formula of the type
Ae~*+ Be7*+(, in which & is much greater than B,and A greater than B or C. The
term C represents the final value of the leak, which is nearly constant, but it also
falls off very slowly. The term Ae~“ represents the large leak at first, and falls to
half value in from a few seconds to 20 minutes, according to the temperature and
state of the wire. The second term falls to half value in several hours. Irregular
variations in the leak sometimes take place which make it impossible to determine «
and B exactly. Moreover, these quantities are not the same on different occasions,
but depend greatly on the previous treatment of the wire.

I think these facts indicate that the wire absorbs hydrogen in the cold, and that
part of this hydrogen is given off fairly rapidly on heating, part is given off very
slowly, and part not given off at all, even in a vacuum

If an old wire which has been heated in hydrogen for a long time is heated in air,
and then again to a very high temperature (above 1600° C.) in hydrogen, the leak is
nearly the same in hydrogen as in air. On reducing the temperature the leak
remains small for a time, but then begins to increase rapidly and after a time gets to
about the usual value for a wire in hydrogen, At first, while the leak is increasing
with the time, it falls when the temperature is raised. After further heating
the leak becomes more steady, and then always rises with the temperature. These
facts seem to show that an old wire does not absorb hydrogen above a certain
temperature, or only does so very slowly.
