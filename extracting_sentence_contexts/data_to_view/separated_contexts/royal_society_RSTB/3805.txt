K. SPENCER ON THE EVOLUTION OF THE CRETACEOUS ASTEROIDEA.

the profile view (Plate 11, figs. 9, 10) of the marginalia is very characteristic. The
early breaking down of the terminal supero-marginalia which takes place as early
as Marsupite times appears to prophesy a shorter life-history of the lineage as
compared with that of the Parkinsoni series, and, in fact, the lineage itself disappears
in the “ middle mucronata.”

Various forms of the lineage have been described by SuapEN and Spencer (45). Detailed Zonal History.—The members of the lineage can first be distinguished
from those of the Parkinsoni series in the zone of Terebratulina lata. These early
forms retain a few spine pits, the abactinal tumidity on the exterior margin of the
supero-marginalia is low (Plate 11, fig. 9), and the terminal supero-marginalia are
triangular.
