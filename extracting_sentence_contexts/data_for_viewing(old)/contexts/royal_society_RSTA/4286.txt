Our theorem 5.1 shows that all accumulation points q of approximate solutions q,,- are indeed
energetic solutions for the ERIS (Q,€,D). Thus, we conclude that the lower relaxation is also

an upper relaxation in the sense of Mielke [27]. This reveals that the two-phase model under : =
consideration is very special. In general, one should not expect that the separate relaxation is : Sy
also an upper or a lower relaxation. This can only happen if the macroscopic information kept a
in the relaxation (here the phase fraction @) is enough to characterize all relevant macroscopic aed
quantities. In [8,26], it was shown that simple laminates are sufficient to study the separate and : a
the lower relaxation. Interestingly, our method solves the question of upper relaxation even in : Sg
cases where there are microstructures that are not laminates. DN

The difficulty in the construction of MRS lies in the fact that On(t) € P, while the weak limit Ox € : z
Z in general. Similarly, for general test functions @ € Z, we have to find 6, € P with 6, — 6. This 2S

will be done by constructing hierarchical microstructures based on 6, and much finer laminates
with normal direction w, such that A(w,) = 0 (see proposition 5.2).

2. Pure and relaxed N-phase models

We start with general N-phase models and then restrict to the two-phase model as discussed in
[8], where also a detailed physical motivation in terms of separate relaxation is given. We also
refer to [26,28].
