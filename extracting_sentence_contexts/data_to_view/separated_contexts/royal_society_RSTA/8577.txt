EDDINGTON AND MR. C. DAVIDSON ON A

The sign of the results shows that the scale of the photographs is larger at Principe
than at Oxford; in fact the focus must have been set about 1-2 mm. further out
(apart from any change of length compensated by expansion of the photographic plates). As the error in focussing was probably not more than 0-5 mm., the greater part of this
shift must be due to the focal length of the lens combination increasing with temperature
more rapidly than the linear expansion of the glass. If the only difference were a change of focal length, we should have a’ =e’.
