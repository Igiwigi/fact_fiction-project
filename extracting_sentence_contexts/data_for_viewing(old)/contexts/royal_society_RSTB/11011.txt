kill other microbes [66]. Microbes can take up ecological
niches in the mucins at the interface of our gut lining, pre-
venting pathogenic microbes from invading our bodies
67,68]. Microbial occupation of ecological niches is an impor-
tant contributor to infant nutrition and health as well. Breast
milk contains oligosaccharides that cannot be digested by the
infant without microbial assistance. The microbes that can
process these oligosaccharides contribute to infant health by

elping to preventing invasion of the intestinal lining by
pathogenic microbes [69]. Most of our antibiotics have been
derived from microbial products that evolved to kill other
microbes [66]. Together, these facts suggest that multicellular
organisms may be using the innovations of benign microbes
to protect us from pathogenic microbes.

Future innovations in human medicine may be based on
harnessing microbial innovation. Stable microbial communities

have evolved mechanisms to exclude invaders [70]. We may be
able to cultivate more invasion-resistant microbiomes that have
the capacity to dynamically respond to new threats from
pathogens [71-73]. Such microbial ecosystems have the advan-
tage that they can continually evolve innovations for repelling
or destroying pathogens. This may explain why multispecies
