The
additional extension, which is considerable (i.e. at least 115°, see Appendix II),
must clearly have resulted from a deformation of some other type. The nature of this
deformation cannot be directly observed, since it is certainly below the limit of
visibility, but two alternatives suggest themselves. Molecular slipping may have
occurred, in which case a chromosome so treated will have been rather fundamentally

* Recent cytological literature on this subject has shown so much preoccupation with chiasmata
and chromosome splitting that this simple consideration of chromosome length has been largely lost
sight of. “The chromosomes continue to lengthen during pachytene, reaching their maximum at the
end of this stage when they divide” is a typical modern quotation (Darlington 1935, p. 89) yet no
significant basis of new facts seems to underlie such a change of view. For further consideration of this
