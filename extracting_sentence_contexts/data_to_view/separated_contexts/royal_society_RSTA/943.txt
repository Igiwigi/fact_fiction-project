The problem coming with ‘complexification’ is that t(Q) and #(Q) are not uniquely defined any
more. Indeed, the complex leaf £,,,-, = {H = £1,4 = €2} is now a two-dimensional surface with a
non-trivial topology. In particular, the first homology group of Lz,,.. is non-trivial and this leads
to the fact that Q can be reached from \j in many different ways, e.g. o!! (Qo) =0'2(Qo) = Q. So
we need to make sure that the choice of t; does not affect the final result of (the complex version
of) (5.1) and (5.2). Let us discuss this issue in more detail.
