the earlier days of the history of gun-cotton. Such being the case, too much stress
cannot be laid upon the fact that deviations from the prescribed process, which at first
sight may appear very trivial (snch as a slight reduction of the strength of the acids,
the neglect of proper cooling arrangements, &c.), are certain to lead to variations in the
products of manufacture affecting their explosive characters, or their permanence, or
both. In diseussing the composition of gun-cotton manufactured by Lexxk's system, T
shall have to refer to several samples of the material, produced at HHirtenberg and
at Stowmarket, which differed widely in their composition and properties from the
normal product of manufacture. I have obtained abundant and most conclusive proof
that these exceptional variations are solely ascribable to the neglect of a uniformly
strict adherence to the prescribed process of converting the cotton; and I am strongly
of opinion that their occurrence has almost always been due to the employment of
nitric acid which exhibited a fictitious specific gravity, from the presence either of
considerable quantities of peroxide of nitrogen, or of 80me other impurity (sﬆuch as
sulphuric acid). A searching examination of the ordinary products of manufacture
obtained at Waltham Abbey, where the quality of the nitric acid employed received

uniformly strict attention, has shown that, without any exception, the variations in their
compoxsition were embraced within very narrow limits.

1..—COMPOSITION OF GUN-COTTON.

The researches instituted by me into the composition of gun-cotton have been con-
ducted partly with ordinary products of manufacture, obtained from Waltham Abbey
and from the gun-cotton factories at Hirtenberg and Stowmarket, and partly with pro-
