the whitish more vivid light which is seen im-
mediately on the cusps, as the ash-coloured light reflected
from our earth on the dark limb of the moon does, when com-
pared with the solar light on its phase. This pale light
in the dark hemisphere, it must be owned, faded away to-
wards its termination, in the same manner as the solar light
did at the edge of the bright phase : but had this faint streak,
like the more vivid light, been an immediate emanation from
the sun, the gradual diminution would have been throughout
progressive in a continued proportion ; and the light in the
dark part, immediately contiguous to the points of the cusps,
must have had nearly the same degree of brightness as the points
themselves, which was by no means the case. Every circumstance, therefore, seems to evince that this
phznomenon is occasioned by a light reflected by the atmo-
sphere of Venus into the dark hemisphere of the planet, being
in some measure the light of the atmosphere itself, when illu-
minated by the rays of the sun, or, in fact, a real twilight. But this will appear still more manifest when

tions, the alternate relative appearances of the cusps of Venus
reciprocally with each other.
