As is always the case for hydrodynamic models, some further hypotheses are needed to close Ee
the above set of equations (5.6)-(5.10). A particularly interesting strategy, based on the maximum
entropy method (MEP), was used in a previous work [31] to close the set of hydrodynamic 3
equations in the presence of the sole Zeeman interaction. Unfortunately, when one adds the spinâ€” 1B
orbit interaction, the MEP does not provide any conclusive analytical results (the difficulty arises
from the fact that the spin-orbit interaction couples all the components of the velocity). However,
an intuitive closure can be found by inspecting the evolution equation (5.10) for the pressure
tensor. There, most spin-dependent terms cancel if we set

RR=ujSy and 13 = ude. (5.16)

The physical interpretation of the above equations is that the spin of a particle is simply

transported along the mean fluid velocity.
