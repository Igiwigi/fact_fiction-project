(at any rate in large part) to the alternate exhaustion and restoration of excitability
on the part of contractile tissues, the reason why continuous ganglionic stimulation
produces incipient tetanus in the case of s0me muscles and rhythmic action in the case
of others, is either wholly or partly because the irritability of the muscles in relation
to the intensity of the stimulation is greater in the former than in the latter case. If
this supposition as to differential irritability be granted, my experiments on Aurelia
prove that tetanus would result in the one case and rhythmic action in the other ; for
it will be remembered that in these experiments, if the continuous faradaic stimulation
were of somewhat more than minimal intensity, tetanus was the result, while if swch
stimulation were but of minimal intensity, the result was rhythmic action. Now, that
in the particular case of SarsiÂ« the irritability of the tonically contracting polypite
is higher than that of the rhythmically contracting bell is a matter, not of supposition,
but of observable fact ; for not only is the polypite more irritable than the bell in
response to direct stimulation of its own substance, but it is generally more 80 even
when the stimuli are applied anywhere over the excitable tissues of the bell. And
from this it is evident that the phenomena of muscular tonus, as they occur in Sarsia,
tend more in favour of the exhaustion than of the resistance theory.*

* The evidence, however, is not altogether exclusive of the resistance theory, for it is quite possible that
in addition to the high irritability of the polypite there may be conductile lines of low resistance connecting
this organ with the marginal ganglia. I entertain this 8upposition becanse, as afterwards explained in the
text, I see reason to believe that the natural 8wimming movements of S4rsia are probably in part due to an
intermittent discharge of the ganglia. I think, therefore, that in this particular case the ganglia supply
a tolerably constant stimulation to the polypite, while it is only at intervals that their energy overflows
into the bell, and that the higher degree of irritability on the part of the polypite ensures the tonic response
