SOME MARINE PLANKTON DIATOMS 29

There is also no definite correlation between the length of narrow cells and that
of broad cells derived from auxospores. Among the cells developed from auxospores
of line A there were from the beginning some longer and some shorter than the cells
by which the auxospores had been formed (fig. 28, December). The Axp.-line showed
in April an average length of cells of 147 (D cells) and 93-5, (H cells) respectively,
slightly higher values than those of line A at the same time (fig. 28); in August it was
distinctly smaller than in April.

All these facts show that there is no correlation between changes in the length and
the progressive decrease of the breadth of Ditylum. Whereas the decrease of the
diameter is determined by the structure and division process peculiar to the diatoms
there apparently exist environmental factors affecting the extent of the individual
growth in length of cells. From the slopes of the curves of fig. 28 it may be justifiable
to assume that under more constant culture conditions—i.e. controlled temperature
and light, and more frequent subculturing—the variability of the length of the cells
would be greatly reduced and the length would remain practically constant in suc-
cessive subcultures.

In spite of the variation of the length of cells in the cultures there is no doubt that
on the whole the cell volume decreased with the decrease in diameter.
