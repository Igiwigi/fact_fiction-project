YZ 29. We may of course establigh the theory of the surface from the equation
E #2+17w=0; the equation is satisfied by z=3y, w=—X%, which are the equations
S of a line meeting the line (x=0, y=0) (1) and the line (2z=0, w=0) (1V). The gene-
rating line meets also any plane section of the surface; in fact, if the equation of the
Plane of the section be «r+Py+y2+3w=0, then we have at once

@:71:2: W=d—9: I—y: a+B: —ar—Br

for the coordinates of the point of intersection, :

30. The form of the equation shows that there are on the line 1 two points, viz. the
Points (x=0, y=0, z=0) and (z=0, y=0, w=0), through each of which there passes
a pair of coincident generating lines : calling these A and B, then, if the coincident
lines through A meet the line 1' in C, and the coincident lines through B meet the line
1'in D, it is easy to 8ce that &=0, y=0, z=0, and w=0 will denote the equations of
the planes BAC, BAD, BCD, and ACD respectively.
