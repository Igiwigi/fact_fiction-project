424 DR. YELLOLY ON THE TENDENCY

been disappointed in not yet receiving returns*, it does not appear that more
than 8 operations of lithotomy occur annually among the poor of Ireland,
the whole population of which was considered, in 1821, to be about seven mil-
lions. But when we refer 5 of those cases to the-city and county of Dublin,
containing, together, a population of about 350,000, (which, from the documents
with which I have been favoured, seems to be very near the-truth,) it will be
seen how minute the proportion of calculous cases must be in the remaining
population of Ireland, when not more than 3 operations of lithotomy occur,
annually, among the poor of a, population of between six and seyen millions.

I have mentioned in my former paper, a 'suspicion, from some facts there
stated by me, that the principal occurrence of calculous diseases is in towns.
This idea is strengthened by a consideration of the lists of stone cases, for
which I have been indebted to Dr. HeapLam of Neweastle, and Mr. Eppisox of
Nottingham. In the town of Newecastle and Gateshead, calculous cases haye
occurred, within the last 30 years, in the proportion of about one for every 40,000
inhabitants ; while in the county of Northumberland, independently, together
with that part of the county of Durham which borders on the 'Tyweed, the pro-
portion, (as T have already remarked,) has only been one for 172,000 inhabitants.
â€”In the town of Nottingham, the proportion, in 48 years, has been at the rate
of one for every 67,000 inhabitants ; while in the county of Nottingham only, it
has been one for every 146,000 inhabitants.
