Second step: consider a sentence like A picture of the wall
caused the riot. A synonymous paraphrasis of this sentence
is A picture of the wall was the cause of the riot (11)a. The
latter is synonymous with (11)b:


(11)a A picture of the wall was the cause of the riot. (14)a * pro sono [molte foto la causa]. | 4 |

b The cause of the riot was a picture of the wall. (pro are many pictures the cause)
b * Ci sono [molte foto la causal. 3
Despite the fact that the sequence is the same, i.e. it is NP V (there are many pictures the cause) z
NP in either case, the two sentences have a very different c Molte foto sono [t la causa]. .
structure. Many empirical tests support this conclusion, for (many pictures are the cause)
example, the following contrast: d_ La causa sono [molte foto t].

. (the cause are many pictures)
(12)a_ Which riot do you think that a picture of the wall was

b * Which wall do you think that the cause of the riot was
a picture of t?
