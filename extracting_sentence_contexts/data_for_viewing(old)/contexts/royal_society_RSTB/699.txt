Plate 2, fig. 10, though there is less difference in the thickness of the cell-walls of the
inner and outer cells, and there is a strong disposition in many of the former to
arrange themselves in radial lines, whatever this may signify. Turning to the
prosenchymatous zone, e, we see that it has undergone a large increase of radial
thickness. What, to the naked eye, seems to represent its sharply-defined peripheral
boundary really runs nearly through its centre. Outside that line we find a further
extension of its radial rows of the square transverse sections of its prosenchymatous
cells, giving a thickness to the entire zone of 2. A conspicuous feature of this zone
is its undulating course. At numerous points, asat e’, e’, it is projected outwards at a
very acute angle, thus giving to its entire outline a crenulated aspect, the crenulations
being directed inwards ; and we further learn that at each of the projecting angles a
leaf-trace has emerged, to reach a leaf. Why this leaf-trace cannot be seen in every
one of these emergent points is easily understood by a fact of some importance to our
comprehension of conditions observable in many of those arborescent stems which are
imbedded in shales and sandstones, but retain little or no portion of their organized
structure.

* These details may appear uninteresting, if not pedantic; but they have a very important bearing
upon the problem of the growth and deyclopment of these branches.

Turning to Plate 5, fig. 7, we have a representation of one side of my stem
(C. N. 380 X) from which the original of fig. 2 was cut. The face a, # corresponds
