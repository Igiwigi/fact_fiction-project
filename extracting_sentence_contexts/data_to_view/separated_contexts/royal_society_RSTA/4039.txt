The December value of
b is invariably the smallest. The “all” and “quiet” day data for 1889-96, as
already stated, give very nearly the same mean value of b for the year, but the
“quiet” days’ value for b is much the larger of the two in winter, and the smaller in
summer. The “quiet” day data at Greenwich present a remarkable similarity to
the corresponding Kew data, as is best seen by comparing the seasonal values for b/a.
The fact, however, that the absolute values of both a and b are some 10 per cent.
higher at Greenwich than at Kew is rather suggestive of some misapprehension as to
the scale values at one or both observatories. § 9. In cases such as the present, a comparison of calculated and observed values is
useful.
