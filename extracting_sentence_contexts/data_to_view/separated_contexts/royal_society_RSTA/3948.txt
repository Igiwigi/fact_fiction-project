As a rule of thumb, calibrating into a blank real matrix is the most reliable strategy whenever
possible [62].

4. Applications

Because the validation approach based on accuracy profiles was proposed in the 1990s [46] and
the European guidelines on the performances of analytical method were issued in 2002 [31], the
studies that applied the present recommendations were published only after 2002. In fact, because
of their novelty, published applications combining these approaches in the F&F domain remain
scarce.

(a) Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry

(i) Regulated skin allergens

The present approach has been applied for the assessment of the European Norm [63], starting
from the GC-MS method published by the International Fragrance Association (IFRA) [64] and
validated by the Centre Europ√©en de Normalisation [42]. The biases and LOQs were determined
in real matrices after identification of analyte peaks by using Q values, and the method linearity
was checked. Although this method only applied to ready-to-inject samples, a variant that
includes online sample clean-up was developed for fragranced cosmetics and detergents with the
same approach and validated as a whole [61].
