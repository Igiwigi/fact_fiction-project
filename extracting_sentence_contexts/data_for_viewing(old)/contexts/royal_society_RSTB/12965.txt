repetitions than another of the same length because it reduces
down to a smaller file size when it is converted to a ZIP archive
file format. Higher values indicate both broader and more
complex patterns of exploration.

Before compression, the names of the objects chosen were
replaced with binary codes so that the string referencing each
object was of the same length. The python gzip package was then
used to output a compressed file using Lempel—Ziv compression.
Behavioural sequences that compress to a higher degree suggest
that behaviour was more repetitive, while those that are less com-
pressed suggest stronger exploratory behaviour. Importantly, the
compression measure incorporates the fact that ‘repetitive play’ 25 50 15 10.0 12.5
may be non-trivial. For instance, a child who selects objects A, B age (years)
and C in sequence ABCABCABC.... will appear maximally
random to a model that tracks only unigram statistics, as A, B and
C are equally frequent. This sequence will be very predictable to a
compression scheme, like the one we use, that can capture inter-
action dependencies. If past observations of perseveration in 0.8 =
younger children ring true in our dataset, we would expect to see
children to become less ‘sticky’ as they mature [37]. Total touches
(as reflected in the length of the list to be compressed) were regressed
out during analysis. This was done because we want to characterize
the redundancy in the pattern of exploration, not simply the rate at
which children are capable of making selections on a screen. Touch
