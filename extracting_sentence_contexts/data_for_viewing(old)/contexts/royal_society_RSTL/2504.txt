In Â«till water, that hydrostatic order, which M. Araco has 80 well illustrated as
belonging to water when reduced to a temperature under 39* Fan., has free play to
establish itself, and is not inverted by the mechanical action of a stream. When the
temperature of a body of water is under 39?, then the coldest portions of it are the
lightest, and naturally rise and float on the surface. When in a till pond the water
nearest the bottom has been cooled below the general temperature by contact with
the solid materials cooled by radiation, it is displaced by the heavier warmer water
above. Hence ice forms first on the surface by the meeting there of both the cold
of radiation and that acquired by contact with the incumbent cold atmosphere.

M. Araco's illustrations also furnish us with a satisfactory explanation of the
curious facts, that the ground-gru makes its first appearance in the more rapid and
agitated parts of the stream, and begins to show itself on the bottoms of the stiller
parts, and to accumulate there in quantity, only after a longer continuance of the
clear frosty weather. In the rapids the hydrostatic order is overturned, and the
colder, which is also the lighter, water not only mixed with the warmer below, but,
at the whirls of the greatest rapids, brought suddenly, without much mixing, into
direct contact with the bottom, cooled till lower than itself by radiation. If the
water is at the temperature of 32* Fan. it can give out no heat to the colder bottom

* There is an exception to the universality of this position, which, although rare, I have sometimes witnessed;
and as the phenomenon is in accordance with the theory of the radiation of heat from the bottom, it deserves
notice. In little ponds of a foot or two deep, dug to obtain the materials for building or agricultural purposes,
of which there are many examples in this neighbourhood, after they have been covered, owing to hard and long-
