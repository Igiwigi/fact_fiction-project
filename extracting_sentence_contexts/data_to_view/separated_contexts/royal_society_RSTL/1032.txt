But this force, enormous as it may appear, must still
fall short of the real initial force of the elastic fluid generated in
the combustion of gunpowder, before it has begun to expand ;
for it is more than probable that the barrel was in fact burst
before the generated elastic fluid had exerted all its force, or
that this fluid would have been able to have burst a barrel still
stronger than that used in the experiment. â€”But I wave these
speculations in order to hasten to more interesting and more

satisfactory investigations. Passing over in silence a consider-

260 Count RumrorD's Experiments to determine

able number of promiscuous experiments, which having nothing
particularly remarkable in their results, could throw no new
light upon the subject, I shall proceed immediately to give an
account of a regular et of experiments, undertaken with a view
to the discovery of certain determined facts, and prosecuted
with unremitting perseverance. These experiments were made by my directions under the
immediate care of Mr. RE1cHENBACH, commandant of the corps
of artificers in the Elector's military service, and of Count
Sexer?, first lieutenant in the regiment of artillery. Though I was prevented by ill health from being actually
present at all these experiments, yet being at hand, and having
every day, and almost every hour, regular reports of the pro-
gress that was made in them, and of every thing extraordinary
that happened, the experiments may be said with great truth
to have been made under my immediate direction; and as the
two gentlemen by whom I was assisted, were not only every
way qualified for such an undertaking, but had been present,
and had assisted me in a number of similar experiments which
I had myself made, they had acquired all that readiness and
dexterity in the various manipulations which are $0 useful and

necessary in experimental inquiries ; and I think I can safely 3
venture to say that the experiments may be depended upon,
It would have afforded me great satisfaction to have been able {

to say that the experiments were all made by myself; and I :
had resolved to repeat them before I made them public, parti-
cularly as there appear to have been some very extraordinary
and quite unaccountable differences in the results of those
made in different seasons of the year ; but having hitherto been
prevented by ill health, and by other avocations, from engag-
