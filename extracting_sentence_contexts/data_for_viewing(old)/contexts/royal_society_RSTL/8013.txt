corresponding station in fig. 11, this increase being due to the transposition of weights
to the extremities.

It may be well here to revert briefly to the fact that no ship having an excess of weight
over buoyancy at the extremities (as all, or nearly all, ships have) can sag throughout
her length when afloat in still water, although she may hog and not 82g. The cases of
the © Minotaur,” © Bellerophon,” and © Audacious” prove the possibility of the latter con-
dition, and no more need be said respecting it. That sagging alone cannot take place


WEIGHT AND SUPPORT IN SHIPS. 435

follows from the fact, that in a ship which sags there must be an excess of weight amid-
ships as well as at the extremities, and there must consequently be some intermediate
portions at which there is an excess of buoyancy, and at which hogging-strains will
result from the moment of the unsupported weights at the bow and stern, The curve
of moments (M M in fig. 7) for the © Victoria and Albert” illustrates these remarks; in
the fore-and-after bodies we find considerable hogging-moments, while amidships, as I
© have shown, there are sagging-strains. While sagging alone cannot take place in still
water, it may, however, occur at sea, or in exceptional positions ashore.
The various conditions of strain of ships floating in still water may, I think, be grouped
under the following types :—First, the * Minotaur” type, including the greater number of
Tvexsels, in which the weights are pretty evenly distributed, and the buoyancy is in defect
Sat the extremities only. In some vessels which might be included in this class the
*Sweight and buoyancy are equal for a considerable length of middle body ; but it will be
