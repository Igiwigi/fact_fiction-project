required by known spectrum laws. It must be remembered that the appearance of
the Em lines varies very much in relative intensity with different observers (¢/., for
instance 4604, 4460 above) that some appear early and then disappear, that others
come in after the emanation has stood for a few days, and further that the copper
electrodes, which extended the useful duration of the tubes, would probably have some
effect on the nature of the emitting sources in the gas. To account for this, the
suggestion might be thrown out that the activity of the emanation would by itself
ionize the molecules of the gas, and that especially the a-rays would ionize in a
different and more drastic way than the ordinary cathode or vacuum tube ionization.
That with time the y-rays from the active deposit might ionize in again a different
way and produce again new lines. One would expect that the self-effect—as it may
be called—is go drastic that it destroys those configurations which should give the red
spectrum analogous to that in the other gases. It is a fact, as I hope to show, that
the spectrum, so much as there is of it, is decidedly of the jar, or blue kind.

The degree of accuracy of the observations is not of the best. Royp claims an
accuracy of 0°1A. The spectrum was obtained by a concave grating of 1 metre
radius and extended from 5084 to 3005, with some additional lines by a prism
spectrograph, subject to errors of ‘5A, Warson’s lines extended from 7057 to 3867
with several new lines. His degree of accuracy is probably about the same as that of
Royp. In the following we shall treat the maximum errors as ‘2A except where lines
are only given to the nearest unit.

The extent of the spectrum observed is too restricted to expect to find more than
the §(2) and D(1) lines, and even in the case of $(2) the S, (2) and S, (2) may be in
