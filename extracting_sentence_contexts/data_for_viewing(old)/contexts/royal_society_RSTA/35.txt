Because the phase field variables are defined in terms of perfect dislocation slip directions, linear
combinations of these order parameters must be used in order to account for partials [1,6].
Hence, at a minimum, in order to model partial dislocations three phase field variables must
be active on the same glide plane (for fcc metals). These partials have a smaller Burgers vectors
than full dislocations. Thus, as another consequence, the phase field variables associated with
the passage of partial dislocations are non-integers. When leading and trailing partials cross the
same glide plane, the combined displacement corresponds to that of a full dislocation and the
appropriate phase field parameter will achieve an integer value, whereas the other two active
order parameters return to zero. Equation (2.5) will still calculate the appropriate interactions
between partial dislocation lines and between the partial dislocations and the externally applied
stress.

Conversely, for partial dislocations, equation (2.6) no longer applies. In fact, to accurately
model the stacking fault region bounded by leading and trailing partial dislocations, a better
approximation of the material y-surface must be included. To this end, we replace E°°"* above,
with the generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE), E8*°. Similar to E°°"*, E8*f also accounts for


the energy required to move the dislocation core through the crystal lattice [9-12]. However, to
enable the formation, motion, and interaction of partial dislocations in an fcc metal, this term is
formulated to account for the entire three-dimensional fcc material y-surface.

For simplicity and without loss of generality, we reduce the problem to treat dislocations
gliding on a single glide plane so that E8* becomes an explicit function of all three phase
variables ¢1,¢2, and ¢3 belonging to this plane. Essle is expressed with the following complex
