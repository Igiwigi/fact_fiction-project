&plete fence round the upper plate, and practically formed a fence which was very
Snearly perfect, being only interrupted by gaps a few millimetres wide at the, corners.
EPhe result was a slight apparent increase of resistance, but the irregularities were so
Great that no certain conclusion could be drawn except the following :—The con-
ductivity observed was almost entirely, if not entirely, in the sulphur itself, and not
gon the surface. This was further proved by removing the drying substance (phos-
‘phorus pentoxide) and blowing in a current of warm air saturated with water vapour,
gWwhen it was again noticed that no appreciable change of resistance took place. We
‘Eshall see later on that the explanation of this result lies in the fact that sulphur
Zdoes not appear to condense moisture so as to reduce its apparent resistance, as glass
Adoes. With the arrangement described the conductivity of the condensed layer was
‘osmall compared with that of the sulphur itself. This result was true whether the
quartz rods were in or out. The facts as to the conductivity of the surface of annealed
sulphur were confirmed and completed at a later time.
= With respect to the tests of specific inductive capacity and residual charge, we
éwill only state that by a comparison of this film with a bit of specially-prepared
“mica, we observed, for the first time, that striking absence of residual effect which
gwill be described when we deal with a film free from the objections we have raised
gto this one.
3 It now became clear that we must reduce the electric stress on the sulphur if we
desired tu be free from the risks of breaking the film. Consequently a number
got films were prepared during February, 1891, some soluble, some a mixture of
soluble and insoluble sulphur, and these were tested with lower voltages. In one
case the film was cooled by carbon dioxide snow. All these films went wrong. Ina
very thin one the plates were found to touch at one corner. One insoluble film was
