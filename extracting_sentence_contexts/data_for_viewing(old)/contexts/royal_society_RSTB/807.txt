and need only note that there is no want of accordance between our cardiometer and
myocardiographic curves, with regard to the effect of the vagus nerve on the degree
of diastolic expansion of the ventricles.

As we have noticed above, the very great increase in the contraction-volume of the
ventricles is accompanied, and rendered possible, by relatively still greater diastolic
expansion. How is this great ventricular distension produced? As the curves of
Figs. 7 to 12 show, it is not due to one of the factors, viz., the auricular contractions,
by which the ventricles are usually distended. The auricles are either weakened or
arrested, as we have seen, by vagus action. We can, therefore, say that the diastolic
expansion in question takes place in spite of the fact that the auricles are weakened.

Is it due, as Frangois-Franck, McWit1am, and others have asserted, to a
diminution of the tonus of the relaxed ventricular walls? In coming to this
conclusion these observers omitted to take into consideration one important factor,
viz., the intra-ventricular pressure during diastole. It can only be assumed that the
tonus, or elasticity as we prefer to call it, of the ventricular walls, has diminished or
increased as the case may be, if it can be shown that the degree of expansion of the
ventricles has increased or diminished without any corresponding change in the
distending force. Now the auricular contractions are not the only cause of the
diastolic filling of the ventricles. A rise in the pressure of blood in the large veins
may have even more effect than changes in the force of the auricular beats. In the
case of the thin-walled, extremely distensible right ventricle, any change in the
