delays the commencement of the excitatory change following direct electrical exci |
tion of the organ.* A glance at the curves given in Plate 51 at the end of this treatise
shows how completely cold separates the induction shock from the subsequent
response, and how warming brings the two galvanometric effects together; the
interval of time which elapses between the two is the “ period of delay” or “ latent
period” and is at its shortest, z.e., at 20° C., more than "0025". However favourable
the conditions, with transmission time excluded by the method of experiment, it
would therefore appear that there is an interval of time between excitation and
response. This interval may be regarded as the sum of the time necessary for the
establishment of the excitatory process in the nerves plus that necessary for the
development of those chemical changes in the protoplasm of the organ which may lie
at the bottom of the obvious electromotive effect. It has been previously pointed
out that in the case of the nerve organ preparation the fact that changes in the
temperature of the organ affect the length of this period would seem to require the
existence of this second factor, for, under the most favourable circumstances and after
deducting the time occupied in nerve transmission, there remained an interval of
4/1000” between excitation of the nerve trunk and the response of the organ. In the
present experiments the earliest effect was observed with a closure of from *0025”
to 005”; and, as the conditions of these experiments excluded loss of time due to
nerve transmission, the existence of a period of delay must be regarded as certain.

Although the passage of an induced current through the columns of the electrical
organ evokes an excitatory response of the tissue, it is, however, doubtful if the
expression “ direct ” excitation is a strictly correct one as applied to this phenomenon,
In the case of muscle there exists a method (curarisation) by which the nervous
