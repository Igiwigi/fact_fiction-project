These boundary conditions for various structures are discussed, for example, in [6,32]. [3

For the most general linear metasurfaces (with magnetoelectric coupling), it is appropriate to :

In the general case, the matrix elements in (3.2) have no clear physical meaning as effective [=
surface parameters. This dyadic impedance model (3.4) can be used, in fact, for arbitrary linear Dk
planar layers which are homogeneous in the layer plane, for example [14]. Sometimes, it is more .
convenient to rewrite these relations expressing the fields on one side as linear functions of the
fields on the other side of the surface. The corresponding matrix is called the transntission matrix.

A useful classification of metasurfaces can be established considering their fundamental
response to excitation by normally incident plane electromagnetic waves. The presence of one
or both surface currents and the relations between them and the fields define the basic types of
metasurfaces.
