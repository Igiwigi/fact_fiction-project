of our knowledge, it would be useless to attempt to speculate
on the remote cause of the electrical energy, or the reason
why different bodies, after being brought into contact, should
be found differently electrified ; its relation to chemical affinity
is, however, sufficiently evident. May it not be identical with
it, and an essential property of matter ?

The coated glass. plates of Beocaria,strongly adhere to
each other when oppositely charged, /and retain their charges
on being separated. This fact affords a distinct analogy to the
subject ; different particles 'in combining must still be sup-
posed to preserve their peculiar states of energy.

In the present early stage of the investigation, it would be
improper to place' unbounded confidence in this hypothesis ;
but it seems naturally to arise from the facts,-and to coincide
with the laws of affinity, s0 ably, developed by modern
chemists; and - the general application, of it may be easily
made. 4

Supposing two bodies, the particles of which are in different
electrical states, and. those states sufficiently exalted to give
