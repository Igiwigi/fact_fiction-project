evidence refers to Scotland. Since the year 1855 the Registrar-General for that
country has published the monthly number of deaths from measles for each of the
eight chief towns. These have been investigated for Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee,
Perth, and Paisley. Additional information for the first of these is furnished in
Dr. Wart’s celebrated ‘ Treatise on the Chincough,’ for the years between 1780 and
1820. The monthly numbers of deaths from measles for the last 30 years have also
been extracted from the statistics of Paris. No attempt has been made to examine
all the existing periods. In all these cases the amplitude of one particular period so
greatly exceeds the amplitude of any other that this special period must be considered
predominant.

When the statistics of these different localities are examined, it is found that in
nearly every case a different epidemic periodicity exists, a fact that must be con-
sidered of fundamental importance. The shortest period found is that existing in
Paris during the last 30 years, which is accurately, or almost accurately, that of the
solar year. No other period has been discovered to exist in these statistics. As
the figures for this city have not been published in either of my previous papers they
are added in Table IV. Nearest to this period in duration is that found for the
city of Glasgow between the years 1773 and 1806, a period of very nearly 67°3 weeks.
Closely associated in length is the epidemic periodicity found to obtain in Perth
between the years of 1871 and 1911, which amounts to almost exactly 69°3 weeks.
Both of these latter periods are shorter than any observed in London, except during
the first epoch. Following these periods in duration, though the significance of the
figures is not quite clear, is the 78-week period found present in Dundee between the
years 1856 and 1873. The amplitude of this period is very large, amounting to about
