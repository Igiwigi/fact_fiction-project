fluctuations (n=&=0) is given in figure la. For a range of values of the
rreshwater forcing parameter 0<p<0.25, the idealized model admits three
steady states. Two of these steady states are stable, y; and y_, with weak
(strong) overturning circulations and strong (weak) interbox density differences,
respectively. The third steady state yo is unstable. This interval of bistability is
younded by fold bifurcations, beyond which only a single steady-state solution
exists. If the parameter mu is increased from below the lower bifurcation point to
above the upper bifurcation point and then decreased again to below the lower
vifurcation, the hysteresis loop displayed in figure 1b,c is traced out. Because the
steady states are equilibrium solutions, deterministic transitions between
solution branches for an evolving freshwater forcing u(t) will generally occur
somewhat beyond the bifurcation point; that is, there will be a slight overshoot
(e.g. Berglund & Gentz 2006). The fact that three-dimensional coupled ocean—
atmosphere models produce analogous hysteresis structures (e.g. Weaver &
Hughes 1994; Rahmstorf et al. 2005; Kuhlbrodt et al. 2007) suggests that this
AMOC model captures the essential physics of the advective feedback bistability
(although its predictions cannot be expected to be quantitatively meaningful).

In the absence of climate noise, the AMOC regime transitions can only occur if
u is moved beyond one of the fold bifurcations. However, in the presence of noise,
spontaneous transitions between regimes can occur within the region of bistability;
if the noise is unbounded (as with Gaussian fluctuations), then transitions are
possible everywhere that both states exist. For 7 and € white noise processes, the
mean transition time from y— to y+ can be computed analytically (e.g. Cessi 1994;
Monahan 2002a) and takes the form t(y_— y,) ~ exp(—V(y_, yo) /”), where ¥ is
