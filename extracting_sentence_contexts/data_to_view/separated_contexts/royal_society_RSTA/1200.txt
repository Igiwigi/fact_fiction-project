Note that /71|p™ is the spectral projection
onto the eigenspace ker(I — K) along ran(I — K) while P is a projection onto the finite-dimensional
subspace R” Cc L1(G). Here and in the following, R” is considered either as linear space (R”, ||-Il,)
or as a linear subspace of (L1G), Il L1)), that is the subspace of the edge-wise constant functions
on the graph, which does not cause an ambiguity. In the following results, we shall use the facts that K is contractive and 4 = 1 is its semisimple
eigenvalue, see [49, eqn. (17), Rem. 1]. For the considered biological model, they are naturally
satisfied. Theorem 4.1 ([49, Cor. 1&3, Thm. 4.1]).
