divisions of the ship represensed by the ordinates P P, PP; hence it follows that there
should be cusps in the curve IH H at those ordinates. Between those ordinates the curye
is nearly straight, as the armour on the ship's sides is of about uniform weight for the
length of the battery, and the weight of hull per foot of length is also nearly uniform.
Before and abaft the central battery the armour-belt only reaches to the main deck
(except in wake of the armoured bow-battery), and its weight per foot of length of the
ship is considerably less than it is in wake of the central battery ; this reduction, in com-
bination with the gradual Zineing of the vessel, leads to the form of curve shown in the
diagram.

It will be remembered that IT have already intimated that the graphical method of
representation adopted in this paper is not minutely accurate; and the case just consi-
dered being an extreme one, affords an excellent opportunity for illustrating this fact,
and showing the extent of the error thus introduced. From the description of the
method given above, it will be obvious that we have assumed spaces bounded by curves,
which are practically continuous, to be graphic representations of the distribution of the
weight and buoyancy. The assumption is fairly accurate for most of the divisions,
especially in the case of the curve of buoyancy ; but it is not nearly exact for the curve
of weight in some parts of a ship, particularly where there are any great weights con-
centrated in a very small length. The transverse armoured bulk-heads enclosing the
central battery of the * Bellerophon* are each really concentrated in a space, measured
fore and aft, of less than 2 feet; and it is obvious that, by spreading the weight over the
20-feet division in which such a bulk-head comes, we materially modify the distribution,
and obtain an inaccurate curve of weight, even when we make some allowance for the
bulk-heads, as is done in the cusps P, P in fig. 3. If we place the planes of division 18
