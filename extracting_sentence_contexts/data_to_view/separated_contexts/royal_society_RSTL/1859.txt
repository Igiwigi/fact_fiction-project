A comparison with those of the other Trochi
leaves little doubt that they are all formed and increase in size on the same
principle. The disk on the back of the foot of the animal to which the operculum is
attached, shows three very distinct parts, viz. 1st, the muscle by which the
operculum is affixed, which is semilunar, and occupies nearly the whole of
the anterior half of the disk, having its hinder edge thin and membrana-
ceous; 2ndly, an elongated triangular fleshy band, on the right side of its an-
terior part, which is separated from the muscle by a deep groove; and 3rdly,
the back part of the foot, which is raised to the level of the muscle by an
elevated border, attached in front to the membranes placed along the sides
of the body of the animal, and is marked with minute concentric wrinkles,
originating round a longitudinal fissure on its hinder edge, and becoming more
and more transyerse as they approach nearer to the muscle, This part of the
disk merely forms a bed for the operculum to lie upon, without any attachment ;
it is semicircular, and is prolonged into a narrow process extending up the right

occupies nearly the anterior half of the operculum : 2ndly, on the left of the
sear (that is, when the operculum is turned with its inner side towards the ob-
server,) a triangular pale brown spot, occupying the margin of the extremity,
and eas portion of the last yolution : and 3rdly, a black and polished
posterior portion. There can be no doubt, as these divisions of the operculum agree in shape
with the three parts obseryed in the disk, that they are seyerally deposited by
them; and on further examination it appears that the volutions are in fact
formed of three coats, each deposited by one of these parts. The new layers
are first added to the extremity of the whorls by the small triangular fleshy
band placed on the right side of the muscle. Afterwards, as the operculum
is movyed round in order to present a new end to the influence of the fleshy
band, the newly formed part is covered by a black coat, secreted by the pro-
cess of the back of the foot which extends up the right side of the band.
