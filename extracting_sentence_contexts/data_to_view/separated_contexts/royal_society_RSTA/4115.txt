The average sire of colts is lighter than the average sire of fillies ; the average
dam of colts is darker than the average dam of fillies. Now these conclusions seem to indicate that the older horse was lighter in coat, and
the older mare darker in coat than either the colt or filly of to-day, and that there isa
tendency in the thoroughbred racehorse of to-day to approach to an equality of colour
in the two sexes, an equality which is a blend of the sensibly divergent sex-colour of
the older generation. Whether this secular change is due to the “ breeding out” of the influence of light
Arabian sires, or to a tendency in the past to select light-coloured sires and dark-
coloured mares for breeding, or to the fact that such coloured sires and mares are the
most fertile, 7.e., to an indirect effect of reproductive selection, is not so easy to
determine. But what does appear certain is that the average thoroughbred is
approaching to a blend between its male and female ancestry, which were sensibly
divergent. *
