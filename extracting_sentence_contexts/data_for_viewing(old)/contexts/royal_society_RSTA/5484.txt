his makes serious assessment of numerical modelling extremely difficult. Also,
for jets with co-flow, it seems to have taken a surprisingly long time for the
sensitivity of the flow-to-inflow concentricity to come to light. This must be due
o experimentalists restricting measurements to just one plane and erroneously
aking axisymmetric flow for granted. This is also, in a sense, reminiscent of
internal air systems in gas turbine aeroengines. For many years, axisymmetric
flow was assumed and complex flow instability mechanisms ignored. Impor-
antly, when wind-tunnel tests are repeated, shock locations can vary by 20% of
he wing chord. However, repeat measurements are seldom made. Hence, these
‘uncertainty data’ cannot be supplied to the CFD practitioners. In the light of
his, it seems surprising, considering the potential data scatter, that most CFD
simulations seem to capture shock location very well. The surprising level of
agreement perhaps reflects the fact that CFD is still a heavily postdictive

process. With many applications, the CFD practitioner has to make a wide range
of modelling assumptions. Through these, solution control can be exerted. This
appears especially true for the prediction of jet noise.

At perhaps a more fundamental level, it has been fairly widely assumed that the
Karman constant (x), used in Prandtl’s mixing-length expression, is universal,
