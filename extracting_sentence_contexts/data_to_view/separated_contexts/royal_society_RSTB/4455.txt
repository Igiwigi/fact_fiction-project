In Benepicr and CatTucartâ€™s experiments a
low respiratory quotient was also observed after exercise, and this was in some cases
found to persist for as much as several hours. It is therefore far from probable that the sole cause of the low respiratory quotient

after work in these last two experiments is CO, retention, and what appears to us
more likely is that some at least of the diminution is due to the fact that when rest
is resumed proportionally less garbohydrate than fat is metabolised than in the pre-
liminary resting period owing to the depletion of carbohydrate during the work, a
suggestion which is in consonance with the views expressed by the Zuntz school and
by Benepicr and Caracarr. It is, however, rather a remarkable feature that the
fall of respiratory quotient after the stop of the work only becomes obvious in the
experiments with work of 1056 kg.m. per minute, though Experiment 6 with work of
704 kg.m.
