It was seen often in the following
years, and there are records that it probably nested in Oxford in 1938 and 1939 (Mr W. B.
Alexander, personal communication). In May 1939 it was shot a few miles from the place
of ringing. The final evidence that this type of bird is British is given by the fact that it is the only
type left when the Continental starlings leave about the middle of March. The Continental
birds are known to leave at this time from the results of ringing, from observations at light-
houses, and from the times of the birdâ€™s reappearance in the Baltic countries recorded by
Szmirnov (1929-30). The type of starling which has been distinguished as of Continental origin appears
suddenly in great numbers in Yorkshire during October and early November.
