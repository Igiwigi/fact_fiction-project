In 1907, Lynps Jones pointed out that “ the first down and its succeeding
definitive feather are produced by one continuous growth, and therefore cannot be
regarded as two distinct feathers. The first down is the plumulaceous tip of the
definitive feather.” At a cursory glance this might appear true, as invariably the protoptile is borne
on the tip of its successor for some time ; but, except in areas where the development
of the second coat is accelerated (as in the remiges of the fowl), the fact that a
definite calamus exists at the base of the protoptile, into which the distal barbs
of the second generation feather project as in the fowl, or with which they fuse as
in the duck, shows the protoptile and its successor to be distinct feathérs produced
consecutively by the same papilla. The sequence of plumage in the Brown Leghorn fowl has recently been studied by
Domo, Gustavson and Junn (1932) who describe four stages, down, chick, juvenile,
and adult ; but “ because their development is a gradual piece-meal affair, succeeding
stages are invariably intermingled before the attainment of the adult plumage”,

The chick plumage differs from the down, according to these authors, by the
precocious development of remiges and rectrices, together with a few feathers along
sides of breast and belly. Now in the Rhode Island Red and the Black Leghorn X
Light Sussex, and according to Finn (1919) in all Galli, the remiges are developed
on hatching, and breast and abdominal feathers appear later.
