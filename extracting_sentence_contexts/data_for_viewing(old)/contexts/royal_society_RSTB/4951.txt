set in one of these radiation incubators were turned by handâ€”half every three hours
and the rest twice a day; and of this the hatching indicates that when the more
frequently turned eggs are turned by hand instead of by motor the drop in the hatching
percentage met with in every other instance with these incubators becomes a rise ;
and though the number of eggs set was too small for the result to possess much value
numerically, it shows that when the effect of the motor is eliminated the top-warmed
eggs fall into line with those hatched in hot-air machines.

As the experiments with motor-turned eggs have thus all to be ruled out, it would
perhaps have been sufficient to dismiss them with less discussion. But the work of
searching for the cause of the discrepancy had to be done, and for the sake of other
possible experimenters on the same lines, it seemed more useful to enter into this much
detail in describing it. Moreover, though the explanation given does fit the facts,
it remains a surprising thing that a vibration of which so little direct evidence is avail-
able, and which is only applied for a few seconds at a time, should be capable of doing
so much damage to a hatch.

Motor-turning having failed, the experiments had to be completed by hand-turning.
Two new 70-egg Gloucester incubators were therefore set up close to the writer's
bedroom, so that the turning might be continued through the night by the help of an
alarum, The egg trays of this machine are fitted with seven turning tapes, each carrying
ten eggs, which are normally operated together by a frame connecting them. These were
removed, and seven separate tapes, each arranged as an endless band, put in their place.
Hach tape could thus be operated independently of the rest ; and from below, so that
