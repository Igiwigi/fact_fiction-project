W. E. AGAR: EXPERIMENTS ON INHERITANCE IN PARTHENOGENESIS.

(2) Length of Antenna.—This measurement presented some troublesome features,
I was unable to measure the antenne directly, as WARREN found possible for
Hyalopterus, owing to the fact that they have a curvature both in the horizontal and
vertical planes. The vertical curve was flattened out by dissecting off the head, with
the antennz attached, and placing it ona flat slide and covering with a cover-slip, The
weight of this was sufficient to flatten out the antenna without crushing it. The
curvature in the horizontal plane still prevented direct measurement, so the antenna
was now drawn under the camera lucida, and the curved line so obtained measured
with an ordinary map measurer.
