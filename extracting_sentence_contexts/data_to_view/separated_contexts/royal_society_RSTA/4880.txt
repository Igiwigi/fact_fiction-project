The
period of these displacements would be 1/E sidereal days, and a knowledge of it would
enable us to determine E, a quantity which depends on the form of the internal
surface and the thiokness of the crust. The oscillations which correspond to the root \ = w/{(«, + Gq) («2 + Ge)}
would manifest themselves in a different manner. They are, in fact, similar to. the
“Kulerian” nutation (vide TisseRAND, ‘ Mécanique Céleste,’ vol. 2, p. 494), and will
involve a small periodic change in the latitude of places on the Earth’s surface, as
found by meridian observations of a circumpolar star, this change taking place in a
period of {(«, + ge)
