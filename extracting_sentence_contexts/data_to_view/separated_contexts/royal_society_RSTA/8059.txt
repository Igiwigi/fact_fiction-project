The lower one is introduced through a rubber bung fitting in a hole cut to the
same taper and held in place by a brass plate screwed down on to its outer end. The
bath is filled with distilled water which is circulated by a screw propeller mounted in
ball-bearings and running at a speed of from 1500 to 2000 r.p.m. in the bore of the
étalon. Since the diameter of the screw is limited by the fact that the internal diameter
of the étalon is only just over 4 cm., care was taken to secure as good conditions as
possible for the flow of water. As a result of suggestions made by the William Froude
Laboratory, the screw itself was copied from a model of a ship’s propeller and the ends of
the bath were faired off so as to minimise loss of energy caused by the formation of eddies. It will be noted that no provision has been made for temperature regulation in the
