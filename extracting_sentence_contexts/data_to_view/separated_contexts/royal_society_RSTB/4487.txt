In the two succeeding pairs of legs (fig. 8), the episterna
are much less chitinised and more intimately related with their corresponding limbs. The epimera are very large, sub-triangular in form, and, curving upwards and outwards,
project dorsally on either side of the tergal shields of their respective segments
(figs. 1 and 8). That these elements have no relation to wing vestiges, notwith-
standing their appearance, is obvious from the fact that they are present on the
prothoracic segment and are, moreover, recognisable in the winged forms also. The
meron is a large and conspicuous component of the coxa, and has the appearance of

being a flattened wing-like outgrowth of the latter. Placed between the sternum
and episternum is a separate sclerite or laterosternite.
