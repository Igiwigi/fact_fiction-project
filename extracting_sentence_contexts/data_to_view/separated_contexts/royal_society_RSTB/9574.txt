The presence
of a lag phase is clear evidence that transport of the pre-
protein through the channel is rate limiting for translocation:
if initiation were the slowest step, no such lag would be
observed. By contrast, an independent study found no
evidence of a lag phase and suggested instead a single
rate-limiting step for the entire translocation process [71]. These results can best be reconciled by the fact that PMF
was absent in the former experiments, but present for the
latter. As PMF profoundly stimulates the later stages of trans-
location [68], it could well be that initiation is rate limiting
only in its presence. A recent kinetic analysis followed up these results using
substrates where processive translocation was slowed by
stretches of poly-lysine [72].
