IN CONNEXION WITH THE SPECTRUM OF THE SUN. 647

dearly transparent and fusible to the end, and evolyes chlorine when treated for that
purpose.

Strontic Fluoride was the most stable of all ; it would not fuse, gave no coloration to
the flame, and obstinately retained its fluorine to the last, as was shown by the mass
giving the usual reaction of fluorine when treated on a glass plate with sulphuric acid.

CONCLUSION...
These facts justify us in coming to the conclusion that the similarity of the spectra
observed under the conditions in question is due to the fact that the spectram observed
18 that of the oxide; for whereas in the first instance there is a differentiation between
Sthe various spectra, after the action of the flame has been continued for some little time
Â© the spectra observed are the same.
