Violating the assumption that a molecule is always in a well-defined state (as in ‘state
switching’) can be exploited: as described in [8], Rabi oscillations between molecular states can
be used to cause the wanted nonlinear relationship between excitation and emission. There is
clearly no ‘switching of states’ involved in such a situation, which clarifies why in my view ‘state
switching’ does not constitute a common basis or prerequisite for superresolution. Yet, the fact that fluorescence comes in discrete quantities, molecules and molecular states and
switching between them, is something that is clearly exploited in single-molecule localization
methods (SMLM). But in SMLM the purpose of switching is separation, to be able to assign
many emitted photons to the same entity, i.e. to separate individual emitters [24]. In SMLM and
MINFLUx, the superresolution comes from the fact that multiple detection events (or also ‘not-
detection’ events in the case of MINFLUX) can be assigned to the same entity (molecule) with
(hopefully) still the same position.
