and the following organisms were discovered in the trophic condition on the films so

prepared :—
1. Euglypha, ? sp. (Plate 5, fig. 1). 5. Flagellate, ? gen. (Plate 5, fig. 3).
2. Trinema, ? sp. 6. Chilodon sp. (Plate 5, fig. 2).

3. Vahlkampfia soli, n. sp. (Plate 5, fig. 10). 7. Ciliate, ? gen.
4. Amaba cucumis, n. sp. (Plate 6, fig. 20). 8. Ciliate, ? gen.

Of these the thecamcebze were probably present in this soil in considerable numbers,
more than is indicated by the number of forms obtained on the films.

This is probably due to the fact that under the most favourable circumstances it is
rather difficult to get good preparations of these thecamoebee from a numerical point
of view by the cover-slip method.

The Amoebe were present on the films in large numbers, ¢.g., up to 150 good

specimens in an active trophic condition, with large numbers of ingested bacteria,
were counted on a single film. These were probably the dominant protozoa in this
soil during the time it was under examination,
