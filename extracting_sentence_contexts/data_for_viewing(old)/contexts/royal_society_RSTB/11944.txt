Figure 3. Sources of phenotypic variation according to the inclusive evol-
utionary synthesis. Legend as in figure 2. The wide triangle expanding
thousands of generations in the past depicts the effect of non-genetically
inherited adaptations to new environmental characteristics that ancestors
acquired and transferred to their descendants. On its far left end, its
colour blends into the light blue colour (representing genetic information)
to illustrate the fact that at such long timescales non-genetic processes
may become encoded into the DNA sequence in a form of epigenetically-
facilitated mutational genetic assimilation [19]. Parent—offspring resem-
blance thus involves a variety of processes of transfer of information across
generations all participating in heredity. Brief examples of the reality of
inheritance of acquired adaptations are provided in the text and boxes 2—

iance; Vyyc, transmitted non-genetic variance; V;, transmitted variation, whatever
the mechanism of transmission; V¢, genetic variance. (Online version in colour.)

neurons. The resulting information is then processed by the
organism. This processing can take many different forms.
In organisms with brains (figure 4), this processing probably
