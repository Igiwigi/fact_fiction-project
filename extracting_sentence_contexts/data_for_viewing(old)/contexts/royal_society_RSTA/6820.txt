and the number of times per second that the rate of change of the deflexion with respect to
time becomes zero, say N,, is given by

In both cases dashes denote differentiation with respect to 7.

Some doubt has been cast on the general validity of these results: Uhlenbeck, quoted by
Rice (1945), has pointed out that, for a suspended mirror, the above result makes N, in-
dependent of the damping, i.e. of the pressure of the surrounding gas, whereas Kappler’s
(1931) records of the motion of a suspended mirror vary markedly in character with the
pressure. It is not, however, possible actually to assess V, from Kappler’s published records.
The fact that we have obtained very satisfactory verification of Rice’s formulae in the closely
related case of the galvanometer amplifier may, therefore, be of some interest.

Using the expression obtained in the above paper, equation (69), for the autocorrelation
function of the fluctuations of the galvanometer amplifier, Rice’s results become
