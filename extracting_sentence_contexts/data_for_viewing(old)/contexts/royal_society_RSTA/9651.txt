result of this calculation, however, there will remain several important features of the
phenomenon which require explanation—in particular, the seasonal changes. By
the elucidation of these difficulties, terrestrial magnetism may throw light on the
ionization of the upper atmosphere. The variables at disposal in the theory are,
unluckily, too numerous to get very definite knowledge of any one of them from a
single source, and therefore it is peculiarly fortunate that there is a kindred but
independent set of phenomena, produced by the moon jointly with the sun, which
promises very valuably to supplement the knowledge furnished by the solar diurnal
variations. It should be specially instructive to compare the seasonal changes of the
two sets of phenomena.

§2. The general outlines of this paper may be briefly indicated here. The principal
known facts regarding the lunar magnetic variation are first summarized, and it is
shown that, so far as they go, they seem most easily explicable in the manner
proposed by Scuusrer for the solar diurnal variations. Nothing in the nature of a
proof is yet possible however. Some new facts, deduced by harmonic analysis of
existing material for the lunar variation at the separate phases of the moon, are then
described, and it is pointed out how they confirm the hypothesis of the variable
conductivity of the atmosphere in a very direct way, and provide a powerful means
of quantitatively investigating the changes of the conductivity. The details of the
calculation of these new harmonic terms in the lunar variation, and the actual tables
of results, are collected in Part III. of the paper. In order to discuss the bearing of
these observational results on the theory, it is necessary to extend ScuusrEr’s
calculation of the effect of an atmospheric oscillation, under the influence of the
earth’s radial magnetic forces and the variable conductivity of the air, in producing
