Above this crease, traces of barbs are to be seen among the inter-
mediate cells of the second papilla. These never form true barbs, although they
cornify and become separated from the rest of the epidermis, figs. 48-50, Plates 26-27. The curvature of the whole follicle is well illustrated by the fact that in these serial
transverse sections, both first and second, and finally all three papillae are present
in the same section, for a certain distance down the follicle. Near the base, the
second and third papillae are completely separated by dermal tissue. This is fore-
shadowed in fig. 51, Plate 27, where the proximal and distal parts of the follicle are
separated by intermediate cells.
