Then the origami structure
analogous to an objective molecular structure is the set of deformations yj,..., yj, defined as
above, such that for each x € T and each z € R there is an orthogonal tensor Q; depending on x

For typical origami structures, we would also impose the continuity and invertibility (if S
possible) of y. Also, for classic origami y is piecewise rigid, but this need not be the case. : gS
The definitions (1.1)-(1.3) are not so convenient for the design of structures or molecules. In : 3
fact, they imply a more useful underlying group structure. We first observe that real atomistic ‘2

structures are discrete, and we add this to the definition of an objective structure: the structure
contains no accumulation points. We consider an objective molecular structure S defined by (1.2).
