XXV. Some Remarks in reply to Dr. DauBexy's Note on the Air disengaged from the
Sea over the Site of the recent Volcano in the Mediterranean. By Joax Davy,
M.D. F.R.S. Assistant Inspector of Army Hospitals.

IN the second part of the last volume of the Philosophical Transactions, at the re-
quest of the Council of the Royal Society, Dr. Dausexy has stated his objections to
the explanation which I have proposed of the origin of the air disengaged over the
sunken remains of the volcano of 1831, as described in my last paper on the subject *.

I am induced to reply to these objections on the ground that they do not appear to
me well founded, nor compatible with the facts which I have brought forward.

In the paper alluded to, after having noticed the composition of the air, which I
had found to consist of about 80 per cent. azote and 10 oxygen, I remarked that two
views might be taken of its origin ; one, that it was of yolcanic source ; the other, that
it was derived from the sea water, and merely disengaged by the heat of the volcano.

The first view, that which Dr. Dausexy adyocates, I could not adopt, as it appeared
to me least probable. The minuteness of the quantity of air obseryed in its ascent by
Captain SwiNBURNE, rising © in small silyer threads of bubbles,” (this is his expres-
$i0n,) scemed very unfavourable to the idea of a deep volcanic source ; and the ad-
mixture of oxygen with the azote seemed to me to demonstrate that its source could
not be deep. For the sake of argument, let us suppose, with Dr. DauBexy, that the
