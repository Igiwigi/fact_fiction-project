the spectra of potassium, sodium, and manganese.

Immediately the carbon is burnt out of the iron the flame drops to about one-sixth
of its height ; its luminosity also diminishes, and the quantity of fume increases.
There can be no considerable variation in the temperature of the fluid charge during
the few moments in which this great change takes place; the gases will therefore
leave the converter at about the same temperature throughout this time.

It is probable that the impurities in the iron are oxidised chiefly by secondary
reactions, but a portion of them is oxidised directly by the oxygen of the air. The
volume of the iron in the converter is very much greater than the volume of the
manganese, and yet almost the whole of the latter is oxidised and passes into the
slag in the first few minutes of the “blow.” The fact that the flame maintains its
size until the sudden drop confirms this hypothesis. If this hypothesis is true the

greater portion of the oxygen of the air enters into combination with iron, forming
magnetic oxide of iron which is probably reduced to a lower oxide. This oxide of
iron will be reduced to the metal by the silicon, manganese, and carbon present in the
iron, and by the phosphorus or ferrous phosphide in presence of the lime in the order
stated, and if the time of oxidation were extended indefinitely each one would be
oxidised almost completely in turn. In the converter the oxidation is so rapid that
all the reactions go on together; but the complete oxidation of each impurity is
