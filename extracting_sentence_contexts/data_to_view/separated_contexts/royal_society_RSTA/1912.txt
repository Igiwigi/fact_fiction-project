Figure 7a shows the PDF of Q, for a long inextensible chain (L = 207) with different values of Wig,
corresponding to a highly flexible (Wig = 10!),a moderately flexible (Wig = 107!) and a rod-like
inflexible (Wig = 10-5) chain. The PDF clearly does not vary with Wig, which is an unequivocal
indication that, in three dimensions, the bending stiffness has no effect on preferential sampling. This fact provides further confirmation of our explanation of preferential sampling of vortical
regions in 3D turbulence. If the main mechanism is the alignment of the chain with the axis of
the tubular structures on which vorticity concentrates, the chain does not need to coil in order

to reach and keep that configuration. It is then natural that the bending stiffness does not affect Dy
preferential sampling in three dimensions. [Ss
All our results, thus far, point to the ability of chains to thread vortex tubes and follow them : S

by aligning with the vortex axis.
