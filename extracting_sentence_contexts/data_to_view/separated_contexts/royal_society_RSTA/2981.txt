The logical independence between the two notions of causality and determinism is proved by the existence of causal
theories that are not deterministic (e.g. quantum theory), and vice versa of deterministic theories that are not causal (e.g.
the operational probabilistic theory (OPT) presented in [17]). (In a probabilistic context, ‘determinism’ is identified with the
tautological property of a theory of having all probabilities of physical events being equal to either zero or one, which is
clearly a definition with no causal connotation. Originally, the notion of determinism arose within the clockwork Universe
vision of classical mechanics, assessing that the state of a system at an initial time completely determines the state at any
later time.)

While in classical theory, the notions of causality and determinism degenerate in a conceptual overlapping, they completely
disentangle in quantum theory (and, more generally, in an OPT [13,14]). This is due to the fact that classical mechanics
identifies the state (point in the phase space) with the measurement outcome, while the two concepts are radically different in
quantum theory, and more generally in OPTS, allowing us to define determinism outside the framework of classical mechanics
which is already deterministic.


whereas causality is a purely theoretical ingredient, and, being probabilistic, it depends on prior
assumptions.*

In the next section, we will see how causality is a theorem of quantum theory, and, as such,
is a falsifiable proposition of the theory. We will also see how the present notion of causality
is equivalent to the Einsteinian notion, and distils all the guises in which causality appears
in physics.

Quantum theory is an OPT [15].
