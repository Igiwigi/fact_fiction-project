T; > 3) appear to suggest. The
spectroscopic classification of Oljato has been considerably more difficult to ascertain, but like
Phaethon and 107P, its spectral properties at least appear to be more consistent with asteroids
than with the nuclei of classical comets ([107]and references within).

(v) Activity generation mechanisms in active asteroids

While this section on active asteroids has focused on sublimation, impact disruption and
rotational destabilization, there are other mechanisms that could potentially produce comet-
like mass loss on asteroids, including thermal fracturing (see Phaethon, above, or the case of
322P/SOHO 1 [108]), radiation pressure sweeping and electrostatic levitation [43]. Furthermore,
it is important to consider that activity for a given active asteroid could in fact be produced by
a combination of effects, and individual active episodes on the same active asteroid could even
have different sets of driving mechanisms each time. For example, 133Pâ€™s activity has been observed on multiple separate occasions and is therefore
strongly believed to be sublimation-driven. However, 133P is also known to have a short rotation
period (Prot =3.471h) and may have experienced an impact in the past that exposed buried ice,
triggering its current sublimation-driven activity [62].
