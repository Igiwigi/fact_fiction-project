Further, given the robust linear

from PIV analysis, to this point and computed the cellular tra- which may be called the strength of dynamic heterogeneity
jectories by integrating the instantaneous velocity field [9] (SDH), we mapped a SDH value from the cell density for all

Figure 2. Linking cell density and dynamic heterogeneity. (a) Overlapped brightfield and segmented cell boundaries, showing the centroid of each cell. Colours were
assigned according to the shape index. (b) (i) PlV-derived cellular trajectories, mapped onto the initial brightfield image. (ii) Compilation of all cell trajectories with
starting position of every cell set to zero. (c) (i) Evolution of mean square displacement (MSD) with time at different cell densities. (ii) Variation of effect diffusion
coefficient, as calculated from the graph in (i), with increasing cell density. (d) (i) The shape of four-point susceptibility function with respect to time at different
cellular densities. (ii) Variation of the peak height of four-point susceptibility function, as calculated from the graph in (i), with increasing cell density.
