creatic islets are known to have a low antioxidant defence
capacity that thus may explain their particular vulnerability to
maternal diet effects on telomere length. By contrast, pups
exposed to the low protein diet during lactation display increase
telomere length compared to controls, especially in their kid-
neys, of note since kidney disease is thought to a common
cause of death in laboratory rodents. Recent studies have
demonstrated that it is not just exposure to suboptimal nutrition
during foetal life that can impact on telomere length. Exposure
to hypoxia during foetal life also led to accelerated telomere
shortening [120]. These detailed experimental studies illustrate
the complexity of the relationship between growth, long-term
health and telomere dynamics and emphasize the fact that
there may be tissue-specific responses.

(e) The context in which growth occurs

A further problem is that, in correlative studies where telomere
length and loss are compared in individuals observed to be
growing at different rates, the outcome may be confounded
by differences in the environmental conditions they are experi-
encing, including the social environment as well as nutrition
and stress exposure. Depending on the importance of these
factors in generating adverse environmental conditions, two
different predictions are possible hereâ€”(i) that faster growing
