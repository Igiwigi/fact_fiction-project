In this case, cooperation
can evolve as a consequence of ‘social viscosity’ [1], and not
as a consequence of empathy explicitly. Additionally, it has
been argued that morality is distinct from empathy. In fact,
empathy can conflict with morality and justice by introducing
partiality because these two abilities rely on different ultimate
and proximate mechanisms [2,3]. While empathy is a power-
ful motivator for caring and helping behaviours in many
species, we distinguish the experience of empathy from con-
sequent behaviours. This is an important issue because we
are neither claiming that empathy is the only source of proso-
ciality nor that empathy and prosocial behaviour should be
conflated.
