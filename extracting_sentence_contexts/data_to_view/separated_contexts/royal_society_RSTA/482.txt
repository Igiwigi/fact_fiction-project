Most commonly such growth has been from the melt (e.g.
[29-31]), but it has also been shown to be possible using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). MBE
is an ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) technique in which controlled growth of ultrathin films of high
perfection can be achieved, particularly valuable for the fabrication of modern semiconductor
devices (e.g. [32-34]) including not only two-dimensional films but also one-dimensional wires
and (nominally) zero-dimensional ‘dots’. The fact that such crystals may be free of dislocations
clearly implies that spiral growth at screw dislocations does not play a role, and in general the
growth is based on the generation of single-layer height two-dimensional nuclei followed by
lateral expansion of these layers by step-edge growth until each layer is completed. This layer-
by-layer or Frank—van der Merwe growth can be clearly identified by monitoring diffracted beam
intensities from the surface. Most commonly this is achieved using the technique of reflection
high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), a technique using grazing incidence and grazing
emergence of the electrons, thus allowing molecular beam sources to be placed directly in front
of the crystal.
