space, and on increasing the thickness this dark band remains almost the same in width,
while four new bands make their appearance in the blue portion, and the violet is
absorbed. This question, however, appears susceptible of an experimentum crucis.
Were we to take any artificial light, and examine it by a prisgm through a sufficient
length of air, we ought to see the fixed lines deyeloping themselves, if they be due to
the atmosphere, or entirely absent, if otherwise. This was tried by Dr. GLADSTONE.
The lighthouse at Beachy Head exhibits thirty oil-lamps on a triangular stage, each
turnished with a large parabolic silvered reflector. 'The light of ten of these lamps at
once is thus thrown into one beam, which as the apparatus revolves sweeps the horizon,
and is visible about as far as any artificial light in existence. On the nights of August

* After this communication had been sent to the Society, Dr. GLavsTroNE was made acquainted with the
fact that the same idea had occurred previously to Professor Forprs, and that he had determined by the
annular eclipse of May 15, 1836, that the light from the edge of the solar disk is identical in this respect
with ordinary sunlight,â€”Phil. Mag. vol. ix. p. 522.


THE LINES OF THE SOLAR SPECTRUM. 159

31 and September 1, 1859, it was seen from Shoreham and Worthing, at the distance of
twenty-five and twenty-8even miles respectively, and across the sea, like a star of the
8econd magnitude, but of an orange colour. On examining it by the prisxm and tele-
8cope, it was resolved into a thread of light of a pale yellow colour, shading off into red
at one end and into green at the other, while absorbent glasses showed that the spec-
trum did not extend either way beyond C and F. No lines were detected. The result
