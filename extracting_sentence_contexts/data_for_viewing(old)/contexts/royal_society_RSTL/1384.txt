tion of tempering any blade of considerable length in this
way, would be attended with some difficulty.

In the account now given of the different alloys, only one
triple compound is. noticed, namely, steel, iridium and os-
mium ; but this part of the subject certainly merits farther
investigation, offering a wide and interesting field of research.
Some attempts to form other combinations of this description
proved encouraging, but we were prevented, at the time, by
various other avocations, from bestowing on them that atten-
tion and labour they seemed s0 well to'deserve.*

It is a curious fact, that when pure iron is substituted for
steel, the alloys so formed are much less subject to oxidation,
g per cent. of iridium and osmium fused with some pure iron,
gave a button, which when forged and polished was exposed,
with many other pieces, of iron, steel, and. alloys, to a moist
atmosphere/: it was the last of all showing any rust. The'co-
lour of this compound was distinctly blue ; it had the property
of becoming harder when heated to redness and quenched in
a cold fluid, On observing this steel-like character, we sus-

* It is our intention to continue these experiments at every opportunity, but
they are laborious, and require much time and patience.
