When the excess has been got rid of by a temporary hyperpncea
the breathing again becomes quiet ; and if the transition to want of oxygen is gradual
the temporary marked hyperpneea is not noticed. Want of oxygen, without the aid
of carbon dioxide, does not excite the respiratory centre at all; for YANDELL HENDERSON
