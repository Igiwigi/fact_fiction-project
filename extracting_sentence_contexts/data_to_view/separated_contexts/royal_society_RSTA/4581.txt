In each case it
rises. from the bottom of a hollow, but in the present: series it is a far finer jet and
moving with much greater velocity. This jet was, in fact, observed withÂ® the naked
eye, in continuous daylight, to rise even to a greater height than that from which
the sphere had fallen. Comparing the crater of this. series with that of Series I., we observe that while
the outside dimensions are not very different, the crater of the present series is
distinctly thinner in the wall, also that the number of lobes or arms is larger.
