Water used in chemical processes was also identified as an area for study because
the removal of contaminants is crucial to enable reuse of this resource that is becoming scarce in
many areas. Additionally, the design of catalysts was considered and, reinforcing the comments
of Michel Che, the use of ubiquitous elements was considered a key area for investigation, as is
the design of improved support materials. Ekkehard Schwab (BASF, Germany) continued by emphasizing the need for factual
information on what to base research directions on the topic of sustainability. He reminded us
that the three pillars that encompass society need to be balanced: these being the Planet—the
environmental pillar; the People—the social pillar; and the Prosperity—the economic pillar. The
question is what is the right balance for these three pillars?
