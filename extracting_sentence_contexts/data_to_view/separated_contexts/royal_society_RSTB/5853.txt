The same thing was seen in a low section of No. 29 (not shown
in fig. 18), though here the difference in level was very slight. The sections of No. 31
were too oblique to show the sequence of these leaves. The explanation of the fact that I,a and I,k arose sooner after I, in sub-group 2 than
in sub-group 1 may quite probably be that in sub-group 2 the operations were made
earlier in the plastochron. For if so, then it is to be expected, for reasons similar to
those given previously (1931, p. 18), that the effect of the shift of the growing-point
was greater in sub-group 2, and consequently that there was a greater increase in available
