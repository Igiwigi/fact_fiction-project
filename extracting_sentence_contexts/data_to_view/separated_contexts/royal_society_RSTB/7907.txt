This is due to the
idiosyncrasies, psychological and physical, of the observer. These errors are often taken
as constant and included in the systematic error. However, the work of Karl Pearson (1902)
and others has shown that these personal errors are not, in fact, constant, but show
a secular trend with a rather slow, irregular rhythm. As ‘Student’ (1gr7) says: ‘After
considerable experience, I have not encountered any determination which is not influenced
by the date on which it is made; from this it follows that a number of determinations of
the same thing made on the same day are likely to lie more closely together than if the
repetitions had been made on different days.’

In biological work, these slowly fluctuating errors, called by ‘Student’ the secular error
of the observations, are of great importance. This is because in biometrical studies it is
usually impossible to define exactly what is actually being measured.
