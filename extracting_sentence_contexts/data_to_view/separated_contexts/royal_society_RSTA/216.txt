Their
absolute intensities, with w, are to be regarded as unknowns, determinable from (12)
combined with specified boundary conditions of restraint; and these (normally) are
such that a solution can be multiplied by an arbitrary factor (P,, P,, S being held
constant) without violation of any governing condition. But transverse deflexion w
will, as in §2, entail extension and shear of the middle surface, consequently stresses
which will modify the initial stress system P., P,, S,, so as to make (on the whole) for
tension and thereby for stability. A more complete treatment may thus be expected
to indicate that w cannot in fact be so multiplied: higher initial stresses will be required
to maintain deflexions of greater magnitude, and the form of w will therefore alter as
its amplitude is increased. the influence of w upon these stress components: on that understanding P,

6. The extensional stresses which result from large deflexions (w) can be deduced
in the manner of §§ 2-3.
