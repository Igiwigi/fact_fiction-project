which propels it into the intestine, and the more perfectly it is digested, it
excites this action the more readily, the last part of the digested food which
has but imperfectly undergone the digestive process is expelled very slowly, 80
that it is very long before food wholly undigested alone is left.

That the longer the animal lives after the excision of part of the eighth pair
of nerves, the less digested food is left in the stomach, is a fact now admitted
by all who assisted at the experiments. Among the great number who have
witnessed and been satisfied with their result, are Sir Humpary Davy, Mr.
Tromas Anprew KNiGnr, and Mr. Bropis, gentlemen whose experimental
accuracy, in the opinion of the public, has never been surpassed.

Of this fact, the gentlemen to whose paper I have referred, are not aware.
They maintain, indeed, that the only effect on the digestive process produced
by the excision of part of the eighth pair of nerves, is, that it hecomes more
tedious, being as perfect as when the nerves are entire, if a sufficient length of
time be afforded. In speaking of the animals in which part of the eighth pair
of nerves has been cut out, and comparing them with the healthy animal, they
say : * Enfin, si on laisse Gcouler un espace de temps plus grand encore entre
roperation et la mort des animaux, on pourra trouver que la digestion est com-
pletement acheyce dans Yun comme dans Vautre cas.‚Äù

It will easily be perceived to what errors, respecting the effect on digestion,
of depriving the stomach of the office of the eighth pair of nerves, this miscon-
ception must lead. Its effect was increased in the experiments referred to,
