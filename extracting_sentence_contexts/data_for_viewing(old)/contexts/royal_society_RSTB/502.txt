B the smallest and 5°4 » for the largest sympathetic fibres. In other nerves, fibres of
2 “@ greater diameter than 5°4 w are included in the class of sympathetic fibres; thus

3 These views received very little support until GASKELL’s work in 1886. GASKELL
S concerned himself with efferent visceral fibres only ; he compared the function and the
£ histological characters of a considerable number of nerves, and pointed out that in all
% these cases the nerves which had visceral functions contained many small nerve-fibres,
so that there was good ground for believing that efferent visceral nerves are always
5 small. GAsKELL gives 1°8 to 3°6 « as the diameter of these nerve-fibres.
= . The theory of Broper and Vorkmany, that the large fibres of the sympathetic
3 system are fibres of general sensibility, seemed to me, at first sight, as satisfactory as
q it was simple, and I was the more inclined to adopt it because of some facts connected
& with the cervical sympathetic. Bupcr and Water found that stimulation of the
a cervical sympathetic in an unaneesthetised Rabbit caused no sign of pain. I have on
several occasions made special experiments on the anzsthetised Rabbit and Cat, with
the object of determining whether stimulation of the central end of the cervical sympa-
thetic causes a reflex of any kind, I have not observed any certain reflex, neither body
movement, nor variation of blood-pressure, nor change in rate of respiration or heart-
beat, nor alteration in the pupil or arteries of the opposite side of the head. On
microscopical examination the cervical sympathetic is sometimes found to be destitute
of any medullated fibre larger than 4 ». Most of the medullated fibres are 2°2 to
