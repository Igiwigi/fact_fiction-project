lobe, on the one hand, and the mesodermal cells underlying the medullary plate, and
extending outwards in relation to the entoderm as far as the parietal ccelom, on
the other hand, is tolerably clearly visible. This is especially the case in the neigh-
bourhood of the medullary margin, and again far outwards, where the lateral portion
of the ganglionic plate comes into relation with, and overlaps, the medial part of the
ceelomic cleft, or “ parietal cavity.”
a. We have seen in fig. 76 how, in Specimen H, the elevated medullary rim lies
% horizontally ; and it retains this attitude throughout its entire extent. In
2 Specimen M, on the other hand, it assumes an oblique or even nearly vertical
2 position, becoming at the same time concave medially. This condition is illustrated
A in Hit and Marrin’s figs. 2 and 3, Plate 10. In their fig. 3 the optic groove
S is very evident. In their fig. 2, however, the concavity there shown is incorrectly
© lettered “op. gr.” In point of fact, this section passes wholly in front of the
© anterior horn of the longitudinally (or paraxially) crescentic optic groove. This
o anterior extremity of the optic groove really fades away insensibly into the general
5 concavity of the up-standing medullary fold of the fore-brain region. It is this
‘9 latter concavity which is wrongly designated as the optje groove in fig. 2 of Hit
5 and Marrw’s paper.
‘5 In front of the connection of the base of the Trigeminus ganglionic lobe with the
4 medullary plate in the region of the fifth prefacial neuromere, no further ganglionic
> outgrowth or connection is met with. The sole representative of the neural crest,
S in front of the plane indicated, is the forward extension of the Trigeminus lobe itself,
£ which, as we have seen, lies alongside the anterior segment of the cephalic plate,
g_ but is wholly unconnected with it.
