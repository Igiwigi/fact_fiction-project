the work of inspecting children in schools, and why it should be “beyond their
power” to reinspect a few large schools year by year is by no means obvious. They
are at present (in the last Reports,t for 1898-99) issuing statistics of the frequencies
of different groups of defects for different ages. As I have already pointed out
(note on p. 304) these statistics are rendered almost worthless by the omission of the
frequency («By8)—the number of undefective children—at each age, only those who
were defective having apparently been noted. Even if the material were, however,
complete, it would not enable us to distinguish between changes due to selection and
changes due to growth, nor consequently to state what are the effects of these agencies
each by itself. Nothing but observance of one group of individuals year by year
can do this, and there seems little more difficulty in this than in the work already
being carried out. It is surely futile to expect a Royal Commission on the subject.
It would, in fact, be more appropriate for a body, specially created for the “Scientific
Study” of childhood, to take up an investigation of the greatest scientific interest
but probably of little immediate practical use. I would most strongly urge the

* There appear to be a good many misprints in the Report, many of the frequencies being in disagree-
ment with those given for the ultimate (“ Primary ”) groups. I have generally assumed the “ primary id

frequencies to be correct.
