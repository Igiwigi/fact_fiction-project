—sinus, atria, ventricle (superficial layers only), bulbus—are in general darkened on
the side nearest the heart cavity, and remain pale in their outermost parts. ‘This
darkening, due to reduction of the silver salt, shows a granular character, and has
not a sharply defined border but shades gradually towards the lighter part. ‘The
different regions of the nuclei of the majority of the fibres of the S-A ring also reduce
the silver salt unequally, but here it is the part of the nucleus towards the epicardium
which is dark, while that towards the endocardium remains pale. ‘The nuclei of the
fibres in the remaining parts of the heart show a more or less uniform reduction of
the salt throughout their substance, but, while those of the atrial septum and of
the deep ventricular trabeculae show granular deposit, those of the A-V ring, A-V
funnel and ventricular invagination are so uniformly black that the granular nature
can only be discerned with difficulty. That this uneven reduction of the silver salt by
the nuclei is not purely fortuitous, is rendered likely by the fact that three hearts,
separately treated at different times by the Bodian technique, all revealed the same
phenomenon. For this reason we record the observation. It is interesting to note that,
if sections previously treated by the Bodian method be decolorized (by treating with
iodine, potassium iodide and potassium cyanide) and subsequently stained with
haemalum, the nuclei show the even distribution of the blue-stained chromatin
material, similar in appearance to that observed in sections stained directly with
haemalum. ‘This would seem to indicate that the nuclear material responsible for
reducing the silver salt is not identical with that stained by the haemalum.

(4) Glycogen content of the cardiac muscle fibres (of the frog)
The present authors had intended to investigate the glycogen content of the muscle
fibres in the several parts of the salamander heart, when present hostilities prevented
