cannot doubt that in crystallization the smallest masses assume
the-same form with the largest: but then other hypotheses
may perhaps also account for the fact, such as atmospheres,
electric fluid, &c. &c.; $0 that till farther observations are made
we ought to rest contented with barely suggesting the query.
In the mean time, reserving to a future opportunity 'some in-
quiries concerning the chemical properties of light, and the
nature' of the forces which bodies exert on it internally, I con-
clude at present with a short summary of propositions. But
first, may TI be permitted to express a hope, that what-has been
already attempted (and for which no praise can be claimed far-
ther than what is due to attentive observation, according to the
rules of the immortal Bacon), may prove acceptable to such
as love to admire the beautiful regularity of nature, or more
particularly to trace her operations, asExhibited One of the
