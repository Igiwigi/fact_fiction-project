On the other hand, when the upward and downward flowing sheets met at the points
half-way between the out-flowing films they formed inward-flowing films of the same
type as the outward-flowing ones. The resulting appearance after the motion had
been going on for about two or three seconds was that of a series of thin equi-distant
planes of coloured fluid spaced at a distance equal to the thickness of the space between
the cylinders. In fact, after the first few seconds the motion appeared to get to a steady
state in which it was impossible to distinguish the outward-flowing films from the
inward-flowing ones, though all of them were extremely sharply defined. Photographs of the Stream Lines. Considerable difficulty was experienced in obtaining satisfactory photographs of the
phenomenon because when eosin was used instead of fluorescene a more concentrated
solution was necessary ; and it was found difficult to make up this solution so that its .
density remained the same as that of water when it was surrounded by water.
