‘Zdescribed. From these results it is deduced that the principal resistance changes to
= be expected when the grid is cooled by an oscillatory air-currents are :—

2p (1) A steady drop due to an average cooling ;
‘G (2) A periodic resistance change at the same frequency as that of the sound ; and
7S (3) A periodic resistance change of frequency twice that of the sound.

‘3 All these effects are found in practice.
8 Further deductions are that the steady change of resistance is proportional to the
‘Bintensity of the sound, while the periodic resistance change in (2) is proportional to the
amplitude. These conclusions are confirmed by experiment.
& A description is given of the effect to be observed when the microphone is tilted at
= various angles, and the observed facts are compared with what would be expected from
Sthe results of experiments with steady air-currents.
gy Finally, an account is given of some experiments which exemplify the use of the
3 Hot-Wire Microphone for observing the intensity and distribution of sound.

The work deseribed in this paper forms part of gn investigation commenced in the
A Munitions Inventions Department, and continued later at the Signals Experimental
Establishment, Woolwich.

In conclusion, the authors wish to express their indebtedness to the Chief Experimental
Officer of this Establishment for the interest which he has taken in the progress of the
work, and for the facilities which they have received for carrying out experiments.
