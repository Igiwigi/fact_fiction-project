Asian populations, depigmentation was not achieved through
mutations at the SLC24A5 locus [75], but via a different set of
genetic changes, which are still incompletely known [76,77].
The fact that depigmented skin evolved independently in the
ancestors of modern Europeans and East Asians suggests that
at least two (and probably more) distinct genetic mutation
events occurred and that multiple loci underwent positive selec-
tion in these two regions receiving relatively low levels of UVB
[78-80]. The most likely reason for this was that it was associated
with a loss of skin pigment that favoured vitamin D production
under conditions of low UVB [69,78,81]. Depigmented skin also
evolved independently in Homo neanderthalensis [82] probably
for the same reason. The ‘palette’ of skin and hair colour genes
is extensive and, especially outside of Africa, there is evidence
that multiple genes of small effect have contributed to subtle
differences in integumentary coloration [83].
