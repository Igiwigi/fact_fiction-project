«The firing took place at 1.40 p.x., The guns proved were of comparatively small
8ize—64-pounders, with 10-lb. charges of powder.

.* The concussion experienced at my house and office, about three quarters of a mile
from the butt, was decidedly more severe than that experienced when the heaviest guns
are proved with charges of 110 to 120 1bs. of powder. There was a dense fog here at
the time of firing.”

These were the guns heard by the inspector ; but on subsequent inquiry it was ascer-
tained that two guns were fired at about 3 p.x. These were the guns heard by myself.

Professor ABEL also communicated to me the following fact :—* Our workmen's bell
at the Arsenal Gates, which is of moderate size and any thing but clear in tone, is pretty
distinctly heard by Professor BLoxAM only when the wind is north-east. During the whole
of last week the bell was heard with great distinctness, the wind being 80uth-westerly.
The distance of the bell from BLoxax's house is about three quarters of a mile as the
crow flies.”

Slowly but/ surely we thus master this question ; and the further we adyance the
more we are assured that, our reputed knowledge regarding it has been erroneous from
beginning to end. Fogs have no sch power to deaden sound as, since the time of
Dena, has been universally ascribed to them.
