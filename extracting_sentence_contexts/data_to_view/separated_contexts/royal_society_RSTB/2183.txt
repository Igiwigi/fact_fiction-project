anemia of the cortex. ‘This vaso-motor theory of the loss of consciousness was the
natural outcome of KussMavts localisation of a convulsive centre in the spinal bulb. This theory has, in my opinion, no basis in fact, for excitation of the vaso-motor
centre, by increasing the arterial pressure, accelerates the flow of blood through the
brain.*

ALBERTONI, moreover, has shown that complete fits are produced equally well
after as before division of the cervical sympathetic nerves. +

The localisation of a convulsive centre in the bulb has been overthrown by the
discovery of cortical epilepsy (Hirzic and Hucuiincs Jackson). Moreover, con-
vulsive movements may be discharged from the spinal cord after a sub-bulbar
section of the same has been made. These convulsions may be excited by asphyxia
(LucustnGer) and by anemia (Scutrr, 8.
