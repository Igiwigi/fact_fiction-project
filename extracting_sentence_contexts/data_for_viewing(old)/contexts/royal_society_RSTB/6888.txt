la prophase hétérotypique, les filaments continuent a s’étirer et deviennent trés longs
et minces. Cette formation de filaments longs et minces (noyaux leptoténes) constitue
la vraie caractéristique du début de la prophase hétérotypique.” In the light of the
facts presented above it would appear probable that this expression of opinion as to
the essential difference between the early prophases of meiosis and mitosis is as
authoritative as anything which has been written on this subject in the last thirty
years.* Before attempting to interpret it further it is, however, necessary to examine
another type of physical evidence, namely, the manifestations of chromosome elasticity.

CHROMOSOME ELASTICITY AS EVIDENCE OF SUBMICROSCOPIG CONVOLUTIONS

Chromosome elasticity can be observed in two ways, firstly, by actual pulling on the
chromosomes by mechanical interference with the cell, and secondly, by observation
of chromosome behaviour as they pull on each other. Some evidence from both these
sources is available in Osmunda.
