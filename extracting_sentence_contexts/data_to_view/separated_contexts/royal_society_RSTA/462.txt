The value for tin tetraethyl is 12-5 kcal. calculated from the
points of Griittner & Krause (1917), Garner & Sugden (1929) and Jones et al. (1935). In the case of aluminium trimethyl, allowance has to be made for the fact that the vapour
is associated. Laubengayer & Gilliam (1941) give 9-6 kcal./mol. for the heat of vaporization
over the range 23 to 70Â° C, where the vapour is apparently dimeric, and 20-2 kcal.
