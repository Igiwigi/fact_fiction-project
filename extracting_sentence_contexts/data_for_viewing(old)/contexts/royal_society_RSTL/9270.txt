the ganglionic end of the strip courses all the way along the latter in the opposite
direction to that which the tentacular wave had previously pursued.

In connexion with these tentacular waves I may further state that it does not signify
how much of the tentacular rim is removed from the organism ; for, however small a
number of tentacles are left adhering to the margin, they exhibit the same action as when
the whole series is intact.

(4) Now the occurrence of these tentacular waves is invaluable for the purpose of
the experiments next to be described. These experiments consist in submitting the
swimming-bell of Aurelia to various forms of section, with the view of ascertaining
the extent to which the nervo-muscular tissnes may be thus mutilated without suffering
loss of their excitational continuity. The importance of any facts established by these
experiments will doubtless be appreciated, in view of the theoretical standing of the
analogous facts which we have 8 recently been considering with regard to con-
tractional continuity, Of course the value of tentacular waves in these experiments
consists in the circumstance that they never occur except in response to stimulation,

and that when they do occur they are of 80 unmistakable a character as to leave
not the smallest room for 8upposing them due to any cause other than the passage of a
