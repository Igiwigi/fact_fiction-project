bearing planes. The latter distance must be corrected by the amount + 2a, where a is
the compression occurring at the knife-edge.

The computation of this correction 2a is given in Appendix II; its value, if both
the bearing surface and the knife-edge had been of steel, is shown to be less than 0-54
for any radius of knife-edge between 2-5 and 25y. This corresponds with a correction
to the measured value of g amounting to not more than 5 parts in 10 millions, but since,
in the actual pendulum used, no definite information was available regarding the
elastic constants of the chromium plated planes supported by the steel knife-edge, the
calculated values are not very reliable. The calculated correction, however, is small,
and since the modulus of rigidity of the chromium plating is almost certainly greater
than that of steel, the true value of the correction is probably still smaller, and might
in fact have been neglected in computing the final value of g.

The actual radii of the knife-edges were measured by an adaptation of the method
described by Schmerwitz (1932). The knife-edge was mounted horizontally on a bracket
attached to a horizontal spindle which could be smoothly rotated in a bearing and
the angle of rotation could be measured by means of a micrometer attached to the
end of a 10 in. arm fixed radially to the spindle. An accurately made steel beam, of
width equal to the width of the pendulum in contact with the knife-edge, and of
section as shown in fig. 6 was carefully balanced on the knife-edge. The under surface
of this beam, where it came into contact with the knife-edge, was ground and lapped
accurately flat and the upper surface was lapped flat so as to act as a plane mirror.
Then, if the knife-edge is rotated through an angle @, the beam tilts through the angle ¢,
where 7 = x tan ¢/(9—¢). r is the radius of curvature of the knife-edge, and x is the
