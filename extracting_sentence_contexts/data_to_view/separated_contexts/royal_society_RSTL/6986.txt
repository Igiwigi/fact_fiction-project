Operating with the two sides of the same equation on a function H of the order
m', we find
m(m—1)UFH—(m—1)%H= mw(m'—1)ÞH
—2(m—1)IVH
+ LTH
and in particular if H is the Hessian, then writing m'=39—6, and putting U=0, we
find the before-mentioned expression for DH.
61. But we may also from the general identical equation deduce the expression for
(0H). In fact taking H a function of the degree m' and writing
