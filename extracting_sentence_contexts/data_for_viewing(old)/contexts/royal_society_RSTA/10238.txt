northerly deflection, two show a southerly deflection, and three show the direction of
gravity to be vertical. The mean deflection throughout the trigon is 6-4 North.

Now if we are to accept these results as final, we shall have to believe that
throughout the third region the level surface is always inclined by 6-4 to the
spheroidal surface. We know of no cause tending to produce such an extraordinary
deformation, and we are led to suspect the reasoning by which its existence has been
inferred. The only certain fact that has been brought to light by observation is that
the plumb-lines in the trigon have a northerly deflection greater by 6’°4 than the
plumb-line at Kalitnpur. We have, however, taken a step in advance of this safe
ground, and have assumed that the direction of gravity at Kaliénpur is vertical, and
that consequently the plumb-line throughout peninsular India is deflected 6”*4 towards
the north. Would it not be more reasonable to assume that the mean direction of
gravity throughout the third region is vertical. and that the plumb-line at Kaliénpur
is deflected 6’°4 towards the south? The assumption of a southerly deflection of
6”"4 at Kalisnpur will lead then to the conclusion that throughout the third region
the level surface remains generally parallel to the spheroidal surface.

From visible evidence Kaliénpur, situated as it is in flat plains, would be adjudged
a suitable datum station, but it unfortunately lies in the zone of southerly deflection,
