It appears that, with such wave-lengths as are used in practice, a moderate
amount of resistance, such as that of sea-water, increases the strength of the signals at
great distances. A slightly higher resistance would increase it still more, but no
conclusion can safely be drawn as to the effect of so high a resistance as that of dry
ground. It seems to me, however, to be not unlikely that even a rather high
resistance may be favourable, and I am inclined to regard the known fact that
signals are in general appreciable at greater distances over sea than over land, as an
effect of the broken surface of ground covered with rocks, buildings, or trees. This
question also remains to be settled by quantitative experimental investigation. Another difficult question presents itself in the known fact that the signals are
generally stronger by night than by day, and the related fact that the attenuation of
night signals by distance is sometimes less than it would be if they diminished simply
