At 27° C and 90 % r.u. the combined larval
and pupal life of X. brasiliensis was significantly longer than that of both the sexes of
X. cheopis and that of the female of X. astia. The combined larval and pupal life of the
male of X. astia, however, did not differ statistically from that of X. brasiliensis; though it
was significantly longer than that of X. cheopis. The fact that at 29° C and 90% r.u. the
combined larval and pupal life of X. brasiliensis was statistically longer than that of the other
two species, indicates that the developmental rate in this species was intrinsically the
slowest, as this temperature is optimum for X. brasiliensis; no such difference, however,
existed between the other two species. At 32° C 80% Rr.u. satisfied practically all the conditions of an optimum humidity for
the three species (tables 23, 24). A significant retardation in the development of the
larvae of X. cheopis at 90% R.H. when compared with that at 80% r.u. was due to slight
crust formation.
