scores and monitor their olfactory performance in the
coming years. In this context it is interesting to note that in
a longitudinal study [62], an improvement in olfactory func-
tion was accompanied by an improvement in semantic—
categorical verbal fluency, highlighting the association
between the functioning of the sense of smell and cognitive
abilities.

A limitation of the current study refers to a significant age
difference between subjects with normosmia and subjects
with impaired olfaction. Although we controlled for subjects’
age during the analyses, one cannot rule out possible arte-
facts. There is the possibility that the significant difference
in physical functioning of the two groups might be attributed
more to the age difference than to the olfactory abilities, but

to determine this a replication with more age-balanced
groups would be appropriate. We have tested this in a
reduced sample where age was perfectly balanced between
the groups and this difference was not significant, further
suggesting the effect of age rather than olfactory performance
on physical functioning.

of compounds that constitute body odours, may have more
