the world of chemistry on which the attention may adyantageously be concentrated. Ordinary language is too vague and too diffuse for the purposes of science, and in
chemistry especially the facts are 80 numerous and s0 complicated that it is only when
embodied in a concrete form that they can be stored in the memory, and become the
object of reflection. Hence even an imperfect and material picture may, in a certain
epoch of the development of the science, be found of indispensable utility. The actual theory of chemistry may be regarded as an expansion of the hypothesis of
DaLron.
