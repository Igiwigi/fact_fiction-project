In this brief summary, we shall focus mainly on the essential
ideas and on the physical motivation of the mathematical approach, with full details and rigorous
analysis provided in a longer paper [18]. The conclusion of the analysis is that certain specific
types of discontinuity of the velocity at the wall are required for a strict momentum anomaly, in
agreement with the early insight of Taylor [15] and with similar conclusions for kinetic energy
anomaly [1-4]. In fact, we shall see that even a ‘weak anomaly’ in momentum conservation
requires a less than smooth approach of the streamwise velocity to zero as the distance to the
wall is decreased through the inertial sublayer, in analogy also to energy dissipation [19,20]. We
obtain in this manner a version of Prandtl’s relation between the Blasius drag law f(Re) ~ Re~!/4
and a (1/7)th power-law approach of the streamwise velocity to zero ([21,22], and see also [23], pp.
599-600), but now rigorously valid for individual flow realizations without ensemble averaging. At asymptotically large Reynolds numbers, we can similarly show that the von Karman—Prandtl
drag law requires a logarithmically slow approach of the streamwise velocity to zero at the
wall [18].
