be driven out, or, at least, some particular species may be 80 greatly favoured that the
others are banished, either by the superior vigour exhibited by the victorious species,
or by the directly injurious agency of the manure applied. From this point of view
the comparative details hereafter given as to yarious members of the same genus which
Q exhibit opposite tendencies, especially Poa pratensis and Poa trivialis, and the different
= gpecies of Arena, which nevertheless manifest very opposite tendencies, may profitably
Z be studied,
SZ This opposite tendency between nearly allied plants (further illustrated by the
S occasional impossibility of grafting, or of mutually fertilising, allied species), is a most,
SD interesling phenomenon, and of great importance from both a scientific and a practical
S point of view. Several illustrations of it will appear further on ; meanwhile we may,
b= in passing, allude to the necessity for caution in the interpretation of isolated experi-
=] ments which this fact demonstrates. Because 9 particular grass, or other plant, is
2 little benefited by ammonia-salts, for instance, it does not follow that it will not be
S favoured by nitrates ; nor, because if while growing in association with other Species it
= may not be specially benefited by a particular manure, does it follow that it would not
2 derive advantage from the same substance when growing separately,
£ The alleged antagonism of certain plants has been supposed to be dne to the
X injurious effects of root-excretions ;* but this supposition is, to 8ay the least, not
S a sufficient explanation of the observed phenomena. The true explanation of the facts
E recorded lies probably in the varying conformation and requirements of different
= plants, as will be illustrated in snbsequent sections. The adyantages derived from
© the practice of rotation also receive illustration from these same cireumstances,
