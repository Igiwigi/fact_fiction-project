The focal spot will have a power in the
450-650 nm band of 1 MW, and a diameter of 1.3 m, 0.026 of the 50m entrance aperture. In broad brush outline, the structure we consider shown in figure 4 resembles the Atreus
Treasury in being built as a cone of blocks under compression from soil above. In fact, the weight
of the 25m of regolith we envisage is no greater than that of the 4m thickness of soil over the
Treasury. The conical corbelled type of structure of the Treasury is favoured because it is adapted
to both regolith loading and to inclusion of the oculus opening at the top while still keeping all
the blocks in compression. We envisage that detailed finite-element modelling and local testing
(allowing for Earthâ€™s six times higher gravity) will be used to optimize and validate the design.
