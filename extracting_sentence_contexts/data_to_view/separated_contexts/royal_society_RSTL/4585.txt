I would place first the method. of observing liquid diffusion. This method,
although simple, appears to admit of sufficient exactness, It enables us to make a
new class of observations which can be expressed in numbers, and of which a vast
variety of substances may be the object, in fact everything soluble, Diffusion is also
a property of a fundamental character, upon which other properties depend, like the
volatility of substances ; while the number of substances which are soluble and there-
fore diffusible, appears to be much greater than the number of volatile bodies. 2. The novel scale of Solution Densities, which are suggested by the different dif-
fusibilities of salts, and to which alone, guided by the analogy of gaseous diffusion,
we can refer these diffasibilities.
