A natural question, both from an operator-theoretic perspective and from the point of view
of applications to PDEs, is whether semi-uniform stability can be quantified. To clarify the
quantification problem note first that convergence of || T()A71|| to zero can formally be translated
into an estimate of the form

IT@x|| =O), t—> 00, (3.5)

for some function r ¢ Co(R+) and for every x € D(A), that is, for every classical solution of the
Cauchy problem = Au. If the semigroup (T(f));>0 is stable but not exponentially stable, then
one can never expect such an estimate to hold for every initial value x € X. Indeed, having (3.5)
for every x € X is equivalent to exponential stability by a simple application of the uniform
boundedness principle, as has already been observed. In fact, for strongly stable semigroups
which are not exponentially stable we obtain the following statement; see [3,80].

Theorem 3.3.

(a) Let (T(t))t>0 be a strongly stable but not exponentially stable Co-semigroup on a Banach space X.
Then for every positive r € Co(R4) there exists x € X such that ||T(t)x\| = r(t) for all t = 0.

(b) Let (T(t))t>0 be a weakly stable but not exponentially stable Co-semigroup on a Hilbert space X.
Then for every positive r € Co(R4), there exists x € X such that |(T(t)x,x)| = r(t) for all t > 0.

Note that for non-exponentially stable semigroups the above statements also rule out the
possibility of various integral conditions being satisfied for all semigroup orbits. This is in
