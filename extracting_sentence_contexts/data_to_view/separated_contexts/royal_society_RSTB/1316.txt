Do these represent stages at
the beginning of the process ? If there are twenty-one cases in which binary fission has begun and the segments
into which the nucleus has divided are still large and few in number, the cases in
which, by this process, many nuclei of smaller size have been produced, ought to be
abundant. The fact is, that amongst the 1760 examples of the megalospheric form
which have been examined (up to January 12, 1894), including a large number in
some stage of the reproductive phase, not one has presented itself which showed an
intermediate condition between that with seven comparatively large nuclei and
with multitudes of minute nuclei of minimal size. Although the conclusion is founded on negative evidence, it seems clear that
view that the small nuclei of the later stage are derived from the large nucleus
binary fission is untenable. *
