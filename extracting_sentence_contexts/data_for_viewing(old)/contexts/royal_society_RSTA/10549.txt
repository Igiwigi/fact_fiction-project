The two factors of A; (viz, 3B’ and Q;) are given in approximate forms in
“ Harmonies,” and therefore, if we made allowance for the different definition of Q/
adopted in that paper, we might calculate Q’. The computations I made showed
that the results obtained in that way would have been sufficiently exact, but as it
was clear that the approximation to the Q functions was not very close, and as the
computation is tedious, it seemed better to find the G,’ by quadratures.

In order to do this I divided y or 69° 49’ by 12, and took 5° 49/545 as the common
difference, say 6, I then computed sec x, a + b cot? x + ¢ cot'y +..., and
see x + (a + b cot? x + ¢ cot'y...)* for values of p= 0, 8, 28,+.. 128 or y.

As a fact the first five or six values need not be computed because the early values
of the functions to be integrated are practically zero. The ordinary formule of

quadratures are inappropriate for these integrations, because the function, say U,, to
be integrated increases so very rapidly. I therefore take an empirical and integrable
function, say v,, which is such that 0,5 = wo, Yj, = %,; the quadratures may then be
applied to w%,—v,, and the result applied as a correction to [vd In fact this
correction is always very small, and we might well be satisfied to use |v dy, which is
