causal would imply at least a partial conception of this reality. However, even if one adopts the
weak RWR view, which only precludes a representation, rather than conception, of this reality,

causality is difficult to maintain in quantum physics. To do so requires a sufficient degree of :F
representation, analogous to that found in classical physics, which appears to be prevented, in : a
particular, by the uncertainty relations. As Schrédinger noted: ‘if a classical state does not exist at : =

‘The classical frame of concepts’ may appear to refer to the concepts of classical physics, and
in part it does. However, by this time (in 1949), Bohr adopts a view that comes close to the
