The DSFD approach shines most intensely whenever continuum PDE models
simply do not exist, or are just very hard to solve on a computer, typical
examples in point being multi-phase/multi-component flows, with highly space
time-dependent interfaces, and flows in realistically complex geometries.

The advantages of the DSFD approach have been widely emphasized in the
literature, and need not be revisited here.

Rather, as approaches to the discrete simulation of fluid are now entering their
vigorous maturity, we believe that a new synthesis best describes their place
in computational fluid dynamics. Despite their many merits, discrete simulation
methods are obviously not a panacea. In fact, many notions and concepts from
PDE discretization have proven extremely valuable in boosting their quality

and overall performance, a statement that is particularly true for the widely
popular Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, de facto a powerful blend of particle
and grid methods.
