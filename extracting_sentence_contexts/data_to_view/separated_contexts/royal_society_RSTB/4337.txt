Some Other Instances of Pre-determination. We noticed in the Spacing Experiment that the effect of the rising water-table on
wide-sown plants was quite as marked as on field-sown plants, but with the difference
that in the former case the effect was delayed for a month. This was due to the
fact that the differentiation of buds was checked, but all those buds already dif-
ferentiated were able to open after due lapse of time, as in the case of the defoliated
plant (p. 174). In the 1909 Terraces the check due to the trodden “pan” at a depth of 50 cm. is
shown by the flowering-curve on July 1 (fig. 3), although our available evidence
regarding the development of the root-system would indicate that such a depth
must have been reached by the root much sooner than this date, This apparent
discrepancy becomes strong evidence in favour of our interpretation concerning the
“pan” effect, when the additional four weeks is allowed for the check to become
manifest,

The rise of the flowering-curve in 1910 (fig. 4), after water-shortage had been
removed by irrigation on July 5, is a mixed effect, in part pre-determined, and in
part immediate. The direct effect is to check bud-shedding, and to restore the
normal condition of diurnal water-strain, so that by July 17 the curves begin to
show their normal simultaneous fluctuations, which had been pre-determined in mid-
June before the plots had become water-short.
