With the equations in this form we easily pursue the investigation of the dispersion
formula ; and this condition is, in fact, assumed by M. Caveny, by Mr. KeLLanp
and others, though without explicit reference to the axes of elasticity. In the case of elliptically polarized light we are obliged to adopt a peculiar method. We have here to consider not, as in the common case, a rectilinear displacement e,
and its resolved parts Â£, x, 7, but a curvilinear displacement, which is the result of two
virtual rectilinear displacements acting at right angles to each other, and in a plane
to which the ray is perpendicular; and one of which is always retarded behind the
other by an interval b, which we consider as an arc less than 7.
