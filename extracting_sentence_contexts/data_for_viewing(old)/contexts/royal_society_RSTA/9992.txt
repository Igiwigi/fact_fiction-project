Diurnal Inequality. Fourier Coefficients.
§13. The diurnal inequality was analysed in the usual way in a series
¢, Sin (¢-+0) +¢ sin (2¢+ 4) +...,

where ¢ is time counted from midnight (G.M.T.), one hour being taken as equiva-
lent to 15°. Thus ¢, cs, ¢s, ¢,, denote the amplitudes, a, %, 4, and a, the phase
angles of the terms whose periods are respectively 24, 12, 8, and 6 hours. The
object of such an analysis is to provide a ready means of tracing affinities and
differences between different stations at the same season, and between different
seasons at the same station. The most instructive way of presenting the facts is
probably to show side by side the corresponding results for the different types of
years and for the different kinds of days.

Table VII. contrasts the amplitudes of the 24- and 12-hour terms from ordinary
and disturbed days for each month of the year. Similar complete results were
calculated for the 8- and 6-hour terms, but only those for ordinary days from the
11-year period are included. A complete set of seasonal values are, however, given
