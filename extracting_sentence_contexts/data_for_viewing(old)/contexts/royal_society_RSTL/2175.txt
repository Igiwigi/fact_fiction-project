they were free from magnetism. The needles were placed
in various directions in the plane of the magnetic meridian,
sometimes in the angle of the dip, sometimes perpendicular
to the magnetic meridian, and also at various angles with
regard to it. In some cases the heads of the needles were
exposed in place of the points, to the violet rays. Â© Perhaps it
might have been expected that the influence would have
been greater in those instances in which the needles were
placed in the plane of the magnetic meridian, and at the
angle of the dip; and, consequently, polarity might have
been expected to take place in a shorter time under these
circumstances ; yet in fact there seemed to be no difference ;
most of the needles became magnetic, some in longer, others
in shorter periods, varying from about half an hour to four
hours, but depending on circumstances which I have not yet
been able to detect, further | than that a' number of results
induced me to believe, that the experiments were more suc-
cessful from ten to twelve, or one o'clock, than later in the
day. The portion of the needle exposed was almost always
a north pole, whether it pointed upwards or downwards. In
a few instances in which the contrary occurred, it may possi-
bly have arisen from some previous disposition in the needle
to magnetism, too slight to be observed.
