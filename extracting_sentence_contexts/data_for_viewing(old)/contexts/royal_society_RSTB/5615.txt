The commissures.—The anterior commissure receives fibres from all of the nuclei
of the amygdaloid complex except the lateral. These fibres enter the ventral part of
the commissure and pass medially.

The Telencephalon.

The telencephalon, unusually large for an animal of the size of Ornithorhynchus, may
be divided into the customary lobes with some degree of accuracy. The smooth surface
of the cortex is almost unbroken by fissures except that of the cruciate (/.c., fig. 46, a)
which the author has taken to be the homologue of the fissura centralis, because the
largest pyramidal cells in the cortical layers’are found near it and because the descending
pathways from the cortex originate in that vicinity. If these facts form a basis for judg-
ment then the cortex anterior to this fissure is frontal lobe, and posterior to it the
parietal lobe.

Upon its lateral surface there is a shallow indication only of the lateral fissure (f1.,
fig. 46, b) which serves nevertheless as a boundary between the more ventral part of the
parietal and the dorso-anterior limit of the temporal. However, because of the poor
fixation of the material, it is impossible macroscopically to establish exact boundaries for
