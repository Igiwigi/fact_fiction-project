placed in relation to each other. The wave-lengths of as many lines as possible were
determined in this way from several plates, and the mean values of these were
employed as standards in the measurements of several series of photographs taken of
the new spectrum alone. In this way the wave-lengths of the fainter lines were
obtained and also a certain amount of check was applied to the measurements of the
standards themselves. Excepting a few lines in the red region and the fainter lines,
nearly every line was measured in two orders, which ensures a correct relation
between the different regions of the spectrum.

Tt was stated above that the spectra of the new gases are composed of bright and
well defined lines; it will be seen, however, from the tables, that certain lines are
marked as being diffused, which may appear at first sight to be rather contradictory.
The explanation is to be found in the fact that the distinctness of the spectrum and
the definition of the lines depend to a great extent upon the pressure of the gas in
the vacuum tube. If this pressure exceeds a certain small amount, the whole
appearance of the spectrum is altered, for it tends to become confused, and at times

indeed almost continuous. If the pressure is slowly reduced, the lines begin to
appear upon a more or less continuous background, and, gradually increasing in
brightness, they finally become quite sharply detined upon a black background. This
effect is especially noticeable in the spectra of krypton and xenon, and in filling
vacuum tubes with these gases, great care must be taken to reduce the pressure
