Adopting the
general grouping of the lines already considered, we could avoid the phenomenon of
staggering by considering the whole as made up of two systems superposed, and having
very nearly, but not quite, the same origin (v,). Alternate members in the two branches
would then belong to the same P or R branch. If these were regarded as a whole quantum
and a half quantum system superposed (as shown in fig. 3), arising, of course, from the

known, extrapolate for 7 = 0 to vy and vy + C/4, respectively. This would correspond to
