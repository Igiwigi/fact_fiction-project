The extent of binding to CCT or GroEL was
determined by calculating the fraction bound to chaperonin compared to total protein synthesized (weak < 5%, medium = 5-15%, strong > 15%). Results
from independent studies are shown in column 5 and referenced in column 6. nd, not done; nt, not previously studied. CCT binding GroEL binding CCT binding
