This he regards as plates 2a and 2b united together. It may be doubted whether
so much complete fusion of plates would have occurred during development. This form
is primitive in spite of the fact that it possesses a sub-anal fasciole (Lovin, 1874,
Plate XIII, figs. 108, 110, 111). It may be that no fusion of the plates takes place,
but that plate 2b displaces plate 2a (i.e., separates it entirely from the peristomial plate)
in areas 1, 2 and 4, while plate 2a displaces plate 2b in area 3. In Ananchytes sulcata,
for example, plate 2b has separated plate 2a from the unpaired plate in area 4, and the
same is true for area 1 if no fusion of plates 2a and 2b (as indicated by Lovin, 1874,
Plate XXIV, fig. 181) has occurred.
