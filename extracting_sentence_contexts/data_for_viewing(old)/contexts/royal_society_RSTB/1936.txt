4. That the fibres of the lateral fillet coming from the auditory ganglion end in the
posterior quadrigeminal body of the same and the opposite side, and others pass on
to the internal geniculate body of the opposite side.

5. That of the fibres arising de novo in the posterior quadrigeminal body some
pass upwards to the sub-thalamic region, and others pass downwards into the lateral
column of the spinal cord.

6. That there is no evidence that fibres pass directly from the lateral fillet to the
cortex of the temporal lobe, without interruption in the internal geniculate body.

(Some further facts on the connexions of the optic thalamus and the cerebral
cortex are given in Section D.)

(f) Destruction of the Superior Temporal Gyrus.

When sections were made through the crura cerebri in the cases in which this
operation had been performed, degeneration was observed in those fibres which
occupied the outermost bundles of the pes. In frontal sections of the upper portion
of the quadrigeminal region, this degeneration chiefly occupied definite fasciculi in the
outer portion ; on passing lower down it was confined to approximately the outer
fifth or fourth. This degeneration was traced through the crus in this situation into
the upper portion of the pons, where it gradually disappeared from view ; but there
was no clear evidence as to the destination of this bundle, although the probability
