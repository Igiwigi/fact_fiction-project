\ no radical difference between the nature of the discharge in high and low vacua, and it
* does away with the idea (apparently suggested by the phenomena, of phosphorescence)
\ that in high vacua the discharge is only derived from the negative terminal. In
© addition to this, the establisghment of the fact that even in the absence of positive
© Juminosity the positive terminal may be the prime source of the electric discharge,
and the negative discharge may be only a response to the positive, sheds important
"I ight upon the functions of the molecular streams which accompany the negative
