An example of this is given
by drifting buoys trajectories obtained in [5]. When dropped at the same initial position, two
buoys followed opposite trajectories as described by Lagrangian residual trajectories. In fact,
with the same starting position, a different starting time can mean that buoys are launched in
water masses distant of up to 30 km. These different water masses could have completely different
behaviour in the Alderney Race zone. This particular feature concerns the long-term behaviour


of dispersed pollutants.
