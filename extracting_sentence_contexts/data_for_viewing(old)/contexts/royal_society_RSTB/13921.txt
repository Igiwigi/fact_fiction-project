be too high [60]. Alternatively, the energy savings of nonag- quo (limited assessment of power, comparing dissimilar
gressive means of power may be insufficient to lead to their phenomena lumped under the term dominance hierarchy)
widespread evolution. The fitness benefits of using nonag- is problematic.

gressive means may vary across taxa, perhaps explaining
why social styles have strong phylogenetic signals in the
genus Macaca [33,59].

‘Some hens will not let their despots chase them from the nest’

Schjelderup-Ebbe [1] noted that factors other than position in a
pecking order can determine who wins a conflict. Winning
hens, in fact, are only successful between 40% and 100% of
the time [48]. This variation in success rate is considered the
5. Rank is one measure of power amount of power [18]. Deviations from expectations derived
from a hierarchy can arise because the ability to win a conflict
may be context-dependent [33,42] or because leverage can add
to the cost of winning [16]. For example, initiators typically win
conflicts regardless of sex in bonobos and males initiate less
aggression towards females with large sexual swellings [64].
A single hierarchy is just one rank ordering of individuals in
a group based on one criterion and does not equal the complete
picture of power [18,29]. Indeed, power structures can have
stable and flexible layers [15,32]. One hypothesis is that intrin-
sic dominance may be more stable than leverage (cf. [15]).
