However, metallic or non-metallic status is not
an inherent and unchanging property for any chemical element. In relation to the periodic table,
atomic properties and elemental density are the key parameters governing an element's metallic
or non-metallic status. These data assembled in figure 13 represent a remarkable manifestation of that striking fact. Thus, within the giant planets, our periodic table would appear quite different (one possible
form is shown in figure 13) with no evidence of the usual (instantly recognizable) diagonal
dividing line within the p-block separating metals and non-metalsâ€”the very cornerstone of our
classification of the chemical elements on our own planet. The question we, therefore, should ask of a chemical element of the periodic table is not ...
