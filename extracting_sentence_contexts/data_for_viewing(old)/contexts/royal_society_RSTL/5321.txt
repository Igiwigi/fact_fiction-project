OF INDIGO IN HUMAN URINE. 309

singular that I should 80 frequently have met with indigo in urine, the occurrence of
which has hitherto been deemed s0 rare, and not have fallen in with a single case
of cyanourine or uroglaucin, the presence of which might be considered, from the
inquiries of Braconnor, SCHERER and HeLLts, to be s0 much more common.

Taking into consideration then the whole of the facts and observations recorded
in this communication, the following conclusions remain to be deduced :â€”

1st. That blue indigo is frequently formed in human urine ; the quantity being
subject to the greatest yariation. In some cases it is 80 considerable as to impart a
deep green or bluish-green colour to the whole urine, and to form a pellicle of nearly
pure indigo over the whole surface of the liquid. In others the blue scum is formed,
but the urine itself does not become either blue or green; and occasionally the
quantity is 80 small, that it can only be detected by means of the microscope.

2nd. That for the formation of this indigo, it is in general necessary that the urine
8bould be exposed to the air for some days in an open vessel, when oxygen is absorbed
and the blue indigo developed. Whatever facilitates therefore oxygenation, as free
