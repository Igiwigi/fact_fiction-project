8pheroid eapressed in terms of its rotation is large compared with the reciprocal of
its elipticity.

In his address, Sir WiLLTam 'THOMSON did not give a criterion for the case of a fluid
spheroid withoub any confining hell, but for the cage of a thin rigid spheroidal shell
enclosing fluid he gave a statement which involves the above criterion, save that the
ellipticity referred to is that of the sbell itself; for he says, © The amount of this
difference (in precession and nutation) bears the same proportion to the actual precession
or nutation as the fraction measuring the periodic speed of the disburbance (in terms
of the period of rotation as unity) bears to the fraction measuring the interior ellipticity
of the shell.”

This is, in fact, almost the game result as mine.

This subject is again referred to in Part III. of the succeeding paper.

Sir Witrta Tx0450x's criterion was added to the paper on September 17, 1879.
