whether there was any regularity in their arrangement, the tissue of the specimens of
B. Ceres being somewhat soft. No special opening corresponding to the gland-masses
could be detected along the line exteriorly. These organs in Þ. Ceres are of great
interest, and need further investigation, which IT hope that the expected arrival of a large
number of specimens from Ceylon will permit of. It is possible that these gland-masses,
with their accompanying tract of glandular matter, may be a foreshadowing of the
segment-organs in Annelids, which, in the leech at least, as is well known, make their
appearance in development as solid masses of tissue, and subsequently hecome holiow

* Muscular System.—Great stress has been: laid by various authors on the supposed

fact that whilst in Annelids, Nematoids, Trematodes, and, in fact, all higher worms, the

external coat of the body was arranged circularly, and the internal longitudinally, in

Turbellarians the reyerse was the case; and the statement has been made in such a

form that it really appeared as if aw inversion. of the muscular coats must be supposed

in order to get, at the proper homological relations of the muscular structures. And
