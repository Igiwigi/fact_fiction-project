trees were covered with a fungus, the threads of which forced themselves between the
epidermal cells into the root itself, which in such cases had no hairs, but similar bodies
were found external to the fungus-mantle, which prolonged into threads among the
particles of soil. FRanx concluded that the chlorophyllous tree acquires its soil
nutriment through the agency of the fungus.

Such a mode of accumulation by some green-leaved plants, obviously allies them
in this respect very closely to fungi themselves; indeed, it is by an action on
the soil which characterises non-chlorophyllous plants, that the chlorophyllous plant
acquires its soil-supplies of nutriment. But inasmuch as, in the cases observed, the
action was most marked in the surface layers of soil rich in humus, and it is stated
that the development has not been observed on the roots of any herbaceous plants,
the facts so far recorded do not aid us in the explanation of the acquirement of
nitrogen by deep and strong rooted Leguminoste from raw clay subsoils. Still, in view
of the office within the soil which is by some attributed to micro-organisms, and other
low forms, the observations are not without interest.

It is admitted that existing evidence on the various points which have been referred
to is insufficient to explain the source of the whole of the nitrogen of the Leguminosz.

The question arises, therefore, whether the free nitrogen of the atmosphere is fixed,
either by the plant, under the influence of electricity or otherwise, or within the soil,
by the agency either of electricity or of micro-organisms ? We believe that the
results of BoussinGAautr, and those obtained in conjunction with the late Dr. Puen at
Rothamsted, are conclusive against the supposition of the fixation of free nitrogen
