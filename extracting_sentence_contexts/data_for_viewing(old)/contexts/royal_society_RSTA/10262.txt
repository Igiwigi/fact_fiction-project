explanation, however, suggests itself,—the blue colour might be due to independent
radiation from discrete spheres (or molecules) of silver so far apart as not to form an
optically homogeneous medium. The intensity of the emitted light would then be
proportional to («*+4*)/d§ (in the case of spheres, or («?+48”)/\ in the case of
molecules). Further, the blue colour would be equally visible if the light illuminating
the discrete spheres (or molecules) entered the silver glass from the air side or the
clear glass side ; and this is not the case.

It is of interest to notice that while each individual sphere in glass radiates out
light of an intensity proportional to (a’+48”)/M, a surface separating a glass, containing
many of the spheres to a wave-length of light, from a region of the same glass in
which no spheres are present, reflects light with an intensity proportional to «°+ 46’.
This is due to the fact that the number of spheres (on the reflecting surface), the
phase of the forced vibrations of which lies at any instant between given limits, is
proportional to \*; so that the intensity of the reflected light is proportional to \*
times the intensity of the light emitted by a single sphere.

8. Diffusions of Copper. The Nature and Form of the Suspended Particles.

We proceed to discuss the colours produced by diffused particles of copper in order
to discover the cause of colour of copper ruby glass. The values of the expression
nr’ [pd for v = 1°56, v = 1°5, and »y = 1°0 given in Table IL., are plotted in fig. 6, the
maxima being determined as in the case of fig. 1 (ef §5 above). As in the case of
silver, these curves should fairly accurately represent the absorptions produced by
copper spheres in glass v = 1°56, in glass » = 1°5, and by copper spheres or molecules
