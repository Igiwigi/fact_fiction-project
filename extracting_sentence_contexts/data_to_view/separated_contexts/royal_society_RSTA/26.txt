The surface y, + ¢ As), &e., is

‘scontinuous values for the fluxions of y, + 4A gi, Yg + 4A cYay

therefore one in which di
&c., would appear in the equations (10), Art. 18 ; and therefore that equation cannot

be satisfied by these values. Hence Ag is not the same operation as Ay. ae]

Observe that the whole point of the proof consists in the fact that the As variations
are sufficiently continuous, notwithstanding the discontinuity in the highest fluxions. To complete the proof, it only remains to show that the surface V’, for which &U = 0,
satisfies the equations (10), Art. 18, for every point of the region 8. Suppose that it did
not do so for a portion S, of S. Takea compound surface made up of V, over 8, and V’
over § — S,, where V, is the synclastic surface, having at all points of the boundary of
S, the same values of Ay;, AY, &c., and all but their highest fluxions, as those of the
function V’..
