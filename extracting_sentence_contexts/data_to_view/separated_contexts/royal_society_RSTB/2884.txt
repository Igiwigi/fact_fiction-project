The respirations now grow less and less frequent, and are of a convulsive
nature, and then finally cease, and then death takes place. If, on the other hand, the dose is still less, and the vaso-motor centre begins to
recover its tone, the blood pressure rises slowly once more, and coincidently the
respirations improve in frequency, and recovery takes place in spite of complete
incoagulability of the blood, and well-marked visceral hemorrhages. All the facts
recorded can, then, be explained as a result of paralysis of the central vaso-motor
centre, and in no other way. III. Action on the Respiratory Centre.
