This was removed from the viscid mother liquor by absorption of the latter in a
porous tile, which was then broken up and extracted with water. This extract
evidently still contained far more of the substance than could be readily separated in a
crystalline condition. From nearly a kilogramme of the plant only about 25 gramme
of crystalline material was extracted, but by working up about 10 kilogrammes of the
plant a quantity sufficient for analysis was eventually obtained.

The substance thus prepared proved to be a glucoside, which it is proposed to
name Jotusin. It was re-crystallised from hot alcohol, and was thus obtained in needles
having a very faint yellow colour. It is bitter to the taste, and does not reduce
Frurine’s solution except after long boiling. It has no definite melting point, but
decomposes when slowly heated. Unlike quercitrin and other similar glucosides of
colouring matters, lotusin is not precipitated by lead acetate, a fact which we have
utilised in purifying it.

With the exception of amygdalin, lotusin is the only glucoside definitely known
which furnishes prussic acid as a decomposition product.

Combustions of specially purified material, dried at 100° C. until of constant
weight, gave the following results :—
