We therefore defer evaluation of fluxes to
§8, after we clarify the modes. To achieve that, some further transformation of the nonlinear
contributions is necessary. Specifically, by extracting the irreducible part of the rank-three tensor,
and taking into account the fact that o is trace-free, we transform Aplin. (6.18) as follows:

Aplin = ~ VR aC 9)(CaCgCy)(GapdyT) + —— O ~ wict- 14C? + 35)Cu(oupdgT). (6.29)
A similar transformation of Agin (6.19) yields
Agin= 5 eo 7)(CaCpCy) (Ga dpuy)
+—“ (4 _ act 4.35¢ (a up + Opa — 25 ayy) (6.30)
25p/RT aff \ Calls Bia Babyy } °
Furthermore, one immediately recognizes that Agia (6.22) and Agi (6.23) are composed of two
terms with the structure of the second and third primary modes,
i M
agin = ~ 5c —7)(CaCp) (9p) Fya) — 5p “Cc —10C? + 15)qudgope (6.31)
and M
Sip = ~ 5a ~ WCC BNA %eP) — Fe AE (Ct =10C? + 15)(qu dup). (6.32)

Finally, the term Aplin (6.26) can be transformed as follows:
Aplin — eee 7)(CaCp)oap(dy Uy) +7 aa —10C? + 15)oapdgita + Anin (6.33)
and
Ago = 55 MT (CaCpCyCa) — (CaCy)8pa — (CaCy Bun — (CC) py

— (CpCy) Say — (CaCg)dyx. — (Cy Cy) dap (Gap Ay ua). (6.34)

7. Invariance defect as a superposition of eight modes

After transforming various nonlinear contributions, it now becomes easier to recognize the
structure of the invariance defect as a superposition of eight modes,

8
Age = °K, (7.1)
i=1

which we specify below.


(a) Primary mode xc

The mode

KO = MPO} FO (7.2)

is associated with the rank-three tensor po) , and was already identified from the analysis of the

linear part of the invariance defect (see (6.10)),

PU, = (CaCpCy). (7.3)

Collecting pertinent contributions from (6.10), (6.16) and (6.17), and taking into account that
tensor (7.3) is symmetric and traceless, we get the extension of the frequency associated with
this mode into the nonlinear domain,

a 1 1 . RT
Fy = (<a) (9) Gap) _ (==) (Fup 9.0ry) _ (=) (Cup dy P), (7.4)

where we have introduced shorthand notation (Aggy) for the symmetrized trace-free generic
tensor of rank three.
