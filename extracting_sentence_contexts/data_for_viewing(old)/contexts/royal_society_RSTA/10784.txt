Ever since the are was first assumed to have a back E.M.F., speculation has been
rife as to its cause and its location in the are. So long as the value assigned to it
was of the order of 40 volts, and it was supposed to be located only at the crater
surface, there was great difficulty in offering any consistent explanation of it. It
remains, therefore, to consider whether the new facts set forth in this paper render
the matter more susceptible of a satisfactory explanation.

So far as the resistance of the are is concerned, there seem to be no difficulties, the
known relations between the size and shape of the vapour column, the size of the
craters, the current, and the are length. explain the observed changes in resistance
when the two latter variables are altered. The magnitude of the resistance of the
vapour column and of the contacts between it and the electrodes are not such as to
offer serious difficulties, nor does the fact that they are altered by the presence of
foreign bodies.

Any explanation of the back E.M.F. of the are as a whole must, in the light ot
the results given in the last section, account for the existence of two unequal E.M.F.’s
of opposite signs, of which the larger opposes the flow of the current. The observed
back E.M.F. of the are is the resultant of these two, their values being of the order
of 17 volts and 6 volts respectively in the solid arc. The existence of two E.M.EF.’s
of opposite signs, situated at or near the electrodes, considerably simplifies matters,
since any explanation which would account for a back E.M.F. in the direction
carbon-to-vapour would probably also explain a forward E.M.F. vapour-to-carbon.
These E.M.F.’s are probably either due to a polarisation at the electrodes or to
thermo-electric forces. The polarisation E.M.F.’s include those due to chemical
