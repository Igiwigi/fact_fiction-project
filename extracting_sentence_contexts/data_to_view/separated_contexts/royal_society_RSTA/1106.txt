The last row in this table shows the shear on the boundary at the mid-section, which
should be zero, and gives an idea of the magnitude of the residual stresses neglected. Tn the face of this, close agreement with the exact values cannot be expected. In fact,
as fig. 7 shows, the errors increase rapidly after 4 = 0-2, until for 4 = 0-5 the actual
