Let (T(t))¢>0 be a Co-sentigroup on a Banach space X. Assume either that there exist
p€[1,00) and C > 0 such that

Then o(T) < —(pC)“}. Note that the existence of constants C such that (2.8) and (2.9) hold would already follow from
the fact that all orbits (or weak orbits) of (T(é));>0 lie in an L?-space, by a simple application of the
closed graph theorem. Observe also that the estimate w(T) < —(pC)-! is optimal in the sense that
«(T) equals the infimum of the numbers —(pC)"1, with C > 0 running over all constants for which
(2.8) holds with respect to an equivalent norm; see [3, p. 82]. For other results of this type and relevant ideas, we refer the reader to [1], [3, Ch. 3], and to
[47].
