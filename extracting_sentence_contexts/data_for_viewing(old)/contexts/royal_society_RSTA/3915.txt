a natural lead carbonate mineral worldwide distributed, whereas the mineral hydrocerussite
is extremely rare and therefore rarely used as a pigment source [7]. In the Andean region, the
Jesuit Father Bernabé Cobo reported in 1653 on the occurrence of lead carbonate mines in Juli
and Azangaro in the Viceroyalty of Peru [8]. These facts suggest a mineral source for the cerussite
identified in the priming layer of the sample. The Raman spectrum of the red bole layer (figure 3b)
showed the characteristic bands of haematite («-Fe2O3) at 225, 294, 411, 611 and 1320cm7!,
together with a weak band at 660cm™! that has been reported for disordered structures in
natural haematite [9,10]. The band at 1010cm~! in the Raman spectrum of the preparation layer
(figure 3c) is characteristic of gypsum [11]. These results and SEM-EDS analysis of each layer are
in accordance with those previously reported for the stratigraphic analysis of a green sample from
the veil of the sculpture of the Virgin of Copacabana [3].

The Raman spectrum of the red pigment layer (figure 4) showed bands at 469, 570, 1110, 1256,
1315, 1485 and 1645 cm"!, consistent with those reported for carmine, a red lake pigment prepared
from carminic acid, the principal component of the organic dyestuff obtained from the insect
Dactylopius coccus Costa [12]. Bands at 674, 785, 970 and 1010cm™ in the Raman spectrum may
