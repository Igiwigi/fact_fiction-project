The ‘giant cell’ described above entirely disappears during this condensation of the
embryo, leaving no trace. It is possible that the two events are correlated, neither giant cell
nor shrinkage of the vesicle occurs in P. moseleyi or P. sedgwicki, and the giant cell has never
been found after the sudden condensation of the embryo. No further facts concerning this cell
have been obtained. Possibly it is a gland cell which influences the osmotic relations of the
embryo, and on discharge causes a reduction in the osmotic pressure within the vesicle and
consequently the shrinkage. The mouth-anus opens just after the shrinkage (see p. 517),
but appears to be closed until then by a fine sheet of protoplasm, and so its opening cannot
cause the reduction in internal pressure.
