Ti-in-zircon temperatures of the same zones within zircon crystals. Owing to the slow diffusion
of Ti in zircon, these represent crystallization temperatures for the sampled volume of zircon
[68,69]. The argument for tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years [66] or even
millions of years [67] of warm storage recorded in zircon is based on groups of zircon analyses
from individual samples that yield high (greater than 750°C) crystallization temperatures which
also have overlapping ages spanning long periods of time [66,67]. The presence of zircon
crystallizing at high temperatures indicates that the region(s) of the magma reservoir supplying
crystals to the eruptions studied included at least some melt at high temperature in order to
allow crystallization. However, given the variations in crystallinity expected across a magma
reservoir in the mush model—and the temperature variations implied by those variations—it

is not clear how much of the reservoir needs to be at high temperature at a particular time of : 3
zircon crystallization. In fact, the zircon datasets presented in each of these studies also include (8

and
many crystals that yield lower temperatures (less than 750°C) with ages that also overlap with 7

those showing high-temperature crystallization (figure 4a). In addition, these datasets do not
require that the presence of high temperature melt at any given location be continuous over the
entire span of zircon crystallization ages. SIMS measurements of U-Th and U-Pb crystallization
ages for young zircon are relatively imprecise compared to TIMS measurements or to U-Pb on
older zircon, which can obscure the details of the crystallization history and therefore thermal
history. Modelling of the effect of uncertainty in zircon ages on a measured age versus Ti-in-zircon
temperature distribution shows that, given typical analytical uncertainties for SIMS data, it is not
possible to resolve multiple short-duration peaks in temperature from an isothermal or monotonic
