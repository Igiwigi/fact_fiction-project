attention has been again drawn to the subject by the impor-
tant controversy which has lately been carried on between Mr.
Muxxar and Mr. Joan Davy, respecting the nature of mu-
riatic and oxymuriatic acids; and I have been induced, by
some hints which the discussion has suggested, not only to
repeat the principal experiments described in my memoir, but
to institute others, with the adyantage of a more perfect appa-
ratus than I then possessed, and of greater experience in the
management of these delicate processes.

This repetition of my former labours has discovered to me
an instance, in which I have failed in drawing the proper con-
clusion from facts. In two comparative experiments on the
electrization of equal quantities of muriatic acid gas, the one

its natural tate, I found a difference of not more than one per
cent. in the hydrogen evolved, relatively to the original bulk
of the gas,* Yet, notwithstanding these results, I have ex-
