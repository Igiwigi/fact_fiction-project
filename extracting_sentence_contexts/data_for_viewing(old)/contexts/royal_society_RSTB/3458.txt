each is formed by the fusion of potential gametes. This conclusion is based on the
following evidence :—

1. At the stage of fig. 21 (the last simultaneous division of the free nuclei
being completed), the nuclei are of the same generation—the eleventh from
the macrospore-nucleus.

2. They are all alike in all visible characters.

3. Shortly before septation commences they show differences in size and staining
capacity ; but they all pass through the same series of changes and
ultimately are again all alike, The observed differences are due to the
fact that these changes commence at the micropylar end sooner than in the
lower part of the sac.

4. When septation is completed some compartments contain few nuclei (six or
less); others a larger number. The latter are normally confined to the
lower three-fourths of the sac; the former may occur anywhere, though
they usually fill the upper fourth of the sac and are either absent from or
much less abundantly developed in the lower three-fourths.

5. In compartments containing less than six, wherever they may be situated, the
nuclei do not fuse, but remain free ; these are functional gametes. Fusion
oceurs only in those compartments in which the nuclei are in greater
number ; a sterile tissue is thus formed.
