The Evolution of the Species. The relationships of the species within the genera remain to be considered. There
are but few forms of the genera Pachydera, Murinopsia and Decurtaria, in fact the

last genus contains but the single species D. [Semiescharipora] cornuta (Beissel) and
therefore need not be further considered. Pachydera contains two species: P. grandis, Marsson, from the zone of
B. mucronata of Riigen, and its derivative P. densa, Lang, from the Danian of Faxe. Pachydera was seen to differ from Pelmatopora in haying fewer coste and a tubular
aperture; so these tendencies are intensified during evolution; and P. densa, has,
if anything, a more tubular aperture than P. grandis, typically five costee compared
with typically eight in P. grandis, and (catagenetically) fewer pelmata on each costa.
