Another feature in brachycephalics is that Exx1or Smrrn’s lunate sulcus, if present,
has often the shape of a high, vertical crescent than in dolichocephalics, and thus may
resemble more the simian shape. Postauricular shortness of the skull, together with its
greater height, seems to be responsible also for these features. Furthermore CUNNING-
HAM’S Rolandic angle (the frontal angle between the Rolandic fissure and its tangent on
the dorso-medial wall) as well as my Rolandic angle (between this fissure and the lateral
horizontal) are larger in the brachycephalics ; a result of the greater steepness of the
central sulcus.

That this is also correlated with the postauricular shortening and greater height
appears from the fact that while the ventral end of the central sulcus practically has the
same topographical relation in both sorts of brains its upper end has shifted somewhat
forward in brachycephalics, a fact important for cranio-cerebral topography and well
known to brain surgeons.

Other features correlated with the postauricular shortening are the sharper curve of the intraparietal
and the more constant development of the so-called ascending branches of the superior temporal, the
angular, the r. ascendens temp. sup. proper and the anterior occipital sulci of SHELLSHEAR (1927).

But this is not conspicuous on the photographs which should for this purpose have been taken from
another direction.

On the frontal lobe the differences are not so striking. Still the three sagittal fissures
are easier to study, especially the midfrontal in dolichocephalics.
