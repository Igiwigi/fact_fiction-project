become very definite when we ascend to some of the higher developments of the ligneous
zone which we shall find amongst these Lepidodendroid plants.

If T am correct in these determinations, no question can arise as to the cortical nature

X of the thick, investing, and more external layers, with their prevalence of prosenchyma,
8 80 characteristic of Lycopodiaceous cortical structures. We also see that the retention
2 on the epiderm of portions of the bases of the leaves hides what should otherwise
=> represent the regularly arranged leaf-scars seen in the common Lepidodendroid stems.
Whether, in the species under consideration, these leaf-petioles were persistent, or
© whether, as the stem advanced in age, they fell off, leaving a natural cicatrix of the forms
2 represented in fig. 6, is doubtful; but my present belief is that the latter was the case,
& and that the fact explains why we only find such examples as I have figured of compa-
<£ ratively small size.
Z L have sections of one example of the above type from South Owram, near Halifax,
and for which I am indebted to Mr. Nz1.D of Oldham, in which the cellular element
-2 of the medullary axis is reduced to its minimum. The axis consists mainly of barred
S vessels; nevertheless cells exist in sufficient numbers to demonstrate the identity of the
E two forms. The next modification of the Lepidodendroid type to which I would call
EZ attention is one that Mr. Bixxgy has included, together with that which I have just de-
= 8cribed, in his memoir on Sigillaria already referred to, but which I agree with Mr.
E CanrvTans in regarding as a distinct plant. None of the specimens of it which I have
EZ had the opportunity of studying exhibit the ontermost layer of the bark; consequently
= I know nothing of its external contour, but the portions which I possess are interesting
and instructive. Plate XXYV. fig. 8 represents a transverse s8ection of the central axis
