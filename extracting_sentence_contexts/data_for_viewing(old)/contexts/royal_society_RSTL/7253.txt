or as being similar to the equation which expresses the relation existing between mer-
curous chloride and its elements,

x32 =ax2+23.
Or again, it may also be regarded as identical in form with the symbols of chlorine and
of nitrogen; in which case the above equation is thus expressed,

2ux6, =%x*+ gr,
and is similar to the equation which connects the symbols of the chloride of iodine with
those of chlorine and iodine, -

2axw=ux? + wa?.
And, lastly, the facts are not even inconsistent with the assumption that the 8ymbol of
sver is identical in form with the symbols of oxygen and suIphur, 8 that

ax'gr=ax+i,
which is similar to the equation which connects the symbol of the bisulphide of chlorine
with the symbols of its elements

ax =ux2 + 0.

The symbols of silyer and its compounds appear, on the two more probable hypotheses,
as follows:

Hypothesis I. W=A, X=23;.
