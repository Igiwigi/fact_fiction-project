axis agrees with FRESNEL's section, but which, as we go from 6? to 16 away from
that axis, differs from that section, and lies outside the section.

This result, viz. : that on going away from the maximum radins vector the curye
given by experiment should lie outside that given by theory, is exactly that to which
we have been led by the work for the second prism.

The eutting of the crystal would nob allow of observations being taken near the
minor axis of the ellipse, in the case of the firs prism.

Of course, it has here been asswmed that the sections of the 8urface of wave
slowness, by the principal planes, are curves of the same kind ; or rather the results of
experiment lead to that as a fact.

Lord Ravimen's theory needs no further discussion here, for his curye being the
inverse of an ellipse, always lies outside the ellipse with the same axes, and therefore
cannot agree with experiment.

Section IX.—Possibility of an Error in the Position of the Crystallographic Azes n
diseussed.—No Section of the Surface of Wave Slowness in FRESNEL's Theory can
agree with the experimental Results. |

But the possibility remains that there is an error in the determination of the Posi-
tion of the faces of the prisms, especially in the second case, with respect to the
crystallographic axes.
