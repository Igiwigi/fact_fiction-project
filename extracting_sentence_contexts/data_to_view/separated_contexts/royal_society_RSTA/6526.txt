As I have now completed the calculations up to a point beyond which it
would be difficult to go, and where I believe but little on which the perfection of the
instrument practically depends remains to be found, I wish, without further delay, to
explain the formule I have obtained. Owing to the large number of variables, and the complicated manner in which they
are involved, it would be difficult by any direct mathematical process to find the best
value for every one at the same time; what I have done is to take the variations, one

gt two ata time, in such an order that those taken later shall require little or no
Snodification of the results previously found.

g It is evident that the quickness of the instrument, whatever proportions may be
ogiven to it, will increase as the sensitive plate is diminished in thickness ; and later on
it will be shown that, besides the quickness, the ultimate sensibility, 7.Â¢., the deviation
for a given rate of radiation, may also be increased as the thickness is diminished. It
may, therefore, be taken as a fact that, the thinner the plate, the more sensitive will
be the instrument. When I began the calculations I did not think it likely that a
plate composed of metals so difficult to work could be made much less than } mm.
thick, and, accordingly, that has been assumed as one starting point. I have found,
however, not the slightest difficulty in producing plates thinner than this, but I have
in what follows taken this quantity as the thickness when wishing to find the nume-

vical values given by the formule.
