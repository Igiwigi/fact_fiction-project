thermopile, especially as their defects are so well known, and their applicability so
limited, although each possesses distinct advantages for certain purposes.

Platinum wire is well fitted for use as a temperature standard, it is still more
admirably fitted for practical use in any experiments where accuracy is required. ‘This
arises chiefly from its adaptability. A length of wire is cut off and disposed in any
way which may happen to be most convenient for the desired purpose. The observa-
tions are simple and rapid, the corrections small and easily applied, the sources of
error less than with any other kind of thermometer and more easily avoided. For
radiation experiments it may be made more sensitive than the thermopile (cf. LANGLEY’s
Bolometer) ; owing to its great sensitiveness, it may be used to measure rapidly varying
temperature without inaccuracy ; this is often desirable, as in calorimetry by method
of cooling. There is, in fact, hardly any experimental investigation in which the
measurement of temperature is necessary, which may not be more accurately and
simply effected by means of a suitable platinum wire thermometer.

[The results of the investigation considered as a research on the resistance-
variation of metals tend to prove the existence of minute irregularities which
