Their be-
haviour is, in fact, essentially similar to that shown by mineral oils. The molecules of
these substances must therefore be attached to the surface comparatively weakly so
that the film of lubricant is easily broken down by the applied load. This view is
supported by the fact that the addition of a trace of cetyl alcohol was ineffective in
changing the nature of the sliding of a mineral oil. In contrast to the behaviour of a

fatty acid, this substance is unable to form a very protective adsorbed layer on the
surface. When an alcohol or a hydrocarbon is present on the surface in the solid state,
however, continuous sliding does occur.
