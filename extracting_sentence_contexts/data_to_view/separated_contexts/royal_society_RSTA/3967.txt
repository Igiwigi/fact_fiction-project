Routine ionospheric soundings have been made in the UK since 20 September 1932, initially
at the Radio Research Station at Ditton Park near Slough and subsequently at the Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory in Chilton, Oxfordshire, UK [7]. Short-wave (1 MHz to approx. 20 MHz)
radio pulses are transmitted and received at the same location. These measurements exploit the
fact that the resonant frequency of ionospheric electrons (f, Hz) is proportional to the square-root
of the electron concentration (N, m~?) with the relation f ~9,/N. A radio signal is returned from
the ionosphere when the frequency of the radio pulse matches the resonant frequency of the local
electrons. Since the density of ionization varies with height due to the relative extent with which
solar radiation over the EUV and X-ray spectrum can penetrate the atmosphere, a height profile
of ionization can be built up by transmitting short-wave radio pulses over a range of frequencies
corresponding to the range of ionospheric resonant frequencies.
