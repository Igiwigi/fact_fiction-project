a first Approximation to the Orbit of a Comet. 125

If we reflect on the suppositions made by NEwrTox for sim=-
plifying the method of finding a comet's trajectory, it must be
admitted that they seem judicious, and. that they are founded
in fact. In the usual circumstances in which terrestrial obser-
vations are made, there is no doubt that the real path of a
comet, for a short time at least, differs little from a straight

A Â© line, and that the motion is nearly uniform. Yet the problem
J grounded on these suppositions, although it has been often
S applied, has never, in any instance, led to a satisfactory deter-
S mination of a comet's orbit.
