If, then, the growth of either of these disks had been
checked within the first zone in which its annular canal becomes double, it would
have been accounted as belonging to the simpler type; and the wide variation which

canals, the superficial cells are not always clearly marked-off from its columnar
cavities; for instead of being separated by floors formed by the expanded summits

the intermediate substance, 80 as to be quite continuous with them.
