one smacks a stubborn vending machine or smells rotting
milk. We think that moralizing requires not just a single
emotional response on a single occasion, but a set of emotion-
al dispositions that include both other- and self-directed
emotions. Bad behaviours are those that anger or repel us
in others and also cause guilt and shame when we do them
ourselves. The behaviour of a vending machine and that of
rotting milk would not dispose us to experience guilt and
shame; these are not behaviours we relate to by means of
our ability to perform them ourselves. Second, one might
object that moral judgements sometimes come apart from
emotions, as when we coolly judge that a punishment is war-
ranted despite the fact that we are upset by the pain that it
causes. Here, we think that introspection may mislead us:
when compassion is overridden by justice, it may not be
cool reason at play, but indeed strong emotion; the act of
punishment itself may not be occasioned by rage, but, in
such cases, we would be enraged if justice was not meted
out; we tolerate suffering in a perpetrator, because of prior
outrage towards the crime or a standing disposition to find
such crimes outrageous.

In summary, we propose that moral badness is grounded
in other- and self-directed emotions, each of which impels
certain actions. For other more specific moral concepts, such
