ture. Self-control has important pro-social implications.
Restraining anger, being diplomatic, sharing resources, fulfill-
ing obligations and a host of other cooperative acts require
varying degrees of self-control. Very likely, our self-control
capacity evolved to allow us to reap the long-term benefits of
cooperation while forgoing smaller short-term gains.

Criticisms have been levelled at the notion of self-control as
a limited, domain-general resource; an idea referred to as ego-
depletion. Ego-depletion has typically been assessed using
sequentially presented, presumably unrelated tasks of self-
control. For example, resisting sweets (task 1) followed by the
Stroop test (task 2). The fact that task 1 appeared to signifi-
cantly impair task 2, suggested that they were drawing from
a single, limited, domain-general source. However, studies
showing ego-depletion effects have been called into question (a) Material resource
([8,9]; however see [10] for reply]).

The ultimate outcome of the ego-depletion controversy,
however, is not central to the resource analogy as it is being
employed here. Instead, it is the far less controversial
notion of cognitive fatigue resulting from time-on-task or pro-
cessing overload that is important [11,12]. Variants of this (b) Psychological resource
effect have been demonstrated across many contexts such Start with a raw psychological state (e.g. loyalty). Ritually
as: (i) studentsâ€™ standardized test results being poorer when process the state (e.g. an initiation ritual) creating a useable
