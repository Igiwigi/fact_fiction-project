Professor Sotias
had arrived, from an examination of the geological features of the earth, at a
conclusion very similar to that to which I had been led from theoretical
considerations : he had detected an axis of symmetry, other than the axis of rotation,
in the earth’s figure, and expressed the opinion that ‘the pear-shaped form, now that
it was pointed out, became obvious to mere inspection: it was a geographical fact,
and not a speculation.”

The axis of Professor Sonias’ pear does not, however, coincide with that which I
tentatively put forward in the above paper, and the object of this note is to accept
the alteration suggested by his paper. The conclusion reached in his paper is that
the axis of symmetry of the pear-shaped figure passes through a point of latitude
and longitude about 6° N. by 30° E. Thus Africa—the continent whose mean height
above sea-level is greatest—must be taken to be the centre of the “Land
Hemisphere ” in fig. 1 of my paper, while the protuberance which formed the stalk
of the pear is submerged in the Pacific Ocean, which now forms the “ Water
Hemisphere.” Almost the only remaining evidence of the existence of this
protuberance is the fact that the axis of the pear coincides with the earth’s greatest
diameter. The great circle of earthquake-centres suggested in § 38 of my paper is
to be replaced by the line of Pacific folding ; this approximately forms a small circle
(of radius about 80°) which almost coincides with the proposed great-circle in the
northern hemisphere. Further details of Professor Souuas’ view will be found in his
paper (The Figure of the Earth,” ‘Quart.
