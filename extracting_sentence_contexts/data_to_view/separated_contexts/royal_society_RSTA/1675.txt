At shock
formation time, our simulations show that the upstream ions have a certain thermal distribution,
which will be maintained after reflection. An ion with velocity vo, different from 0, will thus
acquire a velocity 2v; + vg upon reflection. This will result in the fact that a few ions have higher
energies with respect to the theoretical model.

3. Summary

We presented two-dimensional PIC simulations modelling the interaction of a near-infrared
intense laser pulse with the ICF corona plasma. A hole-boring driven shock is generated around
the critical density.
