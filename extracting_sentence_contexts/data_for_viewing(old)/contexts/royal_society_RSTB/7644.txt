CHEMICAL BASIS OF MORPHOGENESIS 71

It is probable that the forms of various nearly spherical structures, such as radiolarian
skeletons, are closely related to these spherical harmonic patterns. The most important
application of the theory seems, however, to be to the gastrulation of a blastula. Suppose
that the chemical data, including the chemical wave-length, remain constant as the radius
of the blastula increases. To be quite specific suppose that

ee a a 4,6 Sra ay a — 9

With these values the system is quite stable so long as the radius is less than about 2. Near
this point, however, the harmonics of degree 1 begin to develop and a pattern of form (12-5)
with my) = 1 makes its appearance. Making use of the facts that

P%(cos#) = cos#, Pi(cos#) = Py! (cos@) = sin#,
it is seen that XY —A is of the form
X—h = Acos+Bsin@ cosd+Csin@ sing, (12-6)

which may also be interpreted as

X—h= A’ cos’, (12-7)
where 0’ is the angle which the radius #, 6 makes with the fixed direction having direction
cosines proportional to B, C, A and A’ = ,/(A?+ B?+C?).

The outcome of the analysis therefore is quite simply this. Under certain not very
