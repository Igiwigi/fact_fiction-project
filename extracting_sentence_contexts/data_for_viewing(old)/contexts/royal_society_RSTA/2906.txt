contribution to AI, and core to cybernetics, is the emphasis on feedback loops, which imply the
gaining of information about how the other system responds to one’s attempts to influence it,
followed by adapting one’s own behaviour to be more successful [17]. The feedback loop enables
adaptive behaviour, depending on the acuity of the observing agent that is trying to achieve

its goal.

The cybernetic understanding of regulation makes a lot of sense, but as observed above it : 8
takes an external perspective on law, missing out on the domain specificity of law and the force
of law. The fact that lawyers may take such an external perspective does not turn it into an [=
internal perspective; it rather means that such lawyers fail to distinguish between a sociological or : S
cybernetic account of law and the domain-specific operations of legal normativity which is closely : 2
aligned with the concept and the rule of law. Or, it means that lawyers are capable of switching 14
between an internal and an external perspective—which I believe to be a very good exercise. To : _
better understand both law and the rule of law, we need a mitigated internal perspective that ane]
clarifies where and how the operations of law differ from the operations of cybernetic regulation. 7s

From the perspective of the rule of law ‘legal regulation’ is a subset of law and as such it is : 3
constrained by the legality principle, meaning that such regulation is both more and less than the ical

cybernetic understanding of regulation purports. Law, including ‘legal regulation’, is focused not
merely on the modification of behaviour, but on coordinating, prohibiting and enabling action
