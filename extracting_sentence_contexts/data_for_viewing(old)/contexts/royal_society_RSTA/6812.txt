corresponding with the second of (ii)

also (dy/dr), is related with (0y/dz), by (11) B as before: but now in place of the first
of (ii) we must employ

oy
(5 al = &(x1 —Xe) + (1—&) (Xo —Xa)s (v)

as the closest approximation which is practicable. Substituting in (30) we have an
equation in which 7, & Wp, (v7) ps (v2) p are known, and between this and (28) y, may be
eliminated in the manner of § 21.

When the point 8 is also ‘fictitious’ (figure 94), yg has also to be eliminated, and it is
difficult to obtain an independent expression for this quantity. The best procedure in
this case would seem to be substitution of the equivalent relation

cet ae :
%¥+| 52-73, [x= 0 (12) A

for the second of (12), leading to a corresponding substitution of

a\2 a,
Fy = tit ts—2h0+(5) (a+ hs—2h0) 555 (Ha-Ha)
a\* a
+(5) (X2-+X4—2No) — 955 (X2—Xa) = 0 (28) A
