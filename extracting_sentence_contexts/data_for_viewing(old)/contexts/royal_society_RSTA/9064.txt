Scruster’s earlier memoir, those by Frrrscue,* G. W. WaALKeER,t and vAN BemmMevent
may be noted here. The two former authors confined themselves to the solar diurnal
magnetic variations, but VAN BEMMELEN broke fresh ground by applying harmonic
analysis also to the lunar diurnal variations. The importance of the latter was
fully recognized by both Batrour Srewarr and Scuusrer, who, in his second
memoir (p. 181), urged the desirability of further study of them.

Some of the above, and other, writers reached conclusions adverse to the SrEwART-
Scuuster theory, partly owing to the fact that the results of their analyses of
the observational data differed from Scuusrer’s. The present paper embodies an
attempt to resolve the points in dispute, and to remove other obscurities in the
theory. New analyses are made both of the solar and lunar diurnal magnetic
variations, so that the chief facts relating to each may be discussed together. It is
taken as axiomatic, in view of the general resemblance between the two phenomena,
that in the main the same theory and similar mechanisms must apply to each.
Various modifications of ScuustTER’s hypotheses and results are found to be necessary,
but the essential points of the theory are confirmed by this investigation.

The discussion of the third and fourth, as well as the 24- and 12-hour, harmonics
in the magnetic variations is one of the more novel features of this paper :
previous discussions have generally been confined to the diurnal and semi-diurnal
components, and doubts have been cast on the value of the higher frequency terms,
which I hope the present investigation will remove. In the case of the lunar
variations, only the semi-diurnal term has hitherto been used; this, however, was
because, while other harmonics are present, their phases vary through a multiple of
