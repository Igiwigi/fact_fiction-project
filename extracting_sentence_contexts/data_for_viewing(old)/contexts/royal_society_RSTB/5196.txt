the power which these fishes possessed of sustaining life outside the water by supposing
that they carried with them, in reservoirs at the sides of the head, supplies of water by
which the gills were kept moist. On the other hand, Tayior (1831) and specially
Day (1868) and Hyrv1 (1863) showed, as the result of close observation, that the reservoirs
in question contained little or no water, and that the fish, when kept in tanks or globes,
could be seen to come to the top at intervals and emit air-bubbles. It was, therefore,
clear that the reservoirs in question contained not water but air, and that the fish must
be regarded as true air-breathers.

The fact that certain fish, such as Protopterus in Africa, Lepidosiren in 8. America and
Ceralodus in Australia, possess organs for breathing air as well as gills for respiring in water
is well known ; the structure and habits of these ‘* double-breathers ” (Dipnoi) form an
integral part of the instruction given in every elementary course of Zoology. But the
air-breathing organs of the Dipnoi are homologous with the lungs of the higher vertebrates,
and the Dipnoi must be regarded as comparatively unchanged survivors from the time
when the Devonian fish were making their first attempt to invade the land, at a period
when no land-inhabiting air-breathing vertebrates existed.

The fresh-water fish of India are widely remote in systematic position from the
Dipnoi ; most of them retain the air-bladder (cf. text-fig. 1 B, p. 189) which corresponds
to the organ with which the Dipnoi breathe air, but they do not use the air-bladder for
this purpose. The organs which these fish employ for air-breathing are new develop-
