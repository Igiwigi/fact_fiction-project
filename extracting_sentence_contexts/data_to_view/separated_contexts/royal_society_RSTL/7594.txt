(22) But besides this most intimate and important connexion between the two
—the hypoglossal and the spinal-accessory—through the medium of their cells,
spinal-accessory nerve, as I formerly showed on seyeral occasions, has a separate ori
from the hypogloss@l nucleus; and I also showed that both the yagus and glosso
ryngeal nerves have cach a separate origin from the same source. These in i
facts have been fully confirmed by Dr. Jos Dax, of Boston, U.S.*. In birds
separate origin of the vagus nerve from the hypoglossal nucleus is s0 striking, that
well-made preparations it may be seen almost at a glanceF. In fishes T haye recen
discovered a beautiful and peculiarly interesting illustration of the same anatomical
In these animals there is no separate hypoglossal nerve, but the tongue is supplied by
branch of the vagus. Now I was very desirous of knowing what was the nature of
vagal nucleus in these animals, and of ascertaining whether it was a double or com-
pound nucleus consisting of the vagal and hypoglossal nuclei joined together.
