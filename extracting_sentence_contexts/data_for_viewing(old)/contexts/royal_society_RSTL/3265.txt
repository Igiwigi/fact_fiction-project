thickened, highly refracts light, and is often reddish-brown in colour; there is a
minute space, filled with a transparent and colourless fluid, between this membrane
and the membrane f; and finally the tunica granulosa (g') and retinacula (g?) pre-
sent the appearance of incipient liquefaction.

141. A synopsis in my former memoir exhibited seven successive stages in the
Formation of the ovum.(par. 292. Note.). In the present paper also, it will be conve-
nient to adopt the same plan of considering the oyum in successive stages. These,
however, occurring post coitum, will be stages of development. IT propose to consider
as the first stage, that represented in Plate V. fig. 93; and as the second stage, the
condition which is frequent when the oyum leaves the ovary (figs. 96. and 97.).

142. To obtain these facts, and have it in my power to state them with any degree
of confidence, and in the order of their occurrence, has been an undertaking of no
common difficulty ; and there did not exist, s0 far as I could discover, any recorded
observations belonging to this period that might be taken as a guide.

Locality in which the Ovum is fecundated.

143. As to the particular locality in which the oyum becomes susceptible of de-
velopment, physiologists are not agreed. Some maintain that it acquires this suscep-
tibility before it leaves the ovary; others that the change is not effected until after
its expulsion from that organ.

144. It is not my purpose to discuss the question whether contact of the seminal
