Each little slip (as many as three or four may sometimes occur in the
course of one single extensive tilt) ends as abruptly as it began. As a cumulative
result the arms eventually become slightly askew with respect to the body. The
fact that these body-lapses are individual and isolated, and not part of one continuous,
plastically yielding motion, raised the question whether they are indicative of
corresponding, discontinuous, labyrinthine alterations. We finally concluded that
they are purely muscular events, having no necessary relation to happenings within
the labyrinth. One reason for so thinking is that they also occur in a fully
delabyrinthized animal.
