15. But (in contrast to this) if the three conditions are satisfied, it may very well
happen that a fourth condition is satisfied ipso facto. To see how this is, imagine a
curve 9 on the scroll S(m, 2, p), or, to meet an objection which might be raised, say a
curve 9 the complete intersection of the scroll S(m, 2, p) by a plane or any other surface.
Every line whatever which meets the curves m, 2, p is a generating line of the scroll
S(m, n, p), and as snch will meet the curve 4; that is, in the case in question, G(m, 2, 7,9),
the lines which meet the curves m, 2, p, q, are the entire series of generating lines of the
scroll S(m, n,p), and they are thus infinite in number; so that in such case the question
does not arise of finding the number of the lines G(m, 2, p, q). The like remarks apply
to the lines G(m?, n, p), G(n?, n?), G(m?, n), and G(m#); but T will deyelope them some-
what more particularly as regards the lines G(m*).

16. Given a curve m, then (as in fact mentioned in the investigation for ND(m))
through any point whatever of the curve there can be drawn

(—m+2=)mP+m—2+M
lines meeting the curve in two other points, or say [mP+1M—2+I lines through three
points. But in general no one of these lines meets the curye in a fourth point ; that
is, we cannot through every point of the curve m draw a line through four points ; there
are, however, on the curye m2 a certain number ( =4G(m)) of points through which can
be drawn a line through four points, or line G(m*).

17. But the curve 1m may be such that through every point of the curve there passes
a line through four points. In fact, assxume any skew surface or scroll whateyer, and
upon this surface a curve meeting each generating line in four points (e. g. the intersec-
