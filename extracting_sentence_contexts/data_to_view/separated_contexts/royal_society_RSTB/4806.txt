The origin of the duct of the segmental excretory organs of Crustacea is of critical
importance in the consideration of the relationships of these organs to each other and to
the similar organs in other Arthropoda. Up till now, it has been by no means certain
what that origin is, or even whether the ducts have one common origin throughout the
group. Ina study of the development of Estheria it has been suggested by the author
(1924, p. 422) that the divergences of opinion on this point may be due to the fact that
segmental excretory organs are not completely homologous throughout the group. The end-sacs may be, and probably are, homologous, but not the ducts. Burtan and Murn (1921, p. 642) place these glands in two groups according to the
constitution of their efferent ducts.
