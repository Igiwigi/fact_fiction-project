540 THE REV. G. SALMON ON CURVES OF THE THIRD ORDER.

Az(AC—Q!)—QX, Ay(AC—Q")—Qy, Az(AC—Q?)—Qz#.

The condition, then, that these coordinates should be the original &, y, z, is Q=0,
But, Q denotes the nine lines joining the points of contact of tangents drawn from the \
point of inflexion. This, then, coincides with M. PLifcxtr's determination, already ſ
referred to, of the points of contact of osculating conics.

Osculating Cubics.

If through eight consecutive points of a cubic several cubics be drawn, these all meet
the curve again in a fixed ninth point, which can easily be determined. In fact, if we
consider the nine points of intersection of two cubics, the opposite (see page 537) of any
four lies on the same conic with the remaining five. For let the equation of one be
AU=BV and of the other CU=DV, where A, B, C, D represent right lines and U, V
conics; then the intersections of UV are points common to both cubics, and AB, CD -
the opposite points in each cubic. But by combining the equations, we get for the |
equation of the conic through the remaining five points of intersection AD =BC, which
passes through the two opposite points. Q. E. D. |

The theorem may be otherwise stated in what is easily seen to be an equivalent form: :
the opposites of any two sets of four out of the nine points of intersection lie in a right
line with the ninth.
