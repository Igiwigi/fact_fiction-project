In a 2004 analysis of almost 2 million observations of 541 radio sources made at
87 VLBI sites, the predicted deflections were found to agree with the Einstein prediction at the
level (1 + y)/2 =0.99992 + 0.00023. The accuracy of the best VLBI experiments is now better than
100 microarcsec. In addition to these tests, radio astronomy contributed a fourth testâ€”the delay of a radio signal
from a transponder on a space vehicle or planet due to the fact that the radio signal passes through
the gravitational potential well of the Sun. This Shapiro effect [25] depends in the same way as the
deflection tests upon the parameter (1 + y)/2. The deviation of (1 + y)/2 from unity must be less
than 0.0012% (figure 3).
