'= It is now well known, as previously mentioned, that the existing method is usually
E accurate to the -g455 part of the portion of metal operated upon, the process possessing
© in addition to its accuracy many incidental advantages, not the least of which is the
S Po=ibility which it affords of detecting, at different stages of the work, the presence of
&* metallic impurities, such as iridium,
8 On the other hand, it should be observed that the method now in use comprises six
FI distinct operations, and two hours are occupied in ascertaining the final result of the
= as8y; and as it is frequently important to determine the value of an ingot of gold with
g rapidity, it will be obvious that the new method possesses marked advantages in this
& respect, for by its aid a result may be obtained in a few minutes.
© In conelusion, we would submit that experience alone can show whether this new
S process may be made as trustworthy as the existing method ; and we would draw atten-
tion to the fact that hitherto there has not been absolute identity in the conditions
under which the several experiments were made; for instance, the intensity of the
current employed to yolatilize the metal varied from time to time; and this, together
with other defects, mainly arose from the fact that we have as yet considered the pro-
blem solely from its scientific aspect, and haye not provided ourselves with instruments
well adapted for satisfying all the conditions which may arise in practice.

Whether this new method be found preferable to the old one or not, the fact has
been clearly established that it is Possible to detect, by its means, differences in the com-

PoSition of the gold-copper alloy as minute as the 10555 part of the whole mass.
