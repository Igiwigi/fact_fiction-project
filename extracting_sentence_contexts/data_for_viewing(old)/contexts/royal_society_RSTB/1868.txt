of the septate anthers of Angiosperms shows, in any case, that the similar details of
structure in Danew axe consistent with a theory of progressive septation of the
sorus ; this again is in accord with the results of comparison with other Marattiacez,
on which ground it seems probable that the sorus of Danaa has been subject to
elongation.

Partial septa are also found in Kaulfussia and Marattia, though less commonly.
These are genera with slightly elongated sori, and if they have been derived from a
type with a circular form of sorus, such as that of Asterotheca, the partial septations
might be regarded as related to the elongation of the sorus, just as in Danwa, though
in a less prominent degree.

The facts and arguments contained in the above pages are not put forward as
leading to any definite demonstration as to the mode of origin of the Marattiaceous
sorus, or us to the relations by descent of any of its various types. The contention
which I do press, however, with some persistence, is that these questions are still
open, notwithstanding that writers of authority have treated them as already
decided, whether by evidence from fossils, or from development of living forms. I
have above pointed out how in my opinion the paleophytological evidence is insufli-
cient to prove the priority in the Marattiaceze either of the type with separate
sporangia, or of the synangial type. As far as I can see, the facts from fossils would be
consistent with either view. Nor does the argument from comparison and develop-
ment of living forms lead to any definite conclusion, so long as we treat the
Marattiaceze on their own merits, and do not proceed on the assumption that they
were descended from Leptosporangiate ferns. Comparing them, inter se, it would be
