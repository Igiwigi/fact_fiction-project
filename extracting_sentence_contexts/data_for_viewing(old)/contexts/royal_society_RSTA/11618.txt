The last four columns in the table go to show that even at high temperatures -
where, from its mode of derivation the formula should be least satisfactory, it gives
values agreeing closely with those observed. Under ¢ is given a temperature near
the boiling-point of the liquid ; under (cale.) and (obs.), the caleulated and observed
values, respectively, of the viscosity-coeflicients at t, and the difference between the
values is given in the last column. It is clear that in all cases a formula of the above
type will closely reproduce the observed values of 7, and, consequently, 8 and y may
be regarded as the temperature-coefficients of the different substances. It will be
seen from the table that the magnitudes of 8 and y are closely related to chemical
composition, From the fact that the value of » for methyl formate happens to be
less than unity, the value of y for this ester is negative, and hence its coefficients
cannot be satisfactorily compared with those of the other substances, as they are all
positive. Excluding methyl formate, the table shows that in general-—

(1.) In any homologous series 8 and y increase as the molecular weight increases.

(2.) Of isomeric compounds the iso-compound has the smallest coefticients.

(3.) Ethyl ether, the symmetrical isomer, has smaller coefficients than methyl]
propyl ether.
