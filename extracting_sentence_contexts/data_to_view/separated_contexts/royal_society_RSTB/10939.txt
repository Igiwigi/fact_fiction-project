The relationship, if any, of the nidopallium caudolaterale with
the mammalian brain is, however, uncertain. The dominant
view is that it would be equivalent, though not homologous,
to the mammalian prefrontal cortex. This view is weakened
by the fact that nidopallium differs from the mammalian pre-
frontal cortex in that it seems to lack connections with the
hippocampal formation. Whether different animals use similar (homologous or
analogous) mechanisms for computing quantities is dis-
cussed in Vallortigara [19], with regard to both geometry
and the mental number line. Overall, one can make a
strong case for homology in encoding geometry in the hippo-
campal formation of vertebrates, from fish to mammals.
