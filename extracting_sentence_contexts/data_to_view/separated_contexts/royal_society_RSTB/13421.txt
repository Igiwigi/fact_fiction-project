For instance, the observer may be selective
about what and from whom to learn [16,17,63]. Such biases
or social learning strategies [64,65] may be inborn [16,17] or
stem from previously acquired cultural traits [22,66].

transmission, has several consequences for the dynamics of
cultural evolution, including, for instance, the fact that pre-
viously acquired traits can facilitate or even preclude the
subsequent acquisition of other traits, and that an individual
may transmit different trait variants during different stages of
its life. The fact that culture is acquired sequentially does not
exclude the importance of inborn predispositions or abilities
in the acquisition of culture.

Sorting processes are processes that lead to a non-random
change in the frequency of traits. In biological evolution,
