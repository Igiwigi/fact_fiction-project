The analytical study of static and travelling breathers in systems (1.2) and (1.3) is quite delicate. Owing to the lack of smoothness (for p= 5/2) and strongly nonlinear character of the Hertzian
interaction potential, classical approaches based on spatial centre manifold reduction [39] or NLS
reduction [17,18] do not apply. In addition, it has been proved it [38] that exact time-periodic
breathers do not exist in system (1.2) (i.e. without precompression of the chain), despite the fact
that similar excitations can persist over long (but finite) times. An interesting insight into the dynamics of systems (1.2) and (1.3) can be obtained through
the analysis of a spatially discrete modulation equation, namely the discrete p-Schrédinger (DpS)
equation introduced in [32]. This model reads

id
gpa = (Apa)n, neZ, (1.4)

where a(t) = (an(t))nez denotes a time-dependent complex sequence and

(Apa)n = Qn41 — 4n)lQn4za — anlP? = (Qn = an—1)@n = Ona?


the discrete p-Laplacian with p>2.
