Now, as I have before remarked, nerves 80 near
their distribution as these do not usually possess an axis-cylinder as a structure distinct
from the white substance. The white substance does not abruptly cease, while the axis-
cylinder is alone prolonged onwards by itself as is often described, but the entire fibre
divides and subdivides. In fact dark-bordered nerve-fibres, near their ultimate ramifica-
tions, always consist of fatty albuminous material imbedded in a transparent matrix of
connective tissue. The © tubular membrane,” © white substance,” and * axis-cylinder ”
can never be demonstrated as distinct structures near the peripheral distribution of
nerves. The © tubular membrane” is nothing more than the transparent matrix in
which one or more nerve-fibres are imbedded.
