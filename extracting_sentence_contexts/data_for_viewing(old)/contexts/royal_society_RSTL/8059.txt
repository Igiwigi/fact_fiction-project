DR. A. GUNTHER'S DESCRIPTION OF CERATODUS, 559

been able to find any trace of it preserved in the fossil remains, as it is entirely destroyed
like the remainder of the cartilaginous portions. In the fringed fins of the second type,
termed © obtuse ” or © subacutely lobate,” the scaly covering is limited to the base; the
fin-rays are yery distinct, comparatively few in number, and joined to a simple transverse
series of cartilaginous rods. Such are the fins of Polypterus, of the Colacanths as
restricted by HuxLey, and probably also of the Saurodipterini, Having drawn attention
to this, as I believe, important diversity in the only character on which the suborder
Crossopteryqii is founded, I leave the bearing of this fact upon the further classification
of these fossils to be deyeloped by those who are more intimately acquainted with the
details of their structure than myself.

Ishould be found wanting in respect towards the founder of Palzeichthyology, were I to
pass over in silence the opinion expressed by him with regard to the affinities of Ceratodus.
In a letter addressed to Sir Puue E6cerrox (* Nature,” iii. No. 61, p. 166), Professor
A6ass1z states that this fish is clearly a member of the family named by him Colacan-
thini, T am not aware how far AGass1z has modified the characters and limits of this
family since the publication of the * Recherches * (vol. 11. p. 168) and * Vieux Gres
Rouge * (p. 64); at that time he pointed out as the principal characters the hollow con-
dition of the fin-rays and bones (as in birds), the presence of interspinous bones in the
caudal fin, the continuation of the vertebral column between the two lobes of that fin,
