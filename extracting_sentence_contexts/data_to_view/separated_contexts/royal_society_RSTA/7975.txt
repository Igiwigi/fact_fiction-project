and if, as we shall assume henceforth, the medium is incompressible, we have the relation

Assuming now that the medium is homogeneous and isotropic, and denoting the
covariant stress tensor by T;,, we have the stress-strain relations

that there are no body-forces (we neglect gravity): the equations of equilibrium are

which, on making use of (6) and the fact that A,A, = A,A, (since the space is Huclidean),

It follows immediately that p satisfies the harmonic equation

The fundamental equations (6), (9), and the deductions (10), (11), are familiar in
the theory of slow steady motions of viscous liquids.
