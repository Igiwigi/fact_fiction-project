the ponderomotive energy of a free electron (of mass m) in a laser field in vacuum (eo is the

the strong-field approximation, which has been broadly applied and expanded-upon [78]. The
HHG process is essentially a coherent version of the Roentgen X-ray tube, generating high-energy
photons as a result of a high-energy electron-atom collision, and relying on the fact that during the
ionization process, the electron-ion ensemble remains an isolated, coherent quantum system. The
strong electric field of a laser ionizes an electron, pulls it away from its parent ion and then slams

it back. The ionizing electron wavefunction reacts deterministically to the applied field, so that :3
