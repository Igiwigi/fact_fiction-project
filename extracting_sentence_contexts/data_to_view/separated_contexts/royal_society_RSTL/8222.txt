Supposing the whole globe cut by a plane passing through the equator, he investigates
the pressure by which gravitation will urge the annular surfaces of the two opposed
hemispheres against each other, and arrives at the conclusion that it would be equal
to the pressure of a tower (torre) or hollow cylinder of material equal in density to
the crust and standing upon the annular surface of 30 miles' width, of 1716 Italian
geographical miles in height—that is to say, in height equal to about half the radius of
the earth. Whence he shows that no known material could sustain such a strain ; that were the
erust of cast iron it could only support +45 of the crushing force to which the gravita-
tion of the whole system expoxcs it, if of porphyry 445, if of wrought iron g4g, if of
granite 7977, and if of (marmor) primary limestone 5255 of the whole. He concludes, therefore, that the solid shell does not support itself as an equilibrated
dome, but that, in fact, it is almost wholly supported by the fluid nucleus upon which
it floats; and he then attempts to show that the rising of lava in volcanic vents is a
consequence of the partial or unequal sinking of the discontinuous fragments of the
shell into the liquid of the nucleus. It is to be regretted that Ber, after having made
80 good a commencement, should have been misled by his supposition of a yery thin
crust, and a liquid nucleus into an entirely wrong track, and 80 come to adopt a view of
the mechanism of yolcanic action often proposed before him, and which the writer
believes to be untenable. It may be desirable to show, however, that by LAGRANGE'S
method we can treat the question of the crushing of the crust from the same point of
view as BELLL has done, and arrive at substantially a like result.
