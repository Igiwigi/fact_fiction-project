posit. This is 80 remarkable, that in the first small sheet of copper which I stripped
from a platinum electrode, and which is now in my possession, I noticed that the
Scratches of the file, which the latter bore, were perfectly moulded upon it. This is
unlike what one would have expected, & priori, from the precipitation of a metal, by a

gas adhering to the surface of the electrode, and is much more consistent with, what
we now know to be the fact, the immediate deposit of the metallic cathion upon the
platinode without the intervention of the gas. I had also remarked, at times, without
being able to account for it, that the texture of the copper was spongy and little co-
herent.

The beautiful application of this observation by Professor Jacost and Mr. Sygxcer
to the formation of fac-similes of medals and other volta-types, as I have proposed to
call them, has made us better acquainted with the minutest details of this kind of
precipitation ; and eyery one who has attended much to the process, must, have ob-
served that, in conducting it in the usnal way, after the same solution has been a
long time in use, the deposit of compact copper became mixed with copper in a loose,
pulyerulent state, which can be brushed off the mould with the fingers, and greatly
interfered with the beauty of the result. This arises from the accumulation of acid
