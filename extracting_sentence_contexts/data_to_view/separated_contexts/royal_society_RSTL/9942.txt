The extra-branchials of some of these latter types, and of the Sharks, have some
ht and title to be classified as a sort of cephalic ribs, but perhaps that claim had
tter nob be pressed for the present ; ib is safer for the Morphologist' to keep

Ertain things in solution, when any doubt remains, than to crystallize them into what

Hay turn oub to be obstructive error. &Tn the metamorphosis of the larval Sturgeon the additional parts are eaxsily

Splained, and are, for the most part, due to mere increase of certain tracts of tissue, and

Qiper-additions of secondary nuclei of cartilage, and of various centres of ossification. Moreover, the fact that the dermal scutes are largely dominated by the cartilaginous

Hidoskeletal structures of the cranium and pharynx, however interesting from one
point of view, is not of any great fundamental importance. 2 With regard to the great *shoots” of cartilage that grow out, forwards, from the
imary basis-cranii, these are parts that undergo a most extraordinary amount of

Kodification in various types; they are specialised superadditions to the essential
ull, of great importance in Taxonomy, but of little account in that which is funda-

FSental in Morphology.
