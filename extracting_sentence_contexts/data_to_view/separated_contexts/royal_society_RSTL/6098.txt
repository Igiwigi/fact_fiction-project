The crystals are optically positive: the medium-line coincides with the axis of sym-
metry [0 10], and the angle of the optical axes is considerable; in a plate parallel to
010, the beginning of the rings may be seen, their centres being invisible. The centres
may be seen, however, with the aid of a glass prism ; and from this observation, together
with the fact that the indices of refraction are not very far from 1:75, it may be inferred
that the interior angle of the optical axes is not very different from 70%. The plane of
the optical axes is nearly parallel to the face 001; it deviates only by a few degrees,
exhibiting a tendency to approach the plane perpendicular to 10 0, The axis of symme-
try, or of smallest elasticity, exhibits a violet-red colour, which even in very thin layers is
very intense. The axis nearly parallel to [1 0 0], or the axis of greatest elasticity, exhi-
bits a similar but much lighter red tint; the axis of mean elasticity shows in thin layers
a straw-yellow, in thicker layers an orange-yellow.
