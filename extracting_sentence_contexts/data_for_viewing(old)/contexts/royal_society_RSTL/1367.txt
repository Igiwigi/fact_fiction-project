which arrived before Mr. HUnTER's death, were such as shewed
the uterus in its unimpregnated state; and Mr. HuNTER's time
was 80 much occupied by his public appointments that he had
not sufficient leisure to examine them.

In the course of the last summer, I have received from Mr.
Laxs, by the hands of Mr. CoxnsIDAN, and Major NEPEAN,
several preparations of the uterus in different states, and the
young kanguroo at a very early period after leaving the uterus.
'These, on examination, appear to compose a body of evidence
that elucidates several parts of the curious mode of generation
of this animal, and to contain the most material anatomical
facts that are necessary to direct our future inquiries.

The preparations themselves I have deposited in the collec-
tion for which they were originally intended; and am desirous
to communicate the facts and observations to this learned So-
ciety, that they may prove useful to those gentlemen whose
residence in that country enables them to prosecute, and com-
plete, this interesting investigation. |

The only general circumstances I have been able to collect
