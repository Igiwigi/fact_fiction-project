In Z'richomanes reniforme the lamina is more robust
than in other species of the genus, it consists of four to six layers of cells. This more massive assimilating
system is seen in the very species which has the largest output of spores per sporangium in the genus. This appears to me to be a very significant fact, and a definite support of the view that there is a close
casual relation between the filmy character and a lower spore-output in’ certain Osmundacew and in the
Hymenophyllacew.
