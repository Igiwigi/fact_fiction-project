An approximate average from a very large number of measurements
may be given as 23 in length by 13p in breadth, and the longesb diameter of their
nucleus as 9p. On reference to the table of measurements we shall find that, whilst
the upper series of cells in this layer in Man and the Carnivora do not reach this
magnitude, the lower series in Man are far larger, whilst in the Cat the lower series
correspouds exactly in 8ize with those of the Pig. It is important to bear in mind the
fact that the lowest stratumr of the third layer in the Cat is formed of cells identical
