a If we suppose C,,», C,,,,... all zero, the first 7/2 of these equations will serve to
a determine C,, C,,... C, in terms of ys, while the remaining equations will be
satisfied identically. Thus the forced tides for the law of depth in question will be
expressible by a finite series of terms terminating with a term involving P,.

This general law does not hold when 7 = 2, owing to the presence of a term in the
right-hand member of the second equation.

The fact that for these laws of depth the tide-heights could be expressed by finite
series, instead of by the infinite series usually required, was originally proved by
Laptace in the ‘ Mécanique Céleste.’*

Returning to the case of uniform depth, we see that the equations (23) divide
themselves into two groups, in one of which only even suffixes and in the other of
