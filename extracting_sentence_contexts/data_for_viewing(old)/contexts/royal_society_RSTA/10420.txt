DISCHARGE OF ELECTRICITY FROM HOT PLATINUM. 275

are led to the conclusion that it is only those corpuscles which are in some way
associated with hydrogen molecules or atoms which are able to escape from the
platinum, at the temperatures at which it is possible to make observations.
_. Ina note to his paper on “The Electrical Conductivity Imparted to a Vacuum by
_ Hot Conductors” (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ A, vol. 201, pp. 497-549) Mr. Rictarpson suggests
that the effect of hydrogen on the negative leak which I have observed can be
explained on his theory by supposing that the hydrogen diminishes Q while A
remains constant. But, as we have just seen, the fact that the leak is proportional to
p shows that Q is constant and A proportional to p. When p is greater than about
02 millim. it is found that Q does diminish as p increases, but A does not remain
“tonstant.
2 Mr. RicHarpson also suggests that my process of cleaning the platinum with nitric
acid may deposit a layer of negatively charged oxygen on it which would increase Q
vand so diminish the leak. The leak can, however, be reduced without treating the
“wire with nitric acid. If the wire is simply heated in a good vacuum the leak falls
ff with time; and if the gases evolved by the wire are removed, the leak can be
Bteduced in this way to as small a value as can be obtained by treating the wire with
Shitric acid. The nitric acid process was adopted because it enabled the hydrogen to
“Se got rid of without long continued heating which causes the wire to disintegrate.
