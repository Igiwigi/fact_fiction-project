It is noteworthy that the mean salinity at the Stranraer-Larne Station is higher
than that at any point of the North Channel shown in figure 2. This must also be an
effect of mixing, as past this Station the mean current must flow away from the
trish Sea, i.e. in the direction of increasing salinity. In this instance the water from
the Irish Sea is mixed with the salter water from the Atlantic to the north of Ireland.
The fact that the salinity at Stranraer-Larne is under other influence than that coming
from the Irish Sea is shown by the correlation coefficients of table 4. There is only
small correlation with Chicken Rock and Holyhead-Dublin, and no significant correla-
tion with Fishguard-Rosslare.

At the four stations between the Mull of Galloway and Skulmartin L.V. the mean
salinities increase steadily towards the west, though the differences are small and the
Skulmartin series is very short. This fact, coupled with the higher salinity at Stranraer-
Larne, may indicate a south-going current of relatively salt water near the shore off

the north-east coast of Ireland. Such a current would be in harmony with the
suggestions of Nielsen and the Conseil international as mentioned in § 3, and also with
the results of a year’s observations of currents at the Skulmartin L.V. (Proudman
1939) which gave a mean current towards the south-east.

If we assume that the maximum correlation coefficients between the anomalies of
salinity at a pair of stations indicates that the same water has passed from one station
