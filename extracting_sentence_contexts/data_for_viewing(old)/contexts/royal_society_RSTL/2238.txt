needle, Captain W1LsoN proposed to repeat these experi-
ments at different places, where he might have an oppor-
tunity, on his outward and homeward voyages : viz, at St.


Mr. BarLow on the secondary deflections produced, &c, 277

Helena, Bengal, and in China; and he had the satisfaction
of finding the sphere nearly inverted in his different expe-
riments, the law in all cases strictly following those which
had been predicted from my first series of results.

The confirmation however of this fact is now of but se-
condary interest, because it has been demonstrated, and
admitted by all who have taken any part in the enquiry ; I
shall therefore pass over these experiments, and mention
only the curious observations alluded to in the title of this
Paper.

The apparatus which Captain WiLsoN employed was
exactly similar to that which I made use of in Woolwich, viz.
a large and strong round table with a hole in the centre, and
a 13-inch mortar shell, with a contrivance for raising and
lowering the latter through the centre hole.
