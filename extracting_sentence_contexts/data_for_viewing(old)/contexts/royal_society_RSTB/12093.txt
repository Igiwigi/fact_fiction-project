incidence data. We do so in the context of the Ebola viral
disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa in 2014-2015
[13,21,22,32-34]. Specifically, we compare the fit of a dis-
crete-time SEIVD model with time-varying transmission
parameter A(t) [3] to weekly incidence data among the
(i) combined Freetown and Waterloo (F&W) districts in
Sierra Leone, (ii) the Port Loko (PL) district in Sierra Leone
and (iii) Sierra Leone (SL) as a whole. In some cases,

we allow the initial number of exposed individuals E(0) to
be a fitted parameter, as a way of dealing with the fact that
we do not know when the first infection actually occurred
within a particular district. Further, we allow for the fact
that the actual size of the susceptible group underlying a
particular set of incidence data is not known by fitting an
effective-population size Neg, a term borrowed from genetics,
but used here in a different context. Specifically, Ng answers
the question: what would the best estimate of the size of
the underlying population be if the epidemic were taking
place in a homogeneous population (i.e. homogeneous
individual hosts from, inter alia, a spatial, behavioural, phys-
iological and immunological point of view; as well as a single
homogeneous strain of pathogen)?
