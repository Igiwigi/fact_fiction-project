whitish colour,
combined by a membrane and moyed by many museles.” It is clear, however, from this passage, that TzoscaeL
has not recognized the true mechanism of the organ,

+ There is a curious similarity between the © tongue” of the Mollusca and the arrangement of the dental
apparatus in the Plagiostome fishes, which may be viewed perhaps as another illustration of Von Bazx's law,
that while the exterior of a yertebrate animal is Articulate in its construction, the interior is Molluscous. { Since writing the above, I find that so far back as 1829, the existence of this organ was distinetly pointed
out, though strangely enough the fact has been quite overlooked by every one saye Vox StzroLD; he, however,
merely refers to the statement in a note, and says he *does not know what to make of it.” (Vergleichende Ana-
tomie, p. 312.) This statement is contained in a valuable paper upon the anatomy of the Mollusca, entitled
« General Observations on Univalves,” by Mr. Cuantes Collier, Staff-Surgeon at Ceylon; printed in the
Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal for 1829, p. 231.
