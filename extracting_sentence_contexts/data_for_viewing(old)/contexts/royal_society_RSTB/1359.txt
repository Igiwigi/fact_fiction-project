The Degenerations Resulting from Removal of the Motor Area in the Cat. |

The material furnished by four cats which had recovered well after the above-
named operation furnished the basis of this investigation.

Description of Operation.—With the same precautions as in the preceding ex
periments, the anterior portion of the brain was removed with bistoury and scoop, so
as to ensure the complete removal of the motor zone.

Anatomical Changes.—Reserving the paths of degeneration in the brain for a_
subsequent chapter, a section through the mesencephalon at the level of the posterior —
corpora quadrigemina, showed striking degeneration and slight atrophy of the crusta,
in fact, the same as in the case of the removal of the hemisphere. There were, apart
from the crusta and a few fibres in the roof of the aqueduct, no other signs of
degeneration. The IIIrd nerves, the descending root of the Vth, the anterior and
lateral columnar fibres, and the posterior longitudinal bundles were absolutely intact.

Fig. 2, Plate 3, represents a section through the medulla, and the only degenerate
fibres present were those in the pyramid ; the comparison with the hemisphere cats is
striking, fig. 1, Plate 3,

In the cervical cord there are no degenerate fibres in the anterior columns. In the
lateral column the round bundle formed by the small degenerate fibres of the crossed
pyramidal tract, fig. 6, Plate 3, are well seen, but there are no scattered large
fibres belonging to the lateral columnar system.
