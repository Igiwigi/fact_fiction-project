5. Conclusion

We have constructed a knock-down RNAi line of OsNRPD1,
encoding the largest subunit of POLYMERASE IV, a central
component of RdDM in rice. This line displayed reduced
24-nt siRNAs and DNA methylation compared to WT. We

also detected new insertions of three retrotransposons. How-
ever, we could not clearly distinguish between the impact of
in vitro culture and the knock-down of OsNRPD1, even if we
have some indications of the effect of the latter. This may be
explained by the fact that we only obtained a weakly affected
line. We propose reasons that support the hypothesis of the
sterility of a null mutant of OsNRPD1.

Data accessibility. Seeds of osnrpd1 lines are available from the corre-
