Arabia, therefore, with Sinai, during the Lower and Middle Jurassic formed part
of a region where the periods of ammonite colonization seem to have alternated with
those in other regions. The normal invaders of most parts of the world were excluded;
ammonites that are among the least conspicuous elsewhere entered and flourished, pro-
ducing extraordinary aberrant forms. This curious fact suggests that Arabia formed part
of a region which had a tectonic history opposite or complementary to that normal for
the better-known sedimentary basins of the world in the Jurassic. Transgressions round
the Arabo-Nubian massif and into the Tuwaiq bay perhaps coincided with regressions in
the old classic regions of Europe and elsewhere. The Middle East was a region also characterized by pseudoceratites in the Cretaceous.
