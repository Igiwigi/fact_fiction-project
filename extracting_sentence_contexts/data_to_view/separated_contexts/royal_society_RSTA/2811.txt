Are there other billiards with infinitely many caustics? Quite surprisingly, the answer is
affirmative: all (sufficiently smooth) Birkhoff billiards have infinitely many smooth convex
caustics that accumulate to the boundary of the billiard domain. In fact, Lazutkin [24] introduced
a very special change of coordinates that reduces the billiard map Bg to a very simple form. Let
Le :R/tZ x [0,7] > R/Z x [0,4] with small 6 > 0 be given by

‘
(y) =Lols,9) = (ca! I, p 7 (r)dz, 4Cg'o'/°(s) sin 7) ,

where p denotes the radius of curvature of 02, and Cg := Sb p2/3(s) ds (sometimes called the
Lazutkin perimeter).
