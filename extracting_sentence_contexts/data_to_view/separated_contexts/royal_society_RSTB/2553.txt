The ultimate appearance of these portions would
naturally vary according to the rapidity or slowness of subsequent changes. And
infiltration of water might entirely remove the residual products und introduce foreign
material ; very often small crystals of salt are present. Not infrequently the hyphe of fungi and alge penetrating the skeleton spread
more especially in these lamellar bands, the mere fact that the growth-lamelle
are there apposed to their neighbours affording an easier ingress for the hyphe. Decalcification proved, however, that the hyphe ramified anywhere and everywhere,
as well as in the lamellar planes. Further, decalcification brought out very clearly
the identity of the median dark bands or points with those of the fibrous lamedle.
