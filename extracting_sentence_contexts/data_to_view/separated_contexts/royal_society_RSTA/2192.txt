The topic axial ratios of the rubidium salt are also intermediate between those for
the potassium and cesium salts, there being a regular progressive increase in the
directional (axial-edge) dimensions of the structural unit cell of the space-lattice,
when potassium is replaced by rubidium and the latter in turn by cesium. The topic
axial ratios of ammonium nickel selenate are almost identical with those of rubidium
nickel selenate, the structural (space-lattice) unit cells of the rubidium and ammonium
salts being thus almost identically congruent, that is similar in shape and symmetry
and almost exactly equal in total volume and in the dimensions of their sides and
edges, This result, similar to the results with all the other groups of double selenates
yet investigated and of all the double sulphates and the simple alkali sulphates,
thus forms yet another confirmation of one of the most remarkable facts brought to
light by the author’s investigations, namely, the extraordinary congruency of the
ammonium and rubidium salts of any group; the replacement of two atoms of
monad rubidium by eight atoms of monad hydrogen and two atoms of triad (at
least, more probably pentad) nitrogen, actually occurs without any appreciable
opening up of the structure. The bearing of this important fact on the theory of
valency volumes of Bartow and Porr, with which it is in entire antagonism, is
discussed in a separate communication (sea Roy. Soc. Proc.).
