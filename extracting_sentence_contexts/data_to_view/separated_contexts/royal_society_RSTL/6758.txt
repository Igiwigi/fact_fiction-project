THE CHEMICAL CONSTITUTION OF NARCOTINE. 365
u8ually considered characteristic of the aldehydes. In any case, however, the fact that
nascent hydrogen converts opianic acid into meconin, but has no action on hemipinic
acid, excludes the possibility of regarding the first of these bodies as a hemipinate of
meconin. 5. The action of hydrochloric and hydriodic acids on opianic acid and its congeners
proves that methyl is a constituent of each of them ; and since one molecule of hemi-
pinic acid yields two molecules of iodide of methyl when distilled with hydriodic acid,
we must assume the existence of two atoms of methyl in each molecule of meconin,
opianic acid, or hemipinic acid.
