Part of this will also be
attracted, but not so far from its course, nor will an equal
number be affected at all; so that the mark made on the white
body will be nearer the direction of the stream, and of less size
than that made by the pure iron. It matters not whether all
this would actually happen, even allowing we could place the
Subjects in the situation described; the thing may easily be con-
ceived, and affords a good enough illustration of what happens
in the case of light.

_  Pursuant to the plan I before followed, I now tried to mea-
sure the different degrees of reflexity, 8&c. of the different rays;
but though the measurements which I took agreed in this, that
the red images were much larger than the rest, and the green
appeared by them of a middle size, yet they did not agree well
enough (from the roughness of the images, and several other
causes of error), to authorize us to conclude with any certainty

bably be afterwards found to be the case; in the mean time
there is little doubt that the sizes are the cause of the fact. II. Several phenomena are easily explicable on the principles
Jjust now laid down.
