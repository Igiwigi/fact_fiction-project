pare with the nucleus of a yelk-globule from an immature oyum of the Tiger in my
Second Series on the Embryo).

61. The two cells in question, in the ovum, at a certain period are set free; each
being destined to give origin to others. Such also is the case with the corpuscles of
the blood. See figs. 29, 30, 39, 41 y.

62. The foregoing analogies are not confined to yertebrated animals; for I have
met with some of them, at least, in three classes of the Invertebrata. See figs. 57,
61 and 62.

63. Such facts as these appear to warrant the conelusion, that the corpuscles of
the blood are generated by a process essentially the same as that described in one of
my former memoirs, as giving origin to those cells which are the immediate 8uc-
cessors of the germinal vesicle, or original parent cell.

64. If the blood-corpuscles of Man in fig. 23 be minutely examined in the order in
which they are alphabetically lettered, and in connection with the description sepa-
rately given (par. 87),—and if they be then compared with a succession of appear-
ances delineated in my former paper on the Corpuscles of the Blood},—1I think it will
be obvious that those appearances arose from the blood-corpuscle resolving itself into
minuter objects, by a continuation of the same process as that through which, as we
have just seen, it is itself produced.
