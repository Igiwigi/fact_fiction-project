5. The mammoth steppe

To understand how the tundra would be influenced by a
diverse herbivore assembly, we have to look back to the Late
Pleistocene and its diverse herbivore assembly. One of the
most controversial hypotheses about the influence of large her-
bivores on arctic tundra vegetation is that human extinction of
megaherbivores, rather than climate, drove the disappearance
of the so-called mammoth steppe vegetation [7]. The impor-
tance of understanding this process today is accentuated by
the fact that it also suggests that soil carbon storage decreased
by more than 1000 Gt during this vegetation shift [67], and that
the expected massive loss of soil carbon in the face of a warm-
ing Arctic could be inhibited by restoring megaherbivores
that would reduce permafrost thawing [68]. During the Late

Pleistocene, the mammoth steppe was probably the Earthâ€™s
most extensive biome [69], and a diverse set of megaherbivores
existing at high densities grazed these extensive graminoid-
forb plains, much like the African savannah today. The den-
sities of large herbivores inhabiting the mammoth steppe in
Alaska and northeastern Siberia have been estimated to have
been as high as 105kg ha" [68], which is more than an
