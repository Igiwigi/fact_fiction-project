(d) Demographics of mixed-SES U.S. children
Buchsbaum et al. [14] sampled children primarily from U.S. middle
and upper middle class backgrounds that reside in the
San Francisco Bay Area. Children were tested in university-affiliated
preschools, science museums or other private preschools. According
to 2019 Bay Area census data, the median annual income was
$99 406 in Alameda County and $112449in San Francisco
County (https: //www.census.gov /quickfacts /fact/table/alamed

There was some degree of SES variation across the Peruvian
and U.S. samples in addition to cultural variation, with the Per-
uvian children being from a lower SES background than the U.S.
mixed-SES children, although it is difficult to quantify this across
countries, especially when considering families’ ‘relative’

economic standing within their own community. When contrast-
ing the Buchsbaum ef al. U.S. sample with the Head Start
U.S. sample, SES is a key differentiating variable.
