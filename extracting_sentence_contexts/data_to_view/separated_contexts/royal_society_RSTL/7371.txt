We have thus investigated the relation existing between the amount of chemical
change and the amount of hydric peroxide, and have shown that the former of these
quantities varies directly with the latter. We now proceed to inquire how the amount
of change is affected by the variation of the other conditions of the reaction. For a particular system the amount of chemical change in a unit of time is expressed
< by ey, this expression representing the fact that if is kept constant the amount of
S change yaries directly with y, that is, with the amount of peroxide, and also that if y is
= kept constant it varies directly with «. That which has been kept constant in each set
= of experiments made to determine the values of y, and which is represented by «, is a

S group of other conditions upon which the amount of chemical change depends. 'The
L systems which have been made the subjects of experiment in this investigation have all

S been liquid homogeneous systems.
