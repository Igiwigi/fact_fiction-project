in which they are measured. Experiments were therefore performed with the disks shown in
figure 11.

Ficure 11. Various dispositions of manometric tubes for measuring the pressure in different
directions in the rotating beaker apparatus. A is the axis of rotation of the beaker.

It was found that for the same conditions of radial distance of the holes and separation of
disk from beaker the pressures measured in the solutions were independent of the direction
of measurement. The pressures were therefore as envisaged—isotropic pressures.

(2) The theory is based on the hypothesis that the pressure generated is due to the
difference in the shear-energy input at two points and not to the mere fact that there is shear.
Thus ifa surface has uniform shear on it there should be no excess pressure generated at any
point compared with any other. This can be tested in several ways: (a) In a Couette-type
viscometer the inner static cylinder when ¢otally immersed experiences uniform shear at all
points sufficiently removed from the edges. Further, for small separations the shear is almost
uniform in the strained fluid. A hole was therefore drilled in the inner cylinder of such an
apparatus and the pressure tested as in a of figure 12. No pressure was generated.* (b) When
an inner double cone was substituted as in figure 12, thus varying the rate of shear at the
surface, the excess pressure phenomenon was observed. (c) A condition of uniform shear
can also be produced on the conical face of a stator, as in figure 12c, provided that the cone

* There is an apparent paradox here: the liquid inside the manometric chamber is stationary and, on
the present hypothesis, it should act as a sink for the broken fragments of the colloidal structure and show a
