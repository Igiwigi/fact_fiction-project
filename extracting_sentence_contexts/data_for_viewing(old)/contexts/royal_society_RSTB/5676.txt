and exhibiting waves of constriction, finally form a cluster on either side of the body ;
a branchial and a single atrial siphon appear at about the same time, the differentiation
of the alimentary tract and feeding mechanism and protostigmata is the same ; while,
lastly and unexpectedly, a mass of highly refractive cells appears at the side of the
stomach in exactly the same position as that occupied by the refractive cells resulting
from the phagocytosis of the tail in the case of Molgula citrina and other forms.

That is, neither a tail nor larval sense organs are formed, but otherwise the whole
later course of development is identical with that which results from the metamorphosis
of a tadpole.

It should also be noted that the follicle cells of the egg are numerous and highly
vacuolated in spite of the fact that the ovum is relatively large; and that therefore,
since M., retortiformis is oviparous, the shrinkage and stretching out of the follicle cells
in other species is to be correlated with viviparity rather than increase in the size of
the egg. More fully, increase in size of the egg causes the original limited number of
outer follicle cells to become stretched and flattened over the surface of the chorion ;
in the case of viviparous species this was a matter of indifference and so they remained
in this condition, but in a form such as Molgula retortiformis, where development proceeds
in the water outside the parent body, the buoyancy of the egg would be affected and
so the number would need to be increased to counteract the stretching and keep constant
the specific gravity.
