- dition, being, half an hour later, found fully concentrated. Soon after this, however.
-— diffusion again commenced, and continued to advance steadily till circulation ceased
— early the following morning, at which time the integument was almost black. In the
Qeourse of a few hours, however, it was brought again back to the palest possible tint by
post mortem concentration.

S The diffusion which ultimately took place in this case was no doubt due to loss of
function on the part of the central ganglia or the nerves connecting them with the pig-
Zment-cells. But from the occurrence of concentration half an hour after the faculty for
reflex action had ceased, we learn that these nerves, like the intrinsic motor nerves of the
©heart and intestines, remain unaffected by the Urari poison for a considerably longer
.Stime than those which excite the contractions of the voluntary muscles. We further
Slearn from the fact that post mortem concentration came on as usual, that the pigment-
Scells retain their powers, and also their capability of acting in mutual harmony after the
Sthythmical contractions of the heart have been abolished by this poison.

> Such experiments are 80 readily performed, and the effects produced upon the pig-
=Zment-cells or the nerves which govern them are 80 obviously indicated by the changes
of colour in the integument, that I venture to recommend this method of investigation
Eto those who are occupied in studying the action of poisons.
