This is an example of
opting for ‘low hanging fruit’ (easy to obtain training data), which raises some issues, as it
implies that the system draws its conclusions based on the Court’s articulation of the facts
of the case. As the authors note, the Court probably formulates the facts in a way that is
conducive to fit the conclusion ([25]: 5/19). This entails that no conclusions can be drawn about
correlations between the facts of the case and the outcome, and although the authors seem to
be aware of this, they nevertheless do conclude that the facts of the case have high predictive
value. If the cases that were deemed inadmissible or struck out beforehand had been taken
into account, this may have made a difference to the assessment. This potential difference now
remains invisible.
