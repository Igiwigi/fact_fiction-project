of the disturbances at Toronto and Hobarton, stations almost as far from each other,
geographically, as it is possible for two: places to be situated on the surface of the
earth, but possessing considerable analogy in their magnetical relations. 'The result
of the comparison was to show a striking connection between the two places in the
laws of the occurrence of disturbances, whether as regards the hour of the day, the
season of the year, or the year itself. Now St. Helena and the Cape of Good Hope,
Situated near together, are unlike magnetically, as well as in geographical position,
to either Toronto or Hobarton ; and I am desirons, in addition to presenting an
investigation into the periodical character of the laws of disturbance operating at
the new stations, to point out in what respect the character agrees, and in what it
differs, from that which has been found at Toronto and Hobarton.

We may expect, from facts already known, some agreement in the amount of
disturbance in the same years at different places. Table I. exhibits the ratios of the
numbers and aggregate values of the disturbed observations in the different years to
the average annual number and aggregate value, alsÂ» the average value of one
disturbance in each year.
