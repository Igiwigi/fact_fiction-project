for instance, no. 4, figure 3, a bud did arise in the axil of a P, with its centre removed,
may be explained by its having been already determined.

Finally, the problem of leaf asymmetry remains to be considered. As stated in the
introduction, Schumann at first considered leaf asymmetry to be the determining factor of
the phyllotaxis, but later abandoned this view. In Hirmer’s opinion (1922) the asymmetry
and the phyllotaxis both result from the insertion of a sector in the apex, but reasons have
been given for considering it improbable that such a process takes place, and in any case

it could not account for the fact that in Rhoeo the kathodic half (called by Hirmer ‘anodic’,
see p. 133) is the longer tangentially, contrary to what Hirmer states to be the general
rule.

Schoute (1913, pp. 297, 310) considered that leaf asymmetry was secondary and occurred
when the space available for a primordium was itself asymmetric provided that the new
primordium made contact with the underlying leaves. The new primordium then extended
asymmetrically to fill the unequal gaps on each side of its centre. This may, indeed, perhaps
account for the fact that in Rhoeo the anodic half is usually slightly the thicker radially,
since it lies above the meeting-point of the edges of the previous leaf, where there is the
most space available in a radial direction; but it cannot account for the greater length of
the kathodic half in normal plants. The following results of the present experiments need
also to be considered. When the centre of P, was removed, the anodic half of J, increased
