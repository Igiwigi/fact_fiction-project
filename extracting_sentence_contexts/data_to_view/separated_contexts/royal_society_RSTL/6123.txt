On looking at their specific gravities, we find that Sn, Au has
almost its calculated one, whereas Sn, Au expands, and Sn Au, contracts more than any
other of the gold-tin alloys experimented with. In their general appearance we see that Sn Au, and Sn, Au are not at all crystalline,
and have a very glassy fracture ; but Sn, An is exceedingly crystalline, and always shows,
on being broken, the cleavage plane of a crystal from one end of the piece to the other. CONDUCTING POWER OF ALLOYS. 173

For the above reasons I think there can be no doubt that the irregularity of the gold-tin
curve is due to chemical combination, and that the same may be said of the gold-lead
curye. 7

That s8ome alloys are mechanical mixtures, we know from facts determined by other
experimenters; thus, when we fuse 17:73 parts of bismuth and 16-12 parts of zinc toge-
ther, we find two layers, the upper one consisting of 13:40 parts of zinc, and the lower
one 19-40 parts of bismuth alloyed with traces of zinc*; now had we stirred the two
metals well together, and cooled rapidly the alloy 80 obtained, it might be considered as
a mechanical mixture. Again, according to Lzvorf, if we fuse silver and copper together, and allow the
alloy to remain quietly in the fused state, we find, on analysing the mass, that different
pavts contain different per-centages of metal: he found this to be the case with all
alloys, excepting that containing 28:11 per cent. of copper, which corresponds to the
formula Ag, Cu,. Levyor, regards all alloys of silver and copper as mixtures of Ag, Cu,, and either
8ilver or copper; if this were the case, we should have expected to find from that
point to pure silver or copper, straight lines; but on examining that curve, starting from
the copper side of it, we first see that a rapid decrement takes place, caused by the
copper being alloyed with a small quantity of silver.
