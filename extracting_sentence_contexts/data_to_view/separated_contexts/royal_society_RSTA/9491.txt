Among the results to which Raytercut was led is the following. If
an inviscid liquid flows between parallel planes, the motion is stable if up| dy®
retains the same sign throughout the liquid, u, being the velocity in the steady motion
and _» the distance from one of the planes. This result is deduced from the fact that
the characteristic values of a parameter in a certain differential equation cannot be
complex, the implication being that they are therefore real. RaAyiercH$ further
claimed that the method established the stability of a uniform shearing motion, for
which d?u,/dy? = 0. Ketvin|| and Love § criticized the method, and a review of the
situation in 1907 was given by Orr.** In spite of the fact that its general validity
remains obscure, the characteristic-value method has been widely employed.{{ It
is not the purpose of the present paper to attempt to justify or to discredit the
characteristic-value method in general.
