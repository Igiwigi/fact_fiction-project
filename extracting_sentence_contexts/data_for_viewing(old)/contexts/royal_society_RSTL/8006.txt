turn a maximum value of the shearing-force in one direction into a minimum value in
the opposite direction. It becomes necessary, therefore, to add to our previous rules for
the sections of maximum and zero shearing-forces. Before doing this it will be conve-
nient to repeat what was said respecting the number of balanced sections in a ship float-
ing in still water. The general laws deduced from various cases are as follows :â€”if there
be, as there generally is, an excess of weight at both the extremities, the curve of loads
will cross the axis in an even number of points, and consequently the number of balanced
8ections is even. Hence it follows that the number of sections of maximum or minimum
shearing must also be even; and it is obvious that between two maximum ordinates of
the curve of shearing, both of which lie upon the same side of the axis, there must occur
either a minimum ordinate also lying upon the same side, or a maximum ordinate lying
upon the other side of the axis. Since these conditions hold, and we know in addition
that the curve of shearing must cross the axis in at least, one point, on account of the fact

- that there is an excess of weight at both ends of the ship, it follows that if it crosses the
axis in any other points, these additional sections of zero shearing must be either two in
number or some multiple of two. In other words, the whole number of sections of zero

* shearing, which we have shown to be also sections of water-borne division, must be

- odd in 8hips having excesses of weight at the bow and stern.
