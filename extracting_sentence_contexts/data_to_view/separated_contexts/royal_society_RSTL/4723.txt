During the whole process not a trace
of permanent gas was disengaged. After a day's ebullition the solution had become
neutral, and deposited on cooling magnificent crystals of iodide of tetrethylammonium,
which were identified by analysis. In fact, for the determinations III. and V., men-
tioned at the analysis of the platinum-compound, the salts had been prepared with
the base obtained in this manner. On submitting the mother-liquor of the crystals
to distillation in such a manner as to collect only the most volatile products, a con-
siderable amount of perfectly pure alcohol was obtained, which was identified by a
careful comparison of all its properties. The action of iodide of ethyl upon oxide
of tetrethylammonium is therefore represented by the following equation—
