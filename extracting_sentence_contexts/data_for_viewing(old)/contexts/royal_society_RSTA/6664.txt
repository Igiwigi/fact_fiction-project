for a given value of m, and an upper limit (4,,,,.) on 6 when m and E are specified. The cross-
section (¢) for the production of recoil tracks of range greater than 1-7, can then be cal-
culated, if the charge numbers (2, z’) of the fission fragment and the recoil nucleus are known;
the Rutherford scattering formula yields the relation

where ¢ = total collision cross-section and P.,,,.= maximum impact parameter corre-

sponding to recoil angle @,,,,. The cross-section calculated from these formulae is in fact
greater than the true cross-section because no allowance has been made for the screening
of the nuclear charges by extranuclear electrons. Nevertheless, it may be used to estimate
an upper limit for the probability of occurrence of nuclear recoil tracks longer than 1-7.

In the case of fission fragments traversing a photographic emulsion, the nuclear recoils
may be divided into three groups, according to the mass of the nucleus struck; these groups
are:

(i) Protons (m = 1).
(ii) Light recoils: carbon (m= 12), nitrogen (m = 14), oxygen (m = 16).
