which is the number of points 6, lying in lined with the origin and another point 6, ;
the number of apparent double points is the half of this, or k=Z{[m—1]P. And thence

M=(—Ym}+b=)—(m—U).
I investigate also the number of lines through two points which meet two arbitrary
lines; this is in fact =S(1, m2?), which for the curve in question is

=(3[mP—(m—1)=)(m—1Y.
Let the equations of the two lines be (x=0, y=0) and (z=0, w=0); then the con-

ditions to be satisfied are \
