The sum of log G, log (g), log (x), and log (s) gives column log (G corr.), the logarithm:

heating-effect) should have been made at all, as from 8ubsequent experiment the deviations in different parts
of the scale were found to be very nearly identical with the same heating-ecffect ; in fact the difference was less
than the probable error of observation.

of readings, as was done to saye labour. :

of G corrected for change of phase, change of distance, and for the variation of the values
of the scale. These corrected values of log G are now available for the determination of the law
of the extinction of the moon's radiant heat in the earth's atmosphere. For this
purpose a graphic method, suggested by that employed by SEIDEL* in his researches
concerning the extinction of stellar light, was made use of, The night's observations were

zenith-distance on any given night each other log (G corr.) of that night was subtracted.
