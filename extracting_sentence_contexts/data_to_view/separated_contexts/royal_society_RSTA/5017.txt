A third range of tempera-
ture is dealt with in Part IIL, but its data are insufficient for plotting upon the
plate; the results for this range, 78° to 100°, would appear to lie still lower. It is to be observed that the curvature almost dies out for the higher ranges of
temperature. In fact, the gas behaves then more nearly as a perfect gas. ‘Thus,
from 35° to 100°, the specific heat is given, closely, by
