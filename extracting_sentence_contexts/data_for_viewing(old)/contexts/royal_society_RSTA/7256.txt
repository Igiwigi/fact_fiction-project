If -=0 and =0, but @,+a,, then must = =0. (97)

This fact makes a most welcome simplification of the theory. For the decision whether G?
is a minimum, or not, depends on the expansion of G? by Taylor’s theorem in the variations,
da;, of the m parameters. When the first derivatives vanish, one expects in general to have to
study the quadratic form in m variables involving the second derivatives; and that may be
bothersome. But here the quadratic form is already reduced to a sum of squares. Moreover,
by (94), each of the squares is positive. It follows that:

Tf 0, dy) «+5 %m, no two of which are equal, make G? stationary, they make it a minimum. (98)

Tt will next be shown that G? cannot be a minimum if any two of the @ are equal. For if
a; is put equal to @, after the differentiations, then the integrands in (93) and (95) become
equal, so that:
