190 MR. A. C. SEWARD ON THE STRUCTURE

referred to by Brown as possessing a closed vascular ring, there is no phloem on the
inner side of the xylem. On the whole, perhaps, Dicksonia rubiginosa approaches
most closely to the structure of Matonia, but our knowledge of the anatomy of
gamostelic ferns is far from satisfactory, and we do not possess the necessary data for
a detailed comparison of Matonia pectinata, as regards the anatomy of the stem and
the mode of origin of the leaf steles, with other genera having a somewhat similar
structure. Work now in progress by Messrs. GwyNNE-VAuGHAN, Boone, and others
should yield results of special value from the point of view of fern anatomy and as
