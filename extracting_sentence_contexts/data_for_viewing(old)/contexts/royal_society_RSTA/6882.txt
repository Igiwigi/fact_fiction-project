Remembering that the elevation ¢ is given by the real part of (10), and considering the
value of F for large negative values of x, it is evident that this solution corresponds to waves
of the form (11a) travelling in the direction Oy and incident normally on the breakwater.

On the leeward side of the breakwater F tends to zero for large positive x, agreeing with
the obvious fact that the screening becomes more and more effective as we move farther
away from the open end. At points directly behind the open end (x = 0), F tends to }e-*#v
for large y, indicating that the amplitude of the waves is there reduced to half that of the
waves in the open sea.

On the windward side of the breakwater, F contains the term e’, corresponding to the
reflected waves moving in the negative y-direction. These combine with the incident waves

to form stationary waves. At points well removed from the open end of the breakwater
(x large and positive), the amplitude of these stationary waves is twice that of the travelling
