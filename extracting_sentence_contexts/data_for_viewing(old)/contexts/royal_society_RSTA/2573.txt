I believe that such a simplistic propagandist picture is infinitely remote from reality. 1 would be
extremely surprised if any practicing mathematician working outside mathematical logic and
foundations, who has given some genuine thought to these matters, would seriously support
any of these views traditional in Philosophy. And yet, it is exactly this grossly distorted picture
of Mathematics that largely determines many practical issues, including its teaching at school,
college and university levels!

And here is what all professional mathematicians know about proofs but are afraid or unwilling
to acknowledge.

e A proof considered as a text proves nothing except the fact that proofs existâ€”and, hopefully
that a proof of the result that is claimed might exist. The texts (of any degree of detail!) as
presented in the available mathematical literature are mere road maps. An actual proof is
not a text at all, but a process consisting of reproducing all arguments and computations.

e A proof is a proof only up to the extent that it reflects a result of understanding and helps
to reproduce and transmit this understanding. A proof is only a proof for a person who
can understand it [1], and even for such persons only while they are able to keep in their
memory both the main ideas and fragments of the general context, of the techniques used
and of enough key details to control the remaining details.

e It was known to the ancient Chinese, some twenty-five centuries ago, that it is easier to
write an incorrect proof than to understand a correct one. The only way to check a proof
