The 2D webs transmit the vibration signal and give information about the existence and
position of prey to the spider within the web. The spider recognizes vibrations produced from
different sources, such as wind, rain, prey or other conditions [14]. In fact, the orb-weaver spider
depends only on the vibrational properties of the web to detect the stimuli within the webs
[15]. The spiderâ€™s sensation of transmitted vibrations clearly allows it to identify orientation and
discrimination towards the detected stimulus source. Barrows [16] reported that the spider orients
itself within the centre of the spider web to seize flies that impact the web.
