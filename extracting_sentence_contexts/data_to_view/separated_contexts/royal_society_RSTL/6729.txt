Almost the only property
which thallium possesses in common with the alkali-metals is the solubility of its oxide,
and perhaps its forming an insoluble platinum-salt. But oxides of lead, silver, and
mercury are also soluble in water, reacting in many respects like alkaline solutions ;
and oxide of thallium is far more analogous to these than to potash and soda, inasmuch
as it has scarcely any affinity for water, becoming anhydrous, in a vacuum, eyen in the
cold. In opposition to these reasons for classing it with the alkalies, we have numerous
facts to prove that its true position is by the side of mercury, lead, or silver. 'The ready
dehydration of its basic oxide—the insolubility of its sulphide, iodide, chloride, bromide,
chromate, phosphate, sulphocyanide, and ferrocyanide—its great atomic weight—its
ready reduction by zine to the metallic state—and, according to Dr. MiLLzR, the com-
plexity of its photographic spectrum—all prove that thallium cannot consistently be
classed anywhere but amongst the heavy metals, mercury, silver, lead, &c.

will attach slight importance to the argument adduced by M.
