The supposed existence of a hydrate of meconin derives some slight support from the
fact that, when the product obtained by heating opianic acid with potash is dissolved
in water and the solution made acid with hydrochloric acid, the meconin remains for a
long time dissolved in the acid liquid unless a great excess of hydrochloric acid is added—
apparently as though it did not exist, as 8uch in the solution, but required a certain
time, or else the aid of a great excess of acid, to enable it to separate from a previous
state of combination *.

4. The conversion of opianic acid into meconin by means of nascent hydrogen is a
transformation as anomalous as that last considered, if viewed as a direct deoxidation of
the acid; but if it be supposed that a compound C,, H;, ©, is first formed and is con-
verted by subsequent dehydration into meconin, the reaction appears (not as a removal
of oxygen, but) as a fixation of hydrogen, and takes its place among a large number of
similar transformations which have been observed within the last few years to occur
