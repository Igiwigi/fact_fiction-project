Stability curves obtained for all collision models of interest (RM, HM, CM, CHM, K and RR) are

compiled in figure 9 for L = 256, M = 50 and considering the two configurations: SRT and REG.
From them, several mathematical results obtained in our previous work [5] can further be

confirmed. First, when only one relaxation time is used (SRT configuration), all moment-based


LBMs recover the same behaviour (BGK) with the exception of the cumulant approach. The
RR-LBM further diverges from the BGK due to the reconstruction of the non-equilibrium part
of populations through recursive formulae. When high-order moments are equilibrated, the
REG-CHM model recovers the behaviour of the SRT-RR approach. The REG-HM and REG-RR
further leads to the standard regularized approach. The latter is explained by the fact that this
configuration (REG) amounts to discarding the non-equilibrium part of populations that are
computed using recursive formulae.

In addition, it is confirmed that none of the collision models are able to remove the Mach
number limitation, which was obtained in the linear case, and which is imposed by the lattice
and the equilibrium. In fact, by adopting a different type of equilibrium, e.g. the entropic
formulation obtained by minimizing the H-functional under the constraint of density and
momentum conservation [134], this limitation could be alleviated but at the cost of part of the
physics [76]. To improve both the physical and numerical properties of LBMs, one could include
correction terms for the velocity-dependent errors that remain in the definition of the viscous

stress tensor [26,47,77,85,92-95]. : =
