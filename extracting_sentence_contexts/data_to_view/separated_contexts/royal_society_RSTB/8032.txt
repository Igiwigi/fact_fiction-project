There is a gradation in style of ribbing from large
forms with simple peristome (Pseudotoites) to small forms with lappets (Oftoites, Trilobiti-
ceras, Normannites ?), and the impression is irresistible that they are all more closely related
to one another than to their European counterparts. Zemistephanus also is certainly a close relative of Pseudotoites and not of Teloceras, which is

radiation, or deployment, give rise to various ‘genera’, more or less parallel to those
produced by other stocks in other parts of the world at the same or a different time. The Bajocian provides some other notable examples.
