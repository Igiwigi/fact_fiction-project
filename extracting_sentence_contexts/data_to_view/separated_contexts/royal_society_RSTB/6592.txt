Immediately posterior to
this terminal bifurcation is a deep vertical sulcus extending upwards from the
inferior margin of the hemisphere to emerge on the dorsal surface just posterior to
the operculated medial sulcus. The examination of the medial surface makes it
clear that the striate cortex has been displaced downwards and is limited by a large
inferior polar sulcus—a sub-occipital operculum—which passes from the medial to
the tentorial surface ; similarly, the striate cortex has been displaced upwards and

is surmounted by the superior polar sulcus—a medial occipital operculum. The
great extent of the striate cortex, which finds accommodation within the area between
the two polar sulci and in the depths of the terminal bifurcation of the sulcus retro-
calcarinus and of the sulcus retrocalcarinus verticalis sufficiently accounts for the
fact that the area striata does not occupy that area of the lateral surface usually
occupied by the lunate operculum. On the lateral surface the situation of the sulcus lunatus is occupied by a branched
sulcus, which really consists of two separate sulci, for the upper and posterior branch
is separated from a horizontally placed sulcus by a submerged gyrus. These sulci
probably represent all that remains of the sulcus lunatus.
