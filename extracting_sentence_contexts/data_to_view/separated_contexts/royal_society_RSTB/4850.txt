Mandibles. (Fig. 13 a, b, ¢, also Plate 23, figs. 3, 4 and 5.)—These organs are the most
abundant of all the fragments of Crustacean remains found in the Chert. This is pro-
bably due to the fact that they were more strongly chitinised than any other part of the
body. They were powerful organs of the typical Branchiopod form without the slightest
trace of a palp in the adult. The triturating surfaces, oval in shape, were formed by rows
of minute denticles and some larger teeth.
