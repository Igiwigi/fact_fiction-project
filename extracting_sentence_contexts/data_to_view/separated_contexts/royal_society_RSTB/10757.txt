Iris pigmenta-
tion is also influenced by structural features within the eye
itself and by the degree of pupillary dilation [90-92]. Although skin coloration varies according to the intensity
and seasonality of UVR on a global scale, no such regular
geographical pattern is observed with hair and eye coloration
[93]. In fact, little variation in hair and eye coloration occurs
in indigenous populations outside of Europe (for hair) and
outside of Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Central
Asia and South Asia for eyes [88,89,94]. The lack of variation
in hair and eye coloration in Africa has been assumed to be
caused by the importance of eumelanin in affording protec-
tion, as it does in the case of skin coloration, but this has
not been empirically established. Hair and eye coloration
appear to have not been under as strong natural selection
as skin coloration, and loss of genetic variation at one or
more population bottlenecks probably contributed to the pat-
terns of phenotypic variation observed in the hair and irises
of modern people [95].
