things very difficult to believe; but I do not see that the numberless grades of indivi-
dual yariations already mentioned admit of being accounted for in any other way. More-
over I think that the difficulty of accepting this explanation will diminish if we cease

to regard the hypothetical plexus as presenting the high degree of integration charac-
teristic of a properly nervous plexus; but in this preliminary paper I cannot, without
undue length, discuss this subject.

(c) The strongest evidence of definite lines of discharge being present, however, is
yet to be adduced; and this consists in the following invariable fact :!â€”At whatever point
in a strip that is being progressively elongated by 8ection the contractile wave becomes
blocked, the blocking is ure to take place completely and exclusively at that point. Whereas
up to the time that the incision reached quite up to that point the contractile waves
showed no signs of meeting with any resistance in their passage from the severed strip
to the rest of the gonocalyx, immediately after the incision is carried through that point
the blocking of the contractile waves is total. Now, as I have tried this experiment a
great number of times, and always tried it by carefully feeling the way round (7. e. only
making a very short continuation of the cut after the occurrence of each contractile
wave, and 80 very precisely localizing the spot at which the contractile waves ceased to
pass into the gonocalyx), I can scarcely doubt that in every case the blocking is caused
by cutting through a very slender line of tissue which was in some way or other differ-
entiated from the surrounding tissue, and which, in virtue of its differentiation, had
