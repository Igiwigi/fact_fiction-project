The time : 2
fraction is almost a constant within the inertial region, and, consistent with the extended version : XS
of distance-from-the-wall scaling noted at the outset, seems to approach a value near 1/@ = _
0.618... with increasing Reynolds number. On the other hand, the average length (or time) : 4
associated with wv <, (Lt), increases with wall-normal distance, showing a power-law dependence tN
of the form (Lt) ~ (yt) o Consequently, within the inertial region, the number of occurrences : S
of uv decreases with increasing wall distance, whereas their length scales increase. The fact that : &

the power-law exponent of 1/®? is different from 3 is a consequence of a highly non-Gaussian
—uv PDF with a non-zero skewness. Remarkably, this skewness attains a value very close to ® in
the inertial region across all Reynolds numbers, leading us to surmise an underlying relationship
between the magnitude and length of the negative uv excursions. The apparent occurrence of quantities close to ® in various statistics of the uv motions is
intriguing, and our understanding of this behaviour remains incomplete.
