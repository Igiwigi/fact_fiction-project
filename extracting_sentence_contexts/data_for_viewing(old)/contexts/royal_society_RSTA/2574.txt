e A proof is a proof only up to the extent that it reflects a result of understanding and helps
to reproduce and transmit this understanding. A proof is only a proof for a person who
can understand it [1], and even for such persons only while they are able to keep in their
memory both the main ideas and fragments of the general context, of the techniques used
and of enough key details to control the remaining details.

e It was known to the ancient Chinese, some twenty-five centuries ago, that it is easier to
write an incorrect proof than to understand a correct one. The only way to check a proof
is to reproduce it, ie., to completely repeat the underlying computation. Checking the
correctness of an existing proof is a creative process, whose complexity is comparable
to the complexity of the search for the proof. Actually, in many serious cases, it might be
far easier for an expert (familiar with the basic ideas and techniques used) to find a new
independent proof of the same fact than to verify the details of an existing proof.

e Very few serious mathematical theorems have completely formalized proofs or, for that matter,
even such proofs that could be predictably completely formalized within the time,
computational power and other resources accessible to the human race today.

Correctness of a proof does not belong to logic, it is in the realm of Psychology and Sociology
[2,3]. On the individual level, a proof is considered to be correct provided it convinces
us of the validity of a result to the extent that we are prepared to persuade others. On
the social level, a proof is considered to be correct provided it is accepted as correct by
the majority of experts (‘a proof becomes a proof after the social act of “accepting it as a
proof”,’ [4]).
