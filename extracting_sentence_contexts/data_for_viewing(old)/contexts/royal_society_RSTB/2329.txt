of the nuclear substance as in a true sexual process. These seem good grounds on
which to base the conclusion that we have here a true—though very simple—sexual
act, leading to the formation of spores in one or both of the conjugating cells,

Let us now examine the first possibility mentioned above. Is the case before us
merely one of cell-fusions, such as frequently occur in the anastomoses between
hyphe ? There are facts among the true yeasts to support such a possibility, for
Hansen found that the germinal tubes arising from spores of Saccharomyces
Ludwigit (Hans.) often fuse along their course ;* but it must not be overlooked that
in the present case the cell-fusions occur not between growing young cells, but at the
end of growth, at a time when much nuclear substance has been accumulated but the
cells themselves are not actively growing. Moreover, although we are still in want
of information as to details, it does not appear that in ordinary cell-fusions the
nucleus, or nuclear substance, plays any essential part beyond—possibly—starting
the softening of the cell-walls, and perhaps initiating the attractive processes which
lead to the mutual putting forth of the fusing beaks. At any rate it is generally
admitted that nuclear fusions do not occur in such cases, and since in the present
instance the nuclear substance appears to mingle, and the fusions take place as a
preliminary to spore-formation, and after the cessation of active growth, the process
