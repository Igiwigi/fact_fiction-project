A glance. however, reveals a fact confirmative of the former measurements ; the daily motion of
the extreme eastern stake is 144 inches behind the maximum, while the motion of the
extreme western stake is 254 inches behind it. The stake No. 5, which moved at the
maximum rate, was also much nearer to the eastern than to the western side of the ice-
Stream ; the observation therefore corroborates those already made as regards the position

af the point of maximum motion.
8 How then is the fact to be accounted for, that the point of maximum motion of the
er de Glace is thus thrown towards its eastern boundary ? Reflection suggested to me
hat the effect might be due to the curvature of the valley through which the Mer de
lace moves. At the place where the foregoing observations were made the glacier
Sends, turning its concave side to the Montanvyert, and its convexity towards the Cha-
Beau.
