We may therefore expect the corresponding Porsson’s ratios opp and oy, in wood to be
large, and even to approach the value 0-92 in some cases.

An examination of the table in § 2 shows that these predictions are largely confirmed
by the experimental values. ‘Two notable exceptions occur, however: these are
(1) while the values of yy are, as we expected, rather large (in one case 0-836), the
values of oyy are considerably smaller ; (2) the values of o;», which according to our
model should be nearly equal to o for an isotropic substance, are generally somewhat
larger.

Another fact which the model does not explain is that Ey, is always greater than Ey,
We shallnow attempt to show that a reason for these facts is to be found in the existence
of the medullary rays.

§5. The Medullary Rays.—We have already remarked that those wood-cells which
are not arranged longitudinally are grouped into bundles extending radially, called the
medullary rays. In conifers these rays are usually small but numerous, and are
composed chiefly of very thin-walled parenchyma cells. They are generally only one
cell in width, and may vary from 1 to 20 cells in height, a common number being 7 or 8.
Some of the rays stretch right from the pith to the bark; others begin at each annual
layer and extend to the bark, the percentage volume of medullary rays appearing to
be about the same at all points in the wood. In hardwoods, besides small rays similar
to those in conifers, much larger rays may also occur. In oak these may reach as much
