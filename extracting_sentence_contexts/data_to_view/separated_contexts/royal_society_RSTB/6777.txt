These structures were almost certainly observed by Dean and figured by him, but
their significance was lost, owing to the exaggerated way in which he figured the other
‘transverse markings’ in the carbonaceous film. There can be no doubt that the
Sollases also observed at least one of them, which they figured as a displaced neural
arch (their figure 1, plate 16, vna). The presence of paired fins in Palaeospondylus is very important in connexion with
its affinities, since their absence was considered to be one of the main pieces of
evidence supporting their Cyclostome affinities: it is a significant fact that among
contemporaneous Devonian fishes the Placoderms have the pelvic girdle situated
very far anteriorly, e.g. Rhamphodopsis (Watson 1934, 1938) and Pseudopetalichthys
(Broili 19334; Moy-Thomas 1939).

6. THE UNPAIRED FINS

No traces of dorsal nor anal fins could be found in any of the material examined.
