The third deep-seated specimen is a doubtful frag-
ment of a humerus. The specimens met with near or on the surface of the third bed consist of:â€”(1) A
small fragment of a large metatarsal. (2) The third and fourth cervical vertebre, of
which the bone is of a light colour, with scarcely a trace of dendritic deposit, and
covered with a thin layer of crystalline stalagmite. These two vertebre, in fact, are in
precisely the same condition as the Horse's jaw described above. They are both stated
to have been found at a depth of 3 inches in the third bed, and at a distance of 85 feet
from the entrance, although from their aspect it would seem likely that they should
have been nearer the surface and in contact with the stalagmite. (3) A portion of
the left maxilla with four molar teeth #2 8it4. This specimen was found, as it. would
8eem, on the surface of the third bed; but it presents no trace of calcareous deposit, and
the condition of the bone and teeth, as respects colour and mineral impregnation,
exactly resembles that of the two cannonbones above described.
