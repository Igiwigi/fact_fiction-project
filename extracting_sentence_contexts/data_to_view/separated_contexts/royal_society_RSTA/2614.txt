Integration of the effect of a uniform sky shows that for such the factor should be
1-06, i.e., the same as that for sunlight of altitude 30°. For many daylight measure-
ments, therefore, it is sufficiently accurate to multiply the constant of the cell, as
found for illumination at normal incidence, by 1-06. This has, in fact, been our
usual practice, except in a few cases in which we have been especially interested in
comparing sunlight and sky light, for each of which we have then used the appropriate
factor. SENSITIVITY OF THE CELL SURFACES In order to get an idea of the intrinsic sensitivity of the surfaces of the various
cells, tests were made, using definite areas or apertures, upon the bare cells.
