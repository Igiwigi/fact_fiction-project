INTRODUCTION.

When wood is subjected to increasing mechanical stress its component parts
ultimately undergo changes resulting in permanent deformation or failure.* This
paper deals with the minute microscopic changes upon which the permanent deforma-
tion of wood depends, and with the relationship between the microscopic structure
of wood and some of its more important mechanical properties. The work has
provided abundant material for a study of the structure of the walls of the cells of
which wood is composed. Considerable light has been thrown on the structure and
properties of the vegetable cell-wall in general, and it has been possible, from the
facts for wood, to frame a hypothesis which seems to explain satisfactorily most of the
properties of cell-walls.

The examination of the mode of failure in timber, which has led to the work
described in this paper, was begun at the request of Lt.-Col. Jenkin, R.A.F. Iam
deeply indebted to him for the original suggestion of this line of work and for his
continued interest during its course. I have derived great advantage throughout
the work by discussing various engineering questions, as they have arisen, with
Major Rogerson, R.A.F., and I desire to thank him for many helpful suggestions.
I am further indebted to him for the supply of many fractured specimens of wood.
The research has been carried out, in the course of more definitely applied work for
the Air Ministry, in the Barker Cryptogamie Research Laboratory of the University
of Manchester. [ have to thank Prof. W. H. Lana, F.R.S., for encouraging me to
