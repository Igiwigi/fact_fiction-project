This observation is part of the rationale for there being a
‘second’ demographic transition [12]. The degree to which
fertility continuing to fall to levels below replacement poses
a problem depends on how one conceives of the demo-
graphic transition. For some, the emphasis is on a broad
historical process and less so on the hypothesized endpoint,
but for others the levelling off of birth and death rates is
considered as a defining attribute of the demographic tran-
sition, and the fact that fertility continued to drop requires
special explanation (along with other changes in the behav-
iour of very low-fertility societies). For present purposes we
need only note that the endpoint of the transition is a chal-
lenge for theoretical prediction and there is disagreement
on how to interpret very low levels of fertility. As such,
the possibility of fertility increase in the future tends to be
discussed as a recovery from sub-replacement back to repla-
cement levels.
