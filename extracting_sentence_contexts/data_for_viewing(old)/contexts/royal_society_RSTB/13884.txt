(i) Example

As an example, I visualize the admixture statistic F(X; Sardi-
nian, Finnish), on the first two PCs of the Western Eurasian
dataset (figure 4a). In this case, the projected n-ball (light
grey) and circle based on two dimensions (dark grey) have
similar sizes. However, several populations that appear
