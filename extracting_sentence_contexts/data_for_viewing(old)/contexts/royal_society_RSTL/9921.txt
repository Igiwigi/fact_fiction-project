366 MESSRS. J. B. LAWES AND J. H. GILBERT ON THE RESULTS OF

less (though till an excess) of mineral constituents supplied—the description and
condition of the herbage (on plot 18) were inferior; a 8omewhat larger proportion of the
produce was made up of a few of the poorer grasses ; leguminous herbage was greatly
reduced ; and among miscellaneous species fumen acetosa was more prominent.

Again, the results afford a pretty direct test of the validity of the principle ac-
cording to which all, and neither more nor less, of the constituents removed from the
land in crops, should be returned to it in manure.

In Lreprc's earlier writings he did not recognise the fact that a considerable propor-
tion of the constituents removed from the land in crops is, in the actual practice of
agriculture, periodically returned to it, and that, therefore, the loss to the oil is not
measured by the amount of constituents in the crops grown, but more nearly by that
in the produce 801d oft the farm. Further, his recommendations for the carrying ont
of his principle were confined to the application of the © mineral ” or ash-constituents ;
he maintaining that the atmosphere would supply the necessary nitrogen. Tb is true
that subsequently, in the course of controversy, he changed the meaning of his terms,
and then included ammonia-salts in the category of mineral manures. Tt is seen,
however, that even with a supply of the amount of nitrogen, as well as ash-consti-
tuents, contained in 1 ton of hay, not two-thirds of a ton of increase of produce was
obtained.
