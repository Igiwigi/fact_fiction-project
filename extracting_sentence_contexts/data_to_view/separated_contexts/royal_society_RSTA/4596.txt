Figure 2 shows two versions of the N-A parameter plane described above. In each case,
individual plotted symbols mark the simulation runs used. The vertical scale is logarithmic, but
the bottom line of simulations shown in the plots were in fact done with the friction-curve model,
in the limit where A has gone to zero. Where the symbols have a grey plus sign in the centre,
the simulation revealed that steady oscillation occurred. The pattern of these symbols matches
the prediction of the stability threshold, shown as a solid line.
