the same domain. He also notes that, because of the assumption that (q;,)ij>1 is an intensity


matrix, ||Ox|| < ||Dx|| for x € D(D) with equality for non-negative x € ¢\. These properties allow
proving, with the help of the Hille-Yosida Theorem, that all the operators

Ay:=D+rO with D(A,) = D(D), (2.5)

indexed by reé[0,1), are generators of (positive) contraction semigroups in ¢! (i.e. that the
semigroups generated by A;s satisfy (2.1) with M=1 and w=0). Moreover, there are handy
formulae for the resolvents of A,s which make it clear that (A — A,)~!s increase with r; because of
the special lattice structure of 0, these facts imply that lim,_,;_ (4 — A,)~! exists.

Perhaps surprisingly to twenty-first-century readers, Kato does not deduce convergence of
the semigroups from the established convergence of resolvents (which is easy, if the Trotter—
Neveu-Kato Convergence Theorem is available, see [9] Section 8.4.16, [4] Ch. 13, or [10]
Section 3.1.4). Instead, he argues that since the resolvents increase with r, so do the semigroups,
and establishes convergence of the latter somewhat independently. Consequently, he needs to
worry about additional issues which today are easily resolved with the help of the Trotter-Neveu—
Kato Theorem. He might have been aware of the perils awaiting those who want to deduce
convergence of semigroups from convergence of resolvents. Is this the reason why he so quickly
spotted the gap in Trotter’s reasoning?

To complete the story of [8]: Kato successfully completes his reasoning by proving that the
