In
addition, LF power, which is generally thought to be modulated by both sympathetic and
parasympathetic activity, is robustly correlated with the response duration in the midbrain. These phenomena are not affected by different processing pipelines, but cannot be evidenced
with longer TRs. This may be explained by the fact that a more precise estimation of
haemodynamic response duration requires a higher sample rate. To further confirm the effect
from different magnitude field strength, a short TR acquisition with a 7T MRI scanner would be
a great resource. With longer TRs, the associations between HRF parameters and HRV are more sensitive to the
processing steps.
