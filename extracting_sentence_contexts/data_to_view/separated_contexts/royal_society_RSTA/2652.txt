§22. Finally, a word must be said with regard to the legitimacy of our analysis,
considering the fact that if p falls to zero, «’, the resistivity, must become infinite. Regarding the matter physically, it is evident that an infinite resistivity is not likely
to introduce spurious terms into the current potential, and an examination of the
equation (1) for R will show that an actual infinity in «’ would only lead to a
zero term in R. But such an infinite term should not occur in the analysis, and it

is clear that by altering the constant term in p, so that p never falls to zero, the
above calculations become formally and really legitimate ; when we wish to return to
the actual case we must appeal to the “law of continuity,” and the fact that our
mathematics is applied to an ordinary physical problem, to allow us to pass to the
limiting value of d, in the final result.
