Received June 17,â€”Read June 17, 1841. 'THE development of the Myriapoda has hitherto been only partially investigated. It is, nevertheless, a subject of great importance to the comparative anatomist, from
the remarkable fact that it takes place in a manner entirely different from that of
most of the higher Articulata, to some of which the Myriapoda are closely allied both
in habits and structure. The true Insecta arrive at their perfect state by an aggre-
gation or apparent diminution in the number of their segments, but the Myriapoda,
on the contrary, by a repeated increase of these parts, which in many instances are
multiplied to several times their original number. This addition of segments,
during the growth of the animal, occurs throughout the whole class, and is one of its
chief characteristics.
