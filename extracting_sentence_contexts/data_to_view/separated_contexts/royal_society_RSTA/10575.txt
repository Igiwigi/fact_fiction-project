Frion and I have already published with a less general proof
(xxiii), (xxiv.), (xxvi.), (xxvii), (xlii.), and (xliii.). Instead of (xxv.) and (xxviii),
we found

Probable error of py = °67449 \/720%/,/n, and R,,,, = 1,

i.e., replacing \/96 = 9°8 by ,/72 = 8°5, and ‘866 by 1. This was due to the fact
that we considered the variations from normality to be given by a distribution of
Type III. (see p. 276). The differences, however, are not such as to invalidate argu-
ments based on the general order of the probable error of p4.*

‘We have now general relations enough to answer the following questions :—

(i.) Does the value of d found from (xxx.) differ from zero by an amount large as
compared with the probable error of d given in (xlii.) ?

(ii.) Does the skewness found from (xxxi.) differ from zero by an amount large as
compared with the probable error of the skewness as given in (xliii.) ?

(iii.) Does the value of py differ from zero by a value large as compared with the
probable error of ps given in (xxiv.) ? Tn all these questions we have a test of whether the distribution is really a random
selection from a symmetrical distribution, 7.¢., from material obeying axiom (a).
