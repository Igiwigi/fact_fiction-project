8. The second of the above propositions is proved by tracing the effect of changes
of lunar parallax and declination upon the results compared with the above formula
for the times and heights, namely,

ksin2(p—a)

y= {2?+WR+2hBcos2(p—es)} .. TY, IOIOG)

By the equilibrium-theory, the change which would be produced by any alteration of
the moon's force would correspond to the effect of an alteration in the value of #, the
amount of the lunar tide. It appears from the examination of the observations, that
this change takes place in fact, but that we must also suppose a change in z' in order
that the formula (a.) may represent the observed intervals of time. This change in
x, the retroposition of the tide in longitude, is

tan 2 (0 — 3) =

25 (p — 57) for parallax p minutes. (See Art. 15.)
84" 8in? $ for declination 3. (Art. 21.)
Now, by the theory, the effect of a change in the moon's parallax on the equilibrium-
tide is as the change of parallax; and the effect of the moon's declination is a change
