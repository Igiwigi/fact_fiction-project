248 MR. PRESTWICH ON THE GEOLOGY OF THE DEPOSITS

Somme valley was of intermediate date; but I hesitated to adopt this view until facts
could be obtained for a surer decision. The upper section at Montiers, however, which
I discovered in 1861, was conclusive as to the relative ages of the two gravels. 1
had further considered that, supposing even this relation to be established, it was possible
for the excavation of the valley to have been partly the result of some exceptional
agencies, by which the interval of time between the formation of the beds of St. Acheul
and those of St. Roch might have been shortened. But after. repeated visits to the
several districts during the last three years, and looking at the question from every
point of view, I find myself unable to discover a sufficient explanation in the direction
in which I first s0ught for one, and have been led to form conclusions respecting the
causes in operation differing considerably on some points from those I at one time
thought to be the more probable.
