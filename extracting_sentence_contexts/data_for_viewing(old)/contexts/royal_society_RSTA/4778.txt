Surprisingly, there is no quantization of the wavevector kg. In other words, the cavity supports a
continuous spectrum of modes, even wavelengths that are much larger than the size of the cavity
can be confined. Furthermore, the quality factor of these modes is infinite: there is no tunnelling
of electromagnetic energy into the surrounding vacuum.

(e) Discussion

We thus demonstrated two different mechanisms to trap light using transformation optics.
Physically, both mechanisms are based on the fact that a wave can only be confined inside a
cavity if one round-trip (approximately the cavity’s circumference) equals an integer number |
of the mode’s wavelength inside the cavity: 27a ~ 1) [34]. The hyperbolic map, on the one hand,
reduces the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave such that there are no reflected waves and
there is no round-trip. In the case of the folding coordinate transformation, on the other hand, the
phase shift vanishes completely and / = 0.

It should be noted that the parameters required to materialize these coordinate transformations
are difficult to achieve in a practical set-up. In particular, the zeros and the infinities at
the outer boundary of the cavities cannot be strictly implemented. Therefore, we have also
performed additional numerical simulations in which realistic metamaterial implementations are
