'= 0697(AS Bi eo (2005) These equations have been derived from areas of 2° square and greater and we shall
have need to estimate errors of much smaller areas. According to (29.4), (29.5),
the error would vanish when « and are reduced to zero ; but in fact we must find
that an observed value still had an error of representation of the very point at which
it was observed, namely, the error of observation, é. Obviously, so long as this is
small compared with the errors which we have just considered, we can modify our
empirical formule as follows. Thus

Root-mean-square error of representation = E, = [¢0? + {0-7 (a + p#)}2]# (29.6)

Probable error of representation = P,
