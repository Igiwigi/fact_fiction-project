Brapy has arrived at the same conclusion. But anxious to obtain the opinion of some
of our leading chemists on this point, I showed my specimens to Professors Roscor and
SCHORLEMMER, and they both express their inability to understand how 8uch a sub-
stitution could take place. I presume that on the 8ubject of organic chemistry no higher
authority than Professor SCHoRLEMMER could be appealed to. After examining my
specimens, he writes to me as follows : © I don't know what morphological evidence yol
may possess rendering it probable that the minute calcareous objects in limestone that
you showed me were originally siliceous animals or organisms ; bub T should require
8nch evidence to be overwhelmingly strong before I should accept such a conelusion,

I know of no agency by which siliceous structures could be converted into calcareous
ones, by mineralogical substitution, under the condition in which these organsms
exist, embedded'in a calcareous matrix. The fact that the silica was of animal origin does
not appear to me to render the possibility of s8uch a substibution more probable.”* l
have already shown that such morphological evidence as Professor SCHORLEMMER
demands is non-existant—hence I am impelled towards the conelusion that these
Calcisphere were calcareous, and not siliceous organisms, and consequently were nob

than @ positive one, telling what these objects really were. They are wholly unlike
