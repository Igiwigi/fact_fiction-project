There are (2° — 2)/2 = 15 distinct dichotomizations of the set {—2, —1,0, 1,2}, and the 15 subsets
W in Diw should be chosen to avoid duplication, such as in Dito) and Diy-2,-12)- Once
duplication is prevented, however, all splits of all rvs one is interested in should be included. It is irrelevant that some of them can be presented as functions of the others. In fact, any split of
our Rf can be presented as a function of just three splits, chosen, e.g. as

oo <p < _
Dy =Paay Par =Paoay Par = Parry:


It is easy to show, however, that in the subsystem

Di | Dt, | Di, || f(D},D},,Dj,) | c=1
Di | Di, | Diy || f(D},D},,Di,) | c=2

q=V q=1" q=1" q* D!

of the system D, the f-transformation of the maximal couplings of the first three columns, because
these couplings are not jointly distributed, would not determine the coupling of the fourth
column, let alone ensure that this coupling is maximal. There is no general prescription as to which rvs should or should not be included in the
system representing an empirical set of measurements: what one includes (e.g. what coarsenings

of the rvs already in play one considers) reflects what aspects of the empirical situation one is : =
interested in. Once a set of rvs is chosen, however, we uniquely form their splits and place them : S
in a canonical system. : S
