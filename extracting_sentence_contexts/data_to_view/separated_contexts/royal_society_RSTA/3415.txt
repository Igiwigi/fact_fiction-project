The first vector, go,9, describes the fact that, at t =0,
the two players have both chosen 0 (0102). Of course, such a choice can change during the time
evolution of the system. Analogously, gp,1 describes the fact that, at t=0, the first player has
chosen 0, while the second has chosen 1 (0:12). And so on. We see that Fy = {gx k,/=0,1} is
an orthonormal basis for Hg.
