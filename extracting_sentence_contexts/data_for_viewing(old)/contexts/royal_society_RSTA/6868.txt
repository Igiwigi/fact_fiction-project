Ifu, = —y orf, = y, thenw; = y or, = —y, the two spirals coincide and the region (1-2)
consists only of the resulting spiral. Hence if we know that ¢(¢) is regular and satisfies
condition A on the positive half of the real axis, we have the asymptotic expansion of
J(x) along the spiral arg x!/* = y.

If A(1/x) <}, a number fy = fo(y) exists such that, if zw. = zy and

My = 20 R(1/k) — Hos

then the region (1-2) consists of the whole plane and we can determine the expansion
of f(x) for all large x. We have always “<4 and 27 #(1/x) —4<4n, so the sector
(1-1) still lies within the half-plane #(xt) > K; in fact, the angle of the sector is

My +My = 27 R(1/k) <7.

Hence when A&(1/x) <4 we can deduce all the results of Wright (1940) from hypotheses
substantially less than those of that paper.

Since I now prove part of my former results under wider conditions, it is natural to
ask whether the present results are in some sense ‘best possible’. This is so and I give
examples of functions ¢(t) and f(x) such that ¢(é) is regular and satisfies condition A
throughout the sector (1-1), but the asymptotic expansion of /(x) takes a different form
just outside the region (1-2).
