Indistinguishability in gauge theories

The notion of symmetry is intimately related to the notion of indistinguishability. Briefly, a
symmetry transformation is a non-trivial operation acting on a given configuration such that
the initial and the final states are indistinguishable. It is a well-known fact that symmetries play
an essential role in physics [104,105]. A fundamental step in the understanding of the physical
importance of the notion of symmetry was the discovery by Emmy Noether of the relation
between (global) symmetries (defined by a finite dimensional Lie group) of the corresponding
Lagrangian and conserved quantities (i.e. quantities that do not change under the temporal
evolution of the system). Noetherâ€™s second theorem encodes a generalization of this result to
local symmetries, that is, to symmetries defined by an infinite-dimensional Lie group [106-108].
