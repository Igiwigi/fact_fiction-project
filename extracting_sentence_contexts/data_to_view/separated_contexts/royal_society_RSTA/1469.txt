While wood is valuable enough to be stored until dry, bark—with the exceptions of the cork
of oak trees and some barks with valuable substances for extraction—is often seen as an even
lower value material and frequently burnt in the wet condition to free storage capacities at the
saw mills. In the light of the limited availability of resources, it makes sense to add value to bark
produced in large volumes as a by-product of the wood industry. And in fact bark was used for
a lot of purposes in different cultures. The finding of an approximately 8000 year old bark cloth
beater in southern China is one of the earliest pieces of evidence for bark cloth making [57]. Early
bark cloth is non-woven and made by beating the plant fibres after retrieving the inner bark.
