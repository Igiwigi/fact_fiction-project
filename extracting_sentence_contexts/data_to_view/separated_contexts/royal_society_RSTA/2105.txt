The initial phase w is an arbitrary constant. As
noted in the introductory section, when the system’s continuous symmetry has been broken, an
arbitrary parameter must appear in the mathematical expression of the symmetry-broken state. This fact is true of the present case, because the limit-cycle oscillation breaks the translational
symmetry in time, resulting in an arbitrary parameter yw. In conformity to the basic idea of phase reduction, we reinterpret the arbitrary constant as a
dynamical variable, and absorb the effect of perturbation into y(t) to cause its slow evolution. Up to this point, the phase ¢ represents a one-dimensional coordinate defined along the closed
orbit C in such a way that the free motion of the oscillator on C satisfies ¢@ =o.
