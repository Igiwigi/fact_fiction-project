INTRODUCTION.

In the three memoirs of this series already published,* all the genera of living
Pteridophytes have been dealt with, excepting the Leptosporangiate Ferns. In many
features the described species and genera of the Leptosporangiatze show such
similarity to one another, that the classification of them presents difficulties to the
systematist. It will be unnecessary here to sketch the earlier history of the classifi-
cation of Ferns: it has been summarised in a compendious form by Bommer. +
Though at the date of this work systematists differed still as to the limitations and
the grouping of genera, the classification of Presi was widely accepted ; it was, in
fact, the representative classification of the middle decades of the century.

If we examine that system as adopted and modified by Sir Wiiutam Hooxker in
his ‘ Species Filicum,’ and embodied in the ‘ Synopsis Filicum,’ it will be seen that it
rests upon a narrow basis. The sexual generation is never referred to for purposes of
diagnosis or comparison ; the vegetative organs of the sporophyte are freely used, but
chiefly in the arrangement of the species within the genus; the characters of the
sorus which are used are restricted in their scope, being mainly those of its form and
position, together with the presence or absence, and the nature, of the indusium.
These remarks are not made in disparagement of the earlier systematic work, but
only in order to show its limitations, which were a natural consequence of the then
state of the science; for in the middle of the century strictly taxonomic, rather than
developmental or evolutionary interests prevailed.
