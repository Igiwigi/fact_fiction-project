in the upper part of the plates for the line H, (Plate 2)—indicates either a regular
law of intensity in the corresponding portion of the original spectral line, or a number
of components of very small separation. If in passing across the line, on the wave-
length scale, a place was reached where, through the presence of a new and sufficiently
separated component, a definitely new law of intensity appeared, a kink would be
found on the final plate in the corresponding position. No such kink occurs in the
upper portion of the H, curve, which therefore presents us with one of these
alternatives. A first inspection indicates that, for some value of n, y" = Aw should
be a good approximation to the shape of this curve, where A is positive, the axis of «
being that of the curve and the origin being at the vertex.

_ The curvature is away from the axis of «x, so that dy/dx increases with «, and
@y/da? is positive. Thus n is less than unity. The curve is, in fact, not unlike the
two branches of a semi-cubical parabola, in which n = §. ‘This property of curvature
away from the axis is general throughout the plates, as a casual inspection shows, in
all regions where the curvature appears fairly continuous, and therefore determined
by only one or by several very close components in the primary broadened line. A
single component must therefore ultimately produce, after passage through the
wedge, a curve whose equation is at least approximately of the form

y" © x,
where n is less than unity.
Consider now the curve to be expected for a component satisfying the probability

law of intensity.
