designation will be followed. From the standpoint, however, of the writer’s view
of the origin of resin tissue in the Conifers the fact that the plates are largely
composed of cellulose-pectose compounds is as important as the fact that they
contain resin.

With regard to the development of the resin plates PanaaLtow (p. 56) states
that “the resin gathers locally upon the inner face of the tracheid wall, and as its
volume increases it projects from all sides towards the centre, where it coalesces to
form a continuous and imperforate septum.” The form of the resin deposit that
I have found is not such as can be accounted for as above. It does often appear in
radial and tangential sections (fig. 41, Plate 4, and figs. 44a and b, and 47, Plate 5)
like plates or spools, but with proper stain it may be seen to line the tracheids far
above and below the transverse part. In fact where two spools come fairly near one
another in vertical sequence, the ends of the spools unite. When similar appear-
ances are found in both sections this can only mean that the deposit encloses
acavity. Smaller bubble-like cavities may also occur in the axis of the spool or in
the body of the deposit itself when this is large (figs. 44a, 47, 50, and 52, Plate 5).
There seems only one conclusion possible from this, that the form of the deposit
is due to a drying-out process or to surface tension between non-miscible fluids.
Perfectly similar deposits were formed artificially in sections by both means, The
plate itself when carefully examined nearly always reveals traces of its “ double
meniscus” character (figs. 44b and 47, Plate 5. See also the Dadoxylon section,
fig. 46).

The association of this deposit with the medullary rays (figs. 44a and 47, Plate 5)
