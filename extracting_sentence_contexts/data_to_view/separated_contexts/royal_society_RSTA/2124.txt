On the topic of energy-driven computers, there
are many research challenges yet to be solved. We highlight what we regard as the main
remaining challenges that are currently hindering adoption: development tools for energy-driven
computers, and wireless communication under intermittent operation.

(a) Simulation, emulation and debugging

Simulation and debugging of energy-driven computers is inherently more complex than for
traditional application-driven ones. This stems from the fact that energy-driven computers adapt
their behaviour according to the amount of available energy. Traditionally, simulations are
performed under the assumption of a steady power supply, so emulating the ISA and platform
is usually sufficient for finding bugs, evaluating performance and developing applications. However, to correctly simulate the behaviour of an energy-driven computer, execution, power
consumption and power production (harvested energy) must be simulated simultaneously to
correctly model their influence on each other.
