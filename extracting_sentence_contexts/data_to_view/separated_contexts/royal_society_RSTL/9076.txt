The effect of alternately
uninsulating and insulating the idle pole is therefore to vary its positive electricity
between considerable limits, and consequently its attractive action on the molecules
which graze its edge.} u

Let Â« (fig. 9) be the negative pole, b the idle pole, whose shadow falls at e; and let
b be at first 8upposed to be insulated. Molecular rays impelled from & in a lightly
divergent direction,f on passing the poxitively electrified idle pole b, are rendered
much less divergent, and bending inwards take the directions of the lines @ d d',

+ I am aware that the theory which makes these effects of deflection depend on electrostatic attractions
and repulsions is open to 8ome grave objections; still ib was that which in a great measure guided mo in
my experiments, and it could not well be omitted without reducing the description of them to a dry record

of apparently unconnected facts.
t The divergence in the figure is purposely exaggerated in order to better illustrate the argument. MR. W.
