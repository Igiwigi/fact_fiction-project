We know of no type, including Monkey, in which the outflow of dilatators is
limited to one root, and Brun’s case shows that in Man some leave by a root lower
than Ist thoracic. Yet Kiumpxe’s evidence makes it probable that they leave in
man chiefly by Ist thoracic, If so, then the evidence from the sympathetic, and also
from the phrenic, points to the nerves and muscles of this region in Man being
prefixed, as compared with Macacus and the laboratory types. This fact may be

remembered in connection with the reduction of sensory roots which seems to be in
progress at the top of the neck; the ganglion of the hypoglossal, and that of the
Ist cervical roots, both present in Ruminants, the latter present in the Cat and
Rabbit, have both disappeared in Macacus, and in Man. As to the spinal skin-fields of Macacus and of Man, clinical opportunities arise for
observing some of the latter sufficiently to give ground for brief examination of the
correspondence between the two.
