From the flattened and expanded inner and lower end
of the hyosternal (fig. 7, ks) the main body of the bone arises and curves upwards,
outwards and forwards, in the form of a long and slender rib, and applies itself to the
inner and fore part of the first elongated pleurapophysis of the carapace, extending as
far as the incipient dermo-costal plate ; the rib-like part is represented detached from
the rest of the hyosternal in fig. 5, ks. As the inner and lower toothed border of the
endo-skeletal part of the hyosternal touches the outer border of the entosternal bone,
the haemal arch of the first segment of the thoracic-abdominal case (second vertebra
of the back) is completed independently of the marginal pieces ; and, in point of fact,
the third and fourth marginal plates (fig. 8, m) are simply applied to the outer side of
the hyosternal (/) where it bends upwards to join the first long plenrapophysis (p/) or
rib of the carapace. The most obvious, and, I believe, the most natural explanation
of this first complete segment of the thoracic-abdominal region of the young Tortoise,
according to the typical vertebra, and the composition of the corresponding segment in
the nearest allied Vertebrata, isâ€”that the centrum (PI. XIII. fig.
