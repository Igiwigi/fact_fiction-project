apparent with the last series of nitrocottons, fig. 5; there is no viscosity of maximum
sorption, analogous to the nitrogen content of maximum sorption which was found
in that series. The solvation at the compatibility point, however, may fall off with
nitrocottons of low viscosity.

One is struck by the fact that a viscosity change from 25 to 120 and to 161 has a
perceptible change on the solvation while one from 161 to 2770 makes no difference.

With low viscosity and short chain lengths, the ends of the chains will play an
increasingly important part, while with increasing chain length and viscosity the
influence of the chain-ends will tend to become smaller and smaller. This may explain
why the nitrocottons MX and ML extract differ from the others. A similar effect is

viscosity, but with higher viscosities becomes almost constant. A further point is of
