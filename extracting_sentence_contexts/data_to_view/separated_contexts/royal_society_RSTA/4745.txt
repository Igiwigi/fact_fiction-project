Thus the lines of magnetic force are given by the lines defined by ¥ =¢, w=’,
where c and ce’ are variable parameters. :

Electrical Distribution on an Equilibrium Surface.

17. The surface density at any point of a charged surface on which the electricity
is in equilibrium is found from the fact that the surface-integral of the normal electric
displacement taken over- any closed surface is equal to the quantity of electricity
within ‘that surface. Hence, if E, denote the electric force normal to the surface,
and o the surface density, we have, just as in electrostatics, when there are no
charges inside the surface,
