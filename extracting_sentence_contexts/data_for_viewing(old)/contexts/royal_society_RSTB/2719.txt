1:785 is 1: 1°05, or identical with that found for the smaller specimen. This suggests
that the low anterior skull walls are closely associated with the rostral apparatus.
The ratio of 1: 1:05 is so nearly unity as to show that the rate of growth of the
parts to which it relates has been practically uniform.

It by no means follows, however, that Palseospondylus is a larval form; it would
have been surprising if no change in the relative dimensions of parts had taken place
during growth, from a length of 14 millims. up to a length of 52 millims., that of
Dr. Dran’s largest specimen.

On the other hand, the absence of any important structural changes, which might
have been expected to distinguish our smallest from our largest specimens, is a
remarkable fact, and suggests that the characters of the adult were attained at a very
early age.

Regarding Paleeospondylus as an adult form, we next pass to a discussion of its
relations to other Vertebrates.

Its claims to alliance with the Marsipobranchs have been ably urged by
Dr. Traquair, who regards the presence of rostralia about a single anterior aperture
as indicating a narial character for that opening; if so, of course, the fossil must be
regarded as a Monorhine ; the presumed absence of jaws has naturally led to the
