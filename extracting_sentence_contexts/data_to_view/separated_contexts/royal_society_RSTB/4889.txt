But if the leaves of the Caytoniales were really of the
Sagenopteris type, we cannot easily find a closely comparable form in the Northern
Paleozoic flora, and instead we must go to the dominant plant type of Gondwanalandâ€”
Glossopteris. The similarity of form and nervation between Glossopteris and Sagenopteris is indicated
by the fact that some earlier authors placed leaves clearly referable to the latter in
the former genus. There is, in fact, little to distinguish leaflets of Sagenopteris from the
leaves of Glossopteris. Though the leaves described above are generally compound
structures, some forms were simple, e.g., the rounded forms of var. cuneata, and while,
on the other hand, the specimen from the Transvaal, figured by Prof. Sewarpy as leaves
attached to a rhizome, might possibly be of the nature of a compound leaf with palmately
arranged leaflets.
