boundary with adjoining faces. The finite differences used in the equations at the
boundaries of the faces are solved by a method based on conservative principles
rather than simple interpolation.

Another type of grid used in the 1960s and the 1970s was the reduced grid or
Kurihara grid that was actually devised independently by a number of researchers
in several different forms. Kurihara (1966) wrote in detail about this grid
(figure 6). Basically, the method is to increase the longitudinal distance as the pole
is approached such that the time step does not have to decrease. Often researchers
use either spatial or Fourier filters to eliminate the smaller scale features near the
pole in either the regular spherical grid system or the reduced grid system. In any
case, this method has some undesirable computational features that have plagued
climate modelling for decades. In fact, these problems have revived interest in the
use of Buckminster Fuller’s geodesic dome idea, in which the globe is covered with
‘nearly’ uniform triangles as shown in figure 7. Some of the earliest work carried
out in this area was by Sadourny et al. (1968) and Williamson (1968).

The spectral transform method became widely used in the 1970s for solving
the dynamical equations of atmospheric climate models. The basis for this
method is akin to the harmonics in musical instruments or harmonic analysis,
where a variable used in a model can be represented in terms of a series of sine
and cosine functions if the area is a rectangle. Most introductory physics
