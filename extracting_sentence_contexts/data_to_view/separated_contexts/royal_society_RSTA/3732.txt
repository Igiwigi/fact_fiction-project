This consists in the “rather sudden fall of intensity
of the continuous spectrum at about the place of the end of the series of dark hydrogen
lines. The enfeebled spectrum continues to run on without further enfeeblement
until it is stopped by the absorption of our atmosphere.” *
This seems clearly to be the absorption effect of the matter giving the faint con-
tinuous spectrum in my plates, and the fact that the feature is characteristic of white
stars in which the hydrogen absorption is very strong points to its being due to

hydrogen itself. * An Atlas of Representative Stellar Spectra’ (Sir WiLLtam and Lady Hvaars), p. 85.
