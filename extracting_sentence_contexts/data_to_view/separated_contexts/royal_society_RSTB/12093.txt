Just by assuming that each of those cells will phys-
ically interact once with another cell during its life cycle,
hundreds of millions of interactions can potentially occur in
such a small volume. Thus, any attempt to take a snapshot of
these physical interactions necessitates the detection and profil-
ing of millions of such associations in a given experiment. In
contrast to anecdotal observations of physical interactions
from lower-throughput methods such as fluorescence acti-
vated cell sorting (FACS) [17] or micromanipulation, epicPCR
provides throughput that is limited by the sequencing effort
rather than the laboratory effort. This transforms the scale of
observations from anecdotal to a level where the ‘big picture’
of the interaction structure of a system begins to emerge. Nonetheless, such large-scale interaction profiling necess-
arily leads to detection of certain spurious and random

events.
