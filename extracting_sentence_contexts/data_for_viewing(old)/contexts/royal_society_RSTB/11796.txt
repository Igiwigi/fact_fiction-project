To highlight differences in the amount of trait data that spp.) than Amazonian species (3.9%; 389 spp.) (figure 1).
have been collected and made available for tropical versus Amax is available for only 8.5% (258 spp.) of the North American


species, and 1.2% (117) of the Amazonian species (figure 1).
Interestingly, there are more Amazonian species with leaf N
data than temperate species, but the breadth of trait coverage
is clearly greater for North American species owing to the
regionâ€™s lower diversity. As indicated above, the true pro-
portion of species represented by these traits would be
considerably lower if unnamed species and non-woody species
were included. For example, if we assume that there are, in fact,
16 000 Amazonian tree species, then only 3.3%, 2.4% and 0.7%
of them have data available for their LMA, leaf N and Ajax,
respectively. North America and the Amazon are among the
best-studied temperate and tropical systems, respectively, and
thus the percentages would likely drop even further if we
looked at other regions such as Africa or Asia.

We also investigated the functional trait data availability
in TRY for species grown at the Fairchild Tropical Botanic
Garden (FTBG, Coral Gables, FL, USA). Only 3.8% (97) of
the 2549 species at FTBG possessed any LMA data, while
fewer data were available for leaf N (3.1%; 79 sp.) and Amax
