Dr. J.O. Currr has, however, since found that equally good
results can be obtained by allowing the arc to burn between a small vertical electrode,
forming the positive pole, and a large horizontal negative electrode placed above it in
such a position that the tip of the small electrode nearly touches the side of the large
electrode. The current used is about 3 amperes. This device greatly simplifies the
taking of photographic readings, and its efficiency is proved by the fact that whereas
exposures of 30 minutes were generally given in the earlier experiments, the later plates
were taken with an exposure of only 5 minutes for a half-shadow angle of 10°. (e) Secondary and Tertiary Standards of Wave-Length.—The value of the iron are varies
very greatly in different parts of the spectrum, according to the accuracy with which
the wave-lengths of the lines have been determined. The principal series of data are
as follows :—(i) Fasry and Buisson in 1907* published a series of 106 wave-lengths
from 2373-737 to 6494-994 of lines in the iron-are spectrum deduced from the primary
cadmium standard by measurements with an interferometer.
