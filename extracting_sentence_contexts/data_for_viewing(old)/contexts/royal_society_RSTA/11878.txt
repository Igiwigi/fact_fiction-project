during, say half-an-hour, when the period reaches 25 sec. or 30 sec., and, of course, it
always happens that these periods of magnetic peace only occur when we want to
measure comparatively low resistances. The fluctuations have, moreover, all the
appearance of being due to general causes, for they appear equally at night-time when

nothing in the Laboratory is being moved, and when there is no traffic in the road.
They are always bad on a windy day; but this may possibly be attributed to small
changes of barometric pressure occurring from wind pressure. We are placed at
about 150 yards from a road along which a steam tram runs, and every time a tram
comes past, the needle moves about violently ; in fact, we often obtain the first
indication of the approach of a tram from the motion of the needle. All these draw-
backs can only be eliminated by increasing the efficiency of the magnetic screen, and
this is therefore the next step to take.

Method of Observation.â€”In order to obtain the maximum reading for a given
Ghrrent, we always obtain a double deflexion, and read the first elongation of the
eedle. Whether this elongation be produced by the current through the sulphur or
Ey the derived circuit from the Clark cell, there is practically no induction in the
grout, except that in the galvanometer itself. If the derived circuit current be
ljusted to give the same throw of the galvanometer as the leakage current, we
wnsider that the currents must be the same.
