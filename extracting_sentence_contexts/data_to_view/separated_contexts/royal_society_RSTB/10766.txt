Interestingly, irregular nuclear
ical chromatin (DNA packaged with histones), and the shape and compromised nuclear scaffolding has been
putative nuclear matrix/scaffold. The evidence now that observed in transformed and cancer cells [53,54]. In fact,

XIST RNA interacts specifically with SAF-A and other proteins XIST is functionally compromised or mislocalized and the


Barr body is not observable in some cancers [55,56]. Therefore,
we suggest that immortalized cells may have a ‘weakened’
nuclear matrix and looser embedment of XIST RNA. Similarly,
pluripotent stem cells, which also require SAF-A for XIST
expression/localization, have less developed nuclear sub-
structure and express very low levels of the nuclear matrix
protein lamin A/C [57,58].
