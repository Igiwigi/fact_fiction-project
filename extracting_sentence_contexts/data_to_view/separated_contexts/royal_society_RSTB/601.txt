20th day.—Sensibility tested by dipping the feet in hot water; right foot withdrawn after 14 seconds ;
left foot after 3 seconds, so that there is still some delay. Left knee-jerk markedly exaggerated. Temperature, right popliteal space, 103°8; left popliteal space, 101°°8; surface temperature of right
foot, 86°; left foot, 80°: that is to say, the skin temperature on the paralyzed side is now lower than
on the non-paralyzed, no doubt due to the fact that the vaso-motor paralysis has passed off, for the
plantar surface of the foot is now neither swollen nor dry. The animal is frequently seen to flex both
hip, knee, and ankle on the paralyzed side. It was put into the large cage to run about.
