portional to any non-zero row (column) of

adj (2? J— AM), (1:37)

IfA,>0, it is seen, after some elementary calculations, that the last row and column of (1°37)
are non-zero. Their elements can be expressed in terms of the polynomials

4,(E) (v= 0,1,2,...)-

In fact, with a suitable choice of a factor we find that
