This
follows immediately from the torsional rigidity, decrement, period, and angular value
of one division. No uncertainty so great as this appears in the mean deflections

The Laboratory and Accessories (Plate 2). The apparatus is set up in the vaults under the Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford, to
fit which, in fact, it was specially designed. I cannot sufficiently express my obligation
to Professor Cirrron for giving up to me entirely for four years this very perfect
observing room, for not only was I able to make my observations under specially
favourable conditions, but I have had the advantage of having at hand the resources of
his splendidly equipped laboratories, and of being allowed to make any use of them
that I desired. I feel that Professor Crirronâ€™s kindness in the matter is the greater
as I have no claim upon him whatever, and I can only hope that in so far as my work
carried out in his rooms may represent progress in practical physics, he may feel
justified in having sacrificed to this end his best observing quarters.
