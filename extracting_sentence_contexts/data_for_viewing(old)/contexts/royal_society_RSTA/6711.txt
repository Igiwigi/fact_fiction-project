show that the intersection of 311, 311 is only coincident with that of 004, 022 and 022 for
Cu Ka, radiation, and not for Cu Ka,, Cu Kf or Zn Ka.

The same is true of the intersection of the 313, 313 circles, which occurs at a point A”
along the direction OA, but at an angular distance from O given by

Spacing or lattice constant measurement

Since A, A” and A” do, in fact, coincide for a particular and accurately known value of A,
a precision determination of the lattice constant a can be made by solving the equations

= fi tan-! 1—cos~! = 4
2/10a 6 /2a°

This may be done graphically (knowing a approximately), and it is found that for
A = 1537-400X (Wennerl6f 1930; Bearden & Shaw 1935), the equations are satisfied when
a = 3559-7X; but the variation of OA” or of OA” with small changes in A/a is not so marked
that it is possible to determine a to a greater degree of accuracy than is given by the first
place of decimals of X units.

The points A are not, however, the only points from which an estimate of the lattice
