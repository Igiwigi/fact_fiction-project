proportion. It is extremely probable, then, that the tem-
perature, produced by the union of the hydrogen and oxygen
forming part of any mixture, is the circumstance which de-
termines the combustible gases to unite, or not, with oxygen
by means of the sponge. It was desirable, however, to ascer-
tain the exact temperature at which each of those three gases
unites with oxygen with the intervention of the spongy plati-
num. For this purpose the gases, mixed with oxygen enough
to saturate them, were 'severally exposed in small retorts
containing a platinum sponge, and immersed in a mercurial
bath, to a temperature which was gradually raised- till the
gases began to act on each other. In this way the following
facts were determined.

15t. Carbonic oxide began to be converted into carbonic
acid at a temperature between goo* and g10* FAHRENHEIT.
By raising the temperature to g40*, and keeping it at that
point for 10 or 15 minutes, the whole of the gas was acidi-
fied, the condensation of volume in the mixture being equi-
valent to the' oxygen which had disappeared.

2dly. Olefiant gas, mixed with sufficient oxygen, and in
contact with the sponge, showed a commencement of decom-
position at 480? FAuRENEEIT, and was slowly but entirely
changed into carbonic acid by a temperature not exceeding
