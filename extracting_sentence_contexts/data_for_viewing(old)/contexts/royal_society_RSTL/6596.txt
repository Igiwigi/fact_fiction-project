Dy ing from the external forces. If, therefore, L, M, N be the components of G, L, M, N
= must be respectively equal to the components of D(H). Hence we haye

E L=A:+(0—B)a,w,
Z M=B:+(A—C)o,T,

5 N=0®:+(B-A)=,w.

We thus ee that these well-known equations of EuLs are found at once by resolying
D\(H) along the principal axes, where H is the axis of the body's momentum-couple
and has Aw,, Bo,, Cw, for its components, and that they merely express the fact that G,
the resultant of I, M, N, is identical with D(H).

62. The theory of the motion of a body about a fixed point can be more simply inves-
tigated, and the problems connected with that theory can generally be more easily solyed,
by merely bearing in mind that G=D(H) than by using EvLER's equations, which
merely expres that fact in one particular form; for that form is not always the most
convenient form, and is in all cases apt to conceal the fact which it embodies.
