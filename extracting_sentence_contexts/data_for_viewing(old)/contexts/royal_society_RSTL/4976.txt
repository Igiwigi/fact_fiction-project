identity of these two plants, but a further argument in favour of such identity was afforded
by the occurrence of the perithecia of the Cytispora and of the Spheria within the same
cireumscribing line. Spheria verruceformis belongs, as is well known, to the division
Lignosw, one of the characteristics of which is the existence of a black line surrounding
the base of the stroma, in which the perithecia are imbedded. If a thin section of the
substance of this black line be examined under the microscope when the Spheria is ripe,
it appears to be composed of dry carbonaceous matter in which it is hardly possible
to trace any structure; but if examined at the period of growth of the above-mentioned
specimens, it, is 8een to consist of strings of oval cells of a clear dark brown colour.
Precisely similar cells are frequently to be seen near the base of the perithecia of other
species of Spharia, which doubtless belong to the mycelium, and I suspect therefore
that the black line above alluded to, and which has been supposed to be the outer coat
of the stroma, is in fact formed by the cells of the mycelium. If this be 80, the occur-
rence of the Spheria and the Cytispora within the same circle would seem to make it
reasonable to assume that the two are the produce of the same mycelium.
