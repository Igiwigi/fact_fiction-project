No reasonable change in the value of R will bring these quantities into better agree-
ment, nor can any alteration in » be countenanced. It is true that changing » from
4 to 3 will make the calculated constant /1s — V 2p 76, but this would upset the doublet
separation relations and the variation of 1/q with Z. The point is not worth stressing
since the formule are only approximate, and 1s — 2p, departs from a linear law far
enough to account for the discrepancy. It is quite sufficient to see that the orders of the

quantities agree. The important fact is that ~/I1s — +/2p is as constant as it turns out
to be.

The discrepancy in thesequence Au I, etc., is of the same order; thus, Ts—V 2s ty fe
and the calculated value is 117. No change of » will here bring the results into coinci-
dence so that the effect of changing n in the Cu I sequence is probably accidental.

(ii) The outer levels.—When g levels can be used, it is found that the resulting f terms
are hydrogenic in magnitude, This justifies our method of calculating the terms by
assigning to the g level a value nearly corresponding to a hydrogen orbit of the same
quantum numbers in a simple Coulomb field (with the central charge of appropriate
magnitude). The d levels are of interest, inasmuch as the quantum defect is very small,
and would change sign as the ionisation increases, if n, = 3, Were retained throughout.
