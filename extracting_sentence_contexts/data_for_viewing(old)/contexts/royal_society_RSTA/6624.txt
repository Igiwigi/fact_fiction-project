for the best breadth, 2b = 27 —1 + e+ a/

F)

where ¢ is the excess used for soldering.

Therefore, for any breadth the length must exceed the breadth by as much as the
breadth should exceed the length when that is given. In other words, the circuit is
improved by adding to it ad infinitum, so that a square of infinite size is the best
rectangle. If it should happen that ,/(CW/w'v) + e < 1, then the circuit in the same
way would be made worse by increasing the dimensions. As a matter of fact, in the
particular case, taking e as 0, this quantity is equal to 8°24.

If, on the other hand, d is less than 1, then the quantity 2b —1-+ e in the two
equations above must be replaced by b)-+1-+e, a quantity necessarily positive ;
hence, whether 0 is less than or greater than 1, the circuit cannot be too large.

If the same process that has been followed in finding the best conditions with respect
to weight be employed to find them with respect to moment of inertia, a difficulty
arises in consequence of the fact that the upper end or cross wire of the circuit has a
resistance which depends upon its length simply, while it has a moment of inertia which
is only one-third of what it would have if it were placed alongside of one of the side
wires of the circuit. Thus, while the expression for 7 remains as before, viz.,
