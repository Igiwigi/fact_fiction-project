With the earth's power and the

thick wire ring. We know from former considerations (3206.), that if the 300 inches

wire, it does not seem at all unlikely that by increased delicacy and perfection of
the instrument, by increased velocity, by continued motion for a time in one direc-
tion and then reversal of the revolution with the reversal of the direction of the
swing, &c., it may be applied with advantage hereafter to the investigation of the
earth's magnetic force in different latitudes and places. To obtain the maximum
