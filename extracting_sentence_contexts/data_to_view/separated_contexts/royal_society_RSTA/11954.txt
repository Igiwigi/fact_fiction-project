When the quantity of silver diminishes, and consequently the vapour exerts
less pressure, being mixed with the vapour of other metals, the bands become narrower
until at last nothing but lines remain, and these are the strongest lines belonging to
the strongest bands. They correspond to those on the spark spectrum with wave-
lengths 3382°3 and 328071. Thus we see how the line spectra are related to band spectra, and that there is
really no essential difference between the constitution of the matter which enters
into the vapours of metals and metalloids; there is, in fact, something in their
constitution common to both, which is apparently dependent on their vapour
pressures and probably due to the action of the molecules upon one another when

freedom of their motions and the result is a continuous spectrum,
