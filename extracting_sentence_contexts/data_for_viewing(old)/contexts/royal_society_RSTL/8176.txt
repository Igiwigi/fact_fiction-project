204. Since the equation

+1 +2 +u(a* +1 +2 +203+1?) + pR*=0
is that of a sphere into whose equation an arbitrary constant enters in the second degree,
its inverse with respect to any point will be a sphere into whose equation an arbitrary
constant enters in the second degree ;' that is, the inverse of « Cartesian cyclide will be a
eyeclide- generated as the envelope of a variable sphere whose centre moves along a plane
conic. Tt will therefore be @ binodal cyclide.

This also appears from the fact that the inyerse of a focus is. a focus; and since the
Cartesian cyclide has three collinear single foci, the inverse surface will haye four con-
cyclic single foci, namely the inyerses of the three collinear foci and the centre of
inversion.

205. If we differentiate the equation (138) of the generating sphere with respect to j,
we get

+ +2 +2a7+1*+2pR*=0;
and if from (1+) times this result we subtract the equation (138), we get

2ar ++ (2p +p?)R*=0.
