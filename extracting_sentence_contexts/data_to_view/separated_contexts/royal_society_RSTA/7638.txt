If the magnetometer has a
slight pendulous swing, its field will induce currents in the cylinder, and the field of this
current will react on the magnetometer. If the cylinder is not perfectly centred or levelled,
it seems possible that a net couple might be produced leading to a systematic error depending
sensitively on the centring and levelling. Asa result of these larger errors for small values of z it will be noticed from table 11 that
the standard error of the final determination of Wis lower for z = 9-4cm than for z = 7:-6cm,
in spite of the fact that at the smaller distance twice as many readings were taken and the
S expected field is 50 % larger. For large values of z, the error of W will be larger again owing
& to the reduction of the expected values. Thus one can conclude that better results would have been obtained by making more
measurements at values of z of about 9 to 10cm.
