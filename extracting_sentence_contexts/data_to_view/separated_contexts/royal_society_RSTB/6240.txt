Apart from the faculty for
budding, the zooids are almost indistinguishable from the solitary individuals of the
genus Polycarpa. In Distomus variolosus and Stolonica socialis budding is more rapid,
with the result that the colonies are composed of smaller but much more numerous
zooids. In Symplegma viride the zooids are smaller and more numerous again, and
apart from the fact that each zooid has an atrial siphon opening independently to
the exterior, they resemble closely colonies of Boéryllus or Botrylloides. The zooids of
the last two genera have atrial apertures opening into common cloacal cavities instead
of independently to the exterior, and the zooids in consequence become arranged in
systems. Species—Polyandrocarpa tincta VAN Name.
