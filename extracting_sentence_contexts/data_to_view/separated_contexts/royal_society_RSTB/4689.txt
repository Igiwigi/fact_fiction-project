A casual glance at the sections might perhaps
suggest that the intermedialia push their way inward, and in this way produce the
curvature of the membrana elastica externa in the horizontal and vertical planes ; and
it-is not quite clear that ScHavurNsLAND did not intend to convey such a meaning
when he wrote* that they “ dringen erst nachtriiglich in sie [the membrana] hinein.” As an actual fact, the distance between the inner portions of the two lateral inter-
medialia is slightly greater in the adult than in the late embryo examined. Fic. 8.—A, Mustelus vulgaris, adult, post-cloacal vertebra, x5.
