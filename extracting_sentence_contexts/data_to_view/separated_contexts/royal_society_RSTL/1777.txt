It is in- fact the
case of the source of positive electricity, being, the mercury
itself, instead of 'its being conveyed to it from a pile at a
distance. 27. Having thus distinetly traced the alteration in the me-
chanical effect by contact with the negative pole, to the amal-
gamation of the mercury with sodium, the knowledge of this
fact led me to investigate more minutely the effects of diffe-
rent metals in their contact and amalgamation with mercury ;
and the results T have encountered in the course of these en-
quiries, appear to me 80; remarkable, that I cannot forbear
annexing them, especially as they afford an explanation of
almost every. anomaly which perplexed me in the com-
mencement of the investigation.‚Äù In order to render the effects
less liable to objection,.as well as more distinct and striking,
I now used solutions of potash or soda, pretty highly impreg-
nated with the caustic alkali, for the conducting liquid.
