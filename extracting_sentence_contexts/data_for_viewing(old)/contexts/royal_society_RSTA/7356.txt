component.

Finally, we assume that the machine adjusts itself in the Lanchester manner about each of
the three axes. This is perhaps more difficult to imagine in lateral than in longitudinal
motion, but as basis for a first approximation has the same validity in both.

The fourth and sixth equations of (18-9) give that

Lv’ +1,s'q’P+1s'q'R = 0,)
r (20-3)
and nv’ +n,s'q'P+n,s'q'R = 0,
to the first order. Now it is a well-known fact that, of the six rotary derivatives con-
tained in (20-3), /, stands out as predominantly large. In fact J, is a quantity of order
— 1, while of the other five derivations only /, is at all large, namely, like 2. We therefore
suggest that, in our first approximation, we can take P = 0.

This suggestion is much nearer the truth than appears on the surface at first. For
if we take the typical values of the rotary derivatives we find that by adding four or
five times the second equation (20-3) to the first (20-3) we get P = 0 with considerable
accuracy.

We therefore obtain the following equations for the first approximation:

gees =—sin@, q'Ru' = cos@sing, —q'Qu’ =cosbcosd—u'"?, P=0; (20-4)
