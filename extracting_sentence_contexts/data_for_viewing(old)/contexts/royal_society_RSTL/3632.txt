translucent, but s0on becomes more opake. Its shell is soft and elastic, and, when
exposed to the air, quickly becomes dry and $hrivelled. It is on this account very
difficult to preserve it to watch the changes in the embryo. Of at least a dozen
packets of eggs which I obtained this spring, I have succeeded in rearing only one,
which happened to be the packet first deposited, as just described. It is owing, pro-
bably, to this difficulty in rearing the eggs and the young of the Iulide, that the
changes of these animals have been 80 imperfectly known, and that so much want, of
precision has been found in the observations of those who have most attended to this
subject. Thus Dzcexr, who first watched the development of these animals, de-
8cribes them as possessing 8ix legs when newly hatched*, while M. Sav1 states that
they are completely apodal; and Wacaf, in his excellent observations on this
class, confirms the statements of Sav1, but is exceedingly vague in parts of his ac-
count of the changes, and has entirely overlooked many most important facts in
regard to the production of the new segments.

In my own investigations these difficulties were in part guarded against by filling
a thin glass tube with moistened clay, in which a little cavity was formed for the
eggs close to the glass, and when the eggs had been carefully removed into it the
hole was closed up with clay, and also the tube with a cork. By this means the
eggs could be watched from day to day, with a common lens, through the glass,
without being exposed to the atmosphere. In this way the changes were easily'ob-
8eryed ; and one or more eggs were removed from time to time for closer inspection
beneath the microscope, care being taken always to close up immediately the hole in
the clay. The specimens were examined both in the recent state, and also after
they had remained a few hours in $pirit of wine, s0 that the changes were accurately
