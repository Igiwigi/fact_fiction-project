A por-
2 tion of dark reddish-brown chloride, formed by combustion of the metal in chlorine,
Z gave the following results: 06958 grm. chloride yielded 19939 grm. Ag Cl, and 0:3383
S& grm.V,O;. Hence the chloride contained 70-8 per cent. of chlorine and 27:3 per cent.
of vanadium; the difference between these and the theoretical numbers (73:46 and
© 26-54) being explained by the fact that the metal operated upon contained a slight
—V admixture of oxide. V Heated in an atmosphere of pure nitrogen, metallic vanadium at once absorbs this gas
6 and is converted into mononitride.
5 Vanadium attacks all glass or porcelain in which it is heated, a compound of silicon

A and the metal being formed. This compound coats all tubes of glass or porcelain in
which the chlorides have been heated and reduced, as a grey lustrous metallic mirror, the
formation of which renders the tubes very brittle and liable to crack.
