Sench, Pike, and Perch), a fact, which taken in conjunction with the absence of
"B glands,” satisfied him that in the richly glandular Amphibian skin the source of the
Eur. must lie in the secreting structures. Hermann himself, previous to his
@xamination of the skins of Fish, shared to some extent the opinion of pu Bors, for
“#1 a paper published in 1878 (3), he inclines to the idea, that preparatory processes
éf glandular origin are the cause of the E.M.F. of the current of rest in the skin of the
Frog, but also advances the supposition of a possible contribution from epithelial
‘Betion at the surface. Finally, as is well known, Hermann demonstrated the
resence of an ingoing current of rest in the skins of some ten genera of Fish, but
und that its E.M.F. was far less than that exhibited by the Amphibian skin. After
noting that substances, the application of which destroys the current of rest in
Amphibian skin, cannot be traced microscopically beyond the upper layers of epi-
dermie cells, and recalling the fact that an electromotive excitatory change was
demonstrated by Bacu and Ornter (4), in the skin of the Frog, after complete
removal of the current of rest, by the action of corrosive sublimate applied to the
outer surface, HERMANN concludes that the E.M.F. of the current of rest, and that of
the current of action are of different origin. In speaking of the origin of the current
of rest, he makes the following statement, upon the strength of his demonstration of
such a current in the “non-glandular” skins of Fish, “dass nicht, oder nicht in erster
