* The intercentra are known under very different names : chevron bones, wedge bones, os en chevron,
Zwischenwirbelbeine, Gabelknochen. They occur among the Amniota in reptiles, birds and in the tail of
some mammals (Marsupialia, Edentata, Cetacea). They are also described in the lumbar region of Erinaceus,
Talpa (Lun1, 1922, p. 314) and Atherura (Bepparp, 1902, p. 24).

} That, of the cervical intercentra, only those of atlas and axis undergo chondrification has been
proved by Sontus (1907, p. 411) for Gallus and Anas, and by JAgur (1924, p. 3) for Gallus.


THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN IN BIRDS. 337

occurrence of more than one pair of dorsal and ventral arcualia in one metamere by the
fact that the protovertebral plates curve like an 8 and overlap. Each protovertebra
consists of a myotome and two sclerotomes, of which one is ventral and one dorsal.
The dorsal half of a protovertebra is bent medianwards and caudalwards, the ventral
half lateralwards and cranialwards. The reconstruction of a series of sections through
the tail of a 7-mm. embryo of Seyllium catulus shows that: ‘(1) The dorsal half of
selerotome 2 grows downwards and comes to lie behind the ventral half of sclerotome 1.
(2) The ventral half of sclerotome 2 lies in front and below the dorsal half of sclerotome 3.
(3) The formation of a physiological unit is effected by the combination and fusion of the
unequally numbered sclerotomic halves, so that the dorsal half lies behind and above the
ventral half.” “‘ If A and B mean two successive sclerotomes, a and b their dorsal,
« and @ their respective ventral halves, then the new scleromere is composed of b +- «,
A+B B dorsal , A ventral ,,
