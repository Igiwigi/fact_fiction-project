386 W. G. BICKLEY ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF STRESS

where only the cyclic terms in the displacement formule have been written down. To
ensure that the displacement is single-valued, we must have :—

B,/By = $(1 —o); Ai/Ap = — 3 (1 —8)

The formuls for the displacements have now served our purpose, and will not be
further dealt with. A simple calculation, or indeed the known facts, will show that
in any practical case, the displacements are very small. (3.6)

(4) Normal pressure varying as cos 0 over the internal circular boundary of an otherwise
infinite plate. As a first example, before embarking upon the general solution, we solve the problem
for a normal pressure varying as cos 0 applied to the boundary.
