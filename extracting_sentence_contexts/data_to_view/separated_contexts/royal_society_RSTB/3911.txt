It was impossible to be absolutely certain of many of the points in the
descriptions, as the examination of the hybrids had to be confined to observations
on the living animal, as we wished to keep as many of the hybrids alive as possible. It is remarkable that we have never been able to keep the pure-bred urchins ot
Â£. acutus alive for more than a few months after metamorphosis. This is, moreover,
singular, from the fact that the cross #. esculentus 3 x E. acutus $ grows very well
under laboratory conditions. We have had to rely, therefore, in our description of
E. acutus, on material obtained from the trawl, the exact age of which is unknown. Small #. acutus are very seldom brought up by the trawl, and we have never been
successful in obtaining any at Plymouth smaller than 2 cm. across the test.
