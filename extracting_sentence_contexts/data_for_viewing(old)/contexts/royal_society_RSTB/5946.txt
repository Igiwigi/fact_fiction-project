close to the side of the wound, on account of some influence exerted by the wound on
the neighbouring tissues. But this cannot be so: for after many of the isolations of I,
reported previously, in which the wound was broad and rounded at the top, it was
found that I, arose with its central part in contact with the sloping side of the wound,
and with its stipule extending over the top of the wound (1931, p. 21).

In the six experiments in which I,k did not extend above the wound (section 11), the
distances of its centre from the wound were usually rather less, though again much more
than could be expected on Scnouts’s theory. They ranged from 37° to 65°, the mean
being 48°, and in five of these six experiments I,k was imperfect, its stipule next to the
wound being abnormally small. But reasons were given for considering that these
imperfect I,k leaves resulted from operations made late in the plastochron, and this
fact helps to explain them. For when P, is split in a similar manner, then a very
imperfect leaf often develops from the larger part of that primordium as we have found,
with its stipule next to the wound very small or absent. Consequently it can be under-

‘stood that when I, is split late in the plastochron, at a time when it is probably already
partially determined, an imperfect I,k leaf arises.

When Ia arose alone, it was apparently never an imperfect leaf, but in three experi-
ments it was a bract, such as often develops from one or both parts of P, when split.
The interpretation of these bracts is discussed in sections 7 and 11. It is possible
indeed that the Ia leaves which did not extend over the wound may have been slightly
imperfect, though too slightly to be detected, in the same manner as the I,k leaves and
for the same cause. For this reason the estimate of 62° for half the minimum arc’is
