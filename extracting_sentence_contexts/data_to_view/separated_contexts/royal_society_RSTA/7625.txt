G which would be produced by a rotating body
of reasonable size in the laboratory, led me to conclude that the experiment would perhaps be
possible but would certainly be exceedingly difficult. However, a much easier but still worth-while subsidiary experiment presented itself. This was to
test whether a massive body, in fact a 10 x 10 cm gold cylinder, at rest in the laboratory and so
rotating with the earth, would appear to an observer, also rotating with the earth, to produce
a weak magnetic field with a magnitude of the order of 10-* G. That such a field might exist is a
plausible deduction from a particular form of the Schuster-Wilson hypothesis considered in some
detail by Runcorn and by Chapman. This paper describes the design, construction and use of a magnetometer with which this
‘static-body experiment’ was carried out.
