Though this rubble-drift in some of its phases sometimes simulates the characters
the other drift deposits, I found it impossible to reduce it to the terms of any of
ose others. Whereas these latter are spread out in beds more or less horizontal,
d keep to definite lines, this drift drapes the hills, follows divergent directions,

differs essentially in its main characteristics from that of the other drift deposits. here is an entire absence both of marine and fluviatile shells ; the remains found in

state and by the absence of wear, whether of the broken fragments or of the
