In order to obtain the results shown in figure 7, for each of the blends the g
yarameter was varied relative to its experimentally fit value and the theory was
hen used to predict the subsequent shift in the critical temperature. We therefore
oroduce four series of ‘theoretical’ blends, using each of the experimental blends
as a starting point. Despite the fact that there are significant differences not only
in the interaction strength but also in the nature of the phase separation, the
heory predicts the same shift in critical temperature for a given relative shift
in mixed interaction. This apparently predictable dependence of miscibility on
