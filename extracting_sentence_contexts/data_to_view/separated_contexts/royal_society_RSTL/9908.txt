The s0lution of earthy sulphates soluble in potassic sulphate was precipitated
with ammonie oxalate. The precipitate ignited with sulphuric acid, and tested in
a radiant matter tube, gave the citron spectrum with great brilliancy (25, 33). Chemical facts connected with the citron body.

36. Certain chemical facts concerning the behaviour of the sought-for element
which came out, during the course of the tentative trials already described had
considerably narrowed the list amongsb which it might probably be found. All the
evidence tended to show that it belongs to the group of earthy metals, consisting of
aluminium, beryllium, thorium, zirconium, cerium, lanthanum, didymium, and the
yttrium family, together with titanium, tantalum, and niobium.
