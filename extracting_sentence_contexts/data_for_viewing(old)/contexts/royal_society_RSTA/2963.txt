The notation hcr(0,0) was used in equation (6.7) due to the fact that sin?(y/2) =hio /N? =
(64/24N?) nae 0 and hence yp — 0 (and the choice #9 = 0 was already justified earlier). The value

of N becomes very large for vanishing foundation stiffness because N* = J + fz and the actions
are both normalized by k; and thus their sum becomes large for k; — 0 because in the impact
regime at least one of the (non-normalized) actions is at least finite (and positive).

The subscript ‘cr’ was used for both the Hamiltonian and the coupling due to the fact that
some of the assumptions used in the asymptotic derivations presented above are justifiable only
in the case of considerable energy exchange between the modes, which for the generalized LPT
corresponds to the critical case.

The fact that the result yp > 0 was obtained means, in a sense, that the LPT in the considered
system is similar to what was studied in other systems, including in [49]. However, in the case
considered here, the condition yp — 0 does not correspond to action localization in the sense that
Ji =0, which was the case in classic applications of the approach. In this sense, the definition
presented in this and the previous sections is a generalization of the concept of LPT.

In conclusion of this subsection, it would be instrumental to relate N to the ICs in the original
system. If we wish the LPT or the generalized LPT to represent the impulsive perfectly localized
