(and that in consequence its maximum occurs at a shorter wave-length) than for solid

THE SOFT X-RAY SPECTROSCOPY OF SOLIDS 113

In the case of insulators and semi-conductors, the considerable diffuseness of the
false edge, and the low intensity of the sharp short wave-length limit makes the bands
relatively insensitive to temperature effects from a practical point of view. In the
case of Si, experiments with the anticathode temperature varying between 110 and
600° K failed to show any noticeable difference in the band shape. This does not
necessarily apply to very high temperatures. In fact, Hautot and Serpe (1937) report
a certain smoothing out of the features of the boron K-band when emitted from an
anticathode at a temperature of about 1800° K. For such experiments, boron is
probably a suitable element. Farineau (1938) has reported an appreciable change in
the shape of the Al K-band when emitted from the liquid metal at about 1100° K,
But when we attempted the corresponding experiment with the L,,-band, we found
that the metal either alloyed with the base metal of the anticathode (in this case
tungsten), giving a grey powder deposit which seems to consist partly of Al,O,; or if
we attempted to keep a considerable mass of Al under the focal spot of the X-ray tube
by tying a piece of metal on to the anticathode, it simply flowed away when melted.
Thus we are inclined to be doubtful about the interpretation of Farineau’s result as
due purely to melting.
