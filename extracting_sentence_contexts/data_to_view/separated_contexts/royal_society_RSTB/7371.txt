It is exemplified in connexion with the basic proteins of cell nuclei by the pro-
tamins, salmine and clupeine, present respectively in the sperm heads of the salmon and
herring, and the histone present in the sperm heads of the cod. These three proteins are
clearly homologous proteins for they occur in the nuclei of similar cells and must therefore
possess identical functions. The two protamins resemble one another closely in composition
and were, in fact, at one time, thought to be identical. It is, however, now certain, as
will be shown on p. 592, that they possess different compositions despite the small differ-
ences between the analytical results recorded in table 5. That the homologous histone of
cod sperm is a different protein from the protamins has, owing to its marked difference
in chemical and physical properties, never been in doubt.
