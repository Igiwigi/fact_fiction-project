Some, however,
have been able to discern humanoid characteristics in the teeth, while others, failing to
agree, have been satisfied to regard the jaw as that of an ape which by chance came to lie
in the same geological deposit. The comparisons set out in this paper do not directly qualify any statements that have
been made about the humanoid proportions of all these teeth. They show, however, that
many supposed divergences in shape and size from the apes have little, if any, foundation
in fact. Indeed, hardly one of the teeth considered in this paper cannot be matched in
dimensions and shape by the corresponding tooth of at least one type of extant great ape. In some cases, moreover, all or many of the teeth of a fossil correspond with those of one
type of modern ape.
