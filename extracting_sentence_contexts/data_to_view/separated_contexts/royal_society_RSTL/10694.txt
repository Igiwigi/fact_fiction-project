Such electrodes have been constantly in use for producing sparks
from which photographs of the spectra of saline solutions have been taken. Fresh
electrodes have generally been made for each solution, but they may be used over
again repeatedly provided they be well washed with hydrochloric acid and water. They wear away rather quickly, bub their durability may be indicated by the fact
that the same points have actually been employed continuously for a period of ten
hours. Each of the two pieces of graphite should be sharpened 80 as to resemble
a chisel, the edge of the one heing exactly superposed aboye that of the other, while
both are placed in a line with the slit ; the movement of the 8park is thus restricted
to a direction backwards and forwards, but always in front of the slib and not to one

side or the other. Graphite electrodes (actual size).
