point and those which have been allowed to undergo the change. (See Plate 7.)

Fig. 25 is a photo-micrograph (magnification 1000 diameters) of a specimen of an
alloy containing 16 per cent. of tin which has been kept at 175° C. for six weeks, and
has then been quenched in liquid air from a temperature of 160°C. Seen under a
» low magnification this specimen appears practically homogeneous, but the high power
used in the photograph reveals the presence of a large number of very fine white
patches; from their behaviour and appearance these undoubtedly consist of free tin,
but their minute size and their distribution over the specimen, as well as the entire
absence of any spots or markings within the white patches, indicate that this tin is of
“secondary” origin, having been separated from the solid solution during cooling. To
some extent the presence of this tin in the quenched specimen is probably to be
ascribed to the fact, that the rate of cooling employed was not great enough to
entirely suppress the change occurring at the recalescence. Figs. 26 and 27 are
photo-micrographs of a piece of the same ingot as that represented in the previous
figure, but in this case the specimen has not been quenched, but has undergone very
gradual cooling from 150° C. to the ordinary temperature. The mottling of secondary
tin is much more pronounced in these specimens, the quantity of tin being much
larger, while it is also aggregated into larger masses. Since the appearance of a
specimen quenched from a temperature just below the recalescence is very similar* to
that of this specimen, it follows that the transformation in question has involved the
rejection of a considerable quantity of tin from the solid solution.

Figs. 28 and 29 respectively represent typical sections, under a magnification of
1000 diameters, of quenched and slowly-cooled alloys containing 18 per cent. of tin.
