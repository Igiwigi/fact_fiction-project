M. Cavcuy has, I consider, given a satisfactory theory of chromatic dispersion,
which is perfectly consistent with every thing which has been advanced in the pre-
sent theory. But I claim for the latter that it gives a satisfactory account of the
phenomena of absorption and the spectral spaces discovered by FRAUNHoFER, and com-
monly known by the name of Frauxnorr's lines, especially when taken in connexion
with the consideration of {luminous resonance, to which subject, I think, the attention
of scientific men is here directed for the first time. In fact, according to the laws of resonance, those rays will act most forcibly on
the medium, which find amongst the particles of the latter s0me capable of vibrating
in unison, or in harmonic consonance less perfect than unison, with themselves, the
unison of course giving rise to by far the most energetic action, but the other cons0-
nances producing effects more decided as the coincidences of phase are more frequent ;

we ee therefore in general why particular rays should be selected for absorption, with-
out any insensible gradation, and why some lines of absorption, those corresponding
to nnizon for example, should be more strongly marked than others ; and these pre-
liminaries being conceived, then comes the equation

Sin 0=(1+9)Â£ sin 0,

which explains how those rays which undergo absorption are turned out of their places
and deflected towards the less refracted end of the spectrum, and in some cases,
though with intensities 80 diminished as to be imperceptible, far beyond the limits of
the visible spectrum. In fact as s increases, the above equation shows that 0, increases. 'Phe refracted ray is therefore turned more from the normal, or deviates less from its
original course than it would do if there were no absorption, in which case $=1).
