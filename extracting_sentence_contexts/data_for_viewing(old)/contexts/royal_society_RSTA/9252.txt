formed at it, of the exit slit of H, so that no part of this image is obscured.

For the normal use of the colorimeter in measuring the colour of materials, the window
of the instrument consists of a lens of clear colourless glass, having a focal length of
about 20 em. The specimen is placed at the focus of this lens, and the light passes
as a collimated beam through the matching prism, after which a second lens, at the
inner end of the observation tube, produces an image of the specimen in the plane of
the observation pupil. The purpose of this is to prevent any structure possessed by
the specimen, for example, the texture of fabries, from appearing in the field of view
and destroying the sensitivity of the match. For measurements on the spectrum, if
the slit of the monochromator is situated at the focus of the lens-window, an image
of the spectral line is formed at the observation pupil of the colorimeter and the test
field appears filled with light of the appropriate colour. Owing, however, to the fact
that the spectral light is concentrated within the limits of a narrow slit at the observer’s
eye, the appearance of the field is marred by streaks and other defects, due partly to

strie, dust particles, ete., in the optical system, and to the ‘‘ musce volitantes ” pro-
duced by non-homogeneity in the media of the eye itself. Such a system is, in fact,
of the type which one would arrange for the purpose of showing up such defects.
Further, while the spectral light is confined to this slit-aperture, the instrument primaries
are not, but completely fill the circular aperture of the observation pupil of the colori-
meter. The fact that the spectral light is, in effect, seen through a different observation
