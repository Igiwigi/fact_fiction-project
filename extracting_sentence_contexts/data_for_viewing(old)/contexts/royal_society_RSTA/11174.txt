lines H and K of the solar spectrum appear in most, possibly in all, cases. There is
perhaps nothing surprising in this, owing to the presence of calcium in the dust of the
air, and the probability of its occurring as an impurity in many metals. But what is
surprising is the great intensity of these calcium lines, as compared with those of the
metal proper when the poles used are silver. We deposited some of the metal
electrolytically, and Mr. J. Crowrner fused the deposit into poles on a block of
willow charcoal, which contains only a very small amount of ash, but we must admit
the possibility of some traces of calcium having been taken up by the silver in the
process.

The silver so prepared gave not only the H and K lines, but also the line at 4226,
with undiminished vigour. We do not offer any explanation as to the possible
sources of calcium, either in the metal or in the dust of the air, but the fact is
rendered remarkable by the appearance of the lines in question when the spectrum is
taken on the rotating wheel, Fig. 27 is a photograph taken on the stationary film
without self-induction, and the H and K lines are seen strongest near the centre of
the spark, With self-induction, the strongest lines of the spectrum are those of
calcium. In fig. 28 the dise was spinning, and there was no self-induction. The
lines H and K present a comet-like appearance, K being much the strongest.
The head of the curve corresponding to the K line is displaced towards the
violet, and if our interpretation of these curves is correct, the photograph seems
to prove that the H and K vibrations start not at the pole, but in the centre
of the spark, and luminosity begins not when the main initial discharge strikes
through the air, but, roughly speaking, about the 200,000th part of a second
afterwards, when the luminosity of air as shown in our photographs has completely
