(3) The second collimator was omitted and the rays from the flint-glass prism of the
spectroscope were reflected by means of a right-angled prism through the aperture in the
plotting-board on to the prism of the reducing lens system, suitable lenses being mounted
in the plane of this aperture so that a sharp image of the spectrum was projected on to the
latter.

Of these methods, the third was found to give the most satisfactory results, so far as ease
of adjustment and brilliance of illumination were concerned. With regard to the spectral

purity given by this method the facts are as follows: an image of the observer’s pupil is in
effect projected by the second lens of the reducing apparatus, that is the objective, into its
own upper focal plane. With a 4 mm. pupil, a distance between instrument and observer
of 1-8 m., and an objective of 40 mm. focal length, the size of this image is approximately
0:10 mm. Now an image of this aperture is projected by the first lens of the reducing
apparatus into its own upper focal plane. This lens, the eyepiece, has a focal length of
60 mm. If then the tube length is 160 mm., the Ramsden disk will have a diameter of
0-03 mm. It i§ this small aperture which selects the part of the spectrum which is to be
transmitted to the observer’s eye. The spectrum was approximately 30 mm. in length. In
consequence, approximately one-thousandth part of the spectrum is transmitted at any
one time to the observer’s eye. This is approximately equivalent to 3A for a ray of medium
wave-length. For long waves the purity will be less and for short waves the purity will be
greater than 3A. It was considered that this degree of purity was quite sufficiently high
