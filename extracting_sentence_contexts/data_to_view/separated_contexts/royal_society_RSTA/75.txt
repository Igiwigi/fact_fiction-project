If V(t) decays exponentially fast in time, we say the flock has a fast alignment property. Theorem 2.1 shows the flocking property for strong (Lipschitz) solutions of the non-local
alignment system (1.1). In fact, the following fast alignment holds for strong solutions of both
CS and MT models. This is quantified in terms of the following interaction bound, which will be
used throughout the paper:
