Finally, given some resistance from a part of the scientific community, it is important to argue
in favour of using the name Hawking radiation to describe this phenomenon in analogue systems. Here, we argue why the name is appropriate and call for a generalization of the term Hawking
radiation to include the same effect in systems different from astrophysics.

2. Astrophysical Hawking radiation

In the first half of the 1970s, Jacob Bekenstein’s ideas about black-hole thermodynamics [37] were
spreading and gained even more relevance once Hawking deduced his famous relation! between

1n fact, Hawking asked for this equation to be written on his grave stone on Westminster Abbey, UK.

This deduction works for black holes formed by gravitational collapse and whose event horizon : gS
is an apparent horizon in view of its finite creation time. If the mass of the star is larger than :3

counterbalance its own weight and it collapses into a black hole. Some of Bekenstein’s equations relate the entropy with the surface area of a black hole and

resemble the usual laws of thermodynamics.
