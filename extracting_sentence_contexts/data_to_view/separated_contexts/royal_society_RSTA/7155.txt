These errors were computed for each station and combined as if they were independent
(which, strictly, they are not). The Palaeozoic is distinguished from the Mesozoic by the difference between their
fossil contents, and since seismographs can only find lithological discontinuities, the
interpretation of the data in terms of the geological column must involve considerations
outside seismology. It involves in fact the following of a lithological feature identified in
a bore-hole or at an outcrop into a region in which its depth is not known. This following
of a known feature is the crucial point in all applied seismology; the lay-out of the
stations and the length of the lines must be chosen so as to reduce the chances of losing
the selected horizon and of mistaking another for it. This possibility may be much re-
duced by arranging the stations in lines, the ends of the lines being at bore-holes.
