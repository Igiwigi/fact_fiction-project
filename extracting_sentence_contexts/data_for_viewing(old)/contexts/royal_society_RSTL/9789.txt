first 8ight it would seem that the numberless long and mobile feet —to say nothing of
the spines—would be sufficient to convey all the information that the animal requires
concerning the external world, without its exterior requiring to be rendered sensitive
over its whole surface. Yet we find, 80 far is this from being the case, that the
external surface cannot be touched with a needle's point. at any part without the
whole animal being affected thereby. We have already deseribed the neryous plexus
whereby this general sensitiveness of the external surface is secured. We must now
enter pretty fully into the functions of this plexus as revealed by sundry experiments
on the multitudinous and wonderful system of organs which, either directly or
indirectly, depend upon this plexus for their innervation.

These organs are the ambulacral feet, the spines, and the pedicellarie. That all
these organs are in nervous connexion with the external plexus is proved by the fact
that when any part of the external surface is touched, however gently, all the feet,
spines, and pedicellarize within reach of that point, and even far beyond, immediately
approximate and close in upon the point, 80 holding fasb to the needle, or whatever
other body may be used as the instrument of stimulation. This simultaneous move-
ment of 8uch a little forest of prehensile organs is a singularly beautiful spectacle to
witness. In executing it, the pedicellarize are much the most active, the spines some-
what lower, and the ambulacral feet, very much slower. If the object with which
the external surface is touched be itself small enough, or presents edges narrow
enough, to admit, of the forceps on the pedicellariz establishing a hold upon it, ib is
een to be immediately seized by some of these organs, and held there till the spines
and ambulacral feet come up to assist ; but if the object is too large, or does nob
present- any surfaces which the pedicellarize are able to catch—such, for instance, as
