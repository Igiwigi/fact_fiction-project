At
temperatures below 12.6mK, the reference temperature was provided by a pulsed !Pt NMR
thermometer which was read out by PLM4 electronics.>

Figure 3a shows the power spectral density of flux noise obtained using the cross-correlation
method at different temperatures. The recording time for one cross-correlation spectrum was
400s leading to a statistical precision of better than 1% for the given bandwidth of about 100 Hz. The fact that the overall shape is in very close approximation identical for all spectra indicates

that the resistivity of the noise-generating copper piece did not change in the entire temperature 6 |
range on a relevant level as expected. The solid lines through the data points of each spectrum
assume an identical spectral shape and fit each dataset very well. According to (1.2) the prefactor â€œ3
of this fit is expected to vary linearly with temperature.
