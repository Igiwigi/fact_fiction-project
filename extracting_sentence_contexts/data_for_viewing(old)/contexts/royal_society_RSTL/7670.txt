into two subclassesâ€”one containing those properties in which the numbers found are
above those calculated, and a second containing those in which they are below.

Class I.
a. Specific heat.
Heat produced by mixing.
b. Boiling-points.
Capillary attraction.
Class IT.
c. Rate of expansion.
d. Compressibility.

On examining these in detail some remarkable facts will be noticed. In subclass a,
Specific Heat, it will be seen, by Table VII. and Plate LXTV., that the first addition of
alcohol to water, though alcohol has a specific heat much less than that of water,
= actually raises the specific heat; 80 that a mixture between 30 per cent. and 40 per
cent. has the same specific heat as water.

On comparing the elevation of specific heats found, above the theoretical specific
heats calculated as above, with the amount of heat produced by mixing, it will be seen
(Plate LXTV.) that mixtures producing the same amount of heat possess the same elevation
of specific heat; and further, if the number of units of heat produced in the formation
of any mixture be divided by 3:411 in each case, a number is obtained which expresses
the elevation of the specific heat of such mixture above its theoretical specific heat.
