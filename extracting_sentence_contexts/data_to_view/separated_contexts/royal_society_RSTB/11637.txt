We fit two statistical models (LR and RF) to forecast ion con-

centrations and EC in streams in Germany. The model
findings may on the one hand directly inform on potential

First, owing to the selection criteria for the sampling sites ents in lithology and climate. On the other hand, the
(less than 5% agricultural and urban land use in the catch- models may be adopted in other European regions with simi-
ments, no mining) and owing to the fact that we relied on lar major drivers in stream chemistry to begin to establish a
data monitored by the respective federal authorities, the continent-wide assessment of both current and future
sampling sites were spatially unevenly distributed and changes in salinity. The results of EC projections show a
some areas of Germany lacked sampling sites (figure 1 and slightly elevated conductivity in German streams in the
electronic supplementary material, figure S1). Therefore, period from 2070 to 2100 under climate change.
