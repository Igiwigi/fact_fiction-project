A little consideration, however, shows that, when this is so, our formula is very
readily corrected so as to take this difficulty into account, without involving any
lengthy numerical computation.

If we consider the formula

Aw, = mf {At2+ (E—AE,M/A,) t,4}/{1+ (B—E,M2/A,) t2}

it is clear that it leaves the development of Az, in powers of ¢, unaltered as far as
the second order inclusive. It alters the coefficient B, of B so as to make the two
leading terms agree with (69). It also alters E in such a way as to remove the term
in M® and reduce E to a quintic. In fact it gives for the new E the remainder obtained
after the first step in the division of E by A, according to the usual process.

In practice, the terms in (E,/A,) M’ are very readily added as follows :-—

At, +Ex,'/(1—E,M%,/A,)
1+Be2/(1—E,M%2/A,)

Aa, = nf

and this amounts to applying the same corrective factor 1/(1—E,M%t,"/A,) or
1/(1—En,*t,?/n2A,) to the second terms in both numerator and denominator. This
factor, expressed in terms of the inclination of the incident ray, is independent of the
