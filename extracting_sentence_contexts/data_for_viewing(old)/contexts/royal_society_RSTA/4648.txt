a single simulation to the timeseries. None of these methods, however, considers the strong
and random temporal variability of many sea-ice-related parameters. Doing so allows one to
obtain a more realistic estimate of internal variability, as considering temporal variability can be
interpreted as a synthetic extension of ensemble size. This then results in a much larger estimate
of internal variability than that given in previous studies.


In order to estimate an internal variability from such a synthetically increased ensemble size,
I examine 30-year trends from the CMIP5 archive that start between the simulated years 1975
and 1984. This results in 10 possible trends for each individual model simulation. I then assume
that a plausible range for any observable is given by the range of simulation results from those
models that capture the observed value in their range of simulations. This reasoning is based
on the fact that we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed evolution of the climate
system follows a rather unlikely extreme trajectory for the given change in forcing. Hence, for
any observable those models that have the observed trajectory at the extreme upper end of their
simulated trajectories must currently be assumed to be equally likely to be correct as those that
have the observed trajectory at the extreme lower end of their simulated trajectories. Unless we
obtain an independent estimate of internal variability, the range obtained is the possible range
of climate trajectories. Hence, any individual simulation that falls into this range cannot per se be

rejected as unrealistic. : =

One could argue that individual models can nevertheless be rejected, namely if the observed : yy
trajectory of the climate system does not fall into the modelâ€™s ensemble spread. This reasoning 2
would be correct if the ensemble spread of those models that submitted several simulations to aes
