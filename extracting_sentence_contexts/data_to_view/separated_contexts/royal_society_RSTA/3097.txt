With (3.20) and (3.21), evaluation of the
matrix elements reduces to the same integrals as in the relaxation time approximation,

(3.22)

and we get

It should be noted that, for Maxwell’s molecules, evaluation of the relaxation rates for
various moments can be done in closed form without specifying the distribution function,
also for the nonlinear collision operator [15,20], and relaxation rates (3.23) and (3.24) are
valid for the full nonlinear case; more on this in §11.

(iv) For other particle collision models such as hard spheres or other power law potentials,
functions M[CyCg — 35apC"] and M[C,(C? — =) are not eigenfunctions of the linearized
collision integral any longer, and evaluation of the matrix elements (3.23) and (3.24) gives

It is well known that first approximation jg is reasonably close to the exact value, in
particular for hard spheres [1,18]. This fact, however, does not imply that corresponding
eigenfunctions of the linearized Boltzmann collision integral are in any sense ‘close’ to
those for Maxwell’s molecules, and it is therefore misleading to judge on the quality of
Grad’s approximation for hard spheres on the basis of viscosity coefficient alone. We shall
return to this discussion later. We now continue with finalizing Grad’s G13 approximation by writing down closed-form
equations.

(c) Grad’s system

Substituting Grad’s closure relations for the Q- and T-fluxes (3.8) and (3.11) into balance equations
(2.17) and (2.18), and also using any of the above realizations of the relaxation terms, one arrives
at Grad’s equations.
