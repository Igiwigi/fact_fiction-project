These are solutions in the form
ew (p) for the profile equation (1.2), which are well understood in the literature. In fact, its
existence and uniqueness [1-3] in all dimensions and appropriate values, namely p € (1, pn),

was shown in [3]. Furthermore, the stability behavior of these (unique) solutions is also well
known [4]; this is in fact one of the main classes of examples that was worked out within the
Grillakis-Shatah-Strauss formalism [4,5]. Concisely, these waves are spectrally /orbitally /linearly
stable for p € (1,1+4/n) and unstable for p € (1 + 4/n, p*) [6]. It is worth mentioning, however,
that the ground states conform to our set-up only in the case of n=2, as p there is the global
radial variable, whereas we are proposing here an ansatz with [1/2] pairs of radial variables.
