MAHALANOBIS ON LARGE-SCALE SAMPLE SURVEYS

correlation function is likely to throw some light on the theory of design of experiments in
the case of non-random fields.

108. It will be noticed that the treatment adopted here is a kind of generalization for
two dimensions of the method of serial correlation in the case of time series on which a large
volume of work is already in existence. In fact, in many instances results for serial correlation
are capable of being extended in two dimensions without difficulty. But, as can be easily
seen from the above discussion, many new problems arise in the case of the two-dimensional
correlation function which have no analogue in the case of serial correlation.

109. For simplicity the concept of correlation function has been developed with reference
to the unitary configuration type of sampling.
