These vertical sections or abruptions of our strata are
by no means. confined to the steeps that line our coast ;- the
remaining boundary of our basaltic area has several of them

equally grand; and similar abruptions, or sections (though
not 80 deep) are scattered over a great part of our area, and
especially on the ridges of our hills and mountains which are
cut down in- many places like a stair, bythe sudden abrup-
tion of the basaltic stratum.

9. Wherever the strata are thus suddenly cut off, whether
it be. a mass of accumulated strata as in the facades on our
coast, or solitary strata in the interior ; the materials on one
s8ide of the abruption- are completely carried away, without
a fragment being left behind, while on its other side the un-
touched stratum remains intire and undisturbed. I shall not proceed to apply these facts to support, or in-
validate, any: of the numerous theories which have given rise
to '80 much controversy, in which I myself (as you know)
have borne: some part ; I'shall look to nature alone, without
much reference to opinions; and'shall endeavour to trace, by
the marks-$she has left behind her, some of the grand opera-
tions she once executed on the surface of our globe. Varro divided the time elapsed since the beginning of the
world into three | portions, which he. distinguished by the
names, prolepticum, fabulosum, and historicum. The first-comprehended the period of absolute darkness ; in
the second some faint lights were thrown upon the history of
its events, by fable and tradition ; in the third, the historian
had the common aids from which history is usually compiled.

- The natural history of the world seems'to admit of a cor-
responding division.
