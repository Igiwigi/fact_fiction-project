F.R.S.

Read June 22, 1809. Dear SIR,

Is the © Observations on a Current that often prevails to the
« Westward of Scilly,” which I had the honour to lay before
the Royal Society many years ago, I slightly mentioned, as
connected with the same subject, the effect of strong westerly
winds, in raising the level of the British Channel ; and the
escape of the super-incumbent waters, through the Strait of
Dover, into the then lower level of the North Sea. The recent loss of the Britannia East India ship, Captain
Bixcn, on the Goodwin Sands, has impressed this fact more
strongly on my mind; as I have no doubt that her loss was
occasioned by a current, produced by the running off of the
accumulated waters ; a violent gale from the westward then
prevailing. The circumstances under which she was lost,
were generally these :

In January last she sailed from her anchorage between
Dover and the South Foreland (on her way to Portsmouth),
and was $00n after assailed by a violent gale between the west
and south-west. The thick weather preventing a view of the
lights, the pilot was left entirely to the reckoning and the lead;
and when it was concluded that the ship was quite clear of

the Goodwin, she struck on.
