WarERHousE have a constant and exclusive character in the structure of the enamel;
that the Sciuride have another character ; that the first and second sections of the
family Muridz possess a third ; and that the remaining sections of that family possess a
fourth well-marked character, and the Leporidz a fifth. Iam told by Mr. Warzrnouss
that these results are of great importance, as affording evidence on the position of
several species whose place in the order has not been definitely fixed, either by their
external characters or by the structure of the skull, and hence they have been variously
placed by naturalists, and even by the same author at different times.

Before entering on a description of the structural characters that pertain to the
teeth of the rodential families, or of individual teeth, it will be desirable to state those
conditions which are common to the whole order, otherwise it would be necessary to
repeat frequently the same fact. It bas long been known that the incisors of Rodentia
have the property of unlimited growth, and that the rate of growth equals the rate
of loss by wear; hence the exposed portion of the tooth is, in the normal state of the
dental apparatus, maintained of uniform length. The pulp-cavity in a longitudinal
section of the tooth is irregularly conical or wedge-sbaped, and in a transverse section
corresponds in some measure with the outline of the tooth. The dentinal tubes pass
from every part of the cavity outwards and upwards towards the surface in more
or less curved lines.

The tabes which proceed from the cavity near the base of the tooth, are in many
cases perceptibly larger than those that are situated higher up; hence it follows,
that, as the latter were once near the base of the tooth, the dentinal tnbes undergo
a diminution of calibre after their formation. In the teeth of the Sciuridz, I have
