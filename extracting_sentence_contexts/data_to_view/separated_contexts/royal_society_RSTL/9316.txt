The uniformity in direction in which both the time of transpiration under
pressure (se Tables XIV. to XVII.), and the ratio of the thermal differences of
pres8ure to the mean pressure (Se Tables IIT. to XIIL.) vary as the density increased. IV. The fact, sufficiently proved by GRAHAm, that, ceteris paribus, the times of
transpiration are proportional to the ratio of the differences of pressure to the mean
pressure, the difference of pressure being small.

V. The fact, to a certain extent taken for granted, that the ratio of the thermal
differences of pressure to the mean pressure are, exteris paribus, proportional to the
ratio of the difference of temperature to the absolute temperature, this ratio being
gmall,

VI. The continual approximation towards constancy of the time of transpiration
under pressure as the density diminished.
