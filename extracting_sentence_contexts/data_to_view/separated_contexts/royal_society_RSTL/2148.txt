These relations have been shown to dif-
fer according as the body is luminous, or not ; in the one
case, the direct heat affects bodies in proportion to the dark-
ness of their colour, without regard to the texture of their
surface : in the other, the magnitude of the effect depends
solely on the absorptive texture without reference to colour. I
use the term © absorptive texture,” to signify that peculiar
state of division in the particles of the surface, which has
been shown, by Professor LEsLIE and others to be most sus-
ceptible of the influence of simple radiant heat, and always
to give a proportionally greater radiating power. The question then is entirely one of facts ; and involyes no
hypothesis as to the nature either of light or of heat. The
object is simply to ascertain by experiment, whether, of the
total heating effect radiated from a luminous hot body, the
portion intercepted by a transparent screen is of the same
nature as, or different from the part transmitted in its rela-
tions to the surfaces on which it acts. (6.)
