great part of the field, and its final disappearance, establish it as a distinct variety of the |

same affection.

In yet a third case which T have recently met with, the blindness is sometimes brought
on by looking at a striped wall-paper or a striped dress. The appearance before the eyes
is described as zigzag, wavy, quivering, without colour. The first attack, in adult age,
was followed by partial paralysis of one side; and later attacks have almost always had
a sequel of defective speech, and tingling at the tip of the tongue, at the tip of the nose,
and in the fingers and thumb.

I think I have accumulated evidence enough in the foregoing pages to establish the
fact that there is a distinct form of transient hemiopsia, presenting the following main
characteristics :â€”

1. Dependence on mental anxiety, bodily exhaustion, overwork to the eyes, gastric
derangement, want of exercise.

2. Origin from a small spot near the centre of vision.

3. Orderly outward spread from the original spot.

4. Blindness to boundaries, but not to general impressions of light and colour.

5. Luminosity in the dark.
