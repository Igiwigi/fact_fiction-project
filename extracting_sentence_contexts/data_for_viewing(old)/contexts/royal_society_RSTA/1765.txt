approximations, equation (2.6) can be converted into a form which highlights very clearly the
significance of IFAR. As explained by Atzeni and Meyer-Ter-Vehn [25], by making some simple
approximations for the different variables (including assuming constant acceleration over some
fraction of the capsule radius), the equation

1 1/2
G) =exp E (<Ee-) —a3-1-(IFAR)!], (2.8)

can be derived. / is the spherical harmonic mode number, and the three w values are numerical
constants. This expression describes RT instability growth at the capsule outer surface during
the acceleration of the shell inwards, but equivalent expressions can be derived describing feed
through of this growth to the inner surface of the shell, and to describe the growth at this
inner surface during deceleration; both of these also depend on IFAR [25]. The fact that these
assumptions lead to formulae for the instability growth that depend only on IFAR for a given
mode number demonstrates the importance of this parameter for controlling instabilities. An
upper limit of 30 has been selected for IFAR in this work; this value is typical of the acceptable
IFAR when using this equation, as capsules with higher IFAR’s have been observed to break
up over the course of the implosion [19]. However, recent research has found that reducing the
IFAR further still may be necessary to prevent instability growth [42,43], suggesting that further
investigation of this regime may find reducing this limit to be beneficial.


Adiabat is also known to have an effect on instability growth, as lower fuel adiabats lead to
lower ablation velocities and lower density scale lengths, which results in larger instability growth
[44]. This is again a compromise, as reducing fuel adiabat results in increased 1D gain. Varying
