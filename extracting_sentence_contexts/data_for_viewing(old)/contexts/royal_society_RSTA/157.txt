aspects together. Approaches seeking to constrain the stochastic processes from
observations and CRMs appear promising, along with basic principles such as
care to conserve moist static energy.

The manner in which observations of precipitation, water vapour and

emperature collapse to simple dependences expected from critical phenomena
summarized above is highly suggestive. The fact that some of these properties
occur commonly in simple systems, including lattice models as seen in the
yarallels between figures 6 and 7, suggests that we ought to be able to capture
hem in our convective schemes. The fact that some properties are universal
implies that they do not provide a test of whether a system contains the correct
ohysics for convection, but systems that aim to represent the statistics of
convection should include them. It also suggests that systems simpler than fully
resolving convection can be devised that will include some of these properties
hat have now been so clearly observed for convection.

One promising approach, adapting lattice models for use at the subgrid scale,
1as been initiated (Majda & Khouider 2002; Khouider et al. 2003). While the
specifics of the moist physics based on CIN do not match the observations here,

he approach is adaptable to different physics, whether from meteorology or
other systems (Katsoulakis et al. 2003). The key points of neighbour interactions
