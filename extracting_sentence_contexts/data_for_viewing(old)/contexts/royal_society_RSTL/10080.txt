patches. Tt is of a gray or buff colour, and usually highly calcareous. It is often
filled with comminuted bones not determinable ; but evidently of small Batrachians
and probably of Zylonomus. Fragments of chitinous matter also abound in some of
the coprolitic masses. In most cases they 8eem to belong to Millipedes, but in a few
examples insect remains occur. They are not determinable ; but in one specimen was
a well-preserved fragment of a head apparently of a small neuropterous insect showing
one of the compound eyes. Fragments of shells of Pups are found in and near 80me
of the coprolitic masses, and I think it probable that these pulmonates formed a part
of the food of some of the Batrachian epecies.

Some doubt mnst of course exist as to whether the substances contained in the
coprolite represent the ordinary food of the amphibia or only that to which they had
access while imprisoned in the erect trees. The facts 80 far as they go would indicate

Millipedes and Pup.

The additional facts obtained in relation to these I have detailed in a paper com-
municated to the American Journal of Science.* Pupa vetusta proves to be by
far the most abundant species. A very few crushed specimens of Zonites priscus
