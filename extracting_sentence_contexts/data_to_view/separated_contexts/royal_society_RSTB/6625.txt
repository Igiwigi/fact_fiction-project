The frequency of occurrence of the three types, expressed in terms of
percentages of the total numbers of orders, families, genera and species examined,
is shown in Table VII and fig. 1. The effect of artificial selection is demonstrated by
the fact that while over 50°%, of the species examined contain delphinidin derivatives,
yet as the scope of the subdivisions is increased to genera, families and orders cyanidin
proves to be the more widespread. 100%

The complete list of flowers examined (Table V1) is based on the system of classi-
fication put forward by Hutchinson (Hutchinson 1926). The dicotyledons are arranged
in two major divisions, the Archichlamydeae and the Metachlamydeae.
