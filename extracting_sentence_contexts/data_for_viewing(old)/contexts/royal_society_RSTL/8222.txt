BRrtoxE remarks that this condition is probably the normal one during life, since he has
most frequently come across it in perfectly fresh living muscle*. It is not difficult to
Uidentify Bxricke's isotropous substance, which he also terms Zwischensubstanz, with
Sthe heads of the isotropous muscle-rods above described. But it may be asked, How
omes it, that in dead muscular fibres, especially if they have been placed in alcohol and
Szubsequently mounted in Canada balsam or dammar-varnish, even though apparently
fully extended, we 80 often observe broad alternating stripes of anisotropous and
Ssotropous substance ? To this I would answer that, although these fibres are not,
Actually shortened, yet the elements composing them have tended to asnme the con-
Alition that ordinarily accompanies contraction of the fibre (see below). And this
-Spinion is fully confirmed by Brtcxr's statementf, that the isotropous disks are always
:Sroadest in such fibres as have been prevented from shortening at the time of death.
t is, in fact, as if we took a fibre that had become fixed at death in the contracted
tate and mechanically stretched it out to its original length; in which case we may
Feadily conceive the anisotropous and isotropous disks which are present in that state of
he fibre to be equally stretched out.

take place during the contraction of muscle in the disposition of the structures which I
Have endeavoured to describe.
