ges are effected, appears to haye been given by Professor Broke, of Vienna, in
2852+, and the subject has since been yery carefully investigated by Dr. vox WrrTmIcn

Smother and also with those of neighbouring cells, constitute a delicate network in the
Substance of the true skin. 'They describe the dark contents as sometimes concentrated
the bodies of the cells, at other times diffused throughout the branching processes,
