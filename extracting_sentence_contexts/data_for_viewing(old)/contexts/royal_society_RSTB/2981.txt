departure we have met with in Lagenostoma Lomaai from thé constant number of
nine peripheral bundles. That this is a case of a bundle forking on its way up the
seed rather than a fusion of two bundles depends, of course, on the correct
determination of the relation of the two sections. In the absence of any trace of the
chalazal tissues or of the canopy or pollen-chamber in either of the sections, the
recognition of W. 1931 as the lower section is based on the relative diameter of
the intermediate sack in the two sections in question. In W. 1931 the sack is
2 millims., and in Kipston 260 it is 3 millims. in diameter. As the intermediate
sack is well known to expand like a funnel in its passage up the seed (e.g., specimen
1930, phot. 5), there is no doubt the smaller ring belongs to the lower section.*

The peripheral position of the bundles, as determined by the specimen U. C. L., R. 7, b
(fig. 29), and the fact that they run into the free part of the integument or canopy,
seems to stamp the bundles as definitely appertaining to the integument of the seed.

Turning now to the structure of the seed-bundles, it is mainly the xylem strands
that are preserved. In the transversely cut chalazal bundle in the specimen, 8. 236
(fig. 4), the xylem is shown with its smallest elements at the centre. In the slightly
disorganised zone of soft tissue which accompanied the xylem strand it is not possible
to differentiate the phloém. The very similar section U. C. L., R. 8, @ (phot. 13)
shows the position of this zone, but it is much more disorganised.

The chalazal bundle is cut in longitudinal section in the specimen W. 1930
(phot. 7, v.b.). The enlarged drawing (fig. 5, p.a.) shows the small protoxylem
elements to be centrally placed, thus confirming the indications given in the
