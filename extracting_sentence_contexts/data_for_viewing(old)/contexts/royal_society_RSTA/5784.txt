in non-integer dimension, studied in [124] using a fractal Fourier decimation, possibly e.g. with
the help of fractional derivatives [125].

Moreover shear, an integral part of the definition of helicity, has been shown recently, for
rotating and/or stratified fluids as well as for (Hall)-MHD turbulence, to have a central role in the
formation of strong small-scale localized structures, an interpretation of which can be performed
for example in the framework of critical phenomena [126-128]. The observation of such shear
instabilities in complex turbulent flows affects our evaluation of mixing and dissipation in the
presence of rotation and stratification [129,130], with local values comparable to that of FDT. It
also leads for example to high (intermittent) vertical drafts in the mesosphere [131] (see [132]
for oceanic observations). This is occurring as well in the presence of magnetic fields, in which

case cross helicity plays a central role [133], as already elaborated in this review. This in fact can : =

Finally, detailed observations of magnetic helicity in solar flares have already allowed for the [3
