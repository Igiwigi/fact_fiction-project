This
paper deals with the minute microscopic changes upon which the permanent deforma-
tion of wood depends, and with the relationship between the microscopic structure
of wood and some of its more important mechanical properties. The work has
provided abundant material for a study of the structure of the walls of the cells of
which wood is composed. Considerable light has been thrown on the structure and
properties of the vegetable cell-wall in general, and it has been possible, from the
facts for wood, to frame a hypothesis which seems to explain satisfactorily most of the
properties of cell-walls. The examination of the mode of failure in timber, which has led to the work
described in this paper, was begun at the request of Lt.-Col. Jenkin, R.A.F. Iam
deeply indebted to him for the original suggestion of this line of work and for his
continued interest during its course.
