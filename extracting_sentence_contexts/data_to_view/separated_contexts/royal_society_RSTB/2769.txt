The slight differentiation of the sporophylls from the foliage leaves is a marked
feature in Ferns, and the same question arises here as in other Pteridophyta, as to
their relations. Such differences as do occur are readily recognised as due to
correlative growth, but, in addition to this, middle forms are common between the
two ;} and these, together with developmental evidence, support the just conclusion
that sterile leaves and sporophylls are truly comparable parts. There are those who
maintain that sporophylls are, from the point of view of descent, foliage leaves
altered by the addition of sporangia ; in fact, that the foliage leaf was the prior type,
and the sporangium an accessory. I find it impossible to harmonise this position
with the facts that sporangia are constant features in all normal Pteridophytes, and
that in all normal Archegoniates spore-production is an essential stage in the life-
history, The position which appears better to meet the facts for Ferns is, that the

* According to the views put forward above as to the relationships of the Ophioglossacew, they would
show an analogy only with the true Ferns, which, however, deserves notice. On the view that Ophioglossum
is the more primitive type, with its upright stock, and Helminthostachys a derivative, there would have
been a progression from the upright radial type to the dorsiventral of the same nature as is suggested for
various series of the true Ferns,
