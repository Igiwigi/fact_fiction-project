the alterations.

When the kathode rests on the nerve, the polar region being therefore kathodte, the
effect of mechanical excitation is increased ; when the anode rests on the nerve, the
polar region being therefore anodic, the effect of mechanical excitation is dominehed or
abolished.

On breaking the current the contractions appear in both cases greater than before.

A possible objection must be forestalled. Tt might be said that the increased effect
during the kathodie current, is partly due to the change of density in the current,
arising from the sudden compression of the tissues lying between the electrode and
the nerve. This is not consistent with the fact that such a change of density would
increase the” contractions when a strong polarising anode is applied, whereas the
contrary is observed. We may also remark that the effects are equally well observed
with a large additional resistance in circuit.

IV. PoLarR ALTERATIONS OF EXCITABILITY SUBSEQUENT TO THE PASSAGE OF THE
GALVANIC CURRENT, *

Preliminary.—Before drawing conclusions as to the state of excitability after the
passage of the galvanic current, it is necessary to realise the possible influence of
polarisation currents and alterations of resistance upon the current-strength.

* Tho after-effects have been alluded to by ome of the authors quoted aboye (EULENBURG, SAMT).
