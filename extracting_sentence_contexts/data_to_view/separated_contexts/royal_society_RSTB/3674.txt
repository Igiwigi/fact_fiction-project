At the upper end of the tractus pinealis some, at any rate, of the fibres of the
right pineal nerve enter the lower extremity of the pineal sac and spread out in the
nervous layer of the latter (fig. 60), just as the fibres of the left pineal nerve spread
out in the nervous layer of the retina of the pineal eye. It is possible that some of
the nerve-fibres may not enter the wall of the pineal sac immediately but spread out
first over the surface of the latter and enter it higher up. Some may perhaps join the
left pineal nerve, and this may account for the fact that the latter gives off branches to
the right pineal organ. These points, unfortunately, I have not been able to
determine for want of a method by which small bundles of non-medullated nerve-
fibres may be readily and with certainty distinguished from connective tissueâ€”a
difficulty which will be referred to again later on. At its lower end the fibres of the right pineal nerve enter the roof of the brain
just between the posterior and superior (habenular) commissures (figs.
