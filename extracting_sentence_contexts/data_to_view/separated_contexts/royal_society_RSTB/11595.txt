About 10 taxa seem to more frequently use purple loosestrife
as they are more abundant on this plant than the other insects. It was not possible to find references specifying the types
of leaf damage associated with certain insects. In fact, infor-
mation on the feeding activities of many generalist insects
which are not considered pests or nuisances is fragmentary. In addition, some insects cause more than one type of
damage depending on their developmental stage. Within
our list of phyllophagous insects feeding on purple loose-
strife, Coleopterans mainly cause hole feeding damage (65%
of the Coleopteran taxa in our list), whereas Lepidopterans,
which often cause more than one type of damage, are more
likely to yield margin or window feeding damage (64% of
the Lepidopteran taxa in our list).

(b) Historical reconstruction of herbivory pressure

The spatial distribution of purple loosestrife herbarium speci-
mens collected in Quebec covered the entire St Lawrence
River corridor, from Lake Saint-Frangois in the south to the
Magdalen Islands in eastern Quebec (figure 1).
