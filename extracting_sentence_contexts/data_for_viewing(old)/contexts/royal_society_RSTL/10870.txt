be obtained ; but it is probable that myohematin is much nearer to hazmoglobin than
to heematoporphyrin, and the above may be an accidental resemblance.

The Punction of the Tistohematins and Myohematin.

I need not repeat the results obtained by the action of oxidising and reducing
agents on these pigments, it will suffice to say that they are capable of oxidation and
reduction, and are hence respiratory. Jus as in Actinie—as I have shown in a former
paper,—actiniohzmatin is concerned in the respiration of the tissnes, 80 these pigments
are also concerned in it. They combine with the oxygen conveyed to them in the
blood, and hold it for purposes of metabolism, parting with the carbon dioxide in ex-
change for the oxygen. This is the only conclusion which anyone who has gone over
the 8ame ground can come to. These observations appear to me to point to the fact
that the formation of CO, and the absorption of oxygen takes place in the tissues
themselves (PrLUGeR and OERTMANN) and not in the blood. Hence these obser-

vations are of value in helping to decide a difficult point. T have not 8ucceeded yet
in finding out whether these pigments are dissolved in the plasma bathing the tissues,
or in the s0lid parts of the tissues. In the case of muscle, certainly a small amount of
