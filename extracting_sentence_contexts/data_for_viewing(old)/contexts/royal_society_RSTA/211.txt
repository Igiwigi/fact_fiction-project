orders of magnitude higher than previous experiments, being several thousands
of anti-atoms every few minutes (Amoretti et al. 2004). The author was part of
ATHENA at the time, and of its present successor, ALPHA. Thus, this article
will mostly focus on experience gained from these experiments.

The quest for antihydrogen is motivated by the current failure of physical
theories to completely describe the universe as we see it. There are a number
of fundamental problems in modern physics that remain to be addressed, and
for which CERN has also built the new Large Hadron Collider. An overarching
problem is that the theory of the very small, quantum mechanics, and the
theory of the very large, Einstein’s general relativity, are not fully compatible.
This means, for example, that we cannot achieve a complete, self-consistent,
description of black holes (Barcelé et al. 2009). In fact, we do not really know
if they truly exist in the form that Einstein’s theory predicts, as the extreme
conditions in some black holes require a quantum mechanical version of gravity,
which we do not have. But it is not only black holes that pose problems. Even
more extreme conditions existed in the early universe, directly after the Big
Bang. It is thought that conditions in the early universe provided the origin
of the current asymmetry between matter and antimatter. Antimatter is formed
when converting energy to matter. Such a conversion follows Einstein’s famous
equation, which states that E=mc?, where E is the energy, m is the mass
and c=300000kms~! is the speed of light in vacuum. When energy (in the
form of photons) is converted to matter, equal amounts of antimatter appear.
Thus, to make an electron, one needs at least twice the energy of a single
electron, as a positron is also necessarily made (in practice, more is needed
