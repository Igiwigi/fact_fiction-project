steps, providing insights into the molecular flux and selectivities [48].


3. Analysis of ionic transport through carbon nanotubes

Figure 4 compares the typical unprocessed current traces and the corresponding pore blocking
events from the stochastic transport of various cations (Lit, Na+ and K*) in isolated CNT
nanopores [8]. Herein, the baseline, unattenuated current is generated because of the transport
of the primary charge carriers (protons) in the electrolyte. Comparison of the traces (i) and (ii)
indicates the effect of ion concentration on the blocking events. Upon increasing the concentration
of Kt ions from 1 to 3 M, the frequency of the pore blocking increases as indicated by the
relative increase in the intensity of the histogram peak corresponding to the blocked state
(figure 4, trace ii). This relates to the fact that high concentration of potassium ions increases
their probability to find the nanopore entrance, and subsequently block the pore channel. Traces
(iii) and (iv) show the transport data for Lit ions at two different driving potentials across the
nanopore. Consistent with the prediction of equation (2.1), the pore blocking current increases
from 150 pA to 5 nA, when the driving potential is increased from 0.6 V to 3 V. Traces
(i)-(iv) exhibit only two states corresponding to the baseline current and the blockage current,
respectively. The presence of this two-state Coulter effect is the determining signature of single
nanopore transport. In the case of two parallel nanopores, three distinct states can be observed
(traces v and vi). In general, for n parallel nanopores with equivalent blocking currents, the
number of possible states is equal to (n+1). However, for an enormously large number of parallel
nanopores such as those in aligned CNT membranes [7], it is difficult to observe stochastic
blocking.
