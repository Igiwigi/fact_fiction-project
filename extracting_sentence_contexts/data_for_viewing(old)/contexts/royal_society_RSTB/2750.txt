with numerous degenerating follicles in the ovary, which, in the natural condition,
would no doubt have discharged at an earlier period, under the influence of the
increased stimulus of coition. A female ferret which I inseminated artificially during
cestrus did not become pregnant, owing, probably, to the presence of the sperms in
the uterus without the act of coition failing to induce ovulation.

Tn many bats ovulation is described as occurring at quite a different time of the
year from cestrus, copulation generally taking place in autumn and ovulation in
spring (VAN BENEDEN and JuLin, 1880), there being sometimes as long as six months
between them. â€˜The sperms are said to retain their vitality until the spring ovulation.

* The doe here referred to was a quarter-bred wild rabbit, and in colour and disposition resembled its
wild grandparent. It has occurred to me that this fact possibly may explain the occurrence of ovulation
in a virgin doe without the additional stimulus of coition, A wild rabbit may conceivably have greater
stimulating power at its disposal than one might expect to find evidence of in breeds that have long been

domesticated.
+ Donkeys are not referred to by Mr. Heapx in this connection, but artificial insemination has been
performed on donkeys to my knowledge, and has resulted in pregnancy.

It follows that in bats ovulation can occur without even the stimulus of cestrus,
unless the existence of the spermatozoa in the uterus may in some way provide a
