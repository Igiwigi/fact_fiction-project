play the expected cell-type regulation, indicating that HU/
HS/Col transcriptomics provide a reliable tool to monitor
gene modulations linked to the loss of neurogenesis.

(e) Epithelial expression of the NG and NT genes up-

regulated after loss of neurogenesis
To map the original cell type where the NG/NT genes up-
regulated after the loss of neurogenesis are expressed, we
performed cell-type-specific RNA-seq transcriptomics on
the epithelial ectodermal cells FACS-sorted from the Ecto-
GFP strain [29], epithelial endodermal cells FACS-sorted
from the Endo-GFP strain [30] and i-cells FACS-sorted from
the Cnnos1-GFP strain [31] (figure 52). To validate the results
of this approach, we compared the RNA-seq predictions to
the cell-type-specific expression patterns previously reported
by Hwang et al. [63], who identified a collection of i-cell,
nematoblast, nematocyte, nerve cell and gland cell-specific
genes. We first found that the Cnnos1-GFP transcriptome
appears to contain transcripts that are strictly expressed in
the i-cells, and is thus devoid of contamination (electronic
supplementary material, S5â€”S8).

By contrast, we found in the Endo-GFP transcriptome
transcripts that correspond to gland cell genes (electronic
