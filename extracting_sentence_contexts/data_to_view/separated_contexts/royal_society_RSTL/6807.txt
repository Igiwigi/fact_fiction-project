And of thoſe remains even of the marine
ſhells, yet unknown to us, all appear exotic to the
climes where they now lie depoſited ; e.g. the cliffs at
Harwich in Efſex abound with a ſpecies of buccinum
beteroſirophum, and other ſhells, never yet diſcovered
in the adjacent waters. The ammonite of ſo many
ſpecies, and the innumerable variety of conch
anemic, with which this ifland abounds, are yet un-
known to be inhabitants of our ſeas, and appear exotic
to this climate. Therefore, my Lord, I reaſonably
conclude partial or local deluges could never have

produced

produced ſuch effefts, However, unprejudiced to
any opinion, if the learned, who favour the ſyſtem
of partial deluges, will either confute theſs my aſ-
ſertions, or give ſolid reaſons for the facts alleged to
be producible by local deluges, atterrations, &0. I will
joyfully embrace the truth : but till then, my Lord,
would recommend to thoſe ſyſtematical gentlemen,
XZ not to pervert that excellent maxim of the great
