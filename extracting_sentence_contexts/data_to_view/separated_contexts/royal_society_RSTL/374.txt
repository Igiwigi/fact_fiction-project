BREWSTER 07 the multiplication of images, &c. 21

In this state of the subject, my attention was accidentally
directed to. it, in consequence of having received, from Sir
Grorct MACKENzZ1E, Bart., some very fine specimens of cal-
careous spar, which possessed the property of multiplying
and colouring the images. I examined with attention the
different planes in which the images were polarised ; I found
that 8mall crystals detached from particular parts of the spe-
cimens, possessed the 'same properties, and I represented in
figures the specimens which I employed, and the interrupt-
ing planes by which the colours were obviously produced. These results convinced me, that the interrupting plane was
not a fissure or fracture ; and I conjectured that the colours
were analogous to those produced by the action of crystals
upon polarised light.* By following out this conjecture, I have
been led to the true cause of all the phenomena, and of other
analogous facts ; and have thus been enabled to communicate
to any specimen of Iceland spar, the faculty of multiplying
and colouring the images, in a manner $0 exactly similar to
the real specimens, that no person can discern the least diffe-
rence between the phenomena of the artificial, and those of
the natural crystal. The results to which this explanation
leads, will, I trust, be equally interesting to the mineralogist
and to the natural philosopher. Seer.
