Then we can choose the remaining time-dependent control b(s) by solving
equation (5.26) for b(s) and setting &(s) = (1 â€” s + 5) (again compare equation (5.24) to equation
(5.19)). This, together with equation (5.25), fully defines the schedule. This mathematical model in fact describes a family of qubits, different by wg, pi(1) and 5. The family is spanned by varying the ratio Ey/Ec and B, in the region where both are >>1 to
ensure the applicability of equation (5.26) and the smallness of the precision parameter 5. Note
that in the Ej/Ec > 1 and B > 1 regime the aforementioned conditions wg < pl and wq < 4E La?
are automatically satisfied.
