â€˜The nasopalatine cartilage has been found in the calf by von
Mrmaxkovics (1899), and in the horse, pig, deer, sheep, ox, and rabbit, by Spureat
(1896). Itis not clear that by cartilago ductus nasopalatini some authors do not mean
the element which other authors call the palatine cartilage. When the former is
present, it is according to ArnBAck Curistte-LinpE (1914) always in continuity
with the anterior paraseptal cartilage, which fact raises doubts as to whether the
cartilago ductus nasopalatini has a real independence. It deserves further study,
and particularly in regard to the papillary cartilage which is present in some mammals. Recently, Jacopson (1928) has tried to show that in Talpa the palatine cartilage is
represented by the nodule of secondary cartilage in the palatine process of the maxilla.
