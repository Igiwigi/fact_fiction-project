For the longest time considered, 6-28 doubling-
periods, the point at which the abrupt fall begins lies outside the chart on the right. So far as the graphic test goes, accordingly, the theory gives very well indeed precisely
the form of distribution required. In Section IV the test of agreement between theory and fact on this point is completed
by fitting a calculated distribution to the actual distribution in four cases. To fit a
given distribution, we require to determine from it the two constants that determine
its form, the time + (in doubling-periods) elapsed since the commencement, and the
ratio p of the chance of a specific mutation to the chance of a generic mutation : we also
require the initial number Ny of primordial genera, which determines the total number
of genera existing.
