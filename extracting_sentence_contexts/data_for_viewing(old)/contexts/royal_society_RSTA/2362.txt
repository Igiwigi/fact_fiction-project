state while the latter is rotationally predissociated by the same b state, resulting in a pair of
ground-state atoms whose kinetic energy bears the imprint of the initial vibrational excitation

[28]. A last complication arises from the fact that the molecular ions themselves have a kinetic

energy that depends on the initial photodissociation event. Time-of-flight selection applied to

the centre of mass of the two hydrogen atoms allows for a complete reconstruction of the
stepwise fragmentation. Note that the same recipe does not apply to the vibrational analysis of

Hy) products.

(b) Experimental results

Kinetic energy release (KER) measurements have been performed under varying ion source
conditions, and over a wide range of laser intensities, in order to investigate the role of initial
