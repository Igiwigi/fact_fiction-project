The subject of the present issue of the Philosophical Trans-
actions of the Royal Society B is the ‘solid’ versus ‘liquid’ nature
of networks. I think that plants represent an interesting
‘hybrid’ between ‘solid’ and ‘liquid’. They are solid in the
sense that the agents and links have fixed positions in
space.” The fact that the death of a link is irreversible also
causes some rigidity in the behaviour of the system. But,
despite of these limitations, the system is quite flexible. The
agents are born and die unceasingly.
