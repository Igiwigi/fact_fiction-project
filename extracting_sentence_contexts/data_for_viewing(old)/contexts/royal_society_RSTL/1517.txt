afforded by the varieties of Bovey coal, yet these, as well as
the alder leaves, and also a coal like that of Bovey, found in
Sussex, at Newick Park, (an estate belonging to Sir Elia
Inrey,) and also the surturbrand of Iceland, yielded ome
resin, which at Bovey is likewise found in distinct masses,
intermixed with the strata of coal, and combined with as-
phaltum, in the proportion of about 4,1 parts of the latter with
53 of resin.*

Now, exclusive of the other vegetable characters which are
80 evident in many of the varieties of Bovey coal, of the
Sussex coal, of surturbrand, &c. &c. the presence of resin must
be regarded as a strong fact; for this substance has always
been attributed to the organized bodies, particularly to those
of the vegetable kingdom, and I do not know of any instance,
previous to my own experiments, in which, resin had been
discovered as constituting part of any of the different species
and varieties of coal.

From the external vegetable characters possessed by the
Bovey coal, the Sussex coal, the surturbrand, and many
others, together with the resin, (allowed to be exclusively a
vegetable substance, or at least one which only appertains to
the organized natural bodies,) there cannot be -any doubt,
that such coals have been formed from wood and other sub-
