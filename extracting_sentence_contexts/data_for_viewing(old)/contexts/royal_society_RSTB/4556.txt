horizontal resin-canals of the wood named by PENHALLOw Pityorylon chasense (from
the Permian of Kansas) are really the persistent leaf-traces of a Dadoxylon devoid of
annual rings. The other wood, Pinites Conwentzianus, Goepp., the Abietineous nature
of which Prof. Sewarp has confirmed by an examination of the original sections, was
believed by Gorprerr to be of Carboniferous age. The fossil was, however, found
on a rubbish-heap, so that its correct age is extremely doubtful, and Prof. Sewarp
has recently obtained further confirmation of this doubt (Sewarp, 1919, p. 220).

Both from the structural and from the historical side, the balance of evidence is at
present decidedly in favour of the Araucarinee being the more primitive group, and
the resemblances which the latter group shows to the Cordaitales (BURLINGAME, 1915)
are in accord with the view that they are more primitive than the Abietinem. |
However, the facts at our disposal do not appear definitely to indicate that the one
group is necessarily derived from the other. An independent origin from a common,
source is, at any rate, a safe hypothesis.

(b) Fossil Podocurpinee.—Unfortunately, the fossil history of the Podocarpineex—
the family with which we are here more intimately concerned—is very imperfectly
known. ‘This is probably because, as BurtincaME has hinted (1908, p. 175), “ we
know but little of the plant-remains of those parts of the world in which their
remains would be most likely to be found.” The probability of a relation with the

Araucarians justifies the hope that undoubted Podocarpinee may be discovered in
the Mesozoic rocks, but it is for the future to show whether this group can at all
rival in age the Araucarinez.
