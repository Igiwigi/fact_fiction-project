rest of the plant remained normal. The sap of leaves from the upper portion of this
plant on the day of grafting was tested for X” or other strain with negative result.
This, however, must not be taken as evidence that X” was absent from all other parts of
the plant. When a month later a scion from the affected portion of this plant was put to
President, the iatter developed an interveinal mosaic and not the typical interveinal
necrosis. Exactly the same occurred in those cases where X* infected Eclipse had been
grafted to President. The sprouts of tubers from all the inoculated and grafted Up-to-
date plants were examined in the following year and were found to contain X” but no
X%, There seems good reason to believe that the Up-to-date at the time of grafting was
infected with X”, but that the virus had not attained a footing in the young apical
growth. Lower down the tissues were sufficiently impregnated with the masked strain
to withstand any aggression on the part of the X* which had gained a foothold in its
younger apical portion. The explanation of the fact that such infected portions,
whether in Up-to-date or Eclipse, when grafted back to President and Arran Victory,
produce only an interveinal mottle and not the normal X* reaction, would seem to be

164 R. N. SALAMAN ON THE POTATO VIRUS “X”:

as follows: The scion which showed evidence of X” is, by the time it is removed from
the mother plant, also rich in X”; the sap which passes into the healthy stock contains
therefore a mixture of strains and as such does not produce the characteristic necrotic
symptoms of X* but a simple mottle. In tobaccos we have found in hundreds of cases
