intersects the earth’s surface in England reaches its highest point. The wave packet is in this
case unable to escape from the ionosphere but will be guided along the line of force right
up to that point. It then continues down the line of force in the other hemisphere and
arrives at the earth as a dispersed wave train which is recognized as a whistler. The
mechanisms discussed above prevent undue spreading of the waves, so that their intensity
at the point where they return to the ground is considerable.

It is suggested that the short whistlers heard in Cambridge originate in lightning flashes
which occur at the opposite end of a line of magnetic force, somewhere in the southern
hemisphere. The clicks corresponding to the direct radiation which travels in the space
between the ground and the ionosphere, following the curve of the earth, are heavily
attenuated even at night time, and so are too weak to be detected (Budden 1951). ‘This
accounts for the fact that short whistlers are not preceded by clicks.

It is also suggested that long whistlers are heard in Cambridge when waves originating
ina local lightning flash travel along the magnetic lines of force and are reflected back again
after reaching the earth at the other end. The process responsible for the concentration of
