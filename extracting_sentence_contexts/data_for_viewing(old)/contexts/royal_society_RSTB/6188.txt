the subjacent macule. We shall here briefly record our inferences as to the
physical happenings connected with their second form of receptor activity.

When a frog is tilted through a certain angle on the tilt-table, its head describes
an arc of a circle. The farther the head is distant from the axis of rotation, the
longer is this arc. Theoretically, a rapid arc displacement of the head gives a
possibility of relative translatory movement of the otolith upon its macula, which
might conceivably constitute the effective stimulus. So far as ready elicitation of
this reflex goes, one finds, however, that it is a matter of indifference whether the
rapidly tilted animal is near or far away from the axis. Moreover, whether the
frog (with a certain compass direction) sits on this side or on that side of the axis, it
always responds in the same way. These facts of themselves practically dispose of
the supposition that effective stimulation involves a translatory displacement of the
otoliths.

In order to eliminate the possibility of any otolithic translatory movement, we
constructed a special underhung type of tilt-table, in which the table-top is 2 cm
below the axis of rotation. This distance is about the usual height of the frogâ€™s
labyrinths from the ground. When the animal, sitting with its two labyrinths in this
axis, is now quickly tilted either forwards or backwards, it reacts as readily as before.
Similarly, if it sits with its body parallel to, and with its head in the axis, it is just
as responsive to quick lateral tilt. The only possible conclusion from this experiment
is that the utricular apparatus responds in some way to rotation as such.
