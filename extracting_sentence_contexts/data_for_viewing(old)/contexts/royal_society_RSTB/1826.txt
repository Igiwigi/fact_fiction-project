closely into the details of these extraordinary abnormalities, but I shall endeavour
first to give a plain statement of the facts, without reference to opinions which may
be based upon them.

It is at the period when the difference in character of the tapetal and sporogenous
cells becomes clearly marked, both by form and contents, that these anomalies, of
which in early stages it is difficult to be sure, may be studied with some degree of
certainty. The sporogenous tissue does not appear to be always strictly limited to
so regular groups of cells as those previously described : thus in fig. 21, a packet of
cells, evidently the result of subdivision of one, projects beyond the neighbouring
group, though it shares their characters ; this case, which is uncommon, was veritied
by comparing the whole series of microtome sections through that loculus, and there
is no doubt of the fact. We may compare this with what has been described in
Isoetes in a former Memoir (‘ Phil. Trans.’ B, 1894 p. 531, figs. 106-108), and
oceasionally in some other plants. A much more common irregularity is the converse :
viz., that certain cells, often clearly sister-cells with those of the sporogenous group,
remain sterile, and develop as tapetum, or it may be as permanent tissue of a septum.
Examples of this are seen in figs. 22, 23, in which the cells (st) are clearly sister-cells
with those of the sporogenous group, though they develop differently, showing already
by the cessation of division, and by the poverty of their protoplasm, that whey will
be sterile ; there is thus a partial sterilisation of the sporogenous group in certain
cases.

Another feature, not to be confused with this, though producing similar results, is
the encroachment of some of the tapetal cells upon the sporogenous mass ; this is well
