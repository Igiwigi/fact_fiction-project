Sterilisation. The sterilisation of potentially sporogenous cells, that is, the conversion of cells
of common origin with sporogenous cells, and which in other cases, or under
other circumstances would form spores, into vegetative cells, is an essential feature
in the antithetic theory. It is a fact illustrated in the sporophyte of the most
various plants. * It should, however, be pointed out at once that the facts of
sterilisation are compatible with either of the above views as to the origin of
the sporophyte; the difference between the two views lies in the extent to which
it is held that sterilisation has been operative in the past.
