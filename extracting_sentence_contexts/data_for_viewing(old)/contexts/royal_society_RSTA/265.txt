UCL was quick to develop, and very considerable progress was made in fundamental
research.

Van der Heijden [1] emphasizes that ‘Michael has been a member of UCL’s Civil Engineering
Department for 38 years. He is best known as the Founder/Director of the Centre for Nonlinear
Dynamics and its Applications. The Centre was set up in 1991 and quickly became an
internationally renowned centre for interdisciplinary research in nonlinear dynamics’.

During his period at Cambridge and then UCL, Michael published a series of papers on
general theory of elastic stability [3-22] and developed—largely independently of another giant of
modern mechanics, Warner Tjardus Koiter (1914-1997)—the theory of imperfection sensitivity of
structures. Michael had been unaware of Koiter’s PhD thesis [23], published in Dutch in 1945. In
his ‘Advice to a young researcher’ [24], he reminisces: ‘it was, in fact, when I submitted my paper
on the basic principles of elastic stability [7] in 1963 to Rodney Hill at Nottingham that he drew
my attention, for the first time, to the work of Koiter...’. These researches, both in solo papers
and in collaboration with associates, culminated in a monograph [25] together with his former
student Giles Hunt, who later became a long-term collaborator. In its preface Michael wrote

For several years the first author was blissfully unaware of the classic dissertation of Prof.
W. T. Koiter which had surprisingly lain largely unknown since 1945 and has in fact only
recently been translated into English by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of
America. This was indeed most fortunate since the weight of Prof. Koiter’s contribution
could well have discouraged him from proceeding with his own development of the
subject. As it transpired, the full significance of Prof. Koiter’s work has filtered slowly
into our consciousness in a gentle stream, moderated by the Dutch language and by our
