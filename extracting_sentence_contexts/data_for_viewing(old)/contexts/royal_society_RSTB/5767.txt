mycetin as isolated from the metabolism solution. 64 gm. of crude citromycetin gave
31 gm. of pure methyl ester.

This compound (0-dimethylcitromycetin methyl ester) is also produced when citro-
mycetin is methylated by treatment with diazomethane in ether solution.

The methyl ester crystallises in white silky needles having a melting point of 178° C.
without decomposition. It is readily soluble in hot absolute or 50 per cent. alcohol but
is almost insoluble in the cold. It is insoluble in aqueous solutions of potassium acetate,
potassium bicarbonate or even of potassium hydroxide. Its alcoholic solution gives no
colour with ferric chloride.

In view of the fact that this compound is very stable and can be readily purified by
crystallisation, a sample was sent to Scorer (Berlin) for analysis in order to obtain
external confirmation of the empirical formula for citromycetin suggested by our own
combustion results on this material.

The sample analysed was dried to constant weight over P,O; in vacuo and gave the
following results :—
