that is, to the two-thirds power of the volume of each drop, or for a given ex-
pansion to 1/n** where n is the number per cubic centimetre. The time, t, taken to
fall a given distance is thus proportional to n**, or the number of drops is proportional
to ®. Now, when »v,/v, exceeds 1°35 the times taken by the drops on the two sides
to fall a given distance certainly do not differ by as much as 1 part in 10. If
t/t, = 1°1 then n,/n,= 11° =1:15. Thus the number of ions is the same on the
two sides to within 15 per cent.

The equality of the fogs on the two sides is, in fact, rather more exact than we
would expect ; for the positive ions, according to ZELENY, take 1°25 times as long as
the negative to travel a given distance. We would expect then (the strength of the
field on each side being the same) that, if equal numbers of positive and negative
ions were produced in a given time, the negative ions would be more quickly removed,
and a somewhat larger number of drops should have been produced in the half
containing mainly positive ions.

The absence of any indication of this slight excess of positive ions is of the less
consequence for the present purpose, since it strengthens rather than weakens the
evidence against the view that a larger number of positive than of negative ions is
produced. As a test of the trustworthiness of the method for detecting a difference
in the number of drops produced on the two sides, experiments were made in which
