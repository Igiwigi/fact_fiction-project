These experiments, therefore, bear out, in a striking and satisfactory manner the
results of those in which carbonic oxide was made to act upon blood which had been
treated with nitrites. The latter experiments showed that carbonic oxide had lost its power of thrusting out
oxygen, although from certain facts which had been previously described, it appeared
that the oxygen of the blood is neither expelled nor permanently taken possession of
by nitrites. The fact that the loose oxygen which can be thrast out by CO is identical with the
oxygen which is given up by blood # vacuo, led me to suppose that bodies which, as
nitrites, have the power of locking up the loose oxygen of hzmoglobin and preyenting
its expulsion by CO, would likewise prevent its removal by the air-pump. The hypo-
thesis has proved to be a correct one. I must now make a few remarks upon the use of SPRENGEL's mercurial aspirator in
the extraction of the gases of the blood.
