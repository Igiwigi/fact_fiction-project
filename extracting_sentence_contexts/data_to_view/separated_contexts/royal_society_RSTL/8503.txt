Then, by considering the space outside the surface S, or sy
between this surface and infinity, and observing that U does not become infinite for any
point in this space, we haye

(z...2,w) on the surface, and we have at the surface W'=W", =W 8uppose; the

term on the right-hand side thus is (w(9+%) dS, which vanishes in virtue of
