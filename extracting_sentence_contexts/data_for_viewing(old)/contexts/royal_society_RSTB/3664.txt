weighing 5 lbs. 9 oz. It has the characteristic beak, dorsal keel (shaped by six
well-marked longitudinal flakings), and a flat ventral surface. It is broader and
heavier than any of the Icenian “eagle’s beaks.” Little of the original cortex is left ;
the worked surface is nearly black, scratched here and there by glacial action and a
little stained by iron. The edges of fracture are smooth to the touch, not sharp.
Another specimen is a very large flint hammer-stone, of the shape of a four-sided
pyramid, closely similar to that from Suffolk drawn in figs. 25 and 26 of the
preceding memoir. But the Selsea specimen is of twice the linear dimensions of
that from Suffolk. Other specimens of a less decisive character have been found.
A very striking feature about the two specimens mentioned is their great size and
weight. I hope to publish figures of the Selsea Bill specimens at no distant date.

The second newly ascertained fact which I desire to put on record in this
connection is the existence of rostro-carinate implements—very similar to those
of the Icenian industry—in the remarkable deposit of fractured nodules and slabs of

chert, discovered by Rames in 1877 near Aurillac in the Auvergne. Mr, Epwarp
WestLake, of Fordingham, near Salisbury, has devoted several years to the
collection and study on the spot of the humanly-worked chert-stones of Aurillac, and
(for the purpose of comparing the two industries) to the investigation of the stone
implements of the Tasmanians, having spent some months in Tasmania for this
purpose. I have during this winter (1912) been able, by Mr. WestiaKe’s kindness,
