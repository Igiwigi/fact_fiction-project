The most striking result, however, among these general considerations was the
difference in effect obtained by excitation with the same stimulus, and under precisely
the same conditions, and within a few seconds of each other, of the peripheral end of
the anterior and the central end of the posterior root respectively. It was then found that, whereas stimulation of the central end of the posterior
root gave flexion of the whole limb, excitation of the peripheral end of the corre-
sponding anterior root gave extension of the whole limb, Of course throughout
these experiments there has been no excitation of the cerebral end of the anterior root,
except when the nerve was stimulated in continuity. Besides the fact that the whole
doctrine of recurrent sensibility, as originally formulated by Masenpin, Bernarp,
and others, does not find much support at the present time, there is also the direct
experimental evidence of Gorcu and Horsiey io show that stimulation of the
cerebral end of the anterior root has no appreciable physiological effect on either the
centres or channels in the spinal cord (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ B, 1891), for these observers
found that, whereas excitation of the central end of the posterior root gave maximal
evidences of change in the electrical state of the spinal cord, on the other hand
excitation of the central end of the anterior root not only produced no effect in the
state of the spinal cord, but even stimulation of the central end of the whole of the
anterior roots represented in the sciatic nerve gave, when the corresponding posterior
roots were cut, no resulting change in the spinal cord whatever. This remarkable functional distinction between the roots (viz., anterior, extension ;
posterior, flexion) was quite constant, and was obtained in every animal in which the
experiment was made.
