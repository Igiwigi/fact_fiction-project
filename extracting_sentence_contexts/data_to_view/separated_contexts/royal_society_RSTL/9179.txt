degrees of viscosity, jusb as the previous figures exhibited = The calculations were

done in the game way as before, after the various functions of the obliquity were
expressed in terms of cos 27 and cos 49. The only remarkable point in these curves is that, for the higher degrees of
viscosity, the tidal friction rises to a maximum for about 45® of obliquity. The tidal
friction rises to its greatest value when e=22FZ* nearly ; this is explained by the fact
bhat by far the largest part of the friction arises from the gemi-diurnal tide, which has
its greatesb effect when sin 4c is unity.

that of there being any kind of lagging tides.
