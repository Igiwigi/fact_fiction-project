§11. The properties of the determinants (8) may be used to obtain some idea of the
nature of functions of positive type. Let us suppose, in the first place, that there is
a point (a, a) belonging to Q at which one of these functions «(s,¢) vanishes. The

determinant (® a evidently reduces to —[k(s,a)[; hence, because it can never

be negative,

K (8, %) = k(m%, s) = 0.

In other words, if we draw the square Q and the diagonal s = ¢, the existence of a
point (%, %) on this diagonal at which «(s, ¢) vanishes involves the fact that «(s, ¢)
vanishes everywhere on the lines drawn through this point parallel to the axes of s
and ¢. In particular, we deduce from this that @ function «(s, t) which is of positive
type, and is not zero everywhere in Q, cannot vanish everywhere on the diagonal s = t.

More generally, let us suppose that there are points %, %, ..., % of the interval

(a, 6) such that
