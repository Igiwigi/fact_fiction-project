the stele is interrupted. The phloem cannot be definitely recognised as such. ‘Two
or three layers of thin-walled cells form a dark sheath (? endodermis) to the whole stele,
and this sheath bulges out in front of the emerging lateral organ (see fig. 50). The
marked thickening of the sheath on the opposite side is possibly related to the recent
exit of an appendage.

The cortex, except for indications of a periderm on one side (fig. 50, Plate 6), is
very similar in appearance and structure to that of the surrounding Clepsydropsis
roots. ‘There are the same three zones, of which the middle one is prominent as a narrow
dark band; scattered in the inner cortex are the same dark-coloured cells as in
Clepsydropsis.

These facts suggest that the organ may after all be a large Clepsydropsis root with
secondary growth—a parent root to many others given off distichously, as hinted
above. But if this be so it is strange that among the numerous roots examined there
is not one which shows a trace of periderm or secondary wood. No root-hairs are
seen, but this may be because the organ is packed among the surrounding roots. On
the other hand, there is the possibility that the organ in question belongs to some
delicate plant which grew as an epiphyte on the false stem, somewhat like Ankyropteris
scandens on a Permian Psaronius, or Tmesipteris, Trichomanes and other delicate plants
on the trunks of modern tree-ferns.

In the absence of further data it is impossible to express an opinion as to the nature
of the organ. Comparison with such diverse objects as Botrychioxylon paradoxum*
and the root of Sphenophyllum} were tried, but the evidence is insufficient. It is
