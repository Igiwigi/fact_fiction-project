The second curse has been computing power. It has become nearly trivial to estimate more or
less any mildly identified model that one can write down, and hence there has been an explosion
of terms on the right-hand side. The result is not only thousands of incomparable ‘models’ that
really are bereft of any strong interpretation, but a mistaken vision of science as progressing
by increasing the number of concrete determinants—as if Galileo could be criticized for only
thinking about point masses, and not also including balloons, feathers and magnets when he did
his (fictional) experiments [49]. This has led us to prefer models that seem to possess realism,
but interfere with our capacity to understand more elegant, and more theoretically generative,
simplifications that might speak to the nature of distributions. Consider the theoretical clarification that came after Quetelet’s development of the statistics
for social phenomena.
