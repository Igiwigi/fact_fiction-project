Now it is probable that some of
the hosts containing young parasites killed by inclement weather are suitable for further
parasite development in the succeeding spring, and in the field these are the only
hosts which the parasite is likely to encounter, which are perfectly good for develop-
ment of progeny, and yet contain a dead parasite. The laboratory experiments show
the limitations of the adaptive behaviour of the female. It remains a fact that the
overwhelming percentage of the hosts available at any given time are live hosts, some
perhaps containing live parasites, some perhaps dead parasites, and the oviposition
response of the Ovencyrtus is such that she generally chooses the best of those hosts. Again, the criteria used are not certain to be those of suitability, but, for the usual or
most probable course of events, they are. A similar interpretation can be applied to the behaviour of the polyphagous T7richo-
gramma evanescens, which is so occupied with size or quantity in selecting hosts, that in
the laboratory the females choose large hosts unsuitable for the development of their
progeny (or even large false hosts in which no progeny can be deposited) although the
normal small host, Sifotroga, is present.
