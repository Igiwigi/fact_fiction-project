For CER NS 24:0, the peaks at the head groups are further apart (z ~ +2.5nm)
and broader, reflecting the slithering motion of the tails. The liquid-like overlap region shows
much larger electron density in the bilayer midplane than CER NS 16:0. The constant density
regions of both CER NS 16:0 and CER NS 24:0 bilayers have the same density and width,
reflecting the fact that the ordered region is determined by the sphingosine tails of the same
length shared between the two species. Figure 2d shows the lipid mass density (symbols) in a
mixed bilayer comprising a 1:2:1 molar ratio of CER NS 22:0, 24:0 and 26:0. The densities
from individual components show that the shorter-tailed CER NS 22:0 (solid line) has a dip in
