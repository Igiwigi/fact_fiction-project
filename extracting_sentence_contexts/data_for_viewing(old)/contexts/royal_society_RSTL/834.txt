eastward as the isJand Sabedei, he relinquished the farther
prosecution of the attempt by sea; at the very season, in fact,
which was the most proper that could have been chosen for
his outset from the Kolyma.* In this short attempt, Com-
modore BiLLiNGs did not even get sight of the north land ;
but an approach to it was to be-inferred from the soundings.
The snow and ice were at this time rapidly dissolving, $0 as

direction ; and during that time, the water on the surface of
the sea was 80 fresh as to be used for cooking, and some-
times for drinking.

Afterwards, Commodore B1LLiNGs, with the consent of the
Tschuktzki people, made a progress by land along a part of
