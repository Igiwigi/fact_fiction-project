length is necessary for the lubricant molecule before the adsorbed lubricating layer
can afford appreciable protection to the surfaces. This condition seems to be attained
at caproic acid (C;H,,;COOH). At this point continuous sliding sets in and at the
same time the minimum value of the friction is reached. The corrosive properties were
found to diminish as the chain length increases and also become very small above
caproic acid.

It has been shown that, in the liquid state, alcohols and hydrocarbons are unable
to prevent stick-slips and do not afford much protection to the surfaces. Their be-
haviour is, in fact, essentially similar to that shown by mineral oils. The molecules of
these substances must therefore be attached to the surface comparatively weakly so
that the film of lubricant is easily broken down by the applied load. This view is
supported by the fact that the addition of a trace of cetyl alcohol was ineffective in
changing the nature of the sliding of a mineral oil. In contrast to the behaviour of a

fatty acid, this substance is unable to form a very protective adsorbed layer on the
surface.

When an alcohol or a hydrocarbon is present on the surface in the solid state,
however, continuous sliding does occur. This effect is probably mechanical and is due
to the comparatively thick films of solid present on the two surfaces gliding over one
another.
