Close to the solar limb, on both sides of the photograph, bright lines are geen which
evidently belong to the prominences. On the northern limb these are most numerous
and brightest. It seems certain, in fact, from a comparison with the photograph
obtained in the prismatic camera, that the slib must have crossed the prominence 3,
which, as has already been mentioned, was rich in ultra-violet light. On the same
plate above and below, the solar spectrum had been photographed after the eclipse,
and we had, therefore, no difficulty in identifying the principal lines. We see in the
first place the calcium lines H and K.
