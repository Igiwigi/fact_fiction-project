In all observations of extinction, the greatest care must be taken to obtain the
most sensitive condition of the eye, and I have found that it is useless to attempt any
readings until the eye has been placed in darkness for at least twelve minutes. It is
well to vary the plan of reading by first reducing the light till it disappears, and then
to note the exact point when it reappears. The latter would be the best plan to use
entirely, since the eye is in darkness till the very last part of the observation, were it
not for the fact that, in noting the reappearance of the light, we are noting something
less defined than when we are noting its disappearance. The combination of the two
methods has been found to be the most satisfactory plan. A very great difficulty
also often arises in keeping the axis of the eye employed in a line with the object
observed, particularly when it is of very small angular aperture.
