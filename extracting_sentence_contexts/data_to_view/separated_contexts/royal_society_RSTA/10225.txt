At an average extra-
tropical station, according to HANN, this latter figure is reduced to 0°54 C. Allowing
tentatively a corresponding reduction on the 0°55 C., it becomes 0°41 C, Thus the
differences recorded in Table XX. are not merely of the normal sign, but even of
somewhat the same order of magnitude as they should be according to Hann at an
average extra-tropical station on the average of a number of sun-spot periods. The fact that in Table XX. a rise in the mean annual temperature is associated
with a diminution in the mean daily range may be accidental, but is possibly worth
fuller investigation.

§ 19. Table XXI. shows the variation throughout the year at Falmouth in the
mean vapour-pressure for the 24 hours, in the daily range of temperature, and in the
amplitudes of the 24-hour and 12-hour terms in the diurnal inequality of temperature. Taste XXI.—Monthly Relative Values (100 = mean from 12 months).
