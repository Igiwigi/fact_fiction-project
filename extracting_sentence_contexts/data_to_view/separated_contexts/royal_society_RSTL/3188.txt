These experiments were repeated with success, both in the platina crucible and
in the platina gilt crucible ; and precisely similar results were obtained with
coffee, under like treatment. It is proper to remark, that the experiments noticed in this section, were, in
general, carried on only for a few minutes, s0 that the decompositions were
mostly partial, and probably in-no instance complete. This statement is con-
firmed by facts, for I repeatedly found that after a given effect had taken place
in the platina' crucible in a few minutes, a still further effect was s00n pro-
duced, by transferring the same materials to the platina gilt crucible. MDCCOXXXI, Y

When a solution of corrosive sublimate (in small quantity) was added to
some s$herry or port wine in a platina crucible, and the zinc applied, a beau-
tiful effect gradually took place.
