H(yj) = Hajj) —€/2 and H(wj) = H(bjw;) — €/2,
because limj[H(ajuj) — H(yj)] = 0. Thus for large j, h. + 5 > H(ajyj) + H(bjwj) = ly + Thy, whence
h>ly+h-y.

However, similar to the classical case, the map 4 — I) is strictly subadditive. In fact, we have the
following lemma to that effect. Once lemma 2.2 is established, a contradiction is reached and we
will have shown that splitting cannot occur.

Lemma 2.2. The map 4 — I, is strictly subadditive, i.e. Ih, <1, + I,-y,Vy € (0,4).

Proof. Note for every 6 > 1,
