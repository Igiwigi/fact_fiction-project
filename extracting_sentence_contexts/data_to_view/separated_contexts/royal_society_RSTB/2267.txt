This has added greatly to the
labour of the research, but has been absolutely necessary for the purposes of micro-
meter measurement. If the posterior portion of a hemisphere be cut into coronal
sections, it at once becomes evident how remarkably few regions are at right angles
to the course of the convolutions. In fact almost the only micrometer measurements
which could be obtained would be taken from the flat external surfaces or the
bottoms of the fissures. Case 2.
