S From the five generations of cultures, the conclusion may be drawn that the F, of
2 Oe. ammophila x (biennis X rubricalyx) called B' breeds true in many families, but
= splits in some F, families into twin types which agree in their main features with the F,
S types from the reciprocal, although the F, generations are so different. When the A
iz and B types are crossed, they segregate into the parental types in F,. The most
ia striking fact concerning these triple hybrids is thus that they give rise to twin types
= which breed true in the main. The B type may also segregate the A type, but not
i] vice versa. These and similar true-breeding hybrids in Oenothera appear to be
EE explained in part by the linkage of their chromosomes during meiosis, to be described
g in the next section.
