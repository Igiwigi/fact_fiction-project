There is abundant evidence from
gent property of the animalsâ€™ abilities to maintain and both developmental psychology [136] and neuroimaging [137]
coordinate social relationships [40]. This is evident from the that, in humans, this actually takes a very long time (possibly
fact that neocortex volume correlates with a number of behav- as long as two decades). The fact that, in primates, neocortex
ioural indices of social complexity in primates, including the volume is best predicted by the length of the socialization
size of grooming cliques [13,120], the use of coalitions [6], the period (weaning to first reproduction), and not by the period
use of sophisticated social strategies [121] and the frequency of parental investment (gestation plus lactation) that conven-
of tactical deception [81]. Importantly, there is direct evidence tionally explains total brain size [134], reinforces this point. It
that individual differences in social skills have real implications is not enough to have a big computer; the computer needs soft-
for fitness [121-125].
