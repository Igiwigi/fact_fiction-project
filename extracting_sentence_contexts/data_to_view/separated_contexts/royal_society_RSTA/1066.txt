The


energy levels corresponding to stationary states and the transitions between these levels could
be observed, as registered in measuring instruments. By contrast, orbits were merely assumed,
rather than ever observed in the way we would observe the orbits of planet around the Sun. This
fact played a role in Heisenberg’s thinking [7], which abandoned the orbital or any representation
of stationary states, while retaining Bohr’s concept of discrete transitions between quantum states
without representing them either and, thus, renouncing at least a representational realism in QM. As he said: ‘What I really like in this scheme is that one can really reduce all interactions between
atoms and the external world ... to transition probabilities’, without assuming either realism or
causality in considering these transitions (W. Heisenberg, Letter to R.
