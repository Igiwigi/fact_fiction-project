out that that animal is secondarily aquatic and that its expanded clavicles are related
to the mode of life ; with this conclusion I am in perfect agreement.


EVOLUTION, AND ORIGIN OF THE AMPHIBIA. 61

The only direct evidence that the wide triangular clavicles which are so noticeable
a feature of Triassic Stereospondyls have been derived from narrow clavicles like
those of Reptiles is derived from the family Brachyopide, where the Upper Permian
Dwinasaurus, the oldest known member of the family, has quite narrow clavicles like
those of Eryops, whilst in the Upper Triassic Plagiosaurus and Plagiosternum the
clayicles are extremely widened. Additional evidence in support of this view is
afforded by the fact that narrow clavicles are very common in Lower Permian
Rachitomous forms, whilst no Triassic Stereospondyl is known which has not large
widely expanded clavicles.

It might, in the absence of Dwinasaurus, have been argued that after all the wide
type is the primitive one, and that from it Eryops, ete., were derived as short-lived
side branches.

This view, however, will not meet the case ; the clavicles described by Hancock and
Arriry (19) which belong to Pteroplax are totally different from those of Eryops and
the expanded type of Metoposaurus, and certainly represent the primitive, primarily
aquatic, large amphibian type. I propose to discuss these bones and the methods and
causes of the origin of the Eryops clavicle from them in a later paper.
