We do not, however,
admit that a simple type of male prothallus such as occurs in Sequoia, Taxodium and
Torreya necessarily constitutes an important criterion in estimating the relative
positions of genera in a natural system of classification. If Conifers had their
ancestry among Filicinean plants, we might reasonably expect to find in the more
primitive and older genera a closer approach to a less highly specialised type of
microspore. Miss Roserson,|| in her valuable contribution to our knowledge of the
genus Torreya, has referred to this point and, as a means of reconciling facts not in
accord with reasonable expectation, she has suggested an explanation which is
