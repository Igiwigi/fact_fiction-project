One other important predictor of variations in reading devel-
opment is RAN. RAN tasks require a child to name as
quickly as they can a list of pictures, colours, letters or num-
bers. Children with dyslexia perform poorly on RAN [26],
and in unselected samples of children, there are reliable con-
current and longitudinal correlations between RAN and
childrenâ€™s reading skills (see [27,28], for reviews). The fact
that even RAN for pictures and colours, measured before
children can read, is predictive of later variations in reading
skills [21] indicates that this effect cannot just be a conse-
quence of differences in LK. The fact that RAN predicts
reading accuracy as well as fluency suggest that this effect
does not simply reflect general variations in speed of proces-
sing. Furthermore, whatever RAN taps, it is statistically
independent of LK and PA as a predictor of decoding skill.
However, we would emphasize that there is no evidence
from a training study to clinch the argument that RAN
plays a causal role in constraining the rate of reading develop-
ment; on the contrary, training in rapid letter naming appears
