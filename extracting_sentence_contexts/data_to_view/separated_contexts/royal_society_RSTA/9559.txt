Velocity measurements were made while the mercury was in motion. The tap T was
adjusted so that the mercury overflowed at C at the rate of about 3 ¢.c. per second,
On considering this, together with the dimensions of the dish, it is clear that no part
of the surface exists for more than a small fraction of a second. Owing to the fact
that the mercury in D was soon exhausted, accurate measurements could not be made. However, it can be said that the maximum emission velocity from the continuously
forming mercury surface was 2°15+°05 volts. This is practically the same value as
that obtained for distilled Zn, Cd, and Hg.
