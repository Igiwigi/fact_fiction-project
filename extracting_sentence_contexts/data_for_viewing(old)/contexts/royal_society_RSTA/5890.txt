from [14], which enjoys uniform-in-time bounds on the first-order derivatives and decreases the


negative norms of a specific advected scalar exponentially in time. By interpolation, the positive
norms of the scalar increase exponentially in time, and roughly speaking the iterative construction
entails a rescaling in time that makes the exponential increase an instantaneous blow up, still
keeping under control the W!? norm of the vector field for every p < oo. By contrast, in the present
proof, we rely on the velocity field constructed in §2, which increases the H! norm of the advected
scalar exponentially in time, but in general, it is not mixing. The advantage of this approach is that
higher regularity norms of the velocity field are controlled uniformly in time, and that the growth
of the Sobolev norm holds for every (non-trivial) advected scalar with initial data in H!. We will
therefore be able to keep under control higher W"? norms of the vector field uniformly in time,
and to show loss of H! regularity for every such initial data. In fact, since the construction is local,
we need only assume that the initial data is locally in HR’).

The iterative construction becomes however less explicit, since the location and the spatial
scale of the family of cubes depend on the initial data, as we need to select the cubes in such a
way that the derivative of the initial data is large enough in all of the cubes.

Proof of theorem 1.1. We divide the proof in three steps. :
Step 1. Set-up of the geometric construction. We need to determine a sequence of cubes in R4 on :s
which we replicate rescaled constructions based on proposition 2.2. We denote by Q;, a cube of ae
side-length 4, (both the location of the cubes and the side-lengths are to be determined), and we 4)
denote by Q, the cube with the same centre as Qn and side-length 7n. We will make sure that —
{Qn} is a disjoint family contained in a bounded set and that it clusters to a point. :®
