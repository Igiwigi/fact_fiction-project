6 is cut in section and is suggestive
3 of a mass which is germinating in several directions, the hyphe h on the right
g seeming to come directly from it. iS There are also in the layers of the host very numerous cells filled with a blackened
frothy network, which appears not unlike cells once occupied by fungal clusters
which are now effete, the fungus having probably withdrawn to the outer zones of
the host. 5

Halitâ€”That the fungus was an underground form seems indicated by the fact
that its host was a rhizome or the base of a stem. Whether it was a saprophyte or a
parasite there seems at present no means of determining. Figures given by Harric
(1880) show swollen, thickened cells arising from the mycelium of a living form, which
are very similar to those of this fossil although less extensive.
