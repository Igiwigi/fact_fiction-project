It is,
in fact, the only derivative in the table that might on cursory inspection be mistaken
for cholesterol H,O. The crystal structure in both cases is of an irregular and com-
plicated variety from which it is impossible to expect to draw exact conclusions at this
stage. And while a very natural deduction from the direct comparison of the two
structures would certainly be that in both the hydroxyl group is at C3, one fact, the
further doubling of the Â¢ dimension in cholesterol H,O compared with cholestane-6-ol,
is against it. In any case there is evidently a relation of an intimate geometrical
character between cholestane-6-ol and cholesterol H,O. In the formation of double-layer structures the terminal hydroxyl groups may either
interact directly with one another or through water molecules.
