of the latter, six light longitudinal ribs; in this way the cylinder and piston may
be cut transversely by a series of narrow ports (4/5 inch wide) at equal distances
2 apart. As the piston vibrates the main air supply (referred to as the “sounding
air”) is admitted intermittently from a cast-iron chamber completely surrounding
the cylinder and connected through a large relay valve to the compressed-air tanks
and compressors.

The variation of pitch with pressure (referred to as “pitch regulation”) was
measured by means of the phonometer and was found to be relatively small; it is
seen from Table III. of Appendix I. that the pitch only increases from 169 to 182
complete vibrations per second for an increase of operating pressure from 12 to
27 lbs./sq. in. above atmospheric. This characteristic, which contributes greatly
to the satisfactory performance of the instrument, is probably due to the fact that
the frequency is governed largely by the mass of the piston and the elastic reaction
of the air in the trumpet (toned to resonance at pitch 180) and in the space behind
the piston-head (“cushioning effect ”).

The operation of the valves so as to give the blasts at the required intervals is
automatic. By means of a suitably adjusted cam mechanism connected to the main
shaft of the engine driving the compressors, a small valve is first of all opened
causing a second valve to admit the “driving air” to the driving cylinder, thus
setting the piston into vibration; the same valve also admits air into a large relay
valve, allowing the main “sounding air” to pass into the diaphone a fraction of
a second later, so that the note begins to sound only when the piston has attained
its normal frequency. In fact, the sharp commencement of the note and its sudden
