(1925, b) and Ho-Nren Cuu (1932) describe for the opossum. The fornix is poorly
defined and passes with some medial fore-brain fibres to the lateral nucleus,
fig. 19. The peduncle of corpus mamillare arises from the lateral nucleus. From
the medial nucleus arise the rudimentary fasciculus mamillo-thalamicus and the
tractus mamillo-tegmentalis.

The Peduncle of the Corpus Mamillare—The peduncle is the largest fibre tract related
to the mamillary body. It arises from the lateral nucleus and passes dorsally and
caudally in a wide curve. This tract comes into close relation with the medial
lemniscus and may give fibres to or receive them from the lemniscus. Despite its
size, fig. 18, the peduncle sis soon lost in the tegmentum. It was not possible
to trace any fibres to the central grey matter which Tsar regards as their probable
destination. The relation to the medial lemniscus is of interest in view of the fact
that some authors have suggested the passage of gustatory fibres from the lemniscus
to the mamillary body by way of the peduncle.

The Tractus Mamillo-Tegmentalis—This tract arises from the medial nucleus of the
mamillary body and runs caudally with the peduncle of the corpus mamillare.
Some of its fibres end in the ventral tegmental nucleus, the remainder pass on
to the tegmentum. ‘Tsar suggests that this tract also reaches the central grey
matter, but that is not clear from these sections.

The Supra-Mamillary Decussation—This appears to be the same as the decussation
described by ZreHEN (1908) as “ Schnopfhagen’s crossing.” It is of complex origin.
Many of the fibres arise from the mamillary body itself, while a few come from the
