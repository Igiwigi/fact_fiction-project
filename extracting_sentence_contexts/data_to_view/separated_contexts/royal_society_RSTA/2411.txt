a traction on the surfaces « and 8, and an increase in the length of molecules whose
long axis was normal to those surfaces would increase the moment of the force at the
surface of slip h/2. But the S$ value relates to a traction and cis positive for this value. The fact that ¢ is positive for the normal reaction may mean that, whilst a surface
of slip is plane and lies between the ends of molecules, a surface of break is not plane
because the molecules are pulled apart like teeth out of their sockets, one half of the
number moving one way and the other half moving the opposite way (cf. p. 15). 6.
