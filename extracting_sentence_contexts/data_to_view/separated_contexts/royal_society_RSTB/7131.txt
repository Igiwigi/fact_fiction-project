Fisher
further pointed out that ‘the error of random sampling, on the other hand, should be
ascertained with high precision from every experiment to which the sampling method was
applied, for on it one relied for judging the number of sampling units which could with
advantage be taken from the growing crop’ (p. 615). This is exactly the point of view
adopted in the present paper. In fact the fundamental criterion used in obtaining the
optimum solution is identical with that stated by Fisher, namely, ‘maximum precision
® in return for the labour expended’, which is conveniently measured in practice in terms
of the total cost. 345. Since the publication of Neyman’s paper a number of other papers have been
published on this subject by Neyman (1938), Stephan (1939), Hansen & Harwitz (1942),
and other workers dealing, however, mainly with investigations relating to human
populations, although the theory has had applications in other fields as well.
