The general conclusions of ViNcENT
and Jouty are that when the thyroid is removed the parathyroids appear capable of
replacing it to a certain extent, and the histological structure of the latter bodies
changes accordingly. They lay great stress upon the difficulties of the operation of
parathyroidectomy, and consider that when this proves fatal it is probably due to the
severe damage simultaneously done to the thyroid. Thyroid and parathyroids are
looked upon as a single physiological apparatus, the two kinds of tissue being
intimately associated embryologically and working together physiologically,

In a later paper Vincentt lays stress upon the fact that the two structures are
derived from very similar sources, and even in their fully developed state there is no
fundamental difference between their constituent cells. Forsytu} looks upon the parathyroids as essentially thyroidal in nature, possessing
no peculiar function, but engaged in the active secretion of the same substance as the
