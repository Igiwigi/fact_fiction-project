Europe, in the 1000 Genomes data, and compared their
contribution to the frequencies in these regions (figure 5).

We see that 18 HLA-A and 20 HLA-B alleles, which collec-
tively contribute to approximately 60% cumulative frequency
in Africa, reach less than 10% in Europe (for HLA-C alleles
the differences among regions are smaller). The striking
differences in allele frequencies among geographic regions
for HLA-A and HLA-B were also observed in an independent
dataset containing data from multiple populations [14] (elec-
tronic supplementary material, figures S1-S3). The allele
frequencies in figure 5 show that the distribution of HLA
alleles is in fact geographically structured, but as a conse-
quence of the extreme polymorphism the overall Fgr
remains low [41,42]. We do not see this as a limitation of
Fsy, but as an expression of the information Fsr conveys,
which is related to the evolutionary history of the population
and locus of interest, rather than serving as a direct measure
of differences in allele frequencies. Here, low Fey reflects the
high diversity (and low kinship) both within and between
regions, a key feature of HLA polymorphism.

What are the consequences of the large differences in allele
frequencies between geographic regions (figure 5) to the
chances of finding a matching donor in a repository? Nunes
