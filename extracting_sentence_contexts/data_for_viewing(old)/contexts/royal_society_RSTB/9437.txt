during development. Mutations are thought to be one
cause of cresting in cacti, as many will ‘breed true’ [162].
Other plant cancers are a result of interspecific crosses, result-
ing in a profusion of tumours on all parts of the plant after
the hybrid has reached maturity (as reviewed in [158]).
Plant tumours are characterized by both abnormal prolifer-
ation and large cell size [166], suggesting that proliferation
inhibition and resource allocation cheating may contribute
to these growths.

Plant tissue architecture and development differs from
animal tissue architecture and development in ways that
are likely to be important for cancer suppression. In fact,
some have argued that plants are not particularly susceptible
to cancer because plant tissue architecture and development
keeps cells fixed in place within the cell wall matrix, con-
straining the capacity of neoplastic plant cells to freely
travel through plant tissue in order to invade and metastasize
[167]. However, some papers have reported metastasis-like
phenomena in plants, with tumour strands emanating from
primary plant tumours [166]. Bacteria-free tumours have
also been reported at secondary sites without the apparent
presence of tumour strands [159]. This suggests that neoplasms
in plants may indeed be capable of invasion and establishment
of a tumour at a new site (without the presence of bacteria),
