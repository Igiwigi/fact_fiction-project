The only part of this scheme of equations that is incomplete is the specification Â¢

an ordinary conductor this current is of the same order of magnitude as the polari
zation current, which is itself wholly masked by the current of conduction, except i
the case of optical phenomena. In a dielectric this current does not exist at all.

ever the wther between them be disturbed, shows that they will tend to drive
ch other to the surfaces of the conductors, so that the current (1m, vp, wy) will
sually be a transient phase at the beginning of the settling of the disturbance,
agreement with the above, if it ever exist at all; and once the free charges are on
he surfaces of the conductors they will remain there and be redistributed by ordinary
onduction currents. This part of the current may therefore possibly be left out of
ecount ; that is, the electric density in a good conductor at rest may be taken to be
ways null.
