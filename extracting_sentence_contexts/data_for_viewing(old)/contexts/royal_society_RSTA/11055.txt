Thus the greatest error introduced into the value for the concentration of the
solutions by this part of the operations is about one in two thousand.

Constancy of Resistance of the Solvent.—During the early stages of the work it
was found impossible to keep the resistance of the water in the cell at a constant
value for any length of time, rapid increase in conductivity always appearing. This
change occasioned great difficulties, in fact months were given to the investigation of
its cause and cure. It seemed to be due to the gradual absorption of traces of
impurity (such as carbonic acid, &c.) from the atmosphere, for whenever a fresh
quantity of air found its way into the apparatus, the resistance fell for some time,
the fall being quicker when the screw was kept in continual motion. It was therefore
found advisable to fill the cell for some time before using it, for while the contents
were cooling, air was of course being drawn in, and, until all the impurities in that
volume of air had been absorbed, no constancy of resistance could be obtained.
Again, when the contents were levelled, water was drawn out, and, therefore, air
entered to replace it, and this also caused variation for some little time. This leakage
of air also oceurred when salt had been added, chiefly at the moments when stock
solution was being introduced into the cell. Its effect was to change the form of the
ionization curves for dilute solutions, the impurities as they gradually accumulated
