Another caveat that
needs consideration is that life-history details may result in
apparent idiosyncrasies. Ageing is not necessarily a linear

process. In fact, there is evidence that reproductives in
social animals have negligible mortality rates [65], and ant
and termite queens die rather suddenly without showing
strong reproductive senescence [59,66,67]. However, infor-
mation on such life-history data is scarce [68] and is still
accumulating only slowly for social insects [67,69-72]. If
ageing is not a gradual process, then data just comparing
‘older’ and ‘younger’ individuals are unlikely to reveal senes-
cence processes.
