Scholinm 1. As the two first theorems depend on the
differences of the coefficients of the immediate terms or
omitting none, the two last on the differences of the coefti-
cients of the alternate terms or omitting one term; $0 we
may give theorems for the differences of the coefficients of

the terms, omitting 2, g, &c. terms; in fact, if r be a whole
number, and the terms of the series be all positive, or any
how positive and negative by sets, provided- the same signs
return in the same order after every set, consisting of r
number of terms; by continually multiplying by 2 sine of
—qz, we shall get new series by taking the differences of the
coefficients of every term and the rth succeeding term begin-
ning with 7 number of noughts ; except indeed that the coef-
ficients of the terms will sometimes have the order of signs
interrupted, namely, when a greater value is to be subtracted
from a less, But if every set should have the same order to signs con-
trary to those in the set immediately preceding, and conse-
quently every set omitting one set continually, have the same
order of signs, then by continually multiplying by 2 cos. of
—gz, we shall get new series by taking the differences of the
coefficients of any term and the 7th term from it.
