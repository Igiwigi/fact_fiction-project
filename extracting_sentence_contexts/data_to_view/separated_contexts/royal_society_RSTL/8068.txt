Small patches of the outer bark appear (fig. 29, 7) attached to the
inner surface of the epidermal layer. All these patches consist of the same oblong fusi-
form prosenchyma as that adhering to the exterior of the ligneous zone. Coupling these
facts with the additional one that all the numerous detached fragments of bark seen in
the specimen consist of beautiful examples of the same tissue of uniform size, unmixed
with any other; and arranged in parallel lines with the greatest regularity, I arrive at
the conclusion that the entire bark has closely resembled that of the plant indicated by
Plate XXV. fig. 8. At the junction of the outer bark (4) with the epidermal layer (7)
we find the usual transition of the fusiform into the tubular form of prosenchyma
