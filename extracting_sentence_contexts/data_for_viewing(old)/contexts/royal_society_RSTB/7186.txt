are formed within the apical meristem some distance below the apical cell; scales are formed
at the base of the apical cone, i.e. in the region of transition between the densely protoplasmic
cells of the apical meristem and the vacuolating parenchymatous cells of the subapical
region; buds, which may grow into lateral shoots, arise on the subapical region,
i.e. below the apical cone, but they originate from cells which formed part of the apical
meristem.

Both leaf and bud primordia arise from equivalent groups of superficial meristematic
cells. In fact, the initial stages of bud and leaf formation are difficult to distinguish; each
begins as an outgrowth or mound of tissue in which, at an early stage, a centrally placed
apical cell is formed, all subsequent growth of the primordium being referable to this
apical cell. The chief differences between leaf and bud primordia are these: (i) leaf
primordia are formed on an organized apical meristem and nowhere else, whereas bud
primordia arise from a group of isolated meristematic cells lower down on the shoot,
i.e. there need not be a pre-existing organized meristem; (ii) leaves have dorsiventral
symmetry whereas buds have radial symmetry; and (iii) leaf formation and development
are not inhibited by an active apical cell whereas bud formation and development are.
These are among the facts of organ formation which await explanation.

Leaf primordia are formed on the sides or flanks of the conical apical meristem. As a consequence
of the distribution of growth at the apex (§§5(a) and 10(a)), the lower or abaxial side of
