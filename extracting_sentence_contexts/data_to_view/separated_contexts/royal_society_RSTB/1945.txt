Beyond this, which is indeed nothing more than a statement of the facts, widely
divergent opinions have been expressed. The explanation which may be given on
the theory of homologous alternation may be first considered, since the views held by
authors who have written from the standpoint of the antithetie theory are rather
critical than constructive. It is unnecessary to add anything further regarding the possible significance of
the facts of induced apogamy, with which instances of direct apogamy have been
connected by intermediate forms, on the theory of homologous alternation. On the
view that the sporophyte is descended from a similar form to the gametophyte, a
comparison of apospory with gametophytic budding suggests itself. The position of
the aposporous growths may similarly be related to the capacity of the cells of the
part for further growth.
