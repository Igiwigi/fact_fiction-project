Further, the highest count of all, 1818 mitoses noted after five injections, was considerably
higher than the highest count obtained in any normal animal even in the post-ovulation
oestrous period. It will also be noticed that the mitoses induced artificially bore little or
no relation to the large ovarian follicles as they did in the normal animal in oestrus. The
greatest numbers of the induced cell divisions were found, in fact, to be unrelated to any
prominent ovarian structure. It seems probable that the great variation in the results
obtained was due to the fact that, in those animals which gave relatively low mitosis counts,
the connective tissue capsule surrounding the ovary had prevented the oily solution of
oestrone from reaching that organ, whereas in the others which were highly stimulated the
solution had actually penetrated into the capsule.

(ii) Ovarian follicle

Normal adult. The interior of the ovary is filled with masses of connective tissue, or
stroma, in which are embedded the ovarian follicles and corpora lutea.
