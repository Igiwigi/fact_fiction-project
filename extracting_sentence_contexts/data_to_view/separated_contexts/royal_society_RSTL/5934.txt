The expenditure of heat per pound of steam (supposing the feed-water to be supplied

to the boiler at the temperature of exhaustion, 7) is represented by the indefinitely-pro-

longed area RFBCM, and consists of two parts,—

The sensible heat REBL=IJ(4—t,), where J is the specific heat of liquid-water,

If the feed-water is supplied to the boiler, not at the temperature of exhaustion, t,,
but at some lower temperature, Z,, the latter temperature must be substituted for the
former in the formulee. '

The application of these principles to steam-engines without jackets has been fully
explained and exemplified in the paper already referred to in the Philosophical Trans-
actions for 1854. Calculations respecting such engines in ordinary cases are facilitated by approximate
formule, founded on the fact that within the usual limits of pressure, viz. with p,=
from one to twelve atmospheres, the coordinates of the curve CM are related by the
equation
