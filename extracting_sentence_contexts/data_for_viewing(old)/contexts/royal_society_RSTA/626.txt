the dephasing representation is exact [15] if the classical trajectories are propagated with the
average Hamiltonian H since then the Hamiltonian difference (3.11) is indeed linear in Aq and 2s
Ap: Da

H"(x") — HQ) = Pap + kg(a + Aq). (42) 8

By contrast, the dephasing representation is not exact even in this simple system if H’ is used for thy
dynamics, as quadratic terms in both Aq and Ap appear: :3

1 1
H'(x") — H'(x)= mCP + Ap)Ap + ak2q + Aq)(a+ Aq). (4.3)

Similarly, the dephasing representation is not exact (in fact, breaks down rather severely) for
simple harmonic oscillators with different force constants,

z 1 Pol
HaP pik? and HY =P 4 Kg? 4.4
mt 27 aM m2. 7" (4)

as the perturbation is quadratic in Aq even if the average Hamiltonian is used for dynamics:
(ll yt) — P 1 2,1 2
FIN") — AIG) = Ap + gg + 5 Ak q + 7(Aq) : (4.5)

The last simple example provides a particularly bad scenario for the dephasing representation,
which can be remarkably accurate in much more complex, even chaotic systems such as the kicked
