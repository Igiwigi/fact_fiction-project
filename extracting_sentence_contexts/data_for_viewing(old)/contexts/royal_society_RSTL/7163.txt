a safe foundation for 80 decided an opinion respecting the zoological affinities of the
animal. A tolerably perfect skeleton is necessary in order to enable us, from the bones
alone, to draw a safe conclusion as to the structure of the remainder of an animal.”

Singularly enough, D'ALrox does not mention the Megatherium throughout this paper,
which however affords, by implication, an ample demonstration that the bony armour
described has nothing to do with that animal*,

In 1836, LAURILLARD, in editing the eighth volume of the second edition of CuvieR's
£ Os8emens Foxssiles,' appends the following note to the letter of Don D. LARANAGA, quoted
above ;—

«It is yery possible that the Megatherium was, in fact, covered by a scaly cuirass;
but the great fragments which have been found must not be hastily attributed to it ; for
the plaster casts sent from Londonf prove that an Armadillo of gigantic size coexists
with the Megatherium on the plains of Buenos Ayres. These characteristic fragments
consist of a calcaneum, an astragalus, and a scaphoid, which depart from those of existing
Armadillos only in size, and by purely specific differences.”

In 1836, then, it was clearly made out that the cuirassed extinct animal of South
America is not the Megatherium and is allied to the Armadillos. However, Dr. BUckLAND,
whose Bridgewater 'Treatise appeared in this year, and who therefore could hardly have
been acquainted with the views of D'ALrox and of LauRiiLanD, still associated the
dermal armour with the Megatherium—snpporting his views by an elaborate and inge-
nious teleological argument, which, like most reasonings of the kind, appeared highly
