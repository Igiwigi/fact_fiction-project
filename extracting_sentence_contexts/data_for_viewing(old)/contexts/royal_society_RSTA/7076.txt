.#? = 0), and on this basis the quantities (15-4) were evaluated for @? = 0 and 20 and inter-
polated linearly in .@} for other values. This is certainly not accurate, but even if slightly
incorrect values of the quantities (16-4) are used the only result is that a few more trial
solutions have to be made before the criterion given by the sign of (16-3) is satisfied, and even
ifsix trials have to be made instead of two, this only adds 2 min. to the total time of obtaining
a final solution, whereas evaluating the quantities (16-4) from three (or five) preliminary
solutions for each value of .@?, and punching and verifying a card for supplying these data
to the machine would take longer than this, and the alternative process of working out an
addition to the machine set-up to evaluate the quantities (16-4) from such a set of solutions
would take longer than the aggregate time taken by the few additional solutions needed on
account of the use of inaccurate values of the quantities (16-4). So the apparently crude use
of approximate values of the quantities (16-4) is in fact the most efficient. This, of course,
is a result of the high computing speed of the ENIAC and the short time which it takes to
evaluate a single trial solution.

An example of the results of this process is shown in table 1. The first two columns give
the successive estimates of 4(0) and 7(0), the second two the resulting values of (5)
and 1,(0).
