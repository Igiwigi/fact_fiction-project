directions equally. The second begins as parenchyma in sections Nos. 1 and 2 and has
a small lumen in Nos. 3 and 4, which enlarges and continues so til section No. 12 is
reached, when it is pierced by a ray and in the next section has a ray alongside it. The
third one of the scattered canals has one peculiar feature. A leaf trace diverted it to
the right in section No. 34. With this explanation, the interpretation of the character
and course of the short series of five can be followed. It became reduced to four by
fusion of two in section No. 3. In No. 9 it became again five, in No. 12 three, etc., until,
finally, in section No. 35 it became one and continued so for many sections beyond the
series plotted. The changes indicated occurred in less than a millimetre, the sections
being about 25y thick. The irregularity of the courses of the various canals in
this series (cf. Photo. 19, Plate 9) is perhaps what strikes one most, in contrast to the
more direct of the single canals. Once the scattered system is established it usually
persists for a considerable distance. Probably it is this fact that has led to the
assumption that such canals are normal. They are, however, only the persistent ends
of the traumatic series.

Turning again to the diagram, fig. 4 (p. 88), and following the same year’s growth
(the second year from the outside) below the lapse of canals, as indicated in Nos. 7,
6 and 5, we come to No. 4, where there are seven scattered canals, No. 3 with nine and
No. 2 with fourteen, while in No. 1 there are thirty-five which continue through Nos.
— 1 and — 2 into the root region, with slight variations, to No. — 3, where a wound is
