structure x formal structure (F;,29 = 7.59, p < 0.02). Informed (r= 0.15, p = 0.65) and deviants (r = 0.06, p = 0.86), as well


as for irregular standards (r = 0.21, p= 0.54) and deviants
(r= 0.15, p = 0.66). Thus, independent of lesion size, these
P3b results provide evidence for the significant impact of
cerebellar pathology on the use of temporal predictability
and the updating of a mental model of the environment as
reflected in the P3b. Moreover, the fact that deviance pro-
cessing was most affected in temporally regular, but not
irregular context substantiates initial assumptions that struc-
tural damage to the cerebellum leads to imprecise encoding
and use of temporal structure, and accordingly to the encod-
ing and use of temporal regularity. This, in turn, affects
optimized deviance processing in the case of maximal
temporal predictability as seen in the control group.
