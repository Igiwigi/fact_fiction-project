matter, The ebonite ring was firs wound on August 9, 1882, and its galyanometer
constant was compared with that of one coil of the dynamometer by Mr. J. M.
Dopps. The result agreed very ill with the measurements taken during the winding,
and led to the s8nspicion that several turns were short-cireuited by a false contact.
The matter was put to a further tesb in two ways. A second coil of the same
dimensions was wound with the same number of turns; and the two coils were
placed co-axally close together, and 80 connected in series thab a current would
circulate opposite ways. The circuit was completed by a galvanometer of long
period. Under these circumstances when one pole of a very long steel magnet is thrust
suddenly through the opening, there shonld be no effect observable if the insulation
is good ; but if any of the turns of one of the coils are short circuited the other coil
will of course have the advantage, and the galvanometer will indicate a current mn the
corresponding direction. Tt was found in fact that the second coil preponderated, and
that 13 extra turns had to be pub upon the firs coil to obtain the balance. With

per precautions this method of testing seems satisfactory, being approximately
independent of the equality of mean radii of the coils compared.
A second test was s8uggested and executed by Mr. GLAzEBROOK, The two coils
â€” retaining a fixed position, the ratios of the self-inductions of each to the mutual in-
duction of the pair were determined by MaxwerrL's method.* These ratios, which
should have been nearly equal, were found to differ considerably in the direction which
showed a deficiency in the self-induction of the ebonite coil.
