When the Nicol is introduced parallel to the plane of incidence, presumably half
the incident light is cut off. Consequently the large particles send only half the
yellow-red light up the tube that they previously sent. Owing, however, to the fact

that the minute spheres send no light directly up the tube when the electric vector
of the incident light is parallel to the microscope tube (Nicol perpendicular to plane of
incidence), less than half the green light from any small spheres will be cut off. The
cone of light will therefore have more green in proportion to the yellow-red than
before the introduction of the Nicol.
