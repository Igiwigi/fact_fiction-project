surface, as we have seen earlier. Only a few measure-
ments have been made of value 8 (XT, 288), attention
will therefore be confined to value B.

The solid joint was formed by running fluid lubricant between the faces, allowing the
lubricant to come into equilibrium with the attraction fields of the solids, and then
lowering the temperature until the lubricant froze (XI, 209). All the measurements,
which will be referred to, were made with load 5-6 grammes, loading (load divided by
area) 7-15 grammes, and distance between cylinder and plate h = 0-007 mm. for
clean surfaces and + 0-005 mm. for contaminated surfaces. When the joint was
broken, the surface of break was seen under the microscope to lie between an adsorbed
layer of insensible thickness, x or z in the diagram, and a median crystal plate y. The
presence of an invisible adsorbed layer was detected by the fact that after the joint
was broken the friction was that of a fully lubricated surface (XI, 214). The significant
surfaces of a solid joint then are placed as shown in the diagram at @ andy. When
cylinder and plate were both of steel or both of copper, the break took place at both
6 andy. When one of the two was of copper and the other of steel, it was, at the
