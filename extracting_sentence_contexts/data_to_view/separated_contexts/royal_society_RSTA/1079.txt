8 shows a diagrammatic scheme for the distribution and interaction of the
three elastic phases of the hair fibre. It is based on idealized rhombic dodecahedra
elongated along a tetrad axis, but the precise form is immaterial to the argument that
the phase K, effectively forms a continuous sheet between each layer of cells, and that
all three phases act both in series and in parallel. Furthermore, it must be emphasized
that the whole treatment in this paper is based on the hypothesis, which appears to
be consistent with the known facts, that there is no sharp demarcation between the phases,
and. that, fundamentally, they must all be considered as “ keratin,” though keratin slightly
variable mainly through certain side-chain modifications. From this point of view we
must regard the intercellular keratin, K,, as being deficient in certain of the chemical
cross-linkages which bridge the main chains (such as the cystine bridge—see below),
the cell-wall keratin, K,, as being most crystalline or most “ organized ” (as one might
expect from other X-ray investigations of cell-wall structuret), and the intracellular
keratin, Ky, as being physico-chemically the most resistant of all three.
