ZIMMERMANN supports NXget1’s conclusion that the high resistance in a JAMIN’S
chain is due to the viscosity of the surface tension membrane being higher than in
the interior of the liquid, and is not due to any interaction between the wall and
membrane. ‘This is a curiously contradictory statement, since an increase of
viscosity can raise the resistance to flow only by frictional interaction with the walls.
The fact that Jamuy’s chains, formed with air and such liquids as alcohol or ether,
which keep the- walls permanently wetted, do not develop any, high resistance on
standing, is sufficient to show the true source of this phenomenon. Owing to the
ready permeability of the walls of the wood-vessels to. water, complete adhesion of
the menisci never takes place in living functioning wood-vessels containing water
and air-bubbles, and even in vessels filled with air a film of water -lines the
interior. The slow restoration of conductivity when water is forced into a dried
length of a stem is due to the fact that the water enters the closed vessels
laterally through the walls, forming a series of broken columns whose menisci at
first adhere firmly, but subsequently become more freely motile as the walls become
wetter and the air-bubbles smaller (cf. fig. 1, A, C, and D).

ZIMMERMANN gives the maximal resistance of a JAMIN’s chain of air and water
in tubes of 0°2-0°02 centim, diameter as being one-quarter to one-sixth of the
capillary force for the same tube. The magnitude of both forces depends upon the
nature of the tube, of the liquid and of the gas, as well as upon the diameter of
the tube, but no comparison such as that given by ZimMERMANN is possible, since the
Jamin’s chain resistance also depends upon the number of menisci in a given length
of the tube. SrraspurceR* has, however, shown that slight pressure will drive
water through a vessel containing a chain of air-bubbles and water columns,
