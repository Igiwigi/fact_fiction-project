The reply is unavoidable. We should undoubtedly con- 8ider the experiment with the flower-pot as clearing up our preexisting ignorance ; we
should regard the fact of their producing cresses and grasses as proof positive that the
particles 8own in the earth of the pot were the seeds of the plants which have grown
from them. It would be simply monstrous to conclude that they had been © spon-
taneously generated.” This reasoning applies word for word to the development of Bacteria from that floating
matter which the electric beam reveals in the air, and in the absence of which no Bac-
terial life has been generated.
