A salient feature of their models is the emergence of
frequency-dependent selection, which varies in nature from
positive to negative depending on epistasis between the plas-
mids. Where plasmids reduce one anothers’ costs, the co-
infected state is favoured, causing rare plasmids to spread,
whereas if plasmids exacerbate one anothers’ costs then rare
plasmids are suppressed by dominant ones. The fact that the
presence of other plasmids in a community can dramatically
affect plasmid fate underlines the importance of considering
the effects of a plasmid in the context of other MGEs. Conflicts and collaborations between MGEs also extend
across MGE types. In a series of experiments extended and
explored with deterministic modelling, Igler et al. [43] investi-
gate how conjugative plasmids and integrative prophages
affect each other’s transmission.
