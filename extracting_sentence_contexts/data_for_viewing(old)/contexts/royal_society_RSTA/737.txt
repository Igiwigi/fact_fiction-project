In our recent work on the photodissociation of methyl iodide at 193nm, we show that non- Lo |
resonant contributions could, in some cases, overcome the resonant signal. When the probe laser

was tuned to the CH3(v2 = 1) resonance, for instance, the main contribution in the translational a
energy distribution had to be surprisingly assigned to non-resonant MPI signal of CH3(v2 =0). A 2
small shoulder assigned to REMPI detection of CH3(v2 = 1) and minor contributions from MPI of : <

CH3(v1 = 1,v2 =0,1) were clearly observed at lower translational energies. Our results reproduced
those obtained by Pratt and co-workers using VUV universal detection [13]. MPI excitation has,
however, an unexpected advantage over the VUV detection related to the Franck—Condon factors.
As Pratt and co-workers state, the vibrational frequency of the v2 umbrella mode in the ion
is nearly double than that in the neutral. This fact implies that the Franck-Condon envelope
spreads over a broad range of vibrational levels in the ion, and that the range will increase as the
vibrational excitation in the neutral is increased. Because the VUV photon energy is only approx. :
5170cm~! above the ionization threshold for CH3, as the vibrational excitation is increased, an [=
increasing fraction of the Franck-Condon envelope will become energetically inaccessible, which 5
will reduce in turn the total photoionization cross-section. MPI excitation provides, in principle, :
as much energy above the ionization threshold as needed—either through the photon energy or Da
through the number of photons—and, therefore, selection of favoured ro-vibrational states should :
not be limited by energetic arguments. 74
