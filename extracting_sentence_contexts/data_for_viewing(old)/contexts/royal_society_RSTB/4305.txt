MEASLES EPIDEMICS IN LONDON BY THE METHOD OF THE PERIODOGRAM. 227

harmonies have been calculated, and, in some instances, that of the fourth as well.
This has been done by reducing the number of elements in each of the totals to 20,
which seems sufficient to give the harmonic amplitudes with fair exactness. In
general, the minimum numbers were selected as the point of start. This procedure
certainly tends to reduce the amplitudes, but in a case selected at random in which a
60-term analysis was tested against one of 20 terms the difference found was only
2 per cent. As the method has been applied uniformly it probably does not conceal
any significant fact ; 20 terms certainly give better results than 12 and the use of the
former number does not seriously increase the labour of computation. Though the
arithmetical calculation of the amplitudes, with a few exceptions, has only been
carried out for the totals of the 75 years, yet the first additions for each period were
made in four groups each including the statistics of from 18 to 19 years. The results
of these separate additions were graphed on squared paper. Watching the progress
of the maxima from group to group it was possible to guess whether a larger
amplitude might be obtained for a period lying between two of the serial periods.
In some such cases higher amplitudes were found, in others lower. It seems
impossible by inspection of a series of graphs when slight variations in length of a
period are taking place to say, without the work of rewriting the figures, which of
two close periods will have the larger amplitude when the whole figures are summed,
It is, however, in general possible to say for each group of years by inspection which
