Signals from the parallel inputs to
V5, from V1 and from the subcortex (LGN-pulvinar), reach
it asynchronously. Signals from fast-moving stimuli (more
than 22° s_') reach V5 with latencies of about 30 ms, whereas
those from slowly moving stimuli (less than 5° s~') reach it
(through V1) at latencies of about 60 ms [68]. This temporal
privileging of the fast motion input into V5 no doubt reflects
the fact that, although the pathways to the cortex from the M,
P and K systems are mixed within it [93,94], the M system
probably constitutes the dominant one that inputs into V5. The asynchronous input into V5 from these two parallel
systems is complemented by what are probably also asyn-
chronous inputs into it from antecedent cortical visual
areas, including V1 and V2. Smith et al. [95] report that
responses of cells that signal component motion in V5 start
about 6 ms earlier than cells that respond to pattern motion
and that it takes about 50—75 ms for pattern motion cells to
build up their selective profile, suggesting a temporal hierar-
chy.
