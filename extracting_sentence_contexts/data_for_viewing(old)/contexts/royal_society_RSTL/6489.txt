pofttion, the wind moves 4, miles an hour ; and for
every 6 turns in a minute, of the enlarged ſails in
their beſt poſition, the wind will move 5 miles an
hour,

The following table, which was communicated
to me by my friend Mr. Rouſe, and which appears to
have been conſtructed with great care, from a con-
fiderable number of facts and experiments, and which
having relation to the ſubject of this article ; I here
inſert it as he ſentit to me: but at the ſame time muſt
obſerve, that the evidence for,thoſe numbers where
the velocity of the wind exceeds 50 miles an hour,
do not ſeem of equal authority with thoſe of 50 miles
an hour and under, It is alſo to be obſerved, that
the numbers in col. 3. are calculated according to the
ſquare of the velocity of the wind, which, in mode-
rate velocities, from what has been before obſerved,
will hold very nearly. y
