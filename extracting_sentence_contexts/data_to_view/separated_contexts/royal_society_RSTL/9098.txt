He
& found particularly that the spectrum produced by passing electric sparks between
= silver points was very rich in photographic rays, and he ascertained how far various
S 8nbstances were transparent to these rays. Professor STOKEs at the same time com-
Z municated results he had obtained when studying the long spectrum of the electric
Z light by receiving the rays on a fluorescent screen. (SToKrs, © On the Long Spectrum
E of Electric Light,” Phil. Trans., 1863, I.) He discovered the fact that certain solutions
Z 8howed light and dark bands which were otherwise invisible. More recently, M. SokeT
A has studied the absorption of the ultra-violet rays of the spectrum transmitted by
various substances, using for the purpose a spectroscope of his invention, which has a
fluorescent, eye-piece. (Sorwr, © Recherches ur VAbsorption des Rayons Ultra-violets
