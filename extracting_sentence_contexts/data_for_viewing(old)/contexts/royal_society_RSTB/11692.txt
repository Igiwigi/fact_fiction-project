the cell is; this structure contrasts with that of skeletal
muscle where the highly regular configurations of actin and
myosin cannot interact if the cell is stretched or compressed
too far [24]. The highly developed cytoskeletal network and
their ability to maintain stiffness over a variety of cell lengths
make smooth muscle cells especially well poised for directing
epithelial morphogenesis.

Another potentially useful property of smooth muscle for
driving morphogenesis is its geometric anisotropy: muscle
fibres tend to orient in one direction within a tissue.
Smooth muscle tissues shorten primarily in the direction of
their fibres, but whether they are, in fact, stiffer in that direc-
tion remains unclear. Studies of the stiffness of individual
smooth muscle cells and whole smooth muscle tissues in
different organisms have yielded conflicting results, with
some reporting that tissues are stiffer along the long axis of
the cells [36] and others reporting higher stiffness along the
short axis [37]; significant changes in stiffness anisotropy
occur after contraction [38,39]. This is even less well studied
in embryonic smooth muscle. Many smooth muscle-contain-
ing organs have multiple smooth muscle layers, often with
one circumferentially and one longitudinally oriented layer,
which may be particularly important in tissues where these
different layers differentiate at different times.
