electronegative element, may possibly be accounted for in the same way. Free oxygen
and ozone are strongly paramagnetic, but no semblance of an additive nature of the
magnetic property is found in any of the oxygen compounds.

The appearance of strong magnetism in the Heusler alloys and its disappearance in
manganese steels, are similar effects, dependent on the formation of intermetallic
chemical compounds accompanied by an electron transfer.

There are many paramagnetic substances which possess molecular magnetic
moments comparable with, and in some cases much superior to, those shown by ferro-
magnetic substances. The apparent feeble susceptibility they possess is due to the
fact that, with the largest magnetic field which can be applied, we can never produce
anything like a saturation effect. In fact, according to Wess, the molecule of cobalt
chloride, Co,Cl, contains 25 magnetons, while an atom of cobalt below the critical
temperature contains 9 magnetons. We may well ask ourselves—what is the nature
of the process by which the addition of a diamagnetic substance, H.Cl to cobalt,
produces such a large increase in the number of magnetons per molecule.{ Assuming
the work of Wetss holds good, and there is certainly a very considerable amount of
evidence in favour of his theory, we can interpret this result either by supposing that
the atom of cobalt really contains more than 9 magnetons,§ or else that the
diamagnetic acid supplies the additional magnetons when it acts on the cobalt to form
the chloride. In either case, it seems that we must admit that a molecule may
possess systems of magnetons which, in certain circumstances, are so arranged to
counterbalance one another, producing no additional moment of the molecule.|| These
magnetons would contribute nothing to the paramagnetic or ferro-magnetie property
