The posterior arch (0.a. 9) continues to
Mic. 10.—Reconstruction of right side grow antero-dorsally, and forms the main occipital

of posterior region of the skull at arch. The arch in front of it (0.@. 8) remains low,

S-day stage, showing cranial ribs, yt ig prominent in such sagittal sections as pass

neon Focen Aner sid through the cervical neural arches, fig. 31, Plate 46. The remaining arches are even lower, and, in fact, lose almost all individuality; that
it is justifiable to regard them as definite primary arches follows from their seg-
mentation as revealed by the nerve-roots to which they are related.

(ii) Discussion—The development and somitic constitution of the metotic region
of the head of the bird has been a centre of much confusion in the literature. Certain
of the earlier workers asserted that as many as three or four somites arose in front
of the one earliest formed in ontogeny. This extreme view is, however, undoubtedly
incorrect, and has been sufficiently criticized by Prarr (1889), whose interpretation
alone need be considered here.
