The passive ignorance of
energy systems and costs provided the device behind the 2009 BBC1 science magazine show
Bang Goes the Theory’s one-off special The Human Power Station: ‘We're going to put a typical
family’s energy use under the spotlight to examine our love of this stuff: electricity’. Presented as
a ‘massive experiment’ the peaks of jeopardy were generated by whether the volunteer family’s
ordinary routine could be powered by the 80 cyclists who were hooked up to generators and
concealed in the vast studio next door. Climate change was not referenced within the programme,
rather it was explained in terms of the fact that ‘we’re told we face a global energy crisis which
means big price hikes and worse still shortages. So it’s a good time to ask: how much power do
we all use, where do we waste it and can we do anything about it?’ Listing examples of standard
household energy saving advice the script suggests that ‘ ... you could save yourself quite a bit
of cash, and probably, reduce the damage to the environment at the same time’. In terms of material demand reduction, the programme was notable for its critical focus on
household appliances.
