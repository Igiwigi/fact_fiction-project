to doubt the potentialities of the embryo oocytes, with their uncompleted reduction divi-
sion, than to doubt those of the oocytes formed in the adult which undergo meiosis when
they are shed from the mature Graafian follicles. A more important criticism comes from
the work of Parkes (1929), who showed that, following the complete destruction by X-rays
of the oocytes and follicles in the adult mouse ovary, there is no new formation of germ
cells from the germinal epithelium. However, even if the X-rays do not in themselves
destroy some vital potentiality in the germinal epithelial cells, the absence of ovarian
follicles containing high concentrations of oestrogen may mean the absence of a sufficient
stimulus for the necessary mitotic activity. Such an absence of stimulus may also account
for the lack of ovarian regeneration from the peritoneum of the hilus following complete
ovariectomy (Heys 1931), as well as for the reported failure (Martinovitch 1938) of the
germinal epithelium to form new oogonia when ovaries are grown in vitro, for apart from
the fact that this latter experiment lasted only about a month, normal Graafian follicles
were not produced. The observations made in the course of the present work fully support
Allenâ€™s thesis, and it is concluded that the function of the mitotic activity of the mam-

malian germinal epithelium is partly the production of new epithelial cells, and partly
that of new oogonia, perhaps together with their follicle cells. In the mouse, newly formed
oogonia may be seen in hundreds immediately beneath the germinal epithelium, especially
at the end of each oestrous period. Their continued production in such numbers is necessary
