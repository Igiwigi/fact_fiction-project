It has been argued that
differential sensitivity of these organisms to environmental
perturbations, which can result in changes to their commu-
nities, can support their use as indicators of ecosystem
status. Essentially, biodiversity information for these selected
taxa is the basis for comparative biological analyses of whole-
ecosystem status (e.g. biomonitoring). Although the use of
bioindicators has provided much-needed direct biological
data in ecological and environmental status analysis, the
fact that whole-ecosystem status is inferred through analyses
of a small subset of taxa could miss critical changes in unob-
served parts of the ecosystem. Additionally, in order to assess
ecological processes and their linkages to biodiversity, it is
important to be able to consider biodiversity of all relevant
groups of organisms and their interactions [8]. An ability to
observe biodiversity across its full phylogenetic breadth
offers real potential to study higher-order ecological pro-
cesses and structures by connecting and interpreting the
occurrences of groups of organisms that until now have
proved difficult to consistently observe and identify.

(c) The biomonitoring bottleneck

Another important consideration for biodiversity analysis is
the capacity to generate biodiversity information with appro-
priate frequency so that the data can support a monitoring
scenario.
