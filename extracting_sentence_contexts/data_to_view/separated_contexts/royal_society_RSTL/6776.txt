moments after 8unset. Several authors, he says, attribute this effect to the cold resulting
from radiation of the air during the fine season immediately on the departure of the un.

strata of the atmosphere ”*. Now, however, that the power of aqueous vapour as a
radiant is known, the difficulty experienced by MELLONI disappears.
