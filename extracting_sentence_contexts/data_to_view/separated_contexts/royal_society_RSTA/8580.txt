a += 18,300 atmospheres. These values, it is true, appear rather high when compared with those found from
other considerations, but due importance must be attached to the difficulties of
experimental work of this nature and to the fact that the experimental data have.
been extrapolated over a considerable pressure interval (several thousands of
atmospheres). Comparing these results with those given on pp. 252 to 254 it is considered that a
mean value of the intrinsic stress in diamagnetic crystalline media, viz., 2 x 10° dynes
per square centimetre is representative of the true order of magnitude of the forcive
which binds the molecules in the space lattice of a crystalline medium. This implies
that the energy per unit volume of the diamagnetic crystalline medium, in virtue of
the crystalline grouping, is comparable with 2 x 10° ergs.
