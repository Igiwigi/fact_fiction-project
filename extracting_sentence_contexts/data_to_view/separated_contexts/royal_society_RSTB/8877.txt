Notably, this result diverged from the sharp increase
in routing efficiency observed when non-cost-conserving
randomization models are applied. When conserving cost, ran-
domizing brain connectivity is necessarily accompanied by a
thinning out of the fibre densities (shown in the distribution of
the fibre density of randomized networks, figure 2), because
most randomized connections span greater distances; such
low-density connections do not contribute towards efficient
routing communication. Full latticization of brain networks
does not produce perfect lattices because of the constraints
imposed by the rewiring rule; in fact, a comparison of the
fibre length and density distributions between the latticized net-
works and the respective empirical networks reveals great
similarity between these networks. Latticized networks differ

have a strong tendency to become weakly connected. These new projections appear as a result of rewiring of
edges away from denser pathways, thus sculpting their over-
all pattern into a new topology and steering the population
towards one of the four Pareto fronts.
