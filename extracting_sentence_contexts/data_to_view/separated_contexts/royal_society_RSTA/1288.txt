This is occasionally significantly smaller than the termination tolerance, due to
the nature of the algorithm. The deterministic equivalent problems all failed to solve within 3600s on these problems. In
fact, in all but three examples the deterministic equivalent failed to find any integer solutions. Moreover, for the three examples for which an integer solution was found, the bound-gap
exceeded 25%.

(ii) Varying the number of time periods

The second set of experiments that we have carried out examines how the solution time scales
as we increase the number of time periods in each node of the scenario tree. We will extend the
coal monopolist example from ยง5a(ii), for a scenario tree of depth 3 and degree 3 (13 nodes), with
the number of time periods per node (|T|) increasing from 1 to 12.
