Although it is comparatively easy to find changes in the vertical force which are similar
to corresponding changes in the horizontal force, yet it is much more difficult to find
8imilar corresponding changes in the horizontal force and declination, Inde?d, for many
of the cases recorded in the aboye Table, the declination-change would not be similar to
that of either force. It thus appears that, even in cases which do not indicate the action
of a pure elementary disturbance, the horizontal-force change preserves an almost
invariable relation to that of the vertical forceÂ®,

23, The following would appear to be the explanation of this.

Whatever be the nature of an elementary disturbing force, its effect upon the hori.

* This proves, in addition to a physical fact, that these magnetographs aro capable of recording with pre-
cision the slightest change in either element of the earth's force.

632 MR. B. STEWART ON THE NATURE OF THE FORCES

zontal component of the earth's magnetism bears always a nearly invariable proportion
to its effect upon the vertical component of the same. In this cage it is clear that two
or more disturbing forces superimposed would, as far as regards the horizontal and vertical-
force changes, behave almost in the same manner as a pure elementary disturbance, This
als explains why it is almost impossible to find a peak in the one component of the force
