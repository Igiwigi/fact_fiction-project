It is however worth dwelling on the publicity that the LHC attracted in the days leading up
to switch-on, and has enjoyed ever since, which was triggered by the attempt of an American to
get an injunction to stop the project on the grounds that it might destroy the Earth or the whole
universe. On 1 September 2008, the UK’s Sun newspaper reported this under the headline ‘End
of the world due in nine days’, which was followed by a reasonable description of the LHC’s
aims (surely a first for the Sun, which clearly did not treat the threat seriously). An accompanying
item entitled ‘Don’t panic there’s time to try out every position in the Kama Sutra’ listed nine
things to do before the end of the world: the sixth—‘Drive to Switzerland for a ringside seat of
doomsday’—was no help to me as I already had an air ticket, but the ninth—Cancel the milk and
papers’—was helpful.

On the afternoon of 10 September, the Evening Standard’s bill board read ‘WORLD SURVIVES
‘BIG BANG”: the LHC had entered popular culture. In fact, although the start-up had gone
immaculately, and beams had circulated in both directions that morning, there had been no
collisions, and the world would have survived even if the doomsters had been right. Alas, still
before any collisions, an electrical fault nine days later had catastrophic knock-on effects and
repairs and improvements took until November 2009, when the LHC re-started. But then it
worked, wonderfully well, albeit not yet at full energy.

5. Concluding remarks

The LHC is working way beyond expectations (well above the design luminosity for the energy
reached up to now), the detectors are also working way beyond expectations (at luminosities
which were deemed unusable when the LHC was first discussed seriously in 1984), and the data
analysis is breaking new ground (after approval in 1994, I joked that it was lucky that the LHC
