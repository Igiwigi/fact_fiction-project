In all cases the most ‘“ explosive” effect was observed in the case of the brain in
the skull, the control being evidenced by the simple perforations of skulls emptied of
their contents. A general survey of the results obtained by Bruns shows that the bursting effect
is in proportion to the velocity of the projectile; and we have repeated Kocumr’s
experiments, and have in every respect completely confirmed them. In view of the
fact that, so far as we are aware, no illustrations of such experiments have been
published, we append photographs of some of our own results. Plate 3, fig. 4, shows photographs of two dried dogs’ skulls of similar strength.
