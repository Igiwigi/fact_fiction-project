it is only in
caverns that have been protected from its ravages, that we
may hope to find undisturbed evidence of events in the period
immediately preceding it. "Che bones already described, and
the stalagmite formed before the introduction” of the diluvial
mud, are what I consider to be the products of the period in
question. It was indeed probable, before the discovery of this
cave, from the abundance in which the remains of similar
species occur in superficial gravel beds, which cannot be re-
ferred to any other than a diluvial origin, that such animals
were the antediluvian inhabitants of this country ; but the
proof was imperfect, as it has been said they might have
been drifted or floated hither by the waters, from warmer
latitudes: but the facts developed in this charnel house of the
antediluvian forests of Yorkshire, show'that there was a long
succession of years in which these animals had been the prey
of the hyenas, which like themselves at that time, must have
inhabited these regions of the earth; and it is in' the diluvial
wreck occurring in 8uch latitudes, that similar bones have been

catastrophe producing this gravel, appears. to have been the
last event that has operated generally to modify the surface
of the earth, and the few local and; partial changes that have
succeeded it, such-as the formation of deltas, terraces, tufa,
torrent-gravel and peat-bogs, all conspire to show, that the
period of their commencement was .
