4 and 5, in the Kangaroo and
Ass, the hippocampus major (7), the tzenia hippocampi (o), the plexus choroides (p),
and the foramen Monroianum (y) are brought into view. If a style be thrust trans-
yersely through the internal wall of the ventricle, immediately above the hippocam-
pus, in the placental quadruped, it perforates the septum lacidum (9), and enters the
opposite ventricle below the corpus callosum. If the same be done in the marsupial
brain, the style passes into the opposite ventricle, but is immediately brought into
view from above by divaricating the hemispheres, and is seen lying above the com-
missure of the hippocampi,

This commissure may nevertheless be regarded as representing, besides the fornix,
he rudimental commencement of the corpus callosum ; but this determination does
not invalidate the fact that the great commissure which unites the supraventricular

masses of the hemispheres in the Beayer and all other placentally developed Mam-
malia, and which exists in addition to the hippocampal commissure, is wanting in the
brain of the Wombat: and as the same deficiency exists in the brain of the Great
and Bush Kangaroos, the Vulpine Phalanger, the Ursine and Mauge's Dasyures, and
the Virginian Opossum, it is most probably the characteristic of the marsupial divi-
sion of Mammalia. In the modification of the commissural apparatus above described, the Marsupialia
present a structure of brain which is intermediate to that of the placental Mammalia
and Birds, in which class the great commissure is wholly wanting, and the hemi-
spheres, though comparatively larger than in many of the Mammalia, are brought
into communication only by means of the anterior, posterior, and soft commissures,
and a slight trace of the fornix or hippocampal commissure.
