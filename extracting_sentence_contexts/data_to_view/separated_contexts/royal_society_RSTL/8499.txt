If q be negative and between —+ and —1, we have in like manner a formula

but here 2g+1 being negative, the term &*-'Q does not disappear : the formula has
to be treated in the same way as for q=—4, and we arrive at,

viz. the formula is of the same form as for the potential case q=—+4. Observe that the
formula does not hold good in the limiting case q=—1.
17. We have, in fact, here the potential of the disk

whence

since in the complete differential coefficient + 2x log « the term & vanishes in compari-

but I have not particularly examined this formula.
