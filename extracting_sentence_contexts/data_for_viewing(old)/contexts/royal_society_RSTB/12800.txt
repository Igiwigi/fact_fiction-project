strate, thereby initiating the mechanisms underlying the
directional migration of the aggregate. In particular, the pla-
code first remains fixed, while elongating along the stripe
of the chemical, see figure 4d. Both the PM agents at the lead-
ing edge of the proto-organ and the dPM individuals forming
the rosette body at its trailing edge in fact express the
migratory receptor Cxcr4 and extend towards the SDFla:
this results in a force balance that inhibits the overall move-
ment of the cluster, as also observed in [13]. At t2 =22 hpf,
see figure 4e, a second rosette-like cluster assembles, just
caudally to the first proto-neuromast. Soon after, see figure
4f , the primordium begins to actively migrate: dPM cells
forming the first rosette in fact undergo partial epithelializa-
tion, thereby not longer expressing Cxcr4 but its not-
migratory-related counterpart Cxcr7. As a consequence,
only the caudal part of the primordium is subjected to the
SDFla-induced velocity contribution being therefore free to
advance, eventually dragging the entire embryonic organ
though adhesive interactions and FGF10-related dynamics.

During migration, additional rosettes sequentially form
towards the caudal region of the aggregate, see figure 4Â¢,h.
Just after the assembly of the fourth proto-neuromast, pE par-
ticles forming the most rostral rosette (i.e. the firstly formed)
undergo full epithelialization (because the time-lapse needed
