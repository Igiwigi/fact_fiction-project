If we assume that viscosity is not important, we have diffusion proportional to the
diameter and flow of air proportional to area of the stomatal pore ; or, in other words,
transpiration is proportional to the square roots of the numbers representing the rate
of flow of air as measured by the porometer.

It seems to me, however, that stomata must, on the whole, be considered as tubes.
Thus a widely open stoma of Fouquieria splendens, drawn by Luoyp,t has a tube-
length roughly twice that of the width of the opening. We must therefore consider
the case where the stoma is not to be reckoned an aperture in a relatively thin plate,
but rather a tube whose length is greater than its diameter. “ Diffusion through a
long pipe or channel varies as the area, and flow through it depends on a reduced
area owing to the flowing air adhering to the walls of the tube; in fact, it varies as
the square of the area if the viscosity is predominant. Thus, if this is the case,
3 provided the channels are of fairly uniform width,§ transpiration would be proportional
2 to the square root of flow—the same law as that obtained for the case of holes in a
@ thin plate.”
= Sir JoserpH Larmor was good enough to calculate the size of the stomatal pores in
& the ivy from the rate of flow of an air current through them, as indicated by porometer
s readings. The result was satisfactory, and will, I hope, be published when other similar
= calculations have been made.

: A possible objection may be raised to the porometer, namely, that the rate of
a air-flow through the stomata is not directly proportional to the water-column in the
