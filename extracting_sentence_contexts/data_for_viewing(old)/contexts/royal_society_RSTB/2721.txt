urged that we are mistaken in the identification of the lower jaw, and that it may
occur in the requisite position. We have done our best to find it there, and, in one
instance, thought we had succeeded. In a particularly fine specimen, of which the
ventral surface is shown by Plate 17, fig. 13, a more or less distinct ridge may be
traced running forwards from the gammation, conformable with the quasi-maxilla on
the left side, close to it, and, as longitudinal sections show, below it. The ridge
terminates near the extremity of the transverse arm of the tauidion. If this could
be shown to be the lower jaw the resemblance to a young Ceratodus would he indeed
remarkable. Unfortunately none of our other specimens have afforded evidence that
would confirm this identification, and we are compelled somewhat reluctantly to
abandon it in favour of that we have already proposed.

Again, as a matter of fact, structures corresponding to the hemidomes are not
present in Ceratodus, nor if they were, is it easy to see how the eye could have been
placed in the posterior compartment, which is unprovided with a foramen, through
which the optic nerve could find issue to it.

Tempting as the Dipnoan interpretation certainly is, we are unable to adopt it,
chiefly on account of the great apparent difference in the nature of the suspensorium
and manducatory apparatus.

Sir J. W. Dawson, on what appear to us insufficient grounds, has suggested that
Palseospondylus may prove to be a forerunner of the Batrachia or a primitive tadpole.
There may be other arguments than those he urged in favour of such a view, but the
remarks just offered with regard to the Dipnoi will, for the most part, apply equally
