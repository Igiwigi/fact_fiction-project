(1.) A somewhat viscid, stringy, opaque, white fluid: The fluid itself is trans-
parent, and is, I believe, derived from blood serum and from the glandular
cells of the uterine mucosa. The opacity of the fluid is due to the presence
of great numbers of minute granules; these have their origin chiefly from
the broken down plasmodium which constitutes the bulk of the uterine
mucosa. At the same time, some of the nuclei of the cast-off uterine
tissues, especially the glandular epithelium nuclei, and also degenerate

leucocytes, give rise to granules. I have obtained fresh material from the
uterine cavity of a menstruating monkey which shows these facts.

The glandular fluid itself, when present in the lumen of the glands,
contains granules in small numbers which are apparently excreted by the
glandular cells. Sometimes the discharge is more fluid, at others more
viscid ; sometimes it is more, sometimes it is less opaque, but the variations
are not very great.

(2.) Red blood corpuscles. These are invariably present in quantities sufficient
to colour the discharge either a pale or a dark blood colour; the latter,
however, is rare.

(3.) Masses of uterine stroma tissue, pieces of uterine epithelium, both from the
