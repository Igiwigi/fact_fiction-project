Dear Sir,
Read April 2. YN my late Searches after Sands, Peb-
74: bles, and other Foſlils, in our County

of Norfolk (forme whereof 1 had the Pleaſure to ſend
you not long ago) I made ſuch occaſional Obſerya-
tions on the Situation and Condition of the ſeveral
Bodies 1 met with, as Reaſon muſt, I think, ſuggeſt
to eyery Man that conſiders them. I ſhall trouble
you with no Hypotheſis, nor form any random
Gueſles, to account for ſuch their Situation, and the
Condition wherein - they. are found ; but, if a Rela-
tion of true Facs,- and Concluſions naturally dedu-
cible therefrom, may proye acceptable, they arc in-
tirely at your Service.

In all Strata of Pebbles, that I have yet examined,
there are ſome which are broken, and whoſe Pieces
lic together, or very near cach other; but, as Bodies
of ſuch Hardneſs could not be broken without ſome
conſiderable Force or Violence, their Situation
implies, that they ſuffered ſuch Force or Violence
as- broke their Parts aſunder, in or near the Place
whete they at preſent lie.
