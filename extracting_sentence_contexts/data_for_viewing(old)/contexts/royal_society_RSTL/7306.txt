places of individuals which I could distinguish by some peculiarity of colour, were scarcely
at all altered during the whole period, —the amount of change, in fact, being little more
than would have been exhibited by an equal number of Actiniz. One fine specimen I
particularly noted as having firmly attached itself by the grasp of its dorsal cirrhi to the
tube of a Serpula ; and this it did not let go during the whole time of its captivity.

10. Thus, as regards the ordinary fixedness of its position, the condition of the adult
Antedon only differs from that of its Pentacrinoid larva in this ; that whereas the latter
necessarily remains fixed to the spot to which the base of its pedicle was originally
attached, the former can quit its hold when its attachment is no longer suitable to its
requirements, and can move from place to place in search of another. How intimate,
moreover, is the functional relation between the dorsal cirrhi of the adult Antedon, and
the stem of its Pentacrinoid larva, further appears from the fact that the cirrhi only
