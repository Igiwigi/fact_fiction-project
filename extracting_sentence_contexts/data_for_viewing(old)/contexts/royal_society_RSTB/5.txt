thence that when the conidium is deprived of its protoplasmic contents the remaining
empty shell is barely visible, and easily overlooked, and the same is true of empty
portions of hyphe. It often happens, therefore, that such specimens as those in
fig. 24 (n and r) are not at first sight quite intelligible, until more careful search
results in the discovery that the empty conidia, &c., are still attached ; in other cases,
however, the remains of the conidia become destroyed (e.g., by bacteria, &c.), and the
delicate hyphze containing the protoplasm persist alone. I have excellent reasons for
believing that such hyphze are not necessarily dead, and that the presence of certain
fine hyphze on the leaves is to be explained as above.

First, however, it will be advisable to see what occurs when the conidia are ger-
minating in a drop of water on the leaf of the living Ranunculus, and where the
increased supply of oxygen may be one of several causes for the fact stated aboveâ€”
that the conidia germinate more rapidly.

In figs. 26 and 27 are shown several specimens of germinating conidia, which had
been sown in drops of dew on the living leaf, the plant being kept in a cool green-
house under a glass bell-jar. It is at once noticeable that several of the conidia have
proceeded at once to the development of the germinal hyphae without the preliminary
formation of the secondary conidia; the germinal tubes are thicker and stronger than
is the case with sowings in pure water on glass. Here and there a case occurs (fig. 27)
where the secondary conidium is interpolated. as it were, but this at once proceeds to
develope the germinal mycelium. Of course, the specimens figured ave such as have
not sent their hyphe through a stoma; very many of them would do so about the
second or third day after sowing, as shown in figs. 29 and 31.
