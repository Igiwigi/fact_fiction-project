(Experiments Nos. a, b, ¢, e-j.)

In these nine experiments fifty-eight leaves of H. vulgare were sown with conidia
from 7. vulgare, the leaves being “cut,” and the method of culture adopted as
described above. Infection resulted on forty-six ot the leaves, the conidia producing
patches of mycelium with little groups of conidiophores and ripe conidia on thirty-
seven leaves, and on the remaining nine leaves patches of mycelium only.*
Penetration of haustoria into the epidermal cells took place after 18 hours, and
was at once followed by the vigorous growth of the first haustorium (which soon
became lobed by the development of finger-like processes), and the production of
hyphal branches from the appressorium of the germinating conidium. By about the

* The latter fact I believe to be due to these leaves dying before the fungus had time to produce
conidiophores, and not to the occasional inability of the fungus to produce conidia under the conditions of
culture used.

fourth day the bulbous bases of the first conidiophores were visible, and by 6-8 days
little groups of conidiophores with chains of ripe conidia were formed. These
persisted up to the tenth or eleventh day, sometimes becoming covered with little
powdery heaps of accumulated ripe conidia. None of the thirty-six control leaves
used in these experiments showed any signs ot a fungus, and no fungus appeared on
the “cut” leaves except at the place of inoculation. The leaves used in the
