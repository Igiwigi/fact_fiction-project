than 45, Again, theſe two facts being compared-with..

the aggregate reſult of Mr. Dx Luc's obſervations, where
the lowermoſt barometer ſtood about 1300 feet above
the ſea, the equation for the ſame temperature ſeemed
not to exceed ;+;;, Laſtly, theſe circumſtances being
confronted with the reſults of Mr. poucvurR's obſerva--
tions, where the lowermoſt barometer ſtood from 6000.
to 8000 feet above the os the mean equation for 5 5®'
