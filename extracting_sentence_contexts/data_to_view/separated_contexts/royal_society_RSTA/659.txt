This degeneracy allows the two modes to be the time-reverse partners
of each other, allowing the existence of chirality and C-points even in standing waves at
the bandedge. However, their time symmetry requires the two degenerate modes to possess
oppositely handed C-points at the same location and same frequency, meaning that neither one
can be exploited in isolation for applications. In fact, as the waveguide is multi-moded in the
slow-light regime, we see that the left- and right-handed C-points approach and annihilate in
frequency rather than in space. We note that the lowest group velocity for useful C-points is
Ug Â© c/6, corresponding to when the waveguide supports a single mode. Our analysis of C-points in the slow-light regime highlights some of the difficulties to be
overcome to exploit chirality in quantum information applications.
