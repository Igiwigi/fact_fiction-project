4,7, aa); and that whilst these have no direct connexion with one another,
each of them is connected by means of fleshy peduncles with the annular stolons
bb that run along its extremities ; whilst from the under side of these annular stolons
(fig. 4) descend the thick columns of sarcode (cc, cc), which occupy the columnar
cells of the intermediate stratum. The absence of any essential dependence of the
segments of the sperficial, and of those of the intermediate strata upon each other,
seems indicated by the fact that there is no constant numerical relation between
them,â€”a cireumstance which extremely perplexed me, until I had ascertained, by
examination of the animal, that the passages (Plate VI. fig. 7, e, e e") debouch, not
(as T had at first supposed) into the columnar cavities, but into the annular canal,

which serves to bring the snperficial and columnar segments of each zone into mutual
