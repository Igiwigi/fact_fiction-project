with the freedom of the sporangium from mutual relations with others :” where the
sporangia, as in Aaulfussia, or Danaea, are so closely related that each sporangium is
at most but slightly convex beyond the general level of the synangium, and so has
no freedom for individual change of form on dehiscence, no indurated tissues are
found, which can be held to act as an annulus, for mechanical widening of the slit of
dehiscence, But in Angiopteris; where the sporangia are freely projecting bodies, a
more elaborate mechanism is present; when to these facts are added those relating
to the Gleicheniacese, Schizaeaceze, Osmundace, and the remaining Leptosporangiate
Ferns,{ the above statement seems well founded.. The annulus is in fact only a
specialised region of the tissue of the sporangial wall, and is not an essential part of
the sporangium.

This conclusion accords with the facts of its inconstancy ; for sporangia which open
under water may have no mechanisms. That is the case in Jsoetes, while the sporangia
of the Hydropteridez also are entirely without an annulus, nor is there any stomium,
which would localise dehiscence. Lowsoma is a specially interesting case ; the annulus
though indicated by the cell-divisions as complete, is only partially indurated ;$ it is
shown elsewhere|| that the part which is not indurated could not be mechanically
effective, owing to the mode of packing of the sporangia in the sorus.

+ In Marattia a mechanical system is present, which has the function of making the two-lipped sorts
gape widely as a whole, while the individual sporangia are without any more individual mechanism than
those of Dana or Kaulfussia, See LvErssen, ‘ Beitr, z. Entw. d. Farnsporangien,’ vol. 1, p. 21; also
