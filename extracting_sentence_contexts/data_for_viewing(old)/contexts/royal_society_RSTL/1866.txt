241. A single metallic wire one twentieth of an inch in diameter had an
electric current passed through it, and a small copper disc one inch and a half
in diameter revolved near to and under, but not in actual contact with it
(fig. 39.). Collectors were then applied at the opposite edges of the disc, and
wires from them connected with the galvanometer. As the disc revolved in
one direction, the needle was deflected on one side ; and when the direction of
revolution was reversed, the needle was inclined on the other side, in accordance
with the results anticipated.

242. Thus the reasons which induced me to suppose a particular state in
the wire (60.) have disappeared ; and though it still seems to me unlikely that
a wire at rest in the neighbourhood of another carrying a powerful electric cur-
rent is entirely indifferent to it, yet I am not aware of any distinct facts which
authorize the conclusion that it is in a particular state.

243. In considering the nature of the cause assigned in these papers to
account for the mutual influence of magnets and moving metals (120.), and
comparing it with that heretofore admitted, namely, the induction of a feeble
magnetism like that produced in iron, it occurred to me that a most decisive
experimental test of the two views could be applied (215.).

244. No other known power has like direction with that exerted between
an electric current and a magnetic pole ; it is tangential, while all other forces,
acting at a distance, are direct. Fence, if a magnetic pole on one side of a
revolving plate follow its course by reason of its obedience to the tangential
