resistance may be favourable, and I am inclined to regard the known fact that
signals are in general appreciable at greater distances over sea than over land, as an
effect of the broken surface of ground covered with rocks, buildings, or trees. This
question also remains to be settled by quantitative experimental investigation.

Another difficult question presents itself in the known fact that the signals are
generally stronger by night than by day, and the related fact that the attenuation of
night signals by distance is sometimes less than it would be if they diminished simply

according to the law of spherical divergence. These facts suggest emphatically that
there is, especially at night, some other cause at work besides diffraction, and that it
may be necessary to take into account the possibilities involved in transmission
through a heterogeneous, and perhaps in parts conducting, atmosphere, as is
maintained particularly by Eccies("*) and ("). The view that ionization in the upper
and middle atmosphere may be a cause of variations of the medium, large enough to
be favourable to long-distance transmission, inasmuch as the waves may be partially
refracted downwards, and liable, on occasion, to be unfavourable, inasmuch as the
x refracted waves may be subject to absorption, demands scrutiny, to be conducted by
