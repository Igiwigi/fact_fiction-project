Dr. BREWSTER 07. the laws of polarisation, &c. 20g

have been able to ascertain whether they have one or more
axes; and by examining and measuring the tints which they
exhibit at various angular distances from the axes whence
the forces emanate, I have been led to a general principle
which embraces all the phenomena, and extends to the most
complex, as well as to the most simple developement of the
polarising forces. This general principle is in no respect an
empirical expression of the facts which it represents, nor is it
supported by any empirical data, Founded on the principles
of mechanics, it is a law rigorously physical, and enables us
to calculate all the tints, &c. of the coloured rings, and all
the phenomena of double refraction, with as much accuracy
as we can compute the motions and positions of the heavenly
bodies.
In the course of researches embracing the examination of
.such a great number of crystals, it was natural to expect that
many new facts would present themselves that were but
slightly connected with the general object of investigation.
The phenomena of this kind, which I have had the good
fortune to observe, comprehend several new properties of
