cross-fertilised, but in the experiments on December 13 blastule and larvae were
obtained from the ova cross-fertilised normally, but not from those which had been
kept respectively six and eighteen hours. As regards the hybrid plutei, those
obtained in Exp. 118 were all of different, but more or less intermediate, types. One
of them, which is represented in fig. 17, might be described as of an intermediate type,

inclining, in respect of body skeleton, to the Spherechinus form, whilst the other
three inclined more to the Strongylocentrotus form. They were in fact very similar
to the hybrids represented in figs.7,8,and 9. For further illustrations of the hybrid
larvee reference should be made to the above cited papers of SEELIGER and Boveri.
The larvee obtained in Exp. 171 were even more irregular, one of them being
somewhat similar to that represented in fig. 12, and the other three of irregular
Strongylocentrotus-intermediate type. As regards actual size, the hybrids were on
an average respectively 29°8 and 20°8 per cent. smaller than the pure Hchinus larve,
but respectively 23-2 and 25°3 per cent. larger than the pure Spherechinus. The
um-lengths also were very greatly shortened. These results therefore, as far as they
go, are in accord with those of SreticEr’s, for they prove the great variability of the
hybrid larvae,
