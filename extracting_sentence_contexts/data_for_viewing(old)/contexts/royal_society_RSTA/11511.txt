would then be maintained, as the effect of gravity would be balanced by the upward
pressure of the air on the lower surface of the projectile.

It is interesting to notice that this is the method that experience has taught the
blacks to adopt. Their best non-returning weapons always have strongly developed
positive rounding (the more curved surface is uppermost when thrown) and often a

small negative twist ; examination of the equations will show that these distortions
will combine to produce the required results. An estimate of the efficiency of the
shape may be made from the fact that as far as my experience goes, a boomerang of
this type may be thrown more than twice as far as a spherical object of the same
weight.
