If we make
Athese substitutions in Tables I. and IL, it is readily verified that the present results,
as far as they go, reduce to those obtained by Scuusrer. The extra terms depending

§22. Finally, a word must be said with regard to the legitimacy of our analysis,
considering the fact that if p falls to zero, «’, the resistivity, must become infinite. Regarding the matter physically, it is evident that an infinite resistivity is not likely
to introduce spurious terms into the current potential, and an examination of the
equation (1) for R will show that an actual infinity in «’ would only lead to a
zero term in R. But such an infinite term should not occur in the analysis, and it
