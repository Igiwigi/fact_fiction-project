Since the baseline portfolio, consisting only of mitigation
and adaptation, would remain available to society even if it pursues climate engineering research,
choosing an inferior portfolio involving climate engineering would be irrational. Critics of the
argument from mitigation obstruction might doubt that society would choose inferior portfolios. Thus, some might argue, simply showing that portfolios involving climate engineering could
be worse than the baseline portfolio does not show that mitigation obstruction is a serious
risk, since the fact that they would be worse suggests that policy-makers would not choose
them. The climate engineering literature, however, identifies several mechanisms that cause
society to behave irrationallyâ€”that is, to choose a suboptimal policy portfolio. We can divide
the mechanisms into three kinds: informational failures, cognitive failures and ethical failures.
