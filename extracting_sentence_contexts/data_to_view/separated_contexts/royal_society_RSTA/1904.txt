cals. The data are for solid K, Na, KCl and NaCl, for carbon in the form of diamond, and
for gaseous Cl,, O,, CO and COCI,, in each case per gramme molecule, with the equations
as written. It is difficult to conceive of any way in which the average energy of the
electrons could exceed the equivalent of the heat of formation of two molecules of KCl
from two molecules of K and one of Cl, ; in fact, it is practically certain to be much
less than this. In general, if H is the heat available in gm. cals. per gramme molecule
we shall have as a limit for T

=H

where & is BourzMANN’s constant 1-346 % 107", J is the mechanical equivalent of
heat 4-184 x 10’, and N is the number of molecules per gramme molecule 6-2 x 10%.
