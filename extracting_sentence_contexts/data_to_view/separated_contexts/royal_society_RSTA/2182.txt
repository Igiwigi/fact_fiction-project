This effect has a much smaller influence on the contours of the individual
fringes, although it appears as a striking phenomenon in itself on the photographs. A theoretical investigation, which need not be reproduced here, indicates that the
summits of the maxima—P, Q, R, 8, in the preceding figure—should lie almost
exactly on a parabola when the light falls on the plate at nearly grazing incidence. This parabolic locus of the summits is indicated on the photographs, but in actual
fact the parabola is very nearly a straight line. Indeed, a straight line can be passed
with some precision through any three consecutive summits, and it has been found
sufficient, for the degree of accuracy we desired to obtain, to consider only three
summits, so that the straight line locus can be used. For any given fringe, say CR
in the figure, the “normal” heights of points on the right must be slightly smaller
than the observed values, and those of points on the left must be slightly larger.
