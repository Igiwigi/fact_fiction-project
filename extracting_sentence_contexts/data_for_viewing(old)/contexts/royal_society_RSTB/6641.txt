In the case of Ornithorhynchus I have endeavoured to fill this gap to some extent by
examining a complete series of stages which stopped only just short of tooth eruption.

I have made models of the teeth of Ornithorhynchus at various stages of development,
; as I think that this is essential for adequate study and interpretation (cf. BuURCKHARDT
1906). It is only by this means that other workers can get a reasonably accurate and
concrete impression of such developing structures. It is the more important in this
particular case as Platypus material is peculiarly inaccessible.

3â€”The Dentition of the Monotremes

Far from the least of my reasons for undertaking this investigation is the intrinsic
interest of the monotreme dentition; this, in fact, provided my original stimulus.

The Monotremata occupy a particularly interesting position in the Class Mammalia:
though specialized in their adaptations to their modes of life, they are undoubtedly
the most primitive existing members of their class, as is evidenced by the numerous
reptilian features which they retain.

The characters of the teeth form the main clues to the interrelationships of the fossil
mammals of the Mesozoic era. As teeth are absent in the adult monotremes it has been
difficult to relate any of the Mesozoic mammals to the living Prototheria. RomER
