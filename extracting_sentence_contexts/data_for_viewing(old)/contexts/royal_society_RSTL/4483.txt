minute Entomostracous Crustacea is well known. Their development is greatly re-
tarded by the want of it ; and the exuviation of their shells, which normally takes
place at short intervals when they have attained their complete form and size (ap-
parently for the purpose of freeing them from the minute plants with which their sur-
face becomes clothed), is much less frequently performed*. With these facts before
us, we can scarcely refrain from suspecting that the deprivation of light may be the
cause of the atrophy of the visual organs in certain animals which pass their whole
lives in complete seclusion from its influence. This condition, which has been long
known to exist in the common Mole, and also in the Proteus anguineus, and which
has also been discovered in the Amblyopsis spelceus, a fish inhabiting the waters of
the Great Cave of Kentucky, has recently been detected in a considerable number of
species of Insects discovered in the very caverns of the Tyrol whose waters afford a
habitat to the Proteus. It may be supposed that the non-development of eyes in all
these animals is a part of their original constitution, and is to be looked upon as an
example of the adaptation of their organisms to the peculiar conditions of their exist-
ence; and such a view cannot at present be positively disproved. But the actual de-
pendence of the nutrition of the visual organs, or (at least) of the nervous apparatus
