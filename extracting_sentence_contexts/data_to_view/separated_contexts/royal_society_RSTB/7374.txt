Its arginine content is smaller
than that of the lymphocyte histone. The difference, although not very large, is certainly
outside the limits of experimental error. The result is, moreover, supported by the fact
that in the purification of the total histone isolated from fowl erythrocyte nuclei, which
has an arginine content (table 1) identical with that of purified fowl thymus histone,
a subsidiary histone with a higher arginine content (table 7) is removed from it. Inci-
dentally, this subsidiary histone is absent from thymocyte and lymphocyte nuclei and
hence represents another example of cell specificity among the histones. Cell specificity
of the basic proteins of cell nuclei has thus been demonstrated to occur between the sperm
and somatic cells in the salmon, and between the erythrocytes and the lymphocytes in
the fowl.
