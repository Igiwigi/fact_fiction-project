For from the colours
we ought to be able to deduce the size of the full-grown drops, and the total quantity
of water which condenses in consequence of the corresponding expansion may be
calculated, With the exceedingly dense fogs with which we are now dealing there
is no doubt that the water which condenses on the walls will be small in quantity

compared with what condenses in the form of drops. From the quantity of water
which separates, and the size of the drops, we may calculate the number, assuming
the water to be equally divided among them. It is assumed here that the cloud-particles are actually liquid drops and not ice-
crystals, in spite of the fact that the condensation begins at temperatures much below
the freezing point, and that the temperature when the particles are full grown is, as
we shall see, also slightly below the freezing point. Let us consider first the quantity of water which separates out in consequence of
an expansion of a given amount. Let us suppose the expansion to be completed
before the drops have grown to more than a very small fraction of their final size, so
that the theoretical lowering of temperature results.
