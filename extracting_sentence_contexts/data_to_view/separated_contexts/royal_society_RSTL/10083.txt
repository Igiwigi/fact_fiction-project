Such experiments afford, however,
even a less 8afe ground for conclusions as to the adult Mammalian heart than do the
experiments upon Frogs' hearts above referred to. The heart of three-day Chick
embryos is but a protoplasmic mass, little differentiated, presenting neither definite
musenlar or nervous tissue, and without any developed controlling extrinsic nerves. From the fact that such a mass of hardly-differentiated embryonic cells contracts more
frequently when warm than when cold, we cannot safely conclude that the adult heart,
vith its fully deyeloped muscular and nervous tissues, and placed under the

governance of nerve centres located outside it in the body, would, if isolated, respond
in like manner to similar temperature changes. While experiment upon the isolated hearts of Frogs, Fishes, and Bird embryos,
combined with the changes in the pulse-rate observed when Mammals are heated or
cooled, have led to a general consensus of opinion among physiologists that gradual
and moderate increases of temperature quicken the Mammalian pulse by direct action
upon the cardiac tissnes, and moderate diminutions of temperature similarly slow the
pulse, the proof that the action of s8uch temperature changes was exerted directly
upon the heart itself did not seem <atisfactory, for the reagons above stated. Henes
the investigation described in the following pages was undertaken,

The method,

The fundamental idea upon which all my work on the isolated Mammalian heart
has been based is to occlude all vessels of the systemic circulation except those
supplying the heart itself, while leaving the pulmonary circulation intact, The heart
and lungs being supplied with blood alone retain their vitality ; all extraneous nerve
centres getting no blood s0on die with the remainder of the animal, Moreover, the
blood supplied to the heart passes through no organ of the body but the lungs, and
in these it undergoes simple and well understood changes ; no sudden chemical
alteration in it due to the products of the abnormal activity or commencing death of
musele, gland, or brain is possible.
