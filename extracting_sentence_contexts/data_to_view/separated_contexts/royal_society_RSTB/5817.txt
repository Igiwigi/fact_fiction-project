Taking the thickness
of the cells as 4u, the total average thickness traversed by the beam is 0-25 mm. Since
on the average a ray passes through 65 cells in 10 metres, screening is bound to occur,
but this does not affect the above argument in any way. The fact that the path of the
ray is not vertical will, of course, increase the thickness traversed. Obviously the number
of cells taken, 27 million per litre, is a major limit. Ordinarily there might be only one-
tenth as many, though LonMaNnn has reported as many as 77-8 million per litre of
Skeletonema costatum found at Kiel, where probably the water was initially richer in
phosphate than in the English Channel.
