sphere’s surface. This was a fortuitous error, in one sense, however, as it prompted a letter (dated
19 August 1892) from the young Demonstrator of Experimental Physics at Thomson’s Cavendish
Laboratory at Cambridge, G. F. C. Searle (1864-1954), who had been working with Thomson since
October 1888. That letter was the beginning of a positive relationship, on both the technical and
human levels, that would last the rest of Heaviside’s life.

In his letter, Searle wrote ‘I quite agree with your solution for the motion of an electrified
point, but I do not understand how it will apply when we deal with a sphere’. Searle went

on to show Heaviside that as long as ‘u*/v" is utterly negligible’ then Heaviside’s field line : =
assumption is permissible, but if ‘y2/v? is not neglected’ then the assumption is not valid. 23
Heaviside received this criticism with good spirits, and from that point on, he certainly had a : a
high opinion of his new acquaintance. The fact that Searle, as a youngster, had been given a tour 14
of the Cavendish laboratory by the great Maxwell himself, surely added to Searle’s bona fides _

in Heaviside’s eyes as well. In 1896, Searle published corrections to Heaviside’s point charge
analysis, arriving at expressions including the same famous factor of //1 — (u2/v2) that appeared
in the Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction hypothesis, indicating that they were probing at the very
edges of relativistic electrodynamics [23].

4. Faster-than-light

An immediate, impossible to overlook implication of the predicted mass variation with speed is
the infinity that occurs at the speed of light. This result is generally interpreted today to mean
that nothing with a non-zero rest mass can travel as fast as light (in a vacuum). Searle studied
