‘8 _ [I was at first inclined to regard these bodies as reproductive elements of Poly-

_ stomella, comparable with the anisospores of Radiolaria, and as I was not then aware
of the mode of reproduction of the microspherie form, it seemed possible that they
Were produced by it. Now that the mode of reproduction of the microspheri ic form
_is known (see Postscript 2) this view becomes untenable, unless it is supposed that
_ the bodies in question belong to yet another phase in the life-history. The more
probable view appears to be that they were not the spores of Polystomella at all, but
| pyere the products of some other organism which had entered the shell of the
_ Polystomella. This is supported by the fact that a considerable amount of proto-
occupied the central chambers of the specimen and showed no indication of
divided up into spores.—March 13, 1895. |

The evidence afforded by the investigation of Polystomella may now be reviewed.

The Microspheric form occurs in various phases of development, both young ar
old specimens having been found (figs. 6 and 7). Numbers of small nuclei a
present, scattered through the protoplasm, but not extending into the te
