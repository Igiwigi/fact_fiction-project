Cotarnimide,
Ci, Hig (CH,) NO, = C, H, (CH) O, + Cy Hy NO,. On trying the experiment it was found impossible to obtain anything but tarry masses :
the fact that methyl-normeconin was not obtained would tend to show that the former
reaction takes place, the normeconin immediately becoming decomposed ; the cotarnine,
however, could not be got sufficiently free from tar for analysis. Similarly, with oxidizing agents either of the following reactions appears probable :â€”

Monomethyl-nornarcotine, Noropianic acid. Cotarnine,
Cy Hig(CHz) NO; + O = C, Hg O, + Cy Hyg (CH) NO,,
or
Methyl-noropianic acid.
