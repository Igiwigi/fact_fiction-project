The tissue being of a mucilaginous nature swells readily, and under these cireum-
stances the threads are easily broken up into rows of granules.

The end walls, at first horizontal, become oblique owing to the unequal growth in
length of the cell (fig. 9, Plate 32), and the older the tissues, the more oblique the
wall is found to become, so that in the hypocotyl, to be described later, the end walls
have been dragged out to such a length that they appear almost parallel to the
side walls (vide p. 99).

The end walls are richly provided with threads, which in longitudinal section
usually present a somewhat confused appearance of threads and dots overlying one
another and intermingling, owing to the fact that the walls slope and undulate in
‘a. such a manner that a preparation which shows a portion of the threads in accurate
longitudinal section cuts the remainder obliquely. (Fig. 9, Plate 32.)

The Secondary Phloem.—The structure ot the secondary phloem may now be
described. Radial rows of sieve tubes, together with a few medullary-ray cells,
3 compose this tissue.

The thicker walled cells appear in transverse section, similar to adult sieve tubes,
and agree with them also in possessing numerous threads on the radial walls. Only a
few small sieve plates or groups of threads occur on the tangential walls, so that the
radial communication which is possible in the outer primary zone, does not take
place here to any extent (fig. 9, Plate 32), but in longitudinal section the phloem
