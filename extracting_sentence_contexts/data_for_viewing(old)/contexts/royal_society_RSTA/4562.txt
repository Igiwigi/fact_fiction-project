whereby novel solutions to problems are the products of single individuals [25]. Regardless of : Sy
learning mode, almost every novel solution is an incremental change to previous cultural habits a
and existing technologies as opposed to something that appears de novo. aed

Second, culture is cumulative [26], by which we mean that one generation does things in 22
a certain way, and the next generation, instead of starting from scratch, does them in more or : xs

modified version, which then persists across generations until further changes are made [23,27]. : =
Cultural learning is thus characterized by the so-called ‘ratchet effect’, in which modifications D&

and improvements stay in a population until further changes ratchet things up again [28,29].
The rate of innovation—slow as, say, among Australian Aborigines or fast as among the most
technologically sophisticated nation—is irrelevant; the fact is, culture is cumulative.

Third, cultural behaviour is at times driven by the pay-off environment [30]. In other words,
humans have evolved a utility function that enables them to respond adaptively to different
ecological conditions by estimating, not necessarily consciously, the cost/benefit ratio of different
potential behaviours [20,31]. The view of behaviour as a learned, deeply historical phenomenon
can appear to be at odds with the view of behaviour as a pay-off-maximizing response to present
conditions, but in reality they are simply ends of a continuum that defines human behaviour
[32-34]. Any particular case will fall somewhere in between.

Until recently, humans did not typically need to overcome problems such as climate change
in a single generation. Climates changed, but culture, working over longer periods of time
and on small groups of people, solved most problems through simple adjustments made
