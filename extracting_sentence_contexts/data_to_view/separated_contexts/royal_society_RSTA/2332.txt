mixed-crystallisation effects. On the other hand, the fact that (100) is the spot most
free from dispersion points to an arrangement in which the dispersion is confined to a
real or imaginary cylinder, the radii of which are the normals to the planes (100). It is
exactly this distribution which has already been found for ramie fibre. *
