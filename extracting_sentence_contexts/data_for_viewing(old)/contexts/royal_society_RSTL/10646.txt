that the lesions were confined to the cortex aud medullary fibres of the hippocampal
and inferior temporo-sphenoidal region.

In Experiment XVIII. anzsthesia followed the legion immediately, and the animal
was killed before any secondary changes could be developed. The sections of the
hemisphere show that the lesion was strictly confined to the hippocampal and lower
temporo-sphenoidal region (figs. 97-102).

In reference to lesions of the temporal lobe not specially invading the hippocampal
region, Experiment 14 is of importance. Tn this case the region of the middle and
inferior temporo-sphenoidal convolutions was disorganised without any indications of
tactile anzsthesia. Some extension of the primary lesion occurred secondarily, but
whether any anzsthesia resulted was not observed. The fact of importance is that
the primary lesions were without discoverable effect, on tactile sensibility.

In Experiment 26 also, though the lower temporo-sphenoical region was destroyed,

the hippocampal region only partially involved, there was only slight and transitory
pairment of tactile sensibility on the opposite side.

These, as well as other similar facts narrated, 8erve to show that the lesions of the
Jower temporo-sphenoidal region which are necessarily made in attempts to destroy the
