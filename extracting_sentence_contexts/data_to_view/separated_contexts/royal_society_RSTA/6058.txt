turns out that the vacuum energy can actually escape such a fate, as we will show here, after it is
properly renormalized [57,58]. The vacuum is in fact the most fundamental notion of QFT. Thus,
a correct description of the CCP using the quantum vacuum and the machinery of QFT should be
the most desirable approach to tackle the big CC conundrum from first principles. One expects that any sensible proposal should largely preserve the concordance ACDM
model, which is formulated in the context of the Friedman—Lemaitre—-Robertson—Walker (FLRW)
framework and is deeply ingrained in the general relativity (GR) paradigm.
