Thus, the
CO2/H2 couple can be used as a Cl synthon, allowing for sustainable processes across the
chemical value chain [4]. Most significantly, this can open up novel synthetic pathways following
the green chemistry principles even in conventional Hz sources [5]. Thus, the development of
such a catalytic process does not require renewable energy sources as a necessary prerequisite to
be implemented, but may in fact facilitate their introduction by providing additional economic
outlets for the system-inherent overcapacities.


2. Recent progress and illustrative examples

The reduction sequence of CO2 by Hz addition and H2O elimination can follow two distinct
mechanistic principles. Firstly, the reverse water gas shift reaction (rWGS) can convert carbon
dioxide and hydrogen to carbon monoxide and water.
