So far, we have assumed that the Price equation is meant to
be used in a theoretical context. This is also consistent with
most of the literature. In this section, we will consider what
happens when the Price equation is applied to data. There
are a few reasons to do that.

The first is that Price himself was not entirely clear about
whether the equation was to be used for deriving hypotheses
from theory assumptions, or for testing them using data (see
[1, p. 520) and [3, p. 416]). The second reason is that the Price

equation, when applied to data can, in fact, have a meaningful (iii) Model B plus noise
interpretation when the data are generated by Model A plus There are, however, also other model specifications. One
noise. The third and most important reason is that both Price alternative model specification is Model B plus noise

and later users of his equation borrow concepts and terminol-

ogy from statistics, seemingly suggesting, or at least allowing wisa+b pte gre, 1=1,...,m.

for the thought, that the role these concepts play in the Price If we assume that the data are generated by this model, we
