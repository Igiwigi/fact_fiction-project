During chronic infections of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the
immune response is dominated by the action of antibody-secreting plasma
B-cells [7]. However, most of the time, this machinery is not enough to control
or clear the virus. The reason can be identified in the extremely rapid evolution
of the virus escaping immune adaptation [8-10] and the fact that regions of the
viral structure sensitive to B-cell targeting are made inaccessible [11,12]. Never-
theless, an effective immune response can instead occur naturally in 10-20% of

bodies (bNAbs) [13-15]. This promising discovery is the basis of the search
