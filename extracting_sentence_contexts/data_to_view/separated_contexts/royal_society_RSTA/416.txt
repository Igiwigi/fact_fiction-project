fulminate is not sensitized by grit. (ii) The fact that even hard grit such as carborundum has no marked effect on the
initiators, under the conditions of the test, until hard surfaces are likewise present, supports
the previous conclusion that grit acts on hard surfaces by forming hot spots of a sufficiently
high temperature to activate grains of initiator in the neighbourhood (cf. part III (1)). (iii) The fact that lead azide is markedly more grit sensitive than fulminate appears to
be due to its superior ‘pick up’ from the decomposition of individual grains, in building up
detonation.
