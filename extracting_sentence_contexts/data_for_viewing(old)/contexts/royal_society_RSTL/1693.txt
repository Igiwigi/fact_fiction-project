The results of Sir WiLL1aM HERSCHEL's observations from
1779 to 1784, were published in two Catalogues in the Phi-
losophical Transactions for 1782 and 1785, and consist of
descriptions and measures of 702 double and triple stars.
The labour of re-examination was undertaken and executed
by him in 1801, 2, gand 4, after a lapse of twenty years; and
the changes observed or suspected in them were recorded in
two other papers, published in the volumes for 1802 and 1804.
It was to be naturally expected that, owing to the imperfec-
tion of the micrometers with which many of the earlier mea-
sures, especially those of 1779 and 1780, were performed,
and the novelty of the subject, many errors would have crept
in; and that a verification of the facts, by farther observation,
would at all events be highly desirable. Accordingly, in the


distances and positions of g80 double and triple stars, &c. g

year 1816, a second re-examination of the measures was en-
tered on by his Son (one of the authors of this paper), and
some progress made in it; several of the results of which
will be found attached to the measures in the following pages:
The instruments in Mr. SouTH's possession being peculiarly
adapted to the purpose, a similar idea had also occurred to
him ; and, at his suggestion, it was determined to undertake
