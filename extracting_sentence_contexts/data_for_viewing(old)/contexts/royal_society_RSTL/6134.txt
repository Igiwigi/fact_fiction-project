the tube began to be discontinuous, till at last only single separate discharges occurred; finally, the current
entirely ceased to traverse the tube.‚Äù TI have 8ince repeated the experiment in tubes carefully prepared by
Dr, FRASKLAND, continuing the discharges for several hours, but without obtaining this result.

sides of the vacuum-tubes; and PLUCKER has shown that it arranges itself between the
poles of a powerful electro-magnet in the line of magnetic force. In this communica-
tion T have shown not only the appearance of the direction of a force as evinced when
passing through a narrow orifice, but that wherever this discharge impinges heat is
evolved. At present T do not alter the opinion that I ventured to offer, that the dark
band may be due to interference; but the new facts which have been elicited in relation
to the negative discharge require a further, and probably an extended experimental
investigation, and I am at present engaged in endeavouring to test the accuracy of the
; opinion I have offered, by means of apparatus now in the progress of construction.
107. 1 am aware that in this paper IT have entered somewhat more fully into detail,
when describing my experiments, than is usnal in communications to the Royal Society.
Sut I have been induced to be thus minute, as the subject is novel; and by explain-
Jag some of my experiments in detail, it may afford to others the means of examining
Airectly, and poxsibly more correctly, into the nature of that mysterious force which we
=Rlenominate Electricity, and which is in many respects 80 nearly related to heat, mag-
Hetigm, and other forces, each being, as Mr. Grove has long since shown, convertible
Einto each other; while the fact that a vacuum 50 perfect can be obtained in a closed
