If two or more are present we
get the other varieties. In combinations, each pigment retains the distribution it has
in the corresponding simple form. These facts suggest that we have here a genetical phenomenon in which the
presence or absence of each pigment is an independent heritable quality. There is no
doubt that the colour of a variety is inherited, at least during the common asexual
reproduction, and that under natural conditions it is not due to accidental environ-
mental influences such as the consumption of a particular food. Metridium appears
to feed on coarse plankton (Stephenson 1935).
