figure for “ carbon unaccounted for,” only relatively small amounts of products other
than gluconic acid could be isolated.

B. Treatment of Filtrate and Washings.—The filtrate and washings were freed
from lead by means of H,S and then evaporated im vacuo to a syrup which did
not crystallise even after long standing. It was, therefore, re-dissolved in 1 litre of
water and the residual glucose, amounting to about 37 gm., fermented with 40 gm. of
pure yeast. After three days the yeast was removed by filtration, the filtrate cleaned
with basic lead acetate, and the filtrate from the lead precipitate freed from lead by
means of H.S and then evaporated in vacuo. Even now the resultant syrup refused to
crystallise, and the explanation was found in the fact that the syrup contained con-
siderable quantities of sodium acetate. This was removed by estimating the acetic
acid in a small portion of the syrup and then distilling the remainder in vacuo with
the calculated amount of sulphuric acid necessary to decompose the sodium acetate
present. After removal of the acetic acid, an estimation of the carbon present in solution
gave an amount only half (24-8 gm.) of what was expected from the balance sheet,
i.e., 48-6 gm. of carbon should be present as “ carbon unaccounted for ” in one-third
, of the metabolism solution. This supports the view already expressed that part of
the “ carbon unaccounted for ” is gluconic acid lactone, which by the method adopted
will have been isolated as calcium gluconate.

The acetic acid-free solution was now evaporated, when considerable quantities of
pure sodium sulphate were separated. The resulting syrup was then fractionally
