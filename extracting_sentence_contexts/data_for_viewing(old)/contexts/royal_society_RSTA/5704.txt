The effective distance is a network metric introduced in [29]. Given a network of flows between
origin—destination pairs, and a given origin—destination pair i = (0,4), where o and d are connected


via a link, the effective distance is defined as
dj =(1—logP;) <1, (4.4)

where P; is the fraction of trips going from o to d relative to all trips leaving node o. Note that
the measure is generally asymmetric as Pj(o,a) 4 Pi=(d,o), reflecting the asymmetry of real world
travel. Note also that d; is dimensionless and unaffected by the magnitude of the mobility flow.

More in general, to account for the fact that not all pairs of cities are connected via a
link, the authors of [29] defined the effective distance between any pairs of network nodes
as follows. Assume I" = {11,12,...,n,} is an ordered path from any two nodes 11 to ny and
wr) = ni Pnj.1n;, then the distance of that path is defined as

AW) =L — log W(L). (4.5)
The effective distance, Dj(o,d), is then the path that minimizes the distance

Dim = min MD), (4.6)

which is equivalent to computing the shortest path in a network with weights computed from the
effective distance (equation (4.4)) plus one.
