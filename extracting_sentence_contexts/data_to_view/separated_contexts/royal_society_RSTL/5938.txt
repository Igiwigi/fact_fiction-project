The only exact formule hitherto published for the work performed by the steam on
the piston, viz. those contained in a paper on thermo-dynamics by the author of this
paper, which was received by the Royal Society in 1853 and published in the Philoso-
phical Transactions for 1854, and those contained in a paper by Professor CLavgvs,
published in PoGGexDoReFP's © Annalen * for 1856 (the 8ame results having been inde-
pendently arrived at in both papers), are adapted to cylinders without steamackets. It is obviously desirable that exact formulze should be deduced from the principles of
thermo-dynamics, for the action of steam in jacketed cylinders also; and the present
paper is intended to supply that want. In the first place, those fundamental equations
of thermo-dynamics, to which it is afterwards necessary to refer, are briefly recapitulated:
then the exact formulz for the action of steam, and the corresponding expenditure of
heat, in jacketed cylinders are deduced from them, and exemplified by numerical
results :—then is explained a convenient approximation to the exact formulze, founded
on the facts, that within the limits usual in practice, the pressure of saturated steam
varies nearly as the seventeenth power of the sixteenth root of its density ; and that the
expenditure of heat in a jacketed cylinder is nearly equal to fifteen and a half times the
product of the initial pressure and volume of the steam :—and, lastly, are given
examples of the application of the formulez to the engines of three steam-yessels recently
experimented on by the author, and a comparison of the results of the formule with
those of experiment. Summary of previously-known Principles and Formule. The following is the GENERAL EqQuaTION of THERMO-DYNAMICS which has been known
since 1849-50 *;—
H=ſtde: i eo  ESTON

H denotes the guantity of heat which must be communicated to a mass of matter in
order to make it undergo a given series of changes of volume and elastic pressure,
expressed in foot-pounds of energy, of which 772 are equivalent to one degree of FAHREN-
HEIT in one pound of water, as proved by Mr.
