Such explanations as have been afforded to explain the
ductility or otherwise of metals and other crystalline substances have rested on the
form of the atomic arrangement rather than on the spacing of the atoms or unit
dimensions of the lattice. In this respect there is a distinct difference between iron, which has the body-centred
form of cubic structure, and nickel, copper, or aluminium, which have a face-centred
cubic form of structure. This fact, however, does not prevent iron having excellent
ductility at ordinary temperature. For atomic structure to be at the root of the
question, it is necessary, therefore, to suppose that closer approach of the atoms can,
on the one hand, in some way destroy ductility, and, on the other, improve it. The matter is, too, further complicated by the fact that manganese steel, which has
the same face-centred cubic structure as all those other metals and alloys which still
retain considerable ductility in liquid hydrogen or even improve, is rendered brittle.
