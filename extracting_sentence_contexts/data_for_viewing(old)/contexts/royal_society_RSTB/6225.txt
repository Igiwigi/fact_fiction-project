Three similar cages, started at the same time and kept under identical conditions,
produced eleven, six, and one puparia respectively. The period of gestation is
about a fortnight, which corresponds to about seven puparia per 100 female-days,
if one pregnancy immediately succeeds another. But frequently the birth-rate is
as low as two per 100 female-days. It seems easier to believe that some of the
females are sterile, and that others are producing larve at fortnightly intervals, than
that they are all intermittently reproductive. There are other grounds for thinking
that sterility is common. The first puparium in a cage of tachinoides is generally
produced between the 16th and 19th day. But one must wait till the 30th or 40th
day before the total number of puparia is equal to the number of females in the cage.
It is more probable that some of the females have produced two puparia by that
time, than that the reproductive life of some of them begins very late. The results
obtained with Glossina submorsitans are essentially the same. From these facts one
may conclude that a proportion of the females of both species are probably sterile.
The matter is of considerable importance to the laboratory worker, and requires
fuller study.

The conditions under which stocks of Glossina can be maintained in the laboratory
are now beginning to be clear ;_ the limiting conditions of temperature and humidity
are discussed in the present paper. Much remains to be discovered with regard to
sexual physiology. We do not know what proportion of males is optimal (see
Ports, 1933, for Glossina morsitans in Tanganyika), and how many females may be
kept in a cage of a given size without interference with nutrition and without
causing abortion. We have shown that conception does not occur during the first
day of adult life, but it is not yet known whether this is due to sexual immaturity
