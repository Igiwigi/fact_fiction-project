(b) Sweat donation

Methods and results of the sweat donation are presented in detail in
the electronic supplementary material (figures S1— S3, tables S1-
$3). In brief, axillary sweat was sampled on cotton pads from
both armpits of 17 women and 17 men. The donors first attended
the aggression induction session, and 1-16 days later, a non-
emotional control session. Within the aggression condition, partici-
pants were exposed to the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm
(PSAP [25,26]). Within this game, the participants’ task is to collect
as many points as possible via button presses, while a fictitious
opponent simultaneously is stealing these points. Participants can
choose between three behavioural strategies, one of which is related
to overt aggressive behaviour against their opponent. In the control
session, the PSAP was replaced by a construction computer game.

Almost all donors (30 out of 34) showed overt aggressive be-
haviour during the PSAP game. In addition, donors reported a
stronger increase of anger during the aggression condition than
during the control condition (p<0.001; none of the other basic
emotions increased during the aggression condition). Accordingly,
their salivary testosterone levels rose during the aggression
condition (p=0.05). Donors’ mean baseline-corrected heartrate
