4, In other cases the parenchymatous cells are seen lying in a cup or hollow formed
by the epithelial cells, and in which the flattened epithelial cells, or the membrane, SCPa-
rating the parenchymatous cells from the cavity of the vesicle have given way, thus placing
the parenchymatous cells in direct communication with the contents of the vesicle
(figs. 12,6, 13,6, & 14, 6), In this, as in all other situations described, the parenchy-
matous cells may be single or seyeral together, apparently in a common cavity.

Lastly, rounded cavities or cups, similar to those shown in figs. 12, 13, & 14, whose
walls are formed by flattened epithelial cells, and which communicate freely with the
vesicle, may be frequently seen in an empty condition.

'The simple and, as it appears to me, the only reasonable interpretation of the above
facts is this: â€”The parenchymatous cells, either in groups or singly, lie originally in the
intervesicular tisse, outside the epithelial walls of the vesicles. They begin to make
their way into a neighbouring vesicle by pressing on the epithelial wall of one with which
they are in contact. This pressure exerted by a parenchymatous cell canses the epi-
thelial cells to lose their quadrilateral outline, and to present a more or less triangular
or crescentic appearance. The pressure continuing, the epithelial cells become flattened,
and finally either separate at once (figs. 13, 6 & 14,6) or first become reduced to a thin
membrane, which then gives way (fig. 12,5). In either case the result is the sxame, The
parenchymatous cell is placed in direct communication with the contents of the vesicle,
and can escape into the cavity of the 8ame. And that it does 80 is shown by the fact
that these cups or hollows formed by flattened epithelial cells are frequently seen in an
empty condition, having lost their parenchymatous cells.
