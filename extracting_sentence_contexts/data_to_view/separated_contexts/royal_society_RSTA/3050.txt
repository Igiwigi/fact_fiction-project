Insurance programmes, for instance, work best where risk is predictable
and claims are spread out over time and extent of severity. When uncertainty soars and claims
concentrate, insurance markets crash. There is also the issue of morality: at what point does after-
the-fact aid become simply a mockery of justice, a way of ‘buying off’ people because the real
work of harm prevention seemed too difficult or inconvenient at the time? For a loss-and-damage plan to work, it must be capable of carrying the load, the load being
whatever minimal standards of fairness and coverage that morality and political consensus
require.” But if residual risk climbs too high, it will fall short of even the most basic expectations. For that reason, it is important to examine the projected load of residual risk under chosen climate
scenarios.
