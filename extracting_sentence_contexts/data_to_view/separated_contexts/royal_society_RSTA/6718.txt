It is worth stressing this point, as it gets at once to the origin of the confusion which
exists on this subject. If one desires a picture of what is happening, EE and FF may be
regarded as measures of the tendency of the corresponding random forces to produce fluc-
tuations in current and deflexion respectively. The form of the numerator of (19) then
indicates, as might be intuitively expected, that the tendencies of the two random forces
to impart mean energy to the coil are indeed additive; but the fact that the total damping
term, which is also additively constructed, appears in the denominator implies that the
resultant mean potential energy stored in the suspension is determined by the ratio of the
total tendency to deflect to the total damping. The tendency of each source of fluctuation
to produce a deflexion is automatically related to the damping that it introduces; the
relation ensures that the mean energy stored in the suspension cannot be changed by adding
new sources of fluctuation, providing that each source operates at the same temperature,
and that the equipartition principle holds. As a concrete example, the admission of air to
a previously evacuated galvanometer does not change its r.m.s. fluctuation, since the tendency
of the molecular bombardment to increase the r.m.s. deflexion is exactly counterbalanced by
the viscous air-damping automatically introduced.
