the most healthy appearance, there was an increase upon the quantity of nitrogen
contained in the seeds of nearly fifty per cent.

Seeds of cress during vegetation increased their quantity of nitrogen forty-one per
cent. when the plants were kept under a temperature varying with shade and sun-
shine from 60? to 84%, The experiments upon the seeds of the turnip, an important
plant in an agricultural point of view, (about one half of which germinated,) shows
thai the nitrogen which was derived from the atmosphere was more than that which
was contained in the seed. In all these experiments we have the quickness of the
growth of the young plants proportional to the quantity of nitrogen present when
compared with 1000 parts of carbon in the same.

With these facts before us, we are enabled to account for plants not continuing to
grow 80 well in pure oxygen gas as in atmospheric air; and by following up the in-

quiry in other departments, we see the wisdom of the all-wise Contriver in consti-

tuting an atmosphere with a decided preponderance of nitrogen and a much smaller
proportion of oxygen.

Finding that plants under different circumstances of growth differ in the relative
quantity of nitrogen which they contain, as well as in the other elements which enter
