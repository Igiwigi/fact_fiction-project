and when the responses do occur they are not of 80 suggestive a character as those
which I have thought ib worth while 80 fully to deseribe. Nevertheless, even in the
covered-eyed Medusz well marked, though comparatively brief, displays of artificial
rhythm may often be observed as the result of constant chemical stimulation. Thus,
for instance, in the case of Aurelia, if the paralyzed umbrella be immersed in a solu-
tion of glycerine (10 to 20 per cent.) a few rhythmic pulsations of normal rate are
usually given, but shortly after these pulsations occur the tissne begins to go into a
tetanus, which progressively and rapidly becomes more and more pronounced until it
ends in violent tonic spasm. So that the history of events really regembles that of
Sarsia under similar cireumstances, except that the stage of artificial rhythm which
inaugurates the spasm is of a character comparatively less pronounced.

(m.) Thus far, then, I have detailed all the facts which I have been able to collect
with reference to the phenomena of artificial rhythm as produced by different kinds of
constant, stimulation. Tb will nob be forgotten that the interest attaching to these
facts arises from the bearing which they have on the theory of natural rhythm. My

belief is that hitherto the theory of rhythm as due to ganglia has attributed far too
much importance to the ganglionie as distinguished from the contractile tissnes, and I
have founded this belief principally on the facts which have been already stated and
which certainly prove, at least, this much : that after the removal of their centres of
