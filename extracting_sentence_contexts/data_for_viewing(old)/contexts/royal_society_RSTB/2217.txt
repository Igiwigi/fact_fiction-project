increased pressure, and so form intumescences.

With regard to the possible meaning and function of the outgrowths, the position
and structure of the outgrowths themselves, and the structure of the bundle-endings
in the leaf teeth, offer a suggestion. In a normal leaf the median vein in each tooth
(and frequently some of its branches) dilates at its end, owing to an increase in the
number of tracheides accompanying the vessels. These tracheides, some of which
resemble transfusion tissue, are in contact with the small number of chlorophyll-con-
taining cells which here lie between the vascular tissue and the epidermis, but there
is no specialised epithema. In the epidermis round the apex are stomata communi-
cating with air spaces. The whole structure resembles a water gland, and suggests
an organ which at least promotes transpiration, if it does not also secrete drops of
water. It also throws light upon the fact that the formation of outgrowths often
begins on the leaf teeth, since, transpiration being checked by a damp atmosphere,
water would tend to collect at the point where it is normally most. abundantly
discharged.

In order to determine whether the plant secreted drops of water, a healthy branch
was placed in water in a U-tube, into which mercury was poured, the whole being
covered with a bell-jar standing in water. There were five leaves on the branch,
which was left in a laboratory with a north aspect on August 22. No water was
seen on the leaves till the 25th, when there was a large drop on the apex of the
third leaf. On the 27th there was another drop on the second leaf. By the 28th the
formation of outgrowths had begun, and the experiment was removed to the tropical
pit to hasten their formation. In two days the youngest leaf was thickly covered on
