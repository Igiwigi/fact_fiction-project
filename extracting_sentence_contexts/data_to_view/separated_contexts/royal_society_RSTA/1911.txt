(E.W.) Thus the susceptibilities of the various basic rocks which are associated with the
Mount Sorrel granite are not such that any magnetic effects due to the normal
granite would be materially increased by the presence of the basic rocks. In fact,
the basic marginal granite and the hornblende-diorite have actually lower suscepti-
bilities than the typical granite. Tn all these granitic rocks the accessory iron-ores are entirely in the form of
magnetite, with the possible exception of the basic marginal granite in which some
of the primary iron-ores may be sulphides. The presence of this magnetite readily
accounts for the high susceptibilities of some of the rocks.
