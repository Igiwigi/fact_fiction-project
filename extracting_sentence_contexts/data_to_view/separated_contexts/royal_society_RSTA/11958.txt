Yttrium and scandium, in solutions of their chlorides, each yield a line spectrum,
with a group of bands in the red and orange region, when submitted to the action of
a condensed spark. From the foregoing facts, and from the descriptions of spectra
which here follow, it will be seen that several metallic elements emit banded spectra. Characteristic Flame Spectra of Elements emitted at High Temperatures. I.
