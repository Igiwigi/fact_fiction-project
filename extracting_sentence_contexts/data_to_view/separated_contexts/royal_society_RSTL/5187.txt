Hence it necessarily follows, that if the purpurine of WoLey and STRECKER
be not found as such among the products of the fermentation of rubian, it must consist
of a mixture of two or more of those products. Now I have mentioned in the first part of this paper, that though alizarine and
verantine are both perfectly insoluble in boiling alum liquor when acted on sepa-
rately, yet that when a mixture of both is employed, the mixture is found to be
soluble in alum liquor with the colour characteristic of purpurine. Hence I con-
cluded that purpurine is in fact a mixture of those two substances, a view with
which all that is mentioned regarding purpurine completely coincides, I may mention

meidentally, that in making this experiment it is necessary to treat the verantine
with a little dilute nitric acid, in order to destroy the alizarine which usually accom-
panies it, and then to remove the acid by washing with water before employing it,
and that it generally succeeds best when a large excess of alizarine is used.
