As an antidote to this, many
have argued for the invigoration of noisy, confrontational protest to cut through and open up
the technocratic-administrative closure of politics (think Donald Trump’s ‘drain the swamp’,
Greta Thunberg’s ‘climate strike’, Extinction Rebellion’s ‘non-violent direct action’ or Hong Kong
residents’ reaction to the ‘extradition bill’). Others see hope in quieter forms of resistance. For
example, it has been argued [11,12] that the post-political should not be positioned as a ‘matter
of fact’ as it obscures the opportunities and successes of more sustainable experiments and the
different possibilities they make real. Others suggest there is not enough consideration of the
‘feelings, passions, hopes, fears and beliefs’ that accompany such efforts [13]. Taking the above as a foundation, this paper examines how an experiment with more
resilient water infrastructure politicized centralized water management, focusing, in particular,
on a stormwater re-use ‘third-pipe’ system at a large residential development in Auckland,
New Zealand.
