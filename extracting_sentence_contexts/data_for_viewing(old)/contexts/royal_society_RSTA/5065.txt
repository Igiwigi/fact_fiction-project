Analytical solutions at the atomic level for moving cracks were first found by Slepyan. His
original calculations applied to out-of-plane (mode III) cracks in an infinite square lattice [17].
Slepyan and co-workers then generalized the solutions to in-plane (mode I) cracks in an infinite
square lattice [18]. Many additional solutions due to Slepyan are found in [19].

Additional solutions for cracks in a finite strip formed from a triangular lattice were found by
Marder & Gross [20]. This paper also considers linear and nonlinear instabilities of the solutions.
Many additional observations on the experimental implications of the solutions in discrete lattices
are contained in [21].

In all these analytical solutions, the central quantity obtained from the analytical methods is a
relationship between the external load applied to make a crack move and the speed v at which
the crack travels. In fact, the speed v of the crack enters the theory as an input parameter, and
the calculations give the load as an output. For subsonic cracks, one can equivalently say that one
obtains Kj(v), the stress intensity factor as a function of crack speed. For supersonic cracks, the
end result is the external system strain ey, as a function of crack speed [14].

The theory provides more than just this relation. In principle, the theory makes it possible to
find the behaviour of every atom as a function of time for a crack moving in steady state. This
information is relatively easy to obtain for cracks moving in anti-plane shear [20]. However, for
two-dimensional cracks where atoms move freely in the plane, the expressions are so lengthy


that to our knowledge no one has completed the process of extracting analytically the motion of 3 |
every atom.
