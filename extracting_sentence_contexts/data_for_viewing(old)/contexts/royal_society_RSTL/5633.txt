.80 MR. LUBBOCK'S ACCOUNT OF THE TWO METHODS OF REPRODUCTION

has it been determined whether they also are agamic, or whether the stimulus of impreg-
nation is necessary to bring them to maturity.

The agamic reproduction of Daphnia has not, indeed, been sufficiently appreciated in
the different essays which have recently appeared on this subject, and M. DE QUATREPAGES
even $ays, in an essay on ©* Les Metamorphoses*,” © Des cinq classes composant le s0us-
embranchement des Annel6s supcrieurs, ou Annel6s & pieds articul6s, les insectes seuls
paraissent 8e reproduire par g6n6agenese: ou n'a du moins encore rien observ6 de
semblable chez les Myriapodes, les Arachnides, les Crustac6s, ou les Cirrhipedes.”

The fact, however, rests upon snch excellent evidence, that I need not here do more
than refer to the observations already mentioned, which are fully confirmed by my own
experience, and which may easily be repeated by any naturalist who has still some linger-
ing doubts upon the subject.

I propose now to describe,—

First. The male organs.

Secondly. The formation of the ephippium and the ephippial eggs.

Thirdly. The formation of the common or agamic eggs.
