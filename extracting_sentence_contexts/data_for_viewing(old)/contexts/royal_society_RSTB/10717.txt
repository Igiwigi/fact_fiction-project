bitionâ€™ is that muscles that are not actively involved in
producing a movement are inhibited during the movement.
Surround inhibition can be demonstrated with TMS and in
focal hand dystonia, it has been shown that surround inhi-
bition is deficient [92-94]. This loss of selectivity in muscle
activation has been demonstrated even when patients ima-
gined making specific movements [95]. The loss of
inhibition in dystonia is also associated with a delay in the
ability to inhibit preplanned responses and patients required
longer warning times than healthy controls to be able to do so
[96]. It has been suggested that some of the sensory deficits
such as increased spatial [97] and temporal [98] discrimi-
nation thresholds may reflect deficient inhibition. In fact,
recent neurophysiological evidence has shown that increased
somatosensory temporal discrimination thresholds in dysto-
nia are related to reduced activity of inhibitory circuits
within the primary somatosensory cortex [99,100]. These def-
icits and impairment of sensorimotor integration [101,102] in
dystonia, as well as the increased plasticity, may all result
from the loss of inhibition that could itself be due to a
reduced number of inhibitory interneurons [103]. The latter
hypotheses require verification in future investigations.
