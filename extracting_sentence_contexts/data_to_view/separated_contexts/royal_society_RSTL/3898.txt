Below the second diaphragm is another capacious chamber, which we
must consider as a stomach, since digestion evidently commences in it, and it opens
into the intestine.

120. The mastar, as I have above stated, is wholly wanting ; the dental apparatus,
which is very small, evidently springing from the common paries of the stomach,
just below the second diaphragm. That this absence of the masfar is real, and not
illusive, is proved by the facts, that the [yfusoria 8wallowed pass into the Stomach,
where they accumulate in its wide cavity; that the jaws are Seen to act on one and
another, according as they come within reach ; and that, after such action, they pass
off again into the same cavity, to undergo another mastication, when chance again
brings them within reach of the teeth.

121. From the ventral side of the ample crop that precedes the stomach, there
Springs, in F, ornata, a perpendicular membrane, or veil (fig. 79), extending partly
across the cavity*. This is free, except at the vertical edge, by which it is attached
to the side of the chamber; and being ample, and of great delicacy, it continually
floats and waves from side to side.
