Geological Society, has
given a minute description of the site. and external characters
of the Newry pitch-stone. I shall transcribe. it, previous to
laying before the,-Royal Society. my. own. observations. I do
s0 with, more. satisfaction,-as we, in, general agree; in fact,
scarcely two. specimens are. exactly the same, although con-
tiguous to. each other in the vein ; some being compact, some
thin\slaty, some olive, and some leek-green ; some $0: disin-
tegrated, particularly when exposed to the air, as to be friable
between the fingers, while others retain, their gloss, consis=-
tency, and colour, with much tenacity, although they all fall
at length into rhomboidal fragments. I may add also, that
while some are quite porphyritic, others have but a few specks
of felspar on their surface,
