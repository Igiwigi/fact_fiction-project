are many considerable oscillations of the aqueous column which are totally lost
in the mercurial, and will prove that much curious information with regard to
atmospheric changes might be derived from a long-continued series of such
observations. The most important result, however, and that which alone would have amply
repaid all the labour expended upon the subject, is the fact pointed out by
the observations of Mr. Hupsox, that the water-barometer precedes by one
hour the barometer of half-inch bore, and the latter the mountain barometer
of 0:15-inch bore by the same interval, in their indications of the horary
oscillations ; showing that while philosophers are disputing about the hours
of the maxima and minima, much depends upon the construction of the in-
struments observed ; and proving the necessity, which I long ago pointed out,
of making these delicate observations with instraments which have been com-
pared with accurate and known standards. This comparative sluggishness
of the mercurial barometer, when compared with the water, also proves that
the difference between the two, when reduced by calculation of their specific
gravities to the same expression, can only at times approximatively determine
the elasticity of the included vapour ; and that snch determination must always
be liable to a small error from this circumstance. Should the Council of the Society hereafter come to the conclusion that
there is enough of interest in the subject to induce them to prosecute it further,
I am of opinion that the water-barometer might be reboiled and resealed with-
out much risk ; and I think that if a stratum of oil of four or five inches depth
were afterwards poured upon the surface of the water, there would be little
risk of the air again insinuating itself within it.
