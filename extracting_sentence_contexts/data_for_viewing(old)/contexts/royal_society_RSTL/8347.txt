liquid below; immediate turbidity ensued. The flasks were then placed beside their
companions of the first set.

Not one of these ten flasks germinated ; at the end of two months they were still
barren. Now this result was strictly conformable to the view that the effect of the
alkali was to increase the power of survivance of the germs, but it was wholly uncon-
formable to the alternative view. According to the former view, the germs contained
in the infusions were destroyed by the preliminary boiling, and no subsequent addition
of alkali could, of course, restore their vitality. But on the opposing theory there was
no reason why the alkali should not have been equally effective in promoting germi-
nation, whether added before or after the short preliminary boiling *.

* In fact this was 80. Tt will be remembered that in preparing the hay-infusions they were first made yery

By carrying the experiments a step further it was shown that, although the contents
of the flasks had not acquired the power to germinate, they had acquired the property
of enabling freshly introduced germs to survive a boiling heat; for when the flasks
were unplugged and infected with ordinary air or water and then replugged and boiled
five minutes, their contents in every instance germinated in a few days.
