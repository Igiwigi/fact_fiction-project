But, as pointed out by M. DeseReTz, the
existence of the melted ice and the partial destruction of the yessel complicate and in a
: great measure inyalidate the results. Indeed, in some respects, ice is the worst substance
which could be choxsen, on account of the distortion of the results due to the great latent
heat of water and the 8mall specific heats of mercury and oil. But although quantitative
results were out of the question, Mr. MuRRar succeeded in cstablishing the fact, which
we $hall find confirmed, that mercury is a better conductor of heat than oil.

$ 15. The question was in this unsatisfactory state when M. DzsPrETz published his
