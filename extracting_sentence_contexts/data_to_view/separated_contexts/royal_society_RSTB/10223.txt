Much remains to be learned
about this system, including whether the pattern-forming
mechanism is embodied in the same gene regulatory network
(e.g. the BSW versus two-galectin networks) in all tetrapods,
and how the developing limb’s gradients of Hox transcrip-
tion factors modulate the Turing-type system to generate
elements that are biologically customized rather than the uni-
form stripes dictated by purely generic reaction—diffusion
mechanisms [90,91]. What seems clear, however, is that the
range of skeletal patterns seen throughout sarcopterygian
evolution and in experimental and mutational variants in
present-day tetrapods is consistent with determination by a
Turing-type system under different parameter regimes [74]. This latter observation, in fact, pertains to each of the
examples discussed in this paper. Once a novel biogeneric
material has been constituted, either as a result of a mutation


in a predecessor material’s components that leads to a quali-
tative change in its physical properties [92], by horizontal
gene transfer bringing in a new ingredient [93], or as a
side-effect of gradual evolution for something else [94], it
will immediately entail a characteristic, and in some cases
unprecedented, set of morphogenetic possibilities. Highly
disparate phenotypic outcomes of a developmental system
containing this new material can be adjacent to one another
in the system’s dynamical space [95], implying that one
form can change into another with no intermediates.
