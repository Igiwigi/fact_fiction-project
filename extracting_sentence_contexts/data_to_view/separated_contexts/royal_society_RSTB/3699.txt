In Nemertinea,
which is the highest phylum possessing the smaller chromatin thread-width, they
appear to be longer than those of Echinodermata, which in turn have longer
chromosomes than occur in Ccelenterata. The lowest Protozoa show spherical
granules, whereas normal chromosomes of various lengths are observed in others of
greater complexity. The volume of chromatin remains constant in all metaphases of
the species, with the exception of the secondary spermatocyte or oocyte mitosis, in
which it is halved ; the volume of individual chromosomes likewise remains constant,
except in the first maturation division, where members of pairs are observed to have
conjugated, There seems, however, a general tendency for the total volume to
inerease as we ascend the animal kingdom, and consideration of each sub-division
possessing a definite chromatin thread-width shows an increase in rod-lengths in the
higher organisms ; on the other hand, the lowest animals in each sub-division appear
to possess complexes composed of chromosomes whose rods are spherical, and of a
diameter equal to that of the thread-width common to the sub-division.

14, In consideration of the facts enumerated above, I have constructed the following
working hypothesis :—

The chromatin granules of the simplest Protozoa are a visible expression of
differentiation and aggregation of specialised particles concerned with the trans-
mission of hereditary characters, and such granules probably do not represent the
sole bearers of heredity in the cell. The granules become converted into rods by
purely linear growth, accompanying evolutionary development and greater complexity
of the organism; this rate of growth is not the same in all chromosomes, and rods of
various lengths are therefore evolved. A stage is later reached in phylogeny when
rods have attained a maximum length, the limit depending upon physical conditions,

possibly connected with spindle mechanism; when this occurs, chromatin units
conjugate in fours, and the resulting rods have a diameter equal to twice that
previously seen, These segment later into spherical chromosomes of the new
thread-width, and such chromosomes are prepared to enter a new course of linear
growth, accompanying further evolutionary development.
