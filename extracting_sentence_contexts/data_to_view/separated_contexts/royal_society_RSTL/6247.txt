For these tensions the absorption of radiant heat by the vapour of sulphuric ether is
ie more than twice the absorption of oletiant gas. We also observe, that in the case of the
former the successive absorptions approximate more quickly to a ratio of equality, In
5 fact the absorption produced by 4 inches of the vapour was sensibly the same as that
z produced by 5. But reflections similar to those which we have already applicd to oletiant gas are also
: applicable to ether. Supposing we make our unit-measure small enough, the number of
rays first destroyed will vanish in comparison with the total number, and for a time the
fact will probably manifest itself that the absorption is directly proportional to the
density.
