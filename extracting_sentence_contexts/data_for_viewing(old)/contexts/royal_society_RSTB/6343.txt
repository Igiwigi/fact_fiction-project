strand of cells proliferated from the base of the endostyle. In Doliolum the
peribranchial and pericardial connections persist, as do also the two pharyngeal
diverticula ; but there is no doubling of the peribranchial and pharyngeal tubes.

Summing up one can say that isolation of buds in the Thaliacea is effected by the
general method of transverse epidermal constriction, that the central vesicle of the
bud arises from a pharyngeal outgrowth equivalent to the epicardia and thus
resembles the larval budding of Distaplia, and that various other tissues have been
incorporated into the stolon. â€˜These additional tissues are those in closest proximity
to the stolon base, namely, the posterior ends of the peribranchial chambers and
the pericardium, in each case a proliferation of relatively indifferent cell types.

The facts so far presented throw light upon two major problems, the morphological
homology and the histology of budding within the Tunicata. In the first one is
dealing with a question peculiar to the Tunicates, in the second a part of the general
problem of the relation between differentiation, plasticity, and cell division.

Morphology of Budding

Many classifications of Tunicate budding have at various times been evolved,
from the simple grouping under stolonial and pallial budding to schemes that reflect
every morphological variant of the process. Much confusion has arisen, and in
some text-books very jumbled and incorrect accounts are to be found. Altogether
too great an emphasis has been placed upon the morphology of the tissues or organs
giving rise to the totipotent cells in the bud, and it is no more logical to make
