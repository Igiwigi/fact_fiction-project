In January the tide at Liverpool, which follows the moon's upper transit by
about eleyen hours, is less than the following tide, when the moon is near the sun,
and consequently when the moon is south of the equator. This agrees with the equi-
librium-tide depending upon the position of the moon at the time of transit. But it
is clear that the tide which reaches Liverpool does in fact come from the Southern
Ocean; and hence the equilibrium-tide for the time of the moon's upper transit at
Liverpool will be greater than the following one, when the moon is near the sun in
January. Hence the tide at Liverpool is not that which corresponds to the equili-
brium-tide at the time of transit, but to the equilibrium-tide about either twelve or
thirty-six hours earlier. The latter is probably the right conclusion, and agrees with
the inference already obtained from the effects of the solar forces, that the tide agrees
with an equilibrium-tide thirty-seven hours and a half previous to the moon's transit.
