The internal evidence, also, is very strongly in favour of Derror’s narrative
having been founded on fact. The first news to reach England was that in Barbados
the startling phenomenon of a rain of ashes had caused great alarm, and it had been
preceded by sounds like distant cannonading. Similar noises were heard all over the
Caribbean Sea from Antigua to Trinidad, The rain of dust had been heaviest near
St. Vincent and in Barbados. Around the Soufriére the inhabitants had for a month
previously been terrified by the frequency of the earthquakes. Then the mountain
burst with a tremendous noise, hot stones and sand rained down for hours, and there
was complete darkness. Those who were in ships off the island saw a flash of fire,
followed by loud crashing noises. The eruption was sudden in its outburst, and
lasted only for a day or two.

These are, in fact, the distinctive features of the eruptions of 1812 and 1902, as
observed by those at some distance from the voleano, and the whole account resembles
in many respects very closely some of the narratives which were published in the
spring of this year. If Drror was able so exactly to predict the circumstances
of future eruptions of the Soufriére, he must have had even more of the creative spirit
of imagination than he has hitherto been credited with.

Humpotpt made several references to this eruption, though it is not exactly
known from what sources he drew his information. He seems to have had no doubt
of its having occurred,*
