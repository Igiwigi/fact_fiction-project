chain ends at 6,. Any point of D,,

xcept d, (£4 — 0) therefore has index 2.
Lastly, if &) = &) — 0, & =, 6, is the point d, only, and the chain can reach 65; that
is one point d, of the line D,, in the plane Dye, has index 5. The nest of the corollary consists

of this plane, line and point, whose dimensions are determined by the three different
lengths ¢, ¢’, €” of column in the tableau.

The case when several e; are equal, so that the tableau has several equal rows, is
easily analysed. Thus if exactly ¢, of the longest rows are equal then a certain [¢, —1]
of D’ would have points of highest index e,; similarly for the lower rows. The nest of
spaces in fact characterizes the increasing intensities of contact between D and A.

RATIONAL NORMAL LOCI

15. The nest of spaces formed by polar chains originating in a region D,, common
to D and the scroll may be regarded as an osculating system of a certain rational normal
locus. contained by the scroll. For example, the point, line, plane, ..., [/] of such a
nest originating in a single point of contact d, of index e = +1 prove to be the point of
contact, tangent line, osculating plane, ..., osculating [|p] of a rational normal curve
of order e. This curve which lies on # is contained by that space [e] which is defined
