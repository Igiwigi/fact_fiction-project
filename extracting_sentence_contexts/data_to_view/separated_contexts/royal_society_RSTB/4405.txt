I am further indebted to him for the supply of many fractured specimens of wood. The research has been carried out, in the course of more definitely applied work for
the Air Ministry, in the Barker Cryptogamie Research Laboratory of the University
of Manchester. [ have to thank Prof. W. H. Lana, F.R.S., for encouraging me to
attempt to relate the facts of the mechanical properties of wood to fundamental
botanical questions bearing on the structure of cell-walls in plants. The mechanical properties of a wood may depend on the microscopic or ultra-
microscopic structure of the substance of the walls of the cells comprising it, on the
form of these cellular elements, and also on their gross anatomical arrangement. *
