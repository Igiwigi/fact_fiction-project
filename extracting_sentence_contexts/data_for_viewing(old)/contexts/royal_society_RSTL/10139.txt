deter me from hopefully submitting the question to experiment. I accordingly tested
the water vapour of the atmosphere in which I worked, and found its action on a firs
trial to be thirteen times that of the air in which it was diffused.

It is not uninstructive to compare this approach to the problem with that of a very
distinguighed man—the late Profesxor Magus, of Berlin.* Subsequent to me, he
snbjected the aqueous vapour of our atmosphere to an experimental test; but he
made the experiment under the assured conviction that his result would be negative,
* It could,” he says, © be foreseen with certainty that the 8mall amount of aqueous
vapour taken up by air ab ordinary temperatures could exert no influence on the
transmission.” I think it must be obvious that if Maaxus had gone through the
discipline to which I had been subjected, he would not have nsed this language.
His mistake however was a natural one. In fact during the earlier stages of the
inquiry my mind was exactly in the condition of his mind—T also thinking, until
practically instructed to the contrary, that the action of aqueous vapour at ordinary
temperatures must be immeasurably small. Tt is well known that Macxvus tested his
foregone conclusion, and found it verified ; while T, on the other hand, as above stated,
justified mine.

The various gases which had been examined in the experimental tube with regard
to their powers of absorption, were next tested as regards their powers of radiation.
Columns of the heated gases were allowed to ascend in free air, and to radiate
against the pile. In this simple way, the radiative power of © transparent elastic
fluids” was for the first time establighed. The order in which the gases ranged them-
8elves, in regard to radiation, was exactly the order of their absorptions, Here, as in
