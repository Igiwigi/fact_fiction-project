These implements—specimens A, B, and C—are accordingly to be regarded apart
from those obtained from the Sub-Crag bone-bed. They are from a later horizon,
which is nevertheless a very ancient one, older than any of our river-gravels. It is a
very remarkable fact that they are of the hitherto unknown “ rostro-carinate” form
characteristic of the Sub-Crag bed, though more highly finished than the latter and

occurring in the same locality. Last August, I showed this implement to Sir ArrHur Evans, F.R.S., who was
set thinking by it; and, after a few minutes’ search, produced from the collection
of his father (the late Sir Joun Evans, F.R.S.), of which he is now the possessor,
the remarkable implement represented in the text-figs. 4 and 5, and in Plate 14,
