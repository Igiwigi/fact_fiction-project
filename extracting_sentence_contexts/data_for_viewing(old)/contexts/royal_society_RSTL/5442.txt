have previously called the allotrious factor; being in fact foreign to the value of R,
as determined by means of the equation (4.), and arising only from the particalar
method employed to obtain it throngh the medium of the system (1.): it becomes a
matter of some interest and importance to determine the values of this allotrious
factor for different values of *.
