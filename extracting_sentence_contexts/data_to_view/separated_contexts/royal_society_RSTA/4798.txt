On the other hand, it is relatively easy to make a structure composed of interacting
droplets containing oscillatory medium. It is also easy to fix required period of oscillations by
selecting proper concentrations of reagents. These experimental facts encouraged us to introduce
anew concept of information coding based on frequency of local oscillations. :=
Numerical simulations confirmed by experiments predict that high-frequency oscillations : Ss
can expand through the medium composed of oscillatory droplets analogously to expansion 12
of excitations in an excitable medium [56]. The phenomenon is illustrated in figure 7 where nee)
the time evolutions for different sets of droplets generated in a microfluidic reactor are shown. :
It is known that frequency of oscillations depends on the droplet size [56,57]. It seems that a ne]
few different phenomena can be responsible for this effect.
