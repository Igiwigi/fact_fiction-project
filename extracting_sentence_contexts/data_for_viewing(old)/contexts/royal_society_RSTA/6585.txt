The only instance in the Table, where the velocity during May increases in going
eastwards, is between Sutna and Hazaribagh. The latter station is, however, the
higher by nearly 1000 feet, but, being situated on a broad plateau, not an isolated
peak, this would probably not make much difference. At Hazaribagh, however, we
are on the border of the region over which these hot westerly winds prevail, the excess
of observations in the direction of the westerly resultant being, in May, only 15 per
cent., and the increase of velocity at that station is probably the effect of the frequent
incursion of sea winds from the south-east. ;

A suggestion regarding the origin of these hot winds may be derived from their
excessive dryness, above referred to ; in fact, it was from this circumstance that I was
first led to think of the key to their explanation, which I believe will be found in the
following pages. This dryness is such that the relative humidity of the air over the
Bundelkhand plateau, south of the Ganges, frequently falls in the middle of the
afternoon to 5 per cent. or less. Indeed, the humidity deduced by the usual Tables,
(founded on Aucust’s formula with ReGnautt’s constants) is occasionally zero or
apparently negative.* On the Gangetic plain it never falls quite so low, but in all

* Tt must be recollected that the formula is founded on the convection theory of the psychrometer.
The quantity to be deducted from the tabular pressure of saturated vapour, at the temperature of the

wet bulb, in order to get the vapour-pressure actually present, is ae The true value of the
factor s/d, specific heat of air divided by relative density of vapour, is about ‘38, but, to suit the formula
