Stylophora. In spite of a certain attractiveness in the subdivision of the Madreporaria into two
main Orders, Euthecalia and Pseudothecalia, as above arranged, I do not feel that
it is fully justified in the present position of research. The very fact that the
Eupsammide at present include one or two forms which zoologists have shown to
have either no edge-zone, or a very rudimentary one, warns against premature
acceptance of these sub-divisions. The most probable explanation of this is a certain
retrogression in the edge-zone, and correlative increased active development of the
remote neighbourhood of the polypal wall. The point is however not clear.
