While Grecory does not
advance any explanation for the presence of the enamel niche, he suggests that it may
represent a secondary vacuity developed in the dental lamina. Finally, BoLk attempted to derive the diphyodont condition of the mammalian
dentition from the polyphyodonty of the reptiles by showing that the latter possessed
a “‘distichical”’ dentition and that in the mammals the “‘ exostichos”’ (whose members
always form first in the embryo) erupt first as the milk dentition, to be followed later
by the endostichical elements which become the permanent teeth. The “exostichos”’
and “‘endostichos”’ are differentiated by the fact that the members of the former row
develop as “ parietal’? enamel organs on the lateral side of the dental lamina, while the
latter are formed at the extremity of the dental lamina as “‘terminal”’ enamel organs. That the teeth of fish, amphibians and reptiles do alternate is well recognized, and
such alternation appears to be an inherent and ancient property of the epidermis. It is
present in the teeth and scales of modern sharks, it is seen in the teeth of the osteolepids,
and again in the earliest tetrapods, the labyrinthodonts.
