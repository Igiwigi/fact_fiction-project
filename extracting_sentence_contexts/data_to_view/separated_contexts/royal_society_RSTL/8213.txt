Hopxixs's views), by showing that if the physical difficulty of such viscosity &c. be admitted,
other mathematical difficulties must arise if we cling to the method of Mr. HoPkins as
capable at all of giving any answer to the question of thickness of the earth's erust,
which the writer believes it is not. That that thickness is not small, however, the writer
believes to be the fact upon considerations wholly different from those of Mr. Hoekixs ;
and that view receives support from the investigation of Sir WILLIAM "THOMSON as to |
the rigidity of the carth, at least with those who admit the sufficiency of the physical
data upon which his mathematical reasoning there is founded. The effect, however, of
this conjunction of the reasonings of the physical astronomer and of the geologist has
been to raise a new difficulty for both.
