5 Again, taking the case of strontium, we find that in the case of strontic iodide thirty-
two lines are observed in the spark, one alone in the flame, and that is the longest,
Snamely 4607-5, a line by far the longest in the spectrum of strontium.

E Strontic Bromide gives also thirty-two lines in the spark and but one in the flame, the
= same longest line 4607-5.

E Strontic Chloride gives thirty-two lines in the spark, but only this one, 4607*5, in the
© flame.

3 Strontic Fluoride gives fourteen lines in the spark, but in the flame does not even give
E the longest line. There is, in fact, no spectrum at all due either to the metal or the

.o

2 compound.

FH It is especially to be remarked that strontic oxide furnishes us with an intermediate
E condition of things between the chloride and fluoride.

& Tn this compound the band near D is the only representative of the spectrum of the
"= compound. "The longest metallic line, 4607-5, is also invisible. We are justified, there-
© fore, in as8uming that only a small quantity of the undissociated compound is present in
& the reaction.
