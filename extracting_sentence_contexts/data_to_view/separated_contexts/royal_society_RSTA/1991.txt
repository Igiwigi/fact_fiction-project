We have seen that 19989 belongs to this normal set with a mantissa = 80A, and
that 20581 satisfies the condition necessary for a D, line with this. The difference of
their mantissa (see below) is 2940. If they are of the D,,, D,, types, as is indicated
by the fact that the first belongs to a doublet and the second stands by itself, a triplet
satellite set should be expected whose first line D,, is separated from the D,, by about
three-fifths that of D,, from D,,. Its mantissa should therefore be about 183 = A, less. This would mean a line about 19623 forming the first line of a triplet.
