In other words, the numbers of above- and below-average individuals are
about the same for each sex. (b) A Student's t-test shows a significant sex
difference (p < 0.01). (c) The effect is medium-sized (d = 0.60) but
there is a high degree of overlap (A = 76%). For the methods and raw
data, see the electronic supplementary material, table 53.

guidelines for zolpidem remains by far the most-cited example
of the need for sex-specific medicine.

A statistically significant sex difference does not neces-
sarily indicate a meaningful separation between the sexes.
Figure 3 shows hypothetical data for a fictional drug I will
call ‘Dimorphinil’. In this fictive sample of 40 men and 40
women, the sex difference in clearance rate is both significant
(p <0.01) and of medium size (d= 0.60). The effect size
exceeds that for some real drugs, for example, cyclosporine
and nifedipine, for which clearance rate differs significantly
between the sexes [77,78]. The low p-value and medium
effect size for Dimorphinil suggest non-trivial, clinically rel-
evant sex difference [79]. Yet, the percentage of males and
females above and below the overall mean is about the
same—22 of the males and 18 of the females cleared Dimor-
phinil faster than the overall average and 18 of the males
and 22 of the females cleared it more slowly. If we were to rec-
ommend. different dosages of Dimorphinil for men and
