The number of these back and forth excursions grows with the domain
size. By L=20Ar (figure 5b), the branch develops a notable Maxwell point that appears to be
associated with the formation of a homoclinic connection between the PP state that bifurcates
from the UV fold (cyan curve) and itself. This sensitivity to the domain size is a consequence of
the fact that the solution is always in contact with the prescribed domain boundaries.

(b) Turing bifurcation and Turing branch folds

There are two other sources of LSs, the Turing bifurcation on UV* and the folds in the resulting
Turing branch (figure 3). The Turing bifurcation is present when dm > 2 and theory shows that
there are two LS branches that appear near a = ay when the Turing branch bifurcates subcritically,
just as in the Swift-Hohenberg equation [29]. On a large but finite domain the resulting Ls*
bifurcate from the Turing branch at small but finite amplitude and initially resemble an extended
wave packet.
