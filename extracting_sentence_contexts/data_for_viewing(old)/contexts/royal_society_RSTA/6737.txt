equation (16). The inability of (16) to explain the deviations may arise from variations in
w, w' and dw'/dT with composition. That such a change occurs in w in going from pure
benzene to pure diphenyl can be shown by considering AH), at X, = 1 and AH, at X, = 0.
Equations (10) and (11) give

AH, = 2(2—)iNw at X,=0,
AH = ZNw at Xx,

These relations can also be obtained by a simple consideration of the lattice model and do
not depend on the method of derivation of (10) and (11). Extrapolating the experimental
results to these limiting concentrations we obtain 230 and 213 cal. for AH, and AH, respec-
tively. Thus if we assume z = 4, Nw is 38 cal. in pure benzene and 53 cal. in pure diphenyl.
Although this appears to be a considerable increase in w, the change is in fact small when
