In the Campanularic, besides the bodies of obvious medusoid structure which have
been noticed by 80 many observers to, escape fromthe capsule and then swim freely
away, and those of less completely developed; though still obvious medusoid structure
which remain attached at the month of the capsule, others are commonly seen in the

* The medusoids of the marine Tubuloriade are, during the early.stages of their development, contained in
a delicate external sac which afterwards disappears. This is the homologue of the external inyestment of the

Stomach of the medusoid, to be discharged from the mouth into an external delicate

those of the marine Tubulariadce, as well as the, parts immediately, concerned iw the
sexual reproduction of the Sertulariade, must be regarded; as distinct zooids*, pre-
