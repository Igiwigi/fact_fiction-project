corresponding to 3.2 dots deg? (figure 3c). At these den-
sities, the ellipse became much rounder, with an aspect
ratio of 1.8 instead of 6. Indeed, the data of figure 3c are
not inconsistent with the hypothesis that numerosity is
derived from independent estimates of density and area.
Besides supporting the notion of separate numerosity and
texture mechanisms at different densities, the fact that the
ellipse is quite different under these conditions shows clearly
that the narrow ellipse for the modest density condition was
not the only possible outcome, reinforcing the notion that
specific numerosity mechanisms are at work. Interestingly,
there is also support for the existence of three mechanisms
in the older literature. Mandler & Shebo [61] reported three
regimes of reactions times: an initial range of constant reac-
tion times, one to three elements (subitizing), followed by a
sharp increase in reaction times with item number, up to
about seven items, followed by another plateau. The region
of transition for the second plateau does not correspond
exactly to what we observe, but the pattern of results is
