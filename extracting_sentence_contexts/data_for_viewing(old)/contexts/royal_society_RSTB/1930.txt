These latter were lesions involving the reticular formation of the pons and crus,
In both cases, however, corticipetal degenerations were induced. These were traced
through both limbs of the internal capsule, the external capsule, and the centrum
ovale to the cerebral cortex, both on the convexity and mesial aspect, including the
gyrus fornicatus. This corticipetal system is less extensive in the frontal than in
the other regions of the cerebrum. It would seem to harmonise with the thalamic
corticipetal fibres, which Fiecusic has recently described as the first, second, and
third “sensory” systems, ascending respectively to the Rolandic area, the falciform
lobe, the frontal region, and gyrus fornicatus, myelinating at different periods.

Many of the fibres of the tegmentum appear to pass through the optic thalamus
without ending in it, while others terminate in this ganglion. This is shown by the
fact that destruction of the lateral and ventral parts of the optic thalamus led to a

more extensive degeneration than that following destruction of the tegmentum alone,

the fibres degenerating towards the same cortical regions. But we have not been
able to distinguish, by the degenerative method, between those of sensation proper
and other afferent fibres which ascend to the cortex in this region.

Many fibres from the optic thalamus were found to cross by the corpus callosum
to the opposite cerebral hemisphere, thus supporting the view of Hammron that
