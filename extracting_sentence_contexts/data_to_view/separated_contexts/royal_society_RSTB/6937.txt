In the case of
very small testes these measurements were made by means of a micrometer scale and a
low-power microscope, but in the case of the larger testes the measurements were made
with callipers. On the assumption that the testis is an oblate spheroid, the volume was
then calculated according to the formula

V = 4nab?,

where V = the volume, a = half the length, 6 = half the breadth. This assumption certainly
introduced an error as did also the fact that the measurements were all made after fixation,
but it was considered that the calculated volumes were sufficiently accurate for the pur-
poses of comparison. The volumes of the two testes of each individual were calculated
separately and the results added together. The figures given later therefore refer to the
total testis volume per bird.
