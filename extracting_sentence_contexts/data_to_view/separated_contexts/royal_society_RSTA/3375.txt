The interval between the two apparent maxima in the ranges is, as at
Kew, longer than that between the two maxima in the sum of the differences, the
latter appearing at both stations in June and August. The monthly ranges and sums of the differences appear, on the whole, a trifle
smaller than at Kew. This is really attributable to the fact that the mean sun-spot
frequency for the Falmouth period 1891 to 1902 was slightly less than that for the
Kew period 1890 to 1900. During the common period 1892 to 1895, in the mean
diurnal inequality for the year, the Falmouth range was the greater by 0/-10, whilst
the Kew sum of the differences was the greater by 0Â°57. As these differences
represent only about 1 per cent.
