By means of this formula, the plate can be calibrated for all
wave-lengths, but for the present purpose, only the values e = 0°4301, 0°23376 for
H, and Hy are required. Since the lines have a definite width, the theory outlined above is not strictly
applicable in its entirety, but if the resolving power of the instrument is great in
comparison with the observed (apparent) widths of the lines, it is well known that
the maximum for any one wave-length is not altered except in magnitude, and that
the plate gives reproductions of the lines in the successive orders with only a change
in intensity—which is uniform along the narrow line—of each of the infinite number
of components into which it can be resolved theoretically. Without the use of the
plate, the wedge photograph should be parabolic for each line in the ordinary
discharge as proved in a former paper*—according to the ordinary theory of
broadening—and the combination of wedge and plate should, therefore, also give
parabolic traces on the photograph under the condition that the lines are sufficiently
narrow. ‘This condition appears to be fulfilled in the case of the Hydrogen lines,
and, in fact, it is proved later that the traces on the plate, when reduced to a normal
pattern, are very accurately parabolic. Reduction of the Fringes to a Normal Standard.—We have seen that in the case
of a line broadened according to the probability law of intensity the fringes obtained
from the wedge and plate should be a series of blackened patches with parabolic
contours. Owing to the small variation of D, the path difference produced by two
refractions in the plate, the parabolas are not uniform.
