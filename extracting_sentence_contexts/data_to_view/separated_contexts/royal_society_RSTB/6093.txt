Should the rate of angular acceleration to the specified side have
been insufficient to induce body-righting, the frog may, on sudden cessation of the
rotation, right itself by rolling over the opposite side. As a delabyrinthized and
even a bisoliutricular frog under similar circumstances remain wholly unresponsive,
it is plain that some labyrinthine mechanism, retained in the biconjoint frog and
destroyed in the other two, is responsible, and in a perfectly determinate and
consistent fashion, for the righting of the rotated biconjoint. That the mechanism in question is the pair of posterior canals is indicated by the
following facts. As McNatty and Tarr (1933) have shown, prominent actions of
a given posterior canal are. (a) to cause spinal torque, (6) strongly to ventriflex the
head on the opposite side, and (c) simultaneously to extend, or stiffen, the hind-limb
on its own side of the body.
