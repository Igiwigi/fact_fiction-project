(6) The respiratory mechanism appears to be that which is chiefly affected by
Enhydrina venom. If large lethal doses are employed, such as Rocrrs appears to
have confined himself to, respiration falls rapidly, and a considerable rise of blood
pressure, asphyxial in origin, may precede death. The heart beat also quickly slows,
and blood pressure falls with corresponding rapidity.

Obviously, these are simply the phenomena of rapid asphyxiation. If, however,
smaller doses of venom are employed, no marked rise in blood pressure occurs. The
ordinary level is maintained till near the occurrence of death ; the beat then slows
and the blood pressure falls. Here we have an expression of gradual cardiac failure,
brought about by slowly progressive asphyxiation. The absence in slow Enhydrina
poisoning of the large asphyxial rises of pressure, which are so characteristic of the
final stages of Cobra poisoning, is readily explained by the fact that Enhydrina
venom has no direct constrictive action on the walls of the arterioles, such as Cobra
venom possesses.

(7) As to the part of the respiratory mechanism that is affected by Sea-snake
venom, the rapidity with which respiration is modified, both when venom is injected
into a vein and also when it is applied directly to the medulla oblongata, leaves no
room to doubt that the respiratory centre is directly acted on by the venom. On
the other hand, we have shown that some degree of motor nerve-end paresis is
constantly present in animals dying from the effects of subcutaneous injections of this
venom. We have also emphasised the fact that in our experiments carried out by
dropping venom on the exposed medulla oblongata, we have failed to kill animals
through the respiratory centre with the motor nerve-ends still undamaged. In this
