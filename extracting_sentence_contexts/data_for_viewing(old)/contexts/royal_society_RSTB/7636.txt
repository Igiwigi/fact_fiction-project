(The relation between f and U for these chemical data, and the values p,, can be seen in
figure 1, the values being so related as to make the curves apply to this example as well as
that in§ 8.) The value s = 3-333 leads one to expect a three-lobed pattern as the commonest,
and this is confirmed by the values #,. The four-lobed pattern is evidently the closest com-
petitor. The closeness of the competition may be judged from the difference p3—p, = 0-0084,

which suggests that the three-lobed component takes about 1208.u. or about 33h to gain
an advantage of a neper (i.e. about 2-7:1) over the four-lobed one. However, the fact that
y is different from 0 and is changing invalidates this calculation to some extent.

The figures in table 1 were mainly obtained with the aid of the Manchester University

Computer.

‘Although the above example is quite adequate to illustrate the mathematical principles
involved it may be thought that the chemical reaction system is somewhat artificial. The
following example is perhaps less so. The same ‘special units’ are used. The reactions

assumed are
A>X at the rate 10-3A, A = 10%,
