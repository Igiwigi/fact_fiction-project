plied to the monthly means.

From April 6, 1826, to the end of that year, the temperature has been taken from
the external thermometer, instead of the thermometer which dips into the cistern of
mercury, Consequently all the reduced values of the readings are too great. By the
external thermometer, I mean the thermometer which is placed outside of the building,
and consequently gives the temperature of the open air.

In the year 1827 this error appears to have been discovered and discontinued ; but
another of a different nature was at the same time introduced. For, from that epoch
to the end of the year 1836, all the corrections are made under the assumption that
the height of the mercury in the barometer was exactly 30 inches: when it is well
known that the correction will vary according to the variation in the height. In fact
there does not appear, at any time, to have been any regular and uniform system of
reduction adopted.

Now this state of confusion and uncertainty ought not to exist in a meteorological
journal emanating from this Society, more especially as the true values are as easily
attainable as the approximate ones. And although, in a general point of view, the
minute differences caused by such errors may be unimportant, yet as appeals are fre-
quently made to the barometer of this Society, as a standard, by persons engaged in
important researches, the most scrupulous accuracy ought to be adopted and pursued,
and the fullest explanation placed on record. And notwithstanding the details which
