§§ If the bodies De Seynes observed in Mycoderma, or other yeast, were spores, the credit of discovery
belongs to him (‘ Comptes Rendus,’ 1868, vol. 67.)

refractive bodies, probably oily in nature, floating loosely in the vacuole (see figs. 4 and 5,
Plate 12) ; while the cell, as a whole, is less translucent than an active Saccharomyces
cell. The fact of Mycoderma usually appearing at or near the end of a fermentation,
depends partly on the absence of oxygen during the activity of the yeasts in the
liquid, and partly on the domination of the principal form at the time. It was always
easy to suppress the Mycoderma in my cultures by putting the tubes, flasks, &c.,
into an atmosphere of hydrogen or carbon-dioxide. I suppose this is because the
Mycoderma is aérobian, though, as already stated, it can be grown (in pure cultures)
under circumstances where very little free oxygen must exist.

Cryptococcus glutinis (Frrs.*)?. Plate 12, figs, 7-10.

This is a pink or rosy yeast-like organism, and one of the most beautiful and
interesting of all those I have examined. Though fairly well characterised by the
