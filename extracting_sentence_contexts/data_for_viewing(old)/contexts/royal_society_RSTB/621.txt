observed may be, is not quite clear; but it does not appear to be an essential feature
of a lesion capable of inducing total anesthesia of the opposite side. It is probable,
from the results obtained by other physiologists, that the sensory paths are not so
entirely crossed in many of the lower animals as they appear to be in the Monkey and
Man, and that the paths of voluntary motor impulse are not exelusively direct, or
confined to the same side of the spinal cord.‚Äù

This is so very pertinent to the subject of this paper that I have quoted in full the
remarks of Professor Ferrier. It should be noticed that the photograph given by
Professor FERRIER shows an incomplete hemisection, for the whole of the posterior
median column on the left side is intact, likewise that portion of the anterior column
situated within the anterior horn; in fact, the destruction does not seem so extensive
as Case I. here recorded. The mode of preparing the section is not likely to yield
such satisfactory results as embedding in celloidin and cutting a large series of sec-
tions, as I have invariably done, nor does FERRIER state what degenerations occurred
above the lesion.

I made a preliminary communication to the Physiological Society, in March, 1890,
and showed some animals upon which I had made hemisection of the spinal cord.

Later on, in May, 1890, I read a communication to the Neurological Society, and
exhibited the sections. Professor Ferrier subsequently referred to some experiments
that he had made on unilateral section of the lateral columns in the Monkey, and he
found that sensation was retained on both sides, and from four other experiments he
