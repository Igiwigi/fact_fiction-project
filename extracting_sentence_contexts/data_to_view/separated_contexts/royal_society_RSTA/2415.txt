Figure 4. (a) Photograph of a polythiophene/CNT film on PET substrate (scale bar 10 mm). (b) Microscope image of a P3HT
sample vapour doped with F4TCNQ, in which dopant crystals are clearly visible on the surface of the film (scale bar 100 jum).

An additional difficulty arises from the fact that polymers and CNTs are intrinsically
anisotropic structures, which likely results in anisotropic thermoelectric properties [31-33]. The
Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivities are typically measured in thin films in the
direction parallel to the surface of the film. Standard techniques to measure thermal conductivity,
such as 3-omega, give out-of-plane values, and thus ZT values cannot be consistently given.
