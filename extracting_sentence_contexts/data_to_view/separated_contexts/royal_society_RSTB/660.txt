depression of epidermic activity from fatigue, or “shock” of
removal, causing a temporary diminution in the E.M.F. of the normal ingoing current. Two contacts upon the outer surface will often give evidence of difference of
potential, but I have never read more than ‘0012D, about one-fifth of the average
E.M.F. between inner and outer surface. This difference between two points on the
outer surface is to be attributed to an unequal distribution of secreting elements

“ Mechanical stimulation in the region of one of the externally placed electrodes

2 causes an increase of the negativity of that electrode (see p. 359), a fact much against

2 the mucin-metamorphosis theory of origin of E.M.F.

& The fact of proximity of an electrode to a gland mass favouring its negativity is

Sdemonstrable on the outer surface of the skin of the Toad, where with two thread

electrodes it is found that there is greater difference of potential when one is on a

e gland wart” and the other between two, than when both are over glands. Here,

sphowever, mechanical stimulation leads to diminution of negativity. = ‘Two points on the inner surface of the skin of the Eel show no appreciable difference

Tam of opinion, therefore, that it is probable that the source of the E.M.F. of the
