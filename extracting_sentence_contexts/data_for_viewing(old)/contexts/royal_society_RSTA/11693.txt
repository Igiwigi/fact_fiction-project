by a reading of the temperature of the reservoir; this reading was made with a
mercury thermometer which was graduated to 0°1 C. and read to 0°-01 C., its
indications being afterwards compared with a standard, Each reading of the gauge
was also preceded by a reading of the barometer. The pressure difference H on the
oil gauge was measured immediately after the discharge of the gas from the reservoir,
tap T; being opened immediately after T, had been closed, so as to allow the bellows
to pump air into the bell before the latter fell right down. The pump was kept going
during the whole of the time that T, was closed, an arrangement being made whereby
under these circumstances the pump could blow air into the atmosphere. Care was
taken to insure that the bell was quite stationary when the pressure difference on the

* T afterwards found that T; was unnecessary. It was quite easy to regulate the gas from the start by
means of T, alone, and to keep the bell floating in approximately the same position throughout ; in fact, I
was very much surprised and pleased at the ease with which the flow of gas into the bell could be
regulated by means of this tap.

+ The precaution was taken of measuring this temperature.

oil gauge was measured, since this pressure difference varied slightly according as the
bell was rising or falling, owing to the viscosity of the oil. In some cases the mean of
the readings with the bell very slowly rising and very slowly falling was taken.
After H had been measured, the taps associated with the oil gauge were turned so as
