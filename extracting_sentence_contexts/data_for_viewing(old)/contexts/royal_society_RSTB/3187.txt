a coarse wrinkling of the nuclear membrane (figs. 68 and 69). Finally, the artificial
nature of the nuclear irregularity is strongly indicated by the variable behaviour of
the nucleus with varying fixation. Only in material fixed with sublimate is the
irregularity of the nucleus invariably well marked. With other reagents, eg.,
sublimate acetic, bichromate acetic, or Hermann’s fluid, the irregularity may be
much less marked or even entirely absent, and this is true even of material taken
from one and the same individual.

Although the nuclear irregularity is thus seen to be dependent on the action of
the fixing reagent, yet the striking temporal relation which this irregularity shows
to the condition of the cytoplasm, and thus to the egg’s growth, indicates that its
occurrence is also dependent, in part at least, on a physiological condition of the egg
peculiar to this period. The fact that the nuclear irregularity is always well marked
in material fixed in sublimate solution alone, while it is much less marked, or even
entirely absent, when the fixing reagent employed contains a free acid, would seem
at first sight to suggest that the nuclear irregularity may be due to the slow action
or penetration of the fixing reagent.* This suggestion, however, entirely fails to
explain the cause of the direct temporal relation between the nuclear irregularity
and the stage of the egg’s growth, as indicated by the condition of the cytoplasm.
For not only is the egg, at the stage marked by the greatest nuclear irregularity and
cytoplasmic staining capacity, invariably at the surface of the ovary, and therefore
in a position to be most quickly reached by the fixing reagent, but the younger eggs, in
which the nucleus is perfectly spherical, are usually in the interior of the ovary,
either floating freely, or tightly packed between the larger eggs. Moreover, eggs at
this early stage are occasionally found at the surface of the ovary, yet their nuclei
