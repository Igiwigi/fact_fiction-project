In the last expression the second factor is finite (§ 17), while the
first can be made as small as we please by taking « small enough, if , is supposed
continuous. The same holds for the integral from #—p to a. Thus if f(a) is of limited total fluctuation between a+, and is, in fact, the sum of
two functions fi, f2 which are monotone between those limits, and continuous at @,
