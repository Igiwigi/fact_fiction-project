The effect of damping is greatest upon the yaw, and it is not really justifiable to neglect
it except when the time of burning is short. For long times of burning where several oscilla-
tions in yaw occur there may be an appreciable decrease in amplitude—apart from that
due to the increasing velocity—between the initial and final oscillations, which is attributable
to damping.

From a small number of calculations carried out with and without damping, it is thought
that the effect of damping upon the angular deviation is not very appreciable, but this
conclusion cannot be stated firmly without further confirmation. The main justification
for the neglect of the effect of damping upon the angular deviation is the fact, mentioned
before, that it is in the early stages of flight while the magnitude of the damping terms is not
appreciable that the greater part of the angular deviation is built up.

Neglect of Magnus forces. The neglect of the quantities —f,, —f, and w means that the
effect of the Magnus force L, and Magnus couples M, and M, can be ignored.} Of these
the couple M, is probably the most appreciable. Measurements of the associated parametert
a have been made for certain shells by means ofjump-card trials, but no direct measurements
have been made for any rocket so far as the author is aware. However, it has been possible
to deduce the approximate order of magnitude of @ for certain rockets from their behaviour

t The Magnus force L, has already been neglected as a result of Assumption A 13.
¢ The parameter o is connected with Fowler’s coefficient y in the following way:
