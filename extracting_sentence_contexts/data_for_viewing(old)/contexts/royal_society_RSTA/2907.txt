principle; they may only act if competent and only in accordance with the rules and principles
that govern discretion under the rule of law. Since legal certainty requires that citizens can
foresee how discretion will be used, there is a space for ‘legal regulation’ which basically
clarifies the policies developed by the regulator on how it will use its competences. As
Dworkin argued:

[D]iscretion is not the absence of principles or rules; rather it is the space between them.

As I explained in other work,‘ without rules or standards the concept of discretion makes no
sense; the mere fact of being bound by a particular authority creates the need to judge whether a
norm applies, what decision it calls for and how it should be performed. The rule-bound nature of
discretion makes possible a discussion about the interpretation and employment of discretionary
competences; it allows a learning curve by requiring those who intervene to give reasons for their
actions if called to account. Those reasons are—in part—the norms that regulate their behaviour
as public officials, but in the end, those reasons also include the situated interpretation of those
norms. In that sense, discretion is not close to but the opposite of arbitrary rule.

From the perspective of the rule of law, regulation can be understood in the context of the
difference between law and administration. Administration concerns decisions and actions of
governmental bodies; administration is not law but it does fall under the rule of law (legality
principle). As administration implies more or less discretion, it requires ‘legal regulation’, which :
can be seen as a subset of law that enhances legal certainty with regard to administrative decision- :=
