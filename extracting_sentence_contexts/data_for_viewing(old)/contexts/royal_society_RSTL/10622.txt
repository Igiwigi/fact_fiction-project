Notes on Polarimetry in general.

The problem of the polarimeter is how best to render evident the rotation through
a small angle 0 of the plane of polarisation of light of brightness k. The effect of the
rotation is to introduce light of amplitude }* 8in 6, or h*6, polarised in the perpen-
dicular plane, and it is this which must be made to produce a recognisable change.
By the use of a N1cor, or double-image prism, adjusted to the original plane, the light
of brightness k0? may be isolated, but, as will be proved presently, this is not the
best method of rendering its existence evident.

From the preceding mode of statement it is clear that the accuracy obtainable in
determining the plane of polarization increases indefinitely with the brightness of the
light, and is in fact proportional to the 89uare r00t of that brightness.F Again we 8ee
that little is to be expected from snch devices as that of F1zEAU, in which the rotation
is magnified by causing the light to pass obliquely through a pile of glass plates. The
brightness of the light polarised in the perpendicular plane (0?) can only be diminished
by such treatment, and the increase of rotation, being due merely to weakening of the
firs} component, is of no value.

The arrangements to be adopted depend for their justification upon the physio-
logical law of the perception of differences of brightness. If dE denote the difference
of' gensations, corresponding to two degrees of brightness, H and H+dH, we have \

in which Hy, is a certain constant brightness, supposed to depend chiefly upon the
