<a The bearing on astro-physical problems is at once apparent, and the high effective
8 conductivity of compressed gases must be taken into account when treating questions
Srelative to the mean temperature of the sun, its rate of cooling, or more generally,
3 any problem dealing with the physical state of gaseous astral bodies.
= Although extrapolations are always very uncertain, in the present case it seems
S justifiable to conclude that under the very great pressures with which astronomical
= physics has to deal, all gases or vapours would transmit heat at a higher rate than
= the best conducting solids known.
& From a practical point of view, the results obtained explain the very rapid cooling
& of the products of an explosion, a fact which has not only been noticed during the
3 course of experiments on ballistics, but has long been well known to all engineers
5 engaged in the construction of gas engines.
z The relatively small cooling surface required, in the case of gases under high
Q pressures, is a fact that had been previously noticed, and is already to some extent
taken account of in the design of the modern compressors.

The laws of thermo-dynamics show that the efficiency of all heat engines is
dependent on their temperature range and pressure : in compliance with these laws
the pressures used are daily becoming greater. It is therefore hoped that the present
investigation may be of some use to those engaged in practical engineering.
