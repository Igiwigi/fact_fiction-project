that the intensity of any spectrum is proportional to 1/sin’#, where @ is the glancing
angle, no matter whether the spectra belong to one or to several spacings of the planes. This involves both the facts just stated. We chose such a form of the density curve for the single atom that we could
account for the first fact. The important point is that without further hypothesis
we explain the second. -The formula we have obtained shows that when a*c* is small
compared to n*x* the intensity varies inversely as n?
