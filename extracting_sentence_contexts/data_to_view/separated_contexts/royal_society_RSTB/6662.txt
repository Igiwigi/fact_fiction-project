Mo.uusca OF THE Gaza Beps, LAKE RUDOLF

The recent molluscan fauna of Lake Rudolf is essentially of nilotic type, and there
can be no doubt that in time past the lake was connected with the Nile system. From
the geological evidence of the lake beaches and their associated human cultures it is
known that the present fauna has occupied the lake basin since early Middle Pleisto-
cene times, but that prior to its appearance there was an earlier molluscan fauna more

nearly related to species known only from the Central African Province. In fact I
believe that they represent a northern extension of the extinct Kaiso fauna of Uganda. Elsewhere (Fuchs 1936) I have suggested that the molluscan fauna of the Kaiso
beds may be ancestrally related to the peculiar modern fauna of Lake Tanganyika.
