W(x) =c

Aw=AWx*p=p+N,

and thus Ay >N in RN and Ay =N outside the support of p. In conclusion, the potential y : S
associated with the local minimizer satisfies a classical obstacle problem in RN with operator “
L=A, g=N, and f =2E[p] due to (4.7). Let us also remark that the obstacle problem (3.6) : =
associated with the scaled version of the fractional diffusion equation (3.4) can also be recast : 3
in the form (4.9). We will do this next but in more generality. :3

The basic idea for the Laplacian can be generalized and used to get properties on the potentials : =
associated with local minimizers of a larger family of interaction potentials W without resorting DR
to the local minimizers themselves. Let us review quickly the main strategy in [78]. The key fact : re
is that if the repulsive strength at zero of the potential is given by |x|°/b, b=2s —Nwith0<s<1, : s
then one can show that the potential yy = W « w associated with any d-local minimizer ju is a : 3
continuous function [78]. This allows us to deduce that for any point xp € supp(2) : SI

W(x) = wW(xo) forall x € Be(xo) (4.10)

holds. Here, ¢ is the size of the ball in dz distance where ju is a local minimizer. Moreover, for the
points in the support, we also get

W(x) =W(x0) in Be(xo) N supp(). (4.11)

Since lal? /b in this range is the fundamental solution, up to constants, of the fractional diffusion
