On the day that the shock occurred, and from the Kew
records alone, it was possible not only to locate the epicentre but also to obtain an
estimate of the focal depth. The information so derived was published in the Kew
Seismological Bulletin for February, 1931, and also in ‘ Nature.’} Reports subse-
quently obtained from other stations confirmed the fact that the shock was very deep
seated, so this disturbance has been selected for the detailed study and records from
a large number of stations have been examined. * * Proc.
