of the few examples of multidimensional linear parabolic equations for which a resolvent kernel
is explicitly known. In spite of these features, as we are going to show they have generated
challenging problems. An interesting discussion of the physical models and the main applications
ina historical perspective can be found in [1].

We point out that we do not deal with degenerate Ornstein—-Uhlenbeck operators, that can
be hypoelliptic and in this case share many properties with the non-degenerate ones, and that
there are several further issues connected with Ornstein—Uhlenbeck operators and semigroups,
which we do not discuss, such as e.g. functional calculus, properties of maximal operators, Riesz
transforms, and other issues of harmonic analysis. Our presentation is limited to the topics closer
to the interests of the semigroup community.

Many of the estimates that we are going to show are dimension free, and in fact a rich extension
of the theory to infinite dimensional settings (separable Hilbert and even Banach spaces) is
available. We refer to the paper Ornstein—Uhlenbeck semigroups in infinite dimension in this
volume for a survey.

2. The integral formula for the semigroup

In this section we sketch the derivation of the explicit representation of the semigroup generated
by A in the form (1.1), which is due to Kolmogorov in a special case and to Hérmander
in the general case. Formula (2.4) below can be derived also using the Fourier transform as
sketched in [2].

Let us consider the following parabolic initial value problem
