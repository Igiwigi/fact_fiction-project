time, because the critical relationship is only exactly satisfied for a single instant.
In fact, the problem is one of far greater complexity than that of ordinary disturbed
rotation. The sysbem is disturbed periodically, but the periodic time of the disturb-
ance slowly increases, passing through a phase of equality to the free periodic time ;
the problem is to find the amplitude of the oscillations when they are at their maximum,
and to find the mean configuration of the system some time before and some time
after the maximum, when the oscillations are small. This problem does not seem to
be soluble, unless we take into account the slow variation of the argument in the
periodic disturbing term ; and when the argument varies, the disturbing term is not
strietly a simple time harmonic.

In the cage of the viscous spheroid, the question would be further complicated by
the fact that when the nutation becomes large, a new 8eries of bodily tides is 8et up
by the effects of inertia.

I have been unable to make a satisfactory examination of this problem, but as far as
T have gone it appeared to me probable that the mean obliquity of the axis of the
spheroid would not be affected by the paasage of the system through a phase of large
nutation ; and although I cannot pretend to say how large the nutation might be, yet
I consider it probable that the amplitude would not have time to increase to a very
wide extent.*

* T believe that T hall be able to show in an investigation, as yet incomplete, that when this oritical
phase is reached, the plane of the lunar orbit is nearly coincident with the equator of the earth. As
the amplitude of this nutation depends on the sine of the obliquity of the equator to the lunar orbit, ib
