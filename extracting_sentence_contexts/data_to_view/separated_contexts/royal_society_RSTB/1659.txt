This same appearance is seen in one of Mr, Leon Witrtams’ photographs (fig. 83
of his paper), though he appears to interpret it differently. It will be noticed that in these oblique sections the partitions of the honeycomb
are well stained, as they usually are; but as we progress further into the more
formed enamel the corresponding areas become light, and it is the contained fibre
alone that is stained. In fact, the septa have almost disappeared under the action

of the decalcifying acid ; and, still further, in yet more developed enamel, they quite
disappear, leaving the fibres free. VOL. OLXXXIX.-—B, Q
