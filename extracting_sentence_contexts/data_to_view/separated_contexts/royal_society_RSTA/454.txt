This is reproduced in figure 19. As RAPID observations are not currently assimilated by the FOAM system (although studies
have considered this [69]), they can be used for independent evaluation of the initialized model
state—analogous to the use of surface drifters to assess the initialization of the ocean mesoscale,
as discussed in §2. More surprising is the fact that when only atmospheric boundary conditions are prescribed (i.e.
no ocean data are assimilated), the FOAM system still captures the majority of the 30% reduction
in the 2009-2010 event (blue lines in figure 19). This result does not preclude an important role
for the ocean in constraining the evolution of the atmosphere during this time. However, it does
indicate that constraining surface momentum and buoyancy fluxes is sufficient to explain the
seasonal and interannual variability of the AMOC at 26° N and indicates a limited role for initial-
condition-dependent mesoscale activity in driving the observed event during 2009-2010 [65,70].
