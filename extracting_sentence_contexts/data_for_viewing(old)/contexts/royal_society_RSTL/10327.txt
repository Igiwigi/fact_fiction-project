glycerine jelly. I find that when dyes are dissolved in s0lutions containing a higher percentage of
alcohol than that named above, most dyes will lose their selective power for particular structures, and
will begin to stain all tissnes alike. These results are confirmed as regards animal tissues by Dr. MayER,
of the Naples Zoological Station, See Mt. Zool. Stat., Neapel ii. (1880), pp. 1-27.

PROTOPLASM THROUGH THE WALLS OF VEGETABLE CELLS. 825

mounted in Chlor. Zine Tod. The cell-wall is coloured yellow ; the protoplasm and the
protoplasmic threads a dark brown. The s8uccess of the reaction depends upon the
fact that when cellulose has experienced a loss of water, and has become dry as in the
case of ripe endosperms and other dry tissues, the Chlor. Zinc Tod. will not at first
give the usual blue coloration. It is only after ome considerable time that the section
will begin to turn blue, or if the cell-wall be very thick or very dry, the blue colour
may not be produced at, all, but only a yellow brown, which is frequently increased in
depth by the precipitation of iodine attending such lengthy action. Sections of a
germinating 8eed of Phytelephas furnish an excellent proof that the assumption of the
blue colour on treatment with Chlor. Zine Tod. depends upon hydration, for whereas
the normal cells will give a yellow colour, those which are being encroached upon by
the absorbent foot of the growing embryo, and are being broken down and at the 8ame
time thoroughly wetted, will give in a peculiarly characteristic manner the customary
blue cellulose reaction.
