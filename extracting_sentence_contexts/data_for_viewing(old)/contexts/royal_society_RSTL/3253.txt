apprehend, will assist to explain why observyers have hitherto snpposed the embryo
to arise in the substance of a membrane. It is not a previously existing membrane
which originates the germ, but it is the previously existing germ which, by means of a
hollow process (bb2'), originates a structure having the appearance of a membrane+.

The Chorion.

221. When in describing the thick transparent membrane of the ovarian ovum in
the © First Series” of these Researches (/. c. par. 52.), I stated my opinion, in unison
with that of Cosrs and R. Wacxgs, © that this membrane is really the chorion of ova
met with in the uterus,” I had not discoyered the disappearance of one membrane and
the coming into view of another membrane in the Fallopian tube. Such, however, is
the fact, as made known in an earlier part of the present paper (pars. 174. 172.) ; but
it is one which did not fall under my notice until near the conclusion of these re-
searches, notwithstanding all the pains that had been taken to procure a consecutive
series of stages. It affords evidence that I was formerly mistaken in considering the
thick transparent membrane of the ovarian oyum to be identical with the outer mem-
brane of the oyum of the uterus, and © the membrana vitelli [e] to be still visible, and
to have considerable thickness in minute ova met with in the uterus.” It is not that
thick transparent membrane itself (f) which is identical with the outer membrane, or
chorion of the oyum of the uterus, but the thin lamina (Plate VI. fig. 104. « and Þ. cho.)
which was seen to come into view on crnshing an ovyum in a certain state in the Fal-
lopian tube. (The membrane (e) of the minute yelk-ball, as already mentioned (par.
174.), disappears by liquefaction during the passage of the ovum through the Fallo-
pian tube.) Those who are practically acquainted with the various difficulties to be
