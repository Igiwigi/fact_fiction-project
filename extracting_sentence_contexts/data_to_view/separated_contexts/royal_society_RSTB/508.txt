With the larger quantity of acid solution to a given weight of the surface soil,
much more nitrogen was taken up than under parallel conditions with the subsoil. But, in the first extraction there was little more, and in the second even less, than
with twice the quantity of the surface soil to a given quantity of the acid solution. In fact, there was, taking the two extractions together, even less nitrogen taken up
with the larger than with the smaller proportion of acid solution to a given weight of
soil; but with the larger proportion there was much more mineral matter taken up,
whereby the acid would be to a greater degree neutralised. There is, both after
1 hour and after 24 hours, much less nitrogen taken up in the second than in the first

extraction ; again showing that a certain proportion of the nitrogen of the soil is
more easily attacked than the remainder.
