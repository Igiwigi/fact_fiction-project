made the period of the oscillations so small that the drawing out on the film was
insufficient to separate the individual oscillations from each other. Thus their curved
lines represent a composite structure, consisting of all the streamers due to the
successive oscillations superposed on each other. It follows from their results that
the light of the streamers in the spark is entirely produced by the glowing of the
metallic vapour of the electrodes, and that, while the luminosity of the air is practically
instantaneous in its occurrence, that due to the metal vapour occurs in the centre of
the spark gap an appreciable time later than near the poles.

The actual process which goes on in the spark and gives rise to this delay in the
arrival of the metallic vapour at the centre of the gap is not yet thoroughly
understood. Scnuster and Hemsatecu make the natural supposition that it is due
to the fact that the metal of the electrode is vaporised and rendered incandescent by
the heat of the spark, and that the vapour takes an appreciable time to diffuse from
