above reason I have not proceeded to consider the changes in variability connoted by
(ii.) and (xxii.). As I have made no attempt to form a correlation table for mares’
and dams in which the dam would have only one daughter to her record, I cannot
make any plausible guess at the real magnitude of the cubic summation term in

(xxii.). Apart, however, from the numerical application of these variation formule
to a somewhat doubtful case, we see in these formule the theoretical basis for the
observed fact that the fecundity of mothers is far less variable than that of daughters,
It is really only an apparent divergence, due to the fact that the mothers have been
weighted with their fertility ; this, while it increases the apparent mean of their
fecundity, reduces its apparent variability.

(17.) On the Inheritance of Fecundity in the Brood-mare through the Male Line.

For the thoroughbred horse this problem is fairly easily answered by investigating
whether mares related to the same stallion have any correlation between their
fecundities. The two cases I have selected are ; (i.) “ Sisters,” daughters of the same —
sire, but in general not of the same mare ; and then (ii.) ‘ Nieces” and “ Aunts,” or
daughters of a sire and the daughters of his sire. As we have only 760 sires and
nearly 5000 mares, the daughters or aunts fall into rather large arrays, and we are
compelled to use the methods discussed in Proposition IV., A and B. Even so the
