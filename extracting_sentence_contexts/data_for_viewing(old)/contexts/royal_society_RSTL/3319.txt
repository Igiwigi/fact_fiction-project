within the fibres].***The younger the embryo is, the coarser are the elementary parts
[of musecle].***We have above remarked that from the period at which the muscular
fibre becomes uniform and transparent, globules accumulate in large number. Sub-
sequently they diminish, and with the jelly-like mass—which holds them together—
enter into the formation of the mucous tissue. This however unites—not the fibrillz
but—the fibres+.”

29. More recently, and with reference to the doctrine of © cells,” the same physio-
logist, has communicated his views in the following words : ©* As s0on as these
[muscular fibres] appear in the fibrous form, there are seen in them round, very pale
nuclei, which lie near together. From this it may be inferred, that here the cells
arrange themselves likewise longitudinally, but coalesce immediately with one another
without being drawn out into fibrillee. This conjecture is confirmed by the fact that
such an embryonic muscular fibre presents itself perfectly pectinate, as a conferva-
fibril with a nucleus in each cell. This pectinate object, however, I haye not hitherto
s0 observed, as to have convinced myself of its complete natural conformity. There

usually occur two circumstances which either call it forth or make it more distinct :
1. There follow the regular indentations of the muscular fibres, s0 that between two
there always lies a regular nucleus. 2. On the transyerse lines, which call forth
the pectinate divisions, there lie very minute molecules with opake contours and a
