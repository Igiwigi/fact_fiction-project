This bias, : a
perhaps not intentionally, relegates non-periodic stacking to less stature, as is evident in the use : &

of the term ‘fault’. It may be rather that disorder is the natural state of the specimen [57], in
which case employing a framework that incorporates this feature of matter upfront will prove
more satisfactory. In fact, it is not even clear that periodic order should be the ground state for
many kinds of materials, even for those with finite-range interactions and in the absence of fine-
tuning of energetic coupling parameters between layers [58], as is found in axial next-nearest
neighbour Ising (ANNNI) models [59]. Second, an analysis of the stacking structure based on
these categories may not be unambiguous, especially in the case of heavy faulting. Third, this
entire view is only tenable in the limit that a parent crystal exists, i.e. it only applies in the weak
faulting limit.
