I will begin with the account in the Saxon CyRoNICLE, which, as far as we can
collect, was compiled at Peterborough ; and, from their style and narrative, we can
scarcely doubt that these venerable annals were the result of notes taken down con-
temporaneously with the events which they describe.

1095. In this year Easter fell on the eighth day before the kalends of April; and
on the night of the feast of St. Ambrose (that is to say the 2nd before the nones of
April) there was seen nearly throughout all the land, and during all the night, mani-
fold stars falling from the heavens: not by one or by two at a time, but s0 thickly
that no man could reckon them.”

FLorgxce of Worcester describes the same appearance more shortly, by stating
that on the 2nd of the nones of April, in the night, © stars were xeen, as if falling from
heaven.”

The Chronicle of the ABBey of ANngou states, that © on Wednesday, the 2nd of the
nones of April, the moon being twenty-five days old, stars were seen falling like a
shower of rain from heaven upon the earth ;” an expression of some importance when
compared with the remarkable fact which we shall find given by the next authority. This is S1GEBERT of Gemblours, who states, that © on the 2nd of the nones of April,
about daybreak, very many stars were seen to fall at once from the heavens to the
ground.” One very large star thus fell in France; and a bystander, having noted the

pot, * cast water upon it, which was raised in steam, with a great noise of boiling:”
a description leaving no doubt that in this case the star was an aerolite. The Chronicle of Verdun, by Hucn vs Fraviexy, states that © on Wednesday, the
day before the nones of April, from the middle of the night until dawning, stars were
Seen falling.”
