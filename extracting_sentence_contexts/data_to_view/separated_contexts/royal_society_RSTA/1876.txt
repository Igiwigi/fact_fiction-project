obtained first an approximate solution which he termed “ Scuster’s approximation,”
since it was based on the method used by ScuusTer in his paper* on “ Radiation Through
a Foggy Atmosphere ” (the use of the equations of linear flow of radiation) ; he obtained,
secondly, the correction to Scuuster’s approximation. The result is that for an
extensive atmosphere the law of darkening is approximately a cosine law, with a
coeflicient of darkening of rather less than 3 (ScHusTER’s approximation), independent
of the coefficient of scattering. The analysis is identical, in fact, with that required
for radiative equilibrium in an absorbing material, as far as the integrated radiation
is concerned. The application which Scuwarzscui. D made was to the relative intensities in a
Fraunhofer line, and in the neighbouring continuous spectrum, and to the variation
of the ratio of these from the centre to the limb.
