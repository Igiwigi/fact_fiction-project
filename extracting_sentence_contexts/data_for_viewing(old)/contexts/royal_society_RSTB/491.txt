Fhe intra-cranial tension is raised is much greater. But the actual amount of rise as
fore mentioned is dependent for its extreme development upon the pre-existent
-getivity of pressor influences. The blood pressure may have been so raised in this
Snanner that no further rise takes place on division of the vagi.
© After division of the vagi the blood pressure can be raised higher still by the employ-
‘Jnent of artificial respiration, and by increase of the intra-cranial tension. Phenomenally
High blood pressure we have thus produced, if at the stage just described attempts at
gatural respiration should occur during the artificial respirations. Nevertheless, the
Erasomotor tone is gradually paralysed (just the same as when the vagi are not
Blivided) with a consequent fall of blood pressure, since at this low level 30 to
0 mm. Hg, there is no effect produced when severe intra-cranial pressure is applied,
Bhe only result in fact being to still further lower vasomotor tone. And this vaso-
Anotor tone, once lost, is not recovered from.

that an excitatory and paralysing result respectively may be observed, although the
various phenomena are not so clear as in the case of the heart. The excitatory
effect appears to be evidenced by the inspiratory spasms we have often observed.
