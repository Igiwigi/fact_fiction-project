The specificity of the configurational definition of predication
as it was in S— NP VP seems to have been lost throughout
the development of the analysis of clause structure. Predica-
tion is still associated to a configuration, i.e. (9)b, but this
configuration cannot be differentiated from any other
phrase; as a consequence, a compositional derivation of pre-
dication also seems to be lost.°

Given this scenario, the same original question, namely
whether there is any compositional, qua configurational, algor-
ithm to derive the special relation of predication, still persists.

4, Factoring out irrelevant features in predication

What remained constant across the development of clause
structure analysis, from S— NP VP to [7pNP [T VP]], is the
assumption that the preverbal NP is the subject of predication
and the VP is the predicate. This ‘dogma’ which has persisted
across the different analyses is due to a single fact: that the noun
phrases occurring with the verb are its arguments. A radical
departure from this schema imposes itself when non-argumen-
tal noun phrases are considered, i.e. noun phrases which can
play the role of a predicate. The simplest and more frequent
case is copular sentences, that is sentences involving the verb
to be and its equivalents across languages.
