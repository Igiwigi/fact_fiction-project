XXIV. On the Presence of Fibrils of Soft Tismue in the Dentinal Tubes.
By Jon Tomes, F.R.S., Surgeon-Dentist to the Middlesex Hospital.

Received February 21,—Read March 13, 1856.

THE dental tissues, as parts of the human system, have received their full share of
Attention from anatomists. Papers have from time to time appeared upon this 8ub-
Ject, each observer confirming or correcting the views of his predecessor, or adding

ew facts to those already recorded, until this field of investigation seemed fairly
xhausted, at all events of new matter.

: Histologists, I think, now agree that dentine is made up of series of tubes, which
Wadiate from one or more cavities, situated within the interior of the tooth. In their
Say outwards the tubes branch freely, and connect themselves through their branches
:Svith eachother; thereby establishing a network of communications throughout the
Avhole substance of the dentine. The tubes on the one hand, after running their
Zourse, become lost in the anastomosing branches near the outer surface of what has
2m termed a dentinal system, on the other, terminate by open mouths on the inner
Surface of the system#®, or pulp-cavity. This cavity being occupied by an organ rich
Jn blood-vessels, has led to the opinion generally entertained, that the tubes are canals
Jor the conveyance of nutritive fluid.
