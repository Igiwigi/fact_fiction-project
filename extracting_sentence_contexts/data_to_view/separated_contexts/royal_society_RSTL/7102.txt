BRODIE ON THE CALCULUS OF CHEMICAL OPERATIONS.

are symbols not of quantities (which may, be replaced by numbers), but of operations
(which cannot be thus replaced), which are defined by their results; and the units of
ponderable matter are primarily conceived of in this calculus as made up from their
component weights by the snccessive performance upon the unit of space of the opera-
tions indicated by the symbols of those weights. It is through this order of conceptions that we are enabled to introduce into the
chemical calculus the zero-symbol 1, regarded as the symbol of the unit of space, the
subject of chemical operations, without which symbol, as will hereafter be still more
clearly evident, the construction of a chemical calculus would appear to be impoxsible,
and the absence of which symbol, perhaps more than any other defect, marks the radical
imperfection of the present notation. It is moreover from this point of view that it has been found possible to assign to the
composite symbol xy, as the symbol of a compound weight, an exact interpretation in
harmony with symbolic analogies, and it is as symbols of operation that chemical symbols
have been proved to possess the properties given in the equations

TyY=yT,
a(y+11)=2y +291,
ay=a+y,

which afford an adequate basis for a symbolic method, and enable us to apply to these
symbols those algebraic processes through which symbols become an instrument of
reasoning. ,

But further, symbols of this class afford the most real and the most obyious expres
sion of the facts with which the chemist deals. That such operations as are here indi-
cated are the primary and immediate object of his study, and therefore the most essen-
tial particular to be embodied in the symbol, has been already, to a certain extent,
recognized by more than one master of the science, adverse to the atomic mode of repre-
8entation. Thus GERHARDT, in the remarkable words which I have placed as a fitting
motto to this paper, thus defines the object of a chemical formula. © Les formules
chimiques, comme nous Favons dit, ne sont pas destin6es A representer Varrangement
des atomes, mais elles ont pour but de rendre 6videntes, de la maniere la plus simple et
la plus exacte, les relations qui rattachent les corps entre eux s0us le rapport des trans-
formations”*, Now if this be the object of a formula, how unreasonable is it to attempt
the expression of that formula by symbols which not only permit, but even compel us
to regard it from the atomic point of view.
