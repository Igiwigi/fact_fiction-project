tion—Spark—Brush— Difference of discharge at the positive and ne-
gative surfaces of conductors.

1318. I PROCEED now, according to my promise, to examine, by the great facts
of electrical science, that theory of induction which I have ventured to put forth
(1165. 1295, &c.). The principle of induction is 80 universal that it pervades all
electrical phenomena ; but the general case which I purpose at present to go into
consists of insulation traced into and terminating with discharge, with the accompa-
nying effects, This case includes the various modes of discharge, and also the con-
dition and characters of a current; the elements of magnetic action being amongst
the latter.
