Thus, within the framework of REF CON, multimodal
leaving part of the somatotopic representation ‘vacant’, a perceptual phenomena such as the McGurk illusion [80] can
reorganization of this representation will occur. If, for instance, easily be accounted for. The McGurk illusion (the fact that audi-

a hand is amputated, the contralateral somatosensory represen- tory perception of syllables is modified by simultaneously
tation will undergo a change in which the two representations watching a face pronouncing a different syllable) reflects the
(the face and arm, respectively) neighbouring the now ‘vacant’ fact that even when consciously perceived as a purely auditory
hand area will ‘grow’ and eventually completely cannibalize process, auditory perception of spoken language is in reality a
the area previously representing the now amputated hand multimodal process whenever relevant visual information is
(e.g. [73-75]). Thus, within the somatotopic representation, available. Some of the neural mechanisms associated with this
the area previously receiving input from the now absent hand multimodality are presently being analysed (e.g. [81]) and such
will become activated by input from body-parts previously an analysis may provide cues regarding the neural networks
unable to activate this part of the somatotopic map.
