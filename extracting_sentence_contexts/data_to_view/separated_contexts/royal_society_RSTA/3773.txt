A single value of V corresponding to a single value of A is evidently not sufficient
to determine whether any conductor fulfils the above definition of resistance and
E.M.F. To determine this the current must be varied over some range, 5A, and in
such a manner that the conditions of the conductor remain unchanged, and a series
of observations must be made within this range. The essential stipulation, that the test must not alter the body tested, is the main
difficulty in the experiments on the resistance and E.M.F.’s of the are. For it is well
known that, corresponding with each steady value of the current, the size and
configuration of the vapour column and craters are different in spite of the fact that
the length, the nature of the electrodes, and the other conditions may be kept
constant, so that the ares corresponding with any two different steady values of the
current, however nearly equal they may be, are really two distinct and different

phenomena. ‘Therefore all methods which depend on the steady change 8V in the
potential difference V produced by a given steady change 6A in the current A, that
is to say, which depend on an excursion on the steady curve between V and A,
however small it may be, simply measure the difference between the P.D.’s required
to maintain an are with a current A and a distinct and different are with a current
A+6A, which is evidently no measure of either the resistance of the are with
current A or with A + 6A. If the measuring current SA is only applied for a short time 6¢, it is necessary that
the energy supplied to or removed by it shall be so small as not to appreciably alter
the thermal conditions of the very small mass of gaseous and other material which is
taking part in the conduction of the current.
