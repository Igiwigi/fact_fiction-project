For interpreting the values of (s) it is important to note that

repeatability? Addressing these questions will require new
data and the development of new theory and methods. We
outlined some approaches that could be fruitful.

Community evolution under demographic noise alone, without
selection or ecological interactions, is equivalent to the neutral
