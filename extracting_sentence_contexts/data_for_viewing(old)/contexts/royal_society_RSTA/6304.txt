the principal stretches stands out from the majority of phenomenological hyperelastic models,
which are formulated in terms of the principal strain invariants. Clearly, the invariants can be
expressed as quadratic functions of the principal stretches (see e.g. [3]), whereas the squared
principal stretches are the roots of the characteristic polynomial in terms of the principal
invariants [4,5]. Accordingly, any invariant-based strain-energy density function can generally
be expressed in terms of the principal stretches and vice versa. However, the corresponding
reformulation generally leads to more complicated mathematical expressions, which can become
particularly cumbersome in the analysis of stress and stiffness. In fact, simplicity of mathematical
analysis was an explicit argument for the development of Ogdenâ€™s incompressible model [1]

directions in isotropic hyperelastic materials, the form (1.1) leads to particularly lean expressions
for the principal stresses, which facilitate comparison of the model response under ideal
