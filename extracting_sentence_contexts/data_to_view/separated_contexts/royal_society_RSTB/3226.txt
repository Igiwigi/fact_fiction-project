Petrified wood
found in connection with Tylodendron is of the Araucarian type. In all probability,
therefore, Schizodendron represents the pith-cast of a Paleozoic plant—possibly
Walchia, a genus which would seem to include species bearing a greater similarity
to Araucaria than to any other existing genus. ZrrLLERt, who holds the view that
Schizodendron stands for pith-casts of Walchia, mentions the fact that in many places
Walchia is the only Gymnosperm found in association with the pith-casts. Gomphostrobus.—This genus was instituted by Marion§ for certain fossils from the
Permian of Lodéve, possessing vegetative characters bearing a resemblance to those
of Walchia and distinguished by monospermic deciduous cone-seales with a bifureated
lamina. Srerzet|| states that he has found Gomphostrobus at Chemnitz in
association with Araucarioxylon wood, Figures of this plant of somewhat doubtful
affinity may be found in the works of Poronti, Zeriier, and others.
