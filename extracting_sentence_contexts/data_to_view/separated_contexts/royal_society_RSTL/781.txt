BiorT has endeavoured to account for the absence of
polarisation and double refraction in this class of crystals
by remarking—* that the phenomena of the attractive class
are explicable by a prolate ellipsoid and those of the re-
pulsive class, by an oblate ellipsoid; and that the sphere,
forming a passage from one of these limits to the other
constitutes a sort of neutral state, and corresponds to those
crystals which, crystallizing in the regular octohedron or
the cube, are destitute of the property of double refraction,” *

250 Dr. BxewsSTER on: the laws of polarisation, Sc. This remark, however, is by no means an explanation of
the fact. It is merely a different mode of expressing the
fact, that the cubical and octohedral crystals have no double
refraction; for the sphere is applicable to the optical action
of air and all other fluids, whether aeriform or liquid, which
have not the property of double refraction. The discovery of the remains of polarising axes in a great
number of crystals of this class, completely proves that,
like all other crystallized bodies, they actually possess the
doubly refracting and polarising structure, but that this
structure entirely vanishes in some specimens, by the equi-
librium of the forces in every point of the crystal, and
reappears in some specimens when that equilibrium is not
complete.
