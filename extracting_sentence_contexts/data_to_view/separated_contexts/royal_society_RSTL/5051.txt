It wilt appear to any"one who reads the whole of
his Zer, and is at all acquainted with the geography of
the» country, that Giraldus (who was a. native of
Pembrokeſhire) never was himſelf in theſe mountains

Upon theſe. occaſions, T have frequently inquired
Whether there | was any ſuch 'notioh vor tradition
amongſt the mountaineers; with regard to monocular
fiſh, and have found, that it is ſuppoſed there are
ſuch in-a-poolcalled Llyn'yCwn, which indeed T hive
never-ſeen; but, 'by-the beſt accounts 1 can procure,
it js. high up the Glyder mounrain; which forms the
oppoſite {ide of the vale of Lanberris to Wyddva,
or the higheſt part of Snowden,

I have, by means of aw interpreter, examined ſome
of theſe mountaineers very particularly with regard to
this point.” One of them told me that, thoughhe
had often heard- of theſe monocular fiſh, yet he had
ſeen two. or three taken by an angler in Llyn y Cwn,
which did not ſeem, to differ ffom common trout;
and indeed the fiſh of that: lake are ſeldom caught,
as.they are of very difficult accels, and have no extra-
ordinary character either for goodneſs or ſize.
