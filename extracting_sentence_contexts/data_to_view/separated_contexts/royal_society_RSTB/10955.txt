More-
over, 3-day-old chicks also succeeded in a task that implies the
discrimination between larger numbers, when overall area, over-
all perimeter, area and density were contemporarily controlled
[51]. This indicates that while feeding, chicks spontaneously
encoded numerical information. They in fact were not trained
by operant conditioning, nor were they required to respond by
pecking on the stimuli for food reinforcement. Data gathered in these experiments, and especially the suc-
cess in comparing a small (two) and a larger numbers (eight),
support and expand to the dominion of very young non-
humans animals, the hypothesis that AMS can distinguish
quantities along the numerical continuum. Evidence in this
direction was previously reported in adult humans performing
a non-symbolic numerical task [6], seven-month-old infants
[52] and other species [7,33,47].
