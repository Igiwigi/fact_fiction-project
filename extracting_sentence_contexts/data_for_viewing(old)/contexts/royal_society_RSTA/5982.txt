and the molecular Hamiltonian

This last Hamiltonian is different from the Hamiltonians using adiabatic states (equations (2.5)—
(2.6)) in the sense there are no non-adiabatic couplings tss involved. This is due to the fact
that MCA states do not depend on the nuclear coordinates and are therefore strictly diabatic.
Therefore, the non-integrable DBOC terms do not appear and all terms in the Hamiltonian
are now integrable. Even the non-adiabatic coupling vector t;s(X) does not appear in the
Hamiltonian, which makes the numerical integration more stable. However, projection of the
Schrédinger equation on the MCA basis gives an equation of motion for the coefficients C.,(f)
that involves an object similar to t<,'(X) [44,45]. Indeed, the time-derivative of the MCA electronic
states, also named time-derivative coupling [32], appears from this projection. Using the chain
rule, one obtains
