mutations, appears to offer a simple explanation of the origin of polymorphism
among Termites. It, furthermore, accounts for the persistence of castes, which are
in themselves mostly sterile, securing their representation in the germ-plasm of the
species in each succeeding generation. It will be observed, from the above Table,
that in the soldiers there is a predominance of S, and in the workers A is ascendant
over 8. It will also be seen that the gametic composition of both these castes varies.
In certain individuals both the factors A and 8 are represented, or, in other words,
they retain a proportion of the unmodified germ-plasm of the winged forms. This
feature in itself appears to offer a reasonable hypothesis explaining certain phenomena
which have never been adequately accounted for, viz., the occasional persistence
among the soldiers and workers of certain features which belong sensu stricto to the .
winged sexual forms. These are: (1) the occasional presence of wing vestiges in
both soldiers and workers ; (2) the fact that nymphs with well-developed wing
rudiments (and apparently differing in nowise from the nymphs of the winged forms)
have been observed to develop into soldiers. Hitherto, the occurrence of such
individuals has been accounted for on the belief that they are nymphs of the winged
forms which have become “converted” into soldiers through the agency of changed
nutrition. On the other hand, I maintain that it is owing to the mixed nature of
the germ-plasm of these individuals that the transitory parental characters appear
in their ontogeny, before those of the caste to which they belong ultimately assert
themselves.

In the primitive type, Archotermopsis, it has already been pointed out (p. 125) that
a study of the anatomy and histology of the generative organs points to the conelu-
sion that the soldiers in this genus are perfectly capable of reproduction. Very
