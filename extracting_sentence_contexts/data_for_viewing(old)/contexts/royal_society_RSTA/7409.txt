At first sight it might appear that the gain in efficiency resulting from the use of random
sampling with one point per block instead of two points per block, or the use of systematic
sampling instead of random sampling with one point per block, is equal to the gain in
precision with a given intensity of sampling. This, however, is not the case, because with
amore accurate type of sampling a lower intensity will be required to attain a given accuracy,
and consequently the block size or sampling interval will be increased. If, for example,
random sampling with one point per block is twice as precise, for a given intensity of sam-
pling, as random sampling with two points per block (R,,/R, = 2), halving the number of
sampling points with change from random sampling from two points per block to one point
per block would result in doubling the block size, in which case the variance per point would
be the same as that for the original sampling. The intensity of sampling required to give the
same accuracy with random sampling of one per block is in fact 1/,/2 that required for
random sampling with two points per block.

In general terms, if the ratio R,,/R, = ¢ remains constant over the relevant range, so that
