To separate, as suggested, the Malay Peninsula,
would give sub-area 8, India Orient., a boundary partly political, partly geographic ;
nor would doing this materially improve the naturalness of sub-area 8. The Malay
Peninsula goes well enough with Tenasserim and Lower Burma; but, if it were
excluded, we should still have included in sub-area 8, first, the Tibetan flora (from
North Sikkim to Baltisthan) which is Mongolian, or at all events widely different
from that of India at 0-1000 feet elevation ; secondly, the Sind Flora which is that of
Bosster’s ‘ Flora Orientalis,’ 7.e., my sub-area 2, Mediterranea. The fact is that it is
hopeless to get sub-areas the size of my 23 sub-areas “natural ;” smaller sub-sub-
areas may be devised that are far more natural. Greenland goes more naturally with Iceland than with North Canada, but the
difference is not very large (as it is in the case of the Tibetan flora included in
the sub-area of India Orient.). I put Greenland with America (in Nearctica)
because Wattace did so.
