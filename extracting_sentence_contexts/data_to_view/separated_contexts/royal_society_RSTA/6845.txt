An examination of table 6 shows that the double peak experienced during the early
hours of 1 February was due, in the main, to variations in the local wind, as indicated by
the N, E columns. In the final prediction this effect has been masked by the addition of
the Dunbar residual (Rp).

13. CONCLUSION

In the light of the facts and deductions made in this paper, it is desirable to consider
past and future methods of approach to research on storm surges in the North Sea, and in
particular to the problem of improving the prediction formula quoted. The conclusions
arrived at, with suitable modifications, will apply equally to the Irish Sea and English
Channel. The author is greatly indebted to Dr Doodson for his interest in this aspect of
the present paper, and for the history of previous research both by himself and his
associates.
