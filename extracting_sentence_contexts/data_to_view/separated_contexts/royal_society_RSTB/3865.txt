E. AGAR: EXPERIMENTS ON INHERITANCE IN PARTHENOGENESIS. 461

of individuals and their ancestors to about 0-4 to 0Â°5. That this is not a partial
inheritance of genetic constitution, but a partial obscuring (by environmental
modification) of identical genetic constitutions is indicated by the fact that the
correlation between individuals and their immediate parents is no higher than between
them and their more remote ancestors, while the opposite would be expected if the
genetic constitution were not inherited intact. The diminution in the intensity of resemblance between individuals and their more
and more remote ancestry, for certain complex somatic characters in sexual popula-
tions, receives a perfectly satisfactory explanation in the shuffling, at each successive
conjugation, of the factors on whose interaction the character depends. And since,
when this shuffling is absent, as in parthenogenesis, this diminishing of the degree
of resemblance to more remote ancestors does not take place, we are bound to accept
it as the most probable explanation.
