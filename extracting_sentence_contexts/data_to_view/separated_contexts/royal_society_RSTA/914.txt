Already one decade earlier, Prigogine, then : &

aged 29, had written with Jean-Marie Wiame, a microbiologist also working at the Université
Libre de Bruxelles, a brief note in French entitled ‘Biologie et thermodynamique des phénoménes
irréversibles’ [6], where they applied the non-equilibrium thermodynamic approach to the
evolution of biological systems. Building on the pioneering work of Turing published in 1952 [7], in the 1960s Prigogine
extended his analysis to self-organization in space [8,9]. To stress the fact that non-equilibrium
self-organization in open systems requires the dissipation of energy, Prigogine coined the
term ‘dissipative structures’, so as to distinguish them from equilibrium structures [3,10]. The
conditions for dissipative structures are readily encountered in living systems, which are (i)
open, (ii) governed by nonlinear evolution equations, and (iii) operate far from thermodynamic
equilibrium. A major source of nonlinearity is provided by a variety of feedback processes,
which evolved at the cellular and supracellular levels to optimize the operation and survival
capability of biological systems.
