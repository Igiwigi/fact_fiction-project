enhancements at around 4mHz. Instead, this is most likely due to these observations sampling
the quietest solar region in our sample. In fact, it was found that these two quiet datasets (i.e.
D6 and D9) had smaller surface mean magnetic fluxes, by 1 — 3 orders of magnitude (averaged
over their entire FOVs; also, similar flux ratios at chromospheric heights), compared to the other
eight observational fields of view (table 2). Furthermore, the Dé and D9 datasets have the largest
oscillatory power compared to the other image sequences. As can be seen in figure 11, this is
evidenced by datasets D6 and D9 showing prominent spectral power excesses in the range of
3-5 mHz, in addition to the largest frequency-integrated power (ranked number 2 and 3 of the
10 datasets), suggesting that these particular datasets have heightened wave energies across the
entire frequency spectrum. These findings are consistent with previous coronal studies [96], where
the largest velocity wave power was found to be correlated with low magnetic flux regions, and
in particular, at frequencies larger than 3 mHz.

There have only been a few studies focusing on the dominant frequencies of oscillations in the
