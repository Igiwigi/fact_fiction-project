When polynomials of degrees
exceeding ten are being root-squared it is not uncommon to lose two or three figures ‘ off
the front’ in each of the early transformations; by the time three or four transformations
have been completed several coefficients may have disappeared entirely and the work
must be repeated using more figures. In order to understand this phenomenon, consider the application of the root-squaring
transformation to the polynomial*

* For typographical reasons (n|s) is used to denote the binomial coefficient (") i


EVALUATION OF ZEROS OF HIGH-DEGREE POLYNOMIALS _ 395

If the coefficients of the transformed polynomial g(x) are denoted by 4,, then from equation
(2:3) we obtain
b, = a"-25 (n | s)2—2(n| s—1) (n|s+1)+2(n|s—2) (n|s+2)—...]. (3-12)

Now since the zeros of g(x) are all equal to —a?, the sum of the terms in the squared bracket
in equation (3-12) must equal (n|s). If—1>s>1, some individual terms are consider-
ably greater than (n|s), showing that if the process were performed numerically partial
cancellation would take place; in fact, since (n | s)?>(n|s—r) (n|s+r) ifr>0, the number
of leading figures which cancel is approximately equal to the number of digits in (n| 5)
itself. Further transformations produce the same effect. Returning to the general polynomial of the nth degree, there is no reason to suppose that
Ssystematic cancellation will occur when the zeros are widely separated, and the inference
Sis that it takes place only when some zeros are either equal or close together in the complex
plane.
