stage is characterised by its wide mouth-bay and its enormous heart. So also in Hapale
(as I have myself observed in the 6 mm. embryo) and in Chrysothrix, the extremely
voluminous heart remains for long an outstanding characteristic, and with this feature
is associated the relative smallness of the head in proportion to the trunk as in all
monkeys and in contrast with the human embryo. ‘The development of the head, he
states, proceeds relatively more rapidly in the Platyrrhine monkeys than in man,
perhaps because of its smaller size. Its fore-brain region, though smaller than that of
the human embryo of the corresponding stage, as in all monkeys, is of much the same
shape as in the latter, whilst its diencephalic and mesencephalic regions exhibit a much
greater difference, being shorter as well as narrower.

On Pl. 10, figs. 65-68, I have provided four figures of fairly comparable foetal stages
of Galago, Tarsius, Hapale and Homo to illustrate the fact that in spite of obvious
differences, they exhibit a very decided family resemblance to each other and are all
unmistakably members of the Order Primates.

A.—Pithecoid Stage—Placentation.

The general course of the development and the structure of the placenta in the
Platyrrhines and Catarrhines is now fairly well known, thanks to the labours of a large
number of investigators from the time of BrescuEr (1845) onwards, and including
amongst others, ‘TURNER ('77), SELENKA (’99, ’00, °03), STRAHL ('03), STRAHL and
Happs ('05), WisLocki (29), though we are still ignorant of the earliest stages in the
attachment of the Catarrhine blastocyst.
