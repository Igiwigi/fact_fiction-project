The velocity changes in STOCH_CPL are quite different. Most of the drift in the central
Arctic is increased or slightly redirected towards the north coasts of Canada, the Canadian Arctic
Archipelago and Greenland. Due to the fact that there is no accumulation in Arctic sea ice, the

but for the difference between STOCH_CPL and REF, years 1-201. Hatched areas indicate differences statistically significant at
the 5% level, using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test for the paired samples of STOCH_UNCPL-REF and a Wilcoxon—Mann—Whitney
rank-sum test for the independent samples of STOCH_CPL-REF [44]. Note the different contour intervals.

effective decrease in sea ice strength is not balanced.
