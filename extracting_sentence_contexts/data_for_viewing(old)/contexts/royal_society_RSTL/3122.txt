The astronomical refractions have also occupied the attention. of the astronomer of
Keenigsberg, who has contributed s0 largely to. the improvement of every part of
astronomical science. For the purpose-of representing the observations of BrapLey
with all the accuracy possible, BesseL investigated a table of refractions which ap-
peared in the Pundamenta Astronomice in 1818. He assumes a theoretical formula ;
but as every arbitrary quantity is determined by a careful comparison with real ob-
servations, what is supposititious may be considered merely as an instrument of invyes-
tigation, which is finally laid: aside, leaving the result to rest on the foundation of

fact. He returned to the snhject in his Tabule Regiomontance, published in 1830.
In this last work he retains only that part of the table of 1818 which extends to 85?
from the zenith, many corrections being applied from recent observations made with
improved instruments. In order to snpply what is wanting in the new table, Besszr
has added a supplemental one containing the refractions at every half degree for
altitudes less than 15%: which supplemental table is independent of theory, being
deduced from obseryations alone. These two tables form together a real table of
mean refractions, independent of all suppositions respecting the constitution of the
atmosphere; and no other similar table of nearly equal authority is to be found in
the astronomy of the present day. What BegssEL has accomplished on the subject of
the refractions is not the least important part of his labours for the advancement of
astronomical science : it is precious to the practical astronomer; and it is necessary
to the theoretical inquirer, for enabling him to confront his speculations with the
