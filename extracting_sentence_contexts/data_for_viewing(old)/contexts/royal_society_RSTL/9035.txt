No. 14 is a piece similar to No. 11. Its resistance at ordinary temperatures is about
-390 of a megohm.

No. 15 is a piece yery sjmilar to No. 14, but it has evidently undergone the annealing
process much better than No. 14, as its resistance at ordinary temperatures is about
-025 of a megohm.

No. 20 is a small piece of sclenium stick, about 2 centims. long, made up like No. 11.
It was annealed in hot sand, and its resistance at 14* C. is about 905 ohms.

No. 21 is a piece of the same wire, made of the same stick, and annealed with No. 20.
That it did not take the annealing 0 effectually is clear from the fact that its resistance
at 14* C. is about 120,000 ohms.

No. 22 was made up at the same time and in the same way as Nos. 20 & 21. The
annealing was more 8uccessful than in the case of No. 21, its resistance at 14* C. being
about 570 ohms.

No. 23 is a small piece of a selenium stick about, 4 millims. long, fitted up like No. 11.
It was annealed in hot sand, and its resistance at 14* C. is about 58 ohms.

No. 24 is a piece of the same wire, made up at the same time and in the same way
as No. 23. Its resistance at 14 C. is about 55 ohms.
