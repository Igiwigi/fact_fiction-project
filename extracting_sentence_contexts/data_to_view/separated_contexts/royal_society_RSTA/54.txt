Then, if the two masses were particles, K would be zero, and (71) would simply be
the usual formula connecting masses, mean motion, and mean distance in a circular
orbit. Hence 1+ XK is an augmenting factor by which the value of the square of
the angular velocity must be multiplied if it be derived from the law of the periodic
time of two particles revolving about one another. 4, in fact, gives the correction to
Kepter’s law for the non-sphericity of the masses. This completes the solution of the problem, for we have determined the angular
velocity in such a way as to justify the neglect of the harmonic terms of the first
degree in §§ 2 and 4,
