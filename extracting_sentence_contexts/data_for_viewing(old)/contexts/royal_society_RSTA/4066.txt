where I(hkl) is the integrated area of the reflection peak (hkl). As film thickness increases, the
tetragonal phase is seen to gradually increase from ‘mostly’ rhombohedral film (200nm) up to
31% tetragonal-phase film (830 nm) towards extrapolated fully tetragonal bulk PBLZST (figure 3).
This may be understood by considering the fact that PBLZST thin films crystallize in a two-
layered structure, as previously proposed by Kelman and co-workers [16] for PbZrp 3Tig.7O3 thin
films. According to this work, grains at the bottom of the film are strongly affected by misfit
strain, due to lattice mismatch and difference in thermal expansion coefficients between the
substrate and the film, and therefore these are compelled to undergo a tetragonal to rhombohedral
transformation. On the other hand, grains at the surface are relaxed and thus remain tetragonal.
As a consequence, the fraction of tetragonal grains increases with increasing film thickness, as the
substrate constraint throughout the film decreases with film thickness.

Figure 4a illustrates the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant, e, obtained
in 200nm, 400nm, 700nm and 830nm PBLZST thin films. Although the paraelectric—
antiferroelectric phase transition has been reported to occur at approximately 40°C in PBLZST
ceramic [13], in PBLZST thin films the maximum of the dielectric constant (¢m) occurs at 70°C in
