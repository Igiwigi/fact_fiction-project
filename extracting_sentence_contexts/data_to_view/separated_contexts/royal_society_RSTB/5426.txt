Two pairs of hypoglossal foramina. Of these features, 1, 2, 6 and 7 are certainly to be regarded as primitive, and the
same is probably true of 3. The most striking fact when comparing the chondrocranium
of the rabbit with those of other mammals is, on the one hand, its dissimilarity to that
of the Insectivora (â€˜Tupaia, Erinaceus, Talpa, and Sorex). and on the other, its resem-
blance to that of the Primates. None of the seven features enumerated above is present in the Insectivores, except
the ala hypochiasmatica in Erinaceus and the paracondylar process in Talpa, each
of which structures is reduced in these forms.
