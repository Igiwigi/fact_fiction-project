by BrewsTER and ARaco, the reflected ray has no sensible influence on the medium ;
for were it otherwise, we ought in an accurate theory of resonance to find a differ-
ence in the values of s and s', as we do in the intensities of the primary and secondary
waves, both reflected and refracted, and we have already seen that such difference of
values will vitiate the law for the secondary reflected ray. It makes all the differ-
ence in the world, whether the vis viva be supposed to be communicated to the
medium at the very instant of the shock, or immediately afterwards ; in the first case
it will be due partly to the reflected and partly to the refracted rays, in the latter
case it, will be due almost entirely to the refracted rays. In all cases, however, it
is natural to snppose that the refracted rays are chiefly instrumental, and this is
indicated by the equality of s and & in isotropical media, without which equality the
laws of FresxEL, BrewsTER and ARaco, could not, according to the present theory,
be accurately, though they might very well be approztmately true, as in fact they
would be if s y, though different from each other, were very small compared with
unity. In clear transparent media, where there is little absorption, s and s are pro-
bably very small, and such being the case, the aboye law of brightness ought to hold,
independent of the equality s=s.

In the first place, it will be remarked that these differ from the value which is
usually adopted, namely, =
