In this section (Plate 16, fig. 6) we ee many things brought into view which may
help in the comprehension of this remarkable type of cranio-facial skeleton. Muscular
segments and their interseptal fibrous tracts are found running over the brain up to
the naxal 8c (1a., ol.); the brain mass (C.) insensibly passes into the myclon (my.),
which latter is 8upported by the large notochord (nc.). This figure shows the vacuoles

ending some distance behind the thick sheath ; this appearance is due to the fact
that the section was nob quite in the middle : the proper structure of the notochord
ends opposite the middle of the ear capsules. The capsule (au.) is shown in section
near the meatus, 80 that, its thickness appears greater than it is in reality, as the para-
chordal cartilage thickens it on the inside. The folds of the nasal capsules (na., ol.)
are brought into view, and the cartilages (29.), both of the capsule itself (ol.) and of
the external nasal tube (e.9.7.) are cut through, very near the mid-line. A continuous
- passage is seen from the external opening (e.9.) of the nasal passage (7.p.) to the fringed
lips of the naso-palatine canal (p.1.c.) which opens at the mid-line at the fore part of the
velum (v1.), here shown in section, with a point of cartilage in it, here and there, caught
by the razor. The s8ize of the cavity and the character of the folds inside it, of the
fore part of the naso-palatine canal (p.7.c.) are 8een in this section, and also that these
lie on the floor of the skull, between the hind intertrabecula (p.4.tr.) and the brain (C.)
