skull' takes place just as the milk tusks begin to extend
themselves beyond the gums, but the age at which the animal
has at this time arrived is not known.

The -use of the shallow cup, which appears to be an ap-
pendage peculiar to the milk tusk of the dugong, forming no
part of the tusk itself, would appear to be for the purpose of
receiving the point of the permanent tusk as soon as it is
formed ; so that as the milk tusk advances in the act of its
being shed, the other may be directed forwards in the same
course, which is different from that in which it set out.

The facts that were brought forward in a former paper upon
the milk tusks of the narwhal, explained many circumstances
in the natural history of that animal which were involved in
obscurity ; and the observations that are now made upon the


and organs of hearing of the dugong. 149

tusks of the dugong, show that the milk tusks have been
mistaken for the permanent ones, and that the real appearance
of the permanent tusks of this animal is at present unknown.
Having corrected s0 great an error in the natural history of
this animal, we must wait till we are s0 fortunate as to pro-
