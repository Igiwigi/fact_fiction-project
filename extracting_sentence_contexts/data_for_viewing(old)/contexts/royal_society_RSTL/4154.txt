movements of the ribs will cause an inspiration, what an expiration, and we shall
discover what muscles are inspiratory, what expiratory. The shortening of a
muscle is conclusive evidence of its action ; if we find one set of muscles shortened
when we distend the lungs, another set lengthened, we know that the shortened
muscles are inspiratory, the lengthened expiratory. I have not ascertained expe-
rimentally on the Snake that the same muscles act when the animal inspires that
are shortened when we distend the lungs, but I have ascertained it in the Dog
and the Ass. I observed these animals breathe when the muscles were exposed,
noted the actions of the various muscles one by one, and after death inflated the
lungs; those muscles that acted during inspiration were invariably shortened when
the lung was distended, and those that were passive were lengthened ; on the other
hand, those muscles that were active during expiration, were shortened when the
lungs were flaccid. This fact rendered it unnecessary to find out by further vivisec-
tions the actions of the respiratory muscles, they could be ascertained leisurely on
the aead body and represented by accurate drawings; such drawings I have made
by aid of the tracing-frame recommended to me by Dr. HopexinÂ®*. 'These drawings
exhibit the changes effected in the form of the chest, the direction of the ribs, and
the length of the various respiratory muscles in inspiration and expiration.

In the Snake all the ribs have similar motions and similar muscles by which the
motions are effected.

5. On inspiration, or rather on distending the lungs, for I never noticed a snake
inspire, the ribs are raised at their free extremity and throughout their whole course.
The range of motion of the free end is greatest, that end being most remote from the
