In the lower curve of the above figure are represented the Sphaerechinus body
length measurements. ‘hese are much fewer in number, only twelve series being
made altogether. For reasons given above, these values were not corrected for the
temperature factor. It will be seen that in the first place variations in maturity, as
evidenced by variations in the size of the larvee, are much smaller than in the case of

Strongylocentrotus. One may, in fact, reasonably doubt whether they exist at
and whether the existing variations may not be referred to changes in the environmen’
conditions, and to experimental error. Also the maturity of the echinoids themsel
was not noticed to undergo any definite and well-marked variations with the
Sometimes, it is true, they were in better condition than at others, but this see
to be more or less a matter of chance. The values representing the percentages o
ova reaching the pluteus stage seem to show that the maturity is least in the
summer months, but that after the middle of November it reaches its maximum and
then remains fairly constant. Probably, however, the low values obtained in the
summer are due in part to the high temperature of the water in which the larve

developed.
