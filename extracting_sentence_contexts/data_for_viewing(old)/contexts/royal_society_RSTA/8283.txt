added to the main proportion determined in the second titration with permanganate,
thus giving the percentage of total iron.

The iron determination was in every case made in duplicate, and, considering that
0-27 gram was taken, evidently the quantity of N/20 permanganate required
would be nearly 100 ¢.c. A discrepancy of 0-1 or 0-2 ¢.c. would, therefore, represent
an uncertainty of 0-1 or 0-2 per cent. of iron.

The figure for iron, therefore, is subject to a greater percentage error than that for
any one of the other elements, but, nevertheless, its accuracy was obviously sufficient
to preclude the missing of any significant amount of special alloying metal when the
total of all elements found exceeded, say, 99-6 per cent. This was nearly always the
case, and in view of the fact that direct tests were made to prove the absence of other
elements than those actually found and determined, it is seen that the concordant
testimony of the two lines of evidence is sufficiently conclusive to establish the sub-
stantial accuracy of the analyses.

The examination of the precipitate filtered off after adding hydrogen sulphide, inelud-
ing the portion originally insoluble in the sulphuric acid, disclosed in different samples
the metals copper, gold, silver, platinum and rhodium. Tests were made for palladium,
osmium and iridium, also tin, but none of these metals was found.

The weight of the precipitate just mentioned, after ignition, would roughly indicate
the total quantity of the metals referred to, except in the case of copper which would
be weighed as oxide. It may be seen, therefore, that with determinations of iron in
