The polytopes associated with NMHV amplitudes are in fact four-dimensional, living in a
CP*. An extra dimension is added to twistor space to take care of the range of possible helicity
allocations. This CP* geometry was sketched by Hodges [21] and further developed by Mason &
Skinner [22] and Arkani-Hamed et al. [23]. This work also showed that the new momentum-
twistor picture is entirely consistent with the Grassmannian picture as developed in the original
twistor space.

Naturally, the emergence of these concepts did not take place in isolation from other major
developments. The influence of super-string theory, without which the application of twistor
geometry to amplitudes would not have made progress, has already been noted. Another parallel
development is the reformulation of twistor Lagrangians, or action principles. Penrose [5] had
in fact derived the early twistor diagrams from a consideration of twistor Hamiltonians. The
Witten twistor-string model stimulated a revival of this approach, notably by Lionel Mason
and collaborators. This work has been able to draw on and extend the vast body of work in
algebraic geometry built up between 1970 and 2000 to explore the twistor representation. It has
also brought in another important idea from field theory, influenced by dualities in string theory,
that of the Wilson loop [24]. This is important as Wilson loops are related to AdS/CFT formalism
and so make contact with an actual non-perturbative scattering theory. These authors have shown
momentum-twistor geometry to be particularly useful for Wilson loop evaluation and hence
another way of generating amplitudes. Meanwhile the emergence of Yangian symmetry as the


underlying structure encompassing both conformal invariance and dual conformal invariance | 10 |
underpinned all the developments after 2008. Yangian symmetry imposes very strong constraints
