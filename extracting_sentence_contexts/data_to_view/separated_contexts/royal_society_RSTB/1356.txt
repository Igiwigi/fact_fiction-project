This association with the yellow

olubility in hot water. he figures yielded by analysis of the yellow mixture
searcely differ however from those given by pure uric acid, and boiling with charcoal
will, as before, yield a colourless crystalline product. It cannot be doubted, in fact,
that the “mycomelie acid” of Hiastwerz was but pigmented ammonium urate. The results are practically the same through wide ranges of temperature. The
yellow substance is but a bye-product in the general process of hydrolysis which goes
on in the tubes, appearing at a stage in the process which varies somewhat with the
temperature employed.
