#5 = 177,004, while for the first solution it is 188,099 and for the second solution
192,446. According to this test, the first solution is the required one,* but, as we
have noticed, the two solutions are themselves much closer together than either to

* The theory of correlation will here, perhaps, confirm this result. Professor Wepon tells me that
the first and not the second solution is in good accordance with his other measurements,

solutions are very close together, and neither differs more from the observations than

most normal curves differ from symmetrical frequency-curves im statistical measure-

The contours are so close that, notwithstanding we have demonstrated a theoretical

uniqueness for the solution of the problem (see p. 72, et seq.), we Bee that, from the
standpoint of practical statistics, it is possible for the given material to be broken up
into more than one pair of normal curves. Thus the problem indeed becomes some-
what arbitrary—at any rate till the asymmetry of the frequency-curve becomes much
more marked than is the case with that of the foreheads of Naples crabs. Indeed,
