SKULL FOUND AT TALGAI, QUEENSLAND, 377

Further observations on the position of these facets in the fossil human skull under
consideration supply additional evidence as to the method of articulation of the teeth.
The relationship of the upper lateral incisor and upper canine teeth is shown by the
radiographs of the anterior portion of the palate, which reveals the roots, by the
position of the necks of the teeth in the alveolar margin and by the interstitial
contact facets on the mesial surfaces of the crowns of the canines. These show that
no true diastema existed in this region, and that the crown of the incisor was in
contact with the canine tooth, 7 or 8 mm. from its alveolar margin. The relationship
of the upper premolar may be appreciated by the reconstruction (fig. 4) carried out on
the left side. This reveals the fact that the crown of the upper canine projected
below the level of the mesial margin of the upper premolar for a distance of nearly
7mm. No interstitial facets are present indicating contact between the upper canine
and premolar teeth.

The articulation of the lower premolar teeth with the upper canine is deduced from
a study of the facet on this latter tooth. It is clear that in the closed position the
premolar was situated mainly behind the canine and not against its lingual surface,
The relationship of this facet to the facet on the upper surface of the first upper
premolar on the left side and the shape of the recess thus formed would indicate
that the lower first premolar was probably a pointed tooth. The evidence of the
relationship of the lower canine tooth is incomplete since the upper lateral incisor
tooth is missing. The upper premolar has a crown 9 mm. in height. The lower
