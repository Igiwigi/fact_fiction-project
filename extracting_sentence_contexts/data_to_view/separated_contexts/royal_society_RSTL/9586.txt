Here and there may occur what is little more than a depression of the
surface epithelium, or there may be a return to the complex gland. The mucous
membrane in this intermediate region is thinner than that either above or below it. SWIECICKI, from the examination of hardened specimens, described the cophageal
glands as stretching into the cardia, What we, in fact, see when the fresh mucous
membrane is stretched out is that in the intermediate region the glands are fairly
equally scattered throughout, and are not arranged in packets with intervening spaces
as in the cesophagus, bub that, nevertheless, the first part retains the characteristic
cesopbageal gland granules. When this intermediate region is treated with osmic
acid, and subsequently with alcohol, we find that the first simple tubular glands which
occur have rather large yellow-brown-stained cesophageal granules (ep. Plate 77, figs. 1,
2, and 3), whilst farther backwards these granules begin to be replaced in some of the
gland cells by the small brown-black-stained oxyntic-cell granules.
