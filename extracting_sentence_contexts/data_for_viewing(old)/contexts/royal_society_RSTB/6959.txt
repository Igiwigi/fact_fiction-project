stamens commonly shed their pollen before falling, and I think that in their prematurely
dropped flowers or fruits there would be a fairly definite correlation between the stages of
development of the different floral parts. The chaotic relation in this material of William-
soniella implies that a flower was retained and certain parts went on developing long after
something had gone wrong with the ovules which became completely arrested. The
closest analogy which I can find is one which scarcely helps in providing an explanation,
namely, in the Bennettitalean genus Cycadeoida. Here it would seem from the American
material that the plant had an astonishing chance of dying and being preserved either with
all its flowers as buds with unopened pollen sacs; or else as young fruits with unshed but
nearly ripe seeds. The fact that our knowledge is based on abnormally developed abortions
to some extent makes the relation suggested in figure 1 between the development of
androecium and gynoecium a pure assumption.

2. Comparative“morphology and systematic position

The characters of Williamsoniella now known are summarized. Its stems are slender and
bore ‘Taeniopterid’ leaves, now called Nilssoniopteris vittata (Brongn.) Florin. The long-
stalked flower has a perianth of caducous bracts, free microsporophylls and an essentially
normal Bennettitalean gynoecium. The microsporophylls, though small and compact, are
still pinnately branched and bear little two-valved pollen capsules which appear to be just
like those of Williamsonia or Cycadeoidea and so is the pollen. The gynoecium is rather
peculiar in the apical projection of the axis (though this may be shown in Williamsonia
