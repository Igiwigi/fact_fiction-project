In paper [9], it was shown that replacing noise with high-frequency deterministic excitations
can qualitatively capture the stochastic resonance phenomenon for bi-stable systems. The aim
of the present paper is to compare the effects of stochastic and deterministic excitations on
linear and nonlinear dynamic systems, including systems with multiplicative noise and nonlinear
damping. We study whether replacing stochastic excitations with deterministic ones can be a
viable approach to qualitatively describing the dynamic behaviour of stochastic systems.

2. On the vibrational resonance phenomenon and replacing noise with high-
frequency excitations for bi-stable systems

In paper [9], a ‘deterministic’ explanation of stochastic resonance has been proposed that does
not imply considering the Fokker-Planck equation or directly solving the stochastic equation.
This explanation is based on the fact that stochastic resonance is in many respects similar to the
ordinary vibrational resonance [10] that occurs in deterministic dynamic systems with the noise
replaced with a high-frequency harmonic signal with frequency w > @ and amplitude H. High-
frequency excitation modifies the effective dynamic properties of the system, which can lead to a
resonance (increased response) at the frequency 2. Using this analogy, the stochastic resonance
phenomenon is ‘explained’ as follows: the high-frequency part of the noise spectrum modifies
the dynamic properties of the system, and the low-frequency part of the spectrum acts on the
modified system. Thus, changing the noise intensity, one can considerably affect the dynamic
properties of the system and get a resonance. Cf. also papers [11-13], e.g. in [11,13] effects of
high-frequency stochastic excitation on low-frequency dynamics of systems are analysed.

As an illustration, we consider the system (1.3) with the potential (1.4) and replace noise with
