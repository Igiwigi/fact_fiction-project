A few sections further rostrally this patch of atrophy has disappeared. Except for this small area at the caudal end of the thalamus, the thalamic nuclei
(including nucleus fd of the pulvinar) are all entirely normal throughout their
whole extent. The slight degree of cell atrophy in the thalamus in this experiment
is evidently related to the fact that the cortical lesion was mainly confined to an
area of the parietal lobe which, as shown by Portax’s researches (1932), does not

receive thalamo-cortical fibres. The degeneration in the caudal end of the lateral
nucleus may be secondary either to the involvement of the caudal margin of
PotAK’s “ somatic sensory ’’ region, or to the involvement of the upper end of his
projection area of unknown significance, which he found in immediate relation to
the posterior part of the Sylvian fissure. This experiment confirms the results
obtained by the previous experiments, i.¢., that the main part of the lateral nucleus
(Lb) is essentially related to the posterior part of the parietal cortex (area parietalis,
or area preparietalis, or both) and not to the area post-centralis.
