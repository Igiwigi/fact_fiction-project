valid in an approximate way over the wide range of density including the liquid and
gaseous states; though for the small changes of density induced in a liquid by
alterations of pressure and temperature the effect of the change in the internal
energy and mutual configuration of the molecules may considerably mask the direct
effect of the slight change of density.{ For gases, however, in which the molecules
are more isolated and the changes of density greater, the refraction is found to be
in accordance with the formula, The investigation of Lorexrz§ was probably the
first effective attempt to introduce the molecular constitution of the medium into
the electric theory of light, and so arrive at laws of refraction and dispersion. The
form of the refraction constant was really settled by statical considerations akin to
those here given; but the theory of electric propagation employed by him at that

* The fact that the values of the refractive index for liquids are slightly in excess of what LorEntz’s
formula would give by computation from the values for their vapours, may be an indication that this
averaged field of molecular action is slightly elongated instead of spherical.

} For these small changes, the Lorenrz refraction function (m? — 1)/(m? + 2) is approximately
proportional to that of Guapstons and Dane, their ratio (m + 1)/(m? + 2) being nearly constant; but
it does not appear why the latter function happens to be usually more nearly proportional to the
density than the former, The results of Réyrcen and Zenunper, ‘Wied Ann.,’ 44, 1891, on the effects
of pressure on various fluids, make the two formule in default in opposite directions by about equal
amounts.
