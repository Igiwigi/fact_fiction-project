Minimum Production in Monotremes, Marsupials, and Mammals.

The general effect of lowering the temperature of the environment upon the CO,
produced by the different groups of Mammals is graphically represented in the charts
(figs. 4 and 5). These curves show that the oxidation in Echidna increases rapidly
and in a regular manner as the external temperature is lowered. With Marsupials
and Mammals this increase is less until 10° is reached, when it becomes much more
marked. In many respects the curve for Platypus is between that of Echidna and
Marsupials, whilst the curve for Marsupials approaches in character that of Mammals.

For comparative purposes, it is instructive if the production of CO, found in the
experiments is plotted as ordinates against the difference in temperature between
animal and environment as abscisse. This takes into account the fact that the
temperature of the different animals is itself varying, and to a different degree, in the
various groups of animals.

This was done for each experiment from the data tabulated on pp. 22-24. From
such curves an average curve for the three Echidnas, three Marsupials, and two
Mammals was derived by taking the values for a difference of temperature of 5, 10,
15° C., &., as indicated by the individual curves and averaging them.

These average curves are represented in fig. 6, and the data from which they were
drawn are given in tabular form below.
