This possi- suggesting that this observation is not simply the result of

fact, predicted chimpanzee age about as well as it predicts acceleration and chronological age = —0.56, p < 0.001). Our mean heritability estimate of h*=0.20 is within the
range of estimates of the mean heritability of methylation

nificantly lower than the mean of non-clock CpGs examined
(0.30) makes sense, given the expected high proportion of
variance accounted for by age for clock CpGs.
