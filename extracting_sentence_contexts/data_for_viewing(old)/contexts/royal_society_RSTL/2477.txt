of the needle was in the direction in which the s0uth edge of
the plate moved, and that of the s0uth end of the needle in the
direction in which the north edge moved, referring the edges
to the poles of the sphere.

Having ascertained, that when the centre of the plate was
in the pole, and its plane parallel to the equator, the deviation
due to rotation was nothing ; and some of the first experiments
which I had made having indicated that this was also the
case when the centre of the plate was in the secondary to the
equator and meridian, and its plane, as before, a tangent to
the sphere, I wished to ascertain whether such were really
the fact. The experiments, the results of which are given
in the following table, left no doubt in my mind on the sub-
ject. In making them, the instrument was adjusted, s0 that
the index at K (Fig. 1) pointed to zero, that at G to 19* go

from Q towards S, and those at Â©, o' to zero on the limb
SN, as in Fig. 2. The deviations for the several points of
the plate are those observed when these points coincided
with the southern or upper part of the secondary to the
equator and meridian; and the direction of rotation is, as
