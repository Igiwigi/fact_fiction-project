particularly powerful at allowing potentiation of synapses
leading to suprathreshold activity in postsynaptic neurons
81]. Relatedly, some UP states are accompanied by spindle
oscillations during which intracellular calcium, a major plas-
ticity signal, has been seen to be elevated [82,83] â€”further
potentiating the role for UP states as agents of plasticity.

14. Conclusions and sequenced activity in the
neocortex

There is evidence for repeated activity patterns in the neocortex
in the forms of replay, sequences, reactivation. These three con-
cepts, however, do not capture the fact that there is a general
backbone sequence of firing in cortical networks which is able
to be modified by inputs and experience in specific ways
without wholly disappearing. This backbone sequence is seen
in awake sensory receptive states, natural sleep as well as
unnatural experimental states such as in slices and anaesthesia.
Itremains unclear how the backbone sequence interacts with the
malleable elements of sequential activity but similar trends
may be emerging in hippocampal SWR events as well [50].
One possibility is that the backbone sequence uses STDP to

sculpt synaptic systems to a background state and that devi-
ations from that sequence are used to encode synaptic or
