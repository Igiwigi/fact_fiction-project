of producing such figures artificially has not yet been discovered), be regarded as a
sign of “meteoric” origin, yet the absence of such figures does not prove that the
iron is not meteoric. There is a considerable number of specimens of iron which,
judged by their mode of occurrence and general appearance alone, would be accepted
as of similar origin to those classed as meteoric, but of which the origin, on account
of the absence of the Widmanstiitten figures, is regarded as doubtful. In each of
these doubtful cases the percentage of nickel is either appreciably lower than 6 per
cent. or appreciably higher than 11 per cent.; and the composition is in consequence
described sometimes as “anomalous.” But it is clear that this point of view is
conventional.

The essential fact is that no nickel-iron alloy, meteoric or terrestrial, is known
which gives Widmanstiitten figures when the percentage of nickel, in the portion of
the material showing the figures, is less than about 6 or more than about 15.
Neither of these limits has been fixed precisely, because the structure of an alloy
which gives the figures is heterogeneous and the amount of the meteorite used for the
analysis is generally small (cf. Couen, I., p. 86).

$8. Numerous analyses are available of meteoric irons, poor in nickel, which are
practically homogeneous (CoHEN, I, p. 97). From these it is seen that the percentage
of nickel may be as high as 7 per cent. without occurrence of Widmanstiitten figures.
Moreover, the crystalline characteristics and other physical properties of ‘ hexahedral”
iron (the commonest of the homogeneous types) are practically identical with those of
the kamacite of octahedral iron (Conn, I, p. 85), and, finally, although such iron
