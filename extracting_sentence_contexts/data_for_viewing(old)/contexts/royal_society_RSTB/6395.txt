It will be seen that in each year there is a consistent temperature gradient from
cloudy nights to clear which is to be expected owing to the action of clouds in
preventing radiation. On the average of the three years the difference is 4-03° F.,
which is possibly sufficient to explain the differences in captures in favour of cloudy
nights. A fuller investigation of this will be made later.

The temperature in relation to moon phase shows (as has already been mentioned)
warmer conditions at full moon in 1933 ; at no moon in 1934 ; and at intermediate
moon in 1935.

On the three years combined there is still a bias of about 0-3° F. in favour of the
full moon, so that the results obtained are not due to any accidental temperature
effect, and, in fact, if temperature had been normally distributed the effect of the
moon might be expected to be slightly greater than that shown.
