the several terms of this progression being in fact the determinants of what the
given function becomes when we obliterate snccessively all the variables but one,
then all but that another, then all but. these two. and a third, until finally, the last
term is the determinant of the given function with all the yariables retained. This
comes to saying that if we call the function (suppose of four variables) f, and we write
