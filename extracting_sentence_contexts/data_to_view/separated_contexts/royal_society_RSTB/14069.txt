Ideally, data

study DC in X-hemizygous genes. Papadopulos et al.'s [58] study from Krasovec et al. [74] should be reanalysed using Muyle


et al.â€™s [59] bioinformatic pipeline and conversely. The differ-
ences observed between the two studies could come from the
different gene sets, a methodological issue, or the fact that
Muyle et al. [59] used an outgroup to infer the direction of
expression changes. If the differences persist independently
from the bioinformatic pipeline used, it could mean that differ-
ent S. latifolia populations have different DC mechanisms or
imprints, or that the different tissues sampled and their
developmental stages impact DC (electronic supplementary
material, table S1). Krasovec et al. [74] also studied the effect of artificial Y
deletions on DC patterns in S. latifolia, with the idea of testing
whether deleting Y genes leads to their immediate DC by
simple buffering mechanisms.
