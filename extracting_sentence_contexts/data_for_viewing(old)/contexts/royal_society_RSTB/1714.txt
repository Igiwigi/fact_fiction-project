As each internode must have been, as our specimens show, at least an inch long,
it is evident that the outward passage of the leaf-traces must have been exceedingly
gradual. The trace turned out rather sharply, however, where it entered the leaf, as
shown in Plate 18, photograph 4.

The nature of the “cortical bundles” and their relation to the leaves is thus made
clear ; we have now to consider their relation to the internal xylem-strands.

The number of these strands, as seen in transverse section, is more variable than
that of the external bundles. We usually find five of the latter, never more. The
internal bundles also often number five (see Plate 18, photograph 1), but are sometimes

* As a matter of fact they were drawn from two adjacent sections, between which there is no appre-
ciable change of structure.

more numerous, the maximum number observed being eight, as shown in Plate 2
fig. 1. Where their number is equal to that of the cortical bundles, they all
quite regularly with the latter, as shown in photograph 1.* Where they are more
numerous, we find the reason is, that certain of the single medullary bundles are [
replaced by a pair (see Plate 21, fig. 1). The alternation, however, is always preserved,

That the medullary bundles are continuous with the cortical leaf-traces is proved —
