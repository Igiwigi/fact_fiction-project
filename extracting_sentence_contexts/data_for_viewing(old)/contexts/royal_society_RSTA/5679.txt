Remarkably, at the level of weak solutions of Navier-Stokes, this has been proved by
Buckmaster & Vicol [33]. However, the solutions produced in [33] are highly irregular and, more
importantly, do not satisfy the stronger condition ‘a la Leray’ (3.5). A totally open question is thus
whether any of the chaotic behaviour witnessed by weak solutions of the Euler equations can in
fact be achieved by limits of Leray solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations with bounded kinetic
energy.

One possible way to phrase the latter question is the following. Consider the right-hand
sides div R, in the equation (3.16) produced by the iteration scheme described in the previous
paragraph. How far is such div R, from vg Av,? Recall that the solutions produced by the scheme
are in fact smooth, and so if we were able to produce them so that div Rq = vgAvg, we would in
fact get a sequence of smooth solutions of Navier-Stokes.

At the qualitative level, there are some remarkable similarities between the terms div R,
generated by the proof of theorem 3.5 and what the K41 theory predicts for the viscous dissipation
vgAuq. A first elementary observation is that vg Avg = div vq(Dug + Duj) and that vg(Dug + Dvj)
is a traceless symmetric tensor. These two properties can be shown to hold for the tensors Rq
produced by pretty much all schemes following the one of [55].

A second observation is that, as already explained in the previous paragraph, along the

iteration leading to the proof of theorem 3.5 the L® sizes of Ry and Uq are dg41 and 5! 2 while
their typical length scale is 4, 1 Recalling that the Onsager threshold is given by 6g = Aq 2/3 the
