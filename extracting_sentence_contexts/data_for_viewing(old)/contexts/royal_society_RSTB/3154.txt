of the most posterior one, which was only partially denuded. Many of them were
infiltrated with lime débris, brick-dust, ete.


264 SIR W. MACEWEN ON THE ROLE OF THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS

These pieces, as they were elevated, were placed in an aseptic solution. They
were then pared with a chisel in order to remove the débris. This was especially
necessary over the external surface, where they had been scraped and ingrained with
dirt. They were afterwards thoroughly washed in an aseptic solution, divided into
fragments, and replaced. In this way a mosaic work of 14 pieces of bone was
formed. It was difficult to retain these in position owing to four things. First,
to the extent of the osseous defect; second, to the fact that the dura mater had
been so extensively lacerated and torn that it formed a very irregular floor to rest
the fragments upon; third, to the great bruising and crushing of the scalp, which
rendered it difficult to bring the several pieces into apposition, and made sloughing
of a part of it almost certain; and fourthly, to the force of the cerebral impulses,
which caused a distinct movement of the fragments, producing crepitation by the one
rubbing against the other. It was feared that, owing to these four circumstances,
some of the fragments would be shed.

It is to be borne in mind that the periosteum had been by the injury entirely
removed from all these fragments, except the most posterior one, and that most of
them had to have their external surface pared with a chisel. The soft tissues were
brought together as well as possible, and the wound was dressed.
