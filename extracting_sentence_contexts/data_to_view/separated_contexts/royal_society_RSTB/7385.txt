Nevertheless, there seems no doubt that it is generally preferable to
employ serial sections. It is possible to avoid the determination of the axial centre altogether, for in a system
growing uniformly the plastochrone ratio (r) will appear in ratios of other distances on the
sections, e.g. numbering the primordia inversely as their ages, r will be given by the distance
of the centre of 3 from that of 2 divided by the distance of 2 from 1. This fact does not
generally provide the basis of a good method, for measurements so obtained are affected by
inequalities in divergence angle as well as in plastochrone ratio, but on occasion it may be

useful; a similar method is always useful in bijugate systems (including the opposite decus-
sate), where the distance across the apex between the members of any leaf pair is very
easily determined.
