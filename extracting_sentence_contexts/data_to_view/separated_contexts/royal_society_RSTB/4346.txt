1-4; Plate 55, figs. 1-4), it will be realised that
these implements, though of palwolithic river-drift age, are of the rostro-carinate type,
but they are better made and more highly evolved than those found below the Red
Crag and in other pre-river-valley deposits. The two other specimens illustrated
(Plate 56, figs. 1-4) and (Plate 57, figs. 1-4), though exhibiting the beak-like profile,
cannot be regarded as true rostro-carinates owing to the fact that they do not possess
the more or less flat ventral plane. Four views of each of the seven implements are *
given and their various characteristics are indicated clearly (Ant. = Anterior and
Post. = Posterior).
