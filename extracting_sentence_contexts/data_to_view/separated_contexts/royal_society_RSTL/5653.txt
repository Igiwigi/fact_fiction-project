E To enable us to determine with accuracy the conducting power of all the ordinary
&metals, and of seventy of their alloys and thirty of their amalgams, we had to find out a
-Znew method of determining the conducting power of metals; for the process followed by
2M. DrseRETz could only give results to be relied upon for a few of the best conductors,
Sch as silver, gold, and copper. Further, his process, which consists in having a long
-Zand thick bar of metal, 80 as to allow holes to be dr illed, in which mercury and the bulb
Sof a thermometer are inserted, would have required a large quantity of each metal in a
tate of purity, the labour of obtaining which, even comparatively pure, is well known. SAlko from the fact of mercury being employed, we should have been unable to ascertain
= he conducting power of such important alloys as brass and bronzes, and could not
Shave applied the process to amalgams. E The method which we have followed gives such consistent results, that we have not
only been able to determine the influence exercised on the conducting power of metals
by the addition of 1 or 2 per cent.
