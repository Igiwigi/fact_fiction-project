requirements and growing in as80ciation, there must necessarily be hostile competition
which would disturb the balance of vegetation, and result in the survival of the fittest
and the destruction of the weakest, there is also an opposite process which tends to
maintain an equilibrium. Different plants have different requirements, and if these
be supplied at the same time and place, the vegetation may be of a very mixed
character, and no one plant or set of plants gain preponderance over the rest, till 80me
cireumstance arises to disturb the equilibrium. We have then to discriminate
between the effects of hostile competition and those of peacefal concomitance or
association. Ds CANDOLLE, in the paper previously cited, asserts that all plants within
a given area are at war with one another ; but this assertion, in view of what has
jusb been stated, requires to be taken in a qualified sense.

We have already alluded to the fact that, in the case of various plants growing in
aszociation, the number of individual plants within a given area is generally small in

rtion as the number of 8pecies is also small. The diminution not only in the
number of *species, but in that of individual plants, is usually the result of conditions
favouring the luxuriance of some 8pecies more than others ; and hence the competition
between plant and plant becomes more s8evere. The variety and the number are
Â© reduced, but the strength and size of those which remain are enhanced. The experi-
mental details given in the sequel will afford some striking illustrations of these facts.
Naegerr* considers the internecine war to be the most severe between those species
