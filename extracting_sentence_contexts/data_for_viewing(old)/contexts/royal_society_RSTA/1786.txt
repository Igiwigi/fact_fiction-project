ultrasonic methods are a good example. Ultrasonic inspection methods are usually classed as
NDE methods, and in the case of A-scan, B-scan etc. which assume a prior location, this is
appropriate. However, methods based on, for example, ultrasonic Lamb-wave scattering, also
have the potential to locate damage, even over reasonable distances. Good examples of the use
of Lamb-wave methods abound in the literature, and there will be no attempt here to provide
a survey; however, a couple of milestones will be indicated. Guided-wave methods generally
have proved very powerful in applications like pipe inspection, where the waves can propagate,
and thus inspect over, large distances [4]. Lamb waves are singled out where the structure of
interest is plate-like, and this has proved very powerful in the inspection of composite laminates
[5]. It is arguable that the prediction level is not critical for NDE as almost all inspection
methods involve taking the structure out of service for more detailed analysis or repair. In fact,
almost all applications will be offline. Some element of ‘prediction’ is accommodated in the
general philosophy of NDE, as code-based inspections ultimately relate the estimated damage
to estimated consequence, based on structural integrity calculations.! The important parts of the
identification hierarchy for NDE are thus:

(i) DETECTION: the method gives a qualitative indication that damage might be present in
the structure.
(ii) CLASSIFICATION: the method gives information about the type of damage.
(iii) ASSESSMENT: the method gives an estimate of the extent of the damage.

Two other important distinctions between SHM and NDE were highlighted above; the
first relates to the sensing technology. It is generally considered that SHM will be based on
