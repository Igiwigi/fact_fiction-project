V. Marnematicat Discussion or Precepina Resuts. We noticed above that for equal volumes the adiabatic elasticity is roughly a linear
function of the temperature, and this fact seems to hold out some hope of bringing
all the experimental results obtained under the power of analysis. An inspection
of the diagram shows that the difference between the isochorals actually drawn and
straight lines is no greater than the uncertainty due to experimental errors, so that
as far as the direct evidence goes it is possible that the isochorals are really straight. Even if it should turn out on subsequent investigation that the isochorals are slightly
curved, the treating them as straight lines may be considered as a first approximation
to the truth, and as a justifiable simplification of a very complex problem.
