The French savant
described the two genera Zygopteris and Anachoropteris as distinguished primarily by
the differences between these petioles, but secondarily by the differences between
their rhizomes. In my memoir, Part VIII. (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ vol. 167, pp. 217 et seq.), when de-
scribing a new rhizome and its petioles, under the name of Rachiopteris corrugata,
I gave at some length my reasons for not multiplying generic names for these
curious plants ; pointing out how wholly impossible it was to classify recent Ferns
on any such basis, a fact the importance of which is further illustrated by the
rhizome which I am about to describe. Some weeks ago, my young auxiliary collector, Mr. Lomax, to whom I was indebted
for the Calamitean fruits described in my last memoir, Part XIV., brought me a
specimen having the central vascular axis of M.
