ยง 55. The trains of waves emitted by the molecules of a gas cannot strictly be
represented by (x.). As a matter of fact, such a motion as (x.) will never be allowed
to go on indefinitely ; it will always be checked at a certain stage by a new collision. Nevertheless, if the radiation is so rapid that the vibration of a molecule has generally
become insignificant before the next collision occurs, we shall not be making a
serious error by allowing (x.) to represent the train of waves. We will proceed to
investigate the effect on the assumption that the damping is so rapid as to allow this
procedure.
