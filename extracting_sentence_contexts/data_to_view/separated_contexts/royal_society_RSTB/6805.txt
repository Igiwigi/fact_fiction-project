He is here referring, however, not to the
division product, which was observed by Kent, but to the vegetative form abandoning
its house. Earlier suggestions by James-Clark that the posterior flagellum was a
contractile thread arising at the posterior end were already doubtful from Stein’s
figures. Figure Lf, sketched from life, shows that the posterior flagellum is in fact free
to its base, which lies in the vicinity of the anterior flagellum. My observations do not
confirm James-Clark’s description of a permanent groove from the base of the
anterior flagellum to the posterior end. This I regard as a misinterpretation of the
origin of the posterior flagellum.
