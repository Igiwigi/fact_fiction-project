Internally triggered
human brain images, however abstract, are snippets (expressed as many different but distinct
patterns of neural activity in specific regions of the cortex) derived from stored information
acquired in earlier sensory or mental events, and pieced together in different ways under some
central control (the ‘main program’) linked to human self-consciousness. Whenever a physicist conceives or thinks about the model of a physical system or
physical process, whether classical, relativistic or quantum, whether one-dimensional or multi-
dimensional, his/her brain triggers, transforms and mutually correlates very specific and unique
distributions of neural impulses. The fact that the brain is an eminently classical information-
processing device! that evolved, and is continuously being trained, through information-driven
interactions with the classical macroscopic world, is very germane to how we can imagine,
describe and understand the behaviour of physical systems, either quantum, classical, molecular
or biological. This even applies to mathematics, most notably probability theory [2, §1.6]. For
instance, given a set of mental images of possible outcomes of a quantum measurement, all may
be subjectively viewed as equiprobable by an unbiased observer.
