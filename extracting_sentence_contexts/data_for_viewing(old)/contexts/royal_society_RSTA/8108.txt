The above equations may, of course, be solved for the components of displacement
u, v, @, in terms of the force-system X, Y, N, but on account of the complexity of the
expressions, we shall not trouble to write them down,

We may simplify (80) by a special choice of axes. If we choose the origin at the
centre of rotation, we have u = v = 0, and the first two terms on the right-hand side
of each of the equations disappear. But this is not a very useful choice of origin, because
it depends on the displacement and therefore on the applied force-system. It is
better to choose temporarily the origin at the centre of mass of the fictitious wire, and
the axes in the directions of the principal axes of inertia of the wire with respect to that
point. We have then

the ee es eek teem ets. ss |(SI)

and hence, simplifying (80), we may state the result :

Tueorem VIII.â€”If. in the general two-dimensional problem, the co-ordinate axes
coincide with the principal axes of inertia of the fictitious wire previously described at its
centre of mass. then the applied force-system is connected with the displacement of the tooth
by the equations
