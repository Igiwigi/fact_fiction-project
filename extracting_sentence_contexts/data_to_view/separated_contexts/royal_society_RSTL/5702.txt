[= after death by the post-mortem contractions of the vessels: inflammatory congestion, on
'5 the contrary, is the first evidence of organic lesion, and declares itself as distinctly in
2 the dead as in the living, being the most important if not the only sign of the early

Z Pient meningitis mentioned in the Introduction to this paper. ij Although determination of blood, as met with in the frog, is thus entirely inde-

g pendent of inflammatory congestion, yet it is of great interest with reference to human
& inflammation. Dilatation of the arteries is now generally admitted to be the result of
© the relaxation of their muscular fibres; and that it is a purely passive phenomenon,
