For the tip-dating analyses, a birthâ€”death process with uniform
serial sampling [31] and diversified sampling of extant taxa
was used as the prior on divergence times. This birth-death
process assumes constant rates of speciation A, extinction w and
fossil sampling , between the time of origin of the process To
and a cut-off time f, = 25 Myr. Neither cladogenesis nor any
fossil sampling is allowed between f, and the present. The ances-
tral lineages (i.e. surviving up to the present time) arriving at the
cut-off time of 25 Myr are assumed to give rise to the total diver-
sity of extant placental mammals, which was here considered to
be equal to 5000 species. The probability density of a phylogeny
under this process has been derived previously [55], except for
the fact that, here, fossil sampling is always coupled with extinc-
tion (as in [31]), and thus, all sampled fossils are tips of the
phylogeny. By contrast, the fossilized birth-death process [32],
combined with diversified sampling [55], allows for some of
the sampled fossils to be ancestral to other fossils or to extant
taxa. However, in the present case, fossil sampling is very
sparse compared with the total diversity of the clade, and as a
result, the probability of sampling a fossil that will be ancestral
to other represented lineages in the tree is very low (of the
order of 0.001). In this regime, the tip-only approximation used
here is expected to be accurate.
