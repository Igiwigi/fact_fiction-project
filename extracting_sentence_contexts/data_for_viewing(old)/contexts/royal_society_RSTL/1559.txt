horary motion in latitude - g go

By a trigonometrical calculation, I find that the sun rose
centrally eclipsed in S. lat. 5* g' and E. long. 0 46'. The
moon's umbra then passed over the continent of Africa in a
north-easterly direction ; and, crossing the Red Sea, entered
Arabia near Mecca, continuing its course over the provinces
of Kerman and Segistan in Persia. The sun afterwards be-
came centrally eclipsed on the meridian in N. lat. g5Y and E.
long. 68*. Consequently this eclipse could not be central in
any part of Asia Minor : and yet it has generally been consi-
dered, of late years, as the only one that could be reconciled
to the fact.

Lastly, I shall notice the eclipse proposed by M. VoLney,
which happened February gd, 626 B. C. The ecliptic con-
junction took place at 4* 19/ 27” in the morning, mean time at
Greenwich, or 4* o' 35” apparent time: and the elements were
as follow :
