1,=ab.ac.ad.ae.af.bc.bd.be.bf.cd.ce.cf.de.df.ef, for the product of all the 15 factors,
then the 12 factors are in fact all those of II, except ab, cf, de ; viz., we have

eee = VIF+ (ab) (ef )*(de}*.

Again, c,cgk;ky,=vacf.bde Vbef.ade /acdef beds, is a fourth root of a product of
32 factors, which are in fact 16 factors twice repeated, and in the 16 factors, ab does
not occur, cf and de occur each twice, and the other 12 factors each once : we thus
have

excakrky=v/ Wo Y(de)* + (ab)?,
and the relation to be verified assumes the form
fedeV/1+(f (def + v (cf F(deP=0,

which, taking fe.de=â€”v/ (cf )*(de)?, is right. And 80 for the other equations. It will
be observed that in the equation de,fe.cyc;;cc2+cch;k=0, and the other equations
upon which the verifications depend, there is no ambiguity of sign : the signs of the
radicals have to be determined consistently with all the equations which connect the
cs and the k's : that this is possible appears evident @ prior, but the actual verification
