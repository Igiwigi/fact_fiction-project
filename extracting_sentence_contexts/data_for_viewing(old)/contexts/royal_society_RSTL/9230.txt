the bottom of the vessel, and having the vigour of their swimming-motions greatly
impaired. The tentacles and polypite were strongly retracted, as in the case of ex-
posure to fresh water, and the tissues also became slightly opalescent. Thinking that
perhaps a fairer test would be only to add as much chloride of sodium to the fresh
water as occurs in sea-water, I did 80; but the results were much the 8same. On now
adding sulphate of magnesium, howeyer, to the amount normally present in sea-
water, the Sarsi@ became more active, I next tried the effects of chloride of sodium
dissolved in fresh water to the point of saturation, or nearly 80, The Sarsi@, of course,
floated to the surface, and they immediately began to show symptoms of torpidity, The
latter became rapidly more and more pronounced, till spontaneity was quite suspended.
The animals, however, were not dead, nor did they die for many hours—their irritability
continuing unimpaired, although their spontaneity had s0 completely ceased. The ten-
tacles and polypite were exceedingly relaxed, which is an interesting fact, as being the
converse of that which occurs in water containing too small a proportion of salt.
Lastly, to give the density hypothesis a still more complete trial, I dissolved various
neutral salts and other substances, such as sugar &c., in fresh water till it was of the
density of sea-water ; but in all cases, on immersing Sars/@ in such solutions, death was
as rapid as that which followed their immersion in fresh water.

VII. GENERAL SUMMARY.

The © fundamental experiment” of paralyzing nectocalyces by removing their margin
has this year been repeated a vast number of times on various species of naked-eyed
Medusz, and always with the same result. In the case of the covered-eyed Medux, I
have confirmed 8uch of my previous observations as required confirmation, from the fact
