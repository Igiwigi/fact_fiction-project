It is not possible to assume that ¢ is the
sum of two terms contributed by the two boundary solids,

=a! eo"

and that the sum is the same for any pair of solids because it is the same also for two
dissimilar solids—or ¢ = ¢,’ + ¢,""._¢ appears always to be entirely independent of the
solids. Perhaps the most difficult problem of the boundary state is presented by the fact that
c is positive for the normal reaction and negative for the tangential reaction. The
external force which calls forth the tangential reaction may be taken to be applied as

a traction on the surfaces « and 8, and an increase in the length of molecules whose
long axis was normal to those surfaces would increase the moment of the force at the
surface of slip h/2.
