surfaces, the droplets spread across the surface leading to higher evaporation [9].

A beetle-inspired surface was found to collect more water than flat surfaces with homogeneous
wettability. This is because of the heterogeneity: droplets can slide/roll at a faster rate, and
maintain a spherical droplet shape, leading to lesser evaporation [9].

Next, the effect of smaller particles was investigated. A coating with smaller particles results
in a surface with lower pitch of asperities when compared with the larger particles, which
affects the number of nucleation sites. A coating with smaller particles is believed to increase
the water collection rate because of more nucleation sites leading to a larger number of smaller
droplets coalescing faster. There was an increase in the water collection on the beetle-inspired
surface because the droplets sitting on superhydrophobic spots roll off to superhydrophilic spots.
However, the superhydrophobic surface resulted in no water collection. This is because of the fact
that smaller particles nucleate smaller droplets, as shown in the optical images, which could lead
to losing droplets to the wind [9].

Gurera & Bhushan [9] also performed experiments on various surfaces at 0째 inclination angle.
The data are summarized at two inclination angles in table 4. There was no significant difference
between 45째 and 0째 inclination angles, except for the superhydrophobic surface using 7nm
particles. It was because there was little water collection because the droplets were not lost to
the wind at 0째 inclination, instead they fell in the beaker [9].

To summarize, it was found that higher water repellency in flat surfaces resulted in a higher
water collection rate. The inclination angle (with respect to the vertical axis) had little effect.
Surfaces with heterogeneous wettability had a higher water collection rate than surfaces with
