It is not necessary to discuss the other two modes in which the foetus of the Tor-
pedo is nourished, analogous to what is witnessed in the chick in ovo, first by means
of vessels conveying blood, passing from the yolk membrane, and afterwards, in
addition, by the direct passage of the snbstance. of the yolk into the intestine of the
fetus, through the vitello-intestinal canal.

Whether the foetus of those Squali and Rays which are considered ovoviviparous
are only nourished in these two ways, or also in the additional manner of the foetus
of the Torpedo, is a subject for inquiry. From what I have obseryed, I am rather
disposed to think that they are nourished in the latter manner, though in a less de-
gree, and without excepting even those which are contained in a closed membrane.

From the facts given in the preceding tables, and from others which I have ob-
served, it may be inferred that the Torpedo does not bear young more than once a
year ; that the breeding season is the latter end of autumn and the beginning of
winter*; and that the period of utero-gestation is from nine to twelve months F.

I have alluded, some pages back, to the foetal Torpedo at its full term. Since I

* According to AntrorLE, it brings forth in autumn. In my former paper I supposed erroneously that the
principal breeding season is the spring, from the circumstance that the fish at that time abound in ova of a
large size.

+ I say from nine to twelve months, because I suspect the period of utero-gestation is not precisely fixed, but
that it varies with circumstances fayourable or unfavourable to bringing forth. Thus, I have had young Tor-
