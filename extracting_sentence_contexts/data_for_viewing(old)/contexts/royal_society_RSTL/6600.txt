But this must equal zero, smnce D,(H) equals zero, and since consequently its resolyed
part along any line is zero, Hence we have

I Bo LE =D.

Therefore
Aon! +Bo!+C#? is constant, equal, say, to A. . . . . (IL)
We have already seen that H is a line of constant direction ; and since its direction-
coxines are proportional to Awm,, Bo,, C., it follows that the plane whose moment has
direction-cosines which are propor ou to the last three quantities is a fixed plane.
This plane is the invariable plane. From this fact and the two equations (T.) and (I1.),
PoixsoT's celebrated illustration of the motion of a body which rotates about a fixed
point may be easily deduced in the ordinary manner ; but it is unnecessary to discuss
the problem further, as it must be already sufficiently apparent that the body's motion
entirely depends upon the fact that I is a line of fixed length and direction.
63. On looking at Evutr's equations, we find that, when A=B=C, they take the
simple form
