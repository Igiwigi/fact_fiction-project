The vertical resin canals of the pine alliance are in intimate association with the
medullary rays, these canals forming an anastomosing system with those which occur
in the latter. Their intimate association with the rays is a very natural one when it
is considered that the ray is the source of the preservative in the ancestral forms
which are devoid of ligneous resin tissue in their secondary wood. This is indicated
also by the close association of the resinous tracheids with the medullary ray in the
Araucarinez and Cordaiteze and by the fact that when a parenchyma cell replaces all
or a portion of a septated tracheid the parenchyma is always in very intimate
association with vertical series of medullary rays, a feature which is very noticeable
in studying tangential sections. Krrscu (1911) has recently propounded an
ingenious theory to explain the intimate association between the parenchyma of the
ligneous resin tissue and that of the medullary rays. He studied the pines chiefly,
and considers that the tissue of the vertical resin canals has been proliferated from
that of the rays.
