Subject Areas: It is clear that humans have a sense of number. This is evident from their
behaviour, cognition, evolution, neuroscience, ability to count using counting words, such as one, two, three, ... and counting
physiology symbols, such as 1, 2, 3, ... or I, II, IIL, IV, ... . In fact, Pagel & Meade [1] argue
