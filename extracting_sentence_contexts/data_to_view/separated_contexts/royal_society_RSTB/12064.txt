By using loss-of-function and gain-of- inhibitors significantly delay larval midgut degeneration,

function approaches, it has been recently demonstrated that thus demonstrating that apoptosis is sufficient to drive this

not only ecdysone biosynthesis but also 20E depletion is fun- process during metamorphosis [30]. The precise role of

damental for regulating autophagy-mediated tissue autophagy in this scenario can be appreciated by considering

degeneration in the silkworm. In fact, Li et al. [47] showed its intimate relationship with apoptosis and necrosis. In fact,

that the overexpression of ecdysone oxidase, a 20E inacti- autophagy is activated in larval midgut cells as soon as the

vation enzyme, specifically inhibits autophagy and impairs larva stops feeding at the beginning of metamorphosis. This

the degeneration of the middle silk gland, confirming that is initially necessary to cope with nutrient starvation, but

20E-triggered autophagy is required for tissue histolysis in the larval cells are then digested completely.
