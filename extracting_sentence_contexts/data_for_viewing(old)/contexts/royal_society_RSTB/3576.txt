just as well and as quickly in water which has been thoroughly boiled to get rid
of the air, as in water that has been well aérated, so that it could not be due
to variation in the oxygen contained in the water. Nor is it due to air at the
surface, for the aggregation is more perfect in closed vessels from which all air is
excluded than in open vessels exposed to the air. That the oxygen given off by
the organisms themselves is not the controlling cause seems to be proved by the
fact that the aggregation takes place best in the dark, when we may suppose the
Euglena are not giving off oxygen.

The presence or absence of carbon dioxide in the liquid appears to make no
difference in the aggregation. JENNINGS states (’97, p. 318) that the crowding of
Paramecium is due to the chemotaxis exerted by the excreted carbon dioxide. I
have not been able to obtain any evidence that this is the case with Euglena.
Various experiments tried with it gave purely negative results. Bubbles of carbon
dioxide introduced into the tubes or vessels containing motile Euglenze seemed to
have no effect; there was no accumulation of Euglenz around them as in the case
of the oxygen bubbles, and no modification in the aggregation. The only effect
of the carbon dioxide that I have been able to detect is that, in its presence,
the Euglenze remain motile for a longer time than in ordinary air or oxygen, in
