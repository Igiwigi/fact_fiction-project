sphenoid (0.8.), which appears in the 6gure to be cut off from its base ; this is due,
however, to the fact that this section is through the sphenoidal fissxure. Here the
basal part (p.s.) is spindle-shaped in section ; this is due to the fact that the trabeculz
are here adding their thickness to the solid intertrabecula, and that they are giving
off the orbitosphenoids, which, here, are not continuous with their root. The
frontal (/:) is broad, and curls round the orbitosphenoid, into the orbit. Here the
pterygoids (pg.) are very s0lid, and protect a transversely elliptical space, the naso-
palatine canal (7.p.c.). Above and outside each pterygoid, a 8mall \/-shaped section
of bone is 8een; this is the foremost part of the lower alisphenoidal centre (se Plate 2,
fig. 6, al.s.). The jugal (5.), dentary (d.), and Meckelian rod (31k.), are very similar in
this to the last section.

15th Section (Plate 4, fig. 3)—Here the presphenoid (p.s.) is far separated from
the large upper band of the orbitosphenoid (ee Plate 2, fig. 1, 0.8.) ; its triple form
answers to its compound nature, formed as it is from a bulbous middle, and two
