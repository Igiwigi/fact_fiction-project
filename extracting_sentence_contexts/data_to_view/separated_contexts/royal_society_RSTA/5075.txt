Values shown are bottom shear force (BFX) in wind direction. (a) Reference
case for thrust loads obtained with a fixed rotor. (b) Response with the dynamic wind turbine model (Standard case). (c,d)
Response for thrust coefficient models. (e) Response for a realization of the spectral model. (f) Response for a realization of the
stochastic model. Only parts of the time series are shown. The responses for the stochastic models (e,f) are shown for different
points in time, to stress the fact that these can only be compared statistically. If one alternatively and naively uses thrust series from a moving turbine as input, the response
deteriorates strongly, and the fatigue lifetime is reduced to less than 1% of the actual lifetime
(case FcMoving). The variations in the thrust loads due to aerodynamic damping are exactly at
the eigenfrequencies of tower motion, and since phase factors are not dynamically stable and
preserved due to small numerical errors and discrepancies in the integration, the tower response
will occur at 90Â° instead of in anti-phase with the damping forces, thereby transferring energy into
the system instead of out of it.
