(3) and (4) are very nearly alike. A few specimens among (2) resemble in colour
those of (3), but they are quite different in texture.

216 MR. W. BATESON ON SOME VARIATIONS OF CARDIUM EDULE

CoNCLUSION.

The importance of these observations lies in the fact that, by examining and com-
paring the shells, an opportunity is given of observing the origin of a set of structural
variations in correlation to, and perhaps in consequence of, environmental changes
which are to some extent ascertained, The first point which is to be noticed is that
the shells of each sample, whether it be from a separate lake or only from a particular
terrace, are more like to each other than to the shells of one of the other lakes, or to
those of another terrace in the same lake as at Shumish Kul, where the shells of each
terrace have a distinct appearance and character of their own, and may easily be
known from the shells of higher or lower terraces.

The next feature of importance is the fact that, in the four independent cases—
Shumish Kul, Jaksi Klich, Jaman Klich, and the Egyptian lagoon Abu Kir*—the
shells which have lived under similar conditions, 7.¢., in very salt water, have become
