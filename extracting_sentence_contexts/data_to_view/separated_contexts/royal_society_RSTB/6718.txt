In the field it is suggested that a similar
state of affairs exists. This view is supported by the independent work of both Bawden
and the writer who have repeatedly shown that potatoes experimentally infected with
X¢ or X4 remain immune to either X? or X%. In another section it has been shown that in the field infection with one or other
strain or a mixture of the same is common, and it is doubtless because of this that both
foliar necrosis and interveinal necrosis are very rare diseases, notwithstanding the high
infectivity of their sap, and this rarity is the direct consequence of the protection
afforded by the less virulent strains of X, the lesser evil protecting against the greater.

Kohler (1935 @) states that when the more virulent X strain is introduced by means
of a graft to a potato stock itself infected with a weaker strain, protection is incomplete;
this he considers is due to the fact that the virulent virus reaches the new growing
tissues by means of the phloem. Whilst this would seem to be probable, the writer has
met with but very few such cases. It should, however, be stated that the number of
graft infections effected is a matter of about one hundred compared to the thousands
of plants in which reinfection has been attempted by inoculation.
