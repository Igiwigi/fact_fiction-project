Snodgrass 1928, p. 41; 1931, p. 113) to mark the posterior limits of the labrum. Their
presence here may indicate that a reduced and immovable labrum (figure 7, /.) is incor-
porated with and forms the anterior border of the epistoma.

The floor of the apex of the rostrum, or hypostoma, is composed of the median pregula
(figure 1, pgul.) and the lateral pregenae (figure 1, pgen.). The pregula bears anteriorly
the tongue-like and immovable labium (figures 1, 7, Ja.), which will be discussed later
(p. 258). Anteriorly the pregenae are prolonged into horns, and henceforward in this
account the term pregena will refer to these horns. They lie parallel with the labium but
do not extend quite so far anteriorly as its tip. The hypostoma has therefore a marked
tripartite appearance, emphasized by the fact that the anterolateral margins of the hypo-
stomal area, external to the pregenae, commence at the bases of the pregenae and sweep
anteriorly and dorsally to form the lateral margins of the rostral tip, which in turn are
continuous with the emarginated anterior edge of the epistoma. A deep posteriorly directed
cleft, occupied by the lateral plate of the mandible (figure 1, md./.), therefore occurs lateral
to each pregena.

As seen in lateral view the ventral surface of the labium and of the pregenae are inclined
to some extent antero-dorsally, so that the tip of the rostrum presents a slightly obliquely
truncated appearance (figure 7).

The areas forming the tip of the rostrum are not clearly defined owing to their close
fusion with each other, and in this study, which is primarily concerned with the topo-
