THE OVUM IN THE AMPHIBIA. 231

remaining ova, both in No. 3 and 4, were destroyed. Many of the yelks had begun
to change form within the first hour, and the envelopes exhibited the same refractive
appearance as in the previous experiments.

Anticipating from the former experiments what probably might be the ultimate
result in these, I now determined to put beyond the possibility of doubt, both the
fitness of the seminal fluid employed to effect impregnation and the healthiness of
the ova, and their susceptibility to become impregnated ; and to show from these
facts that a non-production of the embryo in this set of experiments must be dune to
the action of the potass solution, and not to any unfitness in the spermatozoa or the
ova. Accordingly,—

No. 5. P.m. 3Þ 17=,—Sizty-two ova, from the same female employed in the pre-
ceding experiments, were bathed with a portion of the seminal fluid and water which
had been employed in No. 1 and 2, and were then placed side by side with these, in
a separate dish.

At the expiration of four hours and thirteen minutes, the temperature being 60*
Faun., from thirty to forty of these ova had become segmented. Some of the ova
had been injured mechanically, but nearly the whole that had not been injured were
impregnated. - On the seventh day there were twenty-three embryos, thirteen of which
