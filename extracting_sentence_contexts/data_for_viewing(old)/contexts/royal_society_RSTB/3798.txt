in Cordaites do they come off in verticils.

Another feature in connection with the leaf of the Araucarians is the persistence
of its base. This is much better developed in Araucaria than in Agathis and
remains green for many years in some cases, and, together with the leaf or the
remains of it, forms a protective outer coat to the stem.t The “armour” of
the Cyeads, consists of just such leaf-bases and disorganising leaves, but has
alternating with them a series of scale leaves.

The Araucarinee with large leaves resemble Monocotyledons with numerous
parallel veins. The small-leaved forms have only a single vein. Scorr (1909, p, 654),
in deciding on the ancestral type of leaf, says: ‘ That the multinervate character is
primitive (in the Araucarinese) is indicated by the fact that the cotyledons likewise
contain several bundles.” The force of this is very evident when one considers such
a form as Araucaria excelsa, where the adult foliage is so much reduced that there is
only a vestige of the multinervate condition in the leaf trace as it passes through the
cortical region of the stem. Here two small and very short lateral branches are given
off from the single central bundle, which alone continues into the lamina. In the
large cotyledons of this form there are several distinct veins.

Tison (1912) has recently devoted some attention to the character of the venation
in all the Conifers and has shown that dichotomy is a more widespread phenomenon
