F. H. A. MARSHALL AND W. A. JOLLY. 5.—Some Theoretical Considerations. In the present section we shall consider the bearing of some of the facts related

the nerve endings in the ovary. ‘This view has received some support from
STRASSMANN (1896), who claims to have induced “heat” in animals by injecting
gelatine into their ovaries and so causing intra-ovarian pressure.
