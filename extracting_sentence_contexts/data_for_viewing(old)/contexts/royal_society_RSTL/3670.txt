the skeleton, freed from the calcareous matter preyiously combined with it. That
80 accurate, acute and industrious an observer, should not have seen and described
more of the minute organic tissues which are now with our improved means readily
to be distinguished in the tribe of animals that formed the objects of his investiga-
tions, is only to be accounted for by the want of instruments competent to observe
tissues of such extreme delicacy.

My attention has been drawn to this subject from having ascertained, in one of
the sponges of commerce, and in several species of sponges from Australia, the
existence of a yery minute and beautifully ramified vascular tissue ; and in some
cases of the occurrence of molecules of extreme minuteness within those vessels
which appeared to me to be analogous to those of the circulation in the higher tribes
of animals. 'These facts I had the honour of laying before the Microscopical Society
of London, on the 27th of January 1841. The occurrence of such tissues in the
horny skeletons of animals s0 low in the organic scale as the Spongiadz, naturally
suggested the idea of the probability of the occurrence of similar or more fully de-
veloped tissues in the skeletons of the higher tribes of zoophytes; and I accordingly
determined to pursue the investigation, with the hope of adding, in some slight
degree, to our knowledge of the organic structure of the bony portions of the Coral-
lidze, and also of throwing, if possible, further light upon the till contested place in
the scale of created beings of the sponge tribe. With this view, I submitted small
portions of nearly seyenty species of bony corals to the action of dilute muriatic acid,
and from thirty-five of these I have succeeded in obtaining the animal tissues in a
