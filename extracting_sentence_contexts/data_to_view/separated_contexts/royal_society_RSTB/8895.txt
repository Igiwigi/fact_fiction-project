The fact that the intensities are a
function of only three parameters means that the p-dimensional
vector tips all lie on a three-dimensional hypersurface
(‘manifold’) in the p-dimensional space of intensities
(figure 1). This manifold is an expression of the correlated
way in which the pixel intensities change with the particle
orientation. In fact, each point on the manifold represents a
snapshot from a specific object orientation. Discovering the manifold in a noisy dataset constitutes the
first step in the analysis. Starting with the Euclidean distance
between vectors representing snapshots in the p-dimensional
data space, a number of powerful graph-theoretic techniques
can be used to discover low-dimensional manifolds underlying
the high-dimensional data [19,23—26,32-34].
