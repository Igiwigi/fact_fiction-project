Out of this amount we
have found 100,000 cub. m., or 5 per cent., of the total in the underground water of our
farm. Since the conventional allowance of irrigation design is 10 per cent., as already
stated, it is clear that our estimate of the amount is not excessive. More important from
a general irrigation point of view is the fact that although these canal waves are most
striking phenomena on our farm, and contribute notably to its water-table phenomena,
yet their importance—as here assessed—is actually less on the Giza farm than in Egypt
as a whole. Our inferences from our farm cannot therefore be regarded as exaggerations
based on the accident of possessing abnormally leaky canals ; on the contrary, our canals
seem rather better than usual. The east-west gradient reversal already mentioned is brought out more clearly
in fig. 37, p. 370, by joining wave-crests and wave-troughs as in fig. 36.
