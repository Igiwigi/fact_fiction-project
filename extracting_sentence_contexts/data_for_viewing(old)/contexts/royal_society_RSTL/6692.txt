The published notices of my experiments, commencing in May 1859, had escaped his
attention, and his work is therefore to he regarded as independent of mine. Considering
the very different methods which we have pursued, the general agreement between us
must be regarded as remarkable.

The starting-point of Professor Macyus's investigation was the interesting experiment
of Mr. Grovs, in which a platinum wire raised to whiteness by an electric current is
snddenly cooled by an atmosphere of hydrogen. This action, which we have hitherto
been disposed to attribute to the mobility of hydrogen, and its consequent high con-
vective power, Professxor MAGNUS was led to regard as an effect of conduction ; and the
thought induced him to examine the conductibility of gases generally. The mode of
experiment adopted led him, not I think to the establishment of gaseous conductivity,
but to results substantially the same as those that T had previously obtained. In fact

RADIATION OF HEAT BY GASEOUS MATTER. 87

the yery experiments devised to show conductivity showed im a very striking manner
the existence of athermancy, or opacity to radiant heat, in the case of a considerable
number of gases.

The experiments on radiation, where obscure heat was made use of, were thus con-
ducted. Two glass vessels, one much larger than the other, had their bottoms fused
