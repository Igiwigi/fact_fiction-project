Every collar-cell, he supposes, runs through a definite cycle of development :
starting as a simple flagellate cell, it later develops a collar, and, finally, withdrawing
both collar and flagellum, becomes ameeboid. Following out this idea, he can bring
practically any observations on the structure of the larvee into line with his theory ;
for instance, in the amphiblastula he simply assumes that one half has advanced
further in this cycle than the other. He first describes (his fig. 28) a larva of
Grantia compressa entirely composed of flagellated cells (a parenchymula, in fact) ;
this he explains as a very early stage. In reality, it presumably belongs to some
other species which normally possesses a parenchymula larva. As a later modification
of this type he figures a hollow, oval body composed entirely of normal collar-cells
(his fig. 25), exactly like one of my spheres, except for being rather ellipsoid in shape.
