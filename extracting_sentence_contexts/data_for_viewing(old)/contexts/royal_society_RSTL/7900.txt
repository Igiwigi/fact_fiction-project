The retort is next transferred to a bath of paraffin and carefully heated in it. At first
hydrogen fluoride comes over; and at this point of the process the flow of the hydrogen
requires a little attention. At about 132” C., with the silicates described in this memoir,
the silica first becomes visible in fine flocks in the ammonia solution, and in another minute
the whole is cloudy. In from five to ten minutes the temperature has risen to 142%145?,
and 80 much of the fluoride has come over that the contents of the tube are of a semi-
solid consistency, and nearly the whole of it has in fact passed over. The temperature
is allowed to increase to 150?, and the retort then permitted to cool. The process is
repeated by introducing a fresh charge of hydrogen fluoride into the retort and of
ammonia into the test-tube, and again heating in the paraffin bath. If the quantity of
the silicate taken be not more than 0-2 grm., twice charging the retort is sufficient ;
if it amount to 0-5, three or four repetitions of the process are required. 'The process
must in fact be repeated s0 long as any fresh flocks of silica can be seen to form in the
ammonia tube. Finally, 0-75 cub. centim. of sulphuric acid are introduced into the
retort, and the temperature raised to 160”, the stream of hydrogen being continued as
before®*.

The several ammoniacal charges of the ammonia tube are now brought together into
a platinum dish with all the washings from the test-tubes and the connecting tubes;
and these are now slowly evaporated in a water-bath with continual stirring.

At a certain point of the evaporation, just before the solution becomes neutral, and
the ammonium fluoride begins to become acid, all the silica in the dish is dissolved by the
fluoride. 'The process is gradual, but the moment is easily determined when it is com-
plete. Then the dish being removed from the water-bath, potassium chloride is added
