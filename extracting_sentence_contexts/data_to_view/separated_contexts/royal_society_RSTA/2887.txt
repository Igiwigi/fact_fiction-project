For example, the HIPAA
Privacy Rule allows the publication of personal health records, as long as certain pieces of
information deemed to be identifying have been removed (see footnote 11). This is now
understood to be a weak standard, as research has demonstrated that redaction of identifiers
can fail to protect privacy, especially when applied to information that is very detailed, such as
that found in medical records. In fact, any information about individuals, including information
not traditionally considered to be identifying, has the potential to leak information specific to


individuals [23]. Moreover, this issue is not limited to HIPAA, as many legal standards of privacy
rely on the concepts of de-identification and personally identifiable information. In some cases, the law may be interpreted to require something that is not technically feasible,
such as absolute privacy protection when sharing personal data.
