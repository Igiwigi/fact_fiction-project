the stabilized part at the end of the full record (upper time-traces; covering approximately two recurrent times J = tp + 4).

waveform of a chimera pattern over the virtual spatial domain [n(tp + 8);(n + 1)(tp + 6)], which
is necessarily a stable period-1 (delay) carrier waveform, and not a period-2 carrier waveform
as usually concerned in the period-doubling bifurcation cascade typically known for delay
dynamics. To allow for such a stable period-1 carrier waveform, the band-pass character for h(t)
is necessary (stable period-1 pattern have been analysed e.g. in [77]), since the low-pass one is
known to lead to unstable period-1 pattern, as was reported in [25] about the ‘coarsening’ of any
forced initial pattern in the virtual spatial domain. Last but not least, one could also mention
that with a fixed t,, the impulse response with ty (band-pass) necessarily exhibits a broader
width than without the presence of ty (low-pass). This remark is in line with the known fact that
chimera states are favoured when the coupling range is extended (i.e. beyond the classical case of
nearest-neighbour coupling only, which does not allow for chimera states).

There are also specific requirements on the nonlinear coupling function F(x) for obtaining
chimera solutions. This is illustrated in figure 9, where both the nonlinear function profile is
represented, and next to it, with the same vertical scaling, the temporal chimera waveform. From
the standard fixed point analysis for a nonlinear map defined by the same function F(x), one can
notice the following:

— The nonlinear function operates around an average value centred along a positive slope
of F(x), between two extrema, where an unstable fixed point for the map is located
