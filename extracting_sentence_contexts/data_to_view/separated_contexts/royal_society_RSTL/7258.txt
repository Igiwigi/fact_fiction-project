3, Plate XXI. The ordinates denote the intensity, and the absciss the correspond-
ing altitude of the sun. From the yariation in direction of the straight lines representing the relation of inten-
sity to altitude for the different months, it is clear that in each month a different yalue
exists for the constant, of the formula, which in fact represents the degree of atmo-
sPheric opalescence, the amount of cloud, and the various other factors which, in addi-
tion to the sun's altitude, influence the chemical intensity. That the simple relation which has been shown to hold good when the sun has
reached a certain altitude does not apply in the case of low altitudes, is distinctly een
from the aboye-mentioned figures. When the swn is only a few degrees aboye the
