present in fairly large numbers, and, though they left the bacilli untouched, the
invariably took up spores.

The same was observed when the circulating blood was replaced by saline solutio
(‘75 per cent.). A cannula was tied in the conus arteriosus and the vena cava ant
and the NaCl solution was allowed to circulate under a low pressure for 2-4 ho
and then the Frog was inoculated in its subcutaneous tissue. The bacilli grew i
most cases, and then the absence of an eosinophile leucocytosis was marked, althoug
the phagocytes were often present in large numbers, containing, in many instance
spores. *

No doubt here, chloroform and ether and the artificial circulation cause changes i
the chemistry of the tissues, but it must always remain a significant fact that
the absence of eosinophile cells the bacilli thrived excellently. The result of warming
a Frog for a long time, keeping it for instance at 25° C. for a week or more, is qui
different from that ofa brief warming. If, at the end of the longer period, the anima
be inoculated with anthrax, it is found to be immune as in the normal condition, an¢
now, unlike the case of the brief warming, an abundant eosinophile leucocytosis take
place. Lastly, it may be mentioned here, that in many instances a cluster of baci
was seen to be closely surrounded by a mass of eosinophile cells, with hardly a
phagocyte near. The bacilli were then extremely degenerate and broken up, oF
forming spores, staining very badly or indifferently with methylene-blue.

All these observations tend to show the great importance of the eosinophile cells
in the conflict against the bacilli or micro-organisms.
