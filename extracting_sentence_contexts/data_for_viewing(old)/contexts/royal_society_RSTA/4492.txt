differences in the frequencies did not occur by chance and in fact reflect the changes in voters’
behaviour?

In addition to the overall voting statistics, we present another contingency table 5 with the data
obtained from the Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project. The data provide us with ‘conditional
frequencies’ (that will be approximated by probabilities in §3).

°If one were to go into more depth on this level of analysis, we would have to account for the differences in the eligible voting,
population during different election periods, as well as the changes in their voting activity. It can be noted that some voters
are voting in ‘cycles’ and their voting, activity drops in the midterm elections. Unfortunately, at this stage, we are not able
to ‘filter’ out the voters who change their preference for instance from preferring a Democratic Congress to not voting at all.
This type of analysis can be more easily performed with statistics from opinion polls. Such an analysis is done in reference
[18], based on the data from reference [7].
