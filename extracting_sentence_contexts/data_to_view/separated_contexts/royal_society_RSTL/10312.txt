where e, © are uniform along the boundary. The expression for the pressure at any point of the core has been already found

760 PROFESSOR W. M. HICKS ON THE THEORY OF VORTEX RINGS. Since it will be necessary to obtain the yalue of $, it will be necessary to of
the value of yþ ab any time ; that is when the boundaries are given by equation (51
This will consist of two portions, one determined by the normal motion at the boundary,
and the other (ce) by the fact that the circulation remains unaltered. 14. To find the function x ib is firs necessary to know the velocity normal to ad
boundary at any time.
