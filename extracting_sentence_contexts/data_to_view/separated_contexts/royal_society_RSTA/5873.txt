Using the asymptotic relation Ko(z) ~ //2ze™* as z > 00, we can gain some useful insights
into the mechanism underlying the classical rate. When the quantity 6(Vpp — Vpp) is large (i.e.
for low temperatures and strong exothermic bias), the rate tends to an expression with the
exponential term e~/V88, and we identify Veg as the activation energy. In fact, the expression
reduces in this limit to the classical second-order rate (equation (2.23)) (for a reaction from R to B)
with a classical reactant partition function and an effective coupling given by

At the relatively low temperature of our problem, for which 6 ~ 90 eV |, this limit is valid across
all but the smallest exothermic biases considered. As for the SEC approximation, the classical
sequential mechanism leads to a rate expression which can be written as the second-order rate
with an effective coupling. However, in contrast to the SEC approximation, the effective second-
order rate corresponds to a transfer from R to B instead of R to P and thus has an activation energy
which is independent of exothermic bias.
