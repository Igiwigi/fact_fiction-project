Tf therefore we put (with Sir WrLiTam THoms0N) r=, we have

8 cos vi—g7=;—8 cos of toe [5 a SD}

When we wish to proceed to a second approximation, including the effects of
inertia, it must be noticed thab the equations of motion in the two problems only
differ in the fact that in that relating to viscosity the terms introduced by inertia are

ne1 ag dry O * 5 Pa PB *y
lo WES, whilst in the case of elasticity they are —Wp — Wag — O55

Hence a very slight alteration will make the whole of the above investigation
applicable to the case of elasticity ; we have, in fact, merely to differentiate the
approximate values for «, Þ, y twice with regard to the time instead of once.

Then just as before, we find the surface radial displacement, as far as it is due to

inertia, to be (compare (55))
