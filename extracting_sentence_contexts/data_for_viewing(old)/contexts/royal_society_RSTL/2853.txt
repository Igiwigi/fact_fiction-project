246 SIR DAVID BREWSTER ON THE CONNEXION BETWEEN CERTAIN

colour of a single particle, whose thickness is equal to that of the films of air, water,
glass and mica submitted to experiment. 'The impracticahility of combining a number
of such films, and studying their united action upon light, was doubtless the reason
which prevented natural philosophers from bringing the two series of facts under the
same conditions. Sir Isaac Newrox, indeed, had spoken 80 confidently of the result
of 8uch a combination, as to discourage any attempts to effect it ; and it is a singular
fact that his successors have never called in question his bold though ingenious as-
sumption. © If a thinned or plated body,” says he, © which being of an even thick-
ness, appears all over of an uniform colour, shall be slit into threads or broken into
fragments of the same thickness with the plate, I see no reason why eyery thread or
fragment should not keep its colour, and by consequence why a heap of those threads
or fragments should not constitnte a mass or powder of the same colour which the
plate exhibited before it was broken. And the parts of all natural bodies being like
s0 many fragments of a plate, must on the same grounds exhibit the same colours.”

This remarkable opinion I have often been desirous to submit to the test of direct
experiment, in the conviction that the result would be different from what is here
stated ; but I have been baffled in every attempt to make snch an experiment; and
had not accidental circumstances placed in my hands two substances, in which thin
