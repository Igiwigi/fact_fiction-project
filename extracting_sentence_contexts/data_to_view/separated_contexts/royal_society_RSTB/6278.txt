It is interesting to compare
these yolk pyramids with those occurring in the other Arthropoda. Thus, they
occur in several Myriapods (Hrymons, 1901, Scolopendra ; and others), Crustacea
(REICHENBACH, 1886, both primary and secondary yolk pyramids ; Manton, 1928,
Hemimysis, secondary yolk pyramids; and others), Arachnids (Mortn, 1886,


406 MITHAN LAL ROONWAL

Theridium ; and others), Pantapoda (Morcan, 1891 ; and others), and finally the
Onychophora (SHELDON, 1888, Peripatus novaezaelandiae). This, and similar evidence,
which need not be marshalled here, point towards the fact, as suggested by STRIND-
BERG, that the secondary yolk cleavage is only a belated expression of true cleavage
activity, and the yolk polyhedra are comparable to true yolk cells. With this view
I am in complete agreement. What share then do these yolk cells, or, in some cases,
yolk syncytia, take in the further development of the embryo?
