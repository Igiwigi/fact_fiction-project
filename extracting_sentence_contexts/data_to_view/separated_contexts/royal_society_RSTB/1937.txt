bud developed apogamously, and the absence of normal embryos from the rest of
the culture, render this improbable. Further, the fact that a group of small cells
occupied a similar position further back, on the same prothallus, lends weight to the
view that the division of the ovum had occurred independently of sexual fusion. Besides numerous examples of the apogamous development of a normal sporophyte,
