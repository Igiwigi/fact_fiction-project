The question is then: does the production of cutting tools
require different skills, and different levels of functional under-
standing than the use of stone hammers to fracture casings of
hard food objects? To the best of our knowledge, no systematic
comparisons of stone-knapping and nut-cracking have been
undertaken. Such a comparison is the purpose of this paper.

Whereas much prior interest has been placed on the
mental operations necessary in these tasks (coordination,
symbolic representation, planning and comprehension of
cause-effect relationships), such comparisons are limited by
the fact that each activity is technically distinct, defined by
a different chaine opératoire [36]. Here, focus will be placed
on the elementary actions themselves—the use of a stone
hammer to crack a nutshell and retrieve the nut inside,
and the use of the (same) stone hammer to remove a
sharp-edged flake from a flint core.

It is necessary at this point to describe the two tasks under
study. In both stone-knapping and nut-cracking, the blow

delivered to the stone or to the nut must be an elastic blow,
the total impulse being constant before and after the
blow so that, in theory, all energies are used to generate the
