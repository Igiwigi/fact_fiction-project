52. In (2) it is to be noticed that one more variable, viz., g, occurs in U’ than in
lorl’. The reason is obvious, but on account of the fact, it is easiest to arrive at
formule transforming differentiations of J into the corresponding ones of I’ by first
considering the similar relations between J and 1”.

Let o and + be taken as a typical independent variable intensity and flux respec-
tively. I’ is obtained from J’ merely hy changing every o” and rt” into g~}o’q and
q7!1'q respectively. (§ 7.)

By considering the increment in 7’ and /” due to an increment in a o” or 7’, we at
once obtain
