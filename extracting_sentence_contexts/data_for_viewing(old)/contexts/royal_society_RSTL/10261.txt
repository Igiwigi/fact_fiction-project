d of the peritonenm, a slight extension of which would give rise to a genital duct
e that of Lepidosteus.
he main difficulty of the view that the genital ducts of Ganoids are not Miillerian
s lies in the fact that they open into the segmental duct. While it is easy to
aderstand the genesis of a duct from a folding of the peritoneum, and also easy to
nderstand how such a duct might lead to the exterior by coalescing, for instance, with
an abdominal pore, it is not easy to see how such a duct conld acquire a communi-
tion with the segmental duct.
We do not under these cireumstances wish to speak dogmatically, either in favour
f or against the view that the genital ducts of Ganoids are Miillerian duets. Their
ontogeny would be conelusive on this matter, and we trust that some of the anatomists
+ who have the opportunity of studying the development of the Sturgeon will 800n leb us
know the facts of the case. Tf there are persisting funnels of the mesonephric segmental
tubes in adult Sturgeons, some of them ought to be situated within the genital ducts,
if the latter are not Miillerian ducts ; and naturalists who have the opportunity ought
:Salso to look out for such openings. ,
Z The mode of origin of the anterior part of the genital duct of Lepidosters appears to
Sus to tell strongly in favour of the view, already regarded as probable by one of us,*
'Sthat the Teleostean genital ducts are derived from those of Ganoids ; and if, as appears
Bto us indubitable, the most primitive type of Ganoid genital ducts is found in the
