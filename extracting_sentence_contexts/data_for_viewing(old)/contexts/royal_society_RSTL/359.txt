[4 z+ _ ar

A function of two variables admits of two second functions :
thus þ (x,y) becomes þ ( (x, y), y), and þ (xz, þ (z, y)) or
they might be thus expressed ** (x,y) and $%* (xy).

These express the second functions; the first taken relative
to x, the other relative to y. But besides these two there is
another, which arises from taking the second function simul-
taneous]y relative to x, and y; it is {(v zy),þ (29) pr This
ought not to be written 4** (x, y) for it is not the second
function first taken relative to z and then to y, nor is it the
converse of this. In fact, the notation is defective ; s0me
method is wanting of indicating the order in which the suc-
cessive Substitutions are made. I $hall for the present lay
aside the consideration of functional equations, involving more
than one variable.

Those of the first order have long been known, but the
method in which I have treated them is, I believe, entirely
new. Equations of the second and higher orders have never
been even mentioned ; it is these which present the most
interesting speculations, and which are involved in the greatest
difficulties. I hall first give some account of the enquiries
which led me to this subject, and $hall then treat of the vari-
