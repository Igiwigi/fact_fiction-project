While the characteristic fracture length L is much larger than the diffusion length scale /cT,
where c is the diffusion coefficient and T is the treatment time, the pore pressure diffusion around
the fracture is one dimensional. Indeed, Carter’s model, which is considered in this paper, has
been shown to be appropriate for HF treatments of hydrocarbon reservoirs [10], which take place
on the order of hours. Moreover, in [52] it was shown that, provided o9 > po then a Carter-like
leak-off model is valid even if the diffusion is not one dimensional. However, if L~ VcT, then the
diffusion pattern is three dimensional. For example, models of water-flooding treatments that take
place over months or years must account for large-scale three-dimensional diffusion. Kovalyshen
[52] exploited the decoupling of the pure elastic deformation due to the mechanical loading of the
crack from pore pressure diffusion to investigate the evolution of radially symmetric fluid-driven
fractures that involve fully developed three-dimensional diffusion. In this paper, to develop the
asymptotic analysis required to locate the free boundary, we exploit the fact that the tip region of
a finite HF can be represented by a semi-infinite fracture, which was shown [52] only to be true for
a permeable medium if L >> VcT. However, when three-dimensional diffusion is fully developed
around an HF, a new approach will need to be developed to analyse the tip region.

Proppant transport. Proppant transport has typically been modelled [31] by representing
the proppant-fluid mixture as a slurry. To model the proppant transport the evolution of the
