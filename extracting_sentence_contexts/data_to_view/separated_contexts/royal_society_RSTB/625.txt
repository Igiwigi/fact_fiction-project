I made a preliminary communication to the Physiological Society, in March, 1890,
and showed some animals upon which I had made hemisection of the spinal cord. Later on, in May, 1890, I read a communication to the Neurological Society, and
exhibited the sections. Professor Ferrier subsequently referred to some experiments
that he had made on unilateral section of the lateral columns in the Monkey, and he
found that sensation was retained on both sides, and from four other experiments he
made he comes to the following conclusion :—

‘Lancet,’ 1890, p. 1416. ‘*To my mind the evidence from the various facts
mentioned is in favour of the view that the whole of the sensory paths pass up the
opposite side of the spinal cord, and that they are not contained in either the posterior
median columns, or in the direct cerebellar tract, or in the antero-lateral tract, and as
the pyramidal tract may be entirely sclerosed without any affection of sensation
we are led, by a process of exclusion, to suppose that the sensory tracts ascend in
immediate relation with the central grey matter. If the sensory tracts retain constant
relation with the grey matter this would account for their non-decussation upwards
like the other afferent tracts of the cord.”

My experiments, if they show nothing else, at any rate show that the Monkey
cannot be included with the animals in which the sensory paths entirely cross. I would, however, go a step further, and say that they show: (1) that painful
sensations pass up either side of the cord; (2) that sensations by which an animal
localises his relation to the external objects producing sensory impressions pass chiefly
up the same side; (3) that impressions leading to consciousness of position in space
pass up the same side.
