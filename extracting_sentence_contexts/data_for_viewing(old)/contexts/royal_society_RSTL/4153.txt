MR. GROVE ON THE DECOMPOSITION OF WATER BY HEAT. 21

hitherto mysterious phenomena of the non-polar decompoxition of water by electrical
discharges, as in the experiments of PEarsoNn and WoLLasToN. This class of decom-
positions may now be carried much further, With the exception of fused metals, I
know of no liquid, which, when exposed to intense heat such as that given by the
electric spark, the yoltaic arc, or incandescent platinum, does not give off permanent
gas; phosphorus, sulphur, acids, hydrocarbons, water, salts, bromine and chloride of
iodine, all yield gaseous matter.

Viewing these effects simply as facts, and without entering on any theoretical ex-
planations or speculations, I cannot, but think that there is a remarkable generality
pertaining to them worthy of the most careful attention.

The apparatus I have described, particularly that represented by fig. 5, and the
numerous applications of voltaic ignition which will occur to thoze who duly con-
sider the subject, promise, I venture to believe, new methods and powers of investi-
gating the molecular constitution of matter, and will, I trast, lead to novel and
important results.
