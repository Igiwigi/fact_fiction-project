different types has yet to be uncovered. For instance, the func-
tion of additional proteins like Cas4 and Csn2 that have been
shown to be required for adaptation needs further investi-
gation. Primed adaptation has only been observed in type I
CRISPR-Cas systems even though this process provides a
great protective advantage towards mutated phages that
would escape CRISPR interference.

Another puzzling aspect is the impact of CRISPR-Cas sys-
tems on prokaryotic diversity. It has been observed that the
immune systems protect not only against phages, but also
against other MGEs that might have beneficial effects for an
organism. In fact, the native CRISPR-Cas system is silenced in
E. coli by the histone-like nucleoid structuring protein H-NS
[142], raising the idea that an inactive system may be advan-
tageous for the bacteria. In addition, CRISPR-Cas systems can
interfere with plasmid conjugation and transformation of natu-
rally competent bacteria [43,143]. Several studies show a
negative correlation between the occurrence of CRISPR-Cas sys-
tems and the amount of MGEs within the chromosome, which
seems like a limitation to evolutionary processes and horizontal
gene transfer (HGT) [144,145]. Contradictory results were pre-
sented by an evolutionary analysis that found no significant
correlation between the activity of a CRISPR-Cas system and
the number of HGT events [146]. However, these relations
