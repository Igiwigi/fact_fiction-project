In such cases we can readily believe that the power of motion will be
most injured ; whilst 8uch derangement in the hemisphere must, at the same time,
more or less affect the sensibility. Certain circumstances essential to the study of the pathology of the brain are ex-
plained through this part of anatomy ; first, that motion and sensation should, in by
far the greater number of cases, be lost together, in disease of the brain ; because the
sensorial extremities of hoth columns are in the hemisphere of the cerebrum; secondly,
it is seen why it is that the sensibility, as well as the power of motion, is injured on
the opposite side of the body when the hemisphere of the cerebrum is hurt or dis-
eased, for both columns decussate ; in the third place, the anatomy of the origin or
root of the fifth nerye explains very satisfactorily why, in palsy, the privation of sen-
8ibility of the side of the face corresponds with that of the body. My paper should perhaps have terminated here, with these demonstrable facts, but
I am tempted to reach a little further. Further examination of the relation between the Brain and Spinal Marrow. Other questions will be suggested in reference to the sxymptoms of disease in the
brain.
