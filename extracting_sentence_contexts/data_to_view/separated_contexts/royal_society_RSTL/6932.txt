The connected branch at each ensp crosses the axis of z, sweeps
conyexly towards the axis of 2, arrives at a minimum distance from it, and then goes off

to infinity. The value 4; for #® corresponds to —Þ for , and gives, as it ought to do, the cusp-
node. In fact the values Þ=—#, @=—2 correspond respectively to a cuspidal and to

a cusp-nodal line in the limiting surface whose sections we haye been considering. When the cutting plane is that of D itself, the section becomes a double cubic para-
bola and a single cubical parabola crossing each other at the origin.

(7) Let & be an infinitesimal, and P=1-+e; then

—e (2+8)s*

Hence at either cusp the branch the further removed from the axis of & corresponds to the yalues of #* be-
tween 1 and >, and the inferior branch to its values between 1 and +; 80 that the order of continuity of the
five branches of the curye may be read as follows :—from the infinite point in the higher branch of the upper
pair to its cus; thence to the infinite point in the connected branch, which is contiguous to the infinite point
in the opposite extremity of the middle branch ; thence along this branch to its contrary infinite extremity ;
thence to the infinite point in the upper branch of the inferior pair; along that branch to its cusp ; and thence,
finally, along the lower branch to infinity.
