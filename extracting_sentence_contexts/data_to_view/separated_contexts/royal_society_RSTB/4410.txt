The main trend of botanical opinion has favoured, more or less completely, the
micellar hypothesis of NAGrLi; it is a remarkable tribute to the hypothesis that
even quite recently some workers with colloids, such as BACHMANN,* von WEIMARN,t
and Braprorp{ should have made use of some of the main conceptions of NAGELI,
in explaining the structural properties of gels. It has, however, been frequently
pointed out that many of the facts, on which the micellar hypothesis was based,
are incorrect. These facts need not be referred to in detail, but NAGeEnt’s conception
of essentially crystalline character of the cell-wall in plants must be considered in
relation to the present work on wood. To-day, the substance of the cell-wall is
usually regarded as an emulsoid gel. It is, therefore, probably non-crystalline in
structure for, according to Wo. Ostwap§ and to BacHMANN, no emulsoid gel has
been proved to be crystalline.
