Calculation of results.

In calculating the atomic weight of aluminum from the data furnished by the above
described experiments, the atomic weights assumed for the other elements involved
are those which result from the researches of STas and the previous investigation by
Dumas and STas of the composition of water, namely—

O=15'961 S=31-996 N=14010

In regard to silver and bromine a dithculty arises from the fact that the relation
between these elements was determined by STas with metallic silver which, as
Dumas* has pointed out, contained in all probability occluded oxygen. It appears
from Dumas” experiments and from mine, that the quantity of oxygen which may
be 80 retained varies with the conditions under which the metal is fused, and it is
impossible now to ascertain precisely how much was present in that used by STAs,
while the correction to be applied on this account, though small, is nob inappreciable
in its effect upon the atomic weight of the aluminum. Omitting to extract in the
SPRENGEL vacuum the occluded oxygen from the silver used in my experiments would
not have secured identical condition of the silver with that of the metal used by STAs,
since the cireumstances of fusion and cooling would probably not have been altogether
the same, and it seemed best to use silver fully purified in this respect, 80 that my
results might be directly comparable with any obtained in the future, since this source
