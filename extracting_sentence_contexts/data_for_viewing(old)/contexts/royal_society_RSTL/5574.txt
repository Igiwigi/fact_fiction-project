Another very conclusive experiment is made on muscles exposed to great cold. Several
gastrocnemi and half-thighs of frogs are left in a glass tube, swrrounded by a mixture of
salt and ice: after twenty or thirty minutes it is found that these muscles have entirely lost
their electromotive power. By forming the usual piles with frozen and unfrozen muscles
opposed, we acquire the certainty that the frozen muscles have lost their electromotive
power, but not their conductivity. If we operate on muscles of frogs which have perished
in nitrous or hydrosulphuric acid, we obtain the same results as from frozen museles.


PROFESSOR MATTEUCCT'S ELECTRO-PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCHES. 135

Before quitting this subject, 1 gladly avail myself of this opportunity of mentioning an
important fact discovered by M. Du Bots ReyMoxd. From the period of my earliest re-
searches in electro-physiology, I had vainly endeavoured to obtain electrical phenomena
from the nerves of a living animal, or of one recently killed; and even now it is demonstrated,
that, notwithstanding the use of the most delicate modern galvanometers, no sign of elec-
trical current is to be obtained from a nerve laid bare in a living animal and left in its
natural state, M. Du Bois ReymonD has, nevertheless, demonstrated, and the fact is
easily verified with a very delicate galvanometer, that a piece of nerve detached from a
living animal prepared and disposed in the same way as a half-thigh, in the circuit of the
galvanometer, produces constantly an electric current, which, like that of the muscle, is
directed from the surface of the nerve to the interior in the galvanometer. I have proved,
by experiments made on pieces cut from the lumbar nerves of a frog, that the intensity
of the current of the nerves increases with the number of elements united to form a pile,
and that a pile of five or six of these elements acts on the nerve of a galvanoscopic frog
