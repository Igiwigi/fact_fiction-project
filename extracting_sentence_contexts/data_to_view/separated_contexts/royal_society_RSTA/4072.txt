These studies

are presented along with an analytical examination
of the stability of a single fibre. As a result of the
experimental and analytical studies, the stiffness of
the matrix and fibre as well as their bonding, the
hierarchical analysis, fibre microbuckling, initial fibre orientation and the fibre diameter have
analytical approach the highest impact on the failure initiation. All these
facts lead to a premature fibre-matrix debonding with

composites.
