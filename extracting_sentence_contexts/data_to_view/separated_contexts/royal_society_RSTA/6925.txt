This large fall in
intensity, however, always occupies an energy range of at least 1 eV; it isnot sufficiently
sharp to show the (L,—L,) doubling. Also, on the short wave-length side of this
‘false’ emission edge, other comparatively sharp features of the band are to be found. These are weak, but they are in fact sharper than the false edge already mentioned. Thus, in the case of Si, P and S a drop in intensity occurs sufficiently quickly to show
the (L,—Z,) separation with certainty. This characteristic, which the present work is
the first to establish, will be designated as the main ‘band end’; further band ends,
too weak to show (L,—L,) doubling seem always to appear at even shorter wave-
lengths.
