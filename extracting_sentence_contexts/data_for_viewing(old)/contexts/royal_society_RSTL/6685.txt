circle the mean direction of the marked end of the magnet will be magnetic north, but
will have every possble diversity of geographical direction. At 8 A.M. the deflection due
to the solar-diurnal variation will be everywhere to the magnetic east, and at 2 P.M. to
the magnetic west ; whilst at both hours it will have at different points in the periphery
of the circle every possible diversity of geographical direction. Likewise the movement
from 8 A.M. to 2 P.M. will be, at every point in the periphery, from the magnetic east to
the magnetic west, whilst geographically it will have every possible diversity.

It is obvious that what is here stated of points taken in the periphery of the circle is
equally true of every point taken in the interior of the circle, until the point of 90* of
dip is 80 nearly approached as to render the horizontal magnet absolutely astatic.

The facts of the solar-diurnal variation at Port Kennedy and Point Barrow, after the
elimination of the larger disturbances, furnish a practical exemplification of the justice
of this description in all its details.


662 MAJOR-GENERAL SABINE ON THE RESULTS OF HOURLY OBSERVATIONS

The magnitude of the disturbance-diurnal variation at Port Kennedy and Point Bar-
row, compared with that of the solar-diurnal variation about the hours when the diurnal
inequality (which is the resultant of the two variations combined) is at its extreme
eastern and western limits, affords an instructive example to those who employ the mage
nitude of the diurnal range in different years as a means of tracing the epochs of maxi-
mum and minimum of the magnetic variation in the decennial period. Referring to
