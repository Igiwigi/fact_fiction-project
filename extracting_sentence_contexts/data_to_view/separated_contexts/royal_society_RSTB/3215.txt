G. Hitxâ€™st recent conclusion that this organ, when mature, had the form of an
empty canal.{ In many of our sections the parichnos tissue is fairly well preserved,
and where it is absent in others the fact may be accounted for by the delicate nature
of the walls of the elements. Perhaps the most interesting point brought to light by the present study is the
fact that the xylem of the leaf-trace, when passing through the leaf-base, divides
into two distinct strands. In the secondary cortical tissue, which is regarded here as
being of the nature of phelloderm, the two xylem groups unite, and continue as
a single strand during their passage through the wood. The form of the leaf-trace
in the more external tissues of the stem has enabled us to identify the detached
leaves, named by Scorr, Sigillariopsis suleata, as being the leaves of a Sigillarian stem
closely allied to S, seutellata, perhaps even identical with that species.
