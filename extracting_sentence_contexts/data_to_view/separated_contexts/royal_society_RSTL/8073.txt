NO, being resolved into NH, and NO,, ammonia and hydrogen are
= xet free at the negative electrode, while NO, appears potentially, though not actually,
'S at the positive electrode, where it enters into reaction with ammonia to form ammonia
b2 nitrate and nitrogen, thus :—

S . 3NO,+4NH,=3NO, NH,-+N,

S the N being equivalent to the H,, which appears simultaneously at the negative
& electrode. No reduction of the nitrate to a less oxidized alt takes place at the negative elec-
trode. This is a fact of so0me interest, because it is opposed to the hypothesis that a
nascent body possesses a chemical activity not belonging to it in its ordinary free con-
dition ; for here is. basylous hydrogen, at the -moment of its liberation, exerting no
action on the nitrate, although zinc and other metals x0 readily reduce it under various

conditions, including that of its solution in ammonia®.

* Ammonium amalgam als» appears to have during its decomposition no reducing action upon a nitrate,
a fact, however, which may be due to the amalgam not being really a compound of ammonium.



376 ON THE UNION OF AMMONIA NITRATE WITH AMMONIA /

When the positive electrode is formed of platinum, or iron, it is unacted upon during
the electrolysis; but when it is formed of 8#lver, mercury, lead, copper, zinc, or mag-
nesium, it is corroded, and no nitrogen is evolved. The silver, lead, and copper elec-
trodes readily dissolve as nitrates, the copper one s00n becoming coated with an azure-
blue deposit. Mercury dissolves only slightly, but its surface becomes covered with a
grey deposit.
