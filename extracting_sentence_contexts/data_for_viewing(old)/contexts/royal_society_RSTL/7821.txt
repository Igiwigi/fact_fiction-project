logical abacus which I have already employed in this manner. 'The logical machine
may become a powerful means of instruction at, some future time by presenting to a
body of students a clear and visible analysis of logical problems of any degree of com-
plexity, and rendering each step of its solution plain. Its employment, however, in this
way must for the present be restricted, or almost entirely prevented, by the predominance
of the ancient Aristotelian logic, and the almost puerile character of the current logical
examples.

56. The chief importance of the machine is of a purely theoretical kind. It demon-
strates in a convincing manner the existence of an all-embracing system of Indirect
Inference, the yery existence of which was hardly suspected before the appearance of
Boouz's logical works. I have often deplored the fact that though these works were
published in the years 1847 and 1854, the current handbooks, and even the most exten-
sive treatises on logic, have remained wholly unaffected thereby *. Tt would be possible

* Professor Barx's treatise on © Logic,” which has been published since this paper was written, is an exception.
In the first Part, which treats of Deductive Logic, PP- 190-207, he gives a description and review of Boors's
