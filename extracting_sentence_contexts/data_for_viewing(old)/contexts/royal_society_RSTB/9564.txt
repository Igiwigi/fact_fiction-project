However, the distances associated with the greatest poverty
alleviation (more than 200 km) are not the ones associated
with the most avoided deforestation (less than 200 km).
Again, we observe our priors on deforestation pressure play-
ing out in figure 1f. On land near major cities, we see large
conditional ATT estimates (over three times the unconditional
AIT) driven primarily by the high rates of deforestation on
unprotected parcels. Interestingly, we observe the least desir-
able effects on poverty at near and intermediate distances.
As discussed above, the opportunity cost of protection is
expected to be highest near markets, thus insignificant or
even negative impacts on poverty would not be counterintui-

(i) Poverty traps

If protected areas were causing or exacerbating poverty traps, we
would expect to observe differentially negative socioeconomic
responses to protected areas among communities that were
poor at baseline. In figure 1a, we find no evidence that Boliviaâ€™s
protected areas are associated with poverty traps. In general, we
see the expected positive relationship between poverty in 1991
and 2012 for both protected and unprotected communities
