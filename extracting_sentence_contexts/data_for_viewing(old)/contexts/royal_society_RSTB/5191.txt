that the colour sense is by no means absent in any of the Vertebrata, for, as LuBBocK
remarks, “ Negative results prove nothing as to the colour vision of an animal.”* The
majority of the experiments above mentioned were conducted by placing food along
troughs or tanks and illuminating various sections of the feeding ground by means of
different parts of the spectrum, and thereby ascertaining the number of animals which
visited the different coloured areas in search of food.

As regards the Fishes, the results of various experimenters are very conflicting.
GRABER,f one of the earliest investigators (1884), obtained only negative results. Huss,
who made a large number of very carefully thought-out and quite original experiments,
came to the conclusion that all fishes were totally colour-blind. Wasupurn and
Bentiey,{ ZouornrrzK1,§ and ReteHarp§ arrived at more or less the same result,
although some of their experiments pointed to a slight perception of red, by the fact
that the fish were more attracted to that colour than to any of the other colours, but
