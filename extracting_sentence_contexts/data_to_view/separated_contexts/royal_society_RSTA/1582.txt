The values so far
obtained, while differing among themselves, are, in general, lower than the theoretical
ratio for electrons; the more dependable lying near to one-half of that quantity—so
near indeed that the chief interest attaching to them now is in the question whether
their value is exactly one-half or only approximately so. The following is the account of an attempt to re-determine the ratio from this point
of view. The chief experimental difficulty lies, of course, in the fact that the reaction impulse
tends to be masked, or-at least seriously modified, by the disturbing forces consequent
on the change of magnetism. Three methods of obtaining its value appear to be available. (a) A ballistic method (used by Stewart) in which the impulse turns a vertical
cylinder against the twist of a delicate fibre by which it is suspended.
