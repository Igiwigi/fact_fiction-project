Ste adds in a note :—* It is plain that, as BaLrour suggests (‘Comparative Embryo-
ogy,’ p. 324), the double segments have not originated from a fusion of two primitively
Alistinct segments. There is, however, a misconception as to the nature of the ‘double
Begments.’ They are not so, in fact. The scutes are single, undivided, but the
ventral region is alone imperfectly double, bearing two pairs of appendages, just as

ingle segments of Apodidee may bear from two to six appendages ; the differentiation is
grontined to the ventral limb-bearing region and limbs alone; the dorsal part of the
segment does not share in the process.” 3
