mospheric tides during the monsoon in Western India: the existence of four atmo-
spheric tides in the twenty-four hours, two diurnal and two nocturnal, each consist-
ing of a maximum and a minimum tide : the occurrence of these tides within the same
limit hours as in America and Europe : the greatest mean diurnal oscillations taking
place in the coldest months, and the smallest tides in the damp months, of the mon-
s00n in Dukhun; whilst at Madras, the smallest oscillations are in the hottest
months, and in Europe it is supposed the smallest oscillations are in the coldest
months : the regular diurnal and nocturnal occurrence of the tides without a single
case of intervention, whatever the thermometric or hygrometric indications might,
be, or whatever the state of the weather, storms and hurricanes eyen only modifying
and not interrupting them : the anomalons fact of the mean diurnal oscillations be-
ing greater at Poona at 1823 feet, than at the level of the sea in a lower latitude at
Madras : the fact of the diurnal tides at a higher elevation than Poona being less,
whilst the nocturnal tides were greater than at Poona: the seasons apparently not
affecting the limit hours of the tides : the maximum mean pressure of the atmosphere
being greatest in December or January, then gradually diminishing until July or Au-
gust, and snbsequently increasing to the coldest months : the very trifling diurnal and
annual oscillations compared with those of extra-tropical climates : the annual range
of the thermometer less in Dukhun than in Europe, but the dizynal range much
greater : the maximum mean temperature in April or May, gradually declining until
December or January : the observed mean temperature of places on the continent of
India much higher than the calculated mean temperature agreeably to Meyer's for-
mula : annual mean dewing-point higher at 9* 30‚Äù than at sunrise or4 P.M. : highest
dewing-points in the monsoon, and lowest in the cold months : considerable differ-
ence in the dewing-points within very short distances : remarkable contrast between
