the comparable case of Goit et al. [4], for which an increase in energy extraction of approximately
6% was reported. This fact can be attributed to a better convergence of the current results
due to a judicious choice of optimization parameters as elaborated below and the update to a
quasi-Newton optimizer discussed previously. In figure 8b, it is shown that energy extraction
is increased in every downstream row by slightly downrating the first row for all cases except
C3t30. Moreover, the first row aside, the last row extracts the most energy for all cases, since
it does not have to take into account any downstream neighbours.
