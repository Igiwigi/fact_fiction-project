Figure 7 presents depen-
dencies of maximum pNPQ and light intensity tolerated by
50% of plants depending on plant age. It is important to
note that young plants and senescing old plants were most
sensitive to light. For old plants, light tolerance was dimin-
ished by the fact that the photosynthetic machinery was
undergoing a process of degradation, and so NPQ was corre-
spondingly diminished, hence the loss of light tolerance
(figure 7). For seedlings, where the photosynthetic machinery
was in the process of development, vulnerability to photo-
damage was a crucial factor and also depended upon
pNPQ. Indeed, one- and two-week-old plants were about
six and three times less tolerant to light, respectively [34].
