enough, did not exhibit the red dispersion, although it did exhibit the orange and
green dispersions. None of the sensitive principles appear to constitute the chief
part of the colouring matter of this dye-stuff.

68. When some of these ethereal solutions were examined by the third method,
With a lens of shorter focus than usnal, the appearance was very singular. At the
Yess refrangible end of the spectrum the incident light was quite inactive; and then,

n reaching a certain point, a copious dispersion of orange commenced abruptly.
his continued with no particular change for some distance further on, when it
assed abruptly into green. The fourth method showed however that the former
Yispersion continued, and was only masked, in the third method of observation, by a
New and more powerful dispersion of green which then commenced. And in fact
Fen the green-dispersing principle was separated, or partially separated, by water,
Ihe orange dispersion was seen to continue where before it appeared to have been

= 69. I ought here to mention that a similar separation did not take place on the
Addition of water only to an ethereal extract from archil previously dried. The con-
Alition which determined the separation in the first case appeared to be the presence
Sf a small quantity of ammonia, which would evaporate on drying the archil. And
#n fact when a small quantity of ammonia was added to the.extract from dried arehil,
A partial separation was effected. I do not here enter into the question whether one
f the sensitive principles may be obtained from the other, whether, for example, a
-ghemical combination of the orange-dispersing principle with ammonia might disperse
S green, or a green with a little orange. A solution containing a mixture of the same
