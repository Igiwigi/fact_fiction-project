Gills are never placed upon the outer surface of a mantle ;
and if anything answers to such an organ it must be the small space covered by the
rudimentary sbell, so that the relations of the parts are, in fact, similar in Pneumoder-
mon to what we find in Firola and Carinaroides. Finally, new parts, the * ale,” make their appearance in these genera and give its
character to the order (figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, ep). Considering the position and relation of these organs as distinct developments from
the upper part of the sides of the foot, and the fact that their nerves arise, like those
of the foot, from the pedal ganglia, I propose to consider them as parts of the foot
and to call them the © epipodia.” It has been long since shown by Van Bexzpen
and others that they have nothing to do with the respiratory function. In this subtype the intestine opens on the right ventral side of the neck, and dis-
section shows its first, bend to be ventral, that is, towards the side of the pedal
ganglia.

2. The genus Psychek or Euribia offers a very interesting transition from the
foregoing to the second snbtype.
