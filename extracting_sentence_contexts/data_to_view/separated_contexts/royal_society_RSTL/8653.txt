But since in any one of these conditions (19), (20), (21) combined with (18) will
ensure contact at the four points, it follows that the four equations (18). . (21) must
be equivalent to only two independent relations. It is perhaps worth while to verify
this analytically. In fact, if we multiply together the dexter and sinister sides of (19),
(20), (21) respectively, and reject the common factor
