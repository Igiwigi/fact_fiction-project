FACTORS AFFECTING INFECTION BY APHIS TRANSMISSION 483

Ifin Class 1 the aphid had always fed on the first healthy plant, the general trend
of the figures might be expected to be the same in Class 1 as in Class 2, because in
Class 2 it is known that the aphid must have fed on the first healthy plant. If on the other hand certain of the aphids in Class 1 did not feed on the first
healthy plant then the decrease from 2 minutes to 12 hours should be more rapid in
Class 1 than in Class 2, because presumably a larger proportion of the aphids will
not feed if they are only allowed to remain on the plant for a short time. There is,
in fact, little difference in the rate of decrease, though that for Class 1 is if anything
slightly steeper, but not sufficiently so to justify the assumption that all the difference
is due to non-feeding on the first healthy plant. The difference between the total number of B plants infected and the number of
B plants infected where A was also infected, is smallest after 2 minutes’ feeding on the
infected plant (fig. 8), and we know from the curves for the A infections (fig. 6)
that 2 minutes’ feeding gives the highest number of infections on the first healthy
plants.
