The increase with rising concentration is again very slow.
At the higher temperature of 60° lead chloride differed from the azide in showing
no measurable adsorption. This observation is in accordance with the fact already

known that crystals of the chloride formed at higher temperatures take up very little
dextrine from the solution during growth.

Advantage was taken of the tabular form of the second preparation to make a
direct estimation of area more precisely than had previously been possible. The
preparation consisted of flat oblong plates of varying lengths up to 1-3 mm, generally
with square ends. About 1 mg was weighed out on an assay balance, and the basal
area of each crystal was measured with a net micrometer. From the sum of these
