In the estimation of star magnitudes
by extinction, a wedge has been used from time to time by various investigators,

and in 1870 I myself used one for the purpose of measuring the intensities of
the electric light. As a rule, these wedges are of dark green glass which have a
fairly high exponential coefficient of absorption. The fact that it has a dominant
colour at once indicates that for the comparison of spectrum colours by extinction

such a wedge should be avoided. Thanks to the kindness of Dr. GRossMANN, of
Liverpool, I had put into my possession a pair of black glass wedges, and with

these I hoped to avoid the difficulty caused by the colour of.the green glass

wedges, but after mounting them and preparing to use them, it was found that

the material exhibited bands of absorption in several parts of the spectrum; after

graduating them for each spectrum colour, the results were so unsatisfactory that
