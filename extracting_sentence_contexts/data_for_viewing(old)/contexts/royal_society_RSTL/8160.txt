DV The investigations of SCHONBEIN in reference to 0zone throw but little light upon its
ature, mainly for the reason that this chemist neglected the use of the most fundamental

Mstruments of chemical rescarch, and rarely even attempted any quantitative valuation
Bf its properties ; hence it is that we owe our most important knowledge upon this subject,
ot to ScHONBEIN, who made it the study of his life, but to other investigators.

IvE established the important fact that ozone is produced by the action of the electric
Spark upon. pure and dry oxygenâ€”a point which was further and conclusively demon-
rated by the investigations of FreExy and BecqQUEREL in 18524, who also discovered
Fat when electric sparks were passed through pure oxygen gas enclosed in a confined
space in contact with a solution of iodide of potassium or with moistened silver, the
oxygen was, after the lapse of sufficient time, totally and completely absorbed by those
substances, Tt was thus proved that for the formation of ozone oxygen alone is required ;
and these investigations effectually disposed of those theories, based upon inadequate or
erroneous experiments, according to which the properties conferred upon oxygen by the
action of electricity were regarded as due to the formation of minute quantities of
nitrous acid or peroxide of hydrogenh. At the same time MariGnac and DE La Rivs
