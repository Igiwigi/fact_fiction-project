However, as was shown by Rosso and co-workers [22,23], ambiguities arise
in applying the Bandt and Pompe technique with reference to the permutation of ordinal patterns. This happens if one wishes to employ the Bandt and Pompe probability density to construct local
entropic quantifiers, like the FIM, which would characterize TS generated by nonlinear dynamical
systems. The local sensitivity of the FIM for discrete PDFs is reflected in the fact that the specific ‘i-
ordering’ of the discrete values p; must be seriously taken into account in evaluating the sum
in equation (2.4). The pertinent numerator can be regarded as a kind of ‘distance’ between two
contiguous probabilities. Thus, a different ordering of the pertinent summands would lead to a
different Fisher information value.
