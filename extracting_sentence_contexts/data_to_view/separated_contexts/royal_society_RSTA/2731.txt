The study of their superposition is a subject of our future work. This will open up
some new dimensions for energy-modulated computing! Besides, a potentially useful result of this paper in terms of modelling is the fact that Petri
net unfolding can be interpreted as a waveform of signals whose states are associated with some
places in the net. Data accessibility. This article has no additional data.
