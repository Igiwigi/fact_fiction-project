j The next series of experiments was made at the temperature of 31*1, or 0*2 above
=the point at which, by compression alone, carbonic acid is capable of assuming visibly the
Ziquia form. Since I first announced this fact in 1863, I have made careful experiments
Sto fix precisely the temperature of this critical point in the case of carbonic acid. It
was found in three trials to be 3092 C., or 87%7 Fans. Although for a few degrees
Stbors this temperature a rapid fall takes place from increase of pressure, when the gas
Zis reduced to the yolume at which it might be expected to liquefy, no separation of the
Nearbonie acid into two distinet conditions of matter occurs, s0 far as any indication of
such a separation is afforded by the action of light.
