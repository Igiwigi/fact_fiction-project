Now the lattices @-'Q,A converge to the lattice Ag. As (1, 0,1) is
+ As (1,0, 1) is a point of A’ it is natural to suppose that A’ = Ay or A’ = Aj, where Ay is obtained from

Ag by changing x, into —x,. This is not obvious, but it is in fact true, as we prove on p. 337. The difference
between the statements that every critical lattice of K is of the form @Ag for some automorphism © of K and

that a critical lattice with (1,0, 1) as a lattice point is necessarily either Ay or Ap seems to have escaped
notice. A similar problem arises on p. 333 in connexion with the body | *%2%3 | <1.
