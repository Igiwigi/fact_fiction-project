the corpora striata have been more especially involved. Fourthly. The original vice of +
formation, in all probability, affected these two pairs of ganglia primarily; and this _
entailed, as a neces8ary consequence, an interrupted, irregular, defective, and perhaps
retarded evolution of the convolutions of the hemispheres themselves. Fifthly. The
primitive starting-point of the future idiotic condition dates from a period far earlier than
that at which all further evolution ceases; and in fact, as regards the optic thalami and,
especially, the corpora striata, probably from a very early period of development indeed.
This conclusion is obviously more acceptable to the physiologist (because more consistent
with the radical deficiency in cerebral power manifested by idiots) than the supposition
that the idiotic state should be due to a sudden arrest of a previously normal develop-
ment at some later period of foetal life. Sixthly. The anatomical connexion which, by
the comparison of these idiots' brains with healthy fetal brains, has been shown to exist
(in human brains, at least) between the development of the corpora striata and the frontal
lobes, and the optic thalami and the temporal and parietal lobes, has a considerable
general interest, and probably has a physiological significance which may hereafter
throw light on the functions of the convolutions of those seyeral parts. Lastly. The
deficiency in the corpora striata and the as8ociated frontal lobes becomes particularly
interesting when we reflect on the special connexion of those ganglia with the anterior
