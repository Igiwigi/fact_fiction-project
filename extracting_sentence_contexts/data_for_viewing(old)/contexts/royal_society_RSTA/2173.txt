Although partitions are simple to define and the p(1) congruences above are quite beautiful,
they turn out to be notoriously difficult to count. Table 1 underscores the nature of this problem
by exhibiting the astronomical rate of growth of p(n).

Hardy & Ramanujan [3] stunned the mathematical community with their proof of their
asymptotic formula.

Theorem 1.1 (Hardy-Ramanujan, 1918). As 1 — +00, we have

ae et Vm

In fact, Hardy and Ramanujan proved a much stronger result than this asymptotic. They
showed that p(7) can be approximated by means of a divergent series, sharpening the asymptotic
in theorem 1.1. Specifically, they showed that there is a sum of similar terms such that for some
constant C,

p(n) ~

p(n) = Y> Ej(n) +O @)., (1.2)
j=l

Here, E,(n) ~ (1/(4nV3)) -e7¥2"/5 is the main term, and the later terms have similar
asymptotics but for exponentials with smaller multiples of ./n. However, the series of Ej(n)
