The universe
hus seems devoid of antimatter. The mirror-like symmetry between matter and antimatter described above
goes further than the expectation of equal production rates. In fact, the charge,
parity and time (CPT) theorem which is a fundamental consequence of quantum
field theory, states that under the combined symmetries of Charge conjugation
changing the sign of all charges), Parity transformation (exchange of left and
right) and Time reversal (letting time go backwards), all physical laws remain
he same. If we apply this transformation on a hydrogen atom we end up
with antihydrogen, and as all laws remain the same, any experiment on the
antihydrogen atom should give the same result as the corresponding one on
he hydrogen atom. In other words, the energy levels of antihydrogen should
xe exactly the same as those of hydrogen.
