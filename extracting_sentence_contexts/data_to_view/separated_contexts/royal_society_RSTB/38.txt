Trans.,’ vol. 3, 1871, p. 220), and he there, on the then unverified assumption that it
possessed a changing pm‘, made certain remarks on the probable direction of the evolution of a
Diphyodont dentition—remarks which all the evidence at my disposal most fully bears out.

¢ As Professor Frower has pointed out in his paper just quoted, the type-specimen of T'riconodon occisor,
Owen (figured op. cit., Pl. IV., fig. 2), found in the same beds, also shows traces of having had a changing
pm‘, the latter tooth being very markedly retarded in development, as if a milk predecessor had only
just been lost from above it. There seems, in fact, to be every reason to suppose that all the Purbeck
Polyprotodonts had a similar tooth-change, judging from such indications as may be gathered from the
relative positions of the teeth,

modified into the very various forms of modern dentition, and especially as to the
passage from the Marsupial to the Placental style of dentition. The first and most fundamental question that arises is this :—Is the rudimentary
tooth-change now found in the Marsupials the last remnant of a complete change present
both in their ancestors and in those of the Placentalia, or does it represent an early
stage in the first formation of such a complete change, the Marsupials being still in a
backward condition, out of which the Eutheria have long ago passed 4

To my mind it is perfectly clear that it is the second and not the first question
that should be answered in the affirmative; although, so far as I can find, all the
Continental and many of the English naturalists think the opposite—a view, however,
that, although easy and obvious at first sight, I cannot for one moment believe to be
correct.
