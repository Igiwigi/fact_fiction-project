Generally, one could adopt data-based approaches or 3
physics-based approaches, both having certain advantages and drawbacks [1]. Concerning the {8
data-based methods that will be discussed here, the major issue seems to be that for some :
SHM and CM scenarios only advanced signal processing techniques would be able to deliver fA
the desirable results. This is because of the fact that in the real world most of the times the Dw
features obtained from the monitored signals are, in general, also sensitive to changes caused by :
environmental and operational conditions [2]. In the case of offshore wind turbines, turbulence— a
a term that describes the stochastic scale-invariant changes in the flow properties of the air—and, 1
most importantly, the effects of the operational wind turbine control system could influence the :
vibration signals obtained. So any technique adopted, in order for it to be effective, should be
able to take into account these challenging characteristics of the signals and separate them from
any available damage sensitive feature.
