Mr. FauJjas ST. Fox v has however described a schistus nearly similar, which is
found near Roche-Seauve, in the Vivarais. The stratum extends about two leagues ;
and the only difference is, that, according to Mr, Sr. Fon, the schistus at Roche-
Seauye is of the nature of marle, or, as he terms it, argillo-calcareous, whereas this of
Tceland is undoubtedly argillaceous. From Mr. ST. Fox 0's account, it does not appear
that the vegetable leaves contained in the schistus of Roche-Seauve have been chemically
examined, Essai de Geologic, par B, FavJas ST, Foxy, Tome I, pp. 128 and 134+

fact ; but, if it were unsupported by any other, the only inference
would be, that the schistus was most probably of very recent
formation, and had been produced under peculiar circumstances.

I was desirous, therefore, to discover some similar cases, which
might serve as additional corroborative proofs of the gradual
alterations by which vegetable bodies become changed, s0 as at
length to be regarded as forming part of the mineral kingdom;
and, from the reasons which have been stated in the commence-
ment of this Paper, as well as from-a certain similarity in the
external characters of the substance composing the leaves above-
mentioned with those of the Bovey coal, I was induced to make
this last also a subject of chemical inquiry.
