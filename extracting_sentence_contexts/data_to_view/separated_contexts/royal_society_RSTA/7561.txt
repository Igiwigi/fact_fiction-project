If we suppose that by time ¢ = x/f, any of the l’,,-group of diffraction and ray-path pulses
is severely blunted (and interference effects not yet important), then the instant ¢ = x/f,
should be marked by the arrival of the T’,,-pulses, a superposition of diffraction pulses

followed by the S,, of seismology at
t= x/p,-+1?/2xp,. If we ignore a time difference like h?/2xf, in comparison with the spread of a diffraction
pulse, then we have to superpose further diffraction pulses at

We may now be in a position to throw some light on the apparent Sand S, anomalies:
(a) ‘up to about 20° the S-residuals are spread over about 20sec without any convincing
concentration of frequency’ (Jeffreys 1946, p. 61), (4) seismograms of near earthquakes
sometimes show S, as having arrived | to 2sec before the time at which it would be expected
after P, (Jeffreys 1929, p. 98). A difficulty now arises in the fact that having chosen to represent the generating dis-
turbance by an instantaneous shock, we have derived infinite displacements at the time of
arrival of certain of the minimum-time path pulses. We may overcome this failure to comply
with physical conditions by slightly modifying the initial pulse to one of the form
