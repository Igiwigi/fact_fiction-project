conferences) makes any contribution to WOS listings.

Bearing these limitations constantly in mind, it is nevertheless useful to relate lifetime citation
and h-index levels (of people at a late stage in their careers) to other measures of distinction as
follows. Here, in table 1 each entry, listed in order of decreasing h, shows the average score of
three people, over their full life in research, in the designated category.

This must be viewed as a very notional outline, with large variations to be expected for different
subjects and probably for different countries as well. But I do nevertheless think that it gives quite
a useful feel for the distribution of citations with academic achievement. Older researchers suffer
a bit because WOS only started a systematic scan of journals in 1975, though a few papers before
that date do appear in their lists (possibly because they are still being heavily cited after that time).
This is offset by the fact that younger researchers are only half way through their writing days!

To overcome the strong variations between subjects that I have mentioned, the interested
reader could easily construct a version of my table relating specifically to his or her own subject,
using WOS data for known individuals.

(d) Some starting research profiles

Finally, it seems appropriate to have a look at sample profiles for papers and citations of some
researchers covering the first 8 years following the award of their PhD degrees. Four such profiles
are shown in figure 14. These are based on WOS data for real people, known to me, who will for
obvious reasons not be named. They are now at various stages in their careers.
