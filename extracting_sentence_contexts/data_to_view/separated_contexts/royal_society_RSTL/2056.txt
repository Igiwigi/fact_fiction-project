The water is decomposed at both poles independently of each other, and the
oxygen and hydrogen eyolved at the wires are the elements of the water exist-
ing the instant before in those places. That the poles, or rather points, have
no mutual decomposing dependence, may be shown by substituting a wire,
or the finger, for one of them, a change which does not at all interfere with
the other, though it stops all action at the changed pole. This fact may be
obseryed by turning the machine for some time ; for though bubbles will rise
from the point left unaltered, in quantity sufficient to cover entirely the wire
used for the other communication, if they could be applied to it, yet not a
Single bubble will appear on that wire. 329. When electro-chemical decompoxsition takes place, there is great reason
to believe that the quantity of matter decomposed is not proportionate to the
intensity, but to the quantity of electricity passed (320.).
