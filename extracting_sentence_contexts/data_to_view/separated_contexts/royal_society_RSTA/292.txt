We see from figure 6a that the negative-
feedback system settles into a steady state intermediate between 0 and A (something that cannot
be captured in a pure binary description). If the expression level of the system is transiently
increased above this steady state, the resulting drop in the creation rate quickly restores
equilibrium. In fact, the auto-repressed system equilibrates more rapidly than an unregulated
system with the same steady state, as shown in figure 6a; this has the effect of suppressing
stochastic fluctuations [45]. Memory and bistability by positive feedback: we next allow the gene to positively regulate its
own expression (figure 5b). This can be achieved by closing the loop in (4.1):
n
OAD, ~ x= fe) â€” 900. (4.4)
We see from the binary model that this system can have multiple steady states: a gene that is
active will sustain its own expression, whereas one that is inactive will never become activated
(figure 5b).
