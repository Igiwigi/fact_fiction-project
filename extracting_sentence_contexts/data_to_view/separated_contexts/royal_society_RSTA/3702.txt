Similarly to the previous results, MD simulations for
Nat-(Bz)4 and Cst-(Bz)4 indicate that low-energy structures isomerize to form the GM at low
temperatures (T ~ 20 — 25K). With regard to the dissociation of Nat-(Bz)4, to form Nat-(Bz)3+Bz, MD simulations show
that dissociation occurs at lower temperatures than for K*-(Bz),. In fact, taking as the initial
configuration that of the GM, we have observed that dissociation occurs at temperatures higher
than 275 K. The evolution, along the simulation time at T = 280K, of the six distances between
benzene molecules and the four from Nat to Bz are represented in the top and middle panels of
figure 4a, respectively, while the values of Ecfg are shown in the lower panel.

In contrast, the dissociation of Cst-(Bz)4, analysed from MD simulations taking as the initial
configuration that of the corresponding GM, is observed at temperatures higher than 550K.
