Thus, finding a new value for G that is larger by, say, 0.05% from that given in the textbooks
simply reduces our estimate of the Sun’s mass by this amount. At present, we do not have models
for the structure of the Sun that usefully constrain its mass at this level. Adding to the mystique is the fact that gravity is the force that is most familiar to us as people
living on the Earth. It is not surprising that reports in the media of significant discrepancies
between experimental determinations of the value of Newton’s constant of gravity can catch the
public imagination, as the publication of our result did in October 2013 [4]. What matters then is not the actual value of G itself (give or take a percentage or so) but
its uncertainty.
