Timb-bones.—Singularly enough the resemblance which we notice between the skulls
of this species and T7. ephippium does not uniformly extend to the other parts of the
8keleton, the limb-bones of 7. vicina being much shorter and stouter than in that
gpecies, approaching more 7. elephantopus. The scapulary (Plate 45. figs. C, C') espe-
cially is stout and massive. The angle at which the scapula and acromium meet is
much less obtuse than in T. elephantopus (about 100®); the body of the scapula is com-
pressed, elliptical, with both its anterior and posterior sides equally convex ; a trans-
yerse section through its middle would be represented by the figure of a greatly elon-
gate O. The shaft of the acromium is trihedral, with the edges rounded, and with
the extremity compressed and slightly dilated. The coracoid is not anchylosed to the
scapula, and its proximal part (neck) is singularly dilated,-and yery much broader than
the corresponding part in 7. elephantopus. - In fact the differences in the scapularies of
