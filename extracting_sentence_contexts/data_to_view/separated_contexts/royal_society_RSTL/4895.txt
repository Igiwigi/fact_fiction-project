My dissections have
never demonstrated more than one vessel extending back from the cesophageal ring,
over the superior surface of the tube. If it be an artery there is no correlate vein. It
is traceable along one border only of the canal, coinciding with the Spiral convolations
of the latter as faras the anal outlet; no capillary system is traceable at its end ; no trace
of vessels of any description can be discovered in the parietes of the alimentary canal,
According to my observations, again and again repeated, the interior of the blood-
vessel of the Sipunculidz generally is lined with vibratile epithelium ; of the truth of
this fact, extraordinary though it be, I am persuaded. The corpuscles of the fluid
contents of this vessel were found in every species to be the exact counterpart of those
of the fluid of the visceral cavity. They are identical in colour, in diameter, in figure,
and in structure, figs. 4,5, 6 and 7*, But in the fluid of the blood-vessel they are more
numerous relatively to the bulk of the fluid than they are in that of the visceral cavity,
If the true-blood penetrated into the substance of the solids by means of capillary vessels,
there would in the Sipuncle exist no difficulty in tracking its course by means of the
corpuscles.
