Nevertheless, the various problems associated with making, concentrating, sorting and
organizing chemicals, which are now solved in biology by specialized enzymes and regulatory
networks, could very well have been solved by abiotic physico-chemical processes prior to life’s
emergence. For example, the energy-requiring processes which allow cell division have been
suggested to have been mediated by cyclic tidal processes [14], clays have been postulated to
have served as replicase-like catalysts for nucleic acid replication [15,16], various metalloenzymes
have been proposed to have been co-opted from environmental mineral catalysis [17] and mineral
cavities have been proposed as the precursors of cells [18].

The complexity inherent to the production of organic molecules is a logical starting point in
the search for prebiologically relevant processes. One should bear in mind, however, that the
components of modern biochemistry may in fact be the outcome of a considerable amount of
biochemical evolution, and not necessarily crucial for the origins of life [19,20]. Their centrality to
origins research may reflect a form of ‘survivorship bias’, and may therefore provide incomplete
guidance as a cohesive organizing principle. An environment-centric principle that encompasses
different forms of energy and chemical transformations may be a more suitable alternative. The
compatibility of stepwise models of prebiotic organic synthesis can then be assessed from the
constraints inherent to known hosting environments.

One of the most prominent ideas invoked in discussing the origination of living systems
of matter is the concept of ‘emergent complexity’, or the emergence of higher-level patterns of
behaviour that transcend the rules followed by the constituent parts of a system at a lower level
of interaction with one another and their environment [21-23]. However, ‘complexity’ itself is an
ambiguous concept with more than 40 definitions [24]. The underlying challenge is to establish the
