The true ova are
single cells which have undergone a special development. ' The ephippial ova are aggre-
gations of cells (in fact, larger or smaller portions, sometimes the whole of the ovary)
which become enveloped in a shell, and simulate true ova.‚Äù This aggregation of seyeral
cells (one of them putting on the appearance and fulfilling the functions of a Purkin-
jean vesicle, and the whole becoming enveloped in a shell) is, however, the ordinary and
ly method of egg-development in many animals. In the Trematode and Cestoid
Avorms, and the greater number of the Turbellaria, the yelk and the Purkinjean vesicle
re formed in two separate organs.
