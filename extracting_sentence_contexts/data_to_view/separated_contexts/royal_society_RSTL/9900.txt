Larger cells occur occasionally, scattered widely apart, the largest registered attaining
the dimensions of 60p Xx 18k. If these average dimensions be contrasted with those
of the second cortical layer, in the region of the modified olfactory type (Plate 50,
fig. 6, B), the important fact is disclosed that this peculiar formation consists of cells
which attain a much higher average than that of the ganglionic cells. These globose
inflated cells usually average 37 X 32p, and frequently reach the dimensions of
46k X27p. These are therefore the largest nervous elements to be found throughout
the cortex cerebri.
