insvluble in water, soluble in alcohol, ether, chloroform, bisulphide of carbon, benzol,
petroleum-ether, and in olive oil, Its solubility in the last medinm explains how it is
held in solution in oil drops in many cages.

Ib is coloured, in the solid tate, a fine blue-green and green with strong sulphuric
acid, which does not destroy the bands, as they are een in the regulting green solution
after filtering through asbestos, but not in the 8ame position as before. They are the
same bands as those seen in a solution of enterochlorophyll after treatment with
nitric acid. Nitric acid colours the solid pigment blue-green, which eventually
disappears, and is replaced by a red colour. Hence by saponifying ib is elear that
enterochlorophyll differs from plant chlorophyll with regard (1) to the difficulty of
separating its green from its yellow constituent ; (2) to the position of the bands in a
petroleum-ether extract of the yellow constituent; (3) in the fact that while this
yellow constituent gives a similar colour reaction with nitric and sulphuric acids, it
gives a different colour with iodine in iodide of potassium in most cages.

# A similar effect was noticed in the case of Ostrea, the golution becoming more orange after boiling
with NaHO.
