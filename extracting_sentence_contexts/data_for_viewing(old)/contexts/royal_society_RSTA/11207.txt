(2.) A remarkable holding up of the conductivity of the most concentrated
solutions. Thus the conductivity of a 50-per cent. solution at 0° C. is 5 per cent.
of the maximum, at 18° C. 24 per cent., at 50° C. 47 per cent., and at 100° C.
84 per cent.

(3.) It is noteworthy that the isothermal curves for 50° C. and 100° C. give clear
indications that at these temperatures liquid (over-cooled) sodium hydroxide would
possess a very considerable conductivity. The power to conduct in the fused state is
necessary, in order to explain the form of the two isothermal curves referred to, and
the fact that this effect can already be detected in solutions containing less than 50 per
cent. NaOH affords very strong confirmatory evidence of the view arrived at from the
study of the intrinsic conductivity in Part VI. of the paper, that in concentrated
aqueous solutions the conductivity of sodium hydroxide is to a large extent indepen-
dent of the ionising power of the solvent, and depends on the self-ionising properties
of the liquid alkali. If reference be made to the curves in Diagram XIIL., it will be
seen that whilst the curve for 0° C. leads down almost to zero value for the conduc-
tivity at concentrations above 50 per cent. NaOH, the curves for 50° C. and 100° C.
cannot be brought down to the axis of concentration, except by introducing an
additional point of inflexion in the curve, which there is no reason to suppose exists.
