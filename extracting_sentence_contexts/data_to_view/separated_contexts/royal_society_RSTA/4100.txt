The product of K-spin operators describe
the modes in which K spins are interconnected, being able to generate numerous combinations of
MQGCs, depicted in the Liouville space (n, K) [17,35]. Further details depend on the Hamiltonian

and the selection rules. The key assumption behind the theoretical prediction resides in the fact Dos
that the probability of achieving a given combination of spin operators rendering a final state : =
depends only on the number of pathways leading to such state [17]. This can be assimilated to Sy
a form of a multidimensional Galton board [44]. This is justified in a system with an appreciable 2
number of interacting neighbours which remains more or less constant, where their interaction : &
strength fixes a definite time scale.
