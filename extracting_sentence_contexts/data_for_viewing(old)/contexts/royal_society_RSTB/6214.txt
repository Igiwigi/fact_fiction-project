Fic, 13—Graph showing two-hourly mean values of shade temperature and relative humidity.
A refers to Gadau in April and B in July ; C refers to Screen 4 (dense bush, Plate 19) in July.
Lines of equal saturation deficiency (“2 mm” etc.) are also shown,

July—Two-hourly means of temperature and humidity for Gadau were extracted
from the records, and plotted ; the result is curve B in fig. 13. The great contrast
between the two months is self-evident. In July temperature is lower, and humidity
higher ; moreover, the difference between day and night is much reduced. If
humidity is referred to the saturation deficiency scale, it is seen that at night the
deficiency is just over 2mm and by day about 10 mm. _In fact, if we compare the
day in July with the night in April, it is seen that the mean saturation deficiency is
the same, and that the difference in temperature is slight. The mean values for the
24 hours are 25-04° C, relative humidity 79-3°%, saturation deficiency 4-9 mm.

Conditions of temperature and humidity, during July, on the ground in the
thicket, Screen 4, have been plotted in a similar way, and the result is C. The
figure shows that the climate here is more damp, and more equable than that of
Gadau. The mean saturation deficiency at night is less than 2mm and by day
rises to about 7mm. Combining the two-hourly values, the means for the 24 hours
are found to be 25-95° C, relative humidity 86-4%,, and saturation deficiency 3-4 mm.

Further study of fig. 13 shows another matter of considerable interest. Gadau
