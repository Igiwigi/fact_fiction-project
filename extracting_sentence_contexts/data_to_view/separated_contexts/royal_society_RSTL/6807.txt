Gavss's © Allgemeine Theorie des
Erdmagnetismus,” published in 1839, being the year preceding that in which the Report
of the Royal Society was published *. These two works are referred to throughout the
Report as supplying, the first the observational, and the second the theoretical bases of
> the Instructions drawn up for the guidance of those who were to conduct, and of those
who were willing to take part in the proposed magnetic researches by sea and by land. In both works, the facts which had been ascertained were found to be in accordance
with (and s0 far confirmatory of) the theory which we owe to the combined industry
and sagacity of our illustrious countryman and Fellow, HaLLey, of the existence of a
double system of magnetic attraction on the surface of the globe, the direction and
intensity of the magnetic force being at all points the resultant effects of the two separate
= 8ystems. In both works, the localities to which the resultant Poles, or Points of
greatest force (in the northern hemisphere), were traced, were nearly the same, viz.
one in the northern part of the American continent, and the other in the northern part
of the Furopzo-Asiatic continent. To have determined their precise geographical
positions, it would have been requisite that the observations from which they were
derived should have corresponded, or nearly $0, to one and the same epoch, inasgmuch
as one of the magnetic systems is regarded as subject to a movement of translation
in a geographical sense, giving rise to the phenomena of secular change.
