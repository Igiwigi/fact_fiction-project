Indeed, owing to the difficulty of in situ studies,
political decisions on future sequestration techniques rely heavily on theoretical predictions based
on numerical simulations of the problem. To benchmark these models, quantitative comparison
with experiments is of tantamount importance. In this context, one should be cautious about the fact that some experiments visualize
convective dissolution of CO2 due to colour indicators that track the pH changes associated with
