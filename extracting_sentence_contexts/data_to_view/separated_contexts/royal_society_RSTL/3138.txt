about the same axis as that
about which the attraction mentioned in (I.) tends to communicate a rotatory motion. Als the effects of this pressure must recur with recurring positions of the sun exactly
in the same manner as the effects of the sun's attraction just alluded to. Hence the
terms depending on this cause will be of the same form as those in (I.), as will, in
fact, be proved to be the case when we come to investigate their exact value. They
will, therefore, give us
