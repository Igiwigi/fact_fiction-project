In 1840, Bryney (’40) described the
various Lancashire coal seams in association with which marine shells are to be
found, describing what he considered as several horizons in the Lower Coal Measure
series, and giving detailed lists of the beds and fossils contained in them. This
previous knowledge of the geological features of the beds must have influenced him
considerably when he came to deal with the “ coal balls,” as we see in his joint paper
with Hooker, where the authors state (p. 150): “The immediate cause of the
calcification [of the plants] was no doubt due to the abundance of fossil shells in
the shales immediately overlying the coal and nodules.”

In 1868 he published his most important work on fossil plants, and prefaced the
purely botanical portions of the paper with a short account of the “ geological
position of the specimens.” From the tabulated list given in this paper (Bryney (’68))
it is clear that he considered that the “ bullions” containing petrified plant remains
occur in several geological horizons. One can no longer accept these facts as proof
of the distribution of the structures, because stratigraphy has advanced since
Brnney’s time, and the difficult work of correlating the various coal seams is now much
more complete than it was then, Recent workers have treated the occurrence of the
calcareous bullions in the coal and the marine shells in the roof as typical of a single
horizon, and have, therefore, correlated all the seams in which they occur in both
Lancashire and Yorkshire as forming one definite geological horizon. The work of correlating the large number of small coal seams which appear in the
Lower Coal Measures of northern England is a very difficult one, and is not yet
completed, while the confusion is still considerably increased by the very numerous
local names, some of which are used in different senses in the different localities. The most concise recent account of the coal seams of this age is given by Bouton (98),
who tabulates the various beds and collects the local names of each.
