top layer. The blue (sublayer) layer is more transparent at the used OCT wavelength and probably
thicker samples could be tackled if this one was present as an over layer. By contrast, micro-
SORS provided deeper visibility within the red layer—the detection limit has not been reached
up to the maximum red layer thickness of 120 um analysed. It should be noted that micro-SORS
requires a priori calibration on a samples set made of the same or similar physical and chemical
constituency. On the contrary, OCT may provide the real thickness values, without any calibration
sample set, as long as the index of refraction of the layer can be determined.

The above results point at the beneficial application areas of micro-SORS. Where applicable,
OCT provides a faster, simpler non-invasive method. Micro-SORS can, however, become relevant
in situations where OCT is not applicable. For example, where real-layer thickness exceeds the
maximum accessible depth of OCT. The higher accessible depth of micro-SORS is facilitated
by the fact that the method relies on the diffuse component of light and can, in principle,
therefore, achieve large penetration depths in turbid samples as demonstrated, for example,
in this study. By contrast, OCT by its nature relies on direct imaging within the sample and
