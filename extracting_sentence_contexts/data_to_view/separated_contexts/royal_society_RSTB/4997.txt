The usual cytological fixatives were used. Considerable difficulty was experienced
with certain species, and many collections unfortunately were not useful for the
purpose of this investigation. This was due to the fact that, while anthers in certain
stages appeared to have undergone the various processes of preparation with good
results, others with identical treatment, particularly with the pollen mother cells in
later stages from diakinesis in the heterotype division onwards, were unsatisfactory ;
the chromatin was often clumped and the nuclear contents stained in a hard uniform
manner in which all detail was obscured. Examination showed that the mother cell
wall is usually considerably thickened at these stages. Possibly this hampers the
penetration of the fixative with the result that the fixation is poor.
