other portion, which had not been saturated with lime, by being
treated with more nitric acid, lost all its bitterness, and oxalic
acid was formed, In this experiment it appears, that by some

action of nitrous acid on. sugar, a bitter $ubstance and malic
acid were produced together ; that by the farther action of
nitrous acid, the bitter substance disappeared, and acid ap-
peared in its stead. .

The foregoing conjectures correspond also with the fact,
that by the action of certain substances on each other, the
bitter principle is evolved at the same time with those acids
which I suppose to have been produced from that compound
basis : and the appearance of both at the same time may be
accounted for by admitting that the conversion was not
complete. Thus, if alcohol be distilled with nitrous acid, a
liquor is produced which has a sweet taste. If this liquor be
re-distilled with another portion of acid, a bitter liquor comes
over. And if this bitter liquor be distilled a third time with
a fresh portion of nitrous acid, crystals of oxalic acid make
their appearance in the residuum. This series of changes
bears a striking resemblance to that produced by the action
