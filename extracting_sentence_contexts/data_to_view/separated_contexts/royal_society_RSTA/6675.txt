It remains to determine the parameter a of equation (5-14).
@ C,, E, and PV are measurable, the latter from the oscillograph record as described later in
© this report; the remaining quantity which enters into «, the product C; D, is calculated from
= Kirchhoff’s expression for the capacity C, of a parallel-plate condenser consisting of one
% insulated and one earthed circular disk, each of radius a, thickness d, placed parallel to
each other at distance D apart (see, for example, Kohlrausch 1930, p. 658). This expression

g can be written in the form
S C, = @(1+¢)/3-6D (mF), (5-17)

D
5 Thus C,D = a2(1+¢)/3-6  (C, in yuk, D in cm.). (5-17)
4 Ifa = 0:5in. = 1-27cm., D= 0-0162in. = 0-0411 cm. and d = 0-25in. = 0-635 cm., then
$=0-125; if a—0-25 in. —0-635cm., D=0-0124 in. =0-0316cm., d=0-125 in. =0-317;cm.,
then g=0-178,. Considering equation (5-172), the value of a is easily determined to a high degree of
} accuracy. ¢ is only a correction term and the value of the factor (14-4) is insensitive to small
variations in the values of D and d; in fact, when evaluating ¢ from equation (5-18) and C, D
from equation (5-17), it is found that sufficient accuracy for most purposes is obtained if
Dis determined approximately by feeler gauges, etc., and if dis taken as the thickness of the
insulated plate of the condenser unit.
