It may be
mentioned that the membrane of the megaspore in this species shows an irregularly
reticulated structure. Fig. 18, representing the third section from below (the
intermediate one not being figured), is of greater interest. The marked narrowing
of the ‘‘ seed” towards the proximal end is due to the fact that the plane of section
here passes through the micropylar region. The contracted megaspore is still visible ;
the sporangium is free from the sporophyll; between the two at the distal end, and
seated in a depression of the sporophyll-tissue, is a delicate crescent-shaped body (/g),
which from its position, form, and structure is evidently the ligule. It is shown,
more highly magnified, in fig.
