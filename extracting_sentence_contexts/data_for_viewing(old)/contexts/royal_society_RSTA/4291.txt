The key point for this paper is the precise form of the energy wells of W. These are pairs (F,m) .

consisting of a 3 x 3 deformation gradient F and corresponding magnetization m that minimize

the local free-energy density W. In the case that the martensite is ferromagnetic and 6 < 69, these

have the following general form [23]:

(RU, +Rmj), (RUz,+Rmp),...,(RU;,+Rm,), Râ‚¬SO(3). (2.3)

Note for later use the rotational invariance, and the important fact that the same rotation
matrix appears in front of U; and m;. The symmetric, positive-definite tensors Uj,...,Uy, called
transformation stretch tensors, define the variants of martensite. All of the wells can be obtained
from the first one by using the point group P = {Q;,...,Q,,} of undistorted austenite:

{(U1,my),..., (Un, m)} = (Q;U1 QF, Q;m1):i= 1,..., m1). (2.4)

Generally, n < m because there can be degeneracy, as in the tetragonal case below. There can also
bea further degeneracy (consistent with (2.4)) in which several magnetizations are paired with the
same stretch tensor. (A practical example occurs in the tetragonal phase of Fe7Pd3 [26].) We will
assume that W =0 on the states given in (2.3) and is positive elsewhere, for 6 < 6.

At the transformation temperature, 0 = 0p, there are one or more additional wells associated
