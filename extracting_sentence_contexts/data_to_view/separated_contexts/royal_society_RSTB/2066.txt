JI should be much more inclined to believe
that the stomata open in darkness owing to the epidermic cells being less resistant, and
losing their turgor before the guard cells do so. This explanation is mentioned by
Lerrees only to be set aside, but it agrees well with his own general conclusions, and
with his observations on the vitality of the guard cells ; it also fits in with my results
in Section 3. The chief interest of the fact is in relation with the mechanism of the stoma, which
is dealt with in a later section (ยง 20).
* In some experiments already quoted Sparmannia could not be shut by darkness.
