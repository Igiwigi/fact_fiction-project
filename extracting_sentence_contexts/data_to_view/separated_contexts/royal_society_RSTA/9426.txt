The specifications described in the next section were carried out independently of
any previous work, and as they offer several distinct advantages with regard to the
construction of a practical standard of anemometry, it has been thought by the writer
worth while to describe them in some detail. The special type of instrument developed
may be called a linear anemometer consisting only of a single wire, and is especially
suited for the study of turbulent flow and the analysis of sharp gradients of velocity
such as are to be found in the neighbourhood of obstacles in streams, in jets, &c. The
advantage to be derived from the use of a single wire lies in the fact that it is
possible to measure with considerable accuracy the velocity in the neighbourhood of
the wire with no appreciable disturbance of the flow at a distance of a few diameters
away. This statement is easily verified from the classical solution of the flow of a
stream past a cylindrical obstacle. In the case of a circular cylinder of radius @ in a
stream of a perfect fluid of undisturbed velocity V, the velocity potential of the
point (7, 0) is given by Â¢ = V (7+a*/r) cos 6, @ being measured from the down-
stream direction of the stream.
