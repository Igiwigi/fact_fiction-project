generally-accepted expression “neugliederung,” or new segmentation. O. HErtwic
(‘Lehrbuch der Entwicklungsgeschichte der Menschen und der Wirbelthiere,’ Jena,
1888, p. 473) pointed out that the expression is not correct, because, as long as the
axial column is still in the membranous stage, there is no segmentation in it, and
it is only when cartilage makes its appearance that “ gliederung” makes its ‘appear-
ance. This argumentation does not quite meet the point.

However, it is misspent energy to seek the solution of the mystery of resegmenta-
tion in birds and reptiles. The necessity of overlapping of contractile and passive
segments has been met with before any Amniota came into existence, even long
before there was anything like a segmented vertebral column; it is ready in
Dipnoi and Holocephali, which have no segmented centra in their axial skeleton,
ready in Cyclostomes even before they show any cartilaginous arches. In fact, the

* The protovertebre cease to exist as such after they haye given off the skeletogenous material,
henceforth there exist only myotomes and sklerotomes. It is, therefore, confusing to speak of the
interprotoyertebral position of the myocommata,

overlap began with the earliest Vertebrate, which did not progress by peristaltic
motion.

The overlap, the alternation to the extent of one-half, dates back to the stage
