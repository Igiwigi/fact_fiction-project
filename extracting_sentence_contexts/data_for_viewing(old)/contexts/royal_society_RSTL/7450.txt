ſue from which it appeared that the mercurial column sank during the first third
& inspiration, rose during the second two thirds, continued to rise during the beginning
& expiration, and again fell during the remainder. Of these facts he gives the following
tQeoretical explanation :—* 'The negative inspiration-pressure not only sucks air into the
kings, but blood towards the heart. The greater impletion of the heart enables it to
Fopel more blood into the arteries, and increases its frequency, while its contraction as
E@mpared with its relaxation is prolonged. Expiration produces an opposite result ; for
# facilitates the emptying of the lungs of blood, and adds to the systemic pressure. But,
3Basmuch as the heart becomes less and less full during expiration, the increase of pressure
8 limited to the commencement of the expiratory act, a 8smaller quantity of blood being
Fjected into the arteries. At the same time the duration of the contraction diminishes,
Mhile that of relaxation increases” (p. 353). Here the author appears to attach much
more importance to the direct influence of expiration than the facts warrant.

EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES.

In each figure the upper tracing is that produced by the lever connected with the
Dynamometer, and expresses the yariations of arterial pressure ; the lower by the lever
connected with the caoutchouc bag, and expresses the moyements of air in and out of
the chest.

In the arterial tracing three-tenths of an inch of vertical measurement correspond to
