bombarded by atoms we must expect the adsorbed atoms to be distributed in a
uniform phase over the emitting surface. The fact that in these experiments only
one side of the filament is being bombarded and that the peak current is one half
that obtained in the non-equilibrium experiments when both faces of the filament are
covered with adsorbed atoms shows quite definitely that in the non-equilibrium
experiments also the adsorbed layer does not split up into two phases as it does with
caesium on tungsten. In the results published by Taytor and Lanemurr, the
maximum positive ion current from a tungsten filament at a certain temperature
when the whole of the emitting surface is bombarded continuously by caesium atoms
is four times that observed when caesium is deposited and the filament is subsequently
heated to the same temperature.

The fact that the emission curves, fig. 4, all rise to the same peak value shows that the
thickness of the oxide is uniform to a high degree of accuracy, for otherwise we should
expect that as the emission proceeded, different elements of the surface, covering
different thicknesses of oxide, would reach the value of the surface concentration
corresponding to the maximum rate of positive ion emission per sq cm at different
times. In these circumstances, which actually arise if the oxidation is not carried
out in appropriate conditions, the peak in the positive ion current is found to be lower
and more diffuse the larger the number of atoms deposited on the filament. Since
the peak current in these experiments attains a constant value in experiments with
widely different numbers of deposited atoms we may assume that the concentration
of adsorbed atoms remains accurately uniform over the whole of the emitting surface
throughout the emission. At a given temperature a given positive ion current thus
corresponds to a given concentration of adsorbed atoms on the emitting surface.
