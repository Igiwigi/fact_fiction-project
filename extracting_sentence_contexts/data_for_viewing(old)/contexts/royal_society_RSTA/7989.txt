peroxides or substances which give rise to ignition might be present in too small
quantities to observe. The reasons against this interpretation are that only knocking
fuels give rise to the peroxides, and only just prior to “ knock,” while the quantities
were in accordance with the observation of the effect of knock-inducing peroxides.
Further work is in hand to attempt to decide this difficult point.

It appears that the general characteristics of reaction of a straight chain paraffin
are fairly similar.t{ First a wall reaction sets in, measureable at quite low temper-
atures, 100° to 150° C, but apparently not extending into the gas appreciably, till
suddenly between 200° and 300° C, at a certain “ reacting temperature,” reaction
becomes rapid, extends by chains into the gas, and gives rise mainly to condensable
products such as aldehydes which provide CO in their subsequent combustion and
also gives rise to emission of light—in fact, cool flames become visible at this stage.
As the temperature rises, this stage is succeeded by slower reactions, and less
luminosity, until at considerably higher temperatures ignition finally takes place.

The reaction temperature stage is without doubt the same stage as leads to the
low-temperature ignition range of TowNEnD, and to the cool flame region noted by
many investigators. At the higher pressures of TowNEND’s experiments the chains
are either protected from the chain-breaking influence of the walls so that reaction
heat cannot be dissipated and ignition occurs, or products are formed which
eventually disrupt and lead to a branched chain type of explosion.

* The influence of lead tetraethyl on the ignition of aldehydes and the effect on the destruction
of the knock effect of acetyl peroxide are in support of the view that the lower ignition range is
