In like manner, if we apply this mode of conversion to the more general form

Du+2QDu+(@+Q—&—==))u=0,

of which the solution expressed symbolically is
una" 4(D?— 2) {x (D?—&@)-'0},

the definite integral ought to be

1 1
u=kinsaſ* (21) nde+Ramntensſ" (2—1)-"i="ds,

and this is in fact the solution.

The limits must be determined by verifying the equation and assigning them
accordingly; the verification at the same time establishing in the particular cases
the correctness of the results arrived at by the substitution. Thus, if we take the
general form

*2(D)u+4(D)u=0,
and its symbolical solution
u={0(D)}" {#2 2-1-x00},
