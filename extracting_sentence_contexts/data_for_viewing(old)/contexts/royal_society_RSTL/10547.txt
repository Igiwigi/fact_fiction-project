Tt has three times been firs on the plot with mixed mineral manure and the larger
amount of nitrate, and once on the plot with the same amount of nitrate without
minerals. It was second on one of the high ammonia and mineral plots in 1862, and
in the same year it was third on four other ammonia plots. In 1867 it was second
only on the dung plot and on one of the nitrate plots. Since that date it has been
neither first, second, nor third on any of the ammonia plots. In 1872 it was gecond
on two of the nitrate plots, but in the last year of separation ib was firs on only
oneâ€”a nitrate plot, and not second nor third on any.

The number of plots on which ib contributed 5 per cent. and upwards of the
produce was 14 in 1862, only eight in 1867, and was reduced to three in 1872, and to
two in 1877. The plots on which it maintained this degree of prominence were all
nitrate plots. Tn fact, although at first extremely prominent on many plots it
strikingly declined wherever ammonia was applied, and almosb as strikingly retained
its position on the plot with the mineral manure and the larger amount of nitrate of
soda (14); yielding on it 22:48 per cent. of the total produce in 1862, 32*93 in 1867,
2476 in 1872, and 21:59, in 1877; whilst in 1874 it was estimated to form about
one-half of the total herbage of the plot.
