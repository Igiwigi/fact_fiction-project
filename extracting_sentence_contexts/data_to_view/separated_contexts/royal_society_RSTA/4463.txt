Although this
aspect becomes more evident for B23, it can also be detected in the case of Bz. This corresponds
to the reported behaviour in other previous studies and the overall known resistance to remove a
fluid from dense packing and media with small porosity. The larger differences between Bz and
By3 when the value of s increases is explained by the fact that the amount of oil O3 is less sensitive
to variations in the value of s than O2 and Ap. It is important to note that the two different measures can guide expected results for other
packing arrangements that can be built in similar way. If the whole channel is filled with discs,
one should expect the value of Bz as a good approximation.
