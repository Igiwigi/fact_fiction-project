(1) Sulphuric Acid. From Tuomsen’s values of Q for N = I,N = 2 and N = 5 respectively, the equation
is

Q = 4666 log, N—196 N+6595,

DILUTION OF CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS. 345

The accuracy with which this can be applied is comparable with that of THomsen’s
formula—in fact the accuracy is greater if the most dilute solution is ignored. Concentration } By calculation. molecules of water to | Results by experiment.
