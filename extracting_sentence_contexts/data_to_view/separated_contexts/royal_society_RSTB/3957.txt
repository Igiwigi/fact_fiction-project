When men or animals are rapidly subjected to atmospheres deficient in oxygen,
or at low pressures, marked hyperpnoea is produced, even during rest. The absence
of any marked hyperpneea during rest on high mountains, &c., might, perhaps, suggest
that some factor other than want of oxygen is producing the symptoms. It was shown,
however, by Hanpane and Povnront that the marked hyperpncea of oxygen want
is only temporary, and is due to the fact that want of oxygen aids carbon dioxide in
exciting the respiratory centre, The effect of this is that for a short time the proportion
of carbon dioxide already present in the blood and tissues is more than sufficient to excite
the centre normally. When the excess has been got rid of by a temporary hyperpncea
the breathing again becomes quiet ; and if the transition to want of oxygen is gradual
the temporary marked hyperpneea is not noticed. Want of oxygen, without the aid
of carbon dioxide, does not excite the respiratory centre at all; for YANDELL HENDERSON
has shown that after vigorous and prolonged artificial respiration, or hyperpnoea
produced by excessive stimulation of afferent nerves, sufficient to remove most of the
carbon dioxide from the blood and tissues, animals die from want of oxygen without
drawing a single breath.{
