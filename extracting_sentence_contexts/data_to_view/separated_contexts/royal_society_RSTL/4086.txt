The downward curve of the upper edge in expiration, G!, becomes in G?,
inspiration, a slightly upward curve; G' presents a flat surface, G? a thin edge. In
H', expiration, there is a slight curve on the inner surface ; in H?, inspiration, the
curve is deepened; and the flat surface of the rib is presented instead of the edge, as
in HP. In fact that curve that looked upward in expiration G! looks inward in inspi-
ration H?, and the lateral surface in G?, expiration, becomes in H?, inspiration, the
superior surface.

41. On inspiration. The oblique internal surface of the superior ribs is more nearly
horizontal.
