run in the pipeline [78]. Where the Bayesian inference is itself carried out within the data pipeline,
the provenance information will itself chain back to incorporate both the stochastic model and the
primary datasets.

7. Discussion

During the COVID-19 pandemic, media outlets have channelled highly charged and politically
polarized arguments about the trustworthiness of scientific advice for government policy and also
of the advisors themselves, as well as debating the extent to which governments are, in any event,
following such advice. While some such controversies are inevitable, as a scientific community
endeavouring to provide the best advice we can to policymakers, we are at a disadvantage if the
detail of our results is hidden and if the evidence chain that connects our advice to the data and
models that underpin it is not just unavailable to the public, but in fact largely non-existent. This
situation has arisen although standards have been available for many years, promoting openness
and reuse of data and metadata, in particular through the FAIR principles for scientific data
management [12].

The FAIR Data Pipeline was SCRCâ€™s response to this aspect of pandemic response. Querying
epidemiologists involved in both human and animal disease modelling, we could identify no
tools being used that satisfied either FAIR principles or which publicly presented the provenance
