and a starting time of 13-9-+ 1-6sec. The velocity agrees with that of P,, which
suggests that the wave may travel for most ofits time in the ultrabasic layer, being refracted
to and reflected back from the free surface at one point in its path. The relation between the
starting times is confirmed more accurately by the fact that the centroid ofthe P, observations
has a residual of 6-95 + 0-45 sec. on P, which agrees closely with the P, intercept of 737+
0Â°13sec. If the equation of P, is deduced entirely from that of P,, the standard deviation for
one observation becomes 0-8 sec., and the number of successes in the whole line is 7.
