measly pork taken from at least fifty different pigs. In one class of these specimens i
found scarcely any but adult Cysticerci, after examining, perhaps, fifty different pieces; I
might, however, find one or two of the immature ones, but these were always in the last
Stage of the vermicular form. In others, a second class, I could find only the earliest
Stages of the Cysticerci, and none of the perfectly-formed ones. And in the third class

of specimens, I found them in every possible stage of development, even in the same
field of the microscope. I think the last class of specimens was the largest.

Now the inference I deduce from these facts is, first, that the animals from which
the first set of specimens were taken had some time prior to their being slaughtered been
placed under circumstances favourable for the production of Cysticerci (most probably
the food had contained the germs of these animalcules), but had for a certain period
been withdrawn from them, s0 that all the younger animalcules—those constituting the
vermicular stage—had been, as it were, used up to produce the adult ones; secondly, that
those from which the second set had been taken had only been recently placed under
such circumstances, and had remained 80 circumstanced up to the time that they had
been slaughtered; and thirdly, that those from which the third set of specimens had been
taken, had, both some time previously, and immediately before they were slaughtered,
been placed under circumstances favourable for the production and development of Cys-
ticerci. Now, as to the determination and discovery of what these favourable circum-
stances are, it would be necessary that the history of infected animals, giving similar
