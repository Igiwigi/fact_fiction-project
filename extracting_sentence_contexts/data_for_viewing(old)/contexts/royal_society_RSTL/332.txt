My first experiment was not altogether sSuccessful ; for the
offspring of five. pods- (the whole which-escaped the birds),re-
ceived their colour from the coloured male. . There was, how-
ever, a strong resemblance-to the other male, in the growth and
character of more-than-one of the plants; -and the seeds of se-
veral, in the-autumn, very closely-resembled it in every thing
but colour. In-this experiment, 1 used the farina of a white
pea, which possessed the remarkable property of shrivelling ex-
cessively when ripe; and, in the second year, 1 obtained white
seeds, from the gray ones above mentioned, perfectly similar to
it. I am strongly disposed to believe, that the seeds were here
of common parentage; but-I do not conceive myself to be. in
possession of facts sufficient-to enable? me to-speak with decision
on this question.

If, however, the' female afford the first tau atom,-and
the farina act-only as'a stimulus, it appears to'me by no-means
impossible, that the explosion of two vesicles of farina, at the
same moment, (taken from different-plants,) may afford seeds
(as I have supposed) of common parentage; and, as I am un-
able to discover any source/ of inaccuracy in this NE
I must believe this to have happened.
