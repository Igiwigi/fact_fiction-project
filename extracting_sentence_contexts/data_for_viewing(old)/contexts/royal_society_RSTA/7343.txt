THE FORMATION OF THE WIDMANSTATTEN STRUCTURE

It is outside the scope of the present paper to discuss in detail the formation of the
Widmanstatten structure of meteorites. It is relevant, however, to consider how far the
lattice mechanism derived from the observed orientation relationships serves to explain
the Widmanstatten structure.

The fact that Widmanstatten figures can be observed at all arises from the growth of
kamacite in the form of plates which in meteorites are surrounded by taenite. In the
report of the original investigation it was remarked that the plate-like nature of kamacite
probably owed its origin to the fact that a {110}-plane of this crystal was “ready-made”
as a {111}-plane of the y-lattice and the shearing movements involved in the y-« trans-
formation were indicated. Such shearing movements of the (111)-planes over one
another in a [112]-direction and their expansion in a [110]-direction, in accordance
with the Nishiyama mechanism, will produce a condition of disturbance at the edges of
the incipient crystal conducive to rapid growth outwards in the (111)-plane. Plate-like
crystals will therefore be produced.

Such a theory can explain in some considerable degree the imperfect Widmanstatten
structures of artificial nickel-irons, but it is doubtful if it can wholly account for the
extraordinarily good Widmanstatten figures in many meteorites, and it certainly does
not explain the occurrence of taenite or the plessitic fields.
