of a situation one is interested in. Thus let {P;} and {Q;} be two PDIs for the same system. If and
only if they are compatible,

P)Qk =QkP; for all j and k, (3.4)

can there be a common refinement, a PDI consisting of all the non-zero P;Q;; otherwise they are
incompatible and cannot be combined. The CH approach resolves (or evades or tames) the standard
quantum paradoxes by means of the single framework rule, which prohibits as meaningless those
arguments which reach some conclusion by (often implicitly) combining properties belonging to
incompatible PDIs or frameworks; the latter term can include PDIs involving events at different
times.

An immediate application to the present discussion arises from the fact that the {Mj}, the
possible measurement outcomes, form a PDI. But there is another PDI with just two projectors,
[W] and I, — [W], with [¥] = |W) (| the weird ‘cat’ property introduced above, and I,, the identity
on the apparatus Hilbert space Hm. This PDI, {[¥], Im — [W]}, is incompatible with the {Mj} PDI
when, as we are assuming, two or more of the rj are non-zero. Both PDIs are valid quantum
descriptions, but they cannot be combined. One cannot say, at least while being careful in the use
of language, that [Y] corresponds to the pointer being simultaneously in several locations, since
talk of [W] renders talk of pointer positions represented by the M; meaningless.” In summary, the
CH approach resolves the first measurement problem, a Schrédinger cat state |W) of the output,
by employing a framework or PDI {M;} as the sample space to which |W) assigns probabilities

2In the quantum logic of Birkhoff & von Neumann [10], the combination of [¥] and some M; is meaningful, but false. This,
alas, is not very helpful; see the discussion in $4.6 of [11].
