It appears from the slightest examination of the preceding
Table, that all the crystals with one, 7wo, or three axes, range
themselves under their particular primitive forms, and that
the only exceptions to this general fact, are Idocrase and Apo-
phyllite, which we have no doubt will be found to have pri-
mitive forms, different from those assigned to them by Havy.
All the crystals with one axis have for their primitive forms
a hexaedral prism, a rhomboid with an obtuse summit, and
an octohedron in which the pyramids have a square base.
All the crystals with three axes, have the cube, the regular
octohedron, and the rhomboidal dodecahedron for their pri-
mitive forms ; and all the crystals with two axes, crystallize
in the various other forms given in the Table.

Hence we are furnished with the means of deducing the
number of axes in crystals from their primitive form, and
