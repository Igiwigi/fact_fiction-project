so that the quasi-periodic motion of the infinite periodic structural system is defined once the
amplitudes defining the motion of the Oth cell are given. In particular, the application of the
Bloch-Floquet condition to the boundary conditions (3.15), (3.16) and (3.18) leads to the following

linear system in the 12 amplitudes of the axial motion in the Oth cell, ut (=A,B, K=L,C,Rand

j=1,2), to be solved for given values of the two transverse amplitudes vol and. vol both
corresponding, respectively, to modes n, and ng,
