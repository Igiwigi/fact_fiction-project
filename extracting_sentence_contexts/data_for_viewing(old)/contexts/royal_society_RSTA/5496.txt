around 7.5 tonnes per person [34]), although there are still uncertainties as to the
extent to which and the speed with which global emissions must fall. But to bring
down global emissions by 2050 sufficiently to avoid dangerous climate change, it
needs a global average of around 2 tonnes of COze per person [35]. There are
also other issues that need to be resolved in setting this fair share level—for
instance in setting it, is consideration given to the maintenance or expansion of
carbon sinks (so do people in nations where carbon sinks can be expanded get
1igher allowances [36])? Also do people who have more carbon-intensive needs
for instance much larger space heating needs during the year—get higher annual
allowances [36]?

However, highlighting the fact that it is individuals’ consumption patterns and

ifestyles that are the real drivers of most GHG emissions means that it is possible
o set a fair share level to which those above this level must contract and those
elow this level are allowed to increase to this level (the concept of contraction
and convergence) [37]. This highlights how avoiding dangerous climate change
depends on the personal responsibility of consumers. It highlights the large draw
of wealthy people’s lifestyles on fossil fuel reserves and on the world’s forests (as
fossil fuel consumption and deforestation are such important contributors to GHG
emissions). It also indirectly brings in the use of some mineral resources in that the
GHG emission accounts for any individual would include the goods they purchase
and thus the fossil fuels used in the mining, refining and use of the resources in
manufacturing these goods and transporting, promoting and selling them.
