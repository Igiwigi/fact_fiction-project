Might not the spherical aberration of lenses be diminished, and eyen corrected, by
giving them a variable density from their vertex? I have three object glasses of this
kind, two erystallized and one uncrystallized, and ground carefully upon. the same
tool; but I have not yet been able to examine their optical properties,

The radiant heat would find a quicker passage through the
transparent screen, and therefore, the difference of effect was
not due to the transmitted heat, but to the heat radiating
from the anterior surface.
