by 6 mm. Very near to it
is a smaller stem, which may have branched from it, but there is no evidence of this
in the sections. In fact, though so many specimens are in our hands, we have none
which shows evidence of branching, though in one case there is a longitudinal section
of a twig nearly 3 cm. long, and it should certainly have shown it, therefore, had
branching been at all frequent. In one slide there is a half-cirele of bundles, in what
might be a leaf base, or might be a branch.
