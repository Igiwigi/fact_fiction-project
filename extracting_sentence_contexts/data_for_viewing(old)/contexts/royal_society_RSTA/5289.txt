problem that arises in the modelling of speculative
One contribution of 13 to a Theme Issue bubbles. The solution of the model is the speculative
‘Partial differential equation models in the component in the price of an asset. In the framework
of viscosity solutions, we show the existence and
uniqueness of the solution. We also show that the
solution is convex in space, and establish several
monotonicity properties of the solution and of the free

socio-economic sciences.

Subject Areas: boundary with respect to parameters of the problem.
applied mathematics, mathematical To study the free boundary, we use, in particular, the
modelling, differential equations fact that the odd part of the solution solves a more

standard obstacle problem. We show that the free
boundary is C® and describe the asymptotics of the
free boundary as c, the cost of transacting the asset,
goes to Zero.

problem, asset—price bubble, finitely lived
financial asset, heterogeneous beliefs
