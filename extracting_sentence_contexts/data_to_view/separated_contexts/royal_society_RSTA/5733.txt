]. Introduction

Ever since the appearance of the theorems about the existence of space-time singularities in
the sense of geodesic incompleteness of generic solutions in general relativity and cosmology
[1,2], and the first indications that the general solution cannot have a singularity of a power-
law character [3], the true nature of generic inhomogeneous solutions of the full Einstein
equations towards the cosmological singularity has been a formidable challenge. In fact, the
initial duality between the proved global geodesic incompleteness and the expected possibility of
local divergences in geometric and physical invariants, has been a major part of the cosmological
singularity problem ever since. It is still an ill-understood problem, but one that has stimulated a
lot of research. For the cosmological singularity problem many conjectures have been formulated.
