which exhibits memory effects (see explanations in Jou & Galenko [20] and references therein).
Equation (4.6) is in fact a generalized Langevin equation with coloured noise [14]. As said in
the third paragraph of the present introductory section, equations of this kind may arise from
several effects, but here we have considered that the dominant effect is the lack of internal local
equilibrium.

In the particular case of an exponential memory kernel [16,20],

(with the relaxation time t, of ), we may rewrite equation (4.6) together with equation (4.9) as
