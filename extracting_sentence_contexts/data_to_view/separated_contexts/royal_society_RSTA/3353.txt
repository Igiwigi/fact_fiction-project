More about the major evolutionary transitions can be found in [28] and
references therein. The fact that extant life descended from a single ancestor is suggested by the properties shared
by all organisms on the Earth, and the relatedness identified in the ribosomal tree. In fact, all
life is based on the same nucleic acids, which provide a medium to store genetic information. The genetic code is almost the same across the three domains. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is
the universal currency for chemical energy and is produced by an enzyme which is universally
distributed: the ATP synthase.
