ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF ECHINODERMATA. 845

te., they would repeatedly choose the same feet-rows wherewith to execute their
righting movements. In these individual specimens, therefore, the probability is that
the feet-rows thus selected were selected because of some slight accidental prepotency
or superiority over the others ; and thus the explanation in all cases doubtless is that,
although the physiological conditions are pretty nicely balanced, they are not 0 nicely
balanced as to leave positively nothing to determine which rows of feet shall be used.

Another question of still more interest is that as to the prompting cause of all these
laborious movements, Is it that the animal has some dim consciousness of discomfort,
owing to a disturbance of a nascent sense of gravity? Or is the whole series of move-
ments purely mechanical, and determined only by the fact that the feet in the feet-
rows are all arranged serially, and therefore when feet A, B, and C have established a
firm hold and thereby tilted the globe over a certain distance, opportunity is afforded
for D, E, and F to establish a hold, and 0 on ? This question had better, for the
present, be deferred.

(B.) Spines.—(C.) Lantern.—Tt is, of course, well known that the spines of the
£Echinus are used in locomotion ; but hitherto their action does not seem to have been
carefully observed, and we are not aware that the part played by the lantern has ever
been observed at all. Observations on these points may best be made by taking the
animal ont of the water, and placing it upon a table ; it will then soon begin to walk
