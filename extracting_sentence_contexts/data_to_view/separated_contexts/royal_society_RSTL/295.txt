com-
posed as follows:
Carbonic acid, - -..,16,70

Peroxide of copper 60,7
Peroxide of jron - 19.50 Silica - - 2.10
Loss ‚Äù - 9.95

100.00 The silica was obviously accidental, and derived from the
quartz crystals; so that the ore, in fact, consists of carbonic
acid, peroxide of copper, and red oxide of iron. In the differ-
ent analyses, I have found the copper to vary a little, The
least quantity I obtained was 48.6, the greatest 51 grains. The red oxide of iron and siliceous matter varied also some-
what.
