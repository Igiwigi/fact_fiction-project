Uniform
magnetization is in general possible only for bodies bounded by surfaces of the second degree. Only in that case can a demagnetization factor be uniquely defined, and the demagnetization
relations be given ina relatively simple form which is independent of the magnetic character-
istics of the material. Any apparent artificiality is mitigated by the fact that the general
ellipsoidal form covers, as an approximation, almost the whole variety of possible shapes for
the physical particles, or segregates, which are likely to be of physical interest. Detailed calculations have been made for particles in the form of spheroids, prolate and
oblate. The range of particle shapes covered in this way is from a plate or disk at one extreme
to a thin rod or needle at the other.
