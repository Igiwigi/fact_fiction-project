since there are o(2i ) frequencies kz in each dyadic shell and the largest term in the sum of order
21-7 by (4.5).

The uniform bound (3.9) follows from the fact that the symbol of e e , is uniformly
bounded in « and ¢ in L®. Lastly, the convergence of 6* to 09, which is the unique solution of
the transport equation with data 6 is a direct consequence of the strong continuity of the heat
semigroup in LP 4 BS a

We turn to showing that anomalous dissipation holds for 6*.

Theorem 4.3. In the hypotheses of lemma 4.2, for each t > 0, there exists a constant y > 0 such that
