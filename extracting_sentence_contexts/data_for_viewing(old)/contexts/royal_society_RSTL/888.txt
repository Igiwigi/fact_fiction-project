expansion, dependent on a certain relative proportion of the dif-
ferent metals.

The experiments on the comparative wear of gold, which are
described in the last section, were attended with considerable
difficulties; for this reason, the conclusions have been founded
only upon such facts as were uniformly the same under every
circumstance. These general conclusions have been already
fully stated ; but we may again observe, that gold of moderate
ductility is (all things being considered) the best adapted to the
purpose of coin, and that the real wear of such coin is, in all
probability, very slowly effected; s0 that a long period of time
must elapse, before any considerable diminution in weight can
be perceived.

The experiments contained in these three sections were limited
to standard gold; and, allowing that some curious and instruc-
tive facts have been discovered, still more might have been
expected from an extension of such experiments to gold variously
