GASEOUS COMBUSTION AT HIGH PRESSURES. 313

Another very notable and significant feature was the complete absence of both
acetylene and ethylene from the final products, which, however, always contained con-
siderable quantities of methane, even at the highest pressures. Such facts point to
a sufficient violence in the explosion to shatter completely any unsaturated hydro-
carbon or acetylene, if indeed such were momentarily found in the flame, and afford
also another striking proof of the great stability of methane at the highest explosion
temperatures,
