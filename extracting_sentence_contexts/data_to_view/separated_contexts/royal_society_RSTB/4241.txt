These writers state} that when such a lead is adopted two deflections
are recorded, the first of which indicates basal negativity (an upstroke), and the second
of which indicates apical negativity (a slow downstroke). The two deflections of opposite
sign described by SANDERSON and PAGE have been recorded by many experimenters,
and out of this observation the impression has grown that the excitation wave proceeds
as a simple muscle wave from base to apex of the heart. But recently it has been
ascertained by SamostorrÂ§ and Gorcui| that in certain base-apex leads the second
slow deflection has the same direction as the primary deflection, and Gorcx, who
appears to have been prompted in the first place by this fact, ventured the
hypothesis that the excitation wave travels from base to apex and ultimately returns

to the base. He found confirmation of this view in an inconspicuous movement of

the recorder in a downward direction, at a time corresponding somewhat closely to S
in fig. 1. Briefly, the base-apex curve was said to be triphasic, comprising (1) a base-
negative effect, (2) an apex-negative effect, and (3) a base-negative effect.
