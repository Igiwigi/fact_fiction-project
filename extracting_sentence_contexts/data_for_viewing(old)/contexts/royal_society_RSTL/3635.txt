ment.

The structure of the oyum in Iulus approximates to that of the higher classes, and
is in accordance with the observations of WaGxes, B1scrorr, and of Dr. Marin Barsy,
whose invaluable researches on this subject have 80 recently enriched the Transac-
tions of the Royal Society. The same reasons that induced this last inquirer to ad-
vocate the existence of the membrana vitelli and chorion in the earlier stages of the
oyum of higher animals, have also led me to believe in its existence in these lower

forms, the Myriapoda; an inference entirely in accordance with the facts subse-
quently ascertained respecting the membranes that invest the embryo at the bursting
of the oyum.

Moreover, the few facts detailed in this paper show that the habits of these crea-
tures, although hitherto comparatively neglected, are as interesting to the naturalist
as those of the more extensively investigated divisions of other Articulata.

But it is in the evolution of the embryo that the facts ascertained appear to be of
the greatest interest. In conformity with the views of Scawaxx and SCHLEIDEN, and
of our own accurate observer, Dr. Marmix Barmy, the embryo of Julus in its earlier
stages is found to be composed entirely of a congeries of cells, thus assimilating in
origin the animal to the vegetable creation. But in the higher animals, as is well
