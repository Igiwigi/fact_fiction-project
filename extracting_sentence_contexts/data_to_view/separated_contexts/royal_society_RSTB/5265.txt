The primordia of the posterior zygapophyses (= dorsal-interdorsals) thus do not belong
genetically to the caudal halves of the sclerotomes, but are derivatives of the cranial halves
of the latter. Similarly, a portion of the subganglionic division of the cranial sclerotomite (= inter-
dorsal) partakes in the formation both of the neural arch as well as of the dorso-lateral
portion of the secondary vertebral body. SCHAUINSLAND’S supposition that the neural arches in birds are not products of a
single metamere but belong like the vertebral bodies to two different sclerotomes, which,

he endeavoured to prove by fragmentary embryological evidence, can thus be confirmed
by a continuous series of embryological facts. The principle of resegmentation thus
holds true not only in the case of vertebral bodies but also in the vertebral arches. Observations made on Larus and Struthio prove that the nature of the ‘ subchordale
Spange ” of Frortep is not so elementary as was described by him for the cervical region
of the vertebral column in chick.
