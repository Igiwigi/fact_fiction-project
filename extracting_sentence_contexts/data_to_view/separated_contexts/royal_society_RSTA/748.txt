But no: ‘I'll go and spend
£250 on a new washing machine.’ It doesn’t make a lot of sense to me.’

This sense of frustration about the lifespan and disposability of devices was expressed in two
ways. First, participants felt very negatively about the fact that they had had to purchase a new
appliance earlier than they felt should have been necessary, and second, they were unhappy that
they were replacing older, more reliable, appliances with newer, less reliable ones. To summarize,
participants expressed a range of complex negative emotions (e.g. disappointment, resentment,
frustration and regret) at the performance and durability of goods and the fact that they were
having to invest money in replacing them so quickly.

(iii) Technological and social change

In addition to concerns about the quality of the products, a number of participants expressed
negative emotions at having to purchase new products due to technological change. This was
especially the case when participants felt the purchase was in some way forced upon them. This
feeling was particularly prevalent when it came to ICT equipment.
