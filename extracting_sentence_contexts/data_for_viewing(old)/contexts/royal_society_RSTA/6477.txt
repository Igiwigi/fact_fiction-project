4. Economics

(a) Energy and neoclassical economics

Odum could see the MPP at work in contemporary human societies: structures emerge that collect
and dissipate more fossil fuels to the extent that they are available. Hall writes that Odum ‘felt


that societies or groups that chose not to do this could be more efficient but would be overtaken by
systems that continued to focus on increasing their rate of exploitation of fossil fuels, at least while
fuels were abundant’ [6]. Consequently, when fossil fuels were abundant in the 1960s, Odum
believed that the US should use them first, or at least ‘not take themselves out of the race to use
fossil fuels’, despite the fact that many people at that time, including his own graduate students,
believed that we needed to reduce industrialization to reduce pollution [29].

More and more scientists—starting more than 100 years ago with Ukrainian Physician Serge
Podolinski, the chemist Frederick Soddy and the sociologist Frederick Cottrell—have recognized
that the key to understanding human history and economics is understanding how humans
have used energy. Hall provides a brief description of the role energy played in the creation of
contemporary industrial societies,

‘The principal energy sources in antiquity were all derived directly from the sun: human
and animal muscle power, wood, flowing water, and wind. About 300 years ago, the

industrial revolution began. It brought an exponential increase in the energy available :2
