Such would suppose that lactic acid production
has a secondary effect on the respiratory centre, liberating CO, from its combinations
in the centre, and thus forming increased quantities of CO, in the centre itself which

act as a stimulus. Such a theory would account for the facts up to a certain point. This point seems to me to be the one at which a fresh equilibrium is established in the
body. So long as lactic acid is accumulating in the body it is possible to conceive
of fresh liberation of CO, in the respiratory centre, but at the end of a long slow
grinding climb it is difficult to suppose that such accumulation is taking place.
