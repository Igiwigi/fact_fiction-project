This theorem had been stated but not proved by Wulff in 1901 [17], and had been subjected
to various attempts to provide a formal proof, notably by von Laue in 1943 [18]. BCF note in an
appendix that there was ‘no satisfactory proof of the three-dimensional Wulff theorem’ even then,
but do offer a proof of the two-dimensional case. In fact papers published soon afterwards by
Conyers Herring [19,20] are generally attributed with addressing the three-dimensional problem,
and certainly broaden the range of applications of the theorem. The final part (IV) of BCF addresses the suggestion of Frenkel that a significant thermal
equilibrium concentration of steps on an otherwise flat surface should occur in the same way
as that of kinks on steps, thus ensuring step growth can always occur even on low-index surfaces. Specifically, they address the question of the structure, and particularly the roughness, of a crystal
surface as a cooperative phenomenon.
