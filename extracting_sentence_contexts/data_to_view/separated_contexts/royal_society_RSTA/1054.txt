For more :8
information on the development of ultrafast pulse characterization at X-ray FEL facilities, see :
the recent review paper by Helm et al. [70]. Optical streaking experiments were not originally a
developed with XFEL facilities in mind. In fact, many of the techniques now implemented at to
XFELs were pioneered with high harmonic generation-based, table-top attosecond laser sources. (8
The delay-dependent photoelectron spectrum (or spectrogram) of the photoionized electron aw
wavepacket recorded in a two-colour ionization set-up can be used to reconstruct both the :3
streaking laser temporal profile and the average X-ray pulse temporal profile, with a number :8
of different algorithms [71]. However, experiments at XFEL facilities suffer many hardships that .
are not often encountered in table-top attosecond pulse generation. As mentioned earlier, XFEL

pulses typically lack shot-to-shot reproducibility, and the timing synchronization is on the order of

a few hundred femtoseconds.
