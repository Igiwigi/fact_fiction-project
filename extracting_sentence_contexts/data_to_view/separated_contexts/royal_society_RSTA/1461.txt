A single
grating with a spatial frequency, just below the limit as stated in eqn. 1.2, will at best cause a
homogeneous image. Contradicting equation (1.2), this grating is, by itself, clearly not resolved
and merely its presence is being detected, albeit being even significantly coarser than Abbeâ€™s
limit. Ultimately this contradiction to the resolution prediction stems from the fact that we have
no access to the phase of the light in the detector plane. If the phase of this wave on the detector
plane (and the illumination wave) is resolved, the orientation and pitch of the grating can be
calculated. Interestingly, more complex samples or more complicated coherent illumination or
detection schemes such as ptychography, structured illumination or using holographic/phase-
sensitive detection/wavefront sensors [4], provide multiple mutually interfering waves to the
detector plane, which can enable us to ultimately obtain the wanted phase information with
other waves serving as reference waves and therefore equation (1.2) can also be regarded as
the resolution limit for NAjjy > NAget.
