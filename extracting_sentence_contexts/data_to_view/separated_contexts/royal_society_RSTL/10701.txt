VoLKMANN also takes the s8ame ratio 34g as holding good for
different Mammals. If the ratio found by us for the Dog can be applied directly to Man it will support
the results of Frok's experiments. There is one fact, however, which it s8eems to us makes 8uch an inference
Inadmissible, and that is the difference in pulse-rate between the heart of the Dog and
he heart of Man: the average pulse-rate for Man is about 72 per minute, the

verage pulse-rate for the Dog about 120 per minute. Onght not this to make
A difference in the amount of blood thrown out at each systole ? E Tf the supposition is true that the ventricle in the Dog, and presumably in Man
R180, is distended during each diastole to about its maximum capacity, it would
Sem that variations in pulse-rate should have but little influence upon the quantity
"Df blood ejected at each 8ystole.
