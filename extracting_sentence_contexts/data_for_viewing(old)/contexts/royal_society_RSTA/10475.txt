500 MR. O. W. RICHARDSON ON THE ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY

of course, only about one-hundredth that of an air molecule possessing the same free
path, owing to the great velocity of agitation of the corpuscles. Nevertheless we are
quite justified in assuming that the time during which the corpuscles are moving
freely is great compared with that during which they are colliding. In fact this
assumption follows at once if we are to attach any definite meaning to the ideas of
free paths and collisions.

If, in addition to neglecting the number ot corpuscles which are colliding at any
moment in comparison with those which are not, we assume that the atoms of the
metal and the positive ions oscillate about fixed centres and are subject to forces of
restitution which are functions of their displacements only, we obtain at once, by the
application of the ordinary analysis of the kinetic theory, the distribution of velocity
among the corpuscles. This is found to be the same as that for an equal number of
similarly constituted gas molecules. Thus the number of corpuscles (N,N,N,,) which
have velocity components in three mutually perpendicular directions between w and
u + du, v and v + dv, and w and w + dw respectively are given by
