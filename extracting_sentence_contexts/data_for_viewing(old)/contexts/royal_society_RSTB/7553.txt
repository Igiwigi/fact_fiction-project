according to speed of breakdown would not be the same as the ranking according to
amount of graft-tissue destruction during the 8- to 12-day interval. The difference is
caused chiefly by the three series 3044, 183h and 308h, which showed advanced de-
struction at 8 days (see table 1). If these three series are omitted from the treatment,
thus giving a ranking roughly in the order of amount of destruction, the regression
coefficient for the 8- to 12-day increments in percentage pyronin cells now differs signifi-
cantly from zero (t,;=2-84, P approaching 0-01), the greatest increases in the percentage
being associated with the greatest amount of destruction.

If these three series are also omitted from the 8-day array a significant (P=0-02)
negative relationship between percentage of pyronin cells and speed of breakdown is
obtained (the faster series having the lowest percentage). Here the omission would have
for its justification the fact that these three series are sharply different from all the others
at 8 days in their advanced stage of destruction; also, it seems very probable that they
have already at 8 days undergone the increase in percentage of pyronin cells noted above.

(2) Their concentrations

Introduction. Although the cell counts were primarily designed to give the ratio of
pyronin cells to lymphocytes they also provide a measure of the concentrations of these
cells in the grafts, for the counts were made on equal areas in all grafts and the sections
were cut at 8 4 in every series except 243A and 245h (which were cut at 5“). The measure
is subject to several errors, such as the variation in the thickness of the supposedly 8 «
sections, errors due to variations in degree of pyronin staining, and especially the possi-
bility that the particular areas counted may not have been accurately representative of the
