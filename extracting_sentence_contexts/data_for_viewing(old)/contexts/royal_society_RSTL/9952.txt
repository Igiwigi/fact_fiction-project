A. Polar alterations of excitability tested by the break induction eurrent.

Our first series of experiments were made with the ordinary arrangement of the
coll (an electromotive force of 2 volts and a resistance of 1 ohm for the primary
circuit), and gave the following results :—

1. The effect of the kathode of the break induction current ts greater than that of the

anode,

Our interpretation of this fact is as follows ;—The current consists in an almost

simultaneous make and break, and the stimulus depends on the former alone. With
the kathode the polar region is kathodic, with the anode the peripolar region is
kathodic ; since the excitation proceeds in each case from the kathodic region, and
gince the current density is greater in the polar than in the peripolar region, the effect
of the kathode is greater than that of the anode.

2. The effect of the kathode of the break induction current is increased when that
