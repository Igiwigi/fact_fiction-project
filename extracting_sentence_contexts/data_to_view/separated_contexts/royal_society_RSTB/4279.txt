Of the palates of recent races, the Tasmanian figured by
Kerra (9) is larger than any to which I have had access, although several Australian
and New Britain specimens approach it closely. This Tasmanian example is similar
in the estimation of both areas to the reconstructed Heidelberg palate. A study of the calculations of the palatal areas in the various large specimens
investigated shows very clearly that the disparity in size between the Talgai specimen
and the others is much greater in the area in front of the second molar teeth than in
the total palatal area, This further illustrates the fact that the palate is immature in
the Talgai skull. Indeed it is safe to assume that had the wisdom teeth erupted,
even if comparatively little further development of the jaw had taken place therewith,
the palatal area would have been at least 4000 mm. That the area of the palate
should be so great with diameters not strikingly in excess of many modern palates
is explained by the expanded shape of its anterior portion and the prominence
of the canine teeth.
