but as times have changed in the world, the plants themselves have in all probability
changed also in their reactions to external factors. The genus Platanus, though
occupying south temperate regions, is able to withstand relatively severe conditions.
JAENNICKE|| states that Plane trees in Germany lived through winters which were fatal
to many other trees. Ginkgo is a very adaptable tree in northern climates: it lives
out of doors as far north as Viborg in Finland (lat. 60° N.). Sciadopitys is said by W1son4]
to be perfectly hardy in the Harvard Arboretum. Other Cretaceous genera that are now
confined to the Tropics may well have been represented by species better able to endure
hardships than many of their less robust ancestors.

PLANT-BEARING ROCKS OF WESTERN GREENLAND. 161

The climate of Greenland was probably comparable with that of Southern Europe
to-day : genera that are now characteristic members of tropical floras, the floras which
are in part legacies from the Cretaceous age, were then represented by species less sensitive
than their modern descendants to external factors.* Such climatic changes as seem to be
demanded by Paleeobotanical evidence can be accounted for without calling to our aid
explanations based on purely hypothetical departures from the order of nature. Nothing
