In order completely to define the rate of change of the configuration of the system,
there are two other equations, one of which gives the rate of increase of the 8quare
root of the moon's distance (which I called in a previous paper the equation of tidal
reaction), and the other gives the rate of retardation of the earth's diurnal rotation
(which I called before the equation of tidal friction). For the latter of these we
may however s8ubstitute another equation, in which the time is not involved, and
which gives a relationship between the diurnal rotation and the square root of the
moon's distance. It is in fact the equation of conservation of moment of momentum:
of the moon-earth system, as modified by the s8olar tidal friction. This is the equa-
tion which was extensively used in the paper on © Precession.” Except for the solar tidal friction and for the obliquity of the orbit and equator, this
equation would be rigorously independent of the kind of frictional tides existing in the
earth.
