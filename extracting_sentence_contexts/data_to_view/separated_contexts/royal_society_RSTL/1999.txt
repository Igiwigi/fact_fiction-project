STARK ON THE INFLUENCE OF COLOUR, &e.

patients. Facts have been mentioned which make it next to certain, that
contagious disease may be communicated to a third person through the medium

of one who has been exposed to contagion, but himself not affected*; and

indeed the circumstance of infectious effluyia being capable of being carried

by medical men from one patient to another, I should conceive one of the ;
means by which such diseases are often propagated, in the ill-yentilated and

dirty habitations of the poor exposed to their influence. Even in my own very limited experience I think I have observed some me-
lancholy instances of the effect of black dress in absorbing the hurtful emana-
tions of feyer patients in a public hospital ; and many facts are incidentally
related by medical writers, and referred to other causes, which I should not
hesitate to ascribe chiefly to exposure of this nature. Not to mention indi-
vidual cases, in the sessions held at Oxford in July 1577, © there arose amidst
the people such a damp that almost all were smothered+.” Lord Bacox attri-
butes this effect to the © smell of the gaol, where the prisoners haye been close
and nastily kept,” and mentions it having occurred twice or thrice in his time,
when both the judges that sat upon the trial, and numbers of those who at-
tended the business, or were present, sickened or died.”
