This phenomenon was
first established by EpxoxD BecqQueREL from the following observations. If one-half
of an iodized plate of silyer, or a sensitive photographic paper, be protected from the
action of light, whilst the other half is exposed to a constant source of light for such a
time that no alteration, either perceptible to the eye or capable of being developed by
photographic preparations, is effected on the sensitive surface, the plate possesses the Pro-
perty, when exposed to a uniform but very slight amount of light, to blacken on the
insolated half, whilst the part not previously exposed remains unaffected. If, in the first
Short insolation, every part of the plate was not exposed to the same intensity of light,
the blackening effected by the following uniform exposure corresponds to this intensity,
80 accurately indeed, that a daguerreotype picture commenced by this slight exposure
may be developed by subsequent uniform insolation, almost as perfectly as if each
amount of light represented on the picture, and not a constant amount, had acted for the

whole time upon the plate, The explanation of this fact does not require the assump-
tion of a new class of rays, which cannot commence, but only continue, the photo-chemical
