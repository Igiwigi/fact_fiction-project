t The first point to be decided is this :â€”What is the difference shown by the spectro-
photometer between plant chlorophyll and entero-chlorophyll? The reply is a
considerable difference in the respective curves, but, and here comes the most
interesting fact, if we change plant chlorophyll into the modified pigment, or what is
practically the same thing, into the slightly acid modification, by adding a little acetic
acid and allowing it to stand some hours (about twenty-four), the curve follows closely,
in its maxima and in its minima, expressing of course the maxima and minima of
absorption of light by the solution, the curve of entero-chlorophyll and of Chatopterin. It is necessary to give the acid time to act on the plant chlorophyll, as the curve is at
first not quite the same as that obtained when the action has gone on for some hours. I used an absolute alcohol solution of Nasturtium leaves prepared in the cold.
