One of
them, the large ground finch (G. magnirostris), has a
massive, extremely deep and broad bullfinch-shaped
beak that can be deployed to crush the large and hard
seeds that no other bird on the island can handle. Lastly, there is the large cactus finch (G. conirostris)
that has a more elongated yet still robust beak adapted
for penetrating the firm covers of cactus fruits and
closed cactus flower buds that contain protein- and
sugar-rich parts inside (figure 1). All these species

The most curious fact is the perfect gradation in the
size of the beaks in the different species of Geospiza,
from one as large as that of a hawfinch to that of a

High above the cliffs of the Darwin Bay on Isla Geno-
vésa (Tower Island), one of the Galapagos archipelago
islands in the Pacific Ocean, jumping around the sharp
lava rocks on the ground, perched on the branches of
the yellow geiger (Cordia lutea) and croton (Croton
scouleri) bushes and flying around large yellow flowers
of prickly pear cactuses (Opuntia helleri), are small
black and brown birds. These birds look similar to
each other in plumage and song, yet closer observation
reveals that they all differ from one another in how
their beaks look and work.
