pinnz as would indicate a prehensile action, but I have found reason to suspect the
function to be that of sensorially protecting the soft parts which occupy the ventr
surface of the disk, and of preventing unsuitably large particles from being drawn in
the oral current. For if the ordinary pinnules of any arm be irritated by the contact
a rod, such irritation merely produces a languid wavy motion of the arm thus acted-on
which may extend itself to others if the irritation be repeated or prolonged. But
the rod be made to irritate the long basal pinnules, all the arms (if the animal be
full vigour) immediately close together, with an energy and consentaneousness that a

used for the acquisition of food in a manner altogether dissimilar to ordinary prehension
for recognizing the fact that the alimentary particles must be of small size, he 8
posed that any such, falling on the ambulacral (?) furrows of the arms or pinnz, an
transmitted downwards along those furrows to the mouth wherein they all terminate, by
the mechanical action of the digitate papille which fringe their borders. This doctrine
he appears to have sabsequently abandoned ; since in his last account of this type (Hist
Nat. des Echinodermes, p. 194) he affirms that the transmission of alimentary particles
along the ambulacral (?) furrows is the result of the action of cilia with which ther.
snrface is clothed. Although I have not myself sncceeded in distinguishing cilia on the
surface which forms the floor of these furrows, yet I have distinctly seen such a j y
passage of minute particles along their groove, as I could not account for in any other
mode, and am therefore disposed to believe in their existence. Such a powerful
indraught, moreover, must be produced about the region of the mouth, by the action of
the large cilia which (as T shall hereafter describe) fringe yarious parts of the inte:
