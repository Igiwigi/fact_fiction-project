Indeed, modern cognitive neuroscience acknow]l-
edges that much of cognition is ‘active’: we continuously
move our eyes to redirect visual input [7], we continuously
shift attention to redirect what information is processed, we
continuously interact with the environment, especially in
the case of a social encounter [8,9]. Current enthusiasm
about Bayesian or predictive coding approaches [10,11]
reflects this acknowledgement. But I am confused about
how and why one would need to adopt the IBH, as opposed
to one of its weaker forms, to incorporate these facts. To make
my confusion more transparent, consider three properties of a
person that we might want to understand: their observable
behaviour, their cognition and their conscious experience. Let’s consider these in the light of an experiment that IBH
advocates have mustered: the experiment by Auvray ef al.
[4], discussed above (cf. figure 1).
