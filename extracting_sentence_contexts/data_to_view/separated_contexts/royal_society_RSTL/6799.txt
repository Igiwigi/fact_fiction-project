Tux recent discovery by K1RcHHorP of the connexion between the dark lines of
the solar spectrum and the bright lines of terrestrial flames, s0 remarkable for the wide
range of its application, has placed in the hands of the experimentalist a method of
analysis which is not rendered less certain by the distance of the objects the light of
which is to be subjected to examination. The great success of this method of analysis
as applied by K1Rcynory to the determination of the nature of some of the constituents
of the sun, rendered it obvious that it would be an investigation of the highest interest, in
its relations to our knowledge of the general plan and structure of the visible universe, to
endeavour to apply this new method of analysis to the light which reaches the earth from
the fixed stars. Hitherto the knowledge possessed by man of these immensely distant
bodies has been almost confined to the fact that some of them, which observation shows
to be united in systems, are composed of matter subjected to the same laws of gravita-
tion as those which rule the members of the solar system. To this may be added the
high probability that they must be self-luminous bodies analogous to our sun, and pro-
bably in some cases even transcending it in brilliancy. Were they not self-luminous, it
would be impossible for their light to reach us from the enormous distances at which,
the absence of sensible parallax in the case of most of them shows, they must be placed
from our system.
