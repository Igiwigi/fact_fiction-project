Fig. 2 shows, in a diagrammatic form, the arrangement of the apparatus. A is
the copper electrolytic tube, from the right side of which issues the fluorine. In
order to prevent the escape of the vapour of hydrofluoric acid the exit tubes were

The refractometer tube, H, was of platinum-iridium, 45°78 centims. long and
0°65 centim. in diameter, Its volume, with the leads, was 15°01 cub. centims. Each
