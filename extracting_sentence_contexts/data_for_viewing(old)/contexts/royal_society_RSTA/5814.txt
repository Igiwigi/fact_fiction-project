]. Introduction

Ever since the appearance of the theorems about the existence of space-time singularities in
the sense of geodesic incompleteness of generic solutions in general relativity and cosmology
[1,2], and the first indications that the general solution cannot have a singularity of a power-
law character [3], the true nature of generic inhomogeneous solutions of the full Einstein
equations towards the cosmological singularity has been a formidable challenge. In fact, the
initial duality between the proved global geodesic incompleteness and the expected possibility of
local divergences in geometric and physical invariants, has been a major part of the cosmological
singularity problem ever since. It is still an ill-understood problem, but one that has stimulated a
lot of research.

For the cosmological singularity problem many conjectures have been formulated. One such
conjecture is about the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions to the gravitational equations, and
is based on a subsequent work of V. A. Belinski, I. M. Khalatnikov and E. M. Lifshitz (hereafter
abbreviated to ‘BKL’), the BKL conjecture [4,5]. This ‘BKL singularity’ is essentially of a new and
eminently complicated type, and no power-law behaviour may be ascribed to it. In the special,
homogeneous case, it is based on a generalized Kasner solution and a subsequent ‘Bianchi IX’
oscillatory behaviour having an endless sequence of Kasner epochs grouped into eras all the
