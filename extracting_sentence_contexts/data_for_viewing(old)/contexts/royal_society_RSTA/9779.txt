and the law is evident.

Art, 32. In general, supposing the lattice to be in the plane of ay, that of the
paper and the axis of z perpendicular to the plane of the paper, if we project the
partition on to the plane of yz, we obtain a partition at the nodes of a lattice of 1
rows in which the part magnitude in the s‘" columns is limited by the number a,.

The general formula for GF (7; a, dz, ..., @,) is remarkable from the fact that
GE (05 a,,.ds, ..-, Ga) = GE (L; b;, bs; -.-s bn),

where (cy, a, ..., Un), (D1, be, «.., bm) ave any two conjugate line partitions.

Adumbration of the Three-dimensional Theory.

Art. 33. [ conclude this Part by pointing out a path
of future investigation into the Theory of Partitions
in space of three dimensions.

I consider a complete or incomplete lattice in
three dimensions, the lines of the lattice being in
