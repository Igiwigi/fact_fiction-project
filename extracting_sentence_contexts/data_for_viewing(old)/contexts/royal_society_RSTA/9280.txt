the homogeneous case, but in which the “‘ apparent ” moduli are now, of course,
involved.

We conclude, therefore, that the existence of the annual layers does not of itself
explain the discrepancies above noted. We may also observe that the relative values
of yyy and yy,» are also not explained by this fact. For if we take p,, equal to u,,,
we find from the formule (20.3) and (20.4) that py, is greater than u,, (compare § 16),
whereas we invariably find from experiment that wry» is /ess than pyr.

§ 21. Effect of Cellular Structure on Moduli of Rigidity.—For all woods that have been
tested adequately it appears that prx > eur > per: the ratios of these moduli vary
considerably, but py» is always much less than the others (compare the table in § 2).
A reason for these facts is to be found in the cellular structure of wood, which we have
already briefly described. ‘Thus pyr is less than yyy or pyr because it relates to strains
which involve distortion of the cross-sections of the longitudinal cells, whereas the other
moduli are concerned with the longitudinal shearing of these cells. In a similar way
vir is less than py, because an LT-plane contains the cross-sections of the cells of the
medullary rays, while an LR-plane contains the longitudinal sections of these cells.

Compared with the Youna’s moduli, the rigidity moduli are found to be rather small.
Thus, for spruce pix = 0-055 E,, whereas for an isotropic substance p= 0-4 K
approximately. It is rather difficult to estimate the eflect of the cellular structure on
the ratios of the y’s to the E’s, but some information may possibly be gained as follows.
Suppose j5>4ix represents the modulus of rigidity for a pair of directions in the RL-plane
