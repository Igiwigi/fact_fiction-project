Moreover, the form of the papilla, which can
scarcely be called a penis, justifies the - inference that the act of intromission, if any,
would be short and easily interrupted. At any rate, I must leave the question as to the
mode of introduction of the spermatozoa, undecided for the present. The facts to be
hereafter mentioned as to the deyelopment of the ephippial egg render it probable that |
the impregnation takes place at an early period in the development of the ovarian egg,
which, unless the act is effected, gradually disappears. Daplnic may, however, be found in every stage of oyarian development united to one or
two males. I have found them 80 when the ovaries have been occupied only by nucleated
ovarian masses, when the eggs have been almost ready to escape into the receptacle, and
when the ephippium has been almost mature.
