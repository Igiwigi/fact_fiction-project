In some fer cases it never clothes itself with cilia, and then it almost always remains, as
long as it continues a planula, included within the gonophore ; while in the great majority
of cases it develops cilia over its surface, and becomes free and locomotive.

KLENENBERG, finding that in the adult Zydra the entire cellular ectoderm is composed
of the caudate cells with an interstitial network of simple cells interposed between their
proximal attenuated ends, while their wide distal ends form the outer surface of the
animal, concludes that there is here no external epithelium or epidermis. Hydra would
thus present an apparent, anomaly, inasgmuch as one of the most universal features in
ontogenesis—the development of an epidermal layer from the outer germ-lamella (ecto-
derm)—would seem to be absent.

This anomaly, however, is brought into agreement with the established facts of deve-
lopment by KLEINENBERG, whose obseryations have led him to maintain that the s0-called
egg-shell of Hydra is really a transformed epidermis, but, being needed only as a pro-
tective investment for the embryo, is a transitory structure destined to be cast off in the
later periods of development.

Though this may be a correct view of the state of things in Zydra, it is certain that
in Myriothela we have a perfectly distinct and well-developed layer which lies external
