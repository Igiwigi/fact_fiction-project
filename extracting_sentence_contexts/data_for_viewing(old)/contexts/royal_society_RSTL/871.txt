second{ plate has its lamine perpendicular to those of the first,
the light will be wholly reflected, and the luminous object will
cease to be visible.

Owing probably to a cause which will afterwards be noticed,
there is a faint nebulous light unconnected with the image,
though always accompanying it, and lying in a direction pa-
rallel to the lamine. This light never vanishes along with the
images, though it is evidently affected by the different changes
which they undergo; and in one of the specimens of agate, it
is distinctly incurvated, having the same radius of curvature
with the adjacent lamine. This character of the nebulous
light I consider as an important fact, which may be the means
of conducting us to a satisfactory theory, and I am at present
engaged in examining it with particular care,

This remarkable property of the agate I have found also in
the kindred substances of cornelian and chalcedony, and it is
exhibited in its full effect even when these bodies are formed
into prisms, and when the incident rays fall with any angle
of obliquity. In one specimen of agate, which has no veins
to indicate the direction in which it was cut, the images did
not vanish as before; and in another specimen- of the same
