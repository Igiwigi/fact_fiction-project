asserted that the teeth of Meganthropus are humanoid rather than ape-like, and Weidenreich
(1945) has claimed that ‘Gigantopithecus is not an anthropoid but a typical hominid’. Of
the fossils considered in this paper, only the jaw of Eoanthropus is generally regarded as
uncertain in status. Many who have studied the data have emphasized the contrast
between it and the associated human brain-case of the Piltdown Man. Some, however,
have been able to discern humanoid characteristics in the teeth, while others, failing to
agree, have been satisfied to regard the jaw as that of an ape which by chance came to lie
in the same geological deposit.

The comparisons set out in this paper do not directly qualify any statements that have
been made about the humanoid proportions of all these teeth. They show, however, that
many supposed divergences in shape and size from the apes have little, if any, foundation
in fact. Indeed, hardly one of the teeth considered in this paper cannot be matched in
dimensions and shape by the corresponding tooth of at least one type of extant great ape.
In some cases, moreover, all or many of the teeth of a fossil correspond with those of one
type of modern ape. This is borne out by table 11, which summarizes the resemblances
revealed by our comparisons. It shows, for example, that of the fifty-five teeth attributed
to Proconsul, fifty do not differ in any dimension from the corresponding teeth of the
chimpanzee, and that of twenty-three teeth where both dimensions and indices are avail-
able, nineteen are not different. Again, of twenty-one teeth attributed to Plesianthropus,
none differs in dimensions from the orang, and only two from the gorilla. Of the eighteen
teeth where both dimensions and indices are available, none differs from the orang and
only two from the gorilla.
