The means of the hourly readings on four days in each month,
corrected for moisture, give a mean curve of pressure in each month which nearly
corresponds with the curve of pressure of the daily readings of the barometer cor-
rected for temperature only. The maximum pressure with both corrections occurs
in December, but the minimum occurs in June corrected for temperature and in July
with both corrections. The whole of the facts connected with the meteorology of
Aden of which I have made use, are from observations taken by Sergeant Moyss,
with excellent instruments, and Dr. Butsr is now passing the observations through
the press. These facts, which could be very greatly multiplied, have been somewhat dwelt
upon, with a view to a right understanding of HumBoLprT's observations in his Cosmos*,

where, speaking of the horary oscillations of the barometer, be says, Â© their regularity
is 80 great, that in the day-time especially, the hour may be ascertained from the
height of the mercurial column without error, on the average of fifteen or seventeen
minutes.
