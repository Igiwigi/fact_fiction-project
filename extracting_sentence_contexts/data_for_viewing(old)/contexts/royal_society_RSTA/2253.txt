a set X of random variables, its coupling is defined as a set X of jointly distributed random
variables, in a bijective correspondence with 1’, such that for any ) C *, if the elements of Y are
jointly distributed, then the corresponding subset Y C X has the same distribution. In particular,
corresponding elements of ¥ and X are identically distributed.*

In contextuality analysis of a consistently connected system, one is interested in whether
among all possible couplings of a system of random variables one can find one with a special
property. This property is that in each connection, i.e. each column of (3.1), the two random

?This property is known in physics under a variety of names, such as no-signalling, no-disturbance, parameter invariance,
etc. [33]. In psychology, it is known under the name of simple marginal selectivity. The term ‘consistent connectedness’ is
less connotationally loaded than most of these terms. It is a naturally formed term in CbD, because contexts in this theory
are represented by isolated ‘islands’ of random variables, and they are only ‘connected’ to each other by the fact that some
variables in different contexts have the same content. The set of all variables R¢ with the same content q is then natural to call
a connection [34].

3The term ‘measured together’ usually means simultaneously, but it can be any empirical scheme by which the values of two
variables are paired. They can be measured at different times, as in the Leggett-Garg-type experiments [12,35], and they can
be related to the same or different physical objects. This is one reason my analysis is not critically related to such issues as
commutativity of the quantum operators generating the random variables.

variables are equal to each other with probability 1. If such a coupling exists (in CbD it is called
