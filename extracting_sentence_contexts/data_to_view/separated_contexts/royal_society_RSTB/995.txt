The upright of the T-piece was connected with a manomete
was found however after repeated trial that the difficulties in the employme it
method were very great. In the first place the pressure inside the gut require
high, and very frequently caused rupture, and in the second place—ap
leakage—the pressure in the veins registered by the manometer diminished. |
rently this was due to the fact that the ligature expelled the blood and lymp
the superficial parts of the limb, which therefore yielded and consequently d "
the pressure on the limb. This method was given up therefore and an elastic li
with direct measurement of the venous blood-pressure was adoped as the us nthe
of procedure.
