roots are not simultaneously real. In the absence, however, of these considerations,
we learn that there are not more than ten points on the surface of the earth at which
the needle can be yertical; and that whatever may be the number of them, it is at
all events even, viz. 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10. We also learn that how many soever of these
be real, they are all in one plane passing through the centre of the earth; and with
respect to the great circle in which it cuts the terrestrial surface, taken as the axis
of spherical coordinates, all magnetic phenomena on the surface of the earth are $ym-
metrically disposed. How far this is verified, within the limits of errors of observation
and of local interference with the full development of the effects of the magnetic
force, has not yet been inquired into. Indeed, till this plane has been determined it
would be impossible to conduct the inquiry in a direct manner; and as only one of
these points is yet actually assigned with any close degree of approximation, we
are not yet ina condition to enter upon the inquiry. Still, these facts combined with
observations relative to other phenomena, especially respecting dip and intensity,
(the variation for obvious geometrical reasons included,) accurately made, might
furnish important aid in a tentative determination of the plane itself; the method of
proceeding in which must be sufficiently obvious to those inquirers to whose minds
the geometry of coordinates is familiar.
