Giuseppe Longobardi An unresolved problem of historical linguistics is how much similarity is
e-mail: giuseppe.longobardi@york.ac.uk required to demonstrate language relatedness when regular sound correspon-

dences are absent, ie. when one lacks the standard tool for scientifically
grounding lexical etymologies. Even the success of modern quantitative
approaches to phylogenetic linguistics ([1] and [2] and all successive work) is
in fact based on—and delimited by—this classical tool.

Historical linguists have explicitly stated the need for new methods to
address the relatedness issue [3-5], in order to provide classifications deeper
than traditional etymological families [6,7]. We propose a way to tackle this
long-standing issue by combining the Parametric Comparison Method (PCM,
[8-10]) with a theory of possible languages (see [11]) and with dedicated statisti-
cal tools.

Within the minimalist biolinguistic program [12-15], a lot of focus has
shifted from the ontogeny to the phylogeny and evolution of language, but
little has been done to address the problem from the bottom, ie. starting
from comparing historically attested grammars. The PCM compares languages
