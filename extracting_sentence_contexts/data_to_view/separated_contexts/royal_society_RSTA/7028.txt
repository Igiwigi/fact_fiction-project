STRESS DISTRIBUTION IN A FLANGED BEAM 421

By inserting practical figures in equation (3) it will be found that the boom displace-
ment terms in S are quite negligible both compared with those in M and with those in $
in equation (2). Accordingly, it will be sufficiently accurate to take the boom displacements

a result which would be achieved by treating the boom as a beam obeying the elementary

theory of bending and using the rigid-body conditions u = dv/dx = OF and Upoom = Yweb

at x = 0. In future we shall in fact treat the boom by this method, an approximation which
Acan be justified arithmetically at any time by investigating the magnitude of the shear
distortion terms as given by equation (3). Ee Apt,

Uveb = 6Gl (6)

Engineers’ theory of bending thus leads to incompatibilities of vertical displacement at
the junction of boom and web and of horizontal displacement at the centre line of the beam
(the loading section).{ In addition, the distribution of shear associated with this theory is

+ Strictly, dv/8x = vSy?/2EI, but the difference from zero is negligible.
+ Auxiliary calculations have shown that of these two errors the former is by far the more important.
