Alcohol falls in the greatest degree below water in capillarity, yet the former sub-
Stance is one of the least remarkable for the power to occasion osmose.

The newer facts to be related also increase the difficulties Fig. 1.
of the capillary theory of osmose.

My own experiments on osmose were made with both mine-
ral and organic septa.

I. A convenient earthenware or baked clay osmometer is
easily formed by fitting a glass tube and cover to the mouth
of the porous cylinder, often used as a cell in Grove's battery,
as in fig. 1; the cylinder was generally 5 inches in depth by
17 inch in width, inside measure, and was capable of holding
about six ounces of water. Gutta percha is much preferable
to brass as the material for the cap or cover. The glass tube
