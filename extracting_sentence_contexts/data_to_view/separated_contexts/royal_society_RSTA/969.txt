The
Darwin width of the reflectivity curve at the particular wavelength acts as a fine angular
filter. This idea proved remarkably successful. In fact, by changing the reflection angle of the
analyser crystal, rays with a narrow range of scatter angles could be used to create images;
providing useful alternative image information other than simple attenuation. The sensitivity
of this technique to sample density changes turned out to be exquisite [11]. The technique
