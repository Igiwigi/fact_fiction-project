the fusion of these axons is complete, and that in no sense can the resulting axon be
considered as a bundle of separate fibres or fibrils, each derived from one of the
parent cells. This is shown by the following facts: (1) That the whole is enclosed in a
single sheath (Young 1936¢; Bear, Schmitt and Young 1937), of the sort which normally

encloses a single neural unit. (2) The axoplasm appears homogeneous in transverse
and longitudinal section. The question of the status of the excessively fine fibrils
which may under some circumstances be seen within it is discussed in the above
papers. In no case do they give the appearance of subdividing the fibre into units.
(3) On section of a fresh axon the axoplasm flows from the cut end of the sheath
(Young 1935, 1936c). (4) The synapses described below (p. 489) are made by means
