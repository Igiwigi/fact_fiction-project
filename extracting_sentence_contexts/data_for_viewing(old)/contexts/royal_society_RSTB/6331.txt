Source of material—Type colony in British Museum, from the Challenger
Expedition near Kerguelen Islands.

Remarks—The type colony alone is in good condition and available for examina-
tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids within the colony are distended
with developing embryos precludes any possibility of obtaining more than a
fragmentary view of the process of budding, for sexual and asexual modes of repro-
duction are not mutually compatible. There is some evidence, however, that the
colony in question was taken near the end of the sexual breeding season, with a few
zooids entering the asexual phase.

The zooids are smaller and the colony more pedunculate than Diazona and the
relationship with the synoicids even more pronounced. In fact, the zooids resemble
those of the synoicids in the presence of a true post-abdomen containing heart and
gonads.

Formation of buds—The great majority of zooids in the colony are breeding
individuals, but a few are evidently in the throes of budding. As in Diazona, there
is a disintegration of the anterior part of the zooid and a concentration of food-laden
cells posteriorly. The dissolution is not confined to the branchial. region, but
involves the whole of the gut so that only the post-abdomen survives. Only a few
instances were found where the post-abdomen had apparently constricted into two
parts, most showing evidence of commencing regeneration without having divided,
but there is every likelihood that colonies taken at a later period of the year would
show a larger proportion of zooids in fission or even in multiple constriction.
