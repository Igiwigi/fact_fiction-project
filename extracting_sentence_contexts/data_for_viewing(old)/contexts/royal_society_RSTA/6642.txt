striation thickness and stretching are related in a fundamental way to dynamical
systems concepts: entropy, finite-size Lyapunov exponents, and the Baker transfor-
mation. For a more complete coverage the reader should consult Ottino (1989), Aref
(1991) and Wiggins & Ottino (2004).

The key to effective mixing lies in producing stretching and folding; stretching and
folding may be roughly equated with chaos (see Wiggins & Ottino 2004). The sim-
plest case corresponds to two dimensions. If the velocity field is steady, the mixing
is poor and stretching for long times is linear, as in the case of a simple shear flow;
i.e. the stretching rate of line elements decays as 1/t (we are restricting ourselves
to bounded flows, that is were excluding elongational flows here). It is relatively
straightforward to produce flow fields that can generate stretching and folding and
hence chaos. In fact the most important lesson that should be learned about kine-
matics and mixing is encapsulated by the link twist maps (LTMs; see Wiggins &
Ottino 2004). In rough terms, a necessary condition for chaos is the ‘crossing’ of
streamlines (this must occur at different times). That is, two successive streamline
portraits, say at t and t + At for time-periodic two-dimensional flows, or at z and
z + Az for spatially periodic flows, when superimposed, should show intersecting
streamlines when projected onto the (x, y)-plane. In two-dimensional systems this
can be achieved by time modulation of the flow field, for example, by motions of
boundaries or time periodic changes in geometry.

Numerous experimental studies have revealed the structure of chaotic flows. Dye
structures of passive tracers placed in time-periodic chaotic flows evolve in an itera-
