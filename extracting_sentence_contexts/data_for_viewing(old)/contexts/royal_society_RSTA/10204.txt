ordinary value of «, there exists a linear relation between log D and log U, leading to
a relation of the form K = D/U", where x is for various electrolytes nearly but not
quite two thirds. (See Appendix.)

This suggested that if we could find a suitable correction for «, which 1s usually
taken as \/A, the Van ’t Hoff dilution law would turn out to be an ewact relation for
dilute solutions of binary electrolytes such as KCl.

The materials for such a correction were sought in the known fact that the viscosity
of the solution produced aberrations in the mobilities of the ions, but viscosity
differences alone were inadequate to give an account of such aberrations.

KouLRravscu’s observations on the temperature coefficients of the ions had already
led him to the general view that the ions must be considered to be water-coated.
This water combination necessarily altered the sizes of the ions, and it was considered
that the joint effect of changes of viscosity and changes of size might adequately
account for changes in the mobility.

To reckon these eflects quantitatively, Srokxs’ theorem as to the motion of a small
sphere in a viscous medium was available, and though the actual motion of the ions
through an electrolyte under the influence of a potential gradient is probably
