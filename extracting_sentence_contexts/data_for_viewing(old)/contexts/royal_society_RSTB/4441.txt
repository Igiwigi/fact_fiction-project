extremely small post-temporal fossa.

The posterior surface of the exoecipital just above the condyle shows a small
hypoglossal foramen, in front of which is a much bigger foramen for the vagus. On
the right side only there is another small venous foramen.

The posterior edge of the pterygoid, when seen from behind, turns outward and
downwards, as already described, along the inner face of the quadrate.

The quadrate is a remarkable bone of triangular horizontal section. The inner flat
face of the bone is covered by the pterygoid. The anterior face is slightly convex
and faces the infra-temporal fossa. The third face is concave and is covered by the
squamosal above and the quadratojugal below. This latter bone is, in fact, split so as
to cover some of the anterior face as well. The quadrate ends below in a very
remarkable nearly hemispherical condyle.

Squamosal.â€”The squamosal, so far as it appears on the posterior surface, is
described here. It has a suture with the tabular, below which it forms a somewhat
triangular area, terminating below in a suture with the quadratojugal. This posterior
surface is concave, so that its inner margin is turned backwards as a flange with a
free edge parallel to that formed by the pterygoid, from which it is separated by the
posterior edge of the quadrate.

The quadratojugal on the posterior surface continues the squamosal, but does not
contribute to the flange, its split lower and inner edge clasps the outer corner of
