corresponding ¢ link for », 7.e., a separation produced by a second A, displacement
is 833°84, or with a modified ¢’ (33) = 830°70. These suggest triplets formed by the
same A,, A, on p (—A,) instead of on p, in other words, series whose limits are
5102541778 = 52808, 54675°6, 55509°4. But the way in which the separations
enter with the suggested D line 20812 indicates that they stand in fundamental
relation to it and neither in a linkage relation, nor with the limits named. For in
the latter cases it would throw out of gear the whole relation of 20312 with the D set,
which some provisional work had seemed to establish. In this work they were
considered as part of the D system through 20312 regarded as a D, (1) line with
18447, 17615 as satellites. In this case the d, sequence is of the order 51025
—20312 = 30718. As against this idea is, of course, the greater intensity of 18447,
the supposed satellite over that of the D,,, and also the fact that no normal »

separation occurs with 18447 or 1, v. with 17615. But provisionally that was set aside
for the moment. If they represented a special D set, the separations ought to
reappear in a triplet series of the F type, and in the reverse order. From the sets
