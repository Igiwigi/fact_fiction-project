The meshes of the delicate fibrillar matrix in which these large spherites are
deposited are probably filled with the albuminoid matter which Leon Wi.itams
considers to be poured out by the ameloblast cells, and we must suppose that the
salts are dialysed into this collagenous organic substance and there form the
calcospherites, as in the experiment with albumen devised by Prof. Hartine.

In my slides of the first formed enamel, fibres can be very distinctly seen in
many places, crossing the prisms at an angle; and the whole of the enamel,
prisms, and prismatic substance would seem to be laid down in this network of
fibres.

Tt is not always the fact that all traces of this substance are lost in calcification,
for in some cases this fibrillar basis material can be seen in the completed enamel of
marsupials. In two instances in which I succeeded in staining the enamel very
completely, in the one case with fuchsin, and in the other with silver nitrate, it can

be seen that small portions of the fibrillar matrix have escaped calcification and have
taken the stain deeply (Plate 8, fig. 7).

The fibres are seen crossing the stained tubes in the tubular enamel exactly as in
