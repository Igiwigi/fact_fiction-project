27A*+2m(81f—9%)A—w(m—z)=0.
This equation will give two equal yalues for A if
m(8m*—92)* +27&(m*—z)=0,
an equation which reduces itself to
(41*—3%)*=0.

Whence, if 49*—3& be negative, 7. 6. if E> the values of A will be imaginary, but

m_ 4m? - 2
if 4?—3% be positive, or «< =, the values of A will be real. If a= =, then there

will be two equal values of A, which in fact corresponds to a cusp upon the axis of #.
Whenever the curve is real there will be at least two real points on the axis of #; and

when 4 < =, but not otherwise, then for properly selected values of A there will be
four real points on the axis of vx.
Differentiating the equation of the curve, we have
((a*+1*—e)v+ 4A)dr+(a*+3*—e)ydy=0 5

and if in this equation we put dx=0, we find y=0, or a*+y*—&=0, 5. e. that the points
on the axis of z, and the points of intersection with the circle 2*+y*—«=0, are the only
points at which the curve is perpendicular to the axis of az. To find the points at which
the curve is parallel to the axis of xz, we must write dx=0, this gives
