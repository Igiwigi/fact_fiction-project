The rate of fall on the negative side is the same when v/v, = 1°37 as when
it = 1°30. It is true that we would expect the drops if equally numerous to fall
slightly quicker with the greater expansion, since a rather larger quantity of water
would be condensed ; against this is to be set the fact that the positive minority on
the negative side are caught by means of the greater expansion, and not by the less. It will be convenient to consider here what light the new knowledge now acquired
throws upon phenomena previously observed in the course of experiments with
expansion apparatus. ;

All the former measurements which I have published upon the least expansion
required to make condensation take place in presence of ions, are now seen to have
been concerned with negative ions only.
