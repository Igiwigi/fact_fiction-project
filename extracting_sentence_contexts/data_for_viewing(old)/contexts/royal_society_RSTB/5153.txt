of the sub-mucous or myenteric plexuses, although the axones of these cells could fre-
quently be traced in serial sections to their terminations in the smooth muscle of the
villi. Kuntz (36) states that these fibres ‘* are present in such abundance that they could
not be accounted for as visceral afferent fibres contained in the vagus and spinal nerves,
even though we should admit of the most profuse branching.” Whilst not wishing to call
in question Kunrz’s statement regarding the number of visceral afferent fibres contained
in the extrinsic nerves to the intestine, it seems to me, in view of the fact that chemical
or mechanical stimulation of the intestinal mucosa causes an inhibition of tonus and a
contraction of the empty stomach, primarily, at any rate, through a central reflex path
(BRUNEMERER and Carison (8) ), that some at least of these endings in the epithelium
of the mucosa are those of extrinsic fibres.

The facts that the neurones of Type II (Docret’s sensory Type II) receive the peri-
cellular arborizations of the vagal fibres and that these cells probably constitute the
second neurone in the vagal path and are therefore motor in function, render it difficult to
see how a reflex arc can exist in the intestinal wall. It seems more probable that the
myenteric reflex is, as suggested by E. Mixer, of the nature of an axone reflex,
such as has been described in the bladder and skin of the cat by Langtry and
ANDERSON (38) and more recently by Kroc (33) in blood-vessels and capillaries.
Although such an assumption in the case of the myenteric reflex appears to be
impossible of direct experimental proof, elements which may well be the seat of such
reflexes, viz., the unipolar cells, are present in considerable numbers, and, indeed, this
seems to be the only means of explaining the localized reflex acts of the intestinal
wall when all connections with the higher centres have been removed.
