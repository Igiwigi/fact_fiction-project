The positive response to light, the positive effect of tetanisation, and the positive
after-effect of condenser discharges are suppressed by anesthetics (ether and chloro-
form) and by rise of temperature (to 40—45°). The suppression may be permanent
or temporary, An anesthetised like a dead eyeball tested by single currents manifests
only polarisation effects negative in direction to the exciting currents. Tetanisation
then gives only polarisation effect in the direction of the break shocks, negative to the
direction of the make shocks.


EXCITED BY LIGHT AND EXCITED ELECTRICALLY. 163

As regards inferences from the facts, and the theoretical signification of the latter,
Tam very unwilling to commit myself too absolutely to any theoretical conclusions.
T believe it to be proved by these observations that the retina is the seat of a double
electrical movement, a simultaneous positive and negative effect, but whether this
double effect is the expression of duplex change in one substance, or of two changes
in two different components, cannot be strictly demonstrated, and must remain matter
of opinion. Iam of the opinion that we have to do with a duplex change, construc-
tive and disruptive, in one substance. The further question as to the correspondence
of the two hypothetical movements with the two obvious electrical movements
appears to me to be an open question, KtHne and Srermer, without committing
themselves very absolutely, indicate as their opinion that a positive electrical effect
is the token of regeneration, and a negative electrical effect the token of decom-
position, I have no serious objection to this view, nevertheless I hesitate to adopt it,
