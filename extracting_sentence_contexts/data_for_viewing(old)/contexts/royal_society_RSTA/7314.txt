No attempt will be made to get numerical results for arbitrary elevations of the trans-
mitter and receiver directly from the formulae given above, and in the next section we
proceed to a discussion of the ground-to-ground field. It is, however, desirable to check that,
in the general case, the solution is continuous across @-+ 0) = 17, particularly in view of the
fact that the subsequent analysis centres on an examination of the field at points on this line.

The discontinuity in the geometrical optics term (99), found by subtracting its value at
4 +6, = 1—e from that at 6+-0) = +e, where e-> 0, is

It is not difficult to show that (137) is balanced by the discontinuity in the diffraction term.
This latter arises solely from the first expression on the right-hand side of (133) ; in fact, using
(118) and noting that B = 0 on 0+0, = 17,
