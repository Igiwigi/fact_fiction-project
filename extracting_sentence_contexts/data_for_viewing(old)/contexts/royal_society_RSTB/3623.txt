The estimate shows that the average values of the summits and depressions have
the following relation to each other in the separate leads :—

Dd a coe S>S'>S*
P>U>Q 1 hp hoe ot bd
R>R>R > U'> UV?

With the exception of Q, which has its greatest average value in lead J/J, the
remaining summits and depressions have their greatest values in lead JJ; this fact is
an argument in favour of the adoption of lead 7/, when a single lead is alone
employed. Three of the deflections, P, Q, and F, have their smallest average values
in lead J, and three, S, 7, and U, in lead ZZ.

The P-R Interval.*—The measurement of P-R intervals has been taken in
lead IJ only, because P is usually most prominent in this lead. The measurements
in lead J and lead J/J are generally within a hundredth of a second of this
measurement, but there may be slight differences from lead to lead. The limits of
duration of the P-—R interval are 0°13 to 0°21 sec.; and these measurements
apply to heart rates varying from 48 to 109 per minute. The most frequent
measurements are from 0°13 sec. to 0°16 sec. The maximum value, 0°21, occurred
on a solitary occasion, and 0°18 and 0°19 are infrequent in incidence. There is little
