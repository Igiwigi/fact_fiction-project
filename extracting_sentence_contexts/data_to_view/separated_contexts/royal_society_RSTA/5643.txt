For our particular construction
a non-interacting particle advances one space unit ¢ during two time units é. We can keep the
normalization of the velocity to one by choosing the time difference @ between neighbouring
lattice points as €=e/2. The disadvantage of integrating out the intermediate Grassmann
variables w(t + (€/2),x) consists in the fact that both the Grassmann basis functions g; and the
conjugate Grassmann basis functions %, are needed for an extraction of Sit) from K(t), and the
simplicity of the exponential factors may not be maintained. It is often advantageous to keep the simple exponential form of the local factors also for the
coarse grained view. This can be done by doubling the number of Grassmann variables at every f.
