of this system of particles, does it possess oxidizing properties which otherwise it has
not? On the view I have stated the cause is plain. When nitric oxide acts chemi-
cally upon oxygen, the gas is thrown into a polar condition ; the result of which is
to give to other particles of the mass a combining power, in a direction the reverse
of that in which the oxygen combines with the nitric oxide; the change being in all
respects analogous to the decomposition of water by the joint action of nitric oxide
and chlorine*; thus—

ER,

The best of the other explanations of this fact is, in my opinion, that of P#1160Tf, who
considers the formation of the sulphuric acid to be the result of the successive forma-
tion and decomposition of nitric acid. This, however, does but shift the difficulty to
another point ; for why does nitric acid oxidize sulphurous acid? In truth, in this
case, a perfectly similar polarization takes place within the acid itself—

* In the following experiments I am compelled to call by the zame name three very different things—the
isolated element, the particles of the element at the moment of their chemical separation or synthesis, and the
combined element; and I wish to observe, that when I «tate that there is a chemical difference between the
