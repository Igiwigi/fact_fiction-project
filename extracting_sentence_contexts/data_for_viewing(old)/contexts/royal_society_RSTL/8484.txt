N =g, tre + &c., we have 8H, Sp &c., all of
them expressible as determinate Fae Lib of u; = we have moreover the theorem that
each of these is a rational and integral function of u: we have thus the series of equations

Sy=4 3g=D, -- Sy =H,
where A, B, ... H are rational and integral functions of uv. These give linearly the
different values of 3 we have in fact

where Sv, Sv,v,, &c. denote the combinations formed with the roots »,, v,, . . . v, (these can
be expressed in terms of the single root v,); and we have also (v,—2,)...(%—9,)=F'(vy):
the resulting equation is- consequently F'o, RY =R(«, v,), R a determinate rational and

integral function of (, 2) ; but as the same formula exists for each root of the modular
equation, we may herein write M, » in place of M,, v,; and the formula thus is
