MARIA M. OGILVIE ON THE MICROSCOPIC AND Yet, in all three genera, the soft parts of adjacent polyps are continuous. In Mussa,
it is true, groups of adjacent polyps become independent of one another in the corallum
correlated with the branching growth,

The facts show three different forms of the extracalycinal skeletal parts. In
Galaxea, the cost are narrow, and the intermediate space between calyces is entirely
occupied by dissepiments. In Heliastrwa, the costee are so wide as to come usually
into contact, dissepiments being developed between them.
