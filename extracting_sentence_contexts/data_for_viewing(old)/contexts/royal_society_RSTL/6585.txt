This example has been s0 chosen as to admit of easy verification. In fact 4=2:30625,

and log}=z YH1=1og 259=0- 40330 93959 24. The error is therefore only of three units
in the tenth decimal place, where there was no reason to expect accuracy.

26. The only other formulze which I shall give are the following, for finding the
logarithm of a number, and vice vers. They are indispensable where more than seven

figures are required.
Let log (y+k)=log ax +k, then

log k=log (=) 3 F3 mb nearly 6
log h=log (Mzk)+ I k nearly.
