crust formation at 100% R.H. resulted in poor cocoon formation and a highly significant
retardation in the larval growth when compared with 90 and 94-8 % r.u. In one experi-
ment with X. brasiliensis, marked with an asterisk, when the mixture was disturbed daily,
there was 100 % success in rearing adults in a time not significantly longer than at optimum
humidities.

At 32°C as the food and sand mixture was often disturbed at 97-5 and 100% R.u.,
there was a good success in the development of rat-flea larvae. At 97-5°%, R.H. almost all
the larvae of X. cheopis and X. astia (tables 23, 24) were reared into adults in a period not
statistically longer than at 80% r.u. But at 100% R.H., even when the mixture was often
disturbed, its choking effect was felt prominently towards the end; consequently, a large
number of the males of X. cheopis and X. brasiliensis died, perhaps of suffocation. This is also
borne out by the fact that though the active larval life of these species was shorter, yet the
combined larval and pupal life of the males was longer at this humidity than at the other
favourable humidities. At 100% R.u. there was an appreciably better success in the
development of the larvae of X. astia than in the other two species, when kept under
identical conditions.

At 35° C the ill effect of 100% r.n. on the larvae of X. brasiliensis (table 25) was most
pronounced; a significantly higher proportion of them failed to complete their active larval
life, and died in a highly significantly shorter time than at 90% r.u. Many of the larvae
of X. cheopis (tables 23, 24) grew at 97-5 and 100% R.H. with 35-3° C; but about half of them
spun cocoons in a highly significantly shorter time than that at 80°% R.H. In general, few
adults were reared, and the death occurred in different stages of development from
second larval instar upwards. At 100% R.H., provided the food and sand mixture was
