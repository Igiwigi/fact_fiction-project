tends to be distorted while impacting with the lower boundary before occupying the channel.
This behaviour can also be confirmed while looking at figure 12b where a small recirculation area
is still present for PS although the ligament is penetrating into the gasket. Some deformation of
the jet can be observed for ABS as well, in this case, however, the fingering effect is limited and
the interface is flatter than PS one. For a complete analysis, in figure 13 the different stress tensor
components have been plotted at the two non-dimensional times presented in figure 12.

Similar to what was already obtained for the lower Reynolds number, for this operating
condition the same considerations can be traced by looking at the non-dimensional viscosity
profile reported in figure 14.

It is worth noting that differences in terms of non-dimensional viscosity are more evident at
lower Reynolds number than in the case of the higher one. This is basically due to the fact that
at low Reynolds number the stress tensor tends to assume smaller values, due to the reduced
velocity, moving the viscosity ratio towards 1 (v= vo). At Re=0.15, the average velocity has
increased, and the stress components tend to increase when lowering the local viscosity, with
results far from its plateau value.

(b) Injection in a porous medium

The second application which has been implemented and analysed is the injection in a porous
domain. As already stated in §2d, the porous domain has been modelled through the random
packing spheres approach, widely used to characterize fluid dynamics of open-cell metal foams
[38,69,71]. With respect to metal foam characteristics two main quantities are generally needed for
their characterization: the porosity €, which represents the ratio between air and metal volumes,
