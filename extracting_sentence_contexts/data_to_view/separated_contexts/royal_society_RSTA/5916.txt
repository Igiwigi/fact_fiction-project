It is seen that there
is a strong correlation near t= 1 which gradually decreases with increasing 4x. The short time
correlations in both Models A and B are negative. This is consistent with the fact that direction
reversal probability is greater than 1/ 2. However, for one particular 4; the correlation ultimately
saturates to a value Csat when tf > oo. This kind of feature was earlier noted in [46].
