pressure. In the second place it has been shown that increase of venous p
not accompanied by a corresponding increase in the rapidity of the lymph-flo
propositions, therefore, have been answered in the negative.

It was next shown that section of a nerve has no influence upon the speeifie g
of muscles supplied by it: this is contrary to what should occur upon Rany
of the exudation as being the result of increased tension.

The explanation of passive cedema as a purely mechanical phenomenon, dut
increased rapidity of filtration through the walls of the blood-vessels, is theref
borne out by experiment. }

Reference has already shortly been made to the fact that a ligature pla
dog’s limb often causes oedema to appear not only on the distal but al
proximal side of the ligature. In itself, this is a powerful argument ag
influence of venous congestion as a direct cause, since the parts on the twos
the ligature are obviously in very different conditions, so far as concerns ye!
congestion.

So far us the specific gravity of the arterial blood and blood-plasma,
blood and blood-plasma, muscle, and skin of parts other than the affected
concerned, the effects of haemostasis are practically nil. It has no effect, moreo
the specific gravity of the muscle or skin of the affected limb, but it occasions:
