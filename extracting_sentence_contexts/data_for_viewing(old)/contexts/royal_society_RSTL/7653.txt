:2 The curve representing the. results at 215 agrees in general form with that for
'813%1, as 8hown in the above figure. At 13%1, under a pressure of about 49 atmospheres,
he volume of carbonic acid is little more than three-fifths of that which a perfect gas
would occupy under the same conditions. After liquefaction carbonic acid yields to
Spressure much more than ordinary liquids; and the compressibility appears to diminish
Ds the pressure increases. 'The high rate of expansion by heat of liquid carbonic acid,
Sfirst noticed by TriLortgR, is fully confirmed by this investigation.
j The next series of experiments was made at the temperature of 31*1, or 0*2 above
=the point at which, by compression alone, carbonic acid is capable of assuming visibly the
Ziquia form. Since I first announced this fact in 1863, I have made careful experiments
Sto fix precisely the temperature of this critical point in the case of carbonic acid. It
was found in three trials to be 3092 C., or 87%7 Fans. Although for a few degrees
Stbors this temperature a rapid fall takes place from increase of pressure, when the gas
Zis reduced to the yolume at which it might be expected to liquefy, no separation of the
Nearbonie acid into two distinet conditions of matter occurs, s0 far as any indication of
such a separation is afforded by the action of light. By varying the pressure or tempe-
rature, but always keeping the latter above 30*92, the great changes of density which
occur about this point produce the flickering movements I formerly described, resembling
in an exaggerated form the appearances exhibited during the mixture of liquids of dif-
ferent densities, or when columns of heated air ascend through colder strata. It is easy
80 to adjust the pressure that one-half of the tube shall be filled with uncondensed gas
and one-half with the condensed liquid. Below the critical temperature this distinction
