less.

The first of these is silver-gold, where both metals are univalent, and both solvent
and solute have almost exactly the same atomic diameters (2-88 A). In this system
the freezing point curve passes continuously from the melting point of silver (961°) to
that of gold (1065°).* According to Roperrs-Austen and Kirxs-Rosef the gold-
rich alloys have freezing points which are almost indistinguishable from those of pure
gold, so that the initial depression of freezing point is zero. This has been disputed by
Rayoprt,t but this investigator only examined a very few alloys, so that the evidence is
incomplete. In any case, however, the initial depression of freezing point at the gold
end of this system is less than 1° per 1 atomic °% of silver, whilst the work of Hzycock
and Nevinwe (loc. cit.) shows that the rise of freezing point at the silver end of this
system is also less than 1° per 1 atomic %. In our opinion this is a fact of great signi-
ficance. In the systems copper-silver and copper-gold, the two metals are of the same
valency, but of different atomic diameters, and here we have steep falls of freezing point

* The alloys of gold with the B group element are not considered in this paper, but in general they exhibit
many of the characteristics of the corresponding alloys of silver.
