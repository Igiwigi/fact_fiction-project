Manufactured learning environments that leverage exploratory behaviours and facilitate manageable prediction errors are
then fundamental when we turn to imagine the implementation of different, by definition, disembodied artefacts such as LLMs. LLMs’ potential impact on education has generated a variety of responses, from fear to enthusiasm to immediate applicative
attempts in a variety of contexts (e.g.[219-225]; for a summarizing commentary, see [30]). If it seems clear that LLMs are here
to stay and their integration in education is not challenge-free, then ‘a clear pedagogical approach with a strong focus on
critical thinking and strategies for fact checking are required’ ([30], p. 1). That is, it isn’t enough to simply have LLMs lying
around, using them to produce and spoon-feed information on command. Their functions, strengths and limitations need to be
overseen in a structured way, since—as disembodied entities—LLMs ‘are fundamentally incapable of understanding people's
embodied interactions’ [226].
