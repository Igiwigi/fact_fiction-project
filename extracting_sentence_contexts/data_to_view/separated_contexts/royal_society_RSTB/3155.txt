is released, the spring gives the balance wheel a small impulse and starts the
clock again. When the shutter is closed, the camera part of the recorder becomes a complete
light-tight box, and, by removing the screws, this camera. may be detached from
the rest of the apparatus and taken to a dark-room, for inserting or removing the
sensitised paper. As a matter of fact, I found that it was practically impossible to detach this
light-tight recording box (ot which the weight was 40 Ibs.) without entirely
deranging the whole adjustment of the apparatus, and I accordingly devised a small
chamber, the walls of which were composed of ruby-red tissue, and which were
impermeable to any but red rays, which permitted of the sensitised paper being
introduced and removed from the apparatus (see figs. 4 and 4A, p. 229). After a run
of, say, 24 hours, the roll of paper is removed, placed in light-tight paper, and
taken to the dark-room for development. The paper which I employ in the
photographie recorder is the seismograph paper supplied by the Kodak Company
to all the seismograph stations in this country.
