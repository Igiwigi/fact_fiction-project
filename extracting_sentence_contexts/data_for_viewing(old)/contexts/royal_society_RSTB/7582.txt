530 D. CHITTY ON MORTALITY AMONG VOLES

Areas. After January numbers diminished more rapidly in lines 1 to 7 than in lines 9
to 15. This is most simply seen from the total catch in the two sections (table 15). There
were no obvious differences in habitat to account for the differential survival, and the
only way in which treatment had differed was that lines 9 to 15 only had been trapped in
December. It is improbable that this trapping had had any beneficial effects on survival
in lines 9 to 15; moreover, on block F, which was also trapped in December, the rate of
decrease was the fastest of all. These variations in death-rate were not explained by an
unequal distribution of males. In fact, the only difference suggested is that in May 1937
voles may have been rather more crowded on block Â£ than on block Q (see below); but
there was no obvious difference between the two sections of block Q in population density
during the breeding season.
