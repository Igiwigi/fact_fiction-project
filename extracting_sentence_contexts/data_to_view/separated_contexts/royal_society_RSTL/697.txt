Since plati-
num has been known to chemists, different attempts have
been made to produce such a compound, but without effect. On the discovery of fulminating mercury by Mr. HowarD,
he endeavoured to communicate fulminating properties to
compounds of platinum, by means of alcohol, but his trials
were unsuccessful. I have to a certain extent succeeded in
this way, and my attempts have led- to the observation of
some new facts. I have also obtained a new compound of
platinum, analogous in its properties and composition to aurum
Fulminans, and which, in consequence, I shall venture to
designate by the term fulminating platinum. I have, indeed,
already noticed a peculiar compound of platinum under this
name,*
