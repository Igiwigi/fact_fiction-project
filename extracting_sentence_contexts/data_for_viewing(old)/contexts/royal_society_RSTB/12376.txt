e-mail: g.jekely@exeter.ac.uk Throughout the history of cilium research, there have been multiple cases
where findings in one species have proven consequential in a number of dis-
tantly related systems spanning the entire eukaryotic diversity. Comparative
approaches have not only driven molecular discoveries, but also our under-
standing of the static and dynamic aspects of cilia. In fact, we owe much of
our knowledge of basic ciliary biology and motility to Chlamydomonas reinhard-
tii, an easy-to-culture, genetically tractable green alga dubbed the ‘green yeast’
[8]. For instance, the phenomenon of intraflagellar transport (IFT)—the bidirec-
tional transport of proteins inside cilia—was discovered in Chlamydomonas [9].
IFT has since been shown to be present in most ciliated organisms [10,11], and is
critical to build cilia and to control length, ciliary sensing and many signalling
processes [12]. Likewise, key axonemal structures were studied in the first
instance in this green alga [13-15]. The cilium has an irrefutable place in
human health and disease, with ciliary dysfunctions implicated in diverse path-
ologies including Kartagener’s syndrome, loss of male fertility owing to
immotile sperm [16] or polycystic kidney disease [17]. Recent trends towards
increasingly quantitative analysis of motile ciliary dynamics have enabled
