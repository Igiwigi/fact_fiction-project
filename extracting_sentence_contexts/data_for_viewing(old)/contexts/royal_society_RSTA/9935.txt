Tf, then, the constants calculated from three observed lines give a formula which
brings a particular line outside the limits, it is possible to determine whether a
permissible change in the original wave-lengths can bring it within. It is used also
to test the validity of Rypserc’s law as to the limits of 8. and P. A. further valuable
result is that it enables us to give the limits of possible variation of A, p, @, @g., in
the example above cited by putting p= —q=r= +1. The utmost possible, though
unlikely, variations are then +3°18 for A, #°005155 for p, and +°013846 for a.
When in the following pages limits of this kind are given, it will be understood that
they have been arrived at in the above manner.

We shall have to apply certain laws and relationships already known, and it | is
necessary to have some clear idea of the degree of exactness with which they represent
facts. Some of these depend on direct observation, others on relationships arising
from the formule. Of the former the most important relate to the doublet (v) and
triplet (v%, v2) separations of the various series. They are :—

(A) The value of v (or of 4, v,) is the same for all the members of either the
sharp or diffuse series—the separation in the diffuse series being taken
between the satellite of the first and the second, and in the case of triplets
for v, between the satellite of the second and the third.

(B) The values of v for sharp and diffuse are the same.

(C) The value of » for the first line of the principal series is the same as for the
sharp or diffuse.
