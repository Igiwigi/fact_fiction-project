was not there on the preceding night. An infinitesimal residue had crept out of the
stopcocks, or the hydrochloric acid had acted on the cerate employed to render the tube
air-tight.

And here I would allude in passing to an effect which at a future stage of this inquiry
will be found suggestive of the mechanism by which the complex cloud-forms are pro-
duced. I touched the top and bottom of the experimental tube for a moment with my
two fingers; the cloud, which was of exceeding lightness, immediately showed responsive
convection. It was wonderfully sensitive to the slightest local change of temperature.
Once started in this simple way the motions of the cloud went on, and ended in the
development of a splendid cloud-figure.

The influence of a minute residue is also strikingly illustrated by the following fact. 15
inches of mixed hydrochloric acid and air, exposed for fifteen minutes to a powerful beam,
showed not the slightest trace of action. A small pellet of bibulous paper, not half the
8ize of a pea, was moistened with the iodide of allyl. I held the pellet between my
fingers till it became almost dry, then inserted it into a connecting piece, and sent a little
air over it into the experimental tube. On stopping the flow of air a blue cloud began
to form immediately, and in five minutes the rich colour had extended quite through
the experimental tube. This cloud was 3 feet long and discharged a good body of light,
but for s0me minutes it could be completely quenched by the Nicol. At the end of
fifteen minutes a white massive cloud filled the experimental tube. Considering the
amount of matter concerned in the production of this nebula, it seemed like the deve-
lopment of a cloud-world out, of nothing.
