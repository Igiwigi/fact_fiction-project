marsupials are thus not linked with a difference in mitochon-
drial proton leak. The UCP1 gene is present in monotremes
and marsupials but has been shown to be more similar in
sequence to its ectothermic (e.g. actinopterygians and lissam-
phibians) rather than eutherian orthologues, and UCP1, if
expressed at all, is thus unlikely to present a thermogenic
function in those groups [11,76]. Hence, while individual
cases of NST in marsupials have been reported (electronic
supplementary material, Note S2), the exact mechanism
underlying the endothermy of non-eutherian mammals is
currently unknown (figure 1).

In fact, even among eutherians, the activation of UCP1 in
BAT is not the only available strategy to achieve NST. The
ucp1 coding sequence can be found in many other vertebrate
clades, including actinopterygians and amphibians, indicating
that the gene likely appeared very early in the evolution of ver-
tebratesâ€”at least in the last common ancestor of osteichthyans
[9,76]. The function of UCP1 orthologues in ectothermic ver-
tebrates remains an enigma, and it is widely accepted that
UCP1 only acquired thermogenic abilities in the last
common ancestor of the eutherians, through its expression in
BAT [70,76]. Several recent studies on the evolution of the
UCP!1 gene in eutherians, however, have shown that inactivat-
ing mutations have appeared in many large mammalian
