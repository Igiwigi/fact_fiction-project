15-18 minutes) and melanophore expansion is relatively rapid (A. carolinensis, 4 minutes :
A. equestris, 1 minute). There, however, the comparison ends. Caruron found that
excised skin turns green both in the dark and in the light. Moreover, such skin may
be made to assume the brown colour by gentle mechanical stimulation. From this
he reasonably inferred that the state of contraction is the resting condition of the
melanophores. The same conclusion must be drawn from Hap.ey’s work on

A, equestris. Excised skin of this animal placed in physiological salt solution continued
to respond for three hours to weak and strong light by pallor and darkening respectively.
A curious fact upon which Haptery failed to comment was that whereas the response
times of whole animals were as quoted above, the times for excised skin were: green
to brown 30-40 secs., brown to green 12-15 secs. Not only are these times much shorter,
but their relation to each other is reversed. In whole animals melanophore expansion
takes place much more rapidly than contraction, in excised skin contraction is the
more rapid. Still more puzzling are the data on the effect of temperature on the excised
skin of this species, SmrrH (1929). We have already referred to this work as constituting
the only clear evidence for the expansion of reptilian melanophores at low temperatures
under conditions of illumination that promote melanophore contraction. Now if in
this species the proximal position of the pigment is the resting (7.e., relaxed) state of
the melanophore, as must be inferred from the fact that the denervated skin is green
in the absence of photic stimulation, it appears from Smrrx’s data that heat induces
@ state of relaxation, and cold promotes the opposite state (excitation). It is not
