This is not to deny that state-dependence could be experiences to be compared on an equal footing. The prospects
re-established under a more nuanced reading of behavioural for experimentally inducing mind wandering episodes are lim-
states and/or sleep stages. In fact, I think this is exactly ited [37,39,46-49]. Experimental manipulations are available;
the way things will optimally develop [18,20]. Here, I have for example, boring tasks, alcohol or nicotine withdrawal
three main reasons for focusing on a more coarse-grained increase the frequency of mind wandering and decrease task
view of behavioural states.
