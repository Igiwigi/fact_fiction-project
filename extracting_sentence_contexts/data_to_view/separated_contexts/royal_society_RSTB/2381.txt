We shall see that in an important character they differ from all the true
Cyathew, and from Eu-dicksonia. Curist has placed Hypoderris and Woodsia together with Onoclea and Diacalpe
in the Aspidiaceze. This appears to be done chiefly on grounds of external habit,
quite irrespective of the internal arrangements of the sorus, and notwithstanding the
fact that the indusium is basal in the former, while it arises from the tip of the
receptacle in the latter. Observations were made on the sorus of Hypoderris Brownii, J. Sm., and first it
may be noted that the outline of the sorus shows some variety, numerous cases of
fission being found. There is a thin basal indusium, and sporangia of various ages
are mixed together with no apparent order of succession, though the majority of the
young sporangia originate towards the centre.
