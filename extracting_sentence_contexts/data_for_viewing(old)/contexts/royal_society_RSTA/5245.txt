because it assumes the aerosol particles start at their equilibrium size during the activation
process, when in fact they need a finite time to grow to these sizes.

The converse is true for the Fountoukis and Nenes scheme, which overpredicts the number
of activated drops (cf. figures 1a and 3d); however, the Fountoukis and Nenes scheme still
underestimates the albedo because it does not consider the effect of swollen aerosol on the cloud
radiative properties (cf. figures 1b and 3e). This finding has been discussed by Simpson ef al.
[13, §3.3].

In general, though, the albedo changes caused by adding salt particles are significantly
underestimated by both schemes, which is due to the fact that neither of the parametrization
methods treats unactivated aerosol in the calculations of albedo. It is evident that both of
the parametrization schemes were not designed for the range of inputs that are relevant for
geoengineering applications, in which there can be a large quantity of unactivated aerosol
