in the La Chapelle, Gibraltar and Heidelberg erania. The Gibraltar skull is 740 mm.
smaller in the total palatal measurement and 930 mm. in the measurement of the area
in front of the second molar teeth. ‘The hypothetical palate of Heidelberg man most
closely approximates to that of Talgai, but it is smaller by areas of 230 and 430 mm.
in the two estimations. Of the palates of recent races, the Tasmanian figured by
Kerra (9) is larger than any to which I have had access, although several Australian
and New Britain specimens approach it closely. This Tasmanian example is similar
in the estimation of both areas to the reconstructed Heidelberg palate.

A study of the calculations of the palatal areas in the various large specimens
investigated shows very clearly that the disparity in size between the Talgai specimen
and the others is much greater in the area in front of the second molar teeth than in
the total palatal area, This further illustrates the fact that the palate is immature in
the Talgai skull. Indeed it is safe to assume that had the wisdom teeth erupted,
even if comparatively little further development of the jaw had taken place therewith,
the palatal area would have been at least 4000 mm. That the area of the palate
should be so great with diameters not strikingly in excess of many modern palates
is explained by the expanded shape of its anterior portion and the prominence
of the canine teeth. In this very primitive shape, there is a very clear contrast to
the specialised form of very broad, short palate found in Neanderthal man.

A comparison with the hypothetical Piltdown palate is of the utmost interest.
Though no access to any of the actual reconstructions has been possible in this
country, Smrra-Woopwarn’s (11) and Kerrn’s (8) descriptions and figures render
this comparison possible. In shape, and in the prominence of the canine teeth,
