year. The extreme easterly position is assumed in December about 10 p.m., but in
all the other months of the year about 8 to 9 a.m. The hours of maximum and
minimum look later than at Kew, but that is mainly, if not wholly, due to the
difference in local time.

Tn addition to the December minimum, prominent in all the elements, the ranges
and the sum of the differences show, as at Kew, a second inconspicuous minimum at
midsummer. The interval between the two apparent maxima in the ranges is, as at
Kew, longer than that between the two maxima in the sum of the differences, the
latter appearing at both stations in June and August.

The monthly ranges and sums of the differences appear, on the whole, a trifle
smaller than at Kew. This is really attributable to the fact that the mean sun-spot
frequency for the Falmouth period 1891 to 1902 was slightly less than that for the
Kew period 1890 to 1900. During the common period 1892 to 1895, in the mean
diurnal inequality for the year, the Falmouth range was the greater by 0/-10, whilst
the Kew sum of the differences was the greater by 0°57. As these differences
represent only about 1 per cent. of the quantities themselves, the only safe conclusion
is that the amplitudes of the diurnal inequality of declination at Kew and Falmouth
are exceedingly nearly equal,

§ 8. Two maxima and minima are shown from October to April, somewhat
doubtfully in April; in the remaining five months there is at least a retardation in
