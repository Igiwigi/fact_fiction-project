environmental settings, incomplete reference databases and false positive
results due to contamination. We provide a review of the field.

1. Introduction

For over a decade, researchers have exploited the fact that environmental DNA
(eDNA) derives not just from microbes, but from a wide range of organisms,
including plants and vertebrates. A large proportion of the ancient flora and
fauna do not fossilize, but leave extracellular DNA traces in the sediments. In a
pioneering 2003 study, sediments from Siberia and New Zealand were found
to contain traces of DNA from extinct animals, such as the woolly mammoth
and moa birds [1].
