The foregoing reasoning then shows that the coefficient of
H,? («,, #, 2), when we transform v into sphere coordinates, will be

(—1)"=h," (m, 2, ),

in which the = means that every possible integral value of m is to be taken from
0 upwards. In fact, if we put

' pt
u =(i +xan05+ #21 (n+ 5) Qn +3) + é a0

the coefficient of H,? (2, y;, 2,) will become
