The further development proceeds in essential points as in ZL. clavatum, a
would hardly have been necessary to illustrate it by fig. 75, had it not been # a
vascular bundle showed, in the one case figured, a slight extension upwards
the sporangium. I do not, wish to make more of this than the facts warrant,
drawing is a faithful representation of what was seen in this exceptional case,
a matter for remark that these sporangia of Lycopodium, though they are of
siderable size, have no vascular supply; in the whole genus this one case is th
trace I have seen of any extension of the vascular system in the direction :

sporangium. . Tangential sections show that the number of archesporial cells is large;
fig. 76, which is at a phase of development intermediate between those of figs, 62
64 of L. clavatum, shows very beautifully that the number of these is twelve, â€”
limit of the sub-archesporial pad often becomes irregular as the develop
proceeds ; even in an early condition (fig.
