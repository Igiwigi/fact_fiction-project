Although Priestley
opted for the ‘phlogistic hypothesis’, he recognized that it was ‘not without its difficulties’, but he :
insisted that it shared these difficulties with Lavoisier’s theory. Whether in the form of phlogiston :=
or caloric, each theory violated a shared epistemic commitment to a chemistry of ponderable
substances, isolable in the laboratory [28, pp. 203-205]. Priestley valued both hypotheses as
heuristic devices for the generation of new facts in a patient, humble experimental approach to nee)
God's infinite creation. Priestley and other phlogistic chemists faulted Lavoisier not for emphasizing the importance [4
of quantitative analysis, but for narrowing the domain of chemistry to the stoichiometric DNS
determination of the relative quantities of reactants and products in chemical reactions [19, [=
pp- 207-236]. Lavoisier’s conception of the aerial domain was also considerably narrower than DB
Priestley’s doctrine of airs.
