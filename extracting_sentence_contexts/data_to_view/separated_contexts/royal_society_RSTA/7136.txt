The distinction between the cases //c>0, fic <0 is that in the former, g<qy on the ares
forming the cusp, whereas in the latter g> qo; in both cases q> qo on the straight streamline
which prolongs the cusp.

APPENDIX 2. ANALOGIES FOR THE HODOGRAPH THEORY

The key facts of this paper are (i) that the transformation (2-1) has a branch locus which
is characteristic for the hodograph equation, and (i1) that the function ©, defined in (4-19)
has an analytic continuation which is single valued for 0<q<1 and all real ¢. Neither of
these properties is a priori at all evident, so it will be of interest to indicate briefly the con-
siderations leading to the choice of the formulae (2-1) and (4-19) as starting-points. The leading idea is that the attack on the hodograph equation should be guided by the
prior study of simpler but analogous equations.
