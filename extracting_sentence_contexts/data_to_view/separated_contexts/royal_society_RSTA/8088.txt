Moreover,
if the formula (36) were modified to fit e, better, the discrepancy in 7, would not be reduced
but increased, because a more slowly varying outer field induces a less intense inner
field. This indicates that the values (34) for « and g, which accord well with the relation
between the induced and inducing fields in the case of the diurnally periodic variations,

are not consistent with it in the case of the slower, aperiodic, variation in the later stages
of a magnetic storm. While it was natural and proper, in the first instance, when
considering the daily magnetic variations alone, to try to represent the earth by a
uniformly conducting sphere, surrounded by an outer non-conducting layer, it now
appears that this simple model is inconsistent with the observed facts, when both the
daily and the storm-time variations are considered.

5.5. The discrepancy with the simple model (34) is further illustrated by fig. 5, which
refers to a combined field (primary field plus calculated induced field) chosen so as to
fit the observed H.F. variations (dotted lines) fairly well: the corresponding V.F.
variations are much greater than is observed ; this indicates that the calculated ratio
of the induced to the primary field is too small, agreeing with fig. 4.

5.6. The induced field would be increased, as the observations require, if a larger
value were assigned to «; calculations have shown that, with g < 0-96, « must be

increased at least to 44.10~! (7.¢., 12-fold) to fit the storm-time observations : the
smaller the value of q, the larger must be the value of «, for two reasons, namely, because
of the factor q* arising from the variation of the inducing and induced fields across the
non-conducting outer layer, and further, because in the expression for the induced
currents « is associated with a factor g.
