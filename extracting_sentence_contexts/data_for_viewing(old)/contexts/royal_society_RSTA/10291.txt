cogredience is an essential element in the definition of a relation which, with the aid
of axioms, distributes the points in any punctual line into an order.

*20°42. Definition—A Cogredient Point is the class of objective reals cogredient
with some objective real a, together with a itself. The symbol «,, denotes the class

of cogredient points at the instant ¢. The definition in symbols is
oy = u{(qa).aweOn. u = Kau cogrdy,‘a} Df

Note.—In the case of Euclidean geometry, which is the only case considered here,
each cogredient point is a point according to the definition of *3:42. The present
definition would be very inconvenient, unless this were the case. The symbol oy, is
reminiscent of the fact that the cogredient points are the points at infinity.

*20°51. Definition.—The Point-Ordering Relation is a tetradie relation holding
between three points and an instant of time. Its symbol is R,,, and R,,,'(ABC?) is
defined to mean that, at the instant ¢, (1) A, B, C are non-cogredient points upon the
same objective real, a@ say, and (2) there exist an objective real « and three
interpoints u, v, w on x such that (i) # is cogredient with a, and (ii) , », w are in the
interpoint order wow, and (iii) A, B, C are in perspective with the dominant points
