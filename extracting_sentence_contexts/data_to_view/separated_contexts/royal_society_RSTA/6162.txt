In Section S2 of the electronic supplementary material, we provide
more details on the data imputation technique and we present an empirical study to quantify the
impact of data imputation on the results presented in the next section. Figure S2 of the electronic
supplementary material displays the data after imputation. To account for the fact that T repeated observations are available for each subject and process,
we need to slightly modify model (2.3). We do so by assuming that the different time points
are independent of each other, so that repeated observations can be straightforwardly included
in the proposed model. Let Yj denote the count for the ith subject and the jth process at time
t, i=1,...,n,j=1,...,d and t=1,...,T.
