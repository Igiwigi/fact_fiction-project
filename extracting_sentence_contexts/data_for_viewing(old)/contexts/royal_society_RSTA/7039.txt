bands of the K- and L,-spectra, as well as providing an explanation of their very diffuse
tailing-away towards low energies.

A few words may be added with respect to the short wave-length tailing of metal
bands, already illustrated in figure 9 for the case of Mg. We think that probably this
must be ascribed to satellite radiation of the type L,(V) V. A condition for the emission
of a satellite is that the second ionization must remain in the neighbourhood of the
emitting atom while the radiation is actually emitted. In the case of a metal, the
average time taken for a hole in the conduction band to move from one atom to the
next is of the order of 10-! sec. Since the radiation time is at least 10-'-10-"? sec.,
the probability that a hole will have moved away is great. But there is a certain
probability that it will stay during the emission period, and this is increased on account
of the fact that if the hole happens to occur near the bottom of the band, it will move
relatively slowly. We think that this mechanism is sufficient to account for the very
weak short wave-length tails. In the case of insulators, stronger tailing to short wave-
lengths is observed, but this radiation seems to end more or less abruptly, and is almost
certainly genuine radiation belonging to the band itself.

10. BAND WIDTHS AND BAND FORMS

We now give the actual intensity curves of the bands, in figure 12 for metals+ and in
figure 13 for non-metals. In accordance with the theory of § 3 they are plotted in
the form of J(£)/v3 curves. They represent, therefore, probably with reasonable
accuracy, the functions N* ,(E) and N¥(£) for L,- and K-bands respectively. In the
case of L,-bands, the effect of the overlapping of L,-bands has been eliminated. In
