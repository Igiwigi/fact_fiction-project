This experiment I have made, and as
I did not find the muscle to contract, I must hold Mr. VoLTA's
opinion on this point to be likewise ill founded. The fact js,
that as far as the contraction of muscles is a test, whether the
influence exists or not, and we have no other, it is never ex-
d cited, when two 'metals, or one metal and charcoal are neces-
sary for this purpose, unless these substances touch each other,
and are also in contact with some of the fluids formerly men-
tioned. But there is still another requisite for the excitement of the
influence, which is a communication, by means of some good
Â© conductor of electricity, between the two quantities of fluid,
to which the dry exciters are applied, beside that which takes
place between the same quantities of fluid, when the dry ex-
citers are brought into contact with each other. As from this
last circumstance, a complete circle of connection is formed
among the different substances employed, it has been imagined
by many, that the individual quantity of the influence excited
goes the whole round, each time contraction is produced.
