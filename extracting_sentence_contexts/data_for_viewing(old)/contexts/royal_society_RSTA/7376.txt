showed, however, in a similar problem (1904) that the general form of resultant disturbance
at a point of the surface is the same in the two cases, the main differences lying in the different
law of decrease of amplitude with distance, and in the cutting off of the infinite tails which
appear in the two-dimensional case. The essential features of our solution may consequently
be expected to appear in the three-dimensional problem.

Explanations may therefore be suggested for two apparent anomalies in earthquake
records: (a) seismograms of near earthquakes sometimes show Sg as having arrived 1 to 2sec.
before the time at which it would be expected after Pg (Jeffreys 1929, p. 98), and also (6) ‘up
to about 20°, the S' residuals are spread over about 20sec. without any convincing con-
centration of frequency’ (Jeffreys 1946, p. 61). Here Sg, Pg and S have their usual meanings

in seismology. In view of these facts it is worth while to examine in further detail the form
of our S'and pS, in order to find out how long before the instant ¢ = ,/(x? 4-H?) /# the disturb-
ance might become perceptible.

The question cannot be answered directly from our previous discussion, since our sim-
plifying assumption of an instantaneous shock at the focus leads to an infinite displacement
at the time of arrival of a jerk at G. Let us therefore modify our assumption of time variation
as H(t) to time variation as
