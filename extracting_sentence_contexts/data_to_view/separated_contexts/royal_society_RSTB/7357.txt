In this present work a detailed histological description of the life history of epithelium,
basement membrane and capillary bed is given, and the limits of the basement membrane
and the structure and extent of the capillary bed have been defined as accurately as possible. The resulting picture of lung structure was encouragingly self-consistent and contained
significant features which pointed unmistakably in the same direction. Nevertheless, many
obscurities remained, due largely to ignorance concerning the facts of lung growth as
a whole. This aspect has been studied and has corroborated and amplified understanding
of the results from histological investigation. The evidence from both sources favours the
view that alveolar epithelium does not exist in at least one adult mammalian species.
