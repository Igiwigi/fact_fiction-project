only a part of that plate and was never related to a fin, and that on the mid dorsal
ridge of the body there were two enlarged scales or “stachel-artige Bildungen” which
may have been associated with dorsal fins. In Rhamphodopsis the median dorsal

clasps the root of a spine which stands up dorsally and is comparable with a fin
spine.

Thus it is not impossible that the ancestral Arthrodeirs may have possessed Acan-
thodian-like fins, with anterior spines. Confirmatory evidence may be afforded by the
fact that in Pterychthiodes, which StENsto has shown to be related to the Arthrodeirs,
the single dorsal fin has its anterior edge surrounded by a spine which is exactly
similar to a fin spine of Brachyacanthus. The idea held by TRagQuair that this spine was
composed of more than one element seems to be erroneous. It is difficult to carry the
comparison much further because of the incompleteness of our knowledge, but it may
be pointed out that the lateral-line system of the head of Diplacanthus is in some ways
very reminiscent of that of Arthrodeirs.

In general body form the Arthrodeirs with their macruriform appearance do not
recall Acanthodians, the row of ridge scales along the dorsal border of the tail of
Rhamphodopsis, and the character of the squamation of Lunaspis are definite points of
difference. It is none the less reasonable to suggest that the two groups possess the same
grade of structure and may legitimately be grouped as ‘“‘Aphetohyoidea”. Such
