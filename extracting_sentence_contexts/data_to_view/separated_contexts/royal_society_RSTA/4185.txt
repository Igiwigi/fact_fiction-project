The electrolyte chosen for investigation
was sodium hydroxide, which has the advantage, not possessed by many binary salts,
of being exceedingly soluble in water, so that even at 0° C. it is possible to measure
the properties of a 50-per cent. solution, though at this temperature such a solution
is highly supersaturated. In common with others who have been engaged in the
study of concentrated aqueous solutions, we have been impressed with the fact that
combination between solvent and solute is an essential part of the process of solution,
and that the presence of hydrates must be recognised not only in the crystals which
separate when the solutions are cooled, but also in the solutions themselves. We
have not, however, been able to reconcile our observations with the view, in itself
improbable, that this power of combination is no longer operative in dilute solutions,
and indeed have obtained evidence that if the reduction in volume which frequently
accompanies dissolution may be regarded as an index of the association of solvent and
solute, the degree of association reaches a maximum only at dilutions which are not
far removed from those required for complete ionisation. We believe, therefore, that
