THEORY OF AXISYMMETRIC TURBULENCE 577

The vanishing of the trace of §,;, which was assumed in § 9 (equation (127)), follows from

the fact that in any homogeneous turbulence 7;, must vanish at the origin and that, therefore,
[Sil--0 = 2LPil-=05 (149)
and that this last vanishes, follows directly from the representation of P, in terms of a.

It is worthy of notice here that according to the formulae we have given for the defining
scalars of S;; (cf. equations (122))

(Si)-=0 = 00 =—2(D,@),=9 and (Sy),-9 = So) = + 6(D,%),-0- (150)

11. CoNcLUDING REMARKS

The developments of the preceding sections bring the formal theory of axisymmetric
turbulence to the same degree of completeness that von Karman, Howarth and Robertson
