accordance with the theoretical law of Frequency of Error, and this form of distribution
is caused in the case of the patterns entirely by internal conditions, and in no way by
natural selection in the ordinary sense of that term. It is impossible not to recognise the fact so clearly illustrated by these patterns in
the thumbs, that natural selection has no monopoly of influence in forming genera,
but that it could be wholly dispensed with, the internal conditions acting by them-
selves being amply sufficient to form them. When the internal conditions are in
harmony with the external ones, as they appear to be in all long-established races,
their joint effects will curb individual variability more tightly than either would do
by itself. The normal character of the distribution about the typical centre will not
be thereby interfered with.
