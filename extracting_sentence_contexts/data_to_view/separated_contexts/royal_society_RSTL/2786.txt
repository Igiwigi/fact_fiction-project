The young
Spaniel, on the contrary, looked on with indifference ; but it pursued the first Wood-
cock which it ever saw with joy and exultation, of which its companion, the Terrier,
did not in any degree partake. T had at that period made a great many analogous experiments, and I have subse-
quently made a considerable number, chiefly upon one variety of dog, namely, that
which is generally used in search of Woodcocks, and is usually called the Springing
Spaniel. 'These experiments were commenced nearly sixty years ago, and occupied a
good deal of my attention during more than twenty years, and to a less extent nearly
to the present time; and as it does not appear to me probable that any person is now
likely to investigate this subject as laboriously, or through 80 long a period, I have
been induced to believe that the facts which I am prepared to communicate may be
thought to deserve to be recorded in the Transactions of this Society. ;

At the period in which my experiments commenced, well-bred and well-taught
Springing Spaniels were abundant, and I readily obtained possession of as many as I
wanted. TI had at first no other object in view than that of obtaining dogs of great
excellence; but within a very short time some facts came under my observation
which very strongly arrested my attention. In several instances young and wholly
inexperienced dogs appeared yery nearly as expert in finding Woodcocks as their ex-

untaught animals ; and I had the satisfaction, in more than one instance, to 8ee some
of those find as many Woodcocks, and give tongue as correctly, as the best of my
older dogs.
