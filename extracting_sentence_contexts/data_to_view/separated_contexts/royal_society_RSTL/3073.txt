xi. + It follows from this fact, that massive carbonate of lime, in which the axes of the molecules have
every possible direction, should neither expand nor contract by heat, and would therefore form an
invariable pendulum. As there must be, in any given length of massive carbonate of lime, as many
expanding as there are contracting axes, then, if the contractions and expansions in each individual
erystal are equal, they will destroy one another ; but if they are proportional to their lengths, the con-
tractions will exceed the dilatations. In this case, we have only to combine the marble with an ordi-
nary expanding substance, to haye an invariable pendulum.
