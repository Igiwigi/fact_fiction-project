[8], there is a need to consider both approaches working together: many phenomena are best
explained if both processes are tightly coupled. An easy way to see this is to use the TP mechanism
to give rise to the spontaneous symmetry-breaking by which a gradient will form, and this
gradient can then be interpreted by a mechanism that embodies the hallmarks of the PI model.

Here, however, we are interested in the mathematical nature of the models involved in
generating TPs or PI. Historically, PI has often not been explicit about mechanistic models,
often resorting to purely verbal models [2]. There are also, compared to the TP case [11,22,23],
few studies investigating design principles of PI mechanisms. One important study of stripe
formation [52] found a set of network architectures capable of producing stripes. One
fundamental question that has so far received only limited attention is whether the networks
capable of producing TPs are fundamentally distinct from those capable of producing PI patterns;
or if they are in fact related.

At the level of network structure—which by itself does not suffice to constrain the system
dynamics [53]—there appears to be some overlap in the motifs found in different contexts [11,52].
A more thorough analysis of different detailed mechanistic models [54], however, suggests that
there are indeed considerable similarities between models producing TPs and models embodying
PI. Indeed, we can represent models as labelled simplicial complexes by including all model
