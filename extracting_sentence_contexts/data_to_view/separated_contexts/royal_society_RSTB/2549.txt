K6rnriker described, in 1864,
the striped appearance of the fibres in the transverse section of an Astrea, which he

without making a closer investigation of the subject.

The “cross-lines” seen in transverse section represent actual lamella. This is
proved by the fact that the fibres are crossed by similar wavy lines in sections cut
longitudinally. Tangential longitudinal sections show them best, in radial longitudinal
