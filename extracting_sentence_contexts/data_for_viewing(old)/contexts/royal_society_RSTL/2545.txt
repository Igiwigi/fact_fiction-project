nearer the truth than my forty or fifty nights' observations taken at different periods.

From the above short table it will appear that in my obseryations for four years,
the maximum oscillation was between 9—10 a.m. and 4—5 p.m. ; the next greatest
was that between 4—5 p.m. and 10—11 P.m., amounting to a little more than 754
per cent. of the preceding fall : then follows the rising tide between 4—5 a.m. and
9—10 4.v., amounting to nearly 40 per cent. of the diurnal tide ; and finally comes
the falling tide between 10—11 p.m. and 4—5 a.m., which by the few direct obserya-
tions I made would not be more than 154 per cent. of the great tide, but which by
the process above noticed, I suppose would be about 38 per cent. ; and this would
accord tolerably well with Mr. Prixsze's proportion, which is nearly 282 per cent.
I shall not remark upon the discrepancies between the ratio thus eliminated, and that
deducible from the obseryations of the other gentlemen quoted in the Table. One fact,
however, appears established by all the observers, that the greatest oscillation is du-
ring the day, the least during the night ; the second greatest from 4—5 to 10—11 p.M.,
and the second least from 4—5 to 9—10 A.v.; and that all the irregularities occur
within comparatively narrow limit hours.

My barometrical observations were taken on various levels, excepting for the yearly
residence of five or six months at Poona during the monsoon, and for the entire year
1830 : the statements of the absolute height of the barometer and the annual and
monthly changes of pressure of the atmosphere will therefore be comparatively limited;
and it may he as well to confine my remarks almost entirely to the year 1830. The
maximum height of the barometer, and the mean monthly maximum in that year,
both occurred in January, the former being 28242 inches, thermometer 73*6, and the
