Consequently
it is not easy to fish out and transfer the floating lumps intact, unless a spoon or
similar instrument is employed. When dried, whether in air or over sulphuric acid
in vacuo, or in absolute alcohol, the volume diminishes considerably, and the shrunken
pieces become opaque and lustreless, and often acquire a yellow tinge; they also
become more brittle or more horny, according to circumstances. In other cases, when in the stages of early development in the fermenting vessels,
the lumps are softer and more viscous than when fully formed; and, in fact, every
transitional stage can be met with from the condition of a slimy, semi-fluid, soft jelly,
to that of a hard horny mass which breaks like glue or cartilage. These physical characteristics are dependent on the amount of water present
in the lumps. Obviously the specific gravity of the fresh pieces will vary according to the amount
of water present, also: I have not examined this point in much detail, but the
following facts may be noted.
