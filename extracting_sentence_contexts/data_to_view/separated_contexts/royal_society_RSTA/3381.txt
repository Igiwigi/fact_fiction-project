In [18], both
entropies were considered, but only for two specific site-basis vectors, the NÃ©el state and the
domain wall state. Here, we average the results over 50 different site-basis vectors and also over
20 realizations of random border defects, so the curves are smoother. The fact that both entropies lead to very similar behaviours suggests that any of the two can
be equivalently used to study non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. In this context, entanglement Dos
does not appear to be an essential property [67,75]. The advantage of the Shannon entropy is to =
be computationally less expensive, because it does not require the partial trace of the system.
