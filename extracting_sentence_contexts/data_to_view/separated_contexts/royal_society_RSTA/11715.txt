taps in turn, in order to remove any air displaced by the mercury. The filling was
then completed and the gauge tubes connected. The absence of air was shown by
the fact that, if the level on one side were disturbed by running mercury into or out
of the gauge, by means of the three-way taps g, *, and mereury reservoirs ¢, af
(fig. 4) provided for the purpose, an equal change of level was almost immediately
apparent on the other side of the gauge. If the level was raised about 1 cm. by

inserting a glass plunger, without withdrawing or adding mercury, the levels returned
to their previous values within 0°01 mm. in about a minute after the removal of the
plunger, in spite of the great length of fine tube through which the mercury had to
flow. If, on the other hand, the continuity of the mercury column was broken by a
single air bubble in one of the fine tubes, the level could be altered by a centimetre
or more on one side without any change taking place on the other.
