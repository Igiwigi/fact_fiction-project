The liquid thus prepared was introduced into five thick glass tubes, which were herme-
tically sealed, placed in a cold oil-bath, gradually heated to 230*, and maintained at
that temperature for a quarter of an hour. The tubes being remoyed and permitted
to cool, the infusion was introduced into a chamber of six tubes, and boiled there for
five minutes.

The superheating of the infusion did not even retard the development of life, for in
less than two days every tube in the chamber swarmed with Bacteria. Thus far, then,
every attempt at a solution was defeated.

But why, it may be asked, attempt such solutions? Was it mere prejudice against
the doctrine of spontaneous generation that prevented me from frankly submitting to
the apparent logic of facts, and admitting the experiments just recorded to be a demon-
stration of the doctrine? By no means. The only prejudice I feel is the wholesome
repugnance to accepting momentous conclusions on insufficient grounds. HuxE's
celebrated argument has its application here. Taking antecedent experience fully
into account, it was easier for me to believe my knowledge imperfect, or my present,
work erroneous, than to believe the doctrine of spontaneous generation true.

$ 11. New Experiments on Animal Infusions. Contradictory results.

In the course of this inquiry I was continually reminded of last year's experiments,
when the most complete immunity from Bacterial or fungoid life was s0 readily secured.
I had operated many times with turnip, never finding the least difficulty as to its steriliza-
tion. It is certain that the care bestowed in preparing the turnip-infusion on the 20th
