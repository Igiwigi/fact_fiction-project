14, Phenomena relating to the Departure from a Linear Relation between the
Pressure and Displacement.

The photograph showing the most marked departure from the linear relation is
D 19, taken at 25 atmospheres pressure, and its measurement by different observers
is given in Table V., which also contains the readings obtained from three other
plates, D18, D24, D25, taken at the same pressure. The last three agree well, and
their mean values have been placed in the last columns of the table, where they may
be compared with the mean values for Plate D19, given in the preceding column.

The table shows that the difference between the two plates is not to be explained
by errors of measurement, and the fact that the discrepancy is different for different
lines would in itself indicate that thereâ€œhad been no accidental disturbance of the
camera, but we have additional evidence of this, because the two exposures of the
comparison spectrum, which were taken before and after the pressure spectrum, are
exactly superposed. An irregularity in the magnitude of the displacements might be
introduced by the unlikely, but still possible, contingency of an alteration in the
temperature, and therefore of the dispersive power, of the grating, during the
exposure of the pressure spectrum, and a return to its original value for the second
half of the divided exposure, but this irregularity would be progressive and should
not displace the lines of one group more than those of another group when the
members of the two are interspersed. There is strong evidence in favour of this
phenomenon being a genuine one.
