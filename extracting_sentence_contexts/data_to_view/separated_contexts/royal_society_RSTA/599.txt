The reason is that in the subatomic quantum
domain patterns (both as spatial and temporal entities) cannot always be defined or identified. This, in turn, is related to fundamental and exclusive properties of quantum systems. At this point it seem opportune to present the following experiment-based ‘quantum facts in a
nutshell’.!! Given a single quantum system that has been physically prepared in a certain way, it
is impossible in principle to determine or verify its particular state by a single measurement. Having
many similar quantum systems prepared in identical ways and subjecting each one to identical
measurements, one will obtain a collection of measurement values from among a common (often
discrete) set that only depends on the instrument and how it is used,!? called the eigenvalues of the
observable in question (the observable itself also being defined by the instrument!%).
