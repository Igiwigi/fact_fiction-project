(2) After the observations without clamping“had been discontinued in November
1930, and the normal procedure of keeping the lever clamped between observations
had been resumed, it was found that the balanced position of the lever was subject
to a daily rate very much in exe

ss of anything we had previously experienced, This
rate was now of the order of 10 minutes per diem, and in the direction of requiring that
the fibre should be more twisted to bring the lever to the sighted position. It was not
until February 1931, that the rate again became normal and approximately steady,
the sextant reading now being about 6° lower than its value in November 1930. We
fear that this phenomenon may be due to slight slipping at the soldered joints between
the quartz fibre and the lever, or between the quartz fibre and the end points to which
it is attached. In support of this we have the following facts. In July and August
1927, observations were made for a period of about 3 weeks during which time the lever
was unclamped. On resuming the clamping at the end of the period and continuing
daily observation, no change in the daily rate took place. Between 1927 and 1930 the
balance had, however, been dismantled for the purpose of tracing faulty joints which
were causing air leakage into the instrument, and it occurred to us that the observed
fall in sextant reading noted above might possibly be due to strains in the metal work
suddenly becoming relieved. The internal framework carrying the thread is made of
brass and is enclosed in a copper tube to which it is rigidly connected at one end, the
other end being fastened by securely driven brass wedges. As the metals involved
have different rates of thermal expansion, there seems a possibility that. firstly, the
whole structure might become distorted with change of temperature causing minor
irregularities in the observations, and secondly, that actual slipping at the wedges
