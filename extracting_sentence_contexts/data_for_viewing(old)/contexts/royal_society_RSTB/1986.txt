or tuberous nature of the gametophyte. This difference is rather comparable to such
an adaptive character as the succulence of some xerophytes, and the origin of the
definite adaptation in some species of Gymnogramme may be looked for with proba-
bility in the capacity which other fern prothalli show of reacting to dry conditions
in a similar way.

Tue Beartnc or APpoGAMY ON THE ORIGIN OF ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS IN
ARCHEGONIATE PLANTS.

It was stated ut the commencement that facts of the kind described and discussed
above derive their chief interest from their possible bearing on the nature of alterna-
tion of generations in the Archegoniate. This will now be considered. Although it
is not the purpose of this paper to enter into a full discussion of the problem of
alternation, it is impossible to avoid its general consideration in any attempt to
estimate the weight to be attached to the evidence afforded by deviations from the
normal life-history, such as the phenomena of apogamy and apospory. The different
assumptions which have been made in discussing the question necessitate this: the
general problem will however be dealt with only so far as to define the author's
position on some points on which a clear understanding is necessary, although in the
present state of our knowledge they must be regarded as working assumptions

â€œmerely. The views entertained with regard to some of these questions profoundly
