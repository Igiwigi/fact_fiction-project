However, Although we have pointed to several reasons to expect
ultimately, the purpose of TED is to explicitly formalize DRA in TED, there are also TED effects that counteract
all aspects of the macroevolutionary process, including the DRA. In particular, when morphological evolution can be

although it is quite possible that DRA is a common problem
in TED [6], each case is potentially unique and warrants a
fresh look before any definite conclusions are drawn.

(c) Dating the placental radiation

We find it encouraging that the total-evidence analysis pre-
sented here produces divergence time estimates that match
the fossil record closely despite the fact that we did not use
any direct constraints on node dates. The explosive radiation
scenario favoured by O'Leary et al. [8,14] places the placental
origin just after the K-Pg mass extinction at 66 Ma. It
requires both net diversification rates and rates of molecular
evolution during the early phases of placental evolution
that are unlikely considering other sources of evidence on
mammalian evolution [13].
