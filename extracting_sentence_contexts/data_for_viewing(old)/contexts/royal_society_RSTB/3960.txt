investigation to be parts of one and the same specimen.* We propose to name the
Kentucky species, Calamopitys americant.

It will be seen from the footnote that the dimensions of the pith vary greatly. In
the rough measurements given the primary wood is included in the pith, as it is
impossible, in many cases, to trace the limits between the two. In fact, as we
shall see, there is reason to believe that we have here to do with a “ mixed” pith.

A general idea of the transverse section is given in Plate 30, Phot. 2, from
a specimen with a small pith, about 4 by 2 mm. in diameter. In such stems the
form of the pith is affected by the emission of the successive leaf-traces, its major
axis coinciding with the direction of the outgoing trace, as shown in the photograph,
The central tissue of the pith is surrounded by a zone of primary xylem, and this
again by the broad secondary wood.

Primary Structure.—The primary xylem zone is shown, by the comparison of

numerous sections, to be nearly, but not quite continuous, the xylem-strands being
