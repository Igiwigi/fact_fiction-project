mitting it,

But, it may be objected, in the instances of iron or manganese,
oxygen is combined with a combustible body, and retained in it
by a decided and powerful affinity. There is no reason to suppose


of a metallic Substance called Palladium. 311

that such an affinity may not exist among metals. We have
been forced to acknowledge it, in a few cases, among the earths ;
and, from the profound and sagacious researches of Mr. BEr-
THOLLET, We have learned many new facts, that promise us a
rapid increase of knowledge. I $hall beg leave to add a few
examples, which are taken from that class of bodies to which the
subject of the present Paper belongs, and show that the metals
obey the general law of mutual attraction.

EXPERIMENTS TO PROVE AFFINITY AMONG THE METALS.

Exper. 1. I dissolved one hundred grains of silver in nitric
acid, and precipitated by neutral muriate of platina. The preci-
pitate, well washed and dried, was of a bright straw-colour, and
weighed 147 grs. Reduced in a charcoal crucible, it yielded a
button weighing 121 grs. and of the specific gravity of 11,6. The
