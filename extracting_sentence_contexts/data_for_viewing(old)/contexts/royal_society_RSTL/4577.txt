tributes to the domestic comforts and commercial greatness of the country, and from
its cheapness, strength and power of being moulded, rolled and forged into almost
every sbape, it is not only the strongest, but in many respects the most eligible mate-
rial for the construction of vessels exposed to severe strain. Large vessels composed
of iron plates, such as steam-boilers, cisterns, ships, &c., cannot however be formed
upon the anvil or the rolling-mill. They are constructed of many pieces, and these
pieces have to be joined together in such a manner as to ensure the requisite strength
and effect, all the requirements of sound construction. This operation is called rivet-
ing, and although practically understood, it has not, to my knowledge, on any previous
occasion, received that attention which the importance of the subject demands.

Up to the present time* nothing of consequence has been done to improve or
enhance the value of this process. We possess no facts or experiments calculated to
establisb principles sufficient to guide our operations in effecting constructions of this
kind, on which the lives of the public as well as the property of individuals depend.
In fact, such has been our ignorance of the relative strength of plates and their
riveted joints, that until the commencement of the present inquiry the subject was
considered of scarcely sufficient importance to merit attention. Eyen now, it is by
many assumed that a well-riveted joint is stronger than the plate itself, and a number
of persons, judging from appearances alone, concur in that opinion, Now this is a
great mistake, and although the double thickness of the joint indicates increased
strength, it is nevertheless much weaker than the solid plate, a circumstance of some
importance, as we hope to show in the following experiments.

It would probably be superfluous to offer any lengthened description of the prin-
