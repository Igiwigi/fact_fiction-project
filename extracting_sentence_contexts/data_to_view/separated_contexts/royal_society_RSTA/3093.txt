It should be noted that the first of the intervals of 13°5 years occurred previous
to 1649, and is not brought into the calculation of the periodogram, which shows
a decided maximum (fig. 1) for a period of 13°5 years. This period has evidently
been one of the characteristic ones during the time to which curve B (fig. 2) applies. The fact that the maxima 1870°6 to 1883°9 are connected with it shows that it has
still been active till quite lately. If it does not appear in curve A (fig. 2), this is
accounted for by the fact that the first diffraction band of the 11 years’ period overlaps
and neutralises it. When the large period is eliminated, a rise at about 13 years
becomes apparent.
