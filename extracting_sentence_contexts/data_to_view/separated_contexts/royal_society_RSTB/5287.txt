From the foregoing summary it will be seen that within the group the aphlebia traces
exhibit a wide variation as to source of origin, ranging from stem to ultimate pinnule
traces, and from general to localised distribution. Both source of origin and type of
distribution serve to render any attempt to determine their homologies peculiarly diffi-
cult, if not impossible. In the present state of our knowledge it seems soundest to
record the facts, and to defer interpretation until these facts are more numerous and
capable of closer co-ordination. Affinities â€”Ankyropteris corrugata exhibits obvious affinities with the remaining plants
comprising the zygopterid alliance, sharing with them the stem stele, differentiated
into peripheral and central regions, and the monodesmic bipolar petiole trace, with its
characteristic type of symmetry and its protostelic method of departure. Within
that alliance the correctness of its assignation to the genus Ankyropteris is, I think,
undoubted.
