Wu argues that
this commitment to a prima facie ‘pointless step’ in the proces-
sing places an explanatory burden on CH. If this were
correct, it would be true that P(OH|D) > P(CH|D). But, in
fact, the interpretations predicted by CH and OH involve the
same decay of information: the decay of information between
visual processing and the lower-capacity processes of cognitive
access. Similarly, Block criticizes the idea that subjects are con-
scious only of non-detailed information about items outside
the focus of attention, on the grounds that inattention does
not make early visual responses less precise [17,31]. But CH

and OH both predict that the loss of detailed information
occurs at the stage of cognitive access, not in early vision.
