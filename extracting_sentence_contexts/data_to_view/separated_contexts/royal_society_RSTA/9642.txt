This line produced backwards intersects
the axis of range of stress. As the ordinate is zero at the intersection, the hysteresis
loop must disappear, or, in other words, the specimen must be completely elastic. The actual prediction was complicated by the fact that the hysteresis loop did not
always attain a constant width for the range. In such cases the width of loop was
taken immediately after the preliminary change in “ cyclical permanent set,” shown
most clearly in the upper curve of fig. 1. ‘
” afforded a check on the result,

In most cases the “rate of permanent extension
as the prediction could be made by substituting this
permanent set” and using the same method of extrapolation. Even with the greatest care the uncertainty of the correction to be applied was
too great to allow of much extrapolation, and the earliest results were always obtained
as close to the limiting conditions as possible.
