and TCK 225/5 Papers of GPO engineer J.E. Taylor: Rough handwritten drafts of articles and jottings relating to J.E. Taylor’s
research. Topics covered are the theories of the electric current, theories of Maxwell, Heaviside, Einstein, Poynting, Faraday,
electromagnetic theories, radiational theories, the propagation of electric waves, wave guidance and metallic conduction,

1880s were, in fact, electromagnetic rather than new systems of electrical telegraphy as he had
understood them at the time [1]. These experiments and the wider research programme and
experimental practice of the GPO in the 1880s and 1890s demonstrated a state institution which
could be both innovative in its engineering practice and deeply resistant to change. The latter
was also further emphasized by the GPO’s lack of engagement with OH’s theoretical work, in
particular the ‘Heaviside Layer’, until it was experimentally proved in the mid-1920s.
