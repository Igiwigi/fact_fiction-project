F — $A* sin doe’ sin() — 4). F=0. ..- ~~ (9)

Now the solution of the problem of the single infinitely thin semi-infinite plane, deduced
by making «a very small, is obtained from (9) by omitting the third term and the last
two terms upon the left-hand side of that equation. It is, in fact, a first approximation
to the solution which is being sought. The expansion of F which is, accordingly,
suggested is one in ascending powers of cos }(4 — o). Let us write, momentarily, ;

P = cos" $(b — bo) = wv", say;
we have then

ap _ ;

aP _ n-2

aye = 4n( )e alt’

P cos (4 — ¥o) = 2u"** — u",

so P sin (Y — bo) = ne" + npr?
