The very complete co-ordination of the spines implied by these facts is,
however, rendered still more conspicuous by experiments in stimulation ; for if, while
an Fehinus is walking on the table in the manner just alluded to, a scrape with a
scalpel, a drop of spirit, a lighted match, or any other severe stimulus be applied at
ome one part of the animal's exterior, the spines all over the surface begin to take on
an active bristling movement, and the direction of advance is immediately changed
into a straight line of escape from the source of injury, And, were it necessary, other
experiments could be detailed to show that the multitudinons spines of an Echinus
are as closely co-ordinated in their action as 80 many limbs. To this account of the
physiology of the spines ib may be added that the nervous plexus overlying the
tubercles on which they are mounted is more sensitive to stimulation than any other
part of the external plexus. This is shown by the fact that, if the tubercle is stimu-
lated by eneclosing the spine in the tube of a pipette, and pressing the tubercle with
the glass edges of the latter, more activity and a greater extent of irradiation of the
stimulus among the spines and pedicellarize is observed, than when any other part of
the surface is similarly stimulated. 4, DgTAILED FACTS OF STIMULATION. —At the commencement of this gection it
has already been stated, as a general fact, thab when two points of the surface of an
Echinoderm are irritated, the direction of advance which results from their joint
influence is usually the diagonal between the two; also that, * when a greater number
of points are irritated, the direction of advance becomes uncertain ;” and lastly, that
*if any, even s8hort interval of time is allowed to elapse between the application of
8uccessive stimuli to different parts of the surface, the direction of adyance will be in
a straight line away from the stimulus applied latest.”
