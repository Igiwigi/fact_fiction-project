is assumed that the points of the circle are all of them equidistant from the centre, and
by this assumption we are enabled to compare distances upon different lines. In fact

given point A draw a finite line equal to a given finite line BC, and thence also upon
a given line through A, determine the finite line AD equal to the given finite line BC.
