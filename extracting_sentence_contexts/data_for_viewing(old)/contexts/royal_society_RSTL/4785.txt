Tf this be the correct representation, it follows that verantine and rubiretine stand
in an intimate relation to one another, that the formation of one always indicates
that of the other. In confirmation of this view, I may state that I haye neyer seen
the formation of one of these substances taking place without it being possible to
detect the presence of the other.

Rubianine.â€”This substance, as I mentioned before, has not hitherto been observed
among the bodies derived from madder. It greatly resembles rubiacine in its appear-
ance and many of its properties; it may however easily be distinguished by sevyeral
characteristics, and above all by its composition. It is obtained from a solution in
boiling alcohol in the form of bright lemon-yellow, silky needles, which, when dry,
form an interwoven mass. It is soluble in boiling water, more $0 in fact than any of
the products of decomposition hitherto mentioned. It crystallizes out again on the
s0lution cooling in yellow silky needles. It is less soluble in alcobol than the pre-
ceding substances. Its colour is lighter than that of rubiacine. When heated on pla-
tinum-foil it melts to a brown liquid, then burns, leaving a carbonaceous residue,

which on further heating disappears entirely. When heated in a glass tube it gives a
small quantity of a yellow crystalline sublimate, but not by far s large a quantity as
is obtained under the same cireumstances from rubiacine, which, when carefully
heated, may be almost entirely volatilized. It is soluble in concentrated sulphuric
