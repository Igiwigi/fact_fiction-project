On @ new and powerful Generator of Dynamic Flectricity. Q 55. The fact that a large amount of magnetisxm can be developed in an electro-magnet

by means of a permanent magnet of much smaller power having been established, and as
Zfrom the first series of experiments (Table I.) it was shown that definite quantities of
=magnetism are accompanied by the evolution of proportionate quantities of dynamic
Selectricity, and smnce an electro-magnet, when excited by means of a voltaic battery,
=Spossesscs all the properties of a permanent magnet, it appeared reasonable to suppose
Sthat a large electro-magnet excited by means of a Â«mall magneto-eclectric machine could,
i= :Sby switable arrangements, be made instrumental in evolving a proportionately large
i = quantity of dynamic electricity, notwithstanding the pulsatory character of the electricity
7 or through the wires surrounding the electro-magnet.

56. Two magnet-cylinders, of similar construction to the one already described (9)

5 * Since the publication of the abstract of this paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, my attention
= has been directed to several accounts of experiments in which electro-magnets, excited by means of magneto-

S electric machines, have been made to sustain considerable w eights. The most important of these accounts
Soohich have come under my notice, is one contained in Sruxmaras's Journal of Science for 1845, vol. xIviii. p. 39:3,
