Lastly, when dissolved isinglass was added to the yellow
Solution of indigo, it immediately became very turbid, and a
bright yellow substance was gradually deposited; and 'coated
the sides of the glass jar with a-touglh elastic film, which was
insoluble-/in boiling- water, and possessed the” characters of
gelatine combined with tanning matter.

By this experiment I therefore ascertained; that a variety
of the artificial tanning substance could be formed without
previously converting the vegetable/body into'coal ; and I have
since discovered, that although indigo more readily yields this
substance than most of the other vegetable bodies, yet in fact,
very few of these can: be regarded as-exceptions, when 'sub-=
Jected to repeated digestion and distillation with nitric acid;

2.—A. In my former Paper I have stated, that common
resin, when treated with-nitric acid, yielded-a pale yellow $0-
lution with water, which did not-precipitate- gelatine; and that
it was requisite-to develope part of the carbon [in the; state-of
coal by sulphuric acid, before any of-the-tanning substance
could. be. produced;  but-having again made-some- of these
experiments, I repeated- the 'abstraction- of nitric acid several
times, and then observed, that the solution' of resin in water
acted upon gelatine similar to-the-s0lution of indigo which has
