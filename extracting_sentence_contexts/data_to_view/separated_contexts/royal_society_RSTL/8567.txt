Criticigms have appeared in several papers questioning the applicability of the
bathometer for determining the depth of the sea, owing to the disturbance of the sea-
level by continental attraction. This cause of disturbance had not escaped my attention
in writing my paper*; and it should be borne in mind that the instrument cannot do
more than indicate comparatively small variations in total terrestrial attraction, which
the hydrographer or navigator using the bathometer will have to interpret according to
the cireumstances of the case. The zero-point of the instrument must yary no doubt
with latitude, continental attraction, and also in consequence of special geological
causes; but it is important to observe that these causes are of a permanent character,
and that if an ocean has been once suryeyed with the aid of the bathometer, such
special local conditions would become obseryed facts, and s0 far from hindering the
