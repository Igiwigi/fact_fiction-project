We do not use separate notation for the true mean first passage time and this estimator of it. In
describing the transition dynamics in terms of a Markov chain in figure 5, we rely on standard
assumptions of the AMS algorithm, stated by Cérou eft al. [8, p. 12].

The time T.45 + Ts.4 is the mean non-reactive time. This is the mean time for trajectories starting
from within A to return to A, conditioned on the fact that they reach S. Similarly, Tas +Tsp is
the mean reactive time for trajectories starting from within A to reach B, conditioned on the fact
that they do not return to A. Neither the reactive time nor the non-reactive time is particularly
large. What makes the mean first passage time large is that on average a trajectory will make
many failed attempts to reach B so that the mean non-reactive time is multiplied by the large
factor (1 — p)/p.

3. Computing mean passage times in channel flow

(a) Choice of the score function for band decay and splitting

The choice of the score function is critical for the AMS algorithm. In our case, we need functions
that quantify the transition progress between the one-band state A and either the laminar state Bo
