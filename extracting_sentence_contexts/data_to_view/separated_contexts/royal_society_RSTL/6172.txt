Joux Evans, F.S.A.*

Thus the inquiry had not the adyantage of all the co-operation for which I had hoped ;
nor was I more fortunate in Paris, for my friends there, upon whom I called in the hope
that they might join me, were absent in the country. On my arrival at Abbeville,
M. Boucuen DE PERTHES at once accompanied me to the seyeral localities he had described,
opened his interesting collection for examination at my leisure, and placed me in full
possession of all the facts bearing upon his discoveries. To M. Marcorre, Curator of
the excellent local Museum of Abbeville, I am indebted for information on many points
respecting the organic remains and the recent fauna of the district.
