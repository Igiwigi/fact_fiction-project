Earth.

For a conservative system, the body force vector F has in the rotating frame, based on the
tangent-plane model, the components

F=(0,0,-), (2.7)

with g=9.8ms~* the constant gravitational acceleration at the Earth’s surface.

Associated with the equations of motion are appropriate boundary conditions. The free water
surface moves together with the fluid, thus the normal velocity of a fluid particle on this surface is
the normal velocity of the surface itself. At the rigid bottom the situation is similar except for the
fact that the surface is stationary. Below a certain level, one can consider the flow to be stationary,
and therefore one can take at the bottom U = 0. These two impermeability conditions are purely
kinematic, involving only velocity components. Dynamical conditions, implicating forces, are also
necessary. At the free surface one requires the pressure to be prescribed: P = Ps, P, being the
pressure at the free surface.

Exact solutions to this full problem are very difficult to find. We caution that, even by
neglecting the Coriolis force, there is only one explicit exact solution for the travelling gravity
water waves—Gerstner’s wave, which describes (in Lagrangian variables) two-dimensional
rotational gravity waves in deep-water flow [26-28]. The Gerstner solution is possible if the water
has constant as well as non-constant density [29,30]. This remarkable fact is due to the special
character of these waves, namely that, in a frame of reference moving with the waves, the
streamlines are also the lines of constant pressure, and thus the stratification of the fluid, which
