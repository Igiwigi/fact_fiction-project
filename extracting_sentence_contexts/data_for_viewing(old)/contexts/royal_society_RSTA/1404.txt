Figure 3a). The pulse-like propagation mode has been previously observed on rate-weakening,
slip-law faults by [9]. When considering the same injection scenario and loading conditions,
but on the ageing-law fault, the propagation is crack-like (electronic supplementary material,
figure S3a’) and the EoM prediction is adequate (electronic supplementary material, figure S5).

Finally, we establish whether the EoM predictions are consistent with the underlining
assumption of the localized nature of the pore pressure perturbation, l9(t) « ¢(#), or, conversely,
forecast the conditions (e.g. on the fluid injection volume and/or the rate of injection) under which
the slip propagation along the fault outpaces the pore pressure diffusion. The diffusion front
