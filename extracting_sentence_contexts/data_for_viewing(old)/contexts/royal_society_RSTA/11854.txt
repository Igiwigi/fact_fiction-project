The fact is that the alternatives (i) and (ii) exist because there are two lattice
arrangements of wnequal numbers, and the signs of equality and inequality are
arranged in (i) and (ii) so that the required sum may be separated into two non-
overlapping systems in correspondence with the lattice arrangements. The fact that

r>q in (ii), q being a letter prior to 7 in alphabetical order, is in direct corre-
spondence with the Greek letter permutation «8|«8, in which a B precedes an a
which is prior to it in alphabetical order. Moreover, 7 occurring in the second place
in the condition (ii), p= 7 > q=s clearly contributes the integer 2 to the exponent
C+2B+3A+4s+2. Thus the numerator finally determined is necessarily the lattice
function L( ; 2, 2) found by the specified rules,
