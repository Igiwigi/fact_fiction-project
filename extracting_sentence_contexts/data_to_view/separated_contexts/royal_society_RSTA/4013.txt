Furthermore, figure 9 shows that ECE increases with increasing film thickness. This may be explained by considering that, by increasing the film thickness, the effect of the
substrate constraint throughout the film diminishes. This corroborates the findings of previous
works reporting that ECE is, in fact, strongly affected by a misfit-strain effect, which can, in turn,
be tailored by adjusting the film thickness [18-21].

4. Conclusion

Full-perovskite PBLZST thin films were fabricated by a sol-gel method. These films were
characterized by tetragonal and rhombohedral phases, as opposed to the tetragonal phase
observed in PBLZST ceramic.
