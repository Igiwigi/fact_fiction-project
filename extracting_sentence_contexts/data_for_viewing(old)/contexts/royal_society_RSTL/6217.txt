272 DR. HERMANN KOPP ON THE RELATION BETWEEN BOILING-POINT

alcohol, C,HzO,, boils (Canovnrs and HorMaxs) at 103% (From Table V. this boiling-
point was calculated at 107%. Acetone, C, Hy O,, isomeric with the former, boils at 56*
(Lizp16, Duwas, Kory).

In cases like the last, the determination of the boiling-point of a compound, together
with an examination of the substances with which the compound 1s serially allied in
boiling-point, may be of great assistance in fixing its character, the type to which it
belongs, and the series of homologous bodies of which it is a term. The examples just
quoted of the fact that isomeric 8ubstances of different series possess different boiling-
points, may here again serve as illustrations. 'The boiling-point of the s0-called eugenic
acid (BRiNING, 248%; WiLLIAMs, 251*) shows that this substance, although represented
by the formula C,, H,, O,, cannot possibly be homologous to benzoic acid, C,, Hz O, (boil-
ing-point observed by Kore, 250?; calculated, Table VI., 253®), This result might be
inferred with the greatest probability from the boiling-point of the two substances, even
if cuminic acid, isomeric with eugenic acid, and the homologue of benzoic acid, were not
known. On the other hand, when the boiling-points of engenic acid and of hydride of
salicyl, C,, HO, (boiling-point 1969, P1R14), are considered, it becomes extremely probable
that these two bodies are homologous. ('To the difference in composition, C;H;=3C,H,,
corresponds in this case the difference in boiling-points 250—196=54=3 x 187.)

'The boiling-points of polymeric compounds are also different, and may serve to deter-
