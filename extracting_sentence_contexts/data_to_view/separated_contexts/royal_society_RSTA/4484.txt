Third, several implications follow from the first two conclusions, that uncertainty is
unavoidable and that uncertainty has primarily adverse consequences. (i) Scientists have an
obligation to better convey uncertainty and to convey it using a range of complementary tools. Decision-makers have an obligation to develop agreed decision pathways to support their yes/no
decision-making. Some of the articles in this issue report findings that can assist with those
obligations. (ii) Because at least some further climate change is now inevitable, due to the delays
in climate system response to emission cuts and due to the fact that even our most ambitious
COP21 proposals assume only modest reductions in global COz emissions, we will need to
place increasing emphasis on adaptation and building community resilience. This is a vast
arena that can benefit from further research. Adaptation will be particularly challenging due to
existing scientific uncertainty and especially the propagation of that uncertainty through complex
biological, social and political systems. (iii) The adverse impacts of uncertainty, and especially its
implications for the costs and nature of adaptation, should empower decision-makers to take
mitigative action and to support greater cuts to greenhouse gas emissions.
