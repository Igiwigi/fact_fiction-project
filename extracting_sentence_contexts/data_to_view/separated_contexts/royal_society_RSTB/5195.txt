LYMPHATICS IN THE COD (GADUS MORRHUA). 341

Apart from this the findings are, so far as they go, on all fours with the facts observed
in greater detail in the Cod and increase the probability that a system of “ fine”
vessels complementary to the arteries is not an isolated occurrence but is common to
Teleostean Fishes in general.

4. Morphological Status of the“ Fine” Vessel System. With only the facts furnished by my investigation of Lophius at my disposal, I was
unable to offer any suggestion as to the morphology of the “ fine ** vessels beyond point-
ing out the similarity of their structure to that of small arteries (4, p. 41). The extension of the system into the caudal region, now observed in the Cod, led me
to investigate more fully than I had done the literature dealing with the vascularisation
of the tail in Fishes, and has opened up a contact with the work of previous observers
hitherto wanting, and thrown considerable light on the morphological status of the system
as a whole. At first the possibility suggested itself that this aortic extension of the“ fine ” system
might represent the subvertebral (hemal) lymphatic trunks described by many
anatomists in the hemal canal and beneath the vertebre in the abdomen and tail.
