We claim that:

(P) if u is a T-periodic solution of (3.2) for a given 0 < @ <1, satisfying |t|o. <1, then |tl’|oo <
M,.

In fact, if the above property were false, there would exist to, t; € R, with to < ty and ty — to < T,
such that w’(to) =0 and u'(t;) =M,. This implies, recalling the Nagumo condition (f3) applied to
the map 6f,

which is a contradiction, and our assertion is proven.

Now, let E, F, P,Q and J be as in §2b, take the open and bounded subset 22, of E given by
