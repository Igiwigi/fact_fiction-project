The urine of General Paralyties does produce a fall of arterial pressure when
injected into a vein; so also does a saline solution of the residue from the alcoholic
extract ; so also does the basic substance (or substances) which can be separated from
the abundant precipitate produced by phospho-tungstic acid. But exactly the same statements are true for perfectly normal urine ; the amount
of arterial fall is sometimes greater in the urine from General Paralytics, and some-
times greater in normal urine. We are therefore unable to draw any conclusions regarding these experiments,
beyond the fact that all urines contain certain bases which cause a fall of arterial
blood-pressure. The fall of pressure which occurs when the urine itself is injected
must also be in part attributed to its inorganic salts. A solution of the ash of
normal urine produces a great fall of blood-pressure.
