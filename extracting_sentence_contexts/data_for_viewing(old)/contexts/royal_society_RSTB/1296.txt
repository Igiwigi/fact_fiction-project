successful. Were the ccenenchymal tubes symmetrically distributed, either in a
quincunx or in parallel rows, the entire suppression of groups of seven and the arrest
of growth of the inner walls of twelve tubes surrounding each group, would leave the
walls of adjacent tubes projecting as twelve pseudosepta into the cavity thas formed.
In Heliolites the pseudosepta are constantly twelve in number, and their presence
appears to result from this mode of formation; but in Heliopora the explanation 1s
more difficult, and has bafiled me. It is obvious that there is no homology between


AFFINITIES OF HELIOPORA C@RULEA, 463

Q pseudosepta of such Alcyonarian corals as Heliopora and Heliolites and the septa
of the Madreporaria—a fact which has already been pointed out by Mosetny.
As regards the minute structure of the corallum, in many points I have not been
ble to make my observations agree with those of MosExery, and I have been quite
unable to reconcile his fig. 4 with any of my sections. According to him, the skeleton
is composed of a number of rods which are vertically disposed to the surface of the
colony, and are Y-shaped in section. The casnenchymal tubes are formed by the
union of the arms of the Y’s one with another, and he figures distinct sutures where
the union takes place.
T have given careful drawings in figs. 7 and 8 of a tangential section of a growing
edge of a colony, at a stage corresponding with fig. 5, and of a section parallel with
the surface of an older portion, corresponding with fig. 6. The bard tissues at the
growing tips are extremely fragile, and it is difficult to make a section thin enough to
display the structure without breaking it up altogether. I was successful only after
