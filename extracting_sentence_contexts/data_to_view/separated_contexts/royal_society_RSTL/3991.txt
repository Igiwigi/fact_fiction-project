78. These facts, and the fact already pointed out by Mr. Guiurves, that the nucleus
of the red nucleated corpuscle of the blood of the early mammiferous embryo is about
the same size as the © red corpuscles” in the same blood, which are similar to those of
the fully-formed blood of the animal, were sufficient to draw my attention to the
correspondence in size between the cellzxform nucleus of the nucleated cell and the

purpose it occurred to me that the blood of the Elephant (in which the © red cor-
