100': 8.5 : : 9311 : 281.43. Consequently 281,43 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas were
given off in 55 minutes. In this experiment we meet with a remarkable fact, viz. that
as much carbonic acid gas was given off in 55 minutes, as in
the former experiment in eleven minutes ; $0 that it appears,
whenever atmospheric air is taken into the lungs, it returns
charged with about 8 per cent. carbonic acid.
