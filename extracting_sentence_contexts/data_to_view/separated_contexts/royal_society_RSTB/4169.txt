This would indicate
that the nerve ends in these muscles are weakened very early in the action, before
any distinct change can be made out in the respiratory muscles proper, but not before
there is paresis of the eyelid muscles, permitting the upper lid to fall slightly. This
passage of saliva into the larynx would not be serious in normal animals, but in the
weakened condition of the respiratory muscles forms a considerable obstruction to the
breathing. Its import is shown by the fact that tracheotomy restores the respiration
in rabbits, at any rate temporarily in some cases. At the same time, tracheotomy by
shortening the respiratory passages may increase the efficiency of the feeble move-
ments of the thorax. The unusual moisture of the lungs and the infaretion which is
often met with appear to arise from the saliva insufflated.
