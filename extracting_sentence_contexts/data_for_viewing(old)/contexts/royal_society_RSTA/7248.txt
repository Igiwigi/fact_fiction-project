(Paschen 1932) of aluminium.

The Al—C bond energy in monomeric aluminium trimethyl is calculated from its heat
of atomization to be 94 kcal., assuming the C—H bonds to have the same strength as in
methane.

(f) The. tin-carbon link
The energy that would be absorbed by the change
Sn(C,H;), [gas] > Sn (*P)) +4C,H;

is 195-9 kcal., amounting to 49 kcal. per Sn—C link ruptured. Unfortunately, the amount
of energy required to raise the tin atom from the 5s?5p? to the lowest 555% configuration is
not known with certainty. That it is fairly large is seen from the fact that for Sn* the change
55°5p, Py > 5s5p", *P, involves no less than 44,509 cm.~! (McCormick & Sawyer 1938).
Whereas the figure we require is expected to be smaller, it will approach this order of
magnitude. Meggers (1940), from an examination of the emission spectrum of Sn, has
fixed two levels which he considers are probably attributable to sp% terms. The lower of
these is situated 39,625-5 cm.~! or 113-2 kcal. above the ground %P, state, and, being of the
right order of magnitude, is probably the level which is required. Adopting this figure
tentatively, the value of D(C,H;—Sn(C,H;),) is 77-3 kcal., provided the energy of re-
organization of the Sn(C,H,), residue is negligible.

By assuming that the C—C and C—H bond energies are the same as in ethane, the value of
the Sn—C bond energy in tin tetraethy] is calculated from the molecular heat of atomization
to be 81 kcal.
