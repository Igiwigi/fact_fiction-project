Further, it is shown that, by using
two coils separated to a considerable distance, it is possible so to proportion the radii
and the distance apart of the coils that the error of mean radius of the coil does not
affect the result; the diameter of the dise and the distance apart of the two coils are
then the important quantities. Lord Rayieren remarks: “It is clear that M
vanishes both when A is very small and when it is very large; from which it follows
that there must be some value of A for which the effect is a maximum and therefore
independent of small variations of A.”, The same is, of course, true for the dise ; by
suitably proportioning the dimensions, the error of mean radius of the dise may be
rendered negligibly small. This fact led Mr. A. CAmpBeti* to design a standard of
mutual inductance in which the radius of the secondary is not required to be known
with great precision ; it also guided us in fixing the dimensions of our coils and dises
so that the diameters of the latter need not be accurately known.
