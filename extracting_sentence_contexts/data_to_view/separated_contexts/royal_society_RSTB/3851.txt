AGAR: EXPERIMENTS ON INHERITANCE IN PARTHENOGENESIS. Of course the assumption is here made that the difference between the groups is
due to environmental conditions and not to genetic differences between the lines or
clones composing the different groups. This assumption is justified by the fact that
in different generations the successive groups—arranged in order of time of birth—do
not bear the same relations to one another as regards the size of the individuals,
though the same clones or lines appear in the main in the same grouping in each
generation. Thus for example the groups in the polyclonal population, numbered in
order of time of birth, when arranged in order of the mean size of the individuals in
each group give in Generation 2—4, 5, 3, 6, 2, 1, and in Generation 5—7, 5, 1, 2, 6, 3; 4,

and in the monoclonal population in Generation 4—1, 2, 5, 7, 4, 6, 8, and in
Generation 5—7, 3,6, 2, 5, 4, 1. (The increase, in the later generations, of the period
between the first and last births of each generation accounts for the greater number
of groups in the later generations.)

Finally it must be emphasised that any process which may slightly affect the
absolute values of the correlation coefficients may be disregarded for our purposes, for
here we are chiefly concerned with (1) the relative magnitudes of the coefficients
between offspring and more and more remote ancestry, each generation having been
treated in the same way, and (2) the comparison of the coefficients of the monoclonal
with those of the polyclonal populations, each population having been treated in the
same way. |

Each generation, therefore, both of the polyclonal and monoclonal populations was
treated in this way (with the slight modification in the case of the small strain of the
polyclonal population, to be referred to later on) both for birth and adult measure-
ments. ‘The measurements thus treated will be referred to hereafter as corrected in
distinction to the actual or uncorrected measurements. Inheritance within the Polyclonal Population.
