The removal of the frame connecting the two axles leaves one-half of the thread
with a constant twist, while the other half has during each observation a slightly
variable amount of twist depending on the temperature and the intensity of the
gravitational force. Any change of gravitational force has now to be compensated by
a change in the twist of one-half of the thread, consequently the vernier arm has

Readings reduced to 25° C,

now to be moved through twice the angle necessary with the former arrangement ;
the reading-sensitiveness of the instrument was, in fact, doubled by this change. A gravitational survey, connecting the towns of the eastern Queensland seaboard
with Sydney, was now projected, the first connecting station chosen being Armidale, a
town on the table-land in the northern part of New South Wales. The observations
given in Plot 3 show an immense improvement in the behaviour of the balance,
though they give evidence of a break of 5 sextant minutes in the reading on
returning to Sydney—due to the shaking which the instrument had experienced in
transport.
