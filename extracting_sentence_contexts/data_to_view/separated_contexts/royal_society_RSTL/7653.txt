No higher compound of bromine and yanadium than the tribromide could be obtained. The volatile liquid passing into the bulb in the first preparation was carefully rectified,
and it was all found to distil over at the boiling-point of bromine, leaving only a small
quantity of the tribromide in the bulb. Some difficulty was experienced in obtaining
satisfactory analytical results with the tribromide, owing to the fact, already observed by
STas*, that bromide of silver, when boiled with excess of nitrate of silver, carries down with
it some of this latter salt inclosed in the bromide, and that this impurity cannot be got rid
of by washing. Owing to this admixture of nitrate of silyer the bromine determinations
usually come out about two per cent. too high, whilst the vanadium determinations
gave constant numbers, agreeing much more nearly with the calculated results. Thus
in four analyses of the tribromide prepared on different occasions the mean percentage
of bromine was found to be 8415, the calculated percentage being 82:4; whilst the
vanadium determinations of the same portions gaye 18:57 per cent. instead of 17'6 per
cent.
