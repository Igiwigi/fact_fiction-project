Relative lightness of moulds and bacteria.—The ratio of bacteria to moulds is
considerably affected if the air remains quiet for any length of time, as the bacteria
(or rather the particles to which they are attached), as a rule, settle out much more
rapidly than moulds. In fact, the moulds settle out so slowly that we have never
noticed the effects of their subsidence in the course of our observations. The relative lightness of moulds as compared with the particles to which bacteria are
attached has already been observed by Hesse (‘Mitth. a. d. K. Gesundheitsamte,’ vol. 2,
p. 186), who found that moulds, as a rule, penetrate much further into the tubes
before settling down on the jelly than bacteria do.
