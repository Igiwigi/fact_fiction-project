square. Since the accuracy of the results is not sufficient to detect definitely a circula-
tion around one of these squares not exceeding 0-01, the numbers given in the squares
can only be considered as an indication that over the greater part of the field the
circulation around any contour not including the aérofoil is sensibly zero, A long
narrow contour (ABCFGJ, fig. 8) was drawn as close to the surface as the observations
permitted, and the circulation round it was found to be 0-748. The estimated circulation
round IAB just above the nose was found to be — 0-25; but this is almost certainly
in error on account of uncertainties in the measurement of velocities along IB. In
this neighbourhood only the observations with a hot wire were of any value at all, and
the velocities so measured may easily have been 5 per cent. in error, which fact,
together with possible errors in direction, is sufficient to account for the whole of the
calculated circulation. Again, the circulation round JGH was 0-030; but,
unfortunately, possible errors of observation in the neighbourhood of J were large
enough to account for a great deal of this. The general conclusion, however, may be
drawn that circulation close to the aérofoil is appreciably less than that around larger
contours, and in all probability is zero on the aérofoil. The difference between the
circulations for contours KLMN and XYZWVUTH is hardly outside the limits of.
experimental error, and both these contours may be considered to give the maximum
circulation corresponding to the lift; but the difference between either of these and
ABCEGJ is probably a genuine indication of the existence of vorticity at some little
distance from the aérofoil surface.
