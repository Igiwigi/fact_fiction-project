Cor. Tf k=1 the point P coincides with U, and the point will in this case be a double
point in the sphero-quartic, and the sphero-quartic itself will be the inverse of a plane
conic from a point outside the plane of the conic. In fact if the sphere Q be inverted
into a plane from the point U, it is easy to see that the point P' will be inverted into a
point whose locus is a conic,
