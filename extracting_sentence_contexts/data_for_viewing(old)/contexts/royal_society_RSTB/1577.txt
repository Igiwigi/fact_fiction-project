digposed plate of bone grows downwards, and is so arranged that ity two sitrfices look
directly torwords and backwards respectively (figs. 3 and 6, plp.). The posterior
face of each plate is comparatively smooth, and at the same tinte faintly coucave, and,
tmoreaver, is so applied to the crescentic extremity of the anterior division of the
tranaverse process of the fourth vertebra as to fill up the concavity of the latter, and

also prujest outwards beyond it (fig, 3). In fact, the outer portion of the post-
temporal plate completes the cireumference of a cireular bony structire, of which the
yentrol agi inter margins are furnished by the crescentic process, The latter also
helpe to slightly deepen the concavity of the posterior face of the plate by strongtlening

terior face of each plate there isa curved facet for artioulation with « similarly shaped
siufiice on the adjacent anterior edge of the root of the crescentic process (fig, 6, 2).
The antetior face of the plate, which is greatly thickened towards the centre, is
A somewhat convex, and is also traversed by a groove continued dorsally into a deep
“ tubulur socket for the reception of the slender proximal extremity of the clavicle

2 side firmly united to the crescentic extremity of the transverse process by ligamentous
