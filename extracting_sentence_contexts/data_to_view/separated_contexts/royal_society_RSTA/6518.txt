Its pointed out that there are two separate mechanisms for upstream influonco through the
boundary layer in supersonic flow, and that one of these (that involving separation) operates
also in subsonic flow. A quantitative theory of subsonic flow up a stop is given to illustrate
this. Tho main differences between the subsonic and supersonic flows are as follows:

(i) Tho boundaries of dead-air regions aro noarly straight in supersonio flow but are usually
highly curved in subsonic flow.

(ii) Separation (whether of tho laminar or turbulent layer) occurs at a much lower
pressuro coefficient in supersonic flow; this is only slightly due to tho fact that tho fluid
nearest the wall is then lighter and so moro easily brought to rest; it is duo much more to the
relative suddenness of tho prossure riso ahoad of the dead-sir region.

(ii) However, for a given pressure cosfficiont in the dead-air rogion, tho distance of
upstream influence is somewhat groater in the subsonic flow, except at tho highost prossures. A quolitative discussion of the second mechanism of upstream influence, in supersonic flow,
is given; for a quantitative theory of this seo part IL (Lighthill r953)-

1, INTRODUCTION: MECHANISMS OF UPSTREAM INFLUENCE

In the well-known inviscid theory of supersonic flow, a disturbance at a point can
have an upstream influence only if it is so strongly compressive as to reduce the
local fluid speed below that of sound. But it is now many years einco Ferri (1939)
found that disturbances can have an upstream influence, through the agency of the
boundary layer, when on the inviscid theory they would have none.
