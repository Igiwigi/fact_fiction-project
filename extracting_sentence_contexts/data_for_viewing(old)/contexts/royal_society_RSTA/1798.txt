]. Introduction

Tropospheric ozone (O3) occurs naturally in the environment but industrialization has seen a
steady increase in O3 pollution as anthropogenic emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon
monoxide (CO), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and methane (CH4)
have led to the formation of O3 through photochemical reactions. This has caused O3 levels
to increase from concentrations of less than 20 ppb in pre-industrial times [1] to current
levels that have increased Northern mid-latitude average O3 concentrations to 30-50 ppb [2].
Since the 1950s mean O3 concentrations have been growing at a rate of 1-5 ppb/decade in
the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and by 2 ppb/decade in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) [2].
As these concentrations have risen, evidence of O3 injury and damage to vegetation due
to the phyto-toxic nature of O3, has also increased substantially over the last half-century
[1]. The fact that O3 is a secondary pollutant leads to significant geospatial and temporal
variability in O3 concentrations caused by conditions such as downwind proximity to large-
scale emission sources, meteorological patterns (such as seasonality, land-coastal processes and
monsoon systems) and stratosphereâ€”-troposphere exchange. This means that O3 concentrations
tend to be highest in rural and semi-rural areas downwind of urban and industrial sources of
pre-cursor emissions, i.e. in those locations important for agriculture, forestry and grasslands,
along with the ecosystem services they provide [3]. O3 and its precursors are also transported
around the world in air masses; when O3 degradation (by chemical transformation and
deposition) is slower than O3 generation, background O3 concentrations will be enhanced.
These global processes influence local-to-regional O3 concentrations (including the duration,
frequency and magnitude of O3 levels), all of which are important in determining vegetation
response.
