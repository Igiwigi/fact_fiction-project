The concept of potentiality, vague though it may be, may help the intuition. For instance,
it helps us to understand why symmetry is more important in quantum than in classical
physics. (When a vacation is still potential, there may be a high rotational symmetry of
directions in which it may be taken, but when one buys a ticket to a destination the
symmmetry is broken!) Quantum nonlocality is also illuminated to some extent by the
concept of potentiality. Thus, in the singlet state of a pair of fermions, the spin of particle
1 and the spin of particle 2 are strictly correlated with respect to all axes, but that fact is
inseparable from the fact that all components of spin are merely potential. [14, p. 309]

In Shimony’s view, at most, potentia captures the indefiniteness of quantum properties, which are
significant in relation to entanglement. About Heisenberg’s specific mention of Aristotle’s notion
of 5vvapts (potentia) in his interpretation of quantum mechanics, Shimony argued that

The historical reference should perhaps be dismissed, since quantum mechanical
potentiality is completely devoid of teleological significance. What it has in common with
Aristotle’s conception is the indefinite character of certain properties of the system.
