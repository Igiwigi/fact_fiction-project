In regard to the other two integrals required for (19) and (22), viz.

\ tanh  sin nx dx and \ coth x 8in nw da,
. Li

it is to be observed that, stated in this form, their values are indeterminate; for the

former
= (1 _ = ;) 8n nx dr,
=ſ(1+z

both of which involve cos oo. But in point of fact for our purpose the o of the limit
of the integral is not arbitrary, but is to be of the form (m+1)z, the lower limit being

and the latter

then m infinite,
