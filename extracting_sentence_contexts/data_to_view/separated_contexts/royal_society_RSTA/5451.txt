for different ranges of force, can be considerably raised by the heating
and cooling process; thus the limit in the case of the iron wires last-mentioned was

sufficient number of times. A much longer piece of the same rod gave exactly the same values of
A and B.

+ This seems to be also true as regards the accommodating effects in torsional cycles.
