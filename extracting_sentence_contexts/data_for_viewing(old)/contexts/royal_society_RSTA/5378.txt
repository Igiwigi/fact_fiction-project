oroblem. This is particularly recurrent in billiard problems [60], a nice example
veing the scars of classical orbits for excited states of the stadium billiard [61].

Quantum chaos is not restricted to the above discussed aspects, other
oroperties are also used to characterize quantum chaology. Although we are
not going to discuss them here, for completeness, we just cite a few other
identification possibilities: special features of wave-packet dynamics, the structure
of avoided crossing (as we change parameters of the Hamiltonian), ergodicity in
he wave-function state space; dynamical localization, etc.

As a last discussion in this section, we briefly comment on the very fundamental
question of why a system that is nonlinear classically, when quantized should
resent particular features distinguishing it from the integrable case. In fact,
his query does not have a definite answer, partially because we still do not
know the precise border between the classical and quantum realms. A partial
and rather speculative explanation has its foundations in an important point
raised by Einstein [62] in 1917. Yet in the pre-QM era, the so-called Einstein
Brillouin-Keller (EBK) rules [51] already would lead to the (semiclassical)
quantization of a problem in terms of invariant tori of the classical phase space.
But such structures are possible only for integrable systems. Hence, Einstein
yointed out that the quantization of chaotic dynamics was not possible in that
way. Many years later, in breakthrough work, Gutzwiller derived his famous
race formula [51,63]. It associates the quantum spectra density of states with
he periodic orbits of the classical problem. Without going into detail, the
exact mathematical form of such an expression (in fact, of its pre-exponential
