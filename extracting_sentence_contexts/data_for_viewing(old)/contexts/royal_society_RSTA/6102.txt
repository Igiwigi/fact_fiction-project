both quantities are similar, the degree only takes into account the existence of a link, regardless
of its weight, so it quantifies a property of the unweighted structure of the network, also referred
to as the topology of the graph in common complex-network parlance. The strength, on the other
hand, quantifies a property of the weighted structure. The disparity of a node i, Y;, quantifies the
heterogeneity of the distribution of the weights intersecting it [48]. The local clustering coefficient c;,
as well as its weighted generalization c?’, characterize the density of links among the neighbours
of the node [41,49]. The mathematical definition of each quantity can be found in table 1.

The distributions of these quantifiers in the network, or the relations between them, often
provide a tangible and understandable, albeit limited, description of even very large systems. In
this paper, we will also consider the community structure—a so-called mesoscopic property—of
the entanglement networks. This refers to a property commonly observed in complex networks,
namely, the fact that nodes can be grouped into communities such that the density of links among
the members of each community is considerably higher than the overall density in the network.

3. The XX model

In the literature of quantum spin Hamiltonians, and generally when studying quantum phase
transitions, one often works in the thermodynamic limit or considers closed boundary conditions
wherein translational invariance is generally guaranteed. This implies that most two-spin
correlation functions, including concurrence, which is built upon them, depend only on the
distance between the spins [36,50,51]. However, for realistic experimental scenarios, i.e. for
