a the petiole is cut obliquely, but in a nearly longitudinal direction. The continuity of
E the cortical tissues between petiole and stem is evident. The vascular bundle is well
shown in the petiole, but the plane of section does not allow us to trace it into the
stem. The structure of the petiole is essentially the same as in H. Grievii. It is
© remarkable that it appears to contain a single vascular bundle only, for the leaf-traces
- in the stem of this species are nearly always in pairs, as in Lyginodendron.§ The
2 twin bundles may have completely fused on entering the leaf. We think there is no
= doubt that the pair of bundles imbedded in the pericycle, figured in Memoir XIII.,
g Plate 22, fig. 5, are leaf-trace bundles, which are just separating from the stele, “ad
each of which still retains its own external are of secondary tissue. Exactly parallel
cases are well known in Lyginedendron and have been fully described above.

Beyond the fact that the stem bore adventitious roots, we have no information as
to these organs. We regard the body represented in Memoir XIII., Plate 23, fig. 12,
as the base of an adventitious root at its junction with the wood of the stem. It is
very probable that the structure represented in Plate 22, fig. 13, is also connected
with the base of a root.

* Some doubt was expressed in Memoir XIIL., p. 293, as to these elements being really thick-walled
cells. Tt was suggested that their appearance might be due to the conditions of mineralization producing
inorganic deposits on the cell-walls. We now find that the structure of these cells is the same as that
of the undoubtedly sclerotic elements which constituted the horizontal plates of the cortex. Like the
latter they persist when the surrounding soft tissue has perished. Similar cells occur in the dilated
