The family Bikoecida was made by Stein (1878)
to include this genus and Poteriodendron, a somewhat similar but colonial form, probably
identical with Stylobryon Fromentel (1874). James-Clark describes with great con-
viction both the structure of Bicoeca lacustris and the changes occurring during
‘development’. But, admirable as are James-Clark’s descriptions and figures, there
are reasons for supposing that certain features were misinterpreted, and that the
forms which he observed do not, as he implies, represent stages in a developmental
sequence, but are, in fact, separate species. ;

B. lacustris (see figure 1) is said (in his account) to have a yellow tinge; the animal
occupies the anterior half of the calyx and projects a little beyond the edge. The
shape is rather elliptical than elongate-oval, varying between the two conditions, and
is the latter in the largest individuals. The body is rounded posteriorly and broadest in
the middle, tapers to a truncate front, and ends on one side in a laterally projecting
flagellum and on the opposite side in a long, incurved lip.
