These and similar facts make it appear likely that the Lower Carboniferous land surface
sloped down from the North Derbyshire area to a basin of deposition occupying the Lanca-
shire and Cheshire plain. It is probable therefore that sedimentation was continuous here
from the Lower Carboniferous into the Millstone Grit, and that the thickness of sediments
deposited in the Nook and Astley Green region was at least as much as is met with in North
Derbyshire; that is to say, it was at least 3000 ft. The beginning of the Lower Carboniferous
period was marked by a gradual marine transgression. However, most of Wales and the
Midlands remained a land area until well on into the Lower Carboniferous, and it seems
possible that the land-mass stretched north as far as Derbyshire, since the oldest Lower
Carboniferous deposits there do not seem to be much earlier than the zone of S, (Cope 1949).
In North Wales the deposits are of the epi-continental sea type, the shoreline lying not far
to the south, as evinced by the fact that the basement beds occupy only the hollows in the
Lower Palaeozoic synclines. In the early part of the Lower Carboniferous the sea was bounded
to the north by the rigid Lower Palaeozoic block of north-west Yorkshire, the shoreline
lying along the Craven Fault. South of the shoreline lay the deepest part of the sea in which

were deposited a great thickness of shales and thin limestones. In Derbyshire about 1500 ft.
of limestones are exposed, and a further 900 ft. were proved in a boring near the crest of the
Pennine anticline in Woo Dale (Cope 1949). Underlying the limestones were a series of
green and purple volcanic rocks of presumed Pre-Cambrian age. In the mid-Pennine area
south of the Craven Fault, the thickness of strata is of the order of 6000 ft. and the lowest
