Since then
it has been discussed by many writers of whom we shall here mention two only,
Brrtranp} and Boret,{ whose differing views serve well to illustrate the point from
which we shall approach the subject. BERTRAND put into statistical form a variety of hypotheses, as for example the
hypothesis that a given group of stars with relatively small angular distances between
them as seen from the earth, form a “‘ system” or group in space. His method of
attack, which is that in common use, consisted essentially in calculating the probability,
P, that a certain character, x, of the observed facts would arise if the hypothesis tested
were true. If P were very small, this would generally be considered as an indication
that the hypothesis, H, was probably false, and vice versa. BERTRAND expressed the’
pessimistic view that no test of this kind could give reliable results.
