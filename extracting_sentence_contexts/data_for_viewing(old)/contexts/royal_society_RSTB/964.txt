Guodification of the one described by one of us (C.) in vol. 184, ‘Phil. Trans. ;’ it was
Blosed hermetically above by an india-rubber stopper fitting perfectly air-tight ; whilst’
Bhe opening through which the thread passes to the lever was closed below by a little
Giercury. The thread works without friction. Stimulation is effected by passing a
gingle opening induction shock from the electrode in contact with the femur clamp, to
fhe tendo Achillis, by means of a fine wire attached to the hook inserted into the
“fatter (see fig. 3). The nitrite was introduced by passing the capillary pipette
Gniaining it through a small tube luted into the side of the chamber, having a
‘Eontinuation of india-rubber provided with a screw clamp; the introduction of a small
Baction of a drop of distilled water into the tube behind the nitrite, as a preliminary,
ured the complete emptying of the nitrite contained in the tube by displacement,
‘Bn blowing gently through it with a pair of hand bellows. No escape was possible
fom the chamber; the fact that the characteristic odour of the nitrite was not
Becognizable in its vicinity, and further that when the cork was removed, frequently
after an interval of more than two hours, the odour of the drug was still distinct
Srthin the chamber, showed that the precautions for preventing an escape were
"fatisfactory in their ie aaa The amounts of the nitrites introduced into the
@hamber varied from #5 to 335 cub. centim. The second muscle for the control
Bxperiment was kept at a like temperature under filter paper moistened with normal
Balt solution.
Although no difference in the reaction of the second muscle owing to the delay in
ts examination seemed probable, nevertheless in different experiments the order of
examination of two contrasted nitrites was reversed, but the results in the two cases
Were found to be perfectly uniform. A very extensive series of experiments was
hecessary, as it is impossible to contrast the gastrocnemius of one Frog with that of
