} We therefore assume, as a first approximation, that the contribution from any
clement of the distorted surface is the same as if the rest of the surface were in the
same plane as the element and had the same velocity ; that this assumption, in the
case of simple distortions, leads to results of the right character, is easily verified. The determination of « depends on the fact that if the width of an arm measured
in the direction of the velocity of the point in question be c, and if f stand for the
