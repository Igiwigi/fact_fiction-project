is the atomic weight and e the electronic charge. (This nucleus, together with the
number of electrons found from the scattering of X-rays, constitutes a neutral atom.)

Bonr* on certain assumptions has shown that such an atom is capable of forming
the basis of an explanation of the line spectra of hydrogen and helium, agreeing in a
most remarkable way with experimental fact.

Mosetey,t too, has given further evidence in support of the conclusion as to the
number of electrons per atom. His “atomic numbers” are identical with the values
given above.

This agreement is probably much more remarkable and significant than it at first
sight appears. For apart from the orthodox electromagnetic theory of radiation, the
intensity of the scattered radiation might have been anything between say yolyo part
and 1000 times what was experimentally observed; yet the value experimentally
determined twelve years ago—long before the precise significance of the results could
be realized—agrees within a very small fraction with that to be expected on the modern
conception of the atom and the old electromagnetic theory of radiation. Originally,
