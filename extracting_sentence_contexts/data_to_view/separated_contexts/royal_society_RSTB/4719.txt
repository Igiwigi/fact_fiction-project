Prof. Compton very kindly entrusted to me the anatomical investigation of his formalin}
specimens of T’mesipteris, and it is with great pleasure that 1 record here my sincere
thanks to him. I also wish to express my gratitude to Prof. A. C. Sewarp, F.R.S., in
whose laboratory the research was originally begun,{ for the interest he showed in the
work during the early stages. Moreover, the fact that he very kindly undertook to
revise the manuscript has now afforded me the benefit of his able criticism and valuable
suggestions, for which also it is a genuine pleasure to me to offer my sincerest thanks
to him.

TAXONOMY. In the concluding chapter of BERTRAND’s monograph§ there is an admirable critique
of the earlier literature, so that we need not refer to it here. Among the dried
specimens at his disposal Berrranp could recognize only a single species.
