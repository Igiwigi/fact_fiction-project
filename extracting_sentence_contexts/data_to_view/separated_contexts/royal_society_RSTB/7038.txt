It is the lower surface of the infra-
aquatic peat which constitutes the Boundary Horizon, and if the flooding is a slow and
progressive process it is evident that the precursor peat will form soonest in the deep
hollows of the old bog surface and last upon its hummocks. Thus the Boundary Horizon
would be of different date at different places, and Jonas brings forward some pollen-
analysis evidence in support of this. The great importance of Jonasâ€™s interpretation appears
to lie in the fact that it turns attention to the task of recognizing the precise nature of the
change-over in physical conditions and in vegetational cover at the Boundary Horizon. In particular, it tends to demonstrate that the effect of the climatic deterioration upon the
dried-out bog surface was not a gradual reversal through those communities by which the
bog had built up, but was the initiation of a totally new series of vegetation stages begun
by rapid flooding. These conclusions are borne upon by Somerset results.
