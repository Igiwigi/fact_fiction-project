A, vol. 181 (1890), p. 288; and vol. 188 (1896), pp. 602 and 626. + The fact that there exist substances, as, for example, cobalt, nickel, and the Heusler alloys—CuAlMn
—that contain no iron and yet are, or can be rendered, strongly magnetic, has not been overlooked. It
has also been claimed that magnetism may be induced in certain minerals, such as kyanite AlSiO,,
dolomite CaMg(CO,)2, and leucite KAISiOs, but it has not been satisfactorily proved that in these latter
cases no trace of iron is present. In any case the susceptibilities of such mineral substances are small as
compared with those of materials containing an appreciable amount of iron, and are not sufficient to
excite the disturbances measured by Mr. WALKER.
