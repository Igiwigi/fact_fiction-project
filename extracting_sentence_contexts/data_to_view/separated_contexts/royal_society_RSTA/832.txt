(d*/du) [P, (u) log (1 + »)]
each satisfy (5.1), and may thus be taken as the two independent solutions. If we
write
R, (u) = P, (u) log (1 — x),

and use the fact that P, (u) is a solution of LeGENDRE’s equation

(1 — p?) d0/dy? — Qudo/du + n(n + Dio 0;
we find that R, (2) satisfies the equation

(1 — pw?) d?0/du® — Qudo/dy + n (n+ 1)o= —2(1 + u) dP,/dp — P,.
