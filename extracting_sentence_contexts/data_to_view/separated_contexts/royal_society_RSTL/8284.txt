If we were to assume (as has been done) that the appearance of the masses of the
great continents above the sea-level was a work of elevation at all, it might be a case to
which Mr. Horx1xs's notion could perhaps apply. But that the great continents have
not been the work of such eleyatory forces at all, but have resulted from the deformation
of a cooling and contracting globe covered only by a thin and yet flexible solidified
crust, sinking over great areas and relatively or absolutely rising over others, has been

80 convincingly urged by Daxa and other American geologists that it is probably now
admitted.

23. DE 14 Brcny's notions as to elevation approached nearer to exactness than those

of most of his contemporaries*; but to one man alone, Coxgraxr Prevosr, belongs the
honour of having clearly enunciated a true theory of elevatory forces, followed out by
comparison with facts in nature, and by showing that these were inexplicable upon the
notion of direct upheaval by a radial force from beneath.

* [To cite even by name all the authors whose works contain scattered passages from which notices may be
gleaned (always more or less vague, disjointed, or even inconsecutive) as to the relation between terrestrial
refrigeration and the formation of continents, mountains, &e., is here impossible. Dr 1a Brcus, in his
© Researches in Theoretic Geology,” 1834, ÞP- 121-162 et passim, writes far more clearly and connectedly than
others of that period, His views, however, were anticipated by Przyosr.
