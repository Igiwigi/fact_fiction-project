In summary, we found that a Brg defect facilitates the generation of Frenkel pairs with rather
mobile Lif. The Vj, by contrast, seem to be strongly bound to the Lit cage around the Brg defect. This defect-induced Frenkel pair is formed regardless of the fact that one V;; has already been
introduced to the system as compensating defect for Brg. The reason for this is most probably
due to the electrostatics: the Br~ on the 4d site has a weaker attraction for Lit compared to the
nominal S?~. Moreover, the strong attraction of $*~ on the surrounding 4d sites is even able to
regularly strip another Lit from the Lit cage around Brg leaving back two V;;.
