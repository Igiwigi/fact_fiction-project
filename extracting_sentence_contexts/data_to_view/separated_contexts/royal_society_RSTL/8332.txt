If this be a correct view of the nature of the structures here described, we have now for
the first time evidence which would justify us in assigning a special apparatus of sense
to a hydroid trophosome. But with all this the resemblance between these pedunculated capsules and true
thread-cells cannot be ignored, and indeed makes us hesitate, eyen more than we may
have hitherto done, in regarding the latter merely as urticating organs. It is possible
that the pedunculated capsules may throw new light on the function and significance of
thread-cells ; but with no facts beyond those at present before us, we are scarcely in a
poxition to speculate further on this subject.

'The best display of the capsules, with their investing sacs and peduncles, was obtained
from specimens which had been for twenty-four hours immersed in a s0lution of osmic
acid of 0-1 per cent., and afterwards placed in a mixture of 100 parts of glycerine with
5 parts of acetic acid; while the most beautiful demonstration of the rod-like tissue was
found in sections which had been simply macerated in water for twenty-four hours, and
then examined, without further preparation, under the compressor. 'The more external
tissues of the capitulum had been softened and disintegrated by the maceration, and
were now easily separated by the simple action of the compressor ; while the firm, rod-
like tissue, offering more resistance to the decomposing action of the water, remained
beautifully isolated, with its component rods looking almost like the radiating acicular
crystals of certain forms of zeolite. External to the zone of pedunculated capsules is a thin layer of ectoderm, which forms
the most superficial portion of the capitulum (fig. 3). This is composed of small round
membraneless cells, containing refringent corpuscles, while the summit of the capitulum
is almost always occupied by a group of small cells, containing dark brownish-purple
pigment granules.
