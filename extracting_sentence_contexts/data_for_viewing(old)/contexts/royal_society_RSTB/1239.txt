Phylloglossum really represents, or is at all like such ancestors, it is not to be

difficult to realize how a strobilus, gifted with continued apical growth, and
fer of branching (as is foreshadowed in the sporangia of some Bryophytes as a
pnormality, and also is seen in fig. 23 in Phylloglossum) might form a larger
of sporangia than its predecessors, and the total output of spores be thus
J. But to nourish the increasing number of spores, increased vegetative
Blopment will be needed : this need is not met in the Lycopods by increase of the
ative development of the sexual, but of the non-sexual generation, and on com-
ative grounds it appears to me probable that an increased assimilative power was
red by them in the following most interesting way. Tt is a familiar fact that
‘in species of Lycopodium have alternating sterile and fertile zones ; examining
nits of the fertile zones, the sporangia, though present, are abortive ; in the
ce of these arrested sporangia I believe that we have evidence that the whole
» of sterile and fertile zones is the result of partial sterilization of a primitive
lus, all potentially fertile, but of which parts are sterilized, and carry on merely
