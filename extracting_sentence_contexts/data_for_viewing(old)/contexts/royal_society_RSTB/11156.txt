network is disconnected from the language networkâ€”on
the contrary, our {MRI experiments imply that when subjects
hear a mathematical statement, language areas are activated
first, during the sentence processing period, and only then,
if the content is mathematically relevant does processing
continue within the math network [8]. An early proposal
for the architecture of the number system, the triple-code
model [56], postulated bidirectional exchanges between the
intraparietal sulcus (representing quantity and other aspects
of number meaning), the lateral IT regions (representing the
visual number form of Arabic digits) and the left-hemispheric
language system, including the left AG (involved in the rep-
resentation and storage of numbers and arithmetic facts in
verbal form). Our data do not contradict this model, given
that listening to mathematical sentences activated language
areas involved in syntax processing and multiword semantic
integration such as the left perisylvian regions and the left
AG. This activation was lower for mathematical than for
non-mathematical sentences, but nevertheless significant,
especially in the initial phase of sentence processing. More
crucially, during the sentence listening period of our original
experiment, a small transient activation was observed in the
left AG in the contrast for meaningful compared to meaning-
less statements, both within math and non-math domains
(see figure S12 in [8]). This finding agrees with previous sug-
