Jt is, perhaps, unlikely

that the actual constitution of the pigment will be demonstrated until the artificial
substance has been prepared from uric acid by a reaction of more determinate nature
than that of hydrolysis at high temperatures. Since the product of Huastwerz is certainly not mycomelic acid, there was no
@ priori likelihood of obtaining the pigment by the other reactions which are
supposed to yield this latter substance. As a matter of fact, a careful investigation

as convinced me that the product of the action of ammonia on alloxan (Liegia and
Wonten) and the body produced by boiling azulmie acid with water (JacopsEn and

EMMERLING) are substances distinct from each other and from the HiasiwEerz
product. They give no reactions which connect them with the pigment.

_ While waiting further evidence as to its precise nature, the yellow Pierid pigment
may be conveniently known as Lepidotie acid. VI.
