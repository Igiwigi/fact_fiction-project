8, 9) tends at first sight to confirm this expectation. On
the other hand, the development of the pigment cannot be entirely dependent on the
presence of light, for it appears in the embryo, both in the pineal eye and in the
pineal sac, long before hatching, while the egg is still buried in the nest. Moreover,
the fact that wandering pigment-cells occur both in the cavity of the eye (vitreous
body) and outside the eye altogether, as well as in the retina, indicates that these
cells may pass right through the retina in one direction or the other. I have also shown in my earlier account of the development of the pineal organs
(Denby, 1899, b) that at Stage R pigment granules, similar to those found in the
pineal eye and sac, may occur in the corpuscles in the blood-vessels which lie between

the paraphysial tubules just (at this stage) beneath the pineal eye.
