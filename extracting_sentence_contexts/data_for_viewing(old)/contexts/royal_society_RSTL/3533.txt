72 MR. BOWMAN'S ADDITIONAL NOTE ON THE CONTRACTION OF MUSCLE.

tween the primitive fasciculi, and inosculate with one another by very frequent
transverse branches, which complete the vascular web, and serve to attach its several
parts to the primitive fasciculi which occupy its interstices,

Lastly, all the specimens of bloodless tetanic muscle which T have seen, have pre-
sented this striking peculiarity :—that the pallor has not occupied the whole musele,
but patches of it, comprehending a portion of many primitive fasciculi, but not the
entire length of any,—a fact tending to the same conclusion.

What has now been advanced, seems to render it —as it appears to me—certain, that
the tetanic spasm has consisted in contractions engaging only parts of each primitive
fasciculus at a time, and if 80, of course changing their place, in order to bring every
portion into use in its turn. Whether the primitive fasciculi alternate with one
another in their contractions, is an obscure question, on which these obseryations
shed no light.

It may be urged, however, that, even granting this conclusion true, it is unsafe to
argue concerning the healthy and moderate actions of an organ from the phenomena
it presents when in a morbid state. But the weight of this objection is more appa-
rent than real, for in a physiological point of view, the contractions of tetanus differ
