(a bare 200 miles south of the Newfoundland Banks), to
about 24° N. lat. ‘To the westward, specimens were found as far as our investigations
reached, viz., to Bermuda and the sea to the south of there, 7.e., to about 65° W.
long., and even here they were present in great numbers. This was an astonishing’
fact, for one would hardly have expected to find the larvee of our European eel as a
numerous population in Atlantic waters so far west as 65°—New York lies about 74°! Larvee of the American eel were also taken in our nets, but in remarkably small
numbers, amounting to only some few (3-4) per cent. of the total number of Anguilla
larvee.
