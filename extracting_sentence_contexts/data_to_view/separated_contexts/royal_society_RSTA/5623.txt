Note that
the measure is generally asymmetric as Pj(o,a) 4 Pi=(d,o), reflecting the asymmetry of real world
travel. Note also that d; is dimensionless and unaffected by the magnitude of the mobility flow. More in general, to account for the fact that not all pairs of cities are connected via a
link, the authors of [29] defined the effective distance between any pairs of network nodes
as follows. Assume I" = {11,12,...,n,} is an ordered path from any two nodes 11 to ny and
wr) = ni Pnj.1n;, then the distance of that path is defined as

AW) =L â€” log W(L). (4.5)
The effective distance, Dj(o,d), is then the path that minimizes the distance

Dim = min MD), (4.6)

which is equivalent to computing the shortest path in a network with weights computed from the
effective distance (equation (4.4)) plus one.

(d) Cartograms

We display the maps of Denmark in figure 1 as cartograms [17]. We computed the cartograms
as follows.
