The material used in the present investigation was brought together in a variety of
ways. Much of it was accumulated during the years 1903-1907, when I was
interested in the study of fishes owing to the fact that I was then assisting Sir E. Ray
LANKESTER in rearranging the exhibited series of fishes in the British Museum
(Natural History). Most of the sketches and notes made during those years were
based upon specimens contained in the Museum collection. Further material was
subsequently obtained by purchase in the markets of Grimsby, Folkestone, and other
coast towns, and in Billingsgate Fish Market, London, and some was purchased from
the Marine Biological Laboratory, at Plymouth. My acknowledgments are due to
Mr. J. Hornect for material from India during 1907-1910, to Prof. W. N. F. WoopLanp
for specimens from Naples, and to Prof. W. A. Haswett for some from Sydney.

More recently I have had the advantage of examining selected pieces of vertebral
column excised from young and embryo fishes, owing to the kindness of Mr. C. Tarx
Reean, Assistant Keeper in the Department of Zoology at the British Museum
