only because here PM25 concentrations are locally elevated, but also because urban buildings are
aerodynamically rough and capture PM) 5 more effectively than smooth desert soils. The relative
change in dry deposition between the two scenarios is particularly pronounced in the areas with
woodland vegetation and elevated wind speeds because the dry deposition velocity (Vg) of PM
scales with wind speed in addition to being enhanced to forest.

The effect of vegetation on the concentrations of the gaseous pollutants is summarized in
table 4 for 2015 with additional years in electronic supplementary material, table S2. Spatially
averaged relative reductions are largest for SOz (30% overall), followed by NH3 (25%) and O3
(13%), with somewhat smaller reductions if weighted by population and for the urban grid cells.
Surprisingly, the UK average effect is very small for NO2; the spatial pattern of figure 2 reveals
that vegetation suppresses NO) in source areas which is approximately balanced by increases
in NOz in rural areas, especially in areas with large forest cover. This is partly due to the fact
that forest soils are associated with larger NO emissions than desert sand, but other interactions



Table 3. Annual average concentrations of PM under current and no-vegetation landcover scenarios and effect of change in
concentration relative to national no vegetation scenario for 2015 meteorology (and 2014 emissions). Concentrations are in
lg m~? and averages are shown as UK area average, UK population-weighted (PW) average and as an area average over urban
areas only. The urban area average is also derived for the national no-vegetation runs, but calculated over all grid cells for which
the urban landcover types jointly account for at least 50%. wb dust: windblown dust from desert soil. BSOA: biogenic secondary
organic aerosol.
