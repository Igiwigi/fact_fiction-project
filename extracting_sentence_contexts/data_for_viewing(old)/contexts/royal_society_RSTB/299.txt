tively larger, being about one-fifth of the length of the head, while in S. Purdoni
is only about one-eighth. In the latter, also, the cerebellum is smaller, and the op!
lobes larger, than in Hesperornis. Although the optic lobes of Hesperornis are wi
seen from above, yet they do not seem to reach the upper surface of the brain ; whi
in S. Pwrdoni they form no inconsiderable part of the upper surface, and are as hi;
as, if not higher than, the cerebrum itself.

The endeavour to trace the affinities of fossil animals is constantly leading us ini
unexpected difficulties and seeming incongruities. These difficulties, no doubt, ari
sometimes from our want of knowledge, but often also from our inability to rightl
interpret the known facts, which are only too frequently few in number, and serv
rather to indicate the wide fields of knowledge yet to be searched than to furni
materials from which to draw definite conclusions. The organisation of the Ptero
sauria presents us with some of these difficulties.

The comparisons which have been made will, I think, make it clear that the
Pterosaurian skull, as shown in Scaphognathus Purdont, has a very close affinity to
the skulls of Lacertilia in important points of structure, while the resemblances to
the Avian skull are only superficial, On the other hand, the brain of S. Purdoni
departs from the Reptilian type, and makes an approach towards the brain of Birds,
and more especially to the form found in the fossil Hesperornis and its allies. Accep-
ting these facts, about which there can be no doubt, the Pterosauria show close
affinities with both Birds and Reptiles. From an evolutionistâ€™s point of view, this
