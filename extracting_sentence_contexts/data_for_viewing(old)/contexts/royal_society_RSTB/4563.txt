a supposition which was to be further supported, in the very next year after it had
been advanced, by the appearance of new material of eel larvee from the open
Atlantic.

In a study published almost at the same time (1909)* on the ‘ Distribution of the
Fresh-water Eels throughout the World,’ I drew attention to the fact that the
distribution of the eels in the Atlantic area distinctly coincides with the periphery of
the great anti-cyclonic circulation of the water-masses in the North Atlantic.

The new material referred to—eel larvie from the open Atlantic Ocean—was derived,
partly from the cruise of the Norwegian 8.8. “ M. Sars” in the Atlantic, June—July,
1910, partly from some old collections of Leptocephali which had lain for many years
unexamined at the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen. Before proceeding to this
new material, I would call to mind that the eel larvee—nearly 800 in all—which I had
taken on board the “Thor” in 1905 and 1906 from the waters west of Europe,
averaged about 74cm, in length. The largest measured 88 mm. and the smallest
60 mm. (see graph, fig. 2, p. 184). As to determining the age of these larvee there
was nothing of any certainty to go upon.
