and is not comparable with the sac-like structure of the ovary in, for example, Sciliorhinus
or the anuran Amphibia. In other elasmobranchs the germinal epithelium covers the
outer surface of the ovary, and ripe follicles burst through this surface to discharge their
ova into the peritoneal cavity.

The immense number of follicles and small ova found in Cetorhinus is unusual; calculation
shows that the ovary contains at least six million ova measuring 0-5 mm. or more in
diameter, a number similar to that present in the ovaries of many oviparous teleostean fish.
Ova as small as 0-5 mm. in diameter already contain a considerable proportion of yolk,
but the largest yolky eggs found were not more than 5:0 mm. in diameter. It is probable
that this is the maximum size attained by the ova before discharge from the ovary, for it
appears to be impossible for anything larger to pass through the finer ramifications of the
internal cavity. The correctness of this conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the lumen
in the infundibular part of the oviduct is not greater than 2-0 to 3-0 mm. in diameter, so
that an egg even of the small size mentioned would undergo considerable distortion in
passing through it. The wall of this part of the oviduct is thick, fibrous and inelastic, so that
unless great changes take place in it at the period of ovulation the eggs almost certainly
cannot be larger when discharged.

The formation of the follicles from nests of cells is in general similar to the process in
other elasmobranchs, as described by Balfour (18784) and Ludwig (1875), but the formation
of vitelline material in the follicle cells during early stages and its transfer to the ovum do
not appear to have been described in other species, When all this material has been trans-
ferred so that the follicle cells form a comparatively thin layer of epithelium the component
cells are all of much the same size, as in Sciliorhinus, and do not show the great differences
