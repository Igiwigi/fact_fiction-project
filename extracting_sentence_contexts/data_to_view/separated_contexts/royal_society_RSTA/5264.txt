The observed changes have the structural form of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) in ig
its positive phase: the surface wind maximum, the storm tracks, and the edge of the Hadley : s
cell all shift poleward. While similar changes, with the same sign, have been reproduced in [gf

models under GHG warming scenarios (e.g. [23,24]) they are also found in response to imposed
ozone depletion (e.g. [25-28]). In fact, on the basis of GCM studies in which both forcings were
included, separately and together, it is believed that ozone depletion has been the primary
cause of the observed wind changes [29,30]. In the future, assuming ozone depletion weakens
as expected, the effects of GHG and ozone forcings may no longer act in the same sense on

surface winds. : =

Changes in the Southern Hemisphere westerlies (and SAM) have been linked to changes in : S
sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea-ice extent around Antarctica on interannual time scales 2
(e.g. [4,31-35]). A positive SAM induces an overall transient cooling through the enhanced Ekman : S
transport of cold surface waters northward from Antarctica promoting sea-ice growth.
