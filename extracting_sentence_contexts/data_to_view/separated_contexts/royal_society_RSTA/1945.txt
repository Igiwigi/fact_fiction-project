Performing a
linear stability analysis for such orbits is however complex. Indeed, upon buckling, the initially
straight fibre picks a specific trajectory among an infinite family. The selected trajectory depends
on the initial perturbation and is very sensitive to fine sub-leading details, such as thermal
noise [36], fibre or fluid inertia [37,38], or, as in our turbulent settings, the fact that the flow is
not a pure shear. As we will see in the sequel, a simplified linear stability analysis already fairly describes
buckling events, meaning that we can avoid delving into the complicated context of Jeffery orbits. Let us consider that the fibre experiences a time-constant compression 7 = p'A p <0 along its
direction.
