FROM ORDINARY DAYS OF THE ELEVEN YEARS 1890 TO 1900. 267

§, but in the group or groups with S above 80 the rate of increase seems reduced.
The exceptionally high monthly values of S occurred sporadically. For instance, the
extreme value, 129°2 in August 1893, was preceded by 88°8 in July and followed by
77'9 in September. Thus we should not expect a correspondingly high value of R
unless the influence of previous months is negligible.
In considering the significance of Table XLV. allowance should be made for the fact
that some of the groups come entirely from years of sunspot maximum. No value of
S as high as 60 occurred in the sunspot minimum or intermediate years. Again,
sunspot minimum years gave no value of § larger than 205, and so their contributions
a were practically confined to the groups 0 to 10 and 10 to 20. Intermediate years
a contributed only two months to the group 0 to 10, and six to the group 10 to 20.
3 $28. We have hitherto considered only mean monthly values of R’, but the way in
2 which these values are made up seems also of interest. To make the results more
a” complete, D has been included in the investigation. Some data for D were got out
in a previous paper,* but they are considerably extended here. As a preliminary it
Si is well to know something about the extreme values of R’. To thisend Tables XLVI.
