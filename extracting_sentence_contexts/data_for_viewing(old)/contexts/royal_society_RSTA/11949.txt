black used in these experiments originally contained 111 — 46°5 = 64°5 volumes
oxygen. The low initial absorptive power of this sample of platinum black
accounted for by the fact that it had previously been used for another set of exper
ments, and had been charged alternately with hydrogen and oxygen. q
Starting with platinum black containing 64°5 volumes of oxygen at the ordinai
temperature (17°) the following table shows the amount of oxygen absorbed o
heating at different temperatures in an atmosphere of oxygen.
