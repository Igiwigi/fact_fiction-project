atmosphere, well lighted and heated, a great number of large intumescences are
formed in a couple of days. The importance of uminaiion in Hibiscus is shown by the fact that intumescences
will form under clear glass, red, yellow, and white-washed glass, but not under blue
or green glass, nor in a poor light, nor in darkness. But in some later experiments
with Populus tremula, Kistrrâ€™s* results seem to show that light is not necessary in
all cases: these exceptional results will be examined subsequently. Again, a high temperature is necessary in the case of Hibiscus, but not in that of
Populus tremula.
