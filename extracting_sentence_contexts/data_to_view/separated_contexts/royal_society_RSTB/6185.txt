220 R. A. FISHER ON DOMINANCE IN POULTRY

Only one foot was of type B which has evidently been quite rare in the later years of
the experiment. The two feet of the,same bird are usually similar, but the different types are not
equally frequent on the two sides. Bonp (1920) has emphasized the fact that when
there is asymmetry, polydactyly is more fully developed on the left foot than on the
right. In confirmation of this I find that all seven of the normal feet found on
polydactyl birds were on the right side, paired in five cases with type C, and in
two cases with type D. On the other hand, asymmetry of birds having five bones
on one side and three on the other is, in my material, equally frequent in both
directions. In addition to the feet of birds recognizably polydactyl, there would
in a complete census be at least a few cases in which both feet were normal, or of
type A, and these would somewhat lower the average number of bones.
