Nevertheless,
both proposals were based on accurate observations and premises that were correct enough to
withstand the test of time and to be built upon by those who followed.

4. Darwin's theory

A key property that the theory of evolution shares with Mendeleev’s periodic table is that it
is based on observed facts. Darwin’s virtue, and the key to his success, was his remarkable
command of the diverse facts that define the natural history of plants and animals, living and
extinct. Darwin organized these facts to propose a process, natural selection, to explain how
species change over time. It is not mere speculation about how species form.
