But precisely at that point, where the sudden flexure of the
cranial walls occur, there is an easy way into the anterior compartment of the nasal
capsule, through which the nerve may have passed. : The posterior opening of the cranial cavity, corresponding to the occipital foramen,
is not completed by a roof, a fact rendered all the more remarkable by the presence,
immediately behind it, of the neural arch of the first vertebra, still retaining its
original position with regard to the skull or only slightly displaced to a lower level,
although the body of the vertebra has been separated from it, and turned over so as
to lie on its articular face. The arch is far from well preserved, however, and is
usually in a very fragmentary condition. The absence of an occipital arch in the

fossil does not necessarily prove that it was not present in the organism; the
apparently capricious way in which parts are preserved in ene specimen and not in
another, offers a warning against putting too much faith in merely negative evidence ;
the number of specimens we have examined in which the dorsal surface was
embedded in the rock, and, therefore, most likely to be well preserved, is not great,
(some six or seven in all), and with regard to these it must be borne in mind that if
the organism came finally to rest on its ventral surface, the upper part of the skull
would be the last to be covered up with sediment, and would thus be the longest
exposed to oxidising and destructive action.
