In particular, the fact that the pulse train is asymptotic to zero makes it possible to apply the
Fourier transform along the propagation axis (i.e. in the time domain) with periodic boundary
conditions. Solving equation (3.2) in Fourier space and transforming back to the time domain
yields a simple expression of the mapping operator

An =F UL(o) FHAn—)D, (3.3)

where F; denotes the Fourier transform in time and L(w)=(1+iw/y)! is the Lorentzian
function. The fact that equations of the same type as equation (3.2) could be solved by a Fourier
method as a functional mapping in the long delay limit was already pointed out in [36] for the case
of a single variable. Applying Fourier transformation in the transverse plane yields the following
form of the functional mapping:

An = FrML()FF (Me? Fy (e8 ie Gra 2g) Qu-1/2+16 4,1}, (3.4)

with the carrier profiles G,;_; and Q,—1 that can be deduced from the field distribution A,_1.
