The phenomena
were not peculiar to a single station, but were found to correspond in localities most
distant from each other: nor were they confined to one only of the magnetic elements,
but were exhibited by all, each element having its own distinct instrumental means of
measurement. 'They were therefore recognized as the indication of a magnetic affection
common to the whole of our globe, constituting a periodical variation in the amount of
disturbance in different years. In 1851 and 1852 the annual ratios of disturbance were
found to be everywhere decidedly on the decrease, the epoch of maximum appearing to
have taken place in 1848-1849. The evidence of the existence of a decennial variation
appearing to be thus complete, its aunouncement, as a fact of which the knowledge was
acquired by a process of investigation specially designed for the discoyery of any such
periodical variation, if one should exist, was on the point of taking place, when a fortu-
nate incident (the receipt from M. vs HuMBoLDr of a proof-sheet of his * Kosmos,” con-
taining the first publication of HopraTy ScawaBr's Table of the variations of the solar
spots from 1826 to 1850) brought to my knowledge the existence of a corresponding
variation in the physical aspect of the sun, precisely similar in period and epochs to
the terrestrial magnetic variation, The importance of a revelation which gave a present

apparent connexion, and presented the promise of establishing a permanent connexion,

between the preyiously isolated terrestrial magnetic phenomena and the physical affec-

tions of the central body of our system, could not well be overrated. It was not alone

the cosmical character which it imparted to a single terrestrial magnetic variation other-

wise unconnected and inexplicable,—but there could scarcely fail to be impressed on the


242 MAJOR-GENERAL SABINE ON THE DISTURBANCES OF THE

mind of every reflecting magnetician the possibility, almost amounting to probability,
that the second system of the terrestrial magnetism, which by the change in its rela-
tions to geographical space seemed to be distinct and dissevered from the magnetism of
the earth properly 80 called (7. e. the collective action of all the permanent magnetic
particles of the earth's mass, having its eat in the earth itself), might, like the decen-
nial variation, be in truth assignable to a cosmical origin. The movement of translation
on the earth's surface of the second system, and with it the whole phenomena of the
Secular change, would thus be regarded as belonging to, or being part of, a comical
variation.
