Downtonian and its upper beds were quite probably fresh water. That the Dittonian,
in which no marine animals have been found, were probably fresh-water deposits is
a view that has been expressed by geologists. The Senni Beds would represent a stage
some time after the establishment of continental conditions; this is in accord with their
lithological characters, for the impersistent conglomeratic bands, false-bedding and
ripple-marking all point to fluviatile deposition in shallow water. The evidence of the
few animal remains (Pteraspis dunensis, Cephalaspis sp. and a Eurypterid) found in the
Senni Beds points in the same direction, and that provided by the plants, or at least
the majority of them, shows that the flora as a whole had lived under terrestrial con-
ditions. It is not, of course, excluded that some of the forms from the Downtonian to the
Senni Beds may have been aquatic or marsh plants. But, even in the case of the earlier
floras, the presence of vascular plants with firm-walled and presumably air-borne
spores and the fact that some of the spores were shed from sporangia that had special
arrangements for dehiscence are indications of subaerial life. The evidence for a
definitely terrestrial habitat becomes still stronger in the case of the larger plants of
the Senni Beds. In South Wales the change indicated by the appearance of these
plants occurs at the base of the Senni Beds and within a few hundred feet of rock with
no stratigraphical break. It seems clear that the change in the flora here is not
evolutionary but ecological. It can be correlated with the alterations in the physical
conditions indicated by the increase of sandy over muddy sediments and by the decline
in the fish fauna.

Very special interest attaches to the continued presence in the Senni Beds, along
with the large and definite terrestrial vascular plants, of the peculiarly organized
Nematophytales (Prototaxites, Nematothallus). Nematothallus is abundant and readily
