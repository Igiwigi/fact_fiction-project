Beyond the obviously altered relation in the degree of representation which these
inovements bear to one another when primarily represented and when arranged in the
3 order of the number of total representation, 7.e., all muevements observed, there is
nothing further to be remarked upon this point, save to mention that this small degree
of primary representation is found, as might be expected, just in the middle of the
lower limb area, 2.e., around and especially in front of the upper part of the fissure of
Roianvo. REPRESENTATION OF THE MoveMENTS oF THE KNEE (Plate 41, fig. 12).

(i.) Total or Absolute Representation.—Movement of the knee occurs in order of
decreasing frequency at the centres :—

8 te {71 } +70, 73° {ei} out rh 59 (7 8 {7}
6! 6

a The knee is thus represented all over the entire lower limb area, the total number of

movements observed being 141 (¢/: Ankle). Further on we shall draw attention to the fact that the movements of the knee are

essentially dependent upon those of the hip.
(ii.) Primary Representation.—The knee we have observed to move primarily only
ten times, i.e. sth of the total primary movements of all the segments of the lower

limb. And, moreover, of these ten times, in four it was associated with other synergic
Consequently its réle as a joint of

primary movements, i.e., of hip and other joints.
primary movement is most insignificant, and we shall return to this question in

discussing the representation of “ purposive” actions of the limb. MDCCCLXXXVIIL-—B, 2G
