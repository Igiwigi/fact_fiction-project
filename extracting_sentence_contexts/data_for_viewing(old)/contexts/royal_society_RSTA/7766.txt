RADIO OBSERVATIONS DURING THE POLAR YEAR 1982-33 253

but unfortunately no daily measurements on atmospherics were made at Slough
during the Polar Year. We do not feel justified in concluding that there is very
little connexion between thunderstorm activity and abnormal Region E reflexion
as the thunderstorm figures used during the Polar Year referred to 13.00-18.00 G.M.T.,
while the Region E measurements were made at noon. It appears, however, that
the connexion is not a simple one, because on several recent occasions at Slough no
abnormal Region E reflexion has been obtained while a thunderstorm was passing
overhead. We feel bound to interpret the high correlation for the early part of
1932 as being possibly due to the fact that the quantities under comparison have a
very marked seasonal correspondence rather than agreement in their day-to-day
fluctuations. The latter point could not be tested properly as the observations were
made at weekly intervals. The Polar Year results certainly indicate that day-time
abnormal Region E reflexion occurs most frequently in the summer months when
local thunderstorms are at a maximum, but a marked connexion between the two
phenomena on particular days is lacking. It seems as if no decisive answer can be
given concerning their inter-dependence until a comparison has been made between
atmospherics recorded and abnormal Region E reflexion over the 24 hours of the
day. We hope that the data required for this comparison will be available in the
near future.
