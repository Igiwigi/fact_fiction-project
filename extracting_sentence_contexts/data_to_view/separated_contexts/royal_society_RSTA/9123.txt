QUILD ON THE COLORIMETRIC PROPERTIES OF THE SPECTRUM. Maxwetw’s results indicate that the spectrum he employed was very impure, particu-
larly in the blue-green part of the spectrum. This gave an entirely fictitious approxi-
mation of the spectrum locus to two sides of the colour triangle and led MaxwE Lt to
conclude that “... all the colours of the spectrum may be compounded of those
which lie at the angles of this triangle,” and that there was “ strong reason to believe
that these are the three primary colours corresponding to those modes of sensation
in the organ of vision.”

These conclusions have long been known to be quite untenable, there being no spectral

colours which are in any sense Primary colours or from which all other colours can be

compounded. Determinations by other methods were made by Kén1c and Drererici* and by
Asney.t

Certain modifications in Kén1e’s data were made by Ivest to obtain better agreement
with luminosity relationships; and Weraver§ analysed the results of Kénie and
Drererict and ABNEY, reduced them to a common denominator, and obtained a set
of values based on them which was recommended for general use by the Colorimetry
Committee of the Optical Society of America in 1922 ; but, as far as the writer is aware,
no attempt has been made, since those of K6n1c and ABney, to obtain further experi-
mental information on the chromatic functions until quite recently. The tendency to elaborate and correct the meagre data of the earlier investigations,
rather than to initiate fresh experimental work on the subject under modern experi-
mental conditions, has no doubt been due to difficulties, supposed to be inherent in
such investigations, which have only been removed by the progress made on the
theoretical side of the subject during the last ten or fifteen years.
