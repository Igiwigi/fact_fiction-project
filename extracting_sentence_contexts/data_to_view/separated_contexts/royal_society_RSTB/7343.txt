For at their
extreme base the flanks of each leaf meet and unite, as already mentioned (p. 138), but
do not overlap. The greatest increase in the anodic arc of J, occurred in nos. 7 and 8, in which the angle
I-I, also showed the greatest increase above the normal. These facts suggested the possi-
bility that there might be some regular relationship between the increase in length of the
anodic halves of /, and the increase in the divergence angle [\-/,. This relationship is
shown on a graph (figure 10) in which the angle J,—J, is shown on the ordinates and the
angle subtended by the anodic half of J, on the abscissae. The graph shows clearly that
the arc of the anodic half of J, increases as the angle J,|—J, increases except in no. 3, in which
the anodic half is unduly small.
