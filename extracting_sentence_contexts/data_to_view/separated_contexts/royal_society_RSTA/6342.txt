Rainfall intensity, dry spell length and changes in effective rainfall due
to land cover changes and changes in rainfall interception [35] all contribute to the assessment of
recent droughts and their future projections [36,37] (see ยง6).

(b) The role of atmospheric evaporative demand in the assessment of drought trends

According to the results provided in ยง2, if there is a notion of certain increasing trends
in the severity of some drought types (ie. agricultural, ecological and hydrological) in the
last few decades, it must be related to factors other than precipitation, since meteorological
droughts do not show relevant changes on a global scale. These factors can be of two types: (i)
those resulting in changes in human water demands and land cover, which may increase the
effects of precipitation deficits on ecosystems and human societies and reinforce the negative
consequences of agricultural, ecological and hydrological droughts [38] and (ii) those resulting
from anthropogenic forcing as a consequence of the enhanced emission of greenhouse gases that
increase temperature and AED. In fact, both factors are not independent from each other, as land
cover change may affect land ET and AED [15], while an increased AED may also affect ET and
therefore the availability of water resources for other uses (e.g. reservoir storage) [36]. Here, we
discuss the second factor that is linked to the rise in temperature and AED, since the first factor is
very complicated and has strong regional differences. AED has strong agronomic and hydrological implications [37].
