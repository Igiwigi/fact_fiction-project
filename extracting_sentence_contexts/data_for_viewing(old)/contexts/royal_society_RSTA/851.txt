be simply cancelled out because in the interim tipping points are passed and more severe
climate effects are ratcheted in, such actions are outrageous. Why outrageous? Because worse
than merely knowingly passing off the costs of oneâ€™s own benefits to others, one is knowingly
passing off risks that are likely to compound and mushroom and may pass the limits of social
adaptation.

5. Poverty alleviation

The one decisive objection to more ambitious mitigation in fulfilment of intergenerational justice
would be its incompatibility with robust alleviation of poverty, which is a clear moral imperative
of international justice. So far, I have simply assumed that any efforts or sacrifices by current
generations could be fairly shared internationally. Is this actually true? Two entirely independent
considerations, one of principle and one of fact, strongly support the hypothesis that ambitious
mitigation and ambitious poverty eradication can be fully compatible.

With regard to principle, an admittedly now-dated study is still highly suggestive [25]. It
seems reasonable that those individuals whose emissions are the greatest, whatever their country,
should be the first to reduce their emissions (or, alternatively, pay for emissions reductions of the
same amount by others). If the income distributions of individuals in every country are converted
into emissions distributions using natural assumptions about elasticity, it turned out, using 2003
data, that a global reduction in emissions of 13 GtCO2 in 2030 would require reductions in
emissions by only the 1.13 billion high emitters from all regions of the world, which was less
than 15% of the projected 2030 global population [25].

Obviously, the total amount of the global reduction in emissions ought to be set with reference
