matured leaf these two bundles obyiously subdivide to form the well-known venation
of the Salisburta,

Seeing that this twin development of the foliar bundles appears to be limited,
amongst living Conifers, to the Salisburia, in which plant it 8eems to hold a definite
relationship to the peculiar multinerved structure and Adiantiform contour of the leaf,
may we not recognize the probability that our British carboniferous Dadozylons bore
some remote genetic relations to the living Gingko? No such duplex leaf-bundle
appears to have been detected in any of the fine examples of Cordaites and their allies
discovered by M. Granp-'Eury in the St. Etienne deposits. This Salisburian form
8eems to be confined to our British Dadozylons. That this similarity of contour in
the arrangement of the leaf-bundles is not merely accidental is rendered the more
probable by the fact that transverse sections of young twigs of the ancient and modern
plants display corresponding identities. Thus a section of the bark of a young
Dadozylont corresponds closely with the similar section of a Salisburia, fig. 28, in
both of which the bark is separated into an outer coarsely cellular periderm and an

inner one compozed of much more delicate elements. This observation applies to the

* The section was made in April.
