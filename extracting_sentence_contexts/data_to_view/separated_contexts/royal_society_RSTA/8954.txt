g (i.) Experimental Arrangements. BE In view of the fact that the sound-waves in the immediate neighbourhood of a fog-
3 signal generator are probably propagated as waves of finite amplitude with heavy
cs transmission losses, it was necessary to develop a method of measuring the actual
3 proportion of power converted into sound which would be independent of the theory
got the propagation of waves of small amplitnde and of propagation according to the
law of inverse squares.
— The principle of the method which was designed to accomplish this purpose may be
é ~~ briefly stated as follows. Imagine two thermometers inserted, one in the high-
8 pressure side, the other in the side open to the atmosphere, of a siren or other sound-
oh ied instrument operated by compressed air. If the air be allowed to escape
& without producing sound, there will be no fall of temperature as no external work is
A done by the escaping air (except for the negligibly small Joule-Thomson effect ; the
thermometers are supposed to be situated in regions of steady flow, free from eddy-
currents).
