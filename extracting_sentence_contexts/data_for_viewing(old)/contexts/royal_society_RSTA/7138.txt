We may assume that w’ = wo’ represents the product pq’ (by the induction hypothesis).
But then w* = w'c, = wo represents the product pq'g = pq, by lemma (2-2), and lemma (2°3)
follows.

It follows from this lemma that every element fe P is represented by at least one normal
word we. For the normal word w, — 1 evidently represents the unit element 1 « P; and
if = pd, then the normal word w — wo¢ represents the product 1p = pe P, by lemma (2:8).

Moreover, it follows that ¢ is in fact an isomorphism. For if f)¢ P is contained in the
kernel of ¢, that is, if py¢ is the unit element « of 2—the identical permutation of Y—and if
we represents the element pe P, then we = w represents the product p/o- But a word
w can only represent a single element of P; hence ppy = p and fy = 1.

Trorem (Schreier 1927). Every element pe P is represented by one and only one normal word
we. (2:4)

Proof. We have already seen that every fe P is represented by at least one normal word;
it only remains to show that / cannot be represented by more than one normal word. Ifnow
« — pd, then p is represented by w = woo, where again w) = 1€QB. Let w'eWW be another
normal word which represents the same element /, and let w’ = wya’—such a o’ exists
because of the transitivity of ; finally, let p’ be the original of o’ under ¢, so that a’ = p'¢;
