no one in England appears to have been aware that Dr. Enter had done any work in
connexion with the neryous system of Meduse. This ignorance is to be accounted
for by the fact that the journal in which Dr. Encer published his paper has but a very
limited circulation in this country, while of the paper itself no abstract appears in the
© Centralblatt.”

The following is a full abstract of the results and opinions set forth by the paper in
question. In Aurelia aurita the author observed that excision of the lithocysts was usually
followed by complete and permanent paralysis of the swimming-organ, while any tissue
left adhering to a lithocyst continued rhythmically to contract © like the excised heart
of a frog.” He appears, however, to be decidedly of the opinion that the seats of
spontaneity are not the lithocysts alone, but the entire crescent-shaped interruptions of
the margin in which the lithocysts are lodged (see Plate 32).
