114 Mr. W. Branve's Chemical Researches, &c.

afforded an excellent opportunity of corroborating the facts
respecting this principle, which have been detailed in the pre-
ceding pages. Although I could detect no traces of iron, by
the usual modes of analysis, minute portions of that metal
may, and probably do exist-in it, as well as in the other
animal fluids which I have examined ; but the abundance of
colouring matter in this secretion should have afforded a pro-
portional quantity of iron, did any connection exist between
them. It has been observed that the artificial solutions of the
colouring matter of the blood, invariably exhibit a green tint
when viewed by transmitted light: this peculiarity is remark-
ably distinct in the menstruous discharge.*

I hope that some of the facts furnished by the above expe-
riments, may prove useful to the physiological inquirer: they
account for the rapid reproduction of perfect blood after very
copious bleedings, which is quite inexplicable upon that hypo-
thesis which regards iron as the colouring matter, and may
perhaps lead to the solution of some hitherto unexplained
phenomena connected with the Å¿unction of respiration.
