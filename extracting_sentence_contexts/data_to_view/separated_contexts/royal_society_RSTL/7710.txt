The diseases which mainly operate in
8hortening human existence are yery fow in number; but could they be extirpated, the number of minor causes,
of nearly coordinate importance, which still would influence the rate of mortality would be very large. =

THE LAW OF ERRORS OF OBSERVATIONS. 179

this absolutely ; thus it is not enough for our purpose to show, could we do 80 conelusively,

that each error in practice is compounded of a large number of sgmaller errors; we must
also show that they are independent, at least for the most part. Thus we may conceive
one of the minute errors affecting an astronomical magnitude to be an error in the
refraction proceeding from a rise in the general temperature, and another affecting the
same observation to be an error of time arising from the expansion of the pendulum
through the same cause ; now these two minute errors are not independent, and would
have to be mathematically combined in quite a different way from two that were inde-
pendent; and, indeed, such a change of temperature would influence the actual error of
the observation in other ways also. However, we may at least safely conclude that the
hypothesis in question is not a mere arbitrary assumption, but a reasonable and probable
account of what does in fact take place in the case of careful and refined observations.
3. In proceeding to submit this hypothesis to mathematical analysis, the minute simple
errors which go to form the observed compound error will be assnmed to follow each
its own unknown law, expressed by different unknown functions of the utmost generality *:
positive and negative values of each error will not be assnmed equally possible; on the
contrary, the cases will be included, as obviously ought to be done, of minute disturbing
influences which always canse the observed magnitude to err in excess, and of others
which canse it to err only in defect. IT will exclude all mention of the term probadility,
and will consider solely the frequency or density of the error, viewed as a function of its
magnitude. ,

**Let any magnitude which has to be determined by observations affected with some

one cause of error (smple or compound) be represented by the line BA;

B 8 tonk D

let a large number of such observations be made, and let the observed values be repre-
sented by a number of lengths BA', measured from B': it will be found in general that
in the neighbourhood of A the line will be dotted over with a multitude of points A',
the distance AA' being the error in each case.
