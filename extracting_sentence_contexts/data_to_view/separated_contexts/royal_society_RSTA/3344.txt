In Avida, traits are snippets of code that allow the avidian to gain energy
from the environment, by performing logic operations on binary numbers that the environment
provides (see Methods). Replicators with the fg/gb motifs did evolve more novel traits than
replicators with the hc/rc motifs (figure 6d). In fact, only fg-replicators evolved traits in these
experiments. Finally, we looked at the effect of historical contingency when all 914 replicators
were competed against each other in one population. After 50000 updates, we identify the most
abundant genotype in 200 replicate experiments and reconstruct the line-of-descent to determine
which of the replicators gave rise to it (we call that replicator the ‘progenitor’).
