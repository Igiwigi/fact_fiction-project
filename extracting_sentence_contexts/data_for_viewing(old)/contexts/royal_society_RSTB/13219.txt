particular, the explicit nature of such models makes them rep-
resent very specific demographic scenarios, therefore care must
be taken that a wide range of plausible scenarios are rep-
resented in the analysis. Here it is especially important to
make sure that the considered models capture the key patterns
of variation observed in the data, for example using the
descriptive statistics and other tools described above on simu-
lated data from these models.

Despite their ability to explicitly represent a wide range of
demographic processes, so far only relatively few studies have
used spatially explicit models to reconstruct demographic his-
tory. This is probably due to the fact that such simulation
approaches can be complicated to set up and computationally
demanding to perform. Early studies used linear steppingstone
models to represent founder effects during the expansion of ana-
tomically modern humans out of Africa [88,89] and the levels of
shared genetic variation between humans and Neanderthals
[78]. Warmuth et al. [90] used a spatially explicit model of Eura-
sia to infer the origin and timing of horse domestication. The
SPLATCHE2 framework [91] uses a two-dimensional spatially
explicit model, which has been used to study interbreeding
between humans and Neanderthals [92]. Eriksson et al. [86]
used a global spatial model to link late Pleistocene human
demography to climate; this model was later used to test the
