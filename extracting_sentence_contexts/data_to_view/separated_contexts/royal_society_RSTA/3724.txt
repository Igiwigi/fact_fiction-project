The depiction of the transmission amplitude in the complex plane yields deeper
insight into the nature of the resonances. As theory and model results show, the transmission
amplitude performs a circle in the complex plane, and this circle appears rotated with respect
to the circle origin. This fact is due to the scattering phases and neighbouring resonances. The
influence of the different parameters on the appearance of the complex plot gives useful hints for
the design of optical elements. The samples show very high values around 90000 fs? for the GDD, which is a prerequisite
for a possible applications in dispersion compensation.
