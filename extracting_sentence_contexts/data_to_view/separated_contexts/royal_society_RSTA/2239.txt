The curvature is away from the axis of «x, so that dy/dx increases with «, and
@y/da? is positive. Thus n is less than unity. The curve is, in fact, not unlike the
two branches of a semi-cubical parabola, in which n = §. ‘This property of curvature
away from the axis is general throughout the plates, as a casual inspection shows, in
all regions where the curvature appears fairly continuous, and therefore determined
by only one or by several very close components in the primary broadened line. A
single component must therefore ultimately produce, after passage through the
wedge, a curve whose equation is at least approximately of the form

y" © x,
where n is less than unity.
