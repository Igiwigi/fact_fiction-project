This factor is almost independent of frequency for a considerable band in the
region of 8 to 9 sec., but if wave periods widely different from this value are present the
magnification factor estimated from the ‘mean wave period’ will certainly be too small. An estimate of the magnitude indicates, however, that this error can hardly exceed 10%
even under the most severe conditions encountered. The damping of the long-period
pendulums and the fact that their knife edges are above the axis of the gimbals will also tend
to cause a slight overestimate of the acceleration, but their combined effects cannot exceed
a few per cent. These errors account for part of the observed discrepancy but not all of it. SUBMARINE GRAVITY SURVEYS OF 1938 AND 1946 271
