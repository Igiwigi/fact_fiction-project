MINUTE ANATOMY OF THE PAPILLX OF THE FROG'S TONGUE. 453

The 80-called nuclei or masses of germinal matter in connexion with these fine mius-
cular fibres present several points which will well repay attentive study. These masses
of germinal matter are sometimes twice or three times the width of the fibre with which
they are connected. In a paper published in Part XIV. of my *Archives,” I have adduced
facts which render it probable that these nuclei or masses of germinal matter change
their position in a very remarkable manner during life. The conclusions I have arrived at upon this point are as follows :—

The masses of germinal matter appear to move along the surface of the already-formed
muscular tissue, and as they move part of their substance becomes converted into muscle
(Plate XXII. fig. 13). Tt is in this way that new muscle is formed and new muscular

Aissue is added to that already produced.
