Pharmacological challenge tests (here called Approach 2)
have also been adopted from psychiatry and follow a similar
approach as above, but use a biochemical drug response as a
marker of a hidden disposition of susceptibility of a tempe-
rament trait. That is, they serve as a diagnostic tool for
detecting a disposition, which is invisible in unstimulated
conditions, just like an allergy test. They make use of the fact that TMs in the limbic system
act on hypothalamic peptide-releasing hormones, which
induce pituitary hormones such as prolactin (PRL), growth
hormone (GH) and glandotropic hormones like ACTH, lead-
ing to cortisol release. These hormones can be measured in
blood or saliva and can serve as indicators of TM activity
(electronic supplementary material, S1). Examples of chal-
lenges of the three most behaviourally relevant TM systems
DA, 5-HT and NE [31 p. 654] (electronic supplementary
material, S2) demonstrated that each of these three systems
can be manipulated at several steps from synthesis to degra-
dation, that in many cases the same drug may elicit several
different hormone responses, and that the systems can be tar-
geted by drugs related to different receptor subtypes, and by
agonistic and antagonistic procedures (for more thorough
reviews, see [32]).
