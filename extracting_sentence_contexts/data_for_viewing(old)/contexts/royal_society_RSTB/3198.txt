into which the ridges of the trophoblast fit. The attachment at this stage is so
slight that great difficulty is experienced in keeping the blastocyst in si¢w during
preparation, The next stage, however, shows conclusively the true relation between
the blastocyst or uterine wall.

A section taken parallel to the long axis cuts the ridges and furrows at right
angles. This is the case with the series of sections of one of which text-fig. 4 is a

drawing. This is a section through one of the thickened ridged areas of a blastocyst,
and I wish to draw especial attention to the fact that the ridges are more of the
nature of folds than of local thickenings. To some small extent this may be due to
crumpling as a result of the method of application of the preserving fluid.

A section, however, of the uterine cotyledonary burr (text-fig. 5) shows the sulci
just as plainly as the ridges appear upon the blastocyst wall.

The trophoblast cells are nearly all crowded with proteid material—the rod-like
