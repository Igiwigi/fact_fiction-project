Here we are able to compare directly the two cases of the relieving tinfoil
\Heing on the tube, and at a distance from it. And we find that there is no difference
| Þ favour of the latter in the luminous phenomena of relief thereby produced. Hence
Se are fairly entitled to conclude that the positive discharge passes off in a time shorter
San that required for positive electricity to advance along the tube, and that in 80
"Hoing positive luminosity is formed by it as it goes.*
© Bo far we have nothing that would lead us to draw a distinction in time between the
-gmission of electricity and the formation of the luminous phenomena which accompanies
; emission, But when we take the correlative phenomena for negative discharge, 1.e.,
| blank-space, a difficulty arises, It not only must, from its nature, be formed in
| same time as the positive laminosity which it limits, but all the phenomena of
Revocation testify to the fact that it is 80. But we have already shown that negative
- discharge does not take place with a rapidity at all comparable with that of positive
4 discharge, 80 that we can no longer view the formation of the blank-space simply

* It is doubtless owing to this extreme rapidity of discharge and propagation that thore is 80 much
- luminosity and «0 little beat in the vacuum discharge. Tt has been experimentally shown that the tem-
perature of strim is not greater than 100*.
