single spherule ; but in this arrangement; for want of similar
matter at the poles of this circle, the equilibrium would be
unstable, and would. be liable to be deranged by the slightest
force of adjacent combinations ; but when the number of one
set of particles exceeds in the proportion of four to one, then,
on the contrary, a stable equilibrium may again take place, if
the four particles are situated at the angles of the four equi=
lateral triangles composing a regular tetrahedron.

But as this geometrical arrangement of the primary ele-
ments of matter is altogether; conjectural, and must rely for
its confirmation.or rejection upon future inquiry, I am desirous
that it should not be confounded with the results of the facts
and observations related aboye, which are sufficiently distinct
and satisfactory, with respect ;to, the existence of the law of
simple multiples, , It is perhaps. too much. to hope, that the
geometrical arrangement of primary particles will ever be
perfectly known ; since even admitting that a very small
number of these atoms combining together would have a
tendency to arrange themselves in the manner I have ima=-
gined ; yet, until it is ascertained how small a proportion the
primary particles themselves bear to the interval between
them, it .may, be supposed that surrounding combinations,
although themselves analogous, might disturb that arrange-
ment, and in that case, the effect of such interference must
