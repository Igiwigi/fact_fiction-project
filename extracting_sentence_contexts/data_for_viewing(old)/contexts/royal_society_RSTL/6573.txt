over almost the whole length of the arc), in which respect, and in its duration, it differs
from the light of the spark proper*. With aluminium opposed to another metal, as
copper or iron, the green light is seen only when the aluminium is positive, Even with
aluminium this light may generally be got rid of by making the electrodes approach ;
and it is the arc in what may thus be deemed its normal state that was observed for the
construction of the last line of fig. 1, though IT have not at present noticed yariations in
the invisible corresponding with those in the visible spectrum of the arc discharge.

On the Cause of the Advantage of Broad Electrodes ; and on the Heating of the
Negative Electrode.

Although the spark appears instantaneous when viewed in a moving mirror, it must
yet, occupy a certain time; 80 that we have in fact a brief electric current, to which we
may apply Onw's laws, The electromotive force is here the difference of tensions of
the coatings of the jar. As to the resistance, the short metallic part of the circuit may
be neglected, and we need only attend to the place of the discharge. The resistance
here may be divided into that due to the air and that due to the parts of the electrodes
close to the points of discharge. That the latter is by no means insignificant, may be
inferred from the enormous temperature to which minute portions of the electrodes are
raised, as indicated by the excessively high refrangibility of the rays emitted by the
metals, in the state doubtless of vapour. By the use of flat electrodes the striking-
distance is materially diminished, without any change in the difference of tension of the
coatings of the jar. Hence the electricity which it contains passes at a higher yelocity,
and therefore produces a more powerful effect on the metals.
