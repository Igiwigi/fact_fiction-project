prominence is observable in the centre of the disc. The pupils are large and round
and only act moderately to light and mydriatics. Continued exposure to daylight
causes blindness. No choroidal vessels can be seen in the fundus, nor are any retinal
vessels discernible. Microscopic examination of the eyes of the Fruit-bats as well
as those of the English Bat show, that the vascularisation of the retina is restricted to
capillaries only. This condition seems to denote a very low degree of development,
because we have to descend very far down the scale before we meet with it again.
Some of the Sub-ungulates, a few Rodents, and the Edentata are the only other
placental Mammals similarly devoid of retinal vessels. Is this primitive condition of
the eye of the Bats due to arrested development or partial degeneration of that
particular organ through disuse, or must we regard it as disputing the high rank
which zoologists have assigned to these strange Mammals? Typical Vespertilionse
are undoubtedly met with in the Eocene epoch, a fact which favours the view that
the Bats are really a low, although in many respects a highly-specialised, order. (See

In Erinaceus europaeus (Common Hedgehog) the fundus is light grey in colour and
uniform all over. The disc is red, and four straight retinal vessels radiate from its
centre, throwing off a few branches ; no veins can be seen accompanying the arteries.
The pupil is small and round. ,

I examined the eye of the Common Mole (Talpa europea) immediately after
death, by removing the front part of the eye, and placing the posterior half under
