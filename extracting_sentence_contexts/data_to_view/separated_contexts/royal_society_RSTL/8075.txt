Society on the 17th'of May 17 53. takes notice, that
as the eledtrical attraction has been obſeryed ſo early,
as to be mentioned by Theophraſtas ; ſo its luminous
appearance, tho' only confidered as a_ meteor, i3
mentioned by Plutarch in his life of Lyſander, Pliny,
and, other \antient as well as ſome modern authors. Seneca. particularly affirms, - that, Gylyppo, Syracuſas
petenti viſa eſt frella ſuper -ipſam lancem conftitiſſe :
And that in Romanorum caftris viſa ſunt ardere pila,
ignibus ſeilicet in illa delapſis: | Czar, in his hiſtory
of the African war, ſays, in a violent ſtormy night, -
Legionis pilorum cacumina ſua ſponte arſerunt : And
Livy mentions two fimilar facts. Totheſe I ſhall
now add one from Mr. Fynes Moryſon, a writer
of unqueſtionable authority, and eminent for his
learning, curioſity, and ten years travels through moſt
countries of Europe, and part of Aſia.
