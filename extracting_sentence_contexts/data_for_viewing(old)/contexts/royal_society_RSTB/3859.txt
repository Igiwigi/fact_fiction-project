loculi, it is easy to show that depletion of starch takes place in older flowers, and
the oldest may show not a trace of starch left, but a shrivelled empty mass of
cells (Hooker, 1864). Other flowers may show depletion of an apical region first,
which apparently acts as a collecting organ in which conversion into sugar is
completed, and the fluid is discharged from the tip of the nucellus. That is to
say, the great storage of gyneecial starch is undoubtedly for a nectary function,
and the secretion is discharged vid the stylar tube on the surface of the stigmatic
dise. As in the case of the ovulate flower, it is abundantly clear that no useful
secretion can take place from the outer epidermis of the integument, since it would
never reach the exterior, and no secretion takes place from the cuticularised walls
of the cells lining the tube, while no extensive secretion can take place from the
curiously thickened papillose cells of the stigmatic dise, although they may contain
numerous small starch granules. In fact, the significance of the slight starch-
storage in the thick-walled epidermis lining the tube and the papillose cells of
the stigmatic dise is probably to be again regarded as a response to the conditions
to which they will be exposed when a strong solution of plasmolytic sugar is poured
over them.*

* These curiously protected papillose cells may possibly be regarded as modified in connection with the

visits of insects, which lick the rough surface which carries the exudation of the “ stylar ” canal. It is

also possible that such pseudo-xerophytie structure may be correlated with the overflow of strong
