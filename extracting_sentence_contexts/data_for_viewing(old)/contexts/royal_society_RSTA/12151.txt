in any direction without change of dimensions sideways, and that its potential en
if elastically isotropic is of the same form as the above, with the addition of
terms which, integrated over the volume, are equivalent to a surface integral.
remaining coefficient of elasticity, that is the rigidity, must then be the same in

waves may be transmissible at all through a heterogeneous medium of this type.
_ As an illustration of this somewhat abstract discussion, let us conduct the variation

it would be illegitimate for the present purpose to replace the potential energy by a
urface part and a volume part, because then it would not be correctly located in the
medium. We obtain on the left-hand side the time-integral of the expression
