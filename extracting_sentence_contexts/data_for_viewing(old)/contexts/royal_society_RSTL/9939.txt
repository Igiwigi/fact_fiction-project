without manure there was a decline in the second 10 years compared with the first,
there was with the mineral manure a considerable increase over the later period.

Of leguminous herbage there was not nearly 80 mnch actual increase of weight by
the mineral manure as there was of the gramineous ; but the proportional increase was
much greater, there being more than four, times as much grown with the mineral
manure as without manure, and there was also more over the second period than over
the first.

Of miscellaneous herbage there was very little increase by the manure, and a falling
off in actual amount over the later years.

The facts relating to the nitrogen bring out more strikingly the characteristic effects
of the mixed mineral manure in fayouring the development of leguminous species. The

figures given on page 309 show that whilst the percentage of nitrogen in the miscel-
laneous herbage is not much higher than that in the gramineous, the percentage in the
leguminous herbage is very much higher ; in fact, not far from twice as high. The
result is that, although there is by the mineral manure a greater increase in gramineous
than in leguminous hay, a larger proportion of the increase of nitrogen is due to the
leguminous than to the gramineous herbage ; whilst the miscellaneous herbage con-
tributes practically none of the increased yield of nitrogen. Again, whilst in the
