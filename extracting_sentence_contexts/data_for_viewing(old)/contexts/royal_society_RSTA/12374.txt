& From Table V. it is seen that from the extreme violet end of the spectrum, to
No. 14:5, the luminosities of extinction are practically the same ; in fact the curve at
is part is horizontal ; the same is the case with regard to the part between scale
SNo. 61'S and the extreme red end of the spectrum.
* This seems to confirm the view that the colour sensation of the eye for each of
‘ghese parts is a simple one. These results have been, as already said, incorporated
= Tables IIT. and IV.
2 In the diagrams, fig. 41, two curves of extinction are given. One shows what
“proportion of the beam, at different parts of the spectrum, is just not visible to the
central portion of the eye, the other, the curve with regard to the whole eye. These
curves correspond with each other, except where the absorption by the yellow spot
takes place. The part of the retina which appears most sensitive to the light of this
part of the spectrum is about 20° below the centre, and about 45° from the vertical
line. The light is certainly most persistent at this point.
