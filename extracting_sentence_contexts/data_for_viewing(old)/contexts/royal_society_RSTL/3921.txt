The only salt of mercury adapted to these inquiries is the chloride. Half the usual
equivalent of it (17'1 grains) and of the potash solution gave, in three experiments,
09:90, 0*:86 and 0:89, which, all corrections made and the final results doubled, cor-
respond to 189, 181 and 1*87. I have not been able to confirm this result by
precipitating the oxide from any other salt. The bromide has too little solubility in
cold water. The cyanuret is not decomposed by potash, and accordingly, no heat is
produced when their solutions are mixed. That the potash has not decomposed the
salt is further proved by the circumstance, that on neutralizing it with an acid, the
same increment of temperature occurred as if the alkali had been in a free state.
The sulphate and nitrate are both decomposed when their solutions are diluted. It
has indeed been lately asserted that a solution of the nentral nitrate may be obtained
by precipitating the chloride with nitrate of silver. This is a mistake, as the usual
decomposition occurs in this case. In fact, the solution of the supposed neutral
nitrate, instead of the acid reaction of the chloride from which it is formed, intensely
reddens litmus paper. If a similar experiment be made with other metallic chlorides,
capable of forming neutral nitrates, no perceptible change of reaction will be found
to occur, These observations fully explain the anomalies which I formerly pointed
out in the action of the dilute acids on the red oxide of mercury.
