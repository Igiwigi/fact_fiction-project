It is note-
worthy that this steep portion coincides with the other two primary inhibition curves
shown in the figure. After a minute or so the secondary inhibition comes into play,
and the pigmentomotor apparatus, released from inhibiting impulses, induces the
proximal migration of the melanophore pigmentâ€”slowly, as it does when an animal
is taken from light to darkness. It is a very remarkable fact that an exactly similar response of animals brought from
darkness into light on a white background has been observed by PARKER and Lan-
CHESTER (1922) in fishes. Fundulus, when taken from a dark box, were pale. They
were placed on a white background in full daylight.
