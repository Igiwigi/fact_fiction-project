[41,42] can be consistent with the de Sitter constraint.

The de Sitter criterion also has implications for late time cosmology. As argued in [43], it
implies that Dark Energy cannot be a cosmological constant, and it also constrains quintessence
models [44], although the constraints are still consistent with current observations.

The Ekpyrotic scenario [19,20], one of the alternatives to inflation, is characterized by a period
of super-slow contraction which is obtained by assuming that the dominant form of matter
is a scalar field g with a steep negative exponential potential. Such exponential potentials are
uniquitous in string theory constructions (see e.g. [45]). For example, the radius r of one of iS
the extra spatial dimensions of string theory yields a scalar field g via an exponential relation iS
g/mp1 ~ exp(r/I;), and hence a power-law potential energy function for the radion r leads to an 1S
exponential potential for g. The fact that a negative sign arises is related to the fact that the ground {=
state in superstring theory is typically AdS. The steepness of the potential is consistent with the 8
de Sitter criterion, as a generalization of the derivation of the de Sitter constraint to the case of :=
negative potentials has shown [39]. i=

In inflationary cosmology, the physical wavelength of cosmological fluctuations increases [By
exponentially. Hence, if the phase of inflation lasts sufficiently long, then length scales :
corresponding to those which are currently measured in CMB anisotropy experiments and large- [8
scale structure surveys originate at the beginning of the period of inflation with a physical length 2S
smaller than the Planck length. In this case, it is clear that an EFT description of the origin and ,
evolution of these fluctuations must break down [46,47]. Motivated by these considerations, very
