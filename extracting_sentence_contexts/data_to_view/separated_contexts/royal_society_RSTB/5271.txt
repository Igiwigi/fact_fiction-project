The third part supplies the
choroidal plexus and the cerebellum. The second parts are related to the rootlets
of the fifth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth nerves, proximal to the longitudinal
plexus on the restiform body, or, more correctly, the region of the rhombic lip. In
human anatomy there is an impression that only three of these arteries supply the
cerebellum, and on account of the fact that this appearance is warranted, if only the
sites of origin of the arteries are used for nomenclature, it is desirable to retain the
description for practical purposes. The condition in Echidna, however, makes it clear
that these arteries in virtue of their relations to the nerves have as much right to a
special name as the internal auditory artery. This was recognised by Hormann in his
important paper, where he describes a series of cerebellar branches and the relations of
the arteries to the nerves in various animals.
