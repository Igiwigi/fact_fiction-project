a second nucleus may be discerned. The parent cells are filled with a fluid which is
perfectly devoid of granules and molecules. This fluid has an obviously pink or
faint red tinge. From the contrast between their own colour and that of the fluid
(opalescent) in which they float, the cells become beautifully conspicuous objects;
but in the Sipunculidz and Holothuriadz these bodies are s0 numerous as to impart
to the fluid, viewed as a whole, a thick, milky pink appearance. The organic
quality of this fluid in these orders, at all events, it is impossible to doubt ; nor can it
be disputed for a moment, that the cavity in which it is contained in the Vermigrade
Echinoderms corresponds, nay, is anatomically identical, with that which holds the
Less opake and less organized peritoneal fluids of the Asteriadze, Echinidz, Ophi-
uridz and Ophiocomidze. In these orders, severally, it is the same fluid, chemically
and physiologically. In all it occupies the peri-visceral or peritoneal chamber. These
indisputable facts establish conclusively the view which denominates the peritoneal
fluid of Asterias, even though it may look like pure water, as a vitally endowed fluid.
In addition to the bodies above described, which are the proper corpuscles of the
chylaqueous fluid in Sipunculus Harveii and S. Johnstoni, others may be observed in
every specimen and at every season of the year, which severally resemble germ-cells
and sperm-cells*.

* I have designedly avoided in the text all discussion as to the real character of these ova- and spermato-

zoa-like bodies. which are constantly found in the chylaqueous fluid of nearly all zoophytic, radiate and STLOUIRISL
animals. In another communication I propose to contribute materials which will probably set the question at
