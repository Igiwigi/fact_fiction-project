The oxygen fugacity being close to IW can be explained by Iris forming in a high dust/gas
environment where evaporated pre-existing silicate dust contributes oxygen to the gas phase. The
MELTS results show that the bulk sodium content of Iris started with Na2O = 3.5 wt% and 40% of
the Na was lost during cooling from the melt in an open system behaviour for Na. Na is volatile
and the fact that only 40% of the Na was lost means that the ambient partial pressure of Na was
near equilibrium, which is commensurate with a dust enrichment of approximately 104 [14,202]. A second Stardust chondrule ‘Callie’ consists mainly of olivine (Fa36-Fa41) and Callie also
contains Na-rich feldspar (plagioclase) [14]. A third Stardust chondrule ‘Torajiro’ [203] consists
mainly of olivine (Fal9-Fa20), low-Ca pyroxene (En86Wo3), small kamacite blebs (Fe, Ni-
metal found in meteorites), and glass enriched in SiO2 and AljO3 [14].
