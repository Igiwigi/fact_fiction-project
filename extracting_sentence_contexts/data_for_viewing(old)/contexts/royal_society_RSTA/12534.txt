This is very exactly responded to by the hypothesis. Darron’s law of diffusion
belongs to media as a necessary and the most obvious consequence of the constitution
assigned to them (VI.) Dr. Granaw’s law of diffusive velocity or volume applies
also to media, because if placed in similar circumstances such an effect must depend
on the molecular velocity, which, singularly enough, bears exactly the like ratio to
their specific gravity (X.).

§ 15. In the first point of analogy it was stated the atomic weight of a gas
corresponded with its specific gravity, but with the reservation that the combining
proportions are simple multiples or quotients of the same. This appears to me to be
the fair statement of the remarkable connection that is always found between the
combining volume and combining weight. It seems impossible that the fact of a
volume of every gas containing the same number of molecules can ever be inductively

é established, but all analogy leads us to this conclusion. One volume of oxygen
= combines with two volumes of hydrogen to form two volumes of aqueous vapour. If
5 we inferred from this that one molecule of oxygen combined with two molecules of
3 hydrogen to form one of steam, we must admit that the molecule of steam occupies
g double the volume of a molecule of hydrogen or oxygen. If it is admitted, on the
is other hand, that the oxygen molecule is capable of disintegration, and that half a
8 molecule combines with one of hydrogen to form one of steam, the bulk of the three

molecules are equal. This last is the view that is responded to by the hypothetical
media. The objection to it is plausible from the natural repugnance to the idea of
