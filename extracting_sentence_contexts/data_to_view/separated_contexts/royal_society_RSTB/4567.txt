The groove on the posterior aspect has a specialised tissue, the nature of which is
obscure in its central portion, but near to each serrated margin is an area of epithelium
which in some sections shows as a true follicle, and lies close to the base of a deunticle. FOSSIL, AND THE GLANDULAR STRUCTURE IN CONNECTION THEREWITH. 17

This epithelial patch does not seem sufficient in extent or depth to justify the assump-
tion of the possession of a special function, and further research on the point is
necessary. The sections of the adjacent margin of the fin, and in fact a naked eye
examination, shows this margin to be occupied by a special development of the
epidermis, which appears as a narrow, glistening, white band. The sections show
this to be produced by the splitting of the anterior margin by two deep longitudinal
grooves which contain a mass of epithelium, containing large vacuoles, and covered
by glistening patches of coagulated secretion. Each groove faces the margin of the spine, and when the fin closes down, and the
spine presses down on to the closed fin, each dentate margin fits into a recess formed
by the grooves, and a channel is produced along which the secretion from the
glandular structure of the recess would percolate along the dentate margin.
