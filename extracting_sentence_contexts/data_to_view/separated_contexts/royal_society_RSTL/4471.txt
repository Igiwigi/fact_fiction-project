The system of countersinking the rivets is only used when smooth surfaces are re-
quired ; under other circumstances their introduction would not he desirable, as they
do not add to the strength of the joint, but to a certain extent reduce it. This re-
duction is not observable in the experiments, but the simple fact of sinking the head
of the rivet into the plate and cutting out a greater portion of metal, must of necessity
lessen its strength, and render it weaker than the plain joint with raised heads. This
must appear evident from the fact of the sectional area of the plate being diminished,
and the consequent reduction of the heads of the rivets, which in this state are less
able to sustain the effects of an oblique or transverse strain. It is, however, satisfactory to observye that countersinking the heads of the rivets
does not seriously injure the joint in its powers of resistance to a direct tensile force ;
but the rivets are liable to start when exposed to collisions or a strong impinging
force, such as the sides of ships are frequently doomed to encounter. On referring to experiments (Table XI.), the same results as to strength are ob-
tained with the countersunk rivets as those with rounded heads; they are rather
under the mean of the former experiments, but not more than is easily accounted for
by the reduced section of the countersunk plates,

The joint with plates, riveted on each side, is seldom used, a circumstance which
probably arises from its greater complexity of form and the danger which a treble
thickness of plate would be subject to if used in boilers or vessels exposed to the ac-
tion of intense heat.
