ons [27-29]. Pow & Morris [29] revealed the classical LDCV
morphology in the dendrites and soma of MCNs and
omega-shaped fusion profiles at the plasma membrane. The
authors also visualized dendritic exocytosis from oxytocin
and vasopressin neurons when they treated hypothalamic
tissue with tannic acid to ‘freeze’ aggregations of the exocytosed
peptide granules [29-31]. Later microsampling techniques
in vivo confirmed and amplified the data on dendritic vaso-
pressin and oxytocin release and revealed many aspects of its
control [32].

The LDCVs often contain more than one neuropeptide,
and in fact many neurons release a mixture of neuropeptides
[33,34]. For instance, vasopressin coexists with dynorphin
[35], galanin [36], pituitary adenylate cyclase activating poly-
peptide (PACAP) [37] and secretin in MCNs of the SON and
PVN. On the other hand, oxytocin in the SON coexists with
encephalin and dynorphin [38,39]. Other peptides, for
example apelin, are also synthesized in MCNs, but apelin is
packed and released from separate LDCVs [40].
