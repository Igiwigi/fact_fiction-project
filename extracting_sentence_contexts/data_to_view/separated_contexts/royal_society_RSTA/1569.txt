The effective time-varying potential of the system (4.8) can be written as

Vet (X, t) = Vem — AX cos(@t + y) — H2X cos (2it + 6), (4.9)

Possible values of the effective potential Ve¢(X, t) during motion of the system, assuming 2; ~ 2,
are governed by the following relation

Vsm — (A + H2)X < Vege(X, t) < Vom + (A + Hz)X (4.11)

Consequently, following the procedure presented in the paper [9] and replacing A > A + Ho, for
the values of the amplitudes H and H2 under which resonance occurs in the system, we get the
following relation

As is seen, the effect of the low-frequency component of the noise, governed by Hp sin(2;t + 4),
is similar to the effect of the high-frequency component, H; cos ot, i.e. increasing the values of H;
and H) leads to reducing the value of A at which resonance occurs in the system. We note that for
large values of H; and Hp the value of A governed by (4.12) becomes 0 or negative. A similar effect
was noticed in [9] and attributed to the fact that for large Hj, the effective potential of the system
becomes single-well, instead of double-well. The above analysis indicates that, in contrast to the
system considered in §3, for the conventional bi-stable system (1.3), replacing noise with high-
frequency deterministic excitation allows us to qualitatively describe the system behaviour even
for large noise intensities. This is because the effects of the low-frequency and high-frequency
components of the noise appear to be similar.
