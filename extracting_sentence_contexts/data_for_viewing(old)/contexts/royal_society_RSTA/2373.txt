strict definition in structural dynamics as the mass distribution (nominally expressed by mass
matrix M) weighted by the square mode shape ¢: m= g! Mg.

Mode shapes have no units and since mode shape scaling is in principle arbitrary, modal mass
can take any value. However, it is conventional in earthquake engineering and for some finite-
element (FE) solvers to set mode shape scales such that the calculated value of mm is one mass unit
(e.g. 1kg). A more physically meaningful mode shape scaling sets the value of the largest ordinate
or the ordinate at a particular location on a structure where loading is likely to be applied to unity.
This means that modal or generalized response parameters have direct physical interpretation,
such as modal force and acceleration being actual values if a wave load is applied at the top of
a lighthouse or for shaker testing. Specifically, figure 7 sets ¢ =1 at the Service room (top of the
masonry tower), while figure 9 sets ¢ = 1 at the helipad. The former is more appropriate for wave
loading if the breaking wave impact is at Service room level, whereas in fact the effective point
of application is much further down the tower. The lower modal mass of modes 4 and 5 means
they will respond most strongly to wave impacts, and some sense of response to known load
(or some sense of load for known response) can be obtained by scaling mode shape to unity at
the wave impact point. Since the modal mass goes with square modal ordinate which decreases
rapidly with height, the effective modal mass for breaking wave impacts will be very much higher
than 314t.

A remote logging system was installed at Wolf Rock on 7 September 2017 to acquire acceleration
data from a single JA-70SA triaxial servo accelerometer installed in the Battery room (L7). While
the logger still operates, a notable sequence of storms occurred during the period 9 July 2017 to
