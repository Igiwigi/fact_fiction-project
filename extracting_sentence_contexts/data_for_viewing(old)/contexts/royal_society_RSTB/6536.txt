EMBRYOLOGY OF MIGRATORY LOCUST 187

some Hymenoptera (Netson, 1915), Heteroptera (Hrymons, 1899), and others.
Among the Apterygota it is unpaired, viz., in Lepisma (Heymons, 1897, a), Tomocerus
(Horrmann, 1911), and others. Its unpaired mode of origin among the Apterygota
and some of the primitive Pterygota would suggest this to be the primary condition.
However, the fact that the paired origin of the labrum is more widely distributed
among insects, including the primitive Pterygota, suggests the contrary. On the
whole, this difference in the origin of the labrum cannot be shown to have any
phylogenetic significance.

The determination of the morphological significance of the labrum is not easy.
The fact of its wide distribution (insects, Myriapoda and Crustacea) would seem
to leave no doubt that morphologically the labrum is not an unimportant structure.
It is also practically certain that the labrum of insects is homologous with that of
Scolopendra and very probably also with the labrum of the Trilobites and the
Crustacea. Whether the labrum is appendicular or not has beer much discussed.
The following points support its appendicular nature: (1) Its paired origin in
several insects. (2) Occurrence of an independent fair of coelomic cavities (in
Carausius morosus and Locusta migratoria) lying in the labrum. (3) The hollow nature
of the labrum, exactly like the other body appendages. The objections to the
above view are: (1) The labrum, in contrast to the other body appendages, arises
medially to the neural swellings. (2) Its unpaired origin in the Apterygota and some
of the Pterygota. On these grounds, Heymons (1895, a), Hoitmcren (1904), and
Hirscuier (1909, a, 1924) regarded the labrum merely as an unpaired evagination
