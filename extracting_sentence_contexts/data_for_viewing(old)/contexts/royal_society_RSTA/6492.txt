2. Atlantic overturning

The AMOC, which can be characterized as the northward flow of warmer saltier water in the
upper Atlantic and the southward flow of the colder fresher North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW)
in the deep Atlantic, transports a substantial amount of heat northward across the equator in
the Atlantic. In this respect, it differs radically from the Indian and Pacific Oceans, where the
heat transport is away from the equator and towards poles [13,14]. It has long been known from
Stommel’s [15] classic paper that the THC, and so the AMOC too, are potentially unstable and
could ‘flip’ modes between ‘on’ and ‘off’. Whether this is in fact possible for the real-world
circulation is unclear (see [16], for a recent review of the stability of the AMOC), but if it were
to happen the climate impacts would be substantial.

The climatic impacts of changes in the AMOC are many, either directly or via its link to
the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV; [17,18]). The significant impacts include: changes
in sea level; the ability of the North Atlantic to act as a carbon sink; Intertropical Convergence
Zone shifts; Sahel and Indian monsoons; frequency and strength of Atlantic hurricanes; El Nifio-
Southern Oscillation; Pacific Decadal Variability; North Atlantic Oscillation and storm tracks;
climate over Europe, North America and Asia; Arctic sea ice and surface air temperature; and
global surface temperature changes. In addition, paleoclimatic evidence indicates that a link
