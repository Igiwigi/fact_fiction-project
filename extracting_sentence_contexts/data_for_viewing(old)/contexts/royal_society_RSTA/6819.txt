BROWNIAN FLUCTUATIONS IN GALVANOMETERS 221

against a Weston laboratory voltmeter; the resistances in the attenuator and in the primary
circuit were measured on a Tinsley precision bridge, and corrected for a small change in
temperature between standardizing and operating rooms.

It was important, with an attenuation of the order of 108, to check that there was no direct
leakage from initial to final stages. Such a leakage did occur with the first attenuator con-
structed, and was discovered by the fact that the deflexions of the amplifier were not exactly
proportional to the attenuation when the latter was varied in the ratios 1:2:3 by altering
one resistance in the attenuator chain, although deflexions did vary correctly when one, two,
and three cells respectively were connected in at the beginning of the chain. The leakage
was eliminated by consistently earthing one side of each attenuator step, and also the metal
box in which the attenuator was housed.

The voltage sensitivity of the system had to be determined when the recorded r.m.s. of
the thermal fluctuations was about 15mm., and the width of the recording paper only
120mm. The procedure selected for speed, convenience, and appropriate accuracy was to
attenuate the calibrating voltage to give a deflexion of about 800mm. at the recording
distance of about 1500mm., and to determine this deflexion visually through the super-
imposed thermal fluctuations. The steps were as follows. A Im. scale was set up as near to
