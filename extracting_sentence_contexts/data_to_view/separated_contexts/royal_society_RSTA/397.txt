A It takes a certain type of scientist to have the
372: 20130341. forethought and motivation to initiate a series of repeat
http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2013.0341 measurements that may not show significant change

throughout their lifetime. However, it is such records that
we must turn to if we are to make informed decisions
regarding long-acting issues such as the impact of
climate change on human habitation, food supplies and
ecosystem health. The UK has a strong history of such
sustained observations and part of the motivation for this
publication is to celebrate this fact. However, much more
important is to gauge the continuing interest from the
Subject Areas: marine science community in instigating, maintaining
and funding such measurements that inherently demand
long-term financial and scientific commitment. On 17 September 2013, a one-day meeting, organized
by the Challenger Society for Marine Science and the UK
Scientific Committee for Oceanic Research, was held at
long-term observations, ocean, monitoring, the Royal Society, London, to give the UK marine science
time series community an opportunity to discuss sustained marine
observations in an open forum.
