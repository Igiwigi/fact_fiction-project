The thermometer thus constructed, will give both the tem-
perature of the air and that of the dew point ; which last is
effected by placing the mouth of the bottle containing the
ether, in contact with the upper part of the covered surface
of the bulb, when by gently inclining the bottle, the ether
will low downwards without wetting the top of the bulb,
which will almost immediately become dull by the deposition
of moisture on its 'surface ; when [the observed temperature
may be taken andthe difference ascertained. Should it be objected-against the principle/of the instru-
ment here proposed, that the indications do not exhibit the
true temperature of' the upper surface of the bulb on which
the deposition of-dew takes place, but that of the lower part
to which the ether-is applied ; it may be' answered, that by
inclining the whole instrument so as to render the axis of the
bulb horizontal, and establish thereby a free circulation of
the mercury/in every part, this objection may be obviated ;
but on repeated 'trials I have not found this to produce any
difference in'the results. I ought also perhaps to-mention that an instrument some-
what similarire principle has been -used in Vienna, and was
mentioned by Professor BAUMGARTEN of that capital to a
friend, who communicated the fact to myself. The instrument is represented in Plate. Fig: 1.
