I left these piles under a glass bell, the air of which

contraction, was discovered by myself in 1842. I shall give here a very concise summary
of the chief characteristics of induced contraction, although already known, having recently
been led to repeat my former experiments, and to determine these characteristics with
greater precision. In order to succeed in these experiments, it is necessary to operate on frogs in a
vigorous condition, and prepared very, rapidly.
