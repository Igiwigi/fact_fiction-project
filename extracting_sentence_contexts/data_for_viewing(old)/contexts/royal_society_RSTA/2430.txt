The simple form of equations (4.2) allows us to gain physical intuition about the process they in
describe. In each equation, the first term represents the deterministic, or mean rate of movement : =
for the variable x, which in fact corresponds to the derivative of the mean of the DLE (3.3). The : 3

role of this first term, taken as a force resulting from a potential proportional to x, is to drive
the solution away from the initial preparation of the system, i.e. with x localized at xo, towards
x=0. To understand how the dynamics are affected by this first term it suffices to consider the
evolution of P;, or P3, in the absence of diffusion, i.e. o = 0, and zero history ¥(t) = 0. Eliminating
these terms from the P; equation results in the FP solution P; (x,t) = 6(x — xgA(t)), which implies
that the system is localized at x = xA(t) for all times t > 0. The sign of xp determines the direction
of the resulting linear force acting on the particle. While (t) =0 for time t <r, A(t) <0 for >t.
As a result, in the monotonic regime, for xp > 0 the drift is to the left, while for x9 < 0 it will be to
the right. At long times t — 00, as A(t) > 0, this drift term pushes the solution towards x = 0. If A(t)
changes sign, the mean of the PDF goes past x = 0, but eventually changes direction back towards
x =0 once A(t) also changes sign. These oscillations continue until the steady state is reached. The
