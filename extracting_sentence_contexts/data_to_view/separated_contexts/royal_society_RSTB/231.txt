The primary representation of thi
most important synergic action is given in Plate 40, fig. 5. It will be seen that i
representation has a very wide distribution, which for the most part corresponds in
mere extent with the representation of the movements of the head alone. Asa primary
movement, its importance entitles it to first consideration, for a review of the facts
given in Table L* will exhibit the very remarkable result that, of the 104 occasions
on which this movement was observed to occur, in 100 instances it was primary. This â€”
is, no doubt, a demonstration of the necessity that this primitive movement should
precede all others. Taking first, then, the simultaneous movements of turning the head and eyes to
the opposite side, the following march can be made out for a considerable number of
centres.
