when its temperature was 50*; and from 367 to 498 minutes, when it was cooled
down to the freezing-point. The prolongation of life at the lower temperatures was
not due to torpidity, for the animals performed the functions of voluntary motion
and enjoyed the use of their senses; but it was occasioned by the diminished activity
of all their functions, and their consequent less demand for air. On the other hand,
the elevation of temperature increases the demand for air, and occasions speedier
death when it is withheld, chiefly by producing a vast acceleration in the rate at
which all the operations, both of animal and organic life, take place.

6. Although the warm-blooded animals are in great degree removed, by the inde-
pendent calorifying power which they possess, from the influence of external tempe-
rature, yet it is very easily shown that their vital activity is no less under the direct
and immediate influence of heat, than is that of cold-blooded animals. In fact, it
would seem to be for the sake of keeping up their vital energy to a certain high and
uniform rate, that they are endowed with the heat-generating power; and if this
power be not exercised, and the body be cooled down, its vital activity is reduced,
and at last extinguished. From the experiments of CyossaTÂ®* it appears that Birds
and Mammals cannot (except in the case of the hybernating species) be cooled down
more than 30* below their natural standard, without the entire suspension of their
animal and organic functions. This depression of temperature consequent upon pro-
longed starvation, was found to take place as s0on as all the fat and other disposable
materials in the body had been burned off. But $0 s0on as animals thus reduced to
a moribund condition were subjected to external heat, which artificially raised the
temperature of their bodies, their sensibility and muscular power were renewed ;
they flew about the room, and took food when it was presented to them ; and their
