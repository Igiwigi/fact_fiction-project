= Tt is well known, however, that when an electric discharge is passed through
£& oxygen, a considerable quantity of ozone is produced. It is in fact by this method
E that ozone in its purest form can be obtained. It is highly probable, then, that
© after the first discharge had passed between the electrodes, in the experiments on
%B oxygen, a considerable percentage of ozone was present in the gas, and it may be that
$ the discrepancy noted above is due to this cause. The experimental value of
& 455 volts found for oxygen seems to bear out this conclusion, for, ascribing the
A value of 161 volts to the atom of oxygen, we get by addition 483 volts as the caleu-
lated value of the minimum spark potential for ozone. The difference between the
two values is but 28 volts, and assuming that the discharge occurs initially through
the dissociation of ozone rather than of oxygen, the result is not in opposition to the
additive law which has been shown to hold for the other gases. This large influence
of a small amount of a denser gas when mixed with one less dense is in accord with
the results obtained by previous experimenters, for Warpurc* and Carsrickt in
