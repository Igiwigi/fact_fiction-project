double cone.* Outside the outermost ring, and internal to the remains of the
membrana elastica externa, in the position marked g, is a growing zone, in the inner
part of which the fifth ring will be developed, while the outer part will persist as the
growing zone. The presumption is that this growing zone, now in the outer-zone
cartilage, remains morphologically within the membrana elastica externa, even after
the remnants of that membrane are no longer to be detected ; that is to say, since in
fig. 13, B, the four rings belong to the sheath-cartilage, the presumption is that all
the 23 rings shown in fig. 25, B, are of sheath-origin. If this be admitted as a valid
argument, then Squatina is one of the most chorda-centrous of the Elasmobranch
fishes.

Militating against the acceptance of this view, though perhaps not seriously, is the
fact that, in the centra of the embryo, portions of the membrana elastica externa may
occasionally be found entangled and left behind in the older, more central parts of the
outer-zone cartilage ; the growing zone, that is to say, may in some places spread to
the outer side of the membrane. :

In the adult the radiating markings that are seen in a transverse section are

* The trunk vertebre of this fish have five rings, the vertebre in the middle of the caudal fin
only three.
