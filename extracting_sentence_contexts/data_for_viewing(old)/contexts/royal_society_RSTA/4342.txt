the high temperature stability and spatial homogeneity, significantly better than those of Ge
photodiodes [32]. It is worth to remembering that small incident powers (typically smaller than
50 .W) are required in order to avoid local heating of the gaseous sample that can be a source of
systematic deviation in DBT.

The cut-off wavelength of a standard InGaAs detector is typically 1.7 4m (with a lower limit
at 0.9 zm); its response can be extended to longer wavelength (up to 2.6 jm at room temperature)
by increasing the content of indium [33]. The resulting performance is surely deteriorated, with
a dark current density two orders of magnitude larger and a significantly lower shunt resistance
(typically smaller than 1 MQ).

When it comes to the molecular targets, the mid-infrared region, usually referred to as
‘molecular fingerprint’ region, surely offers a number of interesting possibilities. In fact, many
molecules exhibit strong and narrow rotation—vibration transitions at wavelengths larger than
31m. It is not by chance that the first DBT experiment was performed on ammonia at 10.35 jum.
NHg is a pyramidal molecule (symmetry C3y) with three identical N—-H bonds, showing four
fundamental vibrations: the symmetric stretch (vj), the symmetric bend (v2), the degenerate
antisymmetric stretch (v3) and the degenerate antisymmetric bend (v4). The non-zero spin values
of N and H nuclei lead to a hyperfine structure, which must be carefully determined and properly
accounted for in the spectral analysis. The symmetric bend, in conjunction with the phenomenon
of the inversion doubling, gives rise to two Q branches centred at 950cm™~!. Because of the
complexity of the molecule, finding a well-isolated spectral line, so as to avoid any deformation
of its profile owing to line mixing (or line interference) with neighbouring lines, is not an easy
task, even though one can exploit the strong intensities of the rotational components of the
fundamental vibrational bands.
