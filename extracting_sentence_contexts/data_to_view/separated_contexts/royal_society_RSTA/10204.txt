If, for example, it is supposed that
both changes give out 8 rays in equal amounts, it can readily be calculated that the
equation of decay would be

L = “BN —Ast +k Xs _ ) omAat
| A ooh ae

Taking the values of \, and A, found by Curte, the numerical factor e~** becomes
2°15 instead of 4°3 and 1°15 instead of 3:3. The theoretical curve of decay in this
ease would be readily distinguishable from the observed curve of decay. The fact
that the equation of decay found by Curte and Dannz involves the necessity of an
initial rayless change can be simply shown as follows :—

Curve I. (fig. 11) shows the experimental curve. At the moment of removal ot
the body from the emanation (disregarding the initial rapid change), the matter must
consist of both Band C. Consider the matter which existed in the form C at the
moment of removal.
