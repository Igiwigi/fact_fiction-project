plates, bent into spheroidal strata, and the spheroid itself may
be actually constructed by means of spheroidal strata of
glass. When this is done, it will exhibit all the complicated
phenomena produced by the simultaneous actions of two
unequal axes. ;

SEcTION VII. On the laws of double refraction in cryslals with
any number of axes.

From the coincidence which I have invariably observed
between the axes of polarisation and extraordinary refraction,
in all crystals that have only one apparent axis, we may
consider it as an established fact, that the HuyGenian law
represents, within the limits of experimental errors, not only
the phenomena of calcareous, spar, but those of all other
crystals with a single axis of double refraction.

But since it is the general character of crystals to have
more than one axis of polarisation, it becomes interesting to
ascertain, if they also have two axes of extraordinary refrac-
tion ; and if. they have, to investigate, by direct experiment,
the general laws of double refraction, for crystals with any
number of axes. Such an investigation presents difficulties of
no ordinary kind. The want of a transparent mineral with
two powerful axes, which, like calcareous spar, could be
