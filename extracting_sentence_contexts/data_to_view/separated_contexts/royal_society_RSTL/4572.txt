We cannot but expect, that, although
the general character of all these substances is very nearly the same, their special pro-
perties must present considerable diversity, which may be clearly defined by, and
even anticipated from, the theoretical conception of their constitution, as deduced
from the present investigation. Though fully aware of the dangers threatening the

inquirer as 800n as he steps beyond the interpretation of well-established facts, it is
difficult to resist the temptation of indulging even now in some speculations on the
probable deportment of these alkaloids. In a former paper* I have pointed out that,
the methods which convert the ammonia-salts into nitriles, fail to produce a similar
effect upon the salts of aniline, while experiment has shown that these salts are capable
of producing compounds analogous to the amides, to the amidogen-acids and to the
imides. This result is perfectly intelligible if we conceive aniline in the light of an
amidogen-base.
