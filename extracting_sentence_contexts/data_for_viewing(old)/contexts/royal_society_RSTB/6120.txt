peculiar and characteristic are these structures that they may safely be regarded as
additional evidence of the close affinity between birds and crocodiles. (N.B.—The
structure named “ prenasal process” in the chondrocranium of Sphenodon by Howxs
and SwINNERTON (1901) is a paired element, corresponding to what we have called the
cupula anterior of the nasal capsule. Similarly, the cartilago prenasalis which BAck-
str6m has described in the grass-snake (1931) is paired.)

Turning now to the general form of the chondrocranium of the bird, as exemplified
by the duck, figs. 54, 55, Plate 49, at the stage when there is the greatest development
of the orbital cartilage, it is clear that it bears strong resemblances to the crocodile, and,
in a general way, to the other living reptiles. But here it is necessary to take into
consideration the evidence presented by the occipito-atlantic joint. In this the birds,
as might be expected, resemble the Crocodilia and the Chelonia. This latter fact may
perhaps be regarded as a support for the view that the Chelonia are derived from a
Diapsid stock, common to them and Crocodilia, and not separately from an Anapsid
stock. Sphenodon and the Squamata, on the other hand, show a different type of
joint. This latter type is adopted by the mammals, with the modification entailed by

this type, in its main lines, is found in mammals and in Sphenodon and Squamata, can
