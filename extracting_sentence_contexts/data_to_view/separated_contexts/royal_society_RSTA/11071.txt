2 One of the authors of this paper had already pointed out (‘ The Mean Density of
athe Earth, 1894, p. 7) that if the attraction between two crystal spheres were
lfforent for a given distance, according as their like axes were parallel or crossed,
Such difference should show itself by a directive action on one sphere in the field of
gthe other. This directive action is suggested by the growth of a crystal from solu-
Etion, where the successive parts are laid down in parallel arrangement—a fact which
Swhich we might perhaps interpret on the molecular hypothesis as showing that,
within molecular range at least, there is directive action. The experiment now to be described is a modification of one indicated in the work
above referred to, carried out for two quartz spheres, and we may say at once that
we have certainly not succeeded in proving the existence of a directive action of the
kind sought for. To bring out the principle of the method, let us suppose that the law of the attrac-
tion between two spheres with their like axes parallel, as in fig. 1 (a), is GMM’/,”,
where M, M’ are the masses, 7 the distance between the centres, and G a constant
for this arrangement.
