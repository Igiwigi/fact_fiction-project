Our conclusion is that these coals were formed
in situ, and that in them the “ coal ball” concretions were slowly aggregated without
any serious disturbance. Trifling drifting, due to local currents or streams is, of
course, not to be denied, but in the main the coals represent forests which grew where
their remains now lie. We here touch the larger question of coal formation, as well
as that of the coal balls themselves, because the facts quoted seem to afford practical
proof of the in situ'theory of the formation of the coal. Nevertheless, the day is past
