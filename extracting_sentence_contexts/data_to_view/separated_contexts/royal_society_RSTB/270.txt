The only new piece of evidence which my observations afford on this point is the fact . that at the time of its earliest development the water-pore has no connection with
any of the skeletal plates ; so that in this point too Antedon resembles other Echino- â€”
derms. In fact it seems probable that this and the other external openings (mouth
and anus) of the Echinoderms opened primitively in or near the median line, along
which ran the mesentery separating the right and left body-cavities ; and that at the
time the different groups of Echinoderms separated from one another the mouth
alone had departed from this position, and had taken up a definite station in the
centre of the left side. The water-pore, which may have been from the first slightly
on the left side, subsequently worked its way, in some groups (Crinoids and Ophiurids)
on to the oral, in others (Echinids and Asterids) on to the aboral, side; so |
that, although its interradius probably remains the same, its position with regard
to the calcareous plates is secondary. The anus, on the other hand, had already
commenced to shift its position along the line of the ventral mesentery, and in
some groups it continued to do so without migrating either to the dorsal or
ventral side, while in others such shifting of position was soon put a stop to by the
migration of the anus on to the aboral surface.
