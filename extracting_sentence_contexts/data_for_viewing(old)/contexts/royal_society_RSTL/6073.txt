quantity of treacle, honey, tar, or melted caoutchone, all of which have been referred
=to as illustrative of the character of ice; and let the mass move down the slope in the
irection of the arrow. Let ST be a narrow segment of the viscous substance ; this
-28egment, as it moves downwards, will take the form S"T'. Supposing Ti to be a square
Selement of the mass, it will be distorted lower down into the lozenge 'T'7, and the line
BT6 will become T'#. Now the analogy between such a substance and ice fails in this
Srespect; in the viscous mass the short diagonal of the square sfretches to the long one
2of the lozenge, but, in the glacier, the ice breaks at right angles to the tension, and
EZ marginal crevasses are formed. It was by means of the simple diagram here sketched
that Mr. Horkxixs showed why the marginal creyasses of a glacier are inclined towards
Sits source*. This fact, therefore, 80 far as it goes, is also opposed to the idea of
BZ viscosity.
£2 But it is known that in the case of a substance confessedly viscous, a sudden shock or
strain may produce fracture. Professor FokBrs justly urges, © that sealing wax at mode-
Arate atmospheric temperatures, will mould itself (with time) to the most delicate inequal-
ties of the surface on which it rests . . . . . but may, at the same time, be shivered to
atoms by a blow with a hammerÞ.” Hence, in order to estimate the weight of the
objection, that the glacier breaks when subjected to strain, we must know the conditions
under which the force is applied.
The fifteenth station on the line (EF!) at Trelaporte stands on the lateral moraine of the
I glacier; between it and the fourteenth, a distance of 300 links, or 190 feet, intervenes.
and within this distance the glacier suffers its maximum strain. Let AB (fig. 5) be the
