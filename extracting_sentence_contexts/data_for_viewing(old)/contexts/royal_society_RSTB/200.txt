Glaboration of the clubs at the same part of the tail is worthy ef special note.

S As the size of the head of the club increases the development of the stem is
gurested, and after a time the whole club, instead of being as long as the adjacent
‘Bnuscular fibres, is at least one-third shorter ; and as development proceeds, the tail

r process is reduced to a long, narrow, somewhat ribbon-shaped structure, only
Gpartially striated (figs. 3 to 9). ;

Tt may hence be taken for granted that the expansion of the anterior end of the
original muscular fibre has resulted from a change in the motor plate, accompanied by
corresponding changes in the motor nerves and the cells in the spinal cord from which
they originate, his seems to be corroborated by the fact that in slightly older
embryos the nerve cells around the embryonic neural tube are relatively large and
distinct. ”

_ As the motor plate, with the help of the rapidly multiplying muscle nuclei (which

continue to arrive for some time from the head of the club), increases in size the nerves

in connection with the plate develop new branches, which occupy a nearly vertical

position in front of the plate. These branches, after reaching a certain size, are
