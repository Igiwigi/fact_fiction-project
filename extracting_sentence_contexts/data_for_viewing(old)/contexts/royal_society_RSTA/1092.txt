4. Relevance to acoustic radiation of coherent structures in turbulent shear
flows: an outlook

The theoretical efforts have thus far focused on instability modes on laminar flows in order to
provide definitive and self-consistent descriptions. The mathematical procedures and even results
are, however, applicable to coherent structures in the corresponding turbulent shear flows insofar
as the latter can be treated as a wavepacket of instability modes with an amplitude function A.
However, two important facts must be noted about turbulent flows. The first is that turbulent
mean flows vary more rapidly in the streamwise direction than their laminar counterparts, and
thus the resulting stronger non-parallelism must be taken into account. Secondly, the coherent
structures are influenced by fine-scale turbulence via the phase averaged small-scale Reynolds
stresses [58]. For turbulent flows with a generalized inflection point, the Reynolds stress tensor
may be represented by a local gradient type of closure model allowing for a possible phase lag
between it and the strain rate tensor of the large-scale structures [59]. With these two effects being
taken into account in the nonlinear critical-layer approach, the kernel function in the amplitude
equations must be modified [48]. Of course, the amplitude evolution of CS may well be provided
by DNS or experiments, in which case the information may be supplied to the formulae.

While the results were derived for free shear flows, the circular jet in particular, they may
be applied to instability waves/CS in laminar/turbulent wall-bounded flows. The analysis
