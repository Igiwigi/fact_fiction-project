Otherwise, measurement error can
lead to the overestimation of social mobility and lead the noise of spurious social mobility to swamp the signal of true social
mobility. This is particularly challenging because it is difficult to distinguish measurement uncertainty in rank order—arising
from sampling bias, observer error and missing data—from biological uncertainty in rank relationships among individuals
[57]. In fact, because active intragenerational mobility by definition involves changing dominance relationships, biological
uncertainty in rank orders is expected to increase during periods of active mobility. Therefore, a crucial step is to develop
methods for measuring and interpreting uncertainty in estimates of social mobility. The Glicko-rating, randomized Elo-
rating and percolation and conductance (PERC) methods incorporate approaches for quantifying uncertainty around inferred
dominance ranks or scores [45,49,58], but no study has yet used these uncertainty estimates when inferring hierarchy
dynamics.

when instead they will eventually enjoy dominant status, and more tolerant of despotism by dominants [64].
