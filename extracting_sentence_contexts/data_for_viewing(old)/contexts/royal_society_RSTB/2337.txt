It is seen that the amounts of liquid evaporated under these conditions in equal
times, are in no way proportional to the respective areas of the apertures, but
approximate to the ratios of their linear dimensions. The approximation in this
case would have been much closer had a thinner dise of metal been used as the
septum.

From the well-known fact that the laws of diffusion of substances in solution are
the same as those for the diffusion of gases and vapours, it might be reasonably
expected that the “diameter law” would also hold!good,for_solutes,

In order to demonstrate this, it is necessary in the first instance to adopt some
plan by which the mobility of the solvent may be so far reduced as to allow the
statie condition, or an approximation towards it, to be established, without inter-
fering with the natural gradient of density of the solute by currents in the liquid.
This can be accomplished by using a solution of the substance to which about 5 per
cent. of gelatine has been added.*

* Several observers have previously used gelatine or agar-agar in diffusion experiments, and have found
that the rapidity of diffusion is practically the same as with water only.
