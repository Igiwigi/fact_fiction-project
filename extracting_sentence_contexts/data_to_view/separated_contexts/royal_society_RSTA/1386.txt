Considering the posed question as to whether the accumulated internal energy of the sample
prior to fracturing is the elastic energy of the deformed sample or a kinetic energy of moving
particles, we have found that most of the energy is transferred to the sample by its quasi-static
deformation. Only in the case of very fragile materials is the mechanism of energy transfer by
excitation of particle movements efficient. It follows from the simple fact that samples built of
such materials cannot withstand any larger deformation. The internal energy of the sample built up during the loading stage was released twofold. In many cases, when particle bonds exhibited some flexibility, it converted directly to a single
dynamic fracture or a multi-fracture system.
