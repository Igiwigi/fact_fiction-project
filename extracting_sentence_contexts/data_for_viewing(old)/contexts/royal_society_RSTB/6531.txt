tive test for urease. No urea can be detected in the nephridial fluid, but it is possible
that it is actually formed and escapes detection (the earthworm was thought to
excrete ammonia only until DeLaunay (1931) with improved technique showed
it to excrete urea as well).* Thus the nephridia may have the power of converting
neutral urea into alkaline ammonia, and they may be important in the excretion
of soluble metabolites, such as phosphate and sulphate ions, these ions being partly
neutralized by nephridial ammonia.

Blood Circulation
Indirect evidence on the course of blood circulation indicates that it reaches the
pericardium partly by the ostia in the pericardial floor and partly by the intra-
muscular canal system (see p. 451). The former is a most unusual route, and the
* This suggestion is supported by the fact that a brei of that part of the body wall containing the
nephridia repeatedly has been found to contain urease. Too much importance, however, must not
be attached to this since the dorsal body wall also gives a positive reaction but to a less marked extent.

latter takes the place of the common arthropod channel passing from the outer
side of the limb base, up the side of the body external to the pericardial floor. The
pericardial floor in Peripatopsis is fused to the lateral musculature high up, as occurs
in other arthropods intersegmentally, and segmentally where limbs are wanting or
