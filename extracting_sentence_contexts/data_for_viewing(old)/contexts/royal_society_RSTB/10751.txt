Having this methodological restriction in mind, psycho-
pathological conditions, generally speaking, define mental
disorders as norm-deviant disturbances of subjective experi-
ences. Norm-deviances can occur in any of the following
domains: (i) changes in interactive and communicative be-
haviour, (ii) inadequate emotional experiences or changes in
sharing emotional experiences with others, (iii) inconsistency
of subjective experiences or incongruency with experiences of
others leading to a loss of a sense of reality that can be shared
by the majority of other persons within the same cultural
background. In other words, one of the constitutive aspects
of mental disorders is the fact that they are defined on the
basis of norms that are generated or constituted by groups
of persons, populations or social systems [86]. How we
approach others—and how we are in turn perceived by
them—crucially depends on the situational context which
provides a set of gestures, symbols and meanings that need
to be shared in the given situation in order to establish a
common ground between both partners [87]. As a conse-
quence, communication can only be studied in context, this

is especially true under the conditions of psychopathological
norm deviations. Psychopathological phenomena are substan-
tially determined by cultural influences [27, p. 73 and p. 92].
