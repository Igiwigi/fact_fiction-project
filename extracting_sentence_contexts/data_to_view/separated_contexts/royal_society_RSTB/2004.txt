In all these experiments the nitragin was applied directly to the seeds before
sowing. Series vi. of this set of experiments gave a lower percentage of positive results
than was expected from former trials, This, I believe, may be mainly attributed to
the fact that the plants were too much forced during the early stages of their growth,
owing to the somewhat high temperatures reached during that time. As a result the
plants wilted suddenly when about a fortnight old, and did not recover themselves
again at all satisfactorily. I should mention, too, that with two exceptions, there
were no tubercles yet formed on the roots.
