and therefore the characteristic function w and the time f, in parabolic as well as in
elliptic motion, are functions of the chord and of the sum of the radii. By thus
making a infinite in the foregoing expressions, we find, for parabolic motion, the par-
tial differential equations

of the expression (S.), for the time, is

which latter is a known expression.

The formulz (K5.) and (LT3.), to the comparison of which we have reduced the
Study of elliptic motion, extend to hyperbolic motion also ; and in any binary system,
with Newrox's law of attraction, the simplified characteristic function w may be
