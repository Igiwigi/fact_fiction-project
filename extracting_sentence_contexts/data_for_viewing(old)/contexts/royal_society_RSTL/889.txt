difficulties; for this reason, the conclusions have been founded
only upon such facts as were uniformly the same under every
circumstance. These general conclusions have been already
fully stated ; but we may again observe, that gold of moderate
ductility is (all things being considered) the best adapted to the
purpose of coin, and that the real wear of such coin is, in all
probability, very slowly effected; s0 that a long period of time
must elapse, before any considerable diminution in weight can
be perceived.

The experiments contained in these three sections were limited
to standard gold; and, allowing that some curious and instruc-
tive facts have been discovered, still more might have been
expected from an extension of such experiments to gold variously
alloyed in every possible proportion: But an immense addition
to metallurgical science would, in all probability, be derived from
a comparative investigation of the whole of the known metallic
substances, formed into binary, ternary, and such like combi-
nations, proceeding from the most simple to the most compli-
cated, and accompanied by accurate observations on the lustre,
colour, ductility, hardness, specific gravity, and fusibility of the
compounds.

Our actual knowledge of the properties of metallic mixtures
is certainly very imperfect, and has by no means kept pace with
