will be that for rays passing through in a plane distant # from the central section

%—%m+o(4—h) = A+Ba

instead of being exactly constant, B being a small coefficient.

This will broaden the band and render it more diffuse, but will not shift its centre.
Observation shows that this effect must be very small, as, in general, the band is very
well defined.

$12. Error due to Weight of Beams themselves.

In computing the stresses no heed has, so far, been paid to the fact that the
weights of the glasses themselves will introduce certain stresses in the slabs. The
weight of each slab is on the average 120 grammes. This, although very small
compared with the total load in most cases, may introduce a small error in the case
of the band of the first order, which corresponds to a smaller load.

For the beam N the weight of the glass was found to introduce practically no
bending moment in the centre, as the supports were very nearly at the quarter and
three-quarter span points.

For the beam F the moment introduced is the same as if the weight on this slab
were increased by exactly its own weight.
