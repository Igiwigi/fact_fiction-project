the left-hand side being obtained as the electromotive force necessary to balance t
resistance, and the right-hand side as the electromotive force of induction due to
decay of the currents. Ifz be the modulus of decay of the type in question,

Now let ¢ represent a fictitious distribution of current over the ellipsoid, which shall
have the same magnetic effect in the interior as the actual inducing field. This
distribution is found at once from (69). The equation of induced currents will then be

or

When the free currents have died away all our functions will vary as e”, where p
measures the rapidity of the changes in the field. Substituting in (90), we find
