oriented at right angles to those of the needles. Though the order of magnitude of this
pattern of ‘ridges’ and ‘rungs’ was perhaps a hundred times larger than the scale pattern,
its impressive regularity and similarity to the latter prompted the question whether the
factors at work in producing the ridge pattern might not be similar to those concerned in the
production of the needles and ‘rungs’ in the film of potassium mercuric iodide.

The regularity of the crystal pattern arises from competition between adjacent nuclei of
crystallization in a medium undisturbed by convection (the great surface/volume ratio of
the film and the microscopic dimensions of the system both contribute to this condition).
Each nucleus is removing molecules from solution so that within a certain distance of
a given nucleus it is impossible for a second nucleus to be established; if it arises it will soon
regress, because it cannot compete with the nucleus already established and rapidly
augmenting in size. The fact that each nucleus gives rise to an acicular crystal depends
on the relative rates of growth of the different crystal surfaces, which in turn depend on
the nature of the substance. The equidistant spacing and parallelism of the needles are both
due to competition.

When the system of parallel needles has been established, however, the solution continues
to lose water by evaporation, and the concentration of the mother liquor between the
needles rises until the probability of new nuclei forming is once more significant. A new set
of acicular crystals forms, regularly spaced, though at a different spacing because of changed
conditions, and at right angles to the original needles. Their regular spacing is again due
to competition with each other; their orientation at right angles to the original needles, to
competition with these.
