The QBist DM-scheme is based on generalization of classical FTP based
on PU of information given by an information complete measurement. This formula differs from the
aforementioned additive generalization of FTP representing quantum interference and is used in
the Vaxjé interpretation of the quantum formalism as a PU scheme. We remark that, in fact, generalized ‘Vaxj6-FTP’ must not be rigidly coupled to the statistical
interpretation of the quantum state and QP. Following QBists, one can also use the subjective
interpretation. Then, our final proposal is to proceed with the QBist subjective probability and private
experience ideology, but endowed with another PU rule—the one based on the Vaxjé version

3It is always better to cite explicitly the creators of theory.

4Of course, QBism is a grandson of Copenhagenists and the Copenhagen interpretation played the fundamental role in
establishing QBism.
