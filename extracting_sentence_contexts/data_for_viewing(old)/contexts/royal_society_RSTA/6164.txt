its duration can be extended in multi-scalar models that exhibit recurrent acceleration because the
mechanism underlying this phenomenon is one that slows the fall of â‚¬ from its maximum value.
It remains to be seen whether this slowing is sufficient.

Whatever the resolution of tension between string theory and the observed accelerated
expansion of our Universe, one lesson to be learned is surely that it would be naive to suppose of
any cosmological compactification of string theory that the compact space is time-independent.
However, its time-dependence could easily lead to an unacceptably large time-dependence of
parameters of the effective four-dimensional theory and a possible decompactification. One


feature of accelerated expansion is that it can freeze the time evolution of the compact space;
in the analysis leading to the lower bound on w mentioned above, this was due to the fact that an
accelerating expansion of the four-dimensional universe required a decelerating expansion of the
compact space.

Dark energy may be simple but it is not so simply accommodated by string/M-theory, which
in most other respects is still our best collection of ideas for a unified theory of particle physics
with quantum gravity. It may be time to look for new ideas!
