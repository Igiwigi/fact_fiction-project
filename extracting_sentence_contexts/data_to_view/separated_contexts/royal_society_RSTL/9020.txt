Hence the period represents the time during which a certain summation of
stimulating influence is taking place in the ganglia. The period of latent stimulation in the case of Aurelic is greatly modified by certain
conditions. Of these, temperature exerts the greatest influence ; but, as a noyel fact of
great interest, the most important influence from a physiological point of view is that of
the summation of stimuli, which, however, I need not again describe. At the bottom of

a staircase the latent period is & second, while at the top of a staircase if is only & second. Summation of stimuli also greatly increases the amplitude of the contractions; s0 that it
both deyelops in the tissue a state of expectancy and arouses it into a state of increased
activity, My results in this connexion differ from those of Dr.
