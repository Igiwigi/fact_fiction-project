abdomen, and probably in the thorax also, axons that are never more than 4y in diameter,
and usually much smaller, pass through the sheaths of the median fibres and appear to
fuse with their axons (figure 2, plate 22; figures 24, 25, plate 23). In many cases it is clear
that these processes are in true fusion with the median axon, and they can be traced back
laterally and ventrally in the ganglion towards the nerve cell bodies in it.

The lateral giant fibres which arise in each ganglion do not arise from a single axon of
the dimensions of the main lateral fibre, and it seems that they also are formed by the
fusion of several very small axons.

A histological proof that the median and lateral giant fibres are syncitial structures thus
cannot be given, but the fact that the axons can never be traced back to single cell bodies
in spite of their large size, and the fact that they enter into relations of apparent fusion
with axons in each ganglion, seems ample proof that they are fused neurons and, unlike
the motor fibres, connected with more than one cell body (figure 44).

The septa in the median giant fibres

In the thoracic ganglia of the ventral nerve cord the axoplasm of each median giant
fibre is frequently interrupted by septa which pass through the axoplasm. These septa
never, however, divide the axoplasm completely, for although they may appear to do so
in one section when they pass from one side of the fibre to the other, it is found on following
the series that they are at some point incomplete (figures 30, 31, plate 24; figure 4, plate 22),
so that the axoplasm of the median fibre in fact passes without interruption from one end
of the cord to the other. The septa are of variable appearance though they always seem
