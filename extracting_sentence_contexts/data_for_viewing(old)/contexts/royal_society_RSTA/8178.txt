in terms of the same monochromatic radiation as used in (a) ;

(e) Direct optical comparison of the end-gauge mentioned in (d) with a composite
gauge of special construction, in terms of the same monochromatic radiation ;

(f) Comparison of the composite gauge, in a line-standard comparator, with a reference
line-standard which has been compared with the Prototype ;

(g) Comparison of the reference standard with the Prototype in a line-standard
comparator.

With regard to the last two operations, the introduction of the reference line-
standard, or Prototype copy, is rendered necessary by the fact that the use of the

Prototypes is legally restricted to comparisons with their copies at certain prescribed
times, and that it is the copies which serve as the bases of comparison during inter-
mediate periods,

For the provisional measurements of the Metre, the results of which are quoted

later in this paper, two further stages were involved between (f) and (g). The inter-
mediate line-standard employed for comparison with the composite end-bar was the
