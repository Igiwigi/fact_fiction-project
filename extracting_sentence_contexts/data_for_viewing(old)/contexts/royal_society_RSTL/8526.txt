If we write z+4p for x, and suppose the terms arranged in pairs from the begin-
ning, we find

{tanh (z+46)+tanh (z—Jv)}+{tanh (v+3þ)+tanh (@—3þ)}+&e.

as the unity which is introduced on the ler 6 side by the change is cancelled by
the unity on the left-hand side, which results from the supposition that the number of
terms is even.
