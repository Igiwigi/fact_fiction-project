‘At the end of Stage IV., at which stage, as will be seen later, the superficial
Glaries of the mucosa break down and the blood contained therein is scattered
mg the meshes of the stroma, this flushing becomes exaggerated into congestion ;
at Stage V. dark red spots are to be seen scattered about all over the surface of
mucosa: they are contained within the epithelium, and are caused by the
gemation of lacune.
It is to be noted that when only few specks of blood are seen they are confined to
rn wall of the uterus, or are more numerous there, and it is only when they
plentiful that they occupy both walls in equal proportions. This circumstance
ndicates that the increased supply of blood, which is a marked feature during
menstruation, affects the dorsal before it affects the ventral walls, a supposition
which is confirmed by histological examination.
The fact that during pregnancy the dorsal disc of the bilobed placenta is developed
faster than the ventral disc is in harmony with this statement. :
In the cavity of the uterus there is no discharge from the glands during Stage IIL. ;

during Stages IV. and V., however, a colourless viscid material is sometime
therein ; the labia, also, have a viscid discharge adhering to them, and I am j
to think much of this is derived from the glands of the cervix.
