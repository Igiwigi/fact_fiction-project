by the manometer, the ligature was made fast and the only precaution nece
to take the pressure from the main vein as above shown from time to time.
The indirect method was by means of a piece of intestinal tube, which, aftey

paration by drying, removal of fat and soaking in glycerine and water, was til»
each end on the two arms of a T-piece. This formed a ring which could be mee t
press with varying degree of force upon the limb, by filling it more or less with wr»
some other fluid. The upright of the T-piece was connected with a manomete
was found however after repeated trial that the difficulties in the employme it
method were very great. In the first place the pressure inside the gut require
high, and very frequently caused rupture, and in the second place—ap
leakage—the pressure in the veins registered by the manometer diminished. |
rently this was due to the fact that the ligature expelled the blood and lymp
the superficial parts of the limb, which therefore yielded and consequently d "
the pressure on the limb. This method was given up therefore and an elastic li
with direct measurement of the venous blood-pressure was adoped as the us nthe
of procedure. The actual blood-pressure was only measured in a certain
cases in which it was necessary. In the greater number of the exp i
ligature was regulated to such a degree of tightness as would correspond to
or 30 millims. of venous pressure. In these cases it was more important
arterial flow should not be stopped than that the venous obstruction sho
great, and therefore the pulse, as above stated, was taken as a guide.
pressure, however, was always applied to make saphenous vein tense. 4
