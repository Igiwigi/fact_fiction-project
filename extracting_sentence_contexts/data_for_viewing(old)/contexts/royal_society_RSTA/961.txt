account that for a point (F, H) from the swallow-tail zone, we have two disjoint Liouville tori. The
corresponding cycles will be denoted by x and j., where jz, is used for the vanishing cycle on
the family of ‘narrow’ tori, and the other, i.e. 4, corresponds to a ‘wide’ torus.

Note that the first cycle y is uniquely defined by the S!-action. The cycle 1, is also well defined
by the topology of the fibration (as a vanishing cycle). The other cycle uz is not. It is easy to see that
pis defined up to the transformation of the form w+> w+ ky,k € Z. This is caused by ambiguity
in the choice of the cross-section V which can be chosen in many homotopically different ways
(this phenomenon is discussed and explained in detail in [7]).

Summarizing, on each stratum of the bifurcation complex, we have a pair of action variables
Iy,I, and Iy,,I,,, (the latter for the swallow-tail stratum). Each of these functions can be treated as
a real-analytic function of H and F. In fact, we have already considered the actions I, and I,,, in
the previous §5, where they were denoted by I(H, F) and I,(H, F). We keep this notation here, i.e.
we set I, =I, I,,, =1,. The remaining action is denoted by I, so that we have three action variables
II, and I,,. The first two of them are well defined, but I,, is defined modulo transformation I, >
I, + KI.

Also note that I(H, F) is real-analytic everywhere (strictly speaking we need to distinguish this
action for the families of ‘narrow’ and ‘wide’ tori, but, due to real-analyticity, 1(H, F), as a function
of H and F, is the same for both families). The function I,,(H,F) is defined and is real-analytic


everywhere except for the hyperbolic branch Upyp of the bifurcation diagram. When approaching
Zhyp, the function tends to certain finite limits, but these limits from above and from below are
