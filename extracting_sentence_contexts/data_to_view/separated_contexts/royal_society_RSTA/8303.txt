The
atomic numbers of Na, Mg, Al and Si are respectively 11, 12, 13, 14, and the neutral
atoms give spectra consisting alternately of doublets and triplets.* The spectrum of
neutral silicon (Si I) includes triplets and, as shown in the table, the spectrum of ionised
silicon (Si II) may be expected to be similar to that of neutral aluminium (Al I) and to
yield a system of doublets. In the same way, the spectra of Si III and Si IV were
expected to resemble in type the spectra of Mg I and Na I respectively. All spectra in
the same vertical column of the foregoing table should, in fact, be of the same type. Corresponding lines in the spectra, however, would be expected to be displaced to shorter
wave-lengths as the degree of ionisation is increased, in consequence of the increased
nuclear charge. These predictions have also been realised, as will presently appear.
