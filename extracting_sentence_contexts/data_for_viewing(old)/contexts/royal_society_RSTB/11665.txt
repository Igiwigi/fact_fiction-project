responses to easily identifiable pairs of items, as illustrated in
figure 1. The correct response on each trial is determined by the
rules determined by the current pair of items and the context of
spatial location. On each trial, human participants are presented
with two different item stimuli in the same spatial context
(screen location) separated by a short memory delay. Participants
make a keyboard response based on whether the presented
items are paired in a ‘Go’ or ‘NoGo’ configuration. The stimulus
pairings for correct ‘Go’ responses are summarized in figure 1,
where the first stimuli are indicated by A,B,C,D and the second
stimulus by X or Y. Feedback indicates whether the response is cor-
rect or incorrect for each response. Importantly, participants are
naive to the fact that pairings are made based on spatial location.
