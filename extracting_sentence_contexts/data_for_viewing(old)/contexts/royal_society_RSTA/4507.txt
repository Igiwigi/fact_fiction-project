one needs in order to work with reliable statistics [32].

Regarding the selection of the parameters, Bandt and Pompe suggested working with 4 <
D <6 and specifically considered an embedding delay t =1 in their cornerstone paper [31].
Nevertheless, it is clear that other values of t could provide additional information. It has been
recently shown that this parameter is strongly related, if it is relevant, to the intrinsic TS of the
system under analysis [37-39].

Additional advantages of the method reside in (i) its simplicity (we need few parameters:
the pattern length/embedding dimension D and the embedding delay r) and (ii) the extremely
fast nature of the pertinent calculation process [40]. The Bandt and Pompe methodology can be
applied not only to TS representative of low dimensional dynamical systems, but also to any
type of TS (regular, chaotic, noisy or reality based). In fact, the existence of an attractor in the
D-dimensional phase space is not assumed. The only condition for the applicability of the Bandt
and Pompe method is a very weak stationary assumption: for k < D, the probability for x¢ < x;4
should not depend on t. For a review of Bandt and Pompe’s methodology and its applications
to physics, biomedical and econophysics signals, see Zanin et al. [41]. Rosso et al. [32] show that
the above-mentioned quantifiers produce better descriptions of the process associated dynamics
when the PDF is computed using the Bandt and Pompe rather than using the usual histogram
methodology.

The Bandt and Pompe proposal for associating probability distributions to TS (of an
underlying symbolic nature) constitutes a significant advance in the study of nonlinear dynamical
systems [31]. The method provides univocal prescription for ordinary, global entropic quantifiers
of the Shannon kind. However, as was shown by Rosso and co-workers [22,23], ambiguities arise
