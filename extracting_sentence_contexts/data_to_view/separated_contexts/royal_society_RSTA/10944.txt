The first theorem may be very simply proved.

ยง 10. Suppose we are given, for example, that equality of contraries subsists for

frequencies of the fifth order; then we have
(ABCDE) = (aBy8e)
(ABCDe) = (aBySE)

(ABCD) = (aBy8)

and so on. The expansions of contrary frequencies are in fact necessarily contrary

or adding

themselves.

ยง 11. Next for Theorem II. To take the simplest case, let us suppose equality of
contraries given for the second order frequencies.
