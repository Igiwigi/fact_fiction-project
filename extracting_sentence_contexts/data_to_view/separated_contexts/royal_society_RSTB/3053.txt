The epidermal cells only became very slightly enlarged, and were not
broken through by the underlying tissues. Probably this fact is to be explained by
the small size of the outgrowths formed, as SoravER* notes that, in the cases
he noticed, the epidermis was ruptured. Again, the small size of the intumescences
appears to be due to the fact that they were developed slowly, on leaves which were
not growing actively. No oil, starch, nor any abnormal substance was observed in the
cells. Later their walls became brownish.
