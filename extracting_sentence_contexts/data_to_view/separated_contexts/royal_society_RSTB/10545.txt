Cryo-electron tomography: an ideal tool to
study membrane-associated complexes

For many years, the structure of membrane-associated pro-
teins has been extremely difficult to resolve and study. About a quarter of all proteins are associated to a membrane
but only 656 unique protein structures have been determined
(reported in November 2016 on MemProtMD (http: //blanco.
biomol.uci.edu/mpstruc/)). In fact, the presence of exposed
hydrophobic transmembrane regions makes the crystalliza-
tion process difficult, and often the transmembrane domain
is cleaved to increase chances of success [22]. Alternatively,
the preparation of two-dimensional crystals, and_ their

analysis through electron diffraction, allows resolution of
the structure of membrane-associated proteins in a confor-
mation that is the closest to the one displayed in the lipid
bilayer [23,24]. Two-dimensional crystallization relies on the
use of detergents that maintain the hydrophobic regions
properly folded while also using conditions for crystallization
that can be extremely difficult.
