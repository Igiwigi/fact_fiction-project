In many cases the recognition of these relations furnished im-
portant arguments in discussions regarding the true molecular value of organic com-
pounds. Chemists have observed a vast number of new illustrations, and for several
series, in which the individual terms differ from each other by a constant elementary
difference, the corresponding difference of boiling-point has been carefully determined. Nevertheless, these relations, the important means of control which they afford in expe-
rimental inquiries, and the assistance which they are frequently capable of lending in
the determination of the true chemical character of a new compound, have scarcely been
sufficiently appreciated. :

The rapid progress of organic chemistry has greatly expanded the material ayailable
for the discussion of boiling-points, and up to the latest date the stream of experimental
inquiry, whilst confirming or correcting former observations, has furnished a rich supply
of additional important facts. The time has arrived when a survey of the territory safely
acquired may be taken, and when from the boundary lines reached we may fix the
directions in which we have next to advance. A collection of my researches on this subject in a connected form, permitting this
survey, and showing the results which may be expected from their application, I now
beg leave to submit to the Royal Society, hoping that their attention may not be with-
