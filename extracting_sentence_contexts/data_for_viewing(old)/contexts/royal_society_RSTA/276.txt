In 1995, The Lancet published a paper, led by Andrew Wakefield that claimed
a link between Crohn’s disease and the measles vaccine [7]. The study looked at

The authors opined that there was an increase in the relative risk of developing
inflammatory bowel disease after vaccination. The subsequent media attention
