with a more constant effect, targeting either full or partial mitigation of specific
adverse global warming impacts, such as Greenland ice mass loss (and sea-level
rise) or regional summer heat waves. Geoengineering and conventional greenhouse
gas mitigation are not mutually exclusive of each other [7], and in avoiding severe
global environmental impacts in the future, wedges might involve both emission
reductions and geoengineering. Planned reforestation, for example, is effectively
soth. Ideally, geoengineering wedges might be biased towards the carbon side of

1e equation [1,8]. Removing CO, also helps directly mitigate ocean acidification

1an simply the consequence of greenhouse gas emissions.

Geoengineering is no longer the realm of science fiction, with key technologies
necessary to make some of the schemes work emerging and understanding
of climate impacts improving. Geoengineering represents a new wave in a
process through which human society has been progressively changing the
albedo and hydrology of the land surface for thousands of years as agriculture
1as developed and the population urbanized, and more recently, changing the
greenhouse composition of the atmosphere and chemistry of the ocean as societies
1ave industrialized. The manipulation of global climate by alternating both
surface short-wave budgets and atmospheric long-wave radiation budgets is
1ence not an alien activity to us. Knowing full well, as we do now, of the
climate implications of vegetation cover changes and increased greenhouse gas
concentrations, we can hardly claim innocence of the climate changes wrought by
our continuing global-scale engineering. We are missing only the explicit intention
