Indeed, at voltage amplitude U = +46 kV for P=1,3 and 5atm,
R,=(14+0.2), 0.9 and 0.8mm, respectively, for positive polarity, and R- =1, 0.5 and 1.2mm
for negative polarity. The R— at 5atm is a distance between the filaments (figure 6 for 5atm
and —46 kV), the distance between the initial streamers being approximately four times smaller. Let us note that this fact does not correlate with a streamer in the air gap, where the diameter
of a streamer of negative polarity is always higher [24], but does correlate with the smaller
‘near-surface’ gap between the streamer of the negative polarity and the surface in numerical
modelling [14]. Transition to filamentary regime, if it exists in the combustible mixtures, can be extremely
important for redistribution of energy in the discharge. At the same time, the physics of this
transition is not yet clear.
