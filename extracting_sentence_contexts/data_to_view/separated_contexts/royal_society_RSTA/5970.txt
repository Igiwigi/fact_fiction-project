If we now additionally assume that the growth rates are all equal and in particular—
since a rescaling of the modulus of r does not affect the feasibility—that they are equal to 1, then
the steady-state components are randomly distributed with mean and variance given by

and Var[x;] = CE = Dor

This shows that the mean value of x7 is always positive and depends only on dg, the other
parameters S, C and o being involved only in the spreading around it. In particular, the larger
the system size S or the connectivity C of the interactions, the more spread are the x7, the more
likely some components are negative. Indeed, as reported in the main text, a good estimator for
the probability for the feasibility condition to hold is given by the quantity

[> N(x; | Elxi], Varlx;)dx; = serfe |- a (B9)
0

This can be seen also considering explicitly the feasibility condition, given by equation (B5),
which in this case becomes

Defining the random variable z; as z; = Yea My, we are interested in estimating its probability
density function p(z;), so that the feasibility condition translates in computing the probability

This can be easily computed by mean of the law of total probability

where p(N)-the probability that the i-th row of M has exactly N non-zero distributed entries over
the S — 1 off-diagonal elements-is a binomial distribution, since the outcome in each entry of M


is a Bernoulli trial with probability C

where the factor N in the variance comes from the fact that z; is the sum of N normally distributed

and since this condition should hold for each row i,
Prob(feasibility|S, d, c, og) = [Prob(z; > —dp)]°. (B 16)

The main advantage of this equation is its closed-form fashion. On the other hand, it becomes
computationally hard to be computed for large S.
