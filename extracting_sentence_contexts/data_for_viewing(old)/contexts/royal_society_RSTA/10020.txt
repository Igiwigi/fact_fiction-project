the pressure at 15, 20, and 25 atmospheres (where the values were roughly double
those required by the readings at other pressures for a linear connection to hold good,
Diagrams I., IIL, V.), it was deemed advisable to re-measure the plates taken at those
pressures. The second measurements agreed well with those originally obtained, but
it was then found possible to measure a few of the strongest lines on another plate,
D18, taken at 25 atmospheres, which had previously been rejected as being too
under-exposed. The fourteen readings obtained from it indicated that the linear
relation would be satisfied at that pressure if they were substituted for the readings
given by photograph D19.

On both the photographs at 25 atmospheres the comparison spectrum was in the
central strip, and as the precautions that had been taken (p. 129) seemed to preclude .
the possibility of an undiscovered fictitious shift, it was decided to investigate the
phenomenon carefully, and to repeat the whole series of photographs.

The photographs of the second set, B, give results more consistent with a linear
connection between the pressure and the displacement (Diagrams IT., IV., VI.), except
in the case of Group III., where the displacements at 20 atmospheres are again too
high, though the readings given by Groups I. and II. agree well with those obtained
at higher pressures in making the function a linear one.

At 5 atmospheres most of the lines of Groups I., Set A, as well as most of the lines
