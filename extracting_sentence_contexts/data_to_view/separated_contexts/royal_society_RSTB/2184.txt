On removing the thumbs from the
artery the fit did not return. More recently RonErmÂ§ stopped by the same means a
unilateral convulsion after all other remedies had failed, and KEtxy|| stopped severe
eclampsia which had continued for 14 hours. These are only a few examples taken at
random to illustrate the fact that the results obtained on man agree with those obtained
by me with absinthe. While sudden compression of the carotid arteries in certain
men, such as Scurry and myself, may excite the cortex and evoke clonic spasms, the
same means, if continued, can be used to paralyse the cortex and cut short an
epileptic fit. If, as is probable, certain forms of epileptic convulsions are produced by
toxins circulating in the blood, such as carbonate of ammonia (KrarnsKy),1 then the
clonus in such cases ought to be cut short by compression of the carotids and return
again on loosening the arteries.
