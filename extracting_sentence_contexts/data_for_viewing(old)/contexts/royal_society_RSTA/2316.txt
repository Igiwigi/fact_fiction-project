(i) The problem of quantum correlations

The problem we address here is identifying the physical reason or principle that explains why
the behaviours that are realizable for Bell and KS scenarios are those that satisfy conditions (I)-
(II). The question we want to answer is where does the ‘irrational effectiveness’ [35] of the
Hilbert space formalism supplemented with Born’s rule for singling out the physically realizable
behaviours come from, why the quantum formalism is empirically successful.

None of the proposed principles (non-signalling [36], non-triviality of communication
complexity [37], information causality [38], macroscopic locality [39], exclusivity [40] and local
orthogonality [41]) has succeeded in selecting the quantum behaviours even in the simplest Bell
scenario. In fact, for every non-trivial Bell scenario, there are non-quantum behaviours which
seem to satisfy all these principles [42].


3. Result

(a) Assumptions
We make the following assumptions:
Assumption 3.1. There is a non-empty set of behaviours for any KS scenario.

Assumption 3.2. There is a statistically independent joint realization of any two
KS experiments.
