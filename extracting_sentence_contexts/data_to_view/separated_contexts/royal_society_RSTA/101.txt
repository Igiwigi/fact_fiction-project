This is legitimate in
a manifestly Lorentz-invariant theory, because what we are really interested in are commutators,
and in such a theory the commutators always vanish outside the light cone. However, it is not
legitimate in Coulomb-gauge electrodynamics, where commutators fall off quite slowly at large
distances. In fact, as was shown explicitly in our paper [26], the operator Q, in this case, not only
fails to be time-independent, but actually does not exist at all as a well-defined operator. This is
now recognized as a characteristic feature of spontaneous symmetry breaking. There is an alternative approach that does preserve relativistic Lorentz invariance.
