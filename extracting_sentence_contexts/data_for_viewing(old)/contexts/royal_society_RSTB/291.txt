creature would present almost exactly the same features as Menobranchus. That
are justified in postulating the disappearance of the distal part of the origi
hyomandibula, is shown by Siren and Menopoma, in which this same cartilage j
scarcely one-fourth the size of that of Proteus, and is moreover confluent with ¢
quadrate. Lastly, such a cartilage appears no longer in Seironota perspicil
(PARKER).

This conception of the hyomandibula is strengthened by the fact that Park
himself is not clear about the origin of the whole “stapes.” His first suggestion tha
the stem of the stapes in Menopoma is equal to the annulus tympanicus of the Frog
is to be found in his work on the Urodela, p. 559, foot-note. On p. 587 he says :—
“By the time the tail has disappeared in the Frog, the primary otic process h
become a free trifoliate ‘ spiracular cartilage’; this becomes the cartilaginous annul
tympanicus ; it is always, at any stage, above the portio dura nerve. In certai
Urodela (Menopoma, Spelerpes, Desmognathus), the two latter being Caducibranc
this cartilage grows to the stapes, and generally fits its narrow posterior end into
cup-shaped process of the stapedial bony centre ; in some it is independently ossified
and free. These two specialisations of that peculiar Selachian spiracular cartilage are
of great interest, suggesting the possibility of many curious transformations
ichthyic elements in the higher classes.”
