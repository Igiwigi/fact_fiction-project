ARGUMENTATIVE INFERENCE RESPECTING THE NATURE OF
Þ LIGHT. The experiment of Gr1MALD1, on the crested fringes within
the shadow, together with several others of his observations,
equally important, has been left unnoticed by NEwToNn. Those
who are attached to the NEwToN1aNn theory of light, or to the
hypotheses of modern opticians, ſounded on views till less en-
larged, would do well to endeavour to imagine any thing like
an explanation of these experiments, derived from their own
doctrines; and, if they fail in the attempt, to refrain at least
from idle declamation against a system which is founded on the
accuracy of its application to all these facts, and to a thousand
others of a similar nature,

From the experiments and calculations which have been pre-
mised, we may be allowed to infer, that homogeneous light, at
certain equal distances'in the direction of its motion, is possessed
of opposite qualities, capable of neutralising or destroying each

other, and of extinguishing the light, where they happen. tobe
united; that these qualities 8ucceed each other alternately in
successive concentric superficies, at distances which are constant
for the same light, passing through the same medium, From the
agreement of the measures, and from the similarity of the phe-
nomena, we may conclude, that these intervals are the same as
are concerned in the production of the colours of thin plates;
but these are shown, by the experiments of NewrTon, to be the
smaller, the denser the medium ; and, since it may be presumed
that their number must necessarily remain unaltered in-a given
quantity of light, it follows of course, that light moves more
slowly in a denser, than in a rarer medium : and this being
granted, it must be allowed, that refraction is not the effect of
an attractive force directed to a denser medium. The adyocates
for the projectile hypothesis of light, must consider which link
in this chain of reasoning they may judge to be the most feeble;
for, hitherto, I have advanced in this Paper no-
