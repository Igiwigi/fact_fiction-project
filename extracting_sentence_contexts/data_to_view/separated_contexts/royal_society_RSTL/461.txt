we find a summary of the experiments that had preceded the
impression of his work, together with the following sentence,
« Tous les muriates-Suroxygents sont decomposes par les acides,
« gouvent avec une violente decrepitation, avec une degagement
«© de yapeur jaune verddtre, et une odeur tres-forte, 'Cette yapeur
« est de veritable acide muriatique suroxygens. Elle est lourde,
« tombe en goutellettes Mun jaune vert, et forme des stries
*« comme de Vhuile, sur les corps auxquels elle adhere.” This
assertion carries no confirmation along with it; and does not
amount 80 near to proof as the position of the former chemist :
80 that, in fact, the existence of hyperoxygenized muriatic acid,
and of its combination with potash, rests, at present, upon the
conjecture/of Mr. BERTHOLLET; 'a conjecture however which,
as well as his'whole dissertation upon the subject, bears all the
marks of genius which so strongly characterise every produc-
tion of that sagacious philosopher. Some notice has been taken
of other saline combinations, formed by causing a current of
oxygenized muriatic acid to pass through solutions of the alkalis,
or earths, or by otherwise combining them. - Mess.
