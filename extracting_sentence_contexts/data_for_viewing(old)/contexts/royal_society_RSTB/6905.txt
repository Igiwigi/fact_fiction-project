with Hertwig’s chromidia, but which Grassé (1926) compares with the parabasal
apparatus, divide independently of and before the division of the nucleus. Some
fifty specimens of form 6, which had been fixed with Schaudinn’s fluid and stained
with iron haematoxylin, were examined, but in no case was any such structure found.
[It may be objected that Schaudinn’s fluid is unsatisfactory as a fixative for para-
basals—as in the case of Trichonympha, for example. Those of Bodo edax, however, are
satisfactorily fixed by sublimate alcohol (Kiihn, 1915). It will be seen later that
specimens of a marine species, B. maris n.sp. fixed with Champy’s fluid, showed no
parabasal apparatus comparable with von Prowazek’s chromidia.] Lemmermann
(1914) remarks briefly that there is a single basal granule united to the nucleus by
a rhizoplast, but gives no authority for this statement. Internal evidence suggests
that he is describing von Prowazek’s figures. Grassé (1926) has suggested that the
bodies described by von Prowazek were in fact the parabasal apparatus, and
accordingly he includes the Bicoecinae along with the Herpetomonadinae, Bodoninae,
Polymastiginae, Hypermastiginae and Distomatinae in the Protomastigina Senn. All
these families are characterized by the presence of a parabasal, almost invariably in
association with the blepharoplast (or basal granule).

Examination of preparations of form 4 shows that there is no parabasal present of
the form described by von Prowazek under the name chromidia. The anterior and
posterior flagella arise from an intensely staining body which is closely applied to the
nucleus. This structure appears to be visible in the living animal shown in figures 20
and 21, plate 26. The relations of nucleus and flagella-are illustrated in the sketches
reproduced in figure 5. For comparison, a figure from von Prowazek (1903) is included.
It is clear that my figures are essentially similar to that of von Prowazek; they differ
