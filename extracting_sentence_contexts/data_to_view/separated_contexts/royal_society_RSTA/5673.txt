The obtained result is consistent
with the instantaneous distributions of shear stresses at different characteristic moments of the
cardiac cycle (figures 12 and 13). We can see that the shear stress decreases most strongly in the
area before stenosis in the LAD branch. This occurs apparently due to the fact that the DA branch
flow near the bifurcation region before and after stenting is the most intense. As a consequence,
larger shear stresses arise on the surface of its walls. The most intense blood flow in the DA branch before stenting is probably due to the anatomical
localization of the stenosis in the affected area and its angle of origin.
