maintain the cohesion and coherence of large groups, while about the correlates of the brain’s information processing
enhanced foraging skills are necessary to maintain these capacity (a functional, or selection, hypothesis) to one about

calorie-hungry brains. the correlates of whether a species has a brain that is smaller


or larger than would be expected for the average species of a
given body size (a developmental question reflecting the
costs of growing a large brain) [120]. Perhaps more impor-
tantly, it leaves us unable to say whether any relationship is
owing to a change in brain size or a change in body size and
may say little or nothing about a species’ cognitive potential
[121,122]. In fact, it has become increasingly clear in recent
years that including body size as a covariate in comparative
analyses can result in unpredictable consequences precisely
because a radically different question is being asked
[123,124]. The lesson is that a great deal more care needs to
be taken in formulating hypotheses than is often exercised.

5. Conclusion

Much of the debate about primate brain evolution focuses on
whether social relationships or ecology best explain patterns
of brain size evolution. An important caveat is that the eco-
logical and behavioural traits we typically focus on in these
