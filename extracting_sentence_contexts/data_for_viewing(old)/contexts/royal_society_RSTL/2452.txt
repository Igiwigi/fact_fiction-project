Greenwich.

We anchored in Porcupine Harbour, where we ftaid until the 26th of September, and from thence proceeded
England; which being a common rout, I ſhall conclude with a few general obſervations on this part of the
world, fo little known and fo terribly repreſented by people who, in order to raiſe their own merit, make dan«
gers and difficulties of common occurrences ; merely becauſe the places are unknown, and there is little or no
probability of their ever being contradicted. I do not mean this as a perſonal reflexion ; but having diſcourſed
with many of the maſters of Greenland veſſels, as well as their employers, and heard ſuch drealful ſtories of
thoſe countries, I cannot help remarking it as a circumſtance equally fooliſh and ridiculous, tending to miſlead
thoſe who from a laudable principle would be benefactors to their country, but are deterred from it by ſuch re-
prefentations ; and J appeal to thoſe feries of facts for the truth of my affertion. The weather in Davis's Straits
is, in the ſpring and autumn, boifterous; the ſeas run jrregular, ke the Gulph of Lions, and other
Places I could inſtance '(that is ſhort and high); occaſioned (I imagine) by the narrowneſs of the Straits, 'the
many impediments it meets with from the ice, and its being open to the ſouthern parts of the Atlantic Ocean,
As the ſouth winds are always the ſtrongeſt, bring thick weathez, and the greateſt ſea, fo the northern ones bring
fine dear weather, and are ſeldom firong. I ſhall here finiſhtheſe obſervations, with the particulars of them,
&c. and ſhall communicate obſervations on the ice, the atmoſthere, the land of Forbiſher, aud the probability
of a north weſt paſſage, in a ſhort time.
