Heisenberg, again, realized that he did not


need a space-time description or any realist representation of quantum objects and processes
to be able to predict the outcomes of the experiments he considered. His decision to forgo

this representation was a daring step, because throughout the history of classical mechanics 3
from Galileo on, and then electromagnetism and relativity, such a representation appeared to be : s
necessary for making successful predictions concerning the behaviour of the systems considered. :<
As explained above, while designed only for making statistical predictions concerning large : 3S
systems of great mechanical complexity, classical statistical physics, too, was only valid under : &

this assumption, which, again, came into conflict with the data (statistical or otherwise) obtained
in experiments with quantum theory, a conflict inherent in Planckâ€™s law. Heisenberg made yet another, equally unexpected, move that proved to be crucial and

in fact enabled him to give the correspondence principle its mathematical form. Quantum : 8
theorists before Heisenberg had tried to change classical equations while keeping the same Dos
physical variables, in part by thinking in representational terms of classical mechanics and in _
order to be able to continue to do so. They saw equations and not variables as the problem. : Sy
Heisenberg reversed this thinking, in view of the mathematical correspondence principle.
