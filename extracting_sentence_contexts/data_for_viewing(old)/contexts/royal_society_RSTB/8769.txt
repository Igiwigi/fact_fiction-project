we studied. Our results support the hypothesis that climate atmospheric climate have led to changes in the upper-ocean
dynamics may have a relevant role. For example, the circulation of the Arctic Ocean between the late 1980s and

second component of the biological state (13.22% of the early 1990s, which in turn have resulted in changes in


North Atlantic circulation (increased discharge of relatively
low-salinity water into the North Atlantic, and redirection
of the shallow, low-salinity outflow from the Arctic Ocean
mainly through the Labrador Sea [41,76]).

The Pacific Ocean circulation is also influenced by the
Arctic circulation [97] and by the AO. In fact, the AO is the
major factor of SST increase over the subarctic North Pacific
in 1988/1989 [98]. Its influence is more conspicuous in the
western subarctic North Pacific than in the eastern North
Pacific, affecting precipitations over Japan [99]. Some studies
have reported AO-related SST change in western North Paci-
fic ecosystems, for example shifts of spawning ground and
biomass of the Japanese common squid (Todarodes pacifics)
in the Japanese Sea [77].

Finally, changes in the Arctic climate system, especially
those affecting sea ice extent, have the potential to influence
global climate through the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
