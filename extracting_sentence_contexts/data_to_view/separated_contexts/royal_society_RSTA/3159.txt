Lemma 3.1. For any jx sufficiently small, the vector field f in (3.6) has the following properties.
(i) The complex-valued map f is of class Ck in a neighbourhood of 0 in C x C x R, for any arbitrary

but fixed k > 2.
(ii) There exists a real-valued map g of class CK! defined in a neighbourhood of 0 in R? such that

f(A, A, 2) = A(IAP, 1),

for any A sufficiently small.
(iii) The coefficients of the leading-order terms in the Taylor expansion of f,

f(A, A, ») = crn + c30AlAP? + OVAI(uI? + IAI), (3.7)
are given by
1 4F? (30a — 41)
c= Q—ay’ C30 (2a)? Proof. (i) This property follows from the fact that the map ” provided by the centre manifold
theorem is of class C*.
(ii) Recall that the dynamical system (3.2) is equivariant under the action of the operators T and
Th, a € R. According to [9, §2.3.3], these equivariances are inherited by the reduced equation (3.6),
so that f satisfies

f(A,A,u)=f(A,A,u) and f(el@A,e~“A, u) =ef(A, A, w),

for any a€R and A sufficiently small. Applying the result in [9, ch. 1, lemma 2.4], the second
equality above implies that f is of the form (3.7) with g a complex-valued function, and then
from the first equality above we conclude that g is a real-valued function.
