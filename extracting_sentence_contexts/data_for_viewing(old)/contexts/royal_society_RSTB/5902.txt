Introduction.

The chemical examination of sea water had shown that, as the spring advanced, the
surface water became more alkaline and its phosphate content much reduced. These
changes were shown to arise from the action of the phytoplankton, and the fact that they
were, in these latitudes, mainly limited to the upper fifteen or twenty metres suggested
that lack of light hindered growth at greater depths.

It was natural to seek for quantitative information on this subject, and as alternatives
the photographic and photo-electric methods presented themselves. The former had
been used to a considerable extent, notably by Grey (1913, 1914). It is specially suited
for detecting very feeble illumination and for showing the depths to which light of
various colours can penetrate. The difficulties and limitations of the method are
obvious when quantitative results are required at lesser depths with relatively intense
light, such as is wanted for photosynthetic processes to be carried on at a rate great
enough to preponderate over respiration. Not the least of such difficulties is imposed
by the condition that the light of the sky, including the sun if uncovered, is normally
