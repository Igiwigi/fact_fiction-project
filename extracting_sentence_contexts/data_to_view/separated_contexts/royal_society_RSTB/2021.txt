Longitudinal sections of Specimen I., cut immediately below the transverse section
from which phot. 4 was taken, show that the anomalous strand fused, in the down-
ward direction, with the adjacent normal stele. This fact may have some relation to
the division of the latter about the same point. In other cases also accessory vascular tissues have been found, which sometimes
take the form of irregular bands, and not of closed rings. These anomalous vascular strands are probably best regarded as extrafascicular new
formations, comparable to the cortical bundles of Cyeas, which they much resemble,
or to the irregular strands which sometimes occur in the extrafascicular region of
Mucrozamia.
