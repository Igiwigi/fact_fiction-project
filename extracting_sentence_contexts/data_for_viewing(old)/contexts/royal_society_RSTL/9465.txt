Theoretical deductions.

It has seemed advisable to keep any theoretical deductions to the concluding portion
of this paper, as the first portion contains wholly facts on which no controversy, I can
imagine, can arise ; at the same time, it would be wanting in candour did I not point
out what seems to me to be some evident conclusions which can be drawn from the
experiments that I have made over such a long period.

IT have pointed out that the form of silver bromide which is sensitive to the red and
ultra-red of the spectrum transmits the least refrangible rays to a marked extent, but
it does nob do 80 entirely ; in fact, we may ay it absorbs all rays, the less refrangible
the best, the more refrangible mach less, and the green rays leasb of all. A very
instructive experiment to repeat is to photograph the spectrum of burning coal-gas
with this 8alt. It will be found that the curve of intensity constructed as already
indicated has the following appearance in he prismatic spectrum.

" . . . = b: od Vi
It shows two well-defined maxima, which are situated somewhere about wave

lengths 3800 and 7600. It may be merely fortuitous that these occupy the position8
they do in the spectrum ; but if we are to look at the occurrence of the maxima ab
intervals, one of which has double the wave length of the other, we cannot but be
strack with the idea that a molecule of the silver bromide is responding to harmonie
