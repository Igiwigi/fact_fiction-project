strongest contrast it is possible for me to conceive. y

I can, of course, never know whether my abstract sensations of these colours are the
same as those of the normal-eyed; but this is of no moment, for we can only judge of
our ideas by their manifestation ; and if I find that I can understand and agree in all
that is said of blue and yellow by the world in general, and that they can also under-

not agree with those of the normal-eyed.

The term red is 80 indefinite, in ordinary language, that I have had much trouble to
