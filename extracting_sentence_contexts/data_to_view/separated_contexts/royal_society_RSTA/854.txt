the direction of motion of
individual wave-crests across the wave-packet is more inclined to the vertical than the
direction of motion of the wave-packet as a whole. When the wave-packet has reached
the point D, individual wave-crests are travelling across it horizontally although the
wave-packet as a whole is still moving upwards. Along the portion DA of the group-ray
the direction of motion of the wave-packet as a whole continues to slope upwards in
spite of the fact that the direction of motion of individual wave-crests across it is now
sloping downwards. After the wave-packet has passed its highest point A, both the
direction of motion of the wave-packet as a whole and the direction of motion of
individual wave-crests across it have downward slopes, which tend to identity as the
wave-packet approaches the point R where it leaves the ionosphere. There is a corre-
sponding interpretation of fig.
