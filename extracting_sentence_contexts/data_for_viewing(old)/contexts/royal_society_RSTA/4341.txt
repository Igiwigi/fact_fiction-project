As is well known, the width and the shape of spectral lines, from an absorbing medium
in the gas phase at thermodynamic equilibrium, provide a variety of quantitative information
on the gas itself, from both the microscopic and macroscopic points of view. In fact, from the
accurate analysis of an absorption profile, it is possible to retrieve the strength of a given line,

from which the transition dipole moment between two quantum states can be inferred, and the : =
line centre frequency, providing direct information on the involved energy levels. Nowadays, : yy
similar data for diatomic and triatomic molecules are of the utmost importance to test the accuracy 2
of new methods and strategies for ab initio calculations [1,2]. Furthermore, if the shape of a : S
given line is accurately recorded as a function of the gas pressure, then line broadening and 22
shifting coefficients can be determined. When dealing with molecules of considerable importance : 8
for atmospheric and climate physics, accurate values of these parameters are necessary for gas DN
monitoring applications [3]. In fact, if the spectroscopic parameters of a particular line of a given : g
species are known (as a function of the gas temperature), then the absorber gas density can if

be accurately determined by using laser absorption spectroscopy [4]. This is a possible way to
determine the vertical profiles of water, carbon dioxide and other trace constituents of the Earth
atmosphere in air- or balloon-borne experiments through punctual (in sifu) measurements at
different altitudes [4].

In the Doppler regime, namely at low gas pressures, the main source of line broadening is the
Doppler effect. This latter leads to the Doppler width of a spectral line, which links the thermal
energy to an optical frequency, according to the following equation:
