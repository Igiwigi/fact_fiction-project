I stop to consider the geometrical interpretation ; introducing dv, the formula

may be written
4. R'(a*+y*)8 dr
a= EPS,

we have (a*+7)R'=1—ar—Py—v/Q, or

(a* +y*)R' _ 1l=an—By _,,

VQ ”Q

1-az—PBy

Ramp. is the perpendicular from the centre of the circle of inversion upon the
TTY

tangent to the dirigent conic, and EIS is the half-chord which this perpendicular
2 #7

forms with the generating circle. Hence = —1=(perpendicular — halt-chord)

—haltf-chord, the numerator being in fact the distance of the element dS (or point X, Y)
from the centre of inversion : the formula thus is

= Ie
d8=+5/. dv,

where 3 is the radius of the generating citcle, g the distance of the element from the

centre of the circle of inversion, and c the chord which this distance forms with the
generating circle. If we consider the two points on the generating circle, and write

—_—_
ds8' for the element, at the other point, then we have (dS+dS')= + S=eED =2 dv

(which is Casey's formula ds'—ds=29g do (273)).
