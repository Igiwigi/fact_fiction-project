In order to prevent
‘the stiffness being such as to seriously affect the sensitiveness, the threads must be
Eery fine, and, consequently, the suspended apparatus very light. In order to go
jeyond this, it becomes necessary to determine to what point the optical sensitiveness
nn profitably be carried—or, what comes to the same thing, the limit of the angular
Salue of the fluctuations of the zero, Under fixed conditions, the weight of the
Shirror will simply depend on the defining power required. The maker must take
Bito account (1) the optical limit as to smallness, depending on the wave-length of
ght; and (2) the fact that the mirror must be thick enough neither to deform under
own weight, nor to deform owing to the freeing of internal stresses during its
Fhanufacture. Before exact theory can be applied to the construction of a galvano-
meter it is, therefore, necessary to fix on the weight of the mirror, and though, with
the experience we have now acquired with magnetically and thermally seveened
instruments, we can form an estimate of the minimum weight of the mirror,
we could not do so before the instrument was constructed. It was necessary, there-
fore, to proceed along the lines indicated by the general principles involved, and to
make such alterations from time to time in the design as increased knowledge
suggested.
