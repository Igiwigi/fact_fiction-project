The length of intestine in the tadpole; when its relative pro=
portion to the size of the animal is considered, exceeds every
thing of the kind that is met with in other animals. In the tadpole of the Surinam frog, the intestine after it has
acquired its full size, does not remain of this enormous length,
beyond the period of its-metamorphosis into the: frog taking
place; and what is deserving' of particular attention, the fat
is deposited, when the intestine has acquired'its full size, and
no s0oner is the intestine reduced in-length, than not only no


go6 Sir EvERARD HoME on the formation of fat

more fat is deposited, but all that was previously formed is
found to have been consumed, in producing the metamor-
phosis into the frog: which leads me to conclude, that such
a deposit of fat is necessary to the metamorphosis of a tad-
pole into a frog, and that such unusual length of intestine, is
required to admit of so large a quantity of fat being formed
in so short a time, and, therefore, that the intestine is the
laboratory in which the fat is formed. To ascertain, whether the necessity of such a supply of fat
is occasioned by the oft parts of the tadpole not being con-
vertible into bones, and other parts of the frog, which did not
exist in the tadpole, or, simply, from a deficiency of materials,
I have had the assistance of my friend and fellow labourer in
animal chemistry, Mr. HaTcaeTT, who some years ago ascer-
tained, that the yelk of an egg is essentially composed of
concrete oil, combined with a small proportion of albumen,
and he has made out the following important facts. Â© That
the spawn of the frog, has no yelk, and contains no oil what-
ever; he also corroborates Mr. Branve's statement, that it
consists of a substance intermediate between albumen and
gelatine, inclining principally to the former. That the ova
of the shell snail, both of those that have a shell, and those
that have only a strong membranous covering, have no yelks,
and consist of albumen, since they coagulate in proof spirit of
wine, and, when 80 coagulated, and examined some time
afterwards, appear not to contain any oil.
