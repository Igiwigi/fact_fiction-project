This beam pipe is now being analysed in a similar way to the MMT material, i.e.
by using a hyper-sensitive SQUID magnetometer that is capable of detecting single Dirac charged
monopoles in the material.


3. New experiments at the Large Hadron Collider

The studies of ATLAS, CMS, LHCb and MoEDAL for LLPs have not led to the discovery of a
positive signal yet. While these studies were ongoing it was also realized that, in fact, the present
LHC detectors could have very low detection for a number of LLP scenarios, or even totally
miss them. This has led to proposals for possible new small-scale additional experiments for the
LHC, to cover these possible gaps. Indeed, the LHC will continue to run and produce protonâ€”
proton (and nucleus-nucleus) collisions for another 20 years or so, with increasing luminosity
performance with time.
