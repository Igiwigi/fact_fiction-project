downwards in front of the vertical limb of the preecentral sulcus. The following
movements here form the march :—

1. Turning of the head to the opposite side.

2. Opening of the eyes wide.

8. Turning of the eyes to the opposite side,

And are represented in the following centres, 19 to 28) inclusive. At the centres
below w the opening of the eyes occurred earlier in the march than is just stated.

We would here direct special attention to the fact that occasionally the representa-
tion of the movements of the head and eyes is continued downwards, in front of the
preecentral sulcus as far as its lower extremity, this area being limited in front by the
subordinate sulcus (often very slightly marked) in the inferior frontal convolution,
which probably represents the anterior limb of the Sylvian fissure.

We believe that it was owing to the very large proportion of negative results (7.¢.,
recorded nil) observed in stimulating this region, that, Dr. Ferror was led to consider
it (i.e., the part below the sulcus w) inexcitable. ;

We, however, find from a large number of observations that it is really excitable,
although not invariably so. Of course, too, this excitability diminishes from above
downwards, Not only is the representation in this region relatively less, but also the
