Many years later, in breakthrough work, Gutzwiller derived his famous
race formula [51,63]. It associates the quantum spectra density of states with
he periodic orbits of the classical problem. Without going into detail, the
exact mathematical form of such an expression (in fact, of its pre-exponential
amplitudes) is different if one has either a fully chaotic or a completely integrable
classical dynamics [64]. So, the whole issue is that from a formal point of view,
he semiclassical description in QM presents mathematical distinctions for the
chaotic and integrable cases. Let us now recall the correspondence principle.
