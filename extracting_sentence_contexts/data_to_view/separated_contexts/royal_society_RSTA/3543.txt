The good agreement with
the results from the combined FAS/KMC simulations illustrates the validity of fitting the key
quantities in the AMC, #; and zj, with the analytic functions in equations (2.10) and (2.11). In this
particular case, the AMC approach is actually computationally more expensive than the direct
KMC simulations. This is due to the fact that there is no large barrier for the escape from the
superbasin states, i.e. the system is not trapped in these states, and the effusion can also readily
happen in the KMC simulations. The time-consuming part of the AMC algorithm is the inversion
