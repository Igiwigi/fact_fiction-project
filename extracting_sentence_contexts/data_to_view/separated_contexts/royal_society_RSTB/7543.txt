It remains to consider the effects of the wind as a direct stimulus acting on settled locusts. When the locust is resting on the ground it has a fixed standard of reference and is therefore
in a position to sense and respond to the direct mechanical pressure of the air even when the
wind is quite smooth. This may well account for the fact that locusts taking off in any
appreciable wind are nearly always observed to be oriented into it. It was observed that a sudden lull after a period of strong wind led to mass taking-off by
settled locusts (pp. 178-181). Since locusts have a powerful tendency to fly spontaneously,
the mass taking-off observed as soon as the suppressing influence of strong wind is removed
doubtless represents the release of their spontaneous flight activity.
