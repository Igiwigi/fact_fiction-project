The integral of the product of a tesseral function and of a power of sin 6 having
been obtained in § 4, the above integrals are found by expanding the tesseral
function or the zonal harmonic in a series proceeding by powers of sin 0,

From the expression of a tesseral function of degree 1 and type o, as it is generally
given, viz:

sin’ O[ Agu"? + Agu" +...)

it is seen by writing « = sin 0, p = \/1 —z*, and expanding the binomials, that the
term of lowest power will be sin’ #, and that if i —o be even, the term of highest
power is sin" 0. The coefficients of the series, which are given by HErNx, are most easily obtained
by going back to the differential equation :

n (mI) QE + TE (= =H) =e.

If the series

satisfies this differential equation, the coefficients a,,. and a, must be connected by
the relation

y(n — q)(n-+g+ I+ Gar(¢-o+2)(a+o4 2)=0,
as is seen by substitution. The first coefficient is determined by the fact that it is equal to the value of

other coefficients may now be determined in terms of this, and we find in this way
