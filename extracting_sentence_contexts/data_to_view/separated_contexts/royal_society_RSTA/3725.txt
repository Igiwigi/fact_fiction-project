This work was conceived in A.S.â€™s diploma thesis (University of Bonn,
2005). Symmetrizing the spectral line shapes of the resonances for device applications was aided by
using the simple and intuitive design features of the presented complex transmission model in
the complex plane. In fact, we can symmetrize the observed spectral waveguide resonances by
choosing the thickness of the waveguide layer appropriately. Competing interests. The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
