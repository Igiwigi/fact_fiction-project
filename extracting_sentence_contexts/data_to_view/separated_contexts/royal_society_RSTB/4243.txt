The reply to this criticism is to be found in protocols of experiments published
later (p. 267); unless there is very extensive damage or complete transection of the
left division the distribution to the left ventricle as gauged by the extracardial
leads remains unaltered. The second criticism which may be raised is that in several
applications of the clamp the main stem of the bundle is almost certain to suffer some
damage. Asa matter of fact, in one series of my curves 2:1 block was present ;
evidently in this cireumstance the impulse was still of auricular origin, and the
spread was therefore still through the usual Purkinje channels. I possess similar
curves from this animal in which there was no block, but the curves, being tremulous,
were less suitable for measurement, though of the same outline. Criticism applies
chiefly to the other experiment in which complete heart-block was present (fig. 2,
and Plate 18, fig. 12).
