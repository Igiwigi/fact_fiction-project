The induced contraction still sabsists even if a thin sheet of felt imbued
with the above-mentioned liquids is interposed between the muscle and the nerve. The slight conductibility of some of the liquids made use of (oil, oil of turpentine,
varnish, &c.) has made me doubt whether the induced contraction would not subsist
even in 8pite of the interposition of an absolutely insulating body. I assured myself, in
fact, that across a layer, even very thin, of the said liquids, neither the muscular cur-
rent nor the proper one was propagated. On holding the galvanoscopic frog in the
hand, and causing its nerve to come into contact with a wetted paper that in any
manner communicates with the ground, the contraction, as is well-known, is obtained. The same thing happens on touching with the nerve of the galvanoscopic frog, the
muscles either of a frog or of any other animal in communication with the earth.
