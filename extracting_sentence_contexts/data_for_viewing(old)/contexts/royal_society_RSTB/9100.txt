had set up an ophthalmoscope for viewing the eyes of jumping spiders, which
he was then studying, and it happened that the day very soon came round on
which hordes of Alumni descended on the School of Optometry and were enter-
tained and instructed in demonstrations and lectures. Mike’s ophthalmoscope
was put on display, and my office was close to the door from which they
emerged from his demonstration, so I overheard the comments and conversa-
tions of the visitors, and sometimes took part in them. They had hugely
enjoyed what Mike had shown them and told them about spider vision, and
most of them obviously recalled enough optics to understand something about
what was on view. The atmosphere was euphoric, and I gained the impression
that Mike had shown many sceptical American optometrists that the straightfor-
ward pursuit of knowledge for its own sake is certainly an interesting, enjoyable
and possibly worthy occupation, in spite of the fact that the research was clearly
not being done for its potential commercial rewards.

All that I have mentioned so far happened almost 50 years ago. Some of
Mike’s research over the following years is recounted in the book he wrote
with D-E Nilsson, published in 2002, and already a classic with a new edition
out last year. This work alone would have represented a major lifetime achieve-
ment, and this is confirmed by the numerous honours and awards he has
received. However, in the last decade or so he has turned his attention in a
new direction—he has found out much about how we move our own eyes in
performing everyday tasks such as making a cup of tea, playing table tennis
or sight-reading a page of music, and I note that nowadays there seems to be
a major international meeting on this topic every year.
