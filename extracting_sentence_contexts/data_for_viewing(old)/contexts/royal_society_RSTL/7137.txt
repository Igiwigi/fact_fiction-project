Joes on as long as it acts, generating a self-persistent state of the current, which
Fe may call (from mechanical analogy) its electromagnetic momentum, and that this
anomentum depends on circumstances external to the conductor, then both induction of
&urrents and electromagnetic attractions may be proved by mechanical reasoning.

B What TI have called electromagnetic momentum is the same quantity which is called

Sy FarapDarÂ® the electrotonic state of the circuit, every change of which involves the
Jetion of an electromotive force, just as change of momentum involyes the action of
Anechanical force.

Tf, therefore, the phenomena described by Farapar in the Ninth Series of his Expe-
rimental Researches were the only known facts about electric currents, the laws of
AwretRE relating to the attraction of conductors carrying currents, as well as those
of FaraDary about the mutual induction of currents, might be deduced by mechanical
reasoning.

In order to bring these results within the range of experimental verification, I shall
next investigate the case of a single current, of two currents, and of the six currents
in the electric balance, s0 as to enable the experimenter to determine the yalues of
