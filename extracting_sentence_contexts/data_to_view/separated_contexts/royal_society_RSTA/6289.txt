Here, it is worth differentiating claims about the need for communicative intent from claims [2
about the need for an external world more generally. (Perception is the most obvious example : >
of the latter category, but there are other examples, e.g. an agent’s non-communicative goals.) :8
Arguments against LLMs often entangle both into a generic notion of grounding, but these claims : -
are not the same. They inherit from separate philosophical traditions and thus have separate sets : <
of criticisms to address. (cf. [71,72] who present partially overlapping arguments with the ones I _
make below.) : 8

(i) Does meaning require communicative intent? 8

A common line of argument is that LLMs cannot encode meaning because they lack
communicative intent. That is, when humans mean things by language, it is by virtue of the fact
that they are using language to influence others’ thoughts and actions. This notion of meaning
originates from [73] who argues that meaning is dependent on the way in which words are used. This perspective is appealing to natural language processing researchers because it is (one of)
the possible theoretical traditions that is consistent with the distributional hypothesis [74,75] on
which nearly all modern computational models of language are based.
