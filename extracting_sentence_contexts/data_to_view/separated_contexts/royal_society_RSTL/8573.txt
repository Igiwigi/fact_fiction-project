The region where teeth are being developed in a colubrine venomous snake, the
Indian cobra, is strikingly different. There is no double series, but the successional
teeth are disposed in a single series, just like the teeth of a harmless snake, or the man-
dibular or pterygoid teeth of a poisonous snake. In fact the description which I gave
in a former paper of the manner in which the teeth of the harmless Ophidia are deve-
loped would apply strictly to the poison-fangs of a cobra, save only that the individual
tooth-germs are modified to form canaliculated teeth. In fig. 5 there is seen a line of inflected epithelium (9g) running in from the oral
epithelium (@); this, which goes to form the enamel-organs of successive germs, is lost
sight of behind the first successional tooth-germ (2); its free extremity, already slightly
dilated near where it will form a fresh enamel-organ, is seen at f. The section, having
been taken a little behind the erect poison-fang already in use, shows no trace of this ; but
sections including the working tooth do not in the cobra show much of its s8uccessors,
which lie behind it and are recumbent, whilst it is erect.
