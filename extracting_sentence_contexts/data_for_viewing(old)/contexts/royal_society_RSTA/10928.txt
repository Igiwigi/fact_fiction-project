defect, but which we have verified. The first long halt gradually rounding to
steepness is due to the almost isothermal solidification, the latent heat of solidification
ceasing to be evolved when the temperature has fallen to 700°; this gives us very
roughly the position of the solidus, The singularity of the curve lies in the second
halt. Here there is a sudden rise due to causes analogous to surfusion, the heat
evolved being the latent heat of transformation of the solid y into plates of Cu,Sn.
The short flat which follows the surfusion is unlike anything else in the cooling
curves. It is due, we think, to a third evolution of heat rapidly following the
second. We can only attribute this to the transformation of the residual y into a
mixture of Cu,Sn and liquid, a reaction that becomes much more marked in the
succeeding alloys. If this be the right explanation of the singularity, then the
reaction occurs at a slightly higher temperature than in the case of alloys
with more tin. This, again, may be due to the fact that when the change,
y = Cu,Sn + liquid, takes place in Sn 26, there are already crystals of Cu,Sn in the
alloy which may serve as nuclei and precipitate the reaction. In order to verify this
cooling curve we repeated it with a different pyrometer and a fresh sample of alloy,
and found the same phenomenon.

Sn 27. 40°8 per cent. of tin.

In the cooling curve of this alloy the second and third halts are completely merged
into one. In fact, the solidus and the liquidus meet very near here at the
temperature of the G point, and the possibility of a uniform solid solution ceases,
The meeting of these two curves at the G temperature is, as Professor Roozesoom
has pointed out to us, a theoretical necessity.
