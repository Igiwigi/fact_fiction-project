I have already (1899, b) insisted upon
the absence of a true optic cup, comparable to that of the lateral eyes, in the pineal
eye, but it seems necessary to do so again as I have been made responsible for a
somewhat misleading figure in the latest edition of W1EDERSHEIM’s ‘ Comparative
Anatomy.’ The separation between the lens and the retina is remarkably sharply defined in
the adult, considering that both are formed from an originally continuous and
uninterrupted layer, the wall of the optic vesicle. The distinction between the two
is emphasised by the fact that the retina gradually thins out to almost a sharp edge
as it approaches the lens, and this edge meets a somewhat similar edge which marks
the junction between the outer and inner surfaces of the lens. The cavity of the
optic vesicle has the form of a deep cup, and the lens may be compared to a stopper
placed in its mouth (figs. 2, 3, 7).
