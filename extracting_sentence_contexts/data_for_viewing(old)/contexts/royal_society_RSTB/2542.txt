Gleicheniacew.—Gileichenia is monostelic. The leaf-traces of this genus are some-
what interesting. Photograph 30, Plate 4, represents the foliar bundle of Gleichenia
flabellata. It presents no special feature except the absence of phloem on the inside
of the incurved stele. Photograph 31, Plate 4, shows the structure of the foliar
bundle in Gleichenia circinata variety microphylla. Here the concentric foliar stele
has become completely closed and shuts in a mass of brown sclerenchyma. ‘This tissue
on longer communicates in any way with the similar cortical tissue outside. We have
thus in the leaf-trace of the Gleicheniaceze a phenomenon similar to that occurring in
the cauline central cylinder of the Osmundaces, viz., the disappearance of internal
phloem together with the complete shutting in of an extrastelar mass of paren-
chymatous tissue. In this case there can be no reasonable doubt that the condition
represented by Gileichenia flabellata is more primitive. We owe the discovery of
the facts described here to Porrauur. (‘Recherches sur les Cryptogames Vas-

culaires.” ‘Ann. d. Sci. Nat., Bot.’ 7 Ser., vol. 18.) Porrauur has also described the
central cylinder of the stem in Platyzoma microphylla. It closely resembles that ot
Osmunda cinnamomea since it is a collateral stelar tube with an internal endodermis.
There is, however, no brown sclerenchyma present in the pith, Through the kind-
ness of Dr. D. H. Scorr the writer has had the opportunity of examining some
sections ot a dried stem of this species. The foliar gaps are nearly degenerate
