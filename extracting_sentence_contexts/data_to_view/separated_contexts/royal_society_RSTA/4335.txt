In our evaluation, we consider a certain
subarea with dense AP deployment depicted in figure 5a, and substitute SBSs for WiFi APs. This
is a reasonable approximation for pico-cells, since the radius of the latter usually resembles that
of the WiFi APs (approx. 100 m). Importantly, owing to the fact that operators typically keep the
datasets of mobility across their base stations confidential, it would be difficult to acquire such
information. By contrast, the trace we use is publicly available online. In order to model the user
demand for content, we use a measured trace of YouTube requests from a study performed at
Amherst campus, University of Massachusetts, in 2008 [52].
