however, described the bundles of C. micromyela as being universally without centri-
petal wood, and in this particular the two species are alike; Lianrer’s species,
however, has large and conspicuous gum canals, and is not like B. mawimus in
general.

Ramenta.—The characteristic Bennettitalean multicellular ramenta have been so
fully described for other species and so well figured by WreLanp (1906) that there
is no need to particularise them in the present species. They are, however, rather
exceptionally numerous, as can be judged by the large areas occupied by masses of
them in the transverse section of the main trunk, where they occupy a greater area
than the leaf-bases they surround (see Plate 23, fig. 1).

This is perhaps correlated with the fact that the cones are exceedingly young, and
the plant was thus. petrified in this undeveloped state, viz., at a time when the
protective scales must have been at the height of their usefulness, and consequently
proportionately bulky.

THE ConEs.

In the small part of the trunk drilled out to be cut in series for the fructifications,
two cones are present, which, for convenience of description I shall call cone X and
cone Y. Photographs of these two cones, and the leaf-bases among which they lie,
