The
greater the reducing Power of the plant, the more nearly will the tendency of its mole-
cular forces approximate to an evolution of hydrogen which, in the presence of free
Nitrogen aissolved in the fluids of the cell, may tend to form ammoniacal compounds,
to be, on the return of light, appropriated by the plant in the exercise of its growing
functions. Tn connexion with this point, it may be here mentioned that in our inyesti-
gation of the gases given off by plants under different circumstances, we have had an
evolution of oxygen one day as a coincident of growth, and an evolution of hydrogen

the sunlight, the gre

the next as the result of decomposition. 5
riments in which the plants have been manured with limited amounts of

enable us to meet some of the questions aboye
the conditions of soil, atmosphere,

Our expe
combined Nitrogen will not only
snggested, but they will also prove whether or not
temperature, &c., to which our experimental plants have be
with active and vigorous growth. The fact of the evolution of Nitrogen in the decompoxsition of nitrogenous organic
matter, illustrated in Sub-section D, p. 497 et 8eq., indicated the danger of using Such
matter as a source of supply of Nitrogen. We have therefore used solutions of sul-
phate of ammonia (se Appendix, p. 542), by means of which we have been enabled t9
supply the plants with known quantities of combined Nitrogen at pleasure, as the pro-
gress of growth scemed to require. Tn the following Table (XLV.) are given the numerical results of the experiments 0h
the question of the assimilation of free Nitrogen in which the plants were supplied with
combined Nitrogen beyond that contained in the 8eed 80Wn.
