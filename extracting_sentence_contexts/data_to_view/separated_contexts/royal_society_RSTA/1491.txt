On substitution of (10.9) in (10.5) we obtain
for the x, y a periodic solution of parameter co. Now from §§ 6, 7 we know that the
equations (10.1) possess formal periodic solutions precisely of the nature we have been
constructing, and we infer that these solutions must be obtainable from (10.9) by
restricting the «,, 8,, (¢ — v) to satisfy (10.15), (10.16). In fact the conditions (10.15),
(10.16) render (10.9) a periodic solution, just as in §§ 6, 7 the conditions

make (5.20) a periodic solution of (5.1). We see that x,, 6, correspond respectively to
%, UW, and that the conditions (10.15), (10.16) correspond to the conditions (10.17).
