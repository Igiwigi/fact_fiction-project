confirmation of the existence of a mechanical resonance.

(3) Correlation between wing and haltere frequencies

v. Buddenbrock (1919) was the first author to point out the error of previous statements
that there is a rigid correlation between the frequencies of oscillation of the wings and
halteres. He showed, in Tipula, that if the area of the wings is reduced by section of the
tips, the wing-beat frequency is raised but that of the halteres is unchanged. Sellke (1936)
performed the complementary experiment of reducing the haltere frequency by loading
the stalk while leaving the wing-beat frequency unchanged. On the other hand, the state-
ment made by both Braun (1939) and Sellke (1936) that the movements of flight have no
effect on the haltere is not strictly true. Some explanation is required of the undoubted
fact that in the normal fly the two frequencies are identical.

In Diptera, as in most insects, the main movement of the wings is produced by distortion
of the whole of the skeleton of the thorax by vertical and longitudinal indirect muscles.
That this has an effect on the halteres is shown by the following experiments on Calliphora:

(a) The same depression of the wings as is caused by contraction of the indirect vertical
muscles may be produced by laying an anaesthetized fly on its back and pressing on the
sternum with the point of a blunt needle. This simultaneously raises the haltere.

(6) Ifa normal fly supported on a wire waxed to the top of the thorax is observed with
a stroboflash lamp, it can be seen that the wings and halteres move in anti-phase.
