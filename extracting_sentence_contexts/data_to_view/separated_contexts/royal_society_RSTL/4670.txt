It is often not easy to decide whether a structure is muscular, and doubts may
arise as to the real nature of the two fibrous laminz of the membrana tympani. My
own researches do not seem to favour the view of that membrane being a contractile
tissue. The facts which seem to militate against the idea of its being muscular are,â€”

Ist. The absence of distinct nuclei in the fibres.

2nd. Their great denseness and hardness, their firm and unyielding structure,
they being s0 strong that it is with some difficulty they can be torn across.
