than that usually recorded by previous observers. It is to be remembered that we,
unlike most investigators at great altitudes, had not been subjected to any physical
exertion. The importance of this condition is shown by the fact that in all of us
throughout our stay on the Peak any considerable physical exertion induced an
acceleration of the pulse much greater than would have occurred at sea-level. Thus
four days after arrival we found that two minutesâ€™ rapid walking up the railway (grade
1 in 4) brouhgt the pulse of HanpAne to 132 per minute, that of HeNpERsoN to
144, and that of Scunerper to 156. This effect appeared most markedly in new-
comers and especially in those inclined to be mountain-sick.
