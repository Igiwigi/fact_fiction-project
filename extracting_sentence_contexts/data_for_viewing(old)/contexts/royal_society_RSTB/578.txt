with the sur-angular bone. There appears, therefore, to be a necessity for the preser-
vation of parts which correspond to the dentary and sur-angular and angular elements.
But I see no such necessity for the preservation of the splenial bone, which in Crocodiles
is little more than a long scale on the inner side of the dentary, or of the coronoid
bone which is internal in position to the coronoid process; so that I suppose the
three successive bones on the inner side of the Reptilian lower jaws to become lost in
the Mammal, and the three external bones to become united and preserved as one
continuous ossification. It may be within the limits of possibility that, after the
articular bone was lost, the angular bone on which it rests also disappeared from the
changed mechanical conditions which affected its ossification, and that the dentary
bone, extending backward at its expense, may have eventually invested the outlet
for Mecket’s cartilage before its union with the sur-angular bone was obliterated.
Therefore there are facts which seem to point to a loss of some elements from the
Reptilian jaw by absence of ossification, and other facts which render the union of the
remaining bones by a loss of segmentation highly probable.

Classification,

It would be premature at present to do more than recognize the larger groups into

which the Anomodontia may be divided. Among such sub-ordinal divisions are the
following :—
