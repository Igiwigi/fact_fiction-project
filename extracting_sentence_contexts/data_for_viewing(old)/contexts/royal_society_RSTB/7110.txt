Gruvel (1905, p. 392) quotes Nussbaum as regards the blood system and adds ideas of his own,
but does not mention Darwin. He admits the existence of the rostral sinus but considers that from
this space blood can either pass down the peduncle or laterally to irrigate the peripheral parts of the
body. From the lateral spaces blood is said to pass to each cirrus. After passing up the cirrus it
passes down and enters an epineural space. ‘This ventral space extends forwards, around the
oesophagus and then connects up to a big space around the adductor muscle and this last space is in
direct communication with the rostral sinus.’ I feel that this is entirely conjectural, for Gruvel does
not give any descriptions or illustrations in support of his ideas. As I see it, he has the circulation
entirely the wrong way round. One morphological mistake upsets his mechanism. The epineural
sinus ends blindly in front and does not extend forwards around the oesophagus. Also it is from the
epineural space into the cirri, and not the reverse, which, as I shall show later, represents the direction
of blood flow. The big blood space which he describes around the adductor muscle does not, in fact,
exist.

More recently Broch 1927 (in Kiikenthal, p. 518) has published a short statement on the cirripede
blood system. He adds nothing except a statement that in the ‘more highly organised forms’ blood
collects in a ventral sinus on either side, which opens in the rostral sinus. He gives no evidence for
this state of affairs, and I know of none.

Beyond stating that a cirripede does not possess a heart, Darwin (1851, p. 46) did not
commit himself as to how the blood gets round the body. Most subsequent workers,
however, state that the body movements are responsible for the circulation. Thus, Broch
(1927, p. 518) says that the contraction of the rostral sinus is brought about by the general
body movements. Gruvel (1905, p. 392) says the same, but adds significantly that the
