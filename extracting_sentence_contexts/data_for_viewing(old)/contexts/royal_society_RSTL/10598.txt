Qrepresents the direct effects of the manure. The subsequent results on plot 2 show
the effects of the discontinuance of the manure, and the gradual approximation to the
Zunmanured condition, The results for plot 1 show the modifications induced during,
Sor after the cessation of the application of dung, when ammonia-salts were also
applied.
D Tt will be observed that, in the first separation-year, the number of species was very
Smnch lower on the manured plots than on the unmanured one ; and it was lower with
-Sthe greater luxuriance, and the consequent more active struggle, where the ammonia-
:Ssalts were applied.
'S After the cessation of the application of the dung, the number of species increased
Son both plots ; but very much more without than with the ammonia-salts. Thus, the
numbers were, in the four separation-years, on plot 2â€”30, 41, 47, and 52, and on plot 1,
Swith the ammonia-ealts, 28, 34, 36, and 34. In fact, under the influence of the residue
Sof the dung alone the number of species rapidly increased, and finally reached that
Swithout manure ; whilst, with the ammonia-salts in addition, the increase was com-
Eparatively very slight, and in the last separation-year there were 18 fewer species
=than without manure, or with the residue of the dung on plot 2, The reduction in the
number, under the influeuce both of the direct application of the dung, and of that of
DS the ammonia-salts, was almost exclusively in miscellaneous species ; and the great
Srelative deficiency of these in the later years, where the ammonia was supplied, is a
Eotriking illustration of the effects of increasing the luxuriance of the grasses in
pacing their competitors.

We have thus far given an outline of the differences between the amounts of produce,
the yield of some constituents, and the general botanical character of the herbage, on
