Now if we divide (102) by /*(0), use (100), and introduce the functions g(x) = [_f(x)/f(0)]8,
the equations (102) transform into the system of linear equations

als) S9'e(i) =e) Eel),
which have the only solution
e(x) = g(x) =[f()//(0)]°. (103)
This form of the conditions that ¢(x) must satisfy is very convenient for numerical calculations. The potential energy U, and therefore the surface roughness s = 2U/¢, can also be written
in a general form. In fact, the energy corresponding to the configuration of figure 20 is

¥{lij| + ik] +]é—-1| + |i—m
and therefore the potential energy per molecule U of the surface will be

1gXf{li—j|+|i—A| +] 1-1] + |i—m |} a(t 3, &, bm)
U= 32 TPs, bl, m) i

where the summations are carried out over all values of i, j, k, /, m. Using (98) and (100)
the potential energy or the surface roughness can be written in the form

s= dp Ind fA) (105)
