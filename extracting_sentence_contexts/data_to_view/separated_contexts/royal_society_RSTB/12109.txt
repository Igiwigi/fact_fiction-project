13. Aristotle: both epigenesis and preformation

As Devin Henry has pointed out [19], the autonomous devel-
opment of a new animal from the material of an apparently
formless egg can only be a source of wonder, whether
considered from the point of view of an ancient Greek, a
seventeenth century physician, or even a present-day citizen. Rejecting magic or miracles, two obvious explanations
for such an astounding event are available: the first,
essentially teleological idea of preformation is that the mor-
phogenetic process requires a pre-existing template that
imposes form on the materials of the developing embryo
(i.e. morphogenesis is the result of preformation); the alterna-
tive, apparently mechanistic explanation of epigenesis is that
morphogenesis is the result of untutored interactions between
the materials of which the embryo is composed (i.e. the for-
mation of the offspring is due to spontaneous self-assembly
from its material parts).
