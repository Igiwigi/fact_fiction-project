substitution rates [43,44]. Additional empirical estimates of
not only mtDNA ‘MRs’, but mtDNA copy number and vari-
ation in the size of the genetic bottlenecks during cell
division, will be critical for disentangling the interactive
effects of mutation, selection and drift on rates of change in
the mitochondrial genome [45].

5. Conclusion

The rate of mutation in the mtDNA is a foundational par-
ameter in biology. Although, in principle, mtDNA MRs
depend only on the rate of replication mistakes and unre-
paired DNA damage, the fact that there are multiple copies
of the mtDNA genome per mitochondrion and multiple
mitochondria per cell means that the fate of a given mutation
in the cell also depends on its selective coefficient and the effi-
cacy of selection to act upon that mutation, relative to the
likelihood that it will be lost or fixed by genetic drift. Thus,
in order to accurately measure mtDNA rates, one must take
a synthetic view of this parameter and meet the challenge

of estimating its component parts. In addition, it is essential
that we obtain not only estimates just for a single genotype
from a few model species, but expand our empirical assays
to include non-model organisms and multiple genotypes
