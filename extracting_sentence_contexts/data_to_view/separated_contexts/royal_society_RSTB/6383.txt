To give an example: subculture 8’ (line A) showed on 20 March an average diameter
of 19-24, and an average length of the double cells of 139-64”. The average diameter
of cells forming auxospores in the same culture was 19-3, the combined length of the
arms 161-54. This increase in length is most probably not due to actual growth, an elongation
of the membrane by the formation of new intercalary bands—although such a process
may occur occasionally (see p. 28)—but to the fact that the two halves of the shell
separate farther apart than in cell division. As described on p. 4 cell division and for-
mation of the new valves takes place while the parental membrane remains intact, the
hypotheca being overlapped by the epitheca. In auxospore formation the growth of
the protoplast continues and the thecae are gradually pushed apart.
