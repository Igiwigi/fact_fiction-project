I do not think, however, that we can fairly infer anything
with regard to the variation of the specific heat at constant pressure from that at
constant volume. The value of the latter can only be deduced by the aid of very
uncertain data, and we have as yet no sure theoretical guide as to the way in which

a it ought to vary, apart from experiments on the specific heat at constant pressure. The most remarkable facts about the specific heat of water are its great constancy
f. over a considerable range, and its high value as compared with that of the solid or
"g the vapour. The specific heat of liquid mercury is nearly the same as that of the
= solid, and both are about double that of the vapour at constant volume. The
& specific heat of water is double that of ice, and nearly three times that of steam at
constant volume.
