By multiplied experiments of a similar character executed subsequently, and fortified
by others made in a different way, all doubts as to the real ordeal to which the germs
had been exposed were set at rest. A flood of light, moreover, was thrown upon the
difficulties recorded in the foregoing pages. Prior to the introduction into our labo-
ratory of the particular samples of desiccated hay whose adherent, germs had manifested
8uch extraordinary powers of resistance, infusions of all kinds, even those of hay itself,
were sterilized with ease and certainty. But the old London, the old Heathfield, the
Guildford, and the old Colchester hay brought a plague into our atmosphere, and thus

Q the infusions of other snbstances, some samples of hay included, became the victims of a
> pest entirely foreign to themselves. The failure to sterilize cucumber, turnip, beetroot,
Zartichoke, melon, beef, mutton, haddock, herring, sole, was plainly due to the fact that,
& their infusions had been prepared in an atmosphere, or brought into contact with vessels,
= contaminated with germs which have been here shown capable of resisting 240 minutes'
boiling. Tt is obvious from all this that to speak of an infusion being rendered barren
Sby such or such a temperature, is simply to use words without definite meaning ; because
'Sthe temperature at which any infusion is sterilized depends upon the character and
Zcondition of the germs which find access to it. 'The death-temperature, for example,
So be more than three hours in London and less than three minutes at Kew®.

I may cite here two conspicuous illustrations of the infective energy of those desiccated
Shay-gor ms in two infusions which, under ordinary atmospheric conditions, are very easily
Sxtorilized. On the 30th of March five pipette-bulbs were charged with clear beet-
Einfusion and boiled for the following times :—
