Ultimately, this is motivated by the fact that elements in a system can
exhibit behaviour, dynamics or functions that would not take place if they were partitioned or
isolated from the rest of the system. One such measure that captures how much information is
lost by partitioning individual elements off from a given system is Integrated Information Theory
[54,55]. However, the mere fact that joint sets of elements behave differently compared to isolated
elements in terms of effects or information flow does not by itself capture what is lost by reduction
to some lower scale of explanation. IIT contains an explicit built-in distinction between ‘whole
vs. parts’ emergence and ‘macro vs. micro’ emergence (the latter is when some supervenient
model of the system is compared to its underlying model, such as a higher scale to a lower
scale) [16]. There are also extensions of IIT, such as the ‘integrated information decomposition’ (ID)
[40,56].
