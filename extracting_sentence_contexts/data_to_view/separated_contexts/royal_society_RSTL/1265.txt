My DEar SIR,

[| SHOULD Sooner have communicated the account, which you
are 50 good as to request, of my further experiments on the
decomposition of ammonia, if I had not been anxious to obtain,
by frequent and careful repetition of them, results not affected
by any of those numerous causes of error, which easily insi-
nuate themselves into processes of so much delicacy. You
have already been informed that the fact, which T lately men-
tioned to you, (tending to prove the existence of oxygen as
an element of the volatile alkali, by the discovery of oxygen
gas in the products of its analysis ) is not entitled to confidence,
owing to the admission of a small quantity of atmospherical
air, in a way which was not at all suspected. Frequent repe-
titions of the same process, under circumstances wholly un-
objectionable, have fully satisfied me, that no portion what-
soever of oxygen gas is evolved by electricity from ammonia,
even when, by means of an apparatus constructed for the

new observations were added and some corrections furnished by the author, in con-
sequence of subsequent experiments made in June; it was transmitted to the Secre-
