A forager sets an acceptance threshold (red dashed line) above which it will visit flowers
(because they are more likely to be rewarding) and below which it will reject them (because they are more likely to be rewardless). When PDFs overlap,
there will be two regions of error: accepting a flower that is rewardless (‘false alarm’ or type | error, indicated by purple darker hatching) and rejecting a
flower that is rewarding (‘missed detection’ or type Il error, indicated by blue lighter hatching). The forager’s challenge is to set an optimal acceptance threshold
to minimize both errors. (Online version in colour.)

parameter, which can be conceptualized as a composite signal likely that in nature, they do in fact adjust their acceptance
whose level indicates whether the flower is rewarding or thresholds. For example, bumblebees increase their preference
rewardless. PDFs can vary in both mean and variance across for a rewardless flower when a new rewarding flower becomes
plant communities, resulting in a wide variety of curve available and the colour of this new flower resembles the
shapes, heights and degrees of overlap among PDFs.
