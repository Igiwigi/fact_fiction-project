of nickel, the amount of magnetic iron will increase rapidly at first as
the temperature falls below 600° C., and then more gradually. The final portions of
the alloy will become magnetic very slowly, and the return to the magnetic state of
all the iron in the alloy will not be complete until the temperature is below the
ordinary temperature of the air. This accounts for the fact, carefully examined in the
first experiments with the meteoric iron (1st winding) and corroborated subsequently,
that the permeability during cooling, eg., at 550°C., is considerably below that shown
at the same temperature during reheating from 15°C. The fact is less obvious in
