264 MR. CHARLES 8. TOMES ON THE

Of the dentine-germs or papille there is little to be aid ; they have a well-marked
odontoblast layer, especially in the eel, and their bases contribute nothing to the for-
mation of a special capsule. In fact the tooth-germs are only bounded by advyentitious
capsules, due to the condensation of the loose connective tissue around them. The
enamel-organs long retain a connexion with the oral epithelium, which, however,
becomes lost after a time, as by the elongation of the tooth its 8ummit 800n passes upwards
into the substance of the oral epithelium ; the © neck of the enamel-organ ” is seen at þ in
figs. 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
