It is not to be questioned that Patella rulgata has considerable power of
locomotion. I haye taken one from the side of a recently stranded wreck,
some feet above the beach ; but it is certain that it often remains for life on
the same spot. Large specimens are always to be found adhering to an irre-
gular and naked rock, with their shells distorted in exact correspondence with
all its inequalities. In such situations they necessarily depend for their food
upon the fragments floating in the water ; and on the rocky shores where they
are found they will derive an abundant supply from this source. The little
eddy which plays around them from the motion of the tides and waves, will,
when the hell is raised from the rock, bring any floating fragments within
reach of the lips.

Patella gorges its food entire. This fact might have been inferred from its
anatomy, and it is proved by obseryation. Some time since, Mr. DiLiwyx and
myself, dissecting some specimens, found in the stomach of one of them a por-
tion of a fucus s0 large, that he was enabled at once to recognise it as F. pin-
natifidus; and in a recent communication he informs me that he has found
fragments of Ulva linza in the stomachs of others. It is not however to be
supposed that Patella never feeds upon growing marine plants : indeed I have
Seen it in the act of preying upon the soft dark substance $0 often found covyer-
ing the shell of Trochus umbilicatus.

The jaws of Patella are furnished with a skeleton far less simple than that
of Trochus. A pair of triangular cartilages, which I shall call the © lateral
jaws,” are united by a ligament along their base to the point, and each has a
