the calculated gravity signal from the pendulum deflection, the pendulum cavity frequency shift
was found to differ from the amount expected by (—0.30 + 0.02) MHz (out of a 62 MHz gravity
signal). This corresponds to a tilt sensitivity of (—6.3 + 0.4) x 10-§ MHzg~! cmt.

As an additional test, a 12kg lead brick was placed on one end of the source mass support
plate, just beyond one end of the interferometer and 43cm from the support plate centre. The
brick was then moved to a symmetrical position at the opposite end of the support plate. Since
the gravity of the brick works symmetrically on the pendulum bobs, no change in the cavity
length should be observed in the absence of tilt. This process was repeated several times, and
the cavity length was observed to change by (0.066 + 0.015) MHz. This gives a tilt sensitivity of
(—6.4 + 1.5) x 10-§ MHz g~! cm™!, in good agreement with the two-mass experiment value.

Using the tilt sensitivity from the two-mass experiment, the fact that the total gravity signal
is 125.4MHz, and the moments based on the source mass position shift, we find a fractional
correction to our gravity signal of (—0.42 + 0.13) x 10-5 for the 12-14 May 2004 data and a
fractional correction of (—0.36 + 0.11) x 10-5 for the 3-6 June 2004 data.

Tl. Temperature effects

The pressure drop experienced by the air feeding the source mass air bearings raises the concern
that resulting cooling could somehow influence the results, either through its effect on the
damping magnets or through some other unknown mechanism. A groove around the outer edge
of the pucks was connected to vacuum in order to remove the feed air before it escaped the pucks.
The temperature of the source masses and support plate was measured and found to be equal to
the chamber temperature to +0.1°C. The air was fed from a house air supply at 40-60 psi and
