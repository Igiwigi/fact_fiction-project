Approximate Theory of the Experiments.

The exact theory of these experiments is rendered still more difficult by the fact that
the water-jet has a different radius at different places. But to obtain at least an
approximate s0lution of the problem we will assume a cylindrical form of the jet. In
accordance with our smoke-experiments, we assume further that all particles of air flow
through the aspirating tube in straight lines parallel to the tube's axis, which we take
for the axis of xy. The velocity of the air-particles has therefore a finite value u only
for this axis, it being zero for any direction perpendicular to this axis.

In consequence of the last statement the pressure must be constant in each section
of the aspirating tube. Now we have seen by the manometer that the pressure at the
beginning of the tube is the same as at the end, viz. the pressure of the atmosphere ;
this leads us to suppose that the pressure does not vary at all in the whole length of
the tube.
