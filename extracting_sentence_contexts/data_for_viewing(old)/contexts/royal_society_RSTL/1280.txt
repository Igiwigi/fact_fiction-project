lect some of it for chemical examination, but it was too small
in quantity (not equalling in volume + of the volume of the
cavity,) to be submitted to analysis. It swam on the water, had

no distinct taste, but a smell resembling naphtha ; a portion
of it taken out mixed with the water, when exposed to heat
acted like fixed oil, and it seemed to have a high temper-
ature of ebullition. It inflamed, producing a white smoke.

The fact, of almost a perfect vacuum existing in a cavity
containing an expansible but difficultly volatile substance, may
be considered as highly favourable to the theory of the
igneous origin of crystals: the other experiment is of a nature
entirely different, though its result may be explained in the
same'Supposition.

In examining a crystal in the collection of the Royal Insti-
tution, and which from its characters I believe to be from
Capas d'Olanda, Province of Minas Geraes, Brazil, I observed
that the quantity of aeriform matter was unusually small in
proportion to the quantity of fluid, in two or three cavities
not occupying +5 0r -; of the space; and from the peculiarity
