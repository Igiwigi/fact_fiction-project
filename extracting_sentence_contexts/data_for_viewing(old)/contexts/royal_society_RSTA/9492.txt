quantity on the average stands to the latter approximately in the ratio 7: 8.

In Table XXXVII., April is the only month in which R from all the months
combined is the same as the arithmetic mean of the values for the individual months,
but the differences in the other months are small, just as in the case of H. The
differences in Table XXXVII. between the inequality range for the year and the
arithmetic mean of the ranges for the twelve months are a good deal smaller than in
the case of H, The average excess of the arithmetic means is only about 34 per cent.
This implies, of course, less variability in the hours of maximum and minimum.

Comparing Tables XXX VIII. and XXXIX. with Tables XXXVI. and XXXVII. we
see that the excess of R’ over R is usually large. Allowance must, of course, be made
for the fact that the more highly disturbed days—242 for H and 348 for V—
