None the less,
itis probable that even after isolation of P,, the edge of the second primordium extended
laterally a little beyond its normal position. After isolation of I, in 14 out of 19 apices that were examined, the stipule of the
second primordium which extended across the region above the wound, was seen to be
larger than the other, so that the primordium as a whole was asymmetrical, as can be
seen from Table II. This fact indicates that the stipules of a primordium can to some
extent spread out into a space that is available for them, independently of the central
part of the primordium, from which the rest of the leaf originates. After isolation of P,
the stipules of the second primordium did not extend nearly so far into the region above
the wound, and only in one experiment out of 20 was this primordium slightly
asymmetrical. (9) The Shapes of the Primordia and their Representation.
