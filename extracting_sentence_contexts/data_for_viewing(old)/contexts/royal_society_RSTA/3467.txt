observations, we observers naturally try to point our fingers at the theorists. In this case, we
were suspicious that the problem may lay with the interpretation of the observations: how were
spectral types (or colours) converted to effective temperatures? A new generation of the MARCS
stellar atmosphere models that included sphericity, improved opacities and low surface gravities
were used by Levesque et al. [18] to determine reddenings and effective temperatures for a large
sample of Galactic RSGs whose distances were known. When the improved parameters were
used to compare to the evolutionary tracks, there was a substantial improvement (!), as shown in
figure 2. This model fitting relies upon fitting the TiO bands in the spectrum, the same lines used
for the spectral types. These lines become stronger with decreasing effective temperatures, as the
spectral types becomes later.
RSGs cluster along a vertical line (as shown in figure 2) known as the Hayashi limit [20]. Cooler
than that, a star will no longer be in hydrostatic equilibrium. The location of the Hayashi limit
shifts to warmer temperatures as the metallicity decreases, and this is consistent with the fact that
the average spectral type shifts to earlier types in lower metallicity systems, as first explained by
Elias et al. [21]. Recently, the effective temperature scale of [18] and subsequent work [22] has been
called into question by Davies et al. [23]. Their results suggest that all RSGs have essentially the
same temperature regardless of spectral type. It is not clear how readily this can be reconciled
with the shifting of the Hayashi limit as a function of metallicity (e.g. [22]).
The lifetimes of RSGs are much longer than that of YSGs, as basically the entire He-burning
phase of stars 10-30Mo are spent as RSGs. There are around 500 RSGs known in M31 [15,16]
and the LMC [11,24], and about 150 known in NGC 6822 [25], the SMC [24] and M33 [13]. About
a dozen are known in WLM [25]. Work is in progress by the present authors to identify and
characterize these stars in Sextans A and B.
