particular challenge for modal identification and reflects the degree of axial symmetry and the
minor effect of mass and stiffness distribution variation, e.g. due to the landing. In terms of wave
loading, it is unlikely that the weak mode directionality is a factor, but it is more relevant for
validating the finite element model. In addition to the two pairs of modes, there are additional
modes not clear in the FRFs that are suspected to involve little other than motion of the helideck.

(d) Effect of helideck on modal properties

The more important features of the two pairs of modes which involve both helideck structure
and masonry tower are that all four modes are zero-noded in the tower, i.e. they resemble the first
mode shape of a cantilever. Figure 7 shows that for the lower pair, the helipad modal ordinate
is in phase with the tower, while for the higher pair, the helipad ordinate is out of phase. The
relative magnitude of the helipad /tower ordinates is close to 20 for the first pair, which is in fact
