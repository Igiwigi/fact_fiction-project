was incorporated through space curvature keeping Newton’s Law intact), enlargement should
be such that vacuum energy is included without disturbing GR. Could it be that it gravitates via
higher dimensions leaving GR intact in four dimensions? These are some of the possible directions
that should be probed for framework enlargement leading to a new theory, possibly of quantum
gravity.

3In a recent preprint [11], it has also been argued that ‘dark energy’ is not vacuum energy.


Next we wish to raise the most fundamental question, what is meant by expansion of the
Universe physically? What is it that is expanding and how? Since space-time is all-inclusive, it
has to expand on its own which means it is being created anew at each epoch as it expands [14].
The Universe or space-time was not only created in the beginning in the Big Bang, but is in fact
being created continuously at each instant and everywhere. This reminds one of the steady state
theory [15] of continual creation of matter out of nothing. There is however one critical difference.
In the steady-state theory, the continual creation was postulated to get rid of the Big Bang birth of
the Universe. That was the cause of its ultimate fall after the discovery of the cosmic microwave
background radiation establishing the Big Bang birth of the Universe. In our conception, the
continual creation of the new microstructure of space-time is sourced by the Big Bang. This is
because continual creation is the realization of the physical process of expansion of the Universe
which is supposed to be powered by the Big Bang.

In this discourse, we have articulated two motivations for the quantum theory of space-time
and gravity, one, gravitational interaction of vacuum energy and the other expansion of the
