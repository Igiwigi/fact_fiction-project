We may always predict the attractive force, a unit of
force at a unit of distance being given, on the supposition that it is as the opposed
areas directly, and as the squares of the distances inversely; the electricity accumu-
lated in the opposed points being as the square roots of the respective distances* (32.). This general result is not vitiated by any oblique action which may appear to arise
in consequence of change in the position of the opposed surfaces. Thus if the two
opposed plane areas, d, f, fig. 20, be any how placed, provided they maintain their re-
lative position with respect to each other, it is evident no difference can possibly arise ;
it would be in fact merely placing a coated pane in different angular positions. If
we $uppose one of the plates brought into the position @ b, fig. 21, 80 as to be oblique
to the other, still the same general principle applies : we may conceive the interval of
air, an m b, to be a s0lid dielectric of unequal thickness, the coatings of which are
the opposed areas @ b, m n; the attractive force, therefore, between the plates, @ b,
a' V', would become diminished by the exposure of the unopposed portions, n a, m Þ,
and by the general increase of distance. If the plates were 80 opposed as to cause a
portion of one to project beyond the other, as in fig. 22, then the force would be re-
duced to the opposed portions, a m, 2 d, and would be diminished by the external
unopposed parts n c, m b.
