STRUCTURE assumes that each of the
lineages constitute the incipient species. Initial analysis isolates is unrelated in the sense that they have acquired
of data using both a neighbour-joining tree of â€” their genomes independently from a number of distinct
concatenated sequences and the program STRUCTURE, ancestral sources. In fact, the four Typhi STs in the
using naive clustering, suggested three different popu- sample are closely related to each other by recent
lations, putatively corresponding to partially reproduc- common descent. This clonal relatedness, plus the
tively isolated gene pools. The first of these consists of a outlier sequence, which includes many fixed differences
single lineage, containing the human pathogen Typhi, between Typhi and the other strains, causes STRUCTURE
whose strains all share a recent common ancestor to infer that Typhi represents a distinct, recombining
(Kidgell et al. 2002).
