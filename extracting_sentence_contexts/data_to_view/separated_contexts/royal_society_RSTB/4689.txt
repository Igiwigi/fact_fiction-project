There is the same zonary arrangement and a comparable great complexity in the
arrangement of the allantoic villi, but in Hyrax there is no syncytial layer of maternal
tissue such as is said to surround the villi in the elephant. Were the placentation of
Elephas better known, however, it is possible that resemblances might be found, but as
far as our knowledge extends at present, it is not possible to make any definite statement. In fact, the placenta of Hyrax, whilst conforming to the hemo-chorial type typical of
the Rodentia, Insectivora, etc., is of so unusual a type, and presents such unique
features of its own, that all one is justified in saying is that our present knowledge of
the placentation of Hyrax rather tends to emphasise the isolated position which the
order occupies in the series of the Eutheria. GLOSSARY.
