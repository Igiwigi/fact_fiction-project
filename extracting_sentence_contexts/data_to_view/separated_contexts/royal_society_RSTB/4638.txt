AND THE CAUSE OF THEIR IRIDESCENT COLOURS. 55

experiment was tried, it was found that quite moderate pressures caused the green
colour to disappear and to be replaced by a dull yellow bronze. However, if the wing
was kept moist, the colour instantly and completely returned on removing the
pressure. The fact that water is specific in its action, and that no other fluid will serve
the same purpose, suggests that there is a film which, like gelatin, can only absorb
water. Acids also appear to restore the green colour, rendering it fairly permanent,
presumably because they are more easily absorbed. If this is the true explanation, it
is perhaps curious that there should be no traces of this membrane in cross-sections.
