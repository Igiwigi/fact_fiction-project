through their nerves, while the heart is only now and then
influenced through its nerves, its usual stimulus being as im-
mediately applied to it, as the salt was to the muscles of the
limb in the above experiment, and acting as independently of
the nervous system. We do not surely in all this see any
difference in the nature of the muscular power of the heart,
and that of the muscles of voluntary motion, except their
being fitted to obey different stimuli, a difference which we
find in the two sides of the heart itself.

It may here be objected, that in apoplexy the power of the
muscles of voluntary motion is lost, while that of the heart is
little or not at all impaired. Were such the fact, this objec-
tion would be unanswerable; but I have repeatedly examined
the: state of the -muscles of voluntary motion in apoplexy,

mulus which excites them, that is lost in apoplexy. In this
disease, the heart continues to contract; because its stimulus is
