From
the photon number of the states versus pump power, shown in figure 5 as well as the full photon-
number distribution presented in [18], we believe that the spectral properties do not change at
least up to mean photon numbers of 20, corresponding to 19 dB of squeezing. The time-ordering
effect should show a deviation from the curve in figure 5, which does not happen. This might be
explained by the fact that we use a broad spectral filter with a width very close to the generated
spectrum: since time-ordering predicts a spectral broadening of the down-conversion modes, a
spectral filter might suppress this effect. Nevertheless, even below this regime of up to 20 photons
we expect very strong squeezing producible from the waveguide. In the implementation of [18],
the squeezing would be limited by the total losses of around 35%, as other limiting factors such
as noise can already be excluded from the clean photon-number distribution.
