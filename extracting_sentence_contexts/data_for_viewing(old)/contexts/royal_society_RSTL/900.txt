roots, independently of any previous knowledge of R. For this
purpose, we might assumeR =0;7, 7, &c. = 1 or, 1 &c. and
adopt, as most suitable to these conditions, the algorithm of
Theorem 1I, until we had arrived at R*, an unambiguous
limiting value of z. But since these initiatory researches

seem more naturally to depend on the simple derivees, a, b, &c.
than on A, B, &c. their aggregates ; and since, in fact, as long
as 7is assumptive orindependent of R, our system of derivation
offers no peculiar advantage ; I should prefer applying the
limiting formule in the usual way ; passing however from
column to column (Woop, F 318.) of the results, at first by
means of the neat algorithm suggested in the note on Art. 7,
and afterwards by differencing, &c, as recommended by La-
GRANGE, (Res. des Eq. Num. $ 13g), when the number of co-
lumns has exceeded the dimensions of the equation. (Vide
Addendum.)
