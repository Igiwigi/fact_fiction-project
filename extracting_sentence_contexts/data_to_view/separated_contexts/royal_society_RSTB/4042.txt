A second great argument in favour of this contention is that the species common
to Ceylon and Southern India, 7.e., species which must, on the whole, have been
developed before the separation of those two countries, and which must therefore,
on the whole, be older than those endemic to Ceylon only, are more common than
the latter. If we imagine that they were all developed in Ceylon, and spread
subsequently to South India—a purely gratuitous assumption—we might then
say that they had been developed to suit the Ceylon conditions, and, being older, had
had more time to spread, and thus become commoner. But, unfortunately for this
hypothesis, these very species are still much less common than the species of wide
distribution, and this fact is very difficult to explain on any theory of adaptation. If they have been able to spread over Ceylon and Peninsular India, they have had
ample time to become common in Ceylon (7.¢., as common as the species of wide
distribution) if they were specially suited to the local conditions. This leads on to another argument.
