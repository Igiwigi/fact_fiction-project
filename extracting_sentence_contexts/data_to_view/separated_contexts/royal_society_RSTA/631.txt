The dual forms reduce in
exactly the same way. 13. Itis now a simple matter to show that the remaining forms of the system A, of grade
eight or more, are reducible (and in fact admit an invariant reduction). For any such form
may be obtained by substituting appropriate symbols or combinations of symbols for â‚¬ and
7 in the form on the left of (12-1), and hence all such forms are = 0. The enumeration of the
irreducible forms belonging to the system A is accordingly complete.
