reticular tissue similar to the superficial layer of the body-wall explants with sometimes
a little skeletal muscle.

In both the experimental and control cultures some of the carbon particles were
embedded in the ectoderm, whilst others had sunk into the underlying tissue.

The above results showed clearly that in the ventral body wall there is a general
movement of tissue in a median direction.

This was demonstrated by the paired carbon marks which moved towards the
mid-line in the explants of the ventral body wall but towards the periphery in the
control cultures. That this movement also involved the ectoderm and superficial
connective tissue was shown by the fact that all the marks in the ventral body-wall
cultures moved inwards even when they were embedded in the skin and adjacent
tissue, and not only those incorporated in the sheet of flattened cells. Whether the
superficial tissue moved inwards of its own accord or was carried along by the under-
lying sheet of flattened cells is uncertain. Probably, however, the latter is true, because
at the periphery, where it was not under the influence of the layer of flattened cells,
the superficial tissue spread outwards over the medium like an ordinary tissue culture,
so that it finally extended far beyond the outer margins of the inward-moving sheet
of flattened cells.

Although the tissue moved in a median direction in the explanted ventral body wall,
the movement was usually neither so rapid nor so extensive as in normal development.
Thus the ventral edges of the sternal plates, represented in the cultures by two rods of
