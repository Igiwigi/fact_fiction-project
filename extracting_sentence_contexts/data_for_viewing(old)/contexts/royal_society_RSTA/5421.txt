of chaos—i.e. the strong sensitivity to rather small perturbations and to
slight changes in the initial conditions—may even add a certain degree of
unpredictability and randomness to the dynamics.

From the above observations, it is natural to regard life from the perspective
of complex systems. Indeed, how could one guess what a superior organism can
do and accomplish based only on the study of its basic units, the cells? How
to infer the huge potential transformations in a planet, including entire biome
reshaping, just from an increase in the concentration of a single gas, carbon
dioxide COs, in its atmosphere? How to distinguish the exact individual aspects
defining human ‘culture’? On the one hand, the study of life processes at diverse
scales encompasses the broad spectrum of fields mentioned above. On the other
hand, owing to the fact that life can only, in a very rough approximation, be
studied at a single level, a deeper understanding of its entangled aspects may
require approaches contrasting with the usual reductionism of science. Moreover,
by its multi-disciplinary nature, it most probably needs to be addressed by
researchers of different fields working in close interaction. Then, life, still one
of the great challenges to science, may find proper answers from the point of view
of complexity science.

2. The scales of life

Given a sort of hierarchical or multi-level organization of complex systems,
they behave differently at different (spatial, temporal, energetic, etc.) scales of
observation. Moreover, scales are intertwined such that the dynamics taking place
