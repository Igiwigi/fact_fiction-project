Importantly, Agonist binding (Ach, ATP) to G-protein-coupled receptors acti-
the breakdown of FAEE to fatty acids (FA) by intracellular vate phospholipase C 8 (PLC§) in pancreatic acinar and ductal
hydrolases significantly contribute to the toxic effects of cells. The activated PLC releases inositol trisphosphate (IP3) by
non-oxidative ethanol metabolites [30]. This fact has been hydrolysing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP) [37].
further emphasized in a recent elegant study by Huang et al. Under physiological conditions, the intracellular Ca?* signals
[31]. They showed that the inhibition of oxidative ethanol have a strict spatio-temporal localization [38,39], mostly limiting
metabolism significantly enhance, whereas inhibition of non- Ca’* signals to the apical pole of the cells.
