Above the tangent plane and for distances
within about 100 km., where the first term of the diffraction formula no longer pre-
dominates, the curves have been calculated by the simple theory of a direct ray and
a reflected ray, using the reciprocal theorem, and taking into account the imperfect
reflexion and the curvature of the earth. The diffraction curves are then joined up to
these by eye, and the uncertainty in this region can only be one or two decibels. The straight line portions of the curves show where the first term of the diffraction
theory is predominant, and the fact that they are all parallel shows that the height-
gain relation is independent of the distance from the transmitter. A complete set of
curves for A = 2 to 10 m. for land and sea has been published elsewhere (Eckersley 1937).
