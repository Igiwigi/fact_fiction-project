vary in their action : (@) according to the acid radical with which they are combined ;
and (b) according to the number of the atoms of hydrogen which have been replaced

Sin the ammonia by an alcohol radical. The influence of the acid, however, appears to
us to be less marked than in the case of ammonia itself.
E "The iodides appear to have the strongest paralyzing action, both on the central
ervous system and on the peripheral nerves. Next to them come the chlorides, and
=he sulphates have the least action.
S The paralysis of the higher reflex, e.q., of the cornea, was more marked in Frogs
AFhan in Mammals. In the latter, indeed, corneal reflex was observed almost at the last.
Z We have only examined the action of the iodides of tetramethyl- and tetraethyl-
Summonium, 8 that we cannot compare their actions with those of the corresponding
chlorides and sulpbates. We have already drawn attention to the fact that their
Fotion appears to differ very greatly from the compound ammonias in which only
Sthree atoms of hydrogen have been replaced by an alcohol radical. In the tetra
Seompounds conyulsant action is .very strongly marked, while in the triad compound
Zammonias ib is much less 80, or may be altogether absent.
FH In the case of warm-blooded animals salivation was noticed before death in
Epoisoning by trimethyl-ammonium suIphate, tetramethyl-ammonium iodide, and tetra
Zethyl-ammonium iodide ; it also occurred, to some extent, in amyl-ammonium iodide.
ETn one or two others a similar action was observed to a less extent.
Y We have not investigated fully the action on the spinal cord and higher nerve
Scentres of these different compounds, because the number of s8ubstances on which we
= have experimented was 80 great that we thought it better to leave this subject for a
a subsequent research, and to confine ourselves more especially to their action on musecle
