Thus the cuticle of the lower surface of the leaf is always found to
A ‘be more permeable than that of the upper.

* Wiusnex reasonably suggests that this so-called cuticle is really, in most cases, epidermis.

The lower “cuticle” thus never exceeds the upper in permeability by more th
five times, in spite of the fact that the lower is usually riddled with stomata covered
only with a film of glycerine jelly, while there are but few of these weak spots on th
upper cuticle. This shows that the actual permeability of the cuticle of the lower
surface, apart from the stomata, is never as great as five times that of the uppe
cuticle. I hope to make use of this later.
