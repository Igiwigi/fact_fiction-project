Methane was almost the last gas that I investigated, and it was in consequence of
its appearing to full away from the law, that exceptional trouble was taken to secure
that it should be pure. All who have worked with this gas know how difficult it is
to prepare it free from hydrogen, and the presence of hydrogen would raise the value
of y; but the precaution taken of passing the gas over palladium, the concordance of _
the results for methane prepared by the two different methods, and the evidence of
the analysis show that there could not be anything approaching enough hydrogen
present to account for the difference. Nor can we account for the difference by sup-
posing the results for the three methyl compounds to be too low, for, apart from the
fact that there are three of them, and that their values for y agree fairly well with
each other, the most likely error in their case is that due to the presence of air and
moisture, which would make the results too high. Hence we must conclude that
methane has not the same y as its three substitution products. It is strange that it should break through a law that appears to hold for all the
other gases, but the circumstance is not without parallel.
