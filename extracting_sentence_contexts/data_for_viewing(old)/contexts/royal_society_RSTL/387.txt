Suggestions concerning the state in which acids may previously
have existed in vegetables.

I have sometimes indulged in the supposition, that the vege-
table acids are not primarily formed by the immediate union
of their elements, but that they may have previously existed
in a definite combination, called the bitter principle. It is
possible that this principle may be a compound basis, which
by uniting to oxygen, or by undergoing more complicated
processes, might change its nature so far as to become an
acid. The whole is a mere conjecture, and perhaps desery-
ing of little consideration ; the facts, however, which sug-
gested it may be noticed.

The sweetness of any vegetable juice, has been generally
attributed to a sweet principle called sugar. In the same
manner it has been lately supposed, that bitterness depends
on a bitter principle, which, although variously disguised,
is always identical, Dr. Tyomson has shown, that when
