maceration. My own experiments prove the same fact, yet it is not impossible that the
minute quantities of iodine, phosphorus, and sulphur present in sponge may modify the
s0lubility of the fibre.

* Under the supposition that a resinous gum might act as a protection, portions of
sponge were boiled in benzol, ether, and alcohol, but these solvents did not modify the
characters in any noticeable degree.
