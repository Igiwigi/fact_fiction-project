If this is true, music could be a
fossil of that hypothetical early stage of vocal communication
among hominins, often referred to as musical protolanguage
(e.g. [142,143]) or music-like protolanguage (e.g. [6]). This


idea of a shared common ancestor between music and strikingly similar to those of music [154]). In fact, even the | 6 |

language is probably the most recurrent idea in evolutionary perceptual phenomena in (at least some) non-human animals
