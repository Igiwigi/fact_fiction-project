The height of the
latter above the valley is variable; and though generally limited to one main platform,
it is not always on the same level, and there are cases of minor intermediate terraces
between the extreme levels. The heights are of course relative one to the other, and
not directly to the sea-level. Valley of the Waveney.â€”The levels recorded in my former paper establish the fact
that the flint-implement-bearing deposit of Hoxne is at a height of 40 feet above the
Gold Stream, and 50 feet above the Waveney, of which the Gold Stream is a tributary. Mr. Evaxs and I found a very similar deposit, also overlying the Boulder Clay, at Athe-
lington, a few miles higher up the valley of the former stream. In following the course
of the Waveney, from above Diss to the sea at Lowestoft, terraces of gravel are found at
distant intervals on the adjacent hills.
