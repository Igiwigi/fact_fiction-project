(ii) We have that A,(M) = 0, where for t = x + iy,
Ags —y"((0°/9x7) + (07/ay?)) + iky((8/Ax) + i(8/Ay)).
(iii) There exists a polynomial Py(t) € C[e~?7!"] such that
M(t) — Pu(t)=O(e"),

where t = x + iy, as y > 00 for some € > 0. Analogous conditions hold at all cusps.

The group J(N) in the above definition is the set of all 2 x 2 matrices with integer entries and
determinant 1, with lower left entry congruent to 0 (mod N). The operator A, in condition (ii)
above is called the weight-k Laplacian operator. The complex numbers ¢q appearing in condition (i)
are defined to be 1 or i depending on whether d is 1 or —1 (mod 4).

It is a fact that harmonic Maass forms M decompose as M = M* + M~,asum of a holomorphic
part M+ and a non-holomorphic part M~, where M+ and M~ have prescribed shapes (see [3,
Definition 4.4] for specific details). We refer to such holomorphic parts as mock modular forms
[7], aptly named, since Ramanujan’s mock theta functions are among the first explicit examples
(up to possible multiplication by rational powers of q and/or the addition of constants, see [3,
Theorem 9.4]). The theory of harmonic Maass forms has developed in many analogous ways
to the theories of ordinary modular and Maass forms, though it has also led to numerous new
applications (see, for example [3] and the many references therein).

(b) Quantum modular forms

Understanding Ramanujan’s mock theta functions within the context of harmonic Maass forms
has opened many doors in recent years. However, questions remained, as B.C. Berndt (author
