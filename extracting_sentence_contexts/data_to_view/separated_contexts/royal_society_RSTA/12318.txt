Suppose that there is a fictitious satellite whose R. A. is equal to the Moon’s
longitude, and let 2, h® be the R. A. of the fictitious moon and of the mean sun at
2 noon of the day under consideration, and let 7 be the mean solar time of the fictitious
5 moon’s transit.

8 Then at transit
in t+h—l=gqr,

3 where g is even for upper and odd for lower transit. The rate of change of ¢ + / is y, and if/ be the rate of change of /, 7 is given by

oe ae
Then at time 7+ 7
i A= 2t+ 2h — 21 — ky

= 297 + 2(y —1) T— ke,
and

4a = gr + (y— i) T— hw

Now A occurs in the arguments of all the semi-diurnal tides, $A in those of the
diurnal, and 2A in those of the quater-diurnal. Hence we may omit the 2qz in the expression for A, and write

provided that when q is odd we change the signs of the diurnal terms.
