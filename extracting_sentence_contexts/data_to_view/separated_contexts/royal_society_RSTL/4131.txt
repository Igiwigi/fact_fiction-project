To apply what we have now learned of the nature of the objects contained in
matter taken from the pancreatic duct to the elucidation of our subject. It is
scarcely necessary, in the first place, to say that the fragments of columnar epithe-
lium found in the matter from the hepatic ducts have been, like the columnar epi-
thelium contained in the matter from the pancreatic duct, detached from the walls
of the ducts themnselves, Of the free nuclei, the round ones* are identical with those
of the cells of hepatic parenchyma, and are, together with the granulous substance,
globules of oil and fragments of cell-walls, evidently snch as might be supposed to be
the remains of broken-up hepatic cells and their contents in process of resolution into
bile,â€”as evidently as the free nuclei and grannlous substance found in the matter of
the pancreatic duct are the debris of the endogenous corpuscles of the vesicles of the
pancreas broken up and in process of resolution into pancreatic juice. The fact of
the existence of hepatic cells in the smaller hepatic ducts above enunciated, suffi- ciently accounts for the presence of their broken-up remains in the ducts. 7.
