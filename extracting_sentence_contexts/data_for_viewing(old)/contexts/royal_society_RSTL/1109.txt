This account of Mr. Beri'‚Äùs, which differs s0 materially from
that of the female organs of the kanguroo, corresponds ex-
actly with that of the American opossum, only the parts are
upon a larger scale; and it is found that the male organs
of the wombat and Kkoala are also gimilar to those of the


310 Mr. How's Account of the

American opossum. These animals, therefore, form the in-
termediate link between the opossum and kanguroo.

These facts throw considerable light upon the mode of pro-
pagation of this very curious tribe of animals; and they confirm
in the most satisfactory manner, the observyations contained in
a former paper upon the kanguroo, taken from a specimen
which was sent to England preserved in spirits, and which was
in an impregnated state, but the parts rendered very indistinct
by being coagulated and long kept. In that instance the embryo
was evidently surrounded by a coagulated jelly, and there
was no connection between the foetus and the coats of the
uterus. Further evidence was however required upon s0 new
and interesting a subject ; this is now obtained by Mr. BeLL's
examination of the impregnated uteri of an animal whose
mode of generation is the same, made immediately after death.
