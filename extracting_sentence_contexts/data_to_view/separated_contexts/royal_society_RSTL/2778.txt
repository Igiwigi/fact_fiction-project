PHILIP ON DIGESTION.

animal survives the operation eighteen, twenty, or more hours, undigested food
alone is found in it. The cause of 80 long a time being required wholly to
expel the food, which has undergone any degree of the digestive process,
appears to be, that as digested food alone excites that action of the stomach
which propels it into the intestine, and the more perfectly it is digested, it
excites this action the more readily, the last part of the digested food which
has but imperfectly undergone the digestive process is expelled very slowly, 80
that it is very long before food wholly undigested alone is left. That the longer the animal lives after the excision of part of the eighth pair
of nerves, the less digested food is left in the stomach, is a fact now admitted
by all who assisted at the experiments. Among the great number who have
witnessed and been satisfied with their result, are Sir Humpary Davy, Mr.
Tromas Anprew KNiGnr, and Mr. Bropis, gentlemen whose experimental
accuracy, in the opinion of the public, has never been surpassed. Of this fact, the gentlemen to whose paper I have referred, are not aware.
