numerous meshes, in which are deposited the gray nucleated vesicles, which are scen
to be formed as early as the eighth day. On the twenty-first day this lamina presents
the same structure as is found in the full-grown bird. The preceding observations can,
I think, be applied in explanation of some lately disputed points in connection with
the anatomy and physiology of the retina and optic nerye. And first of the retina.

This membrane has been seen to arise as a protrusion from the cells forming the
future brain. Now in the microscopic anatomy of this membrane, as described by
Bowman, the vesicular layer of the retina is stated to be analogous to the vesicular
layer of the hemisphere of the brain, whilst HenLs, and other anatomists of great
note, consider the elements of this layer to be more analogous to epithelium. From
the circumstance of the retina arising, as it undoubtedly does, from the cerebral cells,
being in fact part of them and performing a similar function, we have, I think, a great
proof of the similarity in the structure of these two parts. There is another point
also, I think, of some importance in proving, as it does, that the opinion of some
modern anatomists is incorrect in stating that none of the fibres of the optic nerve
can be traced to the optic thalamus. I have said that the origin of the retina is from
the anterior cerebral cell, and that at a future period the optic nerve could be traced
uniting with its fellow of the opposite side beneath the optic lobes. It is in the
anterior cerebral cell that the thalami are subsequently formed, which makes it ex-
ceedingly probable that some of its fibres are connected with it, although the greater
majority may be traced to the optic lobes.

These facts I think are of some importance, and prove how deductions formed
from microscopic embryology may be applied to confirm dissections or microscopic
