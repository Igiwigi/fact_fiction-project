E. Again, eight consecutive crops of #urnips (four © White Globe” and four © Swedish”)

Agave an average annual yield, per acre, of about 40 1bs. of Nitrogen, without the snpply

Any kind, yielded, after a few years, only a few hundred-weights of produce per acre;

B but the percentage of Nitrogen in these diminutive unmanured turnips was very un-

A more than that in the unmanured Cereal grain-crops. And, in connexion with this
