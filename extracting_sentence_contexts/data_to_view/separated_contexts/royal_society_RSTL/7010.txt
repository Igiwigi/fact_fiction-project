Hence we alſo
ſee, that a machine, which would project a harpoon
thirty yards with ſufficient force and proper direc-
tion, mult give a chance for giving thirty whales for
one in the common way. Several machines haye been propoſed to anſwer”
this end, but have all prov'd abortive, The croſs-
bow was try'd, but was too weak, and ſubject to
break with the froſt in thoſe cold climates. Gunpowder was next applied, I am told with ns
better tucceſs ; for, beſides the difficulty of applying
it to throw thoſe heavy bodies in the form of darts,
eſpecially ſuch, as muſt carry a rope along with them,
it frightens all the whales from the place, where it
is fired, either by the light, or by the exploſion,
which it produces ; perhaps, both ways ; but I ima-
gine, more by the ſound than the light ; for, in the
ſummer-time, there is in thoſe parts a continual day
for ſeveral months, fo that a flaſh would not be re-
markable, I know it is doubted by the beſt phyſio-
logiſts, that fiſhes can hear, or that water, being in-
compreſſible, can propagate ſonorous undulations be-
low the ſurface, Notwithſtanding the ſeveral inge-
nious experiments, that prove water incompreſſible,
yet there are ſeveral facts, that ſeem to contradict

that condluſion ; ſuch as the reflexion of hard bodies,
which impingeobliquelyon the ſurface of water ; which
ſhews, that water is elaſtic, and therefore compreſ-
fible. | It will be objected, that the parts of the hard
bodies are compreſſed, not thoſe of the water : but I ,
ſuſpect, if the ſame means be uſed to compreſs a
cryſtal ball, a piece of diamond, or hard ſteel, we
{hall have the fame reaſon to conclude them incom-
preſſible alſo ; tho! I am ſure, that they will all rebound
from water, if they impinge at any angle under fif=
- teen degrees.
