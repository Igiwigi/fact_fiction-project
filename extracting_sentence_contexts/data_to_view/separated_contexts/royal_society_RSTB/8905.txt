Mos-
quito larval development, for example, takes place at
timescales varying from days to weeks [171,172], whereas
human health interventions such as vaccination programmes
may vary from days to weeks to months [173,174]. Modelling
efforts must therefore include methods by which to couple
the timescales of these processes in biologically relevant
ways that capture the dynamics, but without creating artifi-
cial restrictions or producing erroneous model artefacts. Capturing these temporal scales successfully is made more
complicated by the fact that the duration of life stages/
states (excluding disease-specific states) in hosts most often
progress unaltered by vector or pathogen, but disease vectors
have been shown to be susceptible to alteration in their basic
survival, developmental and fecundity rates by the microbes
and pathogens they carry [175,176]. Furthermore, pathogen
states/stages are predominantly driven by their epidemiolo-
gical dynamics within and among hosts and vectors and, in
some cases, progress to a different developmental stage
only upon successful completion of the cycle between vectors
and (sometimes multiple species of) hosts [177]. When broadening the scope of questions asked with these
models from just the current examination of epidemiological
patterns to explore how climate change may alter the behav-
iour of this entire system in the future, yet another timescale
must be incorporated, as the processes of climate change act
on time frames of years to centuries or more.
