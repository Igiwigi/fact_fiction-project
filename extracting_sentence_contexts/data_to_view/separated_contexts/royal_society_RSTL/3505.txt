On dropping on it a s0lution of nitrate of silver,
however, and spreading it over by inclining the plate to and fro, (which it bore with-
out disturbing the film of chloride,) it became highly sensitive, although no organic
matter could have been introduced with the nitrate, which was quite pure, nor could
any indeed have been present, unless it be supposed to have emanated from the
hempen filaments which were barely in contact with the edge of the glass, and which
were constantly abstracting matter from its surface in place of introducing new.

36. Exposed in this state to the focus of a camera, with the glass towards the in-
cident light, it became impressed with a remarkably well-defined negative picture,
which was direct or reversed according as looked at from the front or the back. On
pouring over this, cautiously by means of a pipette, a solution of hyposulphite of
soda, the picture disappeared, but this was only while wet, for on washing in pure
water and drying, it was restored, and assumed much the air of a Daguerrotype
when laid on a black ground, and still more 80 when smoked at the back, the silyered
portions reflecting most light, s0 that its character had, in fact, changed from negative
to positive. From such a picture (of course before smoking) I have found it practi-
cable to take photographic copies; and although I did not, in fact, sueceed in attempt-
ing to thicken the film of silyer, by connecting it, under a weak solution of that metal,
with the reducing pole of a voltaic pile, the attempt afforded distinct indications of
its practicability with patience and perseverance, as here and there, oyer some small
portions of the surface, the lights had assumed a full metallic brilliancy under this pro-
cess. I would only mention further to those who may think this experiment worth
repeating, that all my attempts to secure a good result by drying the nitrate on the
film of chloride have failed, the erystallization of the salt disturbing the uniformity
of the coating.
