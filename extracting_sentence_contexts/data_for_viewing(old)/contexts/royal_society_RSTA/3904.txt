Individual rights, privacy in particular, have a central role in the debate on the ethical
implications of big data and open data [10,59]. However, while it is undeniable that big data
and open data put individual privacy under a sharp devaluating pressure, it is also true that
the problems posed by profiling and the subsequent discrimination do not arise because of such : =
pressure. 38

Consider, for example, the case of online advertisements described in [11]. The study showed
that searching for racial-related names commonly associated with Afro-American population mea)
in two major search engines generated ads suggestive of an arrest in up to 95% of cases. The :
discrimination occurring in this case rests on a form of profiling that does not breach individual a]
privacy. In fact, the names used in the study were not the names of real persons, yet it violates the DNS
right of individuals belonging to the group of the Afro-American population. This follows from [a
the very nature of data analytics and big data, whose goal is the identification of groups. [B

Nonetheless, even if the outcome does not breach individual privacy, it can still pose serious .
risks at the group level, showing that while privacy of individuals may not be breached, the one
of the group certainly is [29,30,60]. For this reason, the right to group privacy is increasingly more
often recognized as a crucial right to be defended in mature information societies.

[This] is a right held by a group as a group rather than by its members severally. It is the
group, not its members, that is correctly identified as the right-holder [...] Open Data
is more likely to treat types (of customers, users, citizens, demographic population, etc.)
rather than tokens (you, Alice, me...), and hence groups rather than individuals. But
