confess that I cannot quite follow this argument. The Thysanocrinus referred to is
Harr's type of that name, which WacusmuTaH and SPRINGER s8ubsequently place
under Dimerocrinus (Paraes); and in their generic diagnosis of it they say,
© Interradial arez composed of but few plates, the first one large, placed between the
second radials, and leaning partly againsb the third, with two small plates above.
Posterior, or anal area wider, the firs plate in line with the first radials, and of the
8ame 8ize.” Thylacocrinus, on the other hand, is said to have © Interradials numerous,
the lower one resting directly on the basals ;” 1.e., all five interradials meet the
basals, and not that on the anal side only. This difference is further recognised by
WacnsmuTH and SPRINGER, for they place the two genera in different sections of
their family Rhodocrinide; and T do not, therefore, see the force of their doubts
respecting the persistency of the characters in this portion of ZraTEL's classification.
In fact, they make great use of the position of the lowest interradials in defining their
8ubdivisions of the family.

According to their general description of the Rhodocrinide, © In most of the genera
the first interradial rests directly upon the truncate upper side of the basals, thereby
separating the first radials all round. Tn others, however, only the firs plate of the
posterior or anal side 1s supported by a basal, that of the other four sides being placed
against the upper corners of the first, and between the second radials, the former
producing an almost pentahedral, the latter a more or less bilateral symmetry.” This
