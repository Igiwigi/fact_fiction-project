of the Society, and which I flatter
myself will be looked upon as the most unequivocal proof of
my discoveries relative to the amazing force of the elastic va-
pour generated in the combustion of gunpowder. When the amazing strength of this barrel is considered,
and when we consider the smallness of the capacity of its bore,
it appears almost incredible, that so small a quantity of powder
as that which was employed in the experiment could burst it
asunder,

But without insisting on: the testimony of several persons of
respectable character, who were eye witnesses of the fact, and
from whom Sir CHaRLEs BLAGDEN received a verbal account,
in detail, of all the circumstances attending the experiment, I
fancy I may very safely rest my reputation upon the silent
testimony which this broken instrument will bear in my fa-
vour; much doubting whether it be in the power of art to burst
asunder such a mass of solid: iron, by any other means than
those I employed.
