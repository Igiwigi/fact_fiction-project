deals almost exclusively with the chameleon, an animal which for centuries has excited
the curiosity of travellers in North Africa, and which, in consequence, has acquired
a popular reputation that is quite remarkable. Thus the hundred pages which Fucus
(1914) devoted to reptilian colour response contain far more references to chameleons
than to all other reptiles taken together. In the present century, with the single
exception of the work of HocBen and Mirvisu (1928) from this laboratory, no further
investigations on the chameleon have been published. Our knowledge of colour
change in reptiles has progressed chiefly through the work of Professor G. H. PARKER
and his many associates. In the New World chameleons do not exist, and conse-
quently the American workers have turned to other lizards, chiefly Anolis and Phryno-
soma. Thus it has come about that most modern workers in this field are relatively
unfamiliar with the chameleon, and have tended to overlook the many interesting
facts concerning colour change in this animal recorded in the earlier literature.

But there is another, and perhaps more cogent reason for the neglect which the
work of the earlier investigators has suffered during the last ten or fifteen years. The
discovery of the endocrine control of pigmentary effectors in amphibia, chiefly through
the investigations of Hoapen and WinTon (1922, 1923), served to discredit all the
previous work on the alleged nervous co-ordination of colour change in this group.
Four years earlier, Reprreup (1918) had brought forward evidence (far less conclusive,
