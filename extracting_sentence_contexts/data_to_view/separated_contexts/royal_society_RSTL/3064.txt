It has not as yet
been. sufficiently investigated by experiment ; for Ds La Rive 8aysF, it requires that
the water shonld be a bad conductor, as, for instance, distilled water, the effect not
happening with strong solutions ; whereas, DuTRocneT says{ the contrary is the case,
and that, the effect is not directly due to the electric current.

1647: BecquestLin his Trait6 de VElectricit6 has brought together the considera-
tions which arise for and against the opinion, that the effect generally is an electric
effect h. Though I have no decisive fact to quote at present, I cannot refrain from
venturing an opinion, that the effect is analogous both to combination and convec-
tion (1623.), being a case of carrying due to the relation of the diaphragm and
the fluid in contact with it, through which the electric discharge is jointly effected ;
and further, that the peculiar relation of positive and negative small and large sur-
faces already referred to (1482. 1503. 1525.), may be the direct cause of the fluid and
the diaphragm travelling in contrary but determinate directions.
