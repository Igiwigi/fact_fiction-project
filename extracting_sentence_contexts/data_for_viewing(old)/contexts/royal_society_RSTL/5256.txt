In Table IL. will be found the differences between the observed temperatures, and
those resulting from the two forms of equation employed. The progress of those
differences in each series seems to follow a distinct law ; there being in all cases a
maximum of negative differences at a short distance from the earth, varying from
about 2500 feet on October 21, to 6000 feet on August 26, followed also in each by a
maximum of positive differences at an additional height of 3000 to 5000 feet. This
peculiar departure from a regular progression will be distinctly traced in the projected
results (Plates XIX.â€”XXII.). It is there seen, in all the four series, that after a steady
decrease of the temperature in the lower portion of the curve, this decrease becomes
arrested, and, for a space of about 2000 feet, the temperature remains almost con-
stant, or even increases by a small amount; the decrease being afterwards resumed
and continued, without much variation, throughout the upper portion of the curve.
In the series of August 17 and 26 this fact is strikingly coincident with a large and
abrupt diminution in the amount of aqueous vapour; the same coincidence being

exhibited, in a less marked manner, on November 10. On October 21, the departure
from a uniform decrease is very decidedly shown in connection with the stratum of
dense cloud passed through. The temperature had been uniformly decreasing until
the thick cloud was reached, when a decided rise commenced, which continued
through the cloud, and for a space of about 600 feet above it ; after which height the
