generation is, indeed, a landmark, but now the challenge is to understand the dynamics that
underlie it, and its possible connection with issues in other areas of science, such as astrophysics
and cosmology.

One viewpoint is that the Higgs boson may be a particle that is as elementary as the electron or
photon, in which case it may be accompanied by many other as-yet-undiscovered particles as in
the supersymmetric theories discussed in the paper by Allanach [8], which may also provide
the dark matter postulated by astrophysicists. Alternatively, as suggested by Grojean [9], the
Higgs boson may be a manifestation of some novel strong interactions that could have interesting
implications for future experiments on the Higgs boson as well as other possible new particles.
The possible connections between the Higgs boson and cosmology are reviewed in the paper by
Shaposhnikov [10]. Puzzling aspects of conventional Big Bang cosmology include its size and
the fact that Euclidean geometry is so successful. One possible way to resolve these puzzles may
be via an epoch of cosmological inflation, perhaps driven by energy in ‘empty’ space related to
the Higgs, a suggestion that is now being challenged by measurements of the cosmic microwave
background radiation.

Many of the outstanding issues posed by the discovery of the Higgs boson will be addressed
during future runs of the LHC accelerator, which will require substantial upgrades of the
experiments, as reviewed in the paper by Wells [11]. This paper provides a glimpse of the
future of Higgs studies that complements the other papers and completes the historical sweep of
this issue.

We hope and believe that this issue will provide specialists and non-experts alike with new
insights into the stakes in the Higgs discovery, how it came about and the perspectives for future
