The material for this research was mainly obtained from the collection of succulent
plants in the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, and I wish to take this opportunity of
thanking the Director for granting permission to use this material. I wish also here
to acknowledge gratefully the courtesy and helpfulness of Mr. T. W. Taytor, of the
Tropical Department of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew.

A group of species of Gasteria and Haworthia was obtained from the interesting
collection of plants belonging to W. Horron, Esq., of Liverpool, to whom my thanks
are cordially given.

The usual cytological fixatives were used. Considerable difficulty was experienced
with certain species, and many collections unfortunately were not useful for the
purpose of this investigation. This was due to the fact that, while anthers in certain
stages appeared to have undergone the various processes of preparation with good
results, others with identical treatment, particularly with the pollen mother cells in
later stages from diakinesis in the heterotype division onwards, were unsatisfactory ;
the chromatin was often clumped and the nuclear contents stained in a hard uniform
manner in which all detail was obscured. Examination showed that the mother cell
wall is usually considerably thickened at these stages. Possibly this hampers the
penetration of the fixative with the result that the fixation is poor. A further difficulty
which has limited the number of species for which results have been obtained is due
to the fact that the sporogenous tissue is sometimes abortive, and in the young flower-
buds this is only brought to light after sectioning.

On the whole, standard and medium strengths of chromacetic gave the most uniformly
