IF the burials are deficient only two thirds of this
number, or 4000, and the births the whole of it;
20 multiplied by 6000, muſt be added to 314,290
on account of the defe&ts in the births ; and, fince
the exceſs of the burials above the births will then
be only 5,246; 30 multiplied by 5,246 or 157, 380,
will be the number to be, added on this account ;
and the ſum, or number of inhabitants, will be
591,580, But if, on the contrary, the burials are
deficient 6000, and the. births only 4.000 ; 80,000
muſt he added to 314,290, on account of the defi-
ciencics in the births ; and! 3o. multiplied by: 9,246,
on account of the exceſs of. the burials aboye the
births, and the whole number of inhabitants will be
671,580. Every ſuppoſition (in theſe calculations ſeems to
me too high; Emgranis from Londow' are; in par-
ticular, allowed the fame' expeFation of continuance in
London with thoſe who are born in it, or who come
to it in the firmeſt part of life, and never afterwards
leave it; whereas it is 'not credible that the former
expectation. ſhould be, fo! much as half | the latter;
But I have a, further | reaſon for thinking that this
calculation-gives/too high numbers, which has with
me. irrefiſtible weight. It has been ſeen that the
number of inhabitants comes out leſs on. the ſuppo-
fition, that the defe@ts \in the chriſtenings are greater

than thoſe 1n, the burials, "Now it ſeems evident
.. that this is really the caſe ; 'and;' as it4s a fact not at-
tended to, I will here endeavour to explain diſtin&tly
the reaſon which proves it. The, proportion of the namber of births in Lon-
don, to the number who live to-be 10'years of age,
15, by the bills, 16 to 5. Any one may find this to
be true, , by ſubtraQting the ' annucl medium of thoſe
who have died under 10, for ſome years paſt, from
the annual medium of births for the ſame number of
years.
