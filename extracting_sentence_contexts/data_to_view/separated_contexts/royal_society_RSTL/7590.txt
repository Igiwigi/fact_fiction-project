The mechanical condition of the gun-cotton most materially influences the result
obtained by its exposure to detonation. A considerable compactness or density, and a
consequently great resistance to motion of the particles, is essential for the detonation
of gun-cotton, as pointed out at page 497. There are, however, several well-known facts, and some results of experiments insti-
tuted with special reference to this s8ubject, which do not appear to be in harmony with
the asxumption that the detonation of nitroglycerine and gun-cotton in the manner
