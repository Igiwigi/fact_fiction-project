and 166 at 12 days. It appears, therefore, that the concentration of mature plasma cells


PLASMA CELLS AND LYMPHOCYTES IN HOMOGRAFTS 487

has approximately doubled in each animal’s grafts between 8 and 12 days. In the first-
set grafts, while there was no correlation between the 8- and 12-day numbers, the 12-day
average was significantly higher—also by a factor of approximately two.

There are two interpretations of the meaning of the correlation in the second-set grafts.
The first is that for all grafts the maximum count of mature plasma cells is approximately
the same, and it is reached at a definite stage in graft destruction. This is disproved by
the fact that the two largest maxima recorded occur in the ‘slow’ grafts, while at the same
time the rapid series show increases from 8 to 12 days, i.e. they have apparently yet to
reach their maxima (a violent upsurge and decline in five separate cases would be most
unlikely to escape detection). This leaves the other interpretation, viz. that the maximum
concentration of mature plasma cells reached varies from one animal to another. It is
apparently attained at or near the end of graft destruction (although this may vary too
since the one’8- to 12-day decrease in cell count that occurred was in a slow series, 304/),
and appears to be greatest in those animals in which destruction is more retarded.

(c) A positive correlation was found in second-set grafts between the concentration of
immature pyronin cells at 8 days and that at 12 days (r,=0-7209, P<0-05). Since the
concentration in the 12-day grafts was not significantly different, on the average, from
that in the 8-day grafts, this indicates that the concentration is approximately the same
