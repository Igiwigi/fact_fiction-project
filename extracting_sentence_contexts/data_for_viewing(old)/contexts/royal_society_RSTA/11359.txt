} When the platinum is observed in a dark room, the first grey light becomes visible at a tempera-
ture of 417° C. It is as the limiting temperature, so far as visible radiation is concerned, that 400° C.
is used in this formula,

§ I have recently made a number of observations on the intrinsic brilliancy of the crater of the
electric are. As these results refer to a study at present far from complete, it will be sufficient to state
here that the intrinsic brilliancy is about 11,000 candle-power per square centimetre. Inserting this
value for b in the formula given above, we obtain 3830 as the temperature of the crater. This fact may
be taken as a confirmation of the formula for temperatures above the melting point of platinum,
though I do not think that it would be wise to attach much importance to a coincidence of this kind.

work have most kindly helped me with their advice on the more difficult theoretical
points, and with their long experience of all the details of experimental work.
