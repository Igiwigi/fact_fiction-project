The stream-lines for any stratum will
therefore still be given by the equation (38), with this modification in the meaning
of the symbol h. It follows that the equator will still be one of the free stream-
lines, but the motion elsewhere may be totally different from what it would be if the
density were the same throughout. It seems probable then that’ the result we have
obtained with reference to the tendency of the currents to set along the equator will
still hold good even when the density is variable, and this conclusion is borne out by

observation, it being noticeable at a glance at the Admiralty current charts that
there is no tendency to cross the equator except in the immediate neighbourhood of
the coasts. The rigorous treatment of the problem of ocean currents, as affected by variations
in the density of the water, appears to be hopelessly beyond the powers of mathe-
matical analysis, and I will therefore leave the subject with the brief indications
already given in this section, and will conclude the paper with an example illus-
trating another means by which possibly ocean currents are in part maintained, and
which is instructive in showing the very important part played by the rotation of
the earth in rendering effective a cause which otherwise could give rise to no
sensible currents.
