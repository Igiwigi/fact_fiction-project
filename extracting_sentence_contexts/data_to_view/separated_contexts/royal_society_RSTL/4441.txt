ELLIS | This example is not open to those objections which, from the formation of the oxides
of nitrogen, might be raised to the other instance, for here the combinations mutually
determine each other. With water, the chloro-sulphuric acid decomposes with the
formation of sulphuric and hydrochloric acids ; but through this experiment we can
distinctly trace back the cause of the formation of the sulphuric acid, in this, as in
the more usual mode of its formation, to the polarization of the element ; and on
considering attentively the mode of the formation of chemical substances, it may be
seen that, the formation of a large class of compounds, among which are the oxides
of chlorine and iodine, is ever preceded by a similar fact. 3. It is well known that when a mixture of hydrogen and any oxide of nitrogen is
passed over heated spongy platinum, the oxide of nitrogen is decomposed and am-
monia and water formed.
