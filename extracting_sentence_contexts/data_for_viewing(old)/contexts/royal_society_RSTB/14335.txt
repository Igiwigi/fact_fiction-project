opsin group composed of vertebrate and annelid non-visual
opsins [16-20]. We have investigated the molecular properties
of the Asop12, a homologue of Opn3 from another malaria _
mosquito Anopheles stephensi (MosOpn3), using spectroscopic () |
and biochemical analysis of the recombinant photopigment to
reveal that MosOpn3 forms a green-sensitive Gi/Go-coupled
opsin-based pigment [21]. Remarkably, MosOpn3 formed
photopigments by binding the 13-cis form as well as the 11-cis
form of A1 retinal. Since 13-cis retinal is thermally generated
from all-trans retinal, a retinal isomer present in every tissue,
the 13-cis retinal-binding property allows for the photopigment
formation of MosOpn3 in ‘non-photoreceptive’ tissues [21].
In fact, we have shown by RT-PCR that MosOpn3 is expressed
in the body, suggesting the presence of MosOpn3 in extraocular
tissues. The analysis also demonstrated that MosOpn3 is
expressed in the head. Here, we investigated in detail the
expression of MosOpn3 in the eyes of the mosquito A. stephensi
to reveal that MosOpn3 is expressed specifically in a single kind
of photoreceptor R7 of the dorsal and ventral ommatidia, where
Asop9, which forms a blue-sensitive Gq-coupled visual pig-
ment, is also expressed. These findings could suggest that this
mosquito species employs two types of phototransduction cas-
cades mediated by Gq and Gi/Go in R7, which possibly could
affect Anopheles colour vision.
