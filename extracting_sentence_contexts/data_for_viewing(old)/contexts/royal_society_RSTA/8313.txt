quick for being confused with the microseisms. It is known that the passage of a
heavily loaded vehicle will cause appreciable vibrations in a neighbouring building
and that they are very quick vibrations. GurENBERG* has, in fact, given examples
and illustrations of vibrations having periods of less than a second due to commercial
and industrial causes, but the vibrations which we record in the seismograms have periods
varying from 10 to 30 seconds, and cannot therefore be identified with the quakes which
the vibrations in buildings or trees will communicate to the ground. We must look
for some other cause for the production of these quakes. We have already seen that
these large period microseisms are shown in Colaba records only on days of pronounced
land and sea breezes. Assuming that the activities of the meteorological factors which
cause these breezes are confined to a strip of land and also a strip of sea, each 10 to 15
miles broad on either side of the coast line, they must, when they become well pro-
nounced, cause surface waves over the sea near the coast. These waves being formed
on comparatively shallow water will have periods quite different from those of the
monsoon type.
