the Feynman diagram tells us that the interaction strength is of the order of one, which strongly : =

However, this monopole production mechanism is totally different from the cosmic monopole if

On the surface, there seems nothing wrong with the Drell-Yan process, because in particle 18

physics all elementary interactions are supposed to be described by Feynman diagrams. But since
the monopole is a topological particle, it is not clear if this picture is correct. In fact, this picture
has a potentially critical shortcoming, that it does not take care of the fact that we need the change
of topology to produce the monopole.

By contrast, the thermal production of the monopole is based on the change of topology
induced by the zero points of the Higgs vacuum. So here, the electromagnetic interaction through
the photon has no role in the monopole production. Moreover, this process can not be described
by any Feynman diagram nor by any known fundamental constant, because it is thermal. This
can be described by a totally different diagram schematically shown in figure 13. The contrast
between two figures is unmistakable.

If this is correct, LHC should satisfy three conditions to produce the monopole. Obviously,
it must have enough energy to produce the monopole pair. So the present 14TeV LHC could
