Total faecal mass influences FGCM concentration, which may
not reflect circulating concentrations [126]. Thus, FGCM
measures provide a useful estimate of GC production in free-ran-
ging animals with appropriate methodological considerations
and biological validation for each species [125]. More relevant to this review is the fact that faeces are
excreted in discrete periods, and therefore, faecal steroid
measures reflect a physiological average of circulating steroid
levels over several hours or days. These measures represent
an estimate of overall production during both low- and high-
production periods. Also, most studies necessarily use oppor-
tunistic sampling and estimate mean steroid production across
long periods (weeks, months).
