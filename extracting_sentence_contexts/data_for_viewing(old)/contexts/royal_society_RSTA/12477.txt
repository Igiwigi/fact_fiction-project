Upset or ACCOMMODATION PRODUCED BY CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE.

Experiment XI.

A bundle of well-annealed iron wires, which had been thoroughly “ accommodated ”
by the heating and cooling process, was tested with the view of ascertaining whether
change of temperature would subpermanently upset the accommodation. This was
found to be the case. For whether the iron was raised from the temperature of the
room to 100° C. or lowered from 100° C. to the temperature of the room, the dissipa-
tion of energy in a cycle was always greater immediately after the change than when
the temperature was maintained constant for some time. Even a small change of
temperature (say two or three degrees) had a sensible effect. This may, in all
probability, account for the fact that if the accommodated metal be left for any
length of time in the room the “accommodation” is almost always found to have
been slightly disturbed, but it may be restored by merely putting the metal through
one or two cycles.

Upset or ACCOMMODATION PRODUCED BY CARRYING THE MAGNETISING FoRCE
BEYOND Certain Limits.

If a wire has been accommodated by repeated cycles within the limits of force
given in Table VII., the accommodation is always disturbed when the force is taken
beyond these limits,
