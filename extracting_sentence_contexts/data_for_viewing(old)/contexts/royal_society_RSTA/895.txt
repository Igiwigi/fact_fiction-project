The reason for calling |G’) a qubit-minor of |G) is that this question is in fact equivalent
to the graph theoretical question of whether G’ is a vertex-minor of G, as we show in
theorem 2.6. In the graph theoretical picture, single-qubit Cliffords operations will be replaced
by operations called local complementations on the graph and single-qubit Pauli measurements
by local complementations and vertex-deletions. A vertex-minor of some graph is by definition
a graph that can be reached by some sequence of local complementations and vertex-deletions.
Equivalence of graphs under local complementations has been studied by Bouchet in [10], which
was used by Van den Nest ef al. [11] to find an efficient algorithm to decide whether two graph
states are equivalent under single-qubit Clifford operations.

The computational complexity of deciding if a graph G’ is a vertex-minor of G, and therefore
if |G’) is a qubit-minor of |G), was, to the authors’ knowledge, previously unknown. In another
paper [12], we show that this decision problem is, in fact, NP-Complete. There is, therefore, no
efficient algorithm that solves this question in general, unless P = NP.

(a) Results

Here, we show that the same problem can be solved in cubic time in the number of qubits of |G)
on instances where the Schmidt-rank width of |G) and the number of qubits of |G’) are bounded.!
This is our first main result which we formally state in theorem 1.2 and prove in §5c.

Theorem 1.2. There exists an algorithm that decides if |G’) is a qubit-minor of |G), and therefore if G'
is a vertex-minor of G, and has running time
