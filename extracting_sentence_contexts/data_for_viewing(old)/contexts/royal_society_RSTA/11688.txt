and the objective, quite a safe working distance, in fact, for all traversing and .
adjusting purposes. With an oil immersion objective of the same power the definition
is simply surprising.

The lines at 60,000 to the inch are not so satisfactorily resolvable without an
immersion lens, which would be inconvenient for the purpose in view ; and the rulings
50,000 to the inch are still a little subject to the same criticism. But the 40,000
rulings to the inch are perfect for the purpose, their apparent separation being so
considerable that one of the spider-lines of the micrometer eye-piece can readily be
placed between two adjacent ruled lines and still leave a clear white space on each side
of the spider-line. The sharpness of the edges of any particular line thus ruled on
speculum metal is quite comparable with that of the edges of the spider-line itself.
All these considerations, combined with the fact that 40,000-to-the-inch rulings are
approximately single wave-length rulings (for red light), render the location signals on
the 40,000-to-the-inch scale remarkably suitable for defining marks on standard bars,
the middle line of the five being the defining line. This is equally true whether they
are employed in the usual manner merely as end marks, or as interval marks in a
scheme of stepping-off by repeated doublings, for the determination of the total
number of wave-lengths in the yard or metre. Such a scheme would have the great
advantage that the final end-defining marks would be of the same accurate character
as all the intermediate ones.

The author has elaborated such a scheme for the determination of the number of
