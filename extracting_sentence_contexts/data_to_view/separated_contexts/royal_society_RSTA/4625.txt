For further details concerning the properties of h-[u], we refer the reader to [10] as
well as to ch. IV of [7]. It was also shown in [1] that for w = £ the problem (1.1)-(1.4) with /,[u] on the right-hand side
of equation (1.1) is, in fact, the two-phase parabolic free boundary problem. The properties of
solutions of this two-phase problem as well as the behaviour of the corresponding free boundary
were completely studied in [11].

Remark 1.4, Owing to directional restrictions on jumps of the hysteresis on the thresholds a
and £, problem (1.1)-(1.4) with w < £ cannot be reduced to the two-phase parabolic problem even
for modified versions of the hysteresis operator.
