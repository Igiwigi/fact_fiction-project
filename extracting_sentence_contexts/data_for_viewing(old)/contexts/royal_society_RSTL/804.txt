muscles, but it is not necessary that the same temperature
should subsist in all muscles during their actions ; neither is it
essential that all the muscular parts of the same animal should
be of uniform temperatures for the due performance of the
motive functions,

It appears that all the classes of animals are endowed with
some power of producing thermometrical heat, since it has
been 80 established in the amphibia, pisces, vermes, and insecta,
by Mr. Joun HuNTER; a fact which has been verified to my
own experience ; the term * cold-blooded‚Äù is therefore only
relative. The ratio of this power is not, however, in these
examples, sufficient to preserve their equable temperature in
cold climates, so that they yield to the changes of the at-
mosphere, or the medium in which they reside, and most of
them become torpid, approaching to the degree of freezing
water. Even the mammalia, and aves, possess only a power
of resisting certain limited degrees of cold; and their surfaces,
as well as their limbs, being distant from the heart, and prin-
cipal blood-vessels, the muscular parts s situated are subject
to considerable variations in their temperature, the influence of
which is known.
