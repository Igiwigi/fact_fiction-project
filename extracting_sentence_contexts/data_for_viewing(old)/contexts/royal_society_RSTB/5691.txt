2. Ten species have been found to be viviparous, and a discussion of viviparity and
its origin within the family Molgulide is given, together with an account of its influence
upon development, pp. 310-317.

3. It is concluded that viviparity is due for the most part to a reduction in adult
size resulting from an early sexual maturity following the colonisation of relatively
exposed rocks, etc., by large sand-living forms. Reduction in adult size lowers the
number of germ cells in the body, viviparity offers a reduction in the rate of elimination
of the eggs, and reduction in adult size lessens the force of the exhalent water current
and encourages any tendency to retain the least buoyant eggs; such eggs are the
relatively larger ones with the least vacuolate follicle cells.

4. Increase in egg size, or else the mere fact of retention within the atrial chamber;
has resulted in the development of a secondary method of hatching, replacing the
primitive and early digestion method, namely, that of rupture, and also in a more highly
differentiated and more active tadpole larva of relatively short free-swimming period.

5. Nine species have been found to have direct or anural development, four of which
are reported for the first time. Two species, Molgula oculata and Molgula simplex,
previously said to have anural development, have been found to possess tadpole larvee,
pp. 299-310.

6. The cleavage of eggs leading to anural development is quite typical of ascidian
eggs in general, contrary to the statement of Lacaze-Durutmrs, pp. 318-319.
