In both cases, under consideration, the desupercooling dynamics occurs faster : RS)
for ellipsoidal crystals in comparison with the evolution of spherical aggregates. As this takes : =I
place, the distribution function is lower and shifted to greater volumes when considering the : Ss
ellipsoidal particles. This behaviour of the solutions is explained by the fact that the surface [8

areas of ellipsoidal particles are larger than those of spherical particles of the same volume,
which means that they emit greater heat of crystallization and more quickly compensate for the
supercooling of a metastable liquid. Let us especially note that when decreasing the ‘diffusion’
coefficient D (or parameter ug) the model with fluctuations transforms into the model without
fluctuations (this transition is studied in detail in [56] for spherical crystals). In conclusion, we note several important aspects of the development of the theory under
consideration in the future.
