Tables X. and XI. show that within the limits of accuracy of the experiments the
pressures in the stucco correspond with pressures in the meerschaum six times as
great. This is exactly according to Law V., Art. 7, from which it appears that the
numerical relation between the corresponding pressures is the relation between the
diameters of the interstices of the meerschaum and stucco plates. This fact also is
confirmed, for not only does it appear that the ratio is independent of the mean
density of the gas, but it is the same for hydrogen as it is for air, showing that the
relation depends only on the nature of the plates,

28. It appeared, however, that as a method of obtaining the corresponding pressures
the comparison of the ratios was not entirely satisfactory, for it involved the assump-
tion that the ratio of corresponding differences of pressure should be exactly the same
as the ratio of corresponding mean pressures ; whereas this would only be the case if
the differences of temperature were exactly the same for both plates. It seemed
desirable therefore to find a means of comparing the curves for the two plates on the
assumption that the corresponding absciss might bear one ratio and the corresponding
ordinates another, or if 1 and 2 are corresponding points, Zzz= ax, while yg=by1.
