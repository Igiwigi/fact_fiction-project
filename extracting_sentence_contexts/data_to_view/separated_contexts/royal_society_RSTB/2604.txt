Bilateral symmetry is much more widely spread amongst Triassic and Jurassic
corals than it has been the custom to admit. Itis a constant feature in many genera,
and in others all stages of transition are seen between bilaterally symmetrical calyces,
even in some cases with a fossular depression, and radially symmetrical calyces. On the other hand, radial symmetry in Triassic and Jurassic corals had no greater
connection with the numbers 6 and 12 than with 8, 10, 14, and in fact all multiples
of 2, Six is the first number at which radial symmetry is attained in the
mesenteries of the embyro, and as such, it seems to have become early fixed for the
primary cycle in many cases, more especially where the calyces were small (Oculinide),
Moreover, if the septa are entoccelic only, the first cycle of septa can only have six
and not twelve (cf. diagram B). Even then, the number eight seems to have been
very often hit upon (Stephanocenia, Astrocenia, Stylina). The broadest internal feature of difference between Paleozoic and later corals is,
perhaps, best expressed in saying that a single well-developed reproductive mesentery,
or one pair, seems to have characterized the majority of the former ; while, with a few
