plane at the point of interest but is more representative of the shear level at this point. For example,
in the case of a-SiO, densification starts at pressure of the order of 7GPa and almost saturates
at pressures more than or equal to 22GPa [70], so that oo evolves from 7 and 22GPa on
densification (this entails the occurrence of strain hardening) but then densification almost
saturates. Lambropoulos proposed that ¢ ~ 1.6-2. In order to account for the progressive decrease
of the densification level observed by Raman scattering spectroscopy with the increase of the
distance from the indentation area, Kermouche et al. [71] inspired by the Shima—Oyane model
for the compaction of porous metal [72] proposed a variant of the Driicker—-Prager criterion


where the square of shear and hydrostatic components are considered, so that the yield surface
is represented by an elliptic curve (blue curve in figure 17). The increase of oo as the glass
densifies simply stems from the fact that densification is a bounded process and is more and
more difficult as the density approaches the ‘saturation’ plateau (located at approx. 22% and 7%
relative density changes for a-SiO) and a standard window glass, respectively). Equation (4.1)
might be the source of several misunderstandings and is thus questionable. For instance, (i) it
suggests a strong similarity between the glass behaviour and the flow of granular media or the
compaction of powder, yet in these latter cases sliding requires some local temporary volume
expansion (so-called Reynolds dilatancy) so that pressure (less than 0) and shear do not work
together, in contrast with the case of silicate glasses where shear seems to promote densification;
and (ii) the increase of the critical yield stress upon deformation might be viewed as a hardening
process similar to those observed in the plasticity of metals whereas it simply derives from the
kinematically bounded nature of the densification. But the most questionable issue is in the : =

implicit choice for an additive contribution of shear and pressure, where for example shear would Sy
