Associated with the equations of motion are appropriate boundary conditions. The free water
surface moves together with the fluid, thus the normal velocity of a fluid particle on this surface is
the normal velocity of the surface itself. At the rigid bottom the situation is similar except for the
fact that the surface is stationary. Below a certain level, one can consider the flow to be stationary,
and therefore one can take at the bottom U = 0. These two impermeability conditions are purely
kinematic, involving only velocity components.
