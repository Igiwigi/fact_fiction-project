degree of porosity ; and as it makes the pore more extensive
in the- transparent than in the opaque kind, contrary to
what we should expect from their specific gravities, it Seems
to follow, that the water was not capable of insinuating itself
into all the pores of the opaque tabasheer. This conclusion
is rendered more probable, when we consider the extreme
difficulty with which the oil of beech nut displaces the last
portions of included air; and it affords a very plausible
explanation of the fact, that the chalky tabasheer cannot be
rendered transparent by the absorption of water.

We are now prepared by the preceding observations, for
investigating the cause of the remarkable paradox exhibited
by the transparent tabasheer, in becoming perfectly opaque
and white, by absorbing a small quantity of water, and per-
fectly transparent when that quantity is increased, As this
effect takes place indiscriminately with all fluids, it cannot be
the result of any chemical action, and therefore its cause
must be sought for in the changes which the light suffers in
traversing the vacuities of the tabasheer.
