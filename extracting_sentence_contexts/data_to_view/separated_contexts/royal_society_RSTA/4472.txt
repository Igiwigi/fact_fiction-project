The solutions show a considerable shrinkage on
dilution, and this fact makes it possible to determine experimentally the s of the
equation. In this part of the communication the work is limited to concentrations of from
30 to 50 gr. anhydrous salt to 100 gr. of water. These limits are imposed
upon us by the fact that weaker solutions have vapour pressures differing little
from that of pure water, and, consequently, measurements of the relative lowering of
their vapour pressures would entail very lengthy experiments,* while the stronger
solution has an osmotic equilibrium pressure of about 130 atmospheres, which is near
the utmost pressure we can obtain with our apparatus.

* Even for a solution of 30 gr. anhydrous salt in 100 gr. water it is necessary to pass the air current
through the vessels for a. period of seven days before the difference between the loss of weight of the
solution and that of the water is sufficient to give accurate results.
