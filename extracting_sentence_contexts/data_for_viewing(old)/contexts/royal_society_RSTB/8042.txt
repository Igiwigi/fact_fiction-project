a fairly complete series of pregnancies in the first half of gestation. One other animal of
this group appeared to have undergone the same process of replacement of the corpora
lutea. This animal (E147, figure 18c, plate 6) was at a slightly earlier stage than E138, and
the replacement had taken place less recently before death, so it must have occurred at
a less advanced stage of gestation. A seasonal influence may account for the fact of one
animal having experienced this wave of ovarian activity at an earlier stage of gestation
, than another, the difference being of the order of 2 months. It is probably significant that
both animals were killed during the time of year when mating is apparently most frequent,
L for the long gestation period, continuing through nearly 2 years, carries the animal through
the usual breeding season some time near the middle of pregnancy, and as E147 became
pregnant at a later date than did E138, any response of its ovaries to a seasonal influence
would overtake it earlier in pregnancy. That these corpora lutea were in fact ‘active’ was
shown by the demonstration of the presence of progesterone in the preserved material.
This was done by Mr D. G. Edgar at Cambridge, using a method of paper chromatography
(Edgar 1952).

It has been remarked that the ovaries contain none but minute follicles without antra
in the late stages of gestation, but follicles with antra always occurred in the ovaries of
animals in the first half of pregnancy, and the series is perhaps not sufficiently extensive

z entirely to preclude the possibility that the process whereby the corpora lutea are replaced
2 during pregnancy, as just described, may be repeated more than once. ‘There is, however,
2 no evidence for it in the available material, and except for the two animals mentioned,
2 the active corpora lutea were remarkably similar in every case.
