Such an equation of state leads to a temperature dependent on
the classical conserved variables and on the fluxes. The conceptual meaning of such temperature
has been discussed in detail in [8,9]. In fact, beyond local-equilibrium, the several definitions
of temperature proposed by extrapolating expressions analogous to equilibrium ones lead to
different values for the respective temperature when the system is in non-equilibrium steady
states [27]. This is logical because, the system being out of equilibrium, equipartition is no
longer obeyed and, therefore, different degrees of freedom may exhibit different values of their
effective temperature. Also, different thermometers, sensitive to different degrees of freedom,
will yield different values of temperature.
