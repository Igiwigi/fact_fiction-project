breaking spin 0 particle masses are equal (mg), all of the supersymmetry breaking gaugino masses
are equal (Mj/2), and that each of the supersymmetry breaking trilinear interactions between spin
0 particles are equal (Ao). There is another input parameter in the theory, tan 8, which measures
how different the two Higgs doublet in the model are. Once these four parameters are set (and a
sign in the Higgs potential, the sign of the so-called 4 parameter), the model can be matched to
current data on Standard Model particle masses, and the masses of all supersymmetric particles
and the Higgs bosons can be predicted. In fact, the initial equal masses for the supersymmetric
particles split apart because of differing quantum corrections (figure 4). We shall assume the
universal pattern of supersymmetry breaking throughout this article.

So far, no direct evidence for supersymmetric particle production at the LHC has been found
(in other words, not enough collisions have been seen which predict high amounts of missing
transverse momentum). In order to display this fact, experiments interpret their data in terms of
exclusion bounds on supersymmetric models. For example, in figure 5, we see exclusion bounds
on the universal model described above. As can be seen from the figure, there are many ways of
sieving the data and looking for supersymmetric particles, with much associated activity by the
experimental collaborations in doing so.
