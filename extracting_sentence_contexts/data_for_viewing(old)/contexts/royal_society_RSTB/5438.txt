THE student of the mammalian chondrocranium, the existing knowledge of which has
recently so excellently been summed up by Marruxs (19216, 1922), cannot but be
surprised at the fact that a mammal so interesting and easily available as the shrew
has not yet been thoroughly studied by modern methods. Of PARKER’s magnificent
pioneer work (1885) it is unnecessary to speak; the only other investigator who has
turned his attention to the shrew is Levi (1909), who did not, however, make a model
of it, and ArnBAcCK Curistrz-LINDE (1907), who studied certain special points only.

The present work was done in the Department of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy
of the Oxford University Museum, on a number of embryos of Sorex araneus, which
I owe to the generosity of my friend Mr. C. 8. Exron, to whom my thanks are here
extended. These embryos were cut into series of sections, and one of these, of an
embryo 11 mm. in length, was reconstructed into a blotting-paper—wax model, at a
magnification of 80 diameters. In the construction of this model I enjoyed the assistance
of Mr. J. H. Brau, which help is hereby gratefully acknowledged. To my wife I
