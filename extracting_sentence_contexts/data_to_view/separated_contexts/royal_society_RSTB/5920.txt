We regard
the acquisition of an amnio-embryonal vesicle and the correlated closed method of
amnion-formation as a purely secondary adaptive phenomenon, by no means primitive,
as Huprecut maintained, but highly specialised. As Hix and Tripp (’24, p. 588)
have pointed out, “in all such cases the blastocyst either becomes directly attached
to the uterine lining as the result of the proliferative activity of the trophoblast over
at least the embryonal pole (?.e., over an area including the covering trophoblast), or
is actually imbedded or in process of becoming imbedded in that lining. We know of
no recorded instance of closed amnion formation in a blastocyst which reaches the
embryonal shield stage whilst still free in the uterine lumen.”

In view of the fact that an amnio-embryonal vesicle can arise quite independently
as a developmental adaptation, in Mammals by no means closely related genetically,
it might be urged by upholders of the diphyletic origin of the two groups of monkeys
that the same developmental parallelism sufficiently accounts for its presence in them. Such a contention I cannot for a moment entertain, since it is not merely the presence
in the two groups of an amnio-embryonal vesicle that we have to account for but also
the remarkable similarity, amounting to practical identity, in the details of the develop-
ment and structure of the blastocyst in the two. That all this similarity can be
