that the constant quantity introduced by integration, is not _
perfectly arbitrary, it must be determined s0 as to make the
equation between & and y fulfil the equation (a). If for in-

d
Stance, we assume @ [2 ] to be equal to a W , we should find

the equation of the curve to be
y=(a+z2)c
c being the constant introduced by integration, and on sub-
$tituting this value of y in (a) we shall find c= o, 0 that
y=(a+a)o
Let us suppose a to be infinite and equal to, then we have
= (=+ 2) c=b += b, since c=0
which is the equation of a straight line parallel to the axis
of the »x's, which in fact agrees with the conditions of the

Problem. If we suppose 9 (2) = 4*= a constant quantity,
we should find

a= vVP=a
this value being substituted in (a) gives for determining c the
equation

(+1) =0
whence c=0 and c=+4/—1, using this latter value we have

a= =1 x VFIP=VD

which is the equation of the circle, and it is obvious, that this
curve satisfies the conditions,

It is very necessary to attend to this mode of determining
the constants, as we should otherwise meet in the solution
with many curves which do not satisfy the conditions ; thus
in the last example, the curve is apparently an hyperbola,
but owing to the constant becoming imaginary, it is in fact a
circle,
