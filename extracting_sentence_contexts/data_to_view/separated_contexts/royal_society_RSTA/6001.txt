The psychometric experiments with DAC demonstrated that the online feedback conveyed
by the developed system allowed the subjects to identify contact patterns delivered to the
most important functional areas of the hand, including the lateral and volar side of the index
finger, fingertips of all fingers and thumb, and the palm. This included simple patterns, such
as contact on a single area, as well as more complex sensations arising from simultaneous
touches on two areas, single and double sliding contacts, and comprehensive patterns activating
many pads simultaneously. Importantly, the subjects could identify these interaction patterns
despite the fact that they included natural variability due to slight variations in the way

the experimenter touched the skin (e.g. inconsistent timing, different pad activations). While : =
we have previously demonstrated that such patterns can be perceived from a single finger : =
[63], in the present work we show that the electrotactile stimulus can be delivered to a :3
larger area, following mechanical interactions across the whole hand. An important point : =
is that the current system provided somatotopic feedback, which is expected to facilitate ZR
perception and interpretation of the stimulus [80].
