health, disease risk (other than cancer) and conditions such
as stress have largely yielded inconsistent results. Several, but
not all, studies suggest that that basal telomerase expression/
activity appears to be upregulated in autoimmune disorders,
with differences between active and inactive disease [36], and
between early- and advanced-stage disease [37]. Findings in
the context of psychiatric disorders such as depression, schizo-
phrenia and post-traumatic stress disorder appear to be more
heterogeneous [38-42]. The same pattern of mixed findings
is evident in the context of chronic stress exposure, with
some suggesting suppression [7,43â€”45] and others suggesting
stimulatory effects of stress on telomerase activity [10,46]. This
heterogeneity may be a consequence of the fact that telomerase
is regulated in response to various factors such as cell-cycle stage
[9], stress hormones [7] and inflammation [47,48], which, in
turn, may introduce bias based on time of day of blood
sample collection [49], current infections [47,48], physical exer-
cise [50] or acute stress exposure status [7]. In addition,
elevations in basal telomerase may reflect the counter-regulatory
(compensatory, secondary) adaptations to states/conditions
that reduce telomere length. For example, high telomerase in
conjunction with shorter telomere length may be indicative of
a physiologically stressed system [10]. Finally, because telomer-
ase is normally expressed at very low levels in resting cells, the
lower limit of detection of many telomerase assays may place
