The periodic time of the satellite Phobos in 7 hrs. 39 m. ; therefore Phobos must be
approaching Mars. It does not seem likely that it has ever been remote from the
planet.

The eccentricities of the orbits of both satellites are small, though somewhat
uncertain. The eccentricity of the orbit of Phobos appears however to be the larger
of the bwo.

Tf the viscosity of the planet be small, or if oceanic tidal friction be the principal
cause of change, both eccentricities are diminishing ; but if the viscosity be large,
both are increasing. In any case the rate of change must be excessively slow. As we
have no means of knowing whether the eccentricities are increasing or diminishing
this larger eccentricity of the orbit of Phobos cannot be a fact of much importance
either for or against the present views. But it must be admitted that i is a slightly
unfavourable indication.

The position of the proper plane of a satellite is determined by the periodic time of
the satellite, the oblateness of the planet, and the sun's distance. The inclination of
the orbit of a satellite to its proper plane is not determined by anything in the system.
Hence it is only the inclination of the orbit which can afford any argument for or
against the theory.

The proper planes of both satellites are necessarily nearly coincident with the
equator of the planet ; but it is in accordance with the theory that the inclinations of
the orbits to their respective proper planes should be small.f
