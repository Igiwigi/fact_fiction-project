It is accordingly a matter of considerable difficulty to photograph
the spectra of these stars, as most of them are below the third magnitude. (1.) SuB-DIVIsIon «.
Characteristics of the Spectra. Notwithstanding the fact that the visual spectra of these stars are characterised by
conspicuous flutings, the region more refrangible than F consists almost entirely of
dark lines. Indeed the only indication of flutings in this region in any of the stars
Tamed are near wave-lengths 4763 and 4585, and these vary in intensity in the
different stars. The flutings are stronger in « Herculis than in any of the other stars
in the Table, as will be seen on reference to Plate 26, and they are still stronger in the
Spectrum of Mira Ceti, as seen in a photograph kindly forwarded to me by Professor
Picxrrivc.
