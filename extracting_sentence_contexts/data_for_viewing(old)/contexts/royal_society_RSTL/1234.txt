g6o Mr. How's Observations on the Camel's Stomach

anterior, On pressing on this part a fluctuation of its con=
tents could be distinctly perceived. A trocar with the canula
was plunged into the most prominent of the cells, and on
withdrawing it there passed through the canula 1902. of
water of a yellow colour, but unmixed with any solid matter.
This fact having been ascertained, the first stomach was laid
open, on the left side, at a distance from the cellular structure,
and the solid contents were all removed. While this was
doing some water flowed out of the cells, and some out of
the second stomach, but the greater part was retained,‚Äù That
in the second stomach was nearly pure: while the other was
muddy, and of a yellow colour, tinged by the contents of
the first stomach. On examining the cellular structure no
part of the solid food had entered it, nor was there any in the
second stomach : those cavities having their orifices 80 con-
structed as to prevent the solid food from entering, even when
empty.
