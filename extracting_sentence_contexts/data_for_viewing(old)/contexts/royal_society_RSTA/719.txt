]. Introduction

Wall turbulence plays a critical role in a wide range of engineering and physics problems.
Despite the acknowledged importance of improving understanding of wall turbulence and an

extensive literature recording advances in the study of this problem, fundamental aspects of 1
wall turbulence remain unresolved. The enduring challenge of understanding turbulence can be :2
partially attributed to the fact that the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, which are known to govern : =
its dynamics, are analytically intractable. Even though there has been a great deal of progress in [3
simulating turbulence [1-6], a complete understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying : =
turbulence remains elusive. This challenge has motivated the search for analytically simpler and 8
computationally more tractable dynamical models that retain the fundamental mechanisms of eri
turbulence while facilitating insights into the underlying dynamics and providing a simplified : a
platform for computation. A statistical state dynamics (SSD) model comprising coupled evolution : =
equations for a mean flow and a perturbation covariance provides a new framework for a
analysing the dynamics of wall turbulence. The restricted nonlinear (RNL) approximation in 78

which the perturbation covariance is approximated using a finite number of realizations of the
perturbation equation that share the same mean flow provides complementary tools for tractable
computations.
