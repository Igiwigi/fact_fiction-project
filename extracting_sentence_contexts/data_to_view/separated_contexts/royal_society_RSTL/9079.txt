J. B, HANNAY ON THE MICRORHEOMETER,

In his earlier experiments upon gases, GRAHAM gave to the passage of gases through
capillary tubes the name © transpiration,” which expresses admirably what-is meant ; but
when he came to work with liquids he still used the term © transpiration,” although the
laws relating to liquids were quite different from those relating to gases ; and as the
term © transpiration ” is nob translatable into other languages, being already in use (as in
French, for © perspiration ”), T have decided to abandon the title, and 8nbstitute for it
*microrheosis” (pupss and pew), and to call the instruments above described *microrheo-
meters.” The microrheosis of a liquid, then, is the time taken for the passage of a
certain volume of liquid through a tube of such dimensions that the rate of flow varies
as the pressure, the standard of comparison being in the meantime water. Tt appeared probable at the outset that the friction in the microrheometer might be [

due, in a great measure, to the cohesion of the liquid ; and this led me to seek for a i
method of determining the cohesion of all liquids (which has been published else-
where),* but I 80on found that the two phenomena were not comparable—-in fact, the
cohesion had almost no effect in retarding the flow. I need nob quote the work here,
as there will be plenty of proof further on to show the real cause of the retardation. In this paper I shall confine myself to the work I have done on saline solntions, and on
the substance (water) in which the salts are dissolved.
