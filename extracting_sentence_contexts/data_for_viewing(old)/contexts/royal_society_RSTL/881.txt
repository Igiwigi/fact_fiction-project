great, or indeed a greater diminution, than gold which is but moderately ductile :
j and the whole of the experiments which have been made for the purpose of the present
| investigation, concur to show, that gold which is neither extremely soft nor extremely
| hard, is best adapted to resist friction in general.

186 Mr. HatcnerrT's Experiments on the various Alloys,

Just capable of being rolled and stamped, seems to be equally
improper for the purpose of coin. For, even supposing that hard
gold suffered, in every case, less by friction than that which is mo-
derately ductile, (which is not however the fact,) and allowing
that standard gold may, by a mixed alloy, be rendered as hard
as gold reduced by copper to 18 carats, without changing the
standard proportion of gold, yet it would be very difficult always
to make such standard gold of an uniform degree of hardness.
Moreover, by some experiments which I purposely made at the
Mint, upon the rolling and stamping of gold of different qualities,
it evidently appeared, that gold equal in hardness to that of 18
carats, could not be employed with advantage ; for, the addi-
tional labour which was required for the rolling and stamping of
this hard gold, the frequent failure in making the impression,
and the battering and breaking of the dies, fully proved, that
the expense and difficulty attending the working of such gold,
