At one stage in the development of the tooth of Echinocyamus (Tuten, 1892) the
first cone is furnished with thorny projections. This might suggest that the first cone
is distinctly larval. But it must always be borne in mind that it forms, as it were, the
foundation of the whole tooth. From the description of the tooth of a young specimen
of Goniocidaris given by Lovin (1892), it seems as if the lamellze were all simple in this
case, neither does SPENCER (1904) mention a double series of lamelle in the tooth of
Paleodiscus ferox. Thus the primitive form of the Echinoid tooth consisted apparently
of a succession of lamellee or “ cones.” In the Echinopluteus of HZ. miliaris one rudi-
ment of a pair originates slightly in advance of the other. This might suggest that the
complex tooth has arisen from a linear series, the component parts of which have, owing
to crowding, become somewhat displaced, and have arranged themselves in pairs, the
first remaining single. Otherwise there seems to be no explanation of this fact.

The very open meshwork exhibited by the developing plates in the pluteus is probably
a larval characteristic for, after metamorphosis, the developing plates grow more rapidly
and are, from the first, more compact with the exception perhaps of those which are
formed in the peristome. The spines, which all develop in the same way as the inter-
ambulacral (typical) ones of the pluteus, are also from the first more solid, the prongs
and cross bars being more robust.

The young forms of Goniocidaris canaliculata and of Strongylocentrotus (‘ T'oxo-
pneustes *) droaebachensis figured by Lovin (1892), and of Strongylocentrotus lividus
figured by Unison (1913, Plate VI, fig. 6), agree with H. miliaris in having only ten plates
in the peristome at first. Those in the case of Goniocidaris (Lovin, 1892, Plate II,
