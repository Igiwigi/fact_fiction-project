though he only suggested it, not considering the evidence sufficient to come to a
&lefinite conclusion) and Packarp, advocated the second. The latter writer puts the
@vidence in favour of this view very clearly, so I will quote his words (14) :—
8‘ The phenomenon of two pairs of limbs to a segment, so unique in Tracheata, may be
Bxplained by reference to the Phyllopoda among the Branchiata. The parallel is quite
exact. The larvee in both groups have but a single pair of appendages to a segment ;
“Hhe acquisition of a second pair in the Diplopods is clearly enough a secondary
‘gharacter, and perhaps necessary in locomotion in a cylindrical body with no sterna.”
Ste adds in a note :—* It is plain that, as BaLrour suggests (‘Comparative Embryo-
ogy,’ p. 324), the double segments have not originated from a fusion of two primitively
Alistinct segments. There is, however, a misconception as to the nature of the ‘double
Begments.’ They are not so, in fact. The scutes are single, undivided, but the
ventral region is alone imperfectly double, bearing two pairs of appendages, just as

ingle segments of Apodidee may bear from two to six appendages ; the differentiation is
grontined to the ventral limb-bearing region and limbs alone; the dorsal part of the
segment does not share in the process.”
3 The results of the present paper, however, show that the double character of the
E egments is a much more essential one than is assumed by the acceptance of the above
Eom The circulatory system, the tracheal system, the nerve-cord, and above all the
Amesoblastic segmentation, all show this duplication ; and the only parts of the double
segments which are single are the broad plate covering the dorsal and lateral parts
of the body, and the stink glands, which, as I have shown, are invaginated in the
dorsal plates during development. Looking at the paleontology of the subject, we see
