WINKLER, as reported elsewhere, believes a part
(the lateral) of the sensory fifth serves this same purpose. His criterion is based upon
the terminals of cells in that region being the same as those of the medial lemniscus. Such a finding, if it be a fact, would allow this connection a proprioceptive function. The chief tecto-cerebellar systems originate from the midbrain layers predominantly
optic and probably would aid in the maintenance of tonic influence upon muscle groups
in response to stimulation of the second nerve (see Scummazono (1912) in the bird). The writer could identify none of the direct efferent systems outlined for birds by
FRENKEL (1909) as the cerebello-spinal or bulbar tract, nor could a floccular commissure
be demonstrated.
