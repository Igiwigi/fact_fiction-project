Aptelo No. 23.—Completion of the theory in Liouville, and comparison with analogous
theorems of Hes.

In order to convert the foregoing theorem into its reciprocal, we must replace the
cubic U=0 by a curve of the third class, that is we must consider the coordinates which
enter into the equation as line coordinates ; and it of course follows that the coordinates
which enter into the equation PU=0 must be considered as point coordinates, that, is
we must consider the Pippian as a curve of the third order: we have thus the theorem ;
The locus of a point such that the tangents drawn from it to three given conics (the first
or conic poles of any three lines with respect to a curve of the third class) form a pencil

involution, is the Pippian considered as a curve of the third order. This in fact
Smpletes the fundamental theorem in my memoirs in Zzouville above referred to, and

blishes the analogy with Hrsss's results in relation to the Hessian ; to show this
8et out the two series of theorems as follows :—
S Hrs, in his memoirs © On Curves of the Third Order and Curves of the Third Class,”
Srelle, tt. xxviii. xxxvi. and xxxvili., has shown as follows ;—
2 (z) The locus of a point such that its polars, with respect to the three conics X=0,
F=0, Z=0 (or more generally its polars with respect to all the conics of the series
- 0) meet in a point, is a curve of the third order V=0.

BZ (3) Conversely, given a curve of the third order V=0, there exists a series of conics
Kieh that the polars with respect to all the conics of any point whatever of the curye
