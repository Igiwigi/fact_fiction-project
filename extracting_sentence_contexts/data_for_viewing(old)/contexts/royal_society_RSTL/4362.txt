retain much of the primitive rib-like form they presented in the foetal Chelone, and
are seen applied, as it were, to the inner (upper) surface of those dermal plates. The
median extremities of the true endo-skeletal parts have begun to expand, and to shoot
out the pointed rays of tooth-like processes which they retain in the Trionyces and
the marine Chelonia (fig. 3). From the flattened and expanded inner and lower end
of the hyosternal (fig. 7, ks) the main body of the bone arises and curves upwards,
outwards and forwards, in the form of a long and slender rib, and applies itself to the
inner and fore part of the first elongated pleurapophysis of the carapace, extending as
far as the incipient dermo-costal plate ; the rib-like part is represented detached from
the rest of the hyosternal in fig. 5, ks. As the inner and lower toothed border of the
endo-skeletal part of the hyosternal touches the outer border of the entosternal bone,
the haemal arch of the first segment of the thoracic-abdominal case (second vertebra
of the back) is completed independently of the marginal pieces ; and, in point of fact,
the third and fourth marginal plates (fig. 8, m) are simply applied to the outer side of
the hyosternal (/) where it bends upwards to join the first long plenrapophysis (p/) or
rib of the carapace. The most obvious, and, I believe, the most natural explanation
of this first complete segment of the thoracic-abdominal region of the young Tortoise,
according to the typical vertebra, and the composition of the corresponding segment in
the nearest allied Vertebrata, is—that the centrum (PI. XIII. fig. 8, c), the neural arch
(xs), and the pleurapophysis (pl), are the parts 80 indicated by the initial letters ; that
the byosternals (4) are the hamapophyses (ternal ribs or costal cartilages), and the
entosternum (/s, s) is the © haxmal spine* or sternum proper. The hyposternals in the
young Testudo resemble the hyosternals, but are sborter; the slender rib-like portion
which curves upwards and outwards applies itself to the back part of the extremity
of the fifth rib of the carapace (fig. 5, ps), almost filling the interspace, for one-fourth
