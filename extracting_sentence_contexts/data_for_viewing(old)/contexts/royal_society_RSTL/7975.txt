of the point B', haye been omitted. Enough have been drawn to show the principle of their construction. In
fig. 3 the series of quadrifocal lines of disturbance is complete.

equal to 5, 5 3% 1 and if of the first parameter; and thus were drawn the.
five cycnoid curves marked respectively 11, 22, 33, 44, and 66. The lines of uni-
form current and of disturbance used in drawing these curves are omitted in the
engraving.

This last figure illustrates the fact that, with a given set of foci, and a given Para-
meter for the inner pair of foci, the cycnoid becomes leaner and more hollow at the
bow as the parameter for the outer pair of foci diminishes; also that, with large values
of the second parameter, that curve is convex throughout, like the line marked 66; and
that for some intermediate value the hollowness just yanishes, as is very nearly the case
in the line marked 44. It is obvious that any degree of fineness may be given to the
entrance by increasing the distance of the second foci from the first, and at the same
time using a small second parameter.
