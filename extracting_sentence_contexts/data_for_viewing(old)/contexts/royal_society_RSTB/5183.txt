(3) Movement, Direction, AND RerractivE Power or THE HyEs.

One should expect retraction of the eyes into the sockets to be a very common pheno-
menon in the Reptiles, on account of the immovability of the head. and the constant
danger to the eyes from their position close to the ground ; but apart from this retrac-
tion I have observed no movement in the eyes of the Amphibia. The axes are asa rule
directed more forwards, 7.¢., more towards the median line of the body than in the
reptiles, but among the frogs and toads I have invariably met with a considerable
divergence from the median line, amounting to 45 or 50 degrees.

In the lizards the axis of the eye is always nearly at right angles to the body ; in fact,
it may even exceed 90°, i.e., the axis of the eye may be directed slightly backwards.
For example, in Lacerta simonyi and L. viridis, it amounts to 100°. The Sphenodon
possesses a divergence of 85 degrees.

The chameleons, as is well known, are able to turn either eye at will separately in
any direction, so that one eye may be turned upwards, and the other downwards, so as
to embrace an angle of as much as 160 degrees between them.

The axes of the eyes of the iguanas form an angle of about 85 degrees, i.e., about 42
degrees for each eye, as measured from the long axis of the body.

In the snakes the eyes have a considerable range of movement. (Generally speaking,
