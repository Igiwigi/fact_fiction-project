Ib is of interest

S = to observe in the columns showing the increase over the unmanured produce, that there

= actually less of the deep-roating and self-reliant Lotus corniculatus with than without

Dhe manure, and that almost the whole of the increase is due to the comparatively

lamrooking Lathyrus. Tt is, however, worthy of note that the partial separations

of the second crops indicate a lower proportion, and scarcely any more actual produce,

Sof the mixed leguminous herbage with the manure than without manure ; and ib is

also significant that, in these second crops, the 7yfoliums bear @ much larger propor-

-2 tion to the Lathyrus than in the first. An exanination of the samples of the partial

3 8eparations leads to the conelusion that, this is explained by the fact that, owing to the

S habit and conformation of the plants, new and stronger shoots are more freely pro-

E duced from the thick-branched stock of the Trefoils which remain after cutting, than

Efrom the comparatively thinner and less branching stock of the Zathyrus, in which

EZ the relatively few shoots that are produced after cutting are of very slender and feeble

Z character.

= Among the Miscellanew, Rumez Acetosa is the mosb prominent on the mineral

S manured plot, as it was also on the ammonia plot, and on that with the larger amount

2 of nitrate of s0da, But the mineral manured plot was more favourable to Conopodium
denudatum, and to Achillea JMillefolium, both of which, however, fluetuated very

Q greatly in amount, according to season. No other miscellaneous plant, except Zuzula
campestris, was in any noticeable degree of prominence, The last division of the
table shows that Plantago lanceolata, and the various species of Ranunetlus taken
collectively, were ip each year in actually less amount with the mineral manure than
without manure ; 80 also, but in a less degree, was Pimpinella Saxifraga, and, in two
out of the four years, Luzula campestris. The only plants which uniformly yielded more with the mineral manure than without
manure, were Rumes Acetost and Conopodium denudatum, Achillea Millefolium doing
80 in three out of the four years.
