An axis is always torsal or oscular; when it
is torsal, the plane touching along the axis contains a third line which is the © trans-
versal” of such axis; but a transyersal may be a mere line, a ray, or an axis; in the case
XVI=12—4C,, each transyersal is a transversal in regard to two axes.

23. In the general case I=12, each of the 27 lines is, as already mentioned, part of

the node-couple curve; and the node-couple curye is made up of the 27 lines, and is
thus a curye of the order 27. In fact each plane through a line meets the cubic surface
in this line, and in a conic; the line and conic meet in two points, and the plane (that
is in any plane) through the line is thns a double tangent plane touching the surface at
the two points in question ; the locus of the points of contact, that is the line itself, is
thus part of the node-couple curye. But in the other cases, TT to XXI, certain of the
lines do not belong to the node-couple curve (this will be examined in detail in the
several cascs respectively); but I wish to show here how in a general way a line passing
through a node, say a nodal ray, is not part of the node-couple curve. To fix the ideas,
consider the 8urface II=12—C, ; there are here through C, six lines, or say rays:
attending to any one of these, a plane through the ray meets the surface in the ray itself
and in a conic; the ray and the conic meet as before in two points, one of them being
the point C,: the plane touches the surface at the other point, but i& does not touch the
s817face at C,.
