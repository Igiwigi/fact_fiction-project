the weight of a quantity may be defined with respect to any sclected variable therein as the 8um
of the weights in respect to such variable of the several coefficients of which the quantity is com-
posed (the weight of each several coefficient meaning the index of the power of the selected variable

definitions of weight\may be perfectly well veponeiled with each, other by understanding. the weight

in respect to unity, of such quantity when the given functions are treated as homogeneous fattetions
of x and 1.
