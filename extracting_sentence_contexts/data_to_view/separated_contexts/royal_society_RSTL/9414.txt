MR. G. 1. ROMANES ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF MEDUSA., 187

are to a large extent novel, I have thought it desirable to insist on their theoretical
importance rather than on that of facts which are better known, and which serve to
uphold existing views respecting the action of ganglia. Nevertheless, even within the
limits of the Medusz, I have found only too much reason for concluding that the full
explanation of natural rhythm must be more complex than that which I believe to
apply to artificial rhythr. In particular I may allude to the case of Sarsia.
