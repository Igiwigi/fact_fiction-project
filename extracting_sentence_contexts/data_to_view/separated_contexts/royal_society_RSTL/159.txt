Since therefore carbon, though: placed under the most
favourable circumstances for abstracting from the muriatic acid,
and combining with, its oxygen, evinces no such tendency, it |
may be inferred, that if the muriatic acid be an- oxygenated
substance, its radical has a stronger affinity for oxygen than |
charcoal possesses. |

Though the first impressions excited in my mind' by the total |
failure of the above experiments, in accomplishing one of the |
| greatest objects of modern chemistry, have induced me for some
| time to withhold them from the society, I am satisfied by reflec- |
tion, that this communication is not without expediency. The

were-such as, after mature deliberation, appeared to me most to
promise success; and the experiments were attended with a
degree of labour, which can only be estimated by those who
have been engaged in similar pursuits; not one third of those
which were really made having been described, in the foregoing
account of-them. It may spare therefore to others, a Å¿ruitless
application. of time and. trouble, to. be made acquainted with
what I have done; and 'the collateral facts, which have pre-
sented themselves in the- inquiry, are perhaps not without
curiosity or value. From the result of these experiments, I apprehend, all hope
must be. relinquished, of effecting the decomposition of the
muriatic acid, in the way of single elective affinity. They
furnish also a strong probability, that the-basis of the muriatic
acid is some unknown body; for, no. combustible substance
with which we are acquainted, can retain oxygen, when sub-
mitted, in contact with charcoal, to. the action of electricity, or
of a high temperature.
