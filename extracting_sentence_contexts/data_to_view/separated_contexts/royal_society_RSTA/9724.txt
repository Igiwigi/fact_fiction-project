This fact is interesting, but, in the absence of any explanatory theory,
does not lead to anything further. Wacnsmvuts also found that the observations could be represented to within 2 per
cent. or 3 per cent. by the formula

x +
ty = 1+Ap’/p ie Bp/p’

(modelled on a similar formula for the viscosity of gases which we shall consider
presently). As there were only four observations and two empirical constants the
fact is not very remarkable; when p = 0 of course 3,, = 9’, and when p’ = 0 we have
3. =. A much better agreement was obtained by allowing the empirical constants
A and B (obtained by the method of least squares) to be imaginary. In this case the
expression reduces to the quotient of a cubic by a quartic homogeneous expression in
the variables p, p’; as WacusmutH remarks, the relation is good as an interpolation
formula, but that is all.
