During fixation, the secretion appears to remain undistorted, and it exhibits no
visible variation with all the fluids used in this investigation (cf. the albumen).
These facts, taken in conjunction with the viscosity of the secretion in the free state,
suggest that the secretion is quite different from albumen. It must be noted,
however, that the appearance of the glands at any secretory stage in the isthmus
is closely similar, after Zenker-formol fixation, to the single resting phase of the
albumen glands, ¢f. fig. 15, Plate 16 with fig. 10, Plate 15. The identification of the
isthmal glands as albumen glands, by several previous authors, is possibly due to a
confusion of these individual stages.

(b) The ciliated epithelium during secretion—The individual isthmal folds have a less
evenly rounded form in section, which is possibly due to the fact that the tubular
glands of this region do not expand to the same extent as in the albumen region.
The tips of the folds are characteristically angular, and the apertures of the tubular
glands, situated in marked depressions of the ciliated epithelium, are very much
more numerous than in other regions of the oviduct. The crypts are generally
entirely open so that their deeper recesses are rarely obscured by close contact
between adjacent folds. Some of the cells in the lining epithelium remain ciliated
and others transform into gland cells which are peculiar to this region. Under low
power, however, no stretching or extreme mucous activity in the epithelium, is
noticeable, so that the columnar cells are uniformly higher (25 ) than they are in
the albumen region. The ciliated cells retain their form throughout the secretory
cycle of the isthmus, being unconstricted by adjacent glandular cells. Their nuclei
are usually apical in position, figs. 15 and 17, Plate 16.
