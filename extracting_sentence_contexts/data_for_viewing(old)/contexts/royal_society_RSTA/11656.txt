itself is to some extent the source of the heat evolved, but it is not at present possible
to discriminate between the various possible sources of heat in a complex reaction.
The fact, however, that both the temperature and intensity of a change of this kind
varies with the concentration of the dissolved element finds it analogue in the higher
arrest-points of low-carbon steel.

A point of some difficulty yet remains to be dealt with. The data of the cooling-
curves show that this heat-evolution diminishes to zero at or near the concentration
of the eutectic alloy, and it is therefore evident that the transformation is confined to
the structurally free lead constituent, the lead-rich constituent of the eutectic taking
no part in the reaction, This fact can only be reconciled with the Phase Rule by
supposing that while the structurally free @ solution and the lead-rich constituent of
the eutectic must be the same phase when first formed, yet the lead constituent of
the eutectic retains the 8 state (in meta-stable equilibrium) when the transition
temperature is passed. This explanation is rendered probable by the observation
already described, that the crystallites of the lead constituent are generally completely
surrounded by a sheath of pure tin which separates them from the lead constituent of
the eutectic ; this envelope of tin no doubt serves to prevent the propagation of the
reaction from the structurally free 8B body to the corresponding constituent of the
eutectic.

The view that owing to the retention of the 8 state in a meta-stable form the lead-
rich constituent of the eutectic is not identical with the stable Â« body is further borne
