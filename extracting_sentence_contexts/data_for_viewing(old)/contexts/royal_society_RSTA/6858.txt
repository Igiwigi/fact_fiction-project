f §§ 13-14,—the approximate treatment of §§ 11-12 had not then (1938-40) been devised.
8 Starting from some assumed distribution of y (say, y = /, simply), the procedure was to
compute p’2q’? from (22) for mesh-points of the rectangular net, taking values of / from
figure 7c; then to deduce y-values in accordance with figure 6 and initial values of residual
forces according to (32). Next, with ‘patterns’ computed (roughly) from (35), a partial
liquidation of residuals was effected; after which the whole procedure could be repeated
with its starting assumption thus improved. Although laborious the method entailed no
serious difficulty, and 3-figure accuracy (at least) is claimed for the results presented in
figures 8-11.
* Cf. Binnie & Woods (1938).
+ Ofside 7/3-548. Figures 7 reproduce only about one-half of the length of our actual diagrams.

+ Full use was made of the fact that log / is plane-harmonic (cf. Part V, § 17), and in fact the values given
in figure 7c satisfy the requirement with 5-figure accuracy.
