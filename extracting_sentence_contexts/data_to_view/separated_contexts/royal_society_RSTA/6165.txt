The proposed methodology has wide applicability, since
excess-of-zeros count data arise in many fields. Our motivating application involves answers
to a questionnaire on the use of WhatsApp in India during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our
analysis identifies a two-level clustering of the subjects: the outer cluster allocation reflects daily
probabilities of engaging in different WhatsApp activities, while the inner level informs on
the number of messages conditionally on the fact that the subject is indeed receiving/sending
messages on WhatsApp. Any two subjects are clustered together if they show a similar
pattern across the multiple responses. We find three different well-distinguished respondent
behaviours corresponding to the three outer clusters: (i) subjects with low probability of
daily utilization; (ii) subjects with high probability of sending/receiving all types of messages
and (iii) subjects with high probability for all considered messages except for non-forwarded
messages in personal chats.
