Sroots or branches, and I incline to the belief that they were organs of fructification”
Moe. cit., p. 210). My young friend Mr. THomrs0N has recently collected a fine series
bf these Ulodendra from the Edinburgh coalfield, some of which conclusively settle
Sthis question. I am indebted to him for a fine specimen, in which the branch bifurcates
Sin the usual Lepidodendroid manner. The large characteristic scars are seen, as usual,
n both the inner and outer surfaces of these branches. The inner series is curious,
-2gince one of them is located at the exact point of bifurcation of the branch—a position
from which no zerial root could possibly be given off. The cars average about 0'9 in
Sdiameter. Mr. Tromes0N has also obtained two branches, each of which exhibits the
Susual rows of scars, but in each specimen one Scar Supports an actual cone mn ﬆty. The
Sactual area, of attachment of each cone to its branch is a very circumscribed one, being
<=wholly different from that of a secondary to a primary branch. On the other hand,
Sthe diameter of the entire base of the cone is very considerable—corresponding, in fact,
—With that of the peripheral margin of each characteristic Ulodendroid scar. It is now
Yeasy to understand these scars. We constantly find the greater part of their surfaces
Zoovered with the modified bases of leaves. The cone obviously originated as a s8mall
Slateral bud, but its development into a branch was arrested, leading to the formation
Rf a strobilus. As this expanded, though the actual attachment of its central axis to
its parent branch was a very circumscribed one, the entire base of the cone became
broad, and as a result of its active growth it pressed down the leaves of the branch
over an area corresponding to the diameter of that base. The very large scars seen on
many 8pecimens bear no relation to the size of the cone, but have obviously increased
in size through the continued growth of the stem after the deciduous strobili had
fallen.
