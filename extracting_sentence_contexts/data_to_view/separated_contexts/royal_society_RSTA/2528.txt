Although there is still street flooding in the
33-year storm, the upstream interventions significantly reduce the maximum extent. This is very
interesting because in figure 5a, the 20- and 33-year storms are shown to prolong the time the
outfall is submerged. In fact, the attenuating impact of the interventions is delaying the pulse in
