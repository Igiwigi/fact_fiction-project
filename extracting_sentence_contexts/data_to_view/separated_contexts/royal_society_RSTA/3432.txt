LBVs seem like the most straightforward interpretation of these progenitors. Placing the detected source on an HR diagram to deduce its initial mass, however, is not so
straightforward because of one caveat—pre-SN eruptions are inferred to account for their dense
CSM, so they might have been in an outburst state at the moment when the pre-SN archival data
were obtained (which would, of course, still point to an LBV-like progenitor). In fact, some cases
of pre-SN eruptions have been detected, as described next.


(d) Directly detected precursor eruptions

Observations have already confirmed the idea that SNe with strong CSM interaction may have
suffered violent LBV-like eruptive instability in the few years before core collapse, because there
are several cases where the precursor eruptions were directly detected as dramatic photometric
variability. The first documented case was the outburst 2 years before SN 2006jc [61,62], which
was unusual in that it was an H-poor event (Type Ibn). SN 1961V, mentioned above, also showed
slow S Dor-like variability in the years before its SN (see [3]), although for many years it was
not considered as a SN.
