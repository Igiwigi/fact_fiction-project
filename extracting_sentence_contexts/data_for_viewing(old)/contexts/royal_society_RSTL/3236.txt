both in the Royal Cork Institution, and in the Royal Dublin Society. Cireum-
stances which it is unnecessary to mention, have hitherto prevented me from

giving greater publicity to those facts. In the course of the present summer
my attention has been directed to apply similar means to the detection of
metallic poisons, a subject of acknowledged and increasing importance ; and
the results I have obtained, and now beg leaye to submit to the Society, appear
to me both noyel and interesting, and afford, if I mistake not, means more
simple, delicate, and effectual, than any at present known for detecting the
common metallic poisons.

The fear of trespassing too much on the time of the Society, induces me to
limit the present paper to one part only of the subject. At no distant period
I promise myself the pleasure of communicating the remaining part, which
will embrace the different electro-chemical experiments I have made on the
other metals and their compounds, together with the application of the facts
