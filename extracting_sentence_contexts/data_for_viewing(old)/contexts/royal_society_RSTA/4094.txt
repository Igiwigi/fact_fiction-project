the electric field created by each particle in the non-polar fluid has a dipolar character, as shown
in figure 3a. Asymptotically, the electric field of each particle is equivalent to the field of a dipole
of effective dipole moment pg, which is oriented perpendicular to the liquid interface. The force
of electrostatic repulsion between two such dipoles is [4,26,27]

The factor 2 in the denominator of equation (3.1) accounts for the fact that the dipolar field
occupies only the upper half-space (the non-polar fluid), whereas the electric field in the aqueous
phase is screened by the ions in water; r¢ is the contact-line radius.

In the case of an electric field created by charges at the particle/non-polar fluid interface
(figure 3b), the electrostatic boundary problem has been solved in bispherical coordinates using
the Mehler-Fock integral transform and the following expression for pg has been derived [28]:

Pa= 4a D(4, pn) Rp sin? 0. (3.2)

Here, 6 is the contact angle (figure 3b); o is the electric charge density at the particle/non-polar
fluid interface; D=D6(6, pn) is a known dimensionless function, which can be calculated by
means of table 1 and eqn (D.1) in [28]; and epn = &p/én is the ratio of the dielectric constants
