We should find that
among the bases the lime was prevailing, and next to it the magnesia, next to it the
Soda, the iron, the manganese, the alumina, and potash. Of acids the carbonic would
be prevailing, and next to it the sulphuric, the muriatic (chlorine), and the silicic. Now all these substances are found in sea-water, but the proportions are quite different.

* The potash which T have mentioned here represents in fact not the mean of all the observations in the
great ocean, but only the mean of a number of determinations for the northern part of the Atlantic, my older
observations on the quantity of potash in the other parts of the ocean being not exact enough. This quantity
of potash differs most probably very little from the real mean. MDCCCLXV.
