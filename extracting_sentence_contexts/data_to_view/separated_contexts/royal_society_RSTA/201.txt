Most of the discussion will focus on a certain
class of these particles, but the goal has a broader aim. In a sense single molecule
studies although now widespread are still in an early stage. Even for the most
widely studied system, CdSe nanoparticles, new facts are being discovered while
we write. Not only is the theoretical picture incomplete but also the experimental
one on which competing theories are based. What we learn from studies of this
particular group of systems can in some measure provide a base not only for
suggesting new experiments but also for developing theoretical ideas on new
systems in the single molecule field as a whole.
