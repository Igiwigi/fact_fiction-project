These results bring out the fact that although striking effects on crystal growth are
obtained from solutions containing extremely small concentrations of Calgon, the con-
centration of additive in the solid is appreciable. The distribution of Calgon between the
solution and the growing solid appears to show a high degree of adsorption which is
followed by trapping of the additive.

(e) Effect of Calgon in the absence of spherical seed grains

(i) At 21Â° C. The observation that seed grains grew but little when more than about
1-5 p.p.m. of P,O; (as Calgon) was present led to tests being done in the absence of grains.
