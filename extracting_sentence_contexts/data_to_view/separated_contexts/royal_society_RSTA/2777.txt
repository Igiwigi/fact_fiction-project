Mobility of the lithosphere
may be slow compared with typical fluid velocities in the mantle interior (a ‘sluggish lid’
regime), exhibit varying degrees of episodicity or fail to produce truly rigid plates. But as long as
subduction of surface material that drives surface motion takes place, convection is in the mobile
lid regime. In fact, forming genuinely plate-like behaviour is still a challenge today, as models
typically fail to form strike-slip faults, truly rigid plates or single-sided subduction [55], though
some of these features can be created in select cases (e.g. [56,57]). As a result, I will focus on the
‘mobile lid’ regime (rather than the ‘plate-tectonic’ regime) in contrast to the stagnant lid regime
in this paper. Although nonlinear rheologies can generate mobile lid convection, the mechanism (or
mechanisms) behind such rheological behaviour are still not well understood (e.g. [55]).
