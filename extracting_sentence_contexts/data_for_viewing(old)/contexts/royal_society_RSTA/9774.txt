Iremind the reader that the determination of the generating function, when the
part magnitude is unrestricted, depends upon the determination of the associated
lattice function (see Art. 5, loc. cit.). This function is assumed to be the product of
an expression of known form and of another function which I termed the inner lattice
function (see Art. 10, loc. cit.), and it is on the form of this function that the interest
of the investigation in large measure depends. All that is known about it @ priori
is its numerical value when x is put equal to unity (Art. 10, Joe. cét.). The lattice
function was also exhibited as a sum of sub-lattice functions, and it was shown that
the generating function, when the part magnitude is restricted, may be expressed as
a linear function of them. These sub-lattice functions are intrinsically interesting,
but it will be shown in what follows that they are not of vital importance to the
investigation. In fact, the difficulty of constructing them has been turned by the

formation and solution of certain functional equations which lead in the first place
to the required generating functions, and in the second place to an exhibition of the
forms of the sub-lattice functions. To previous definitions I here add the definition
of the inner lattice function when there is a restriction upon the part magnitude, and
it will be shown that the generating, lattice, and inner lattice functions satisfy
