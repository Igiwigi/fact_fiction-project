in velocity, respectively, it can be regarded as an intermediate between them. We call (2.2a) the
Signorini contact condition of dynamic type (hereinafter, referred to as SCD condition). With the SCD
and Tresca friction conditions, we prove unique existence of a strong solution for the linearized
elastodyanmic equations, thus having properties (i) and (ii). Moreover, property (iii) is also
approached by our model because 6 > 0 can be fixed to an arbitrarily small value (however it
is not possible to make exactly 5 = 0).

An expository interpretation of our result may be that making the Signorini contact condition
in displacement ‘dynamic a bit’ (recall that boundary conditions having quantities with time
derivative are called dynamic) leads to some stabilization effect to the system. We expect that


this fact has some connection with Baumgarte-like stabilization techniques known in numerical
simulations of non-smooth mechanics (see [17]), which is to be investigated in the future. The
present result will also be of basic interest when we make an attempt to more involved crack
problems, e.g. propagation and singular behaviour of crack tips.

This paper is organized as follows. In §2, we introduce notation and the precise mathematical
setting to be studied. In §3, a variational inequality formulation as well as the definition of a
strong solution is introduced, and we present the main theorem. Section 4 is devoted to its proof
based on regularization of a variational inequality and Galerkin’s method. The strategy basically
follows our previous study [15]; nevertheless, the analysis, in particular a priori estimates and a
uniqueness proof, becomes more intricate to deal with the contact condition.
