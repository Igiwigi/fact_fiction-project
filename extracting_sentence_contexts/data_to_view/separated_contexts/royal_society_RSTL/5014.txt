yet s0 obscure, shonld not be altogether overlooked. As the snn must be recognised
as at least the primary source of all magnetic variations which conform to a law of
local hours, it seems not unreasonable that in the case of other variations also, whether
of irregular occurrence or of longer period, we should look in the first instance to any
periodical variation by which we may learn that the sun is affected, to see whether
any coincidence of period or epoch is traceable. Now the facts of the solar spots, as
they have been recently made known to us by the assiduous and systematic labours
of ScuwaBE, present us with phenomena which appear to indicate the existence of
some periodical affection of an outer envelope, (the photosphere,) of the sun ; and it is
certainly a most striking coincidence, that the period, and the epochs of minima and
maxima, which M. Scawase has assigned to the variation of the solar spots, are abs0-
lately identical with those which have been here assigned to the magnetic variations. In the third volume of Kosmos, page 402 (Englisb translation, vol. iii.
