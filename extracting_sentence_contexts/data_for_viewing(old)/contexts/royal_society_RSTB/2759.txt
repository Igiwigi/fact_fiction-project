be doubted, and the Black-faced sheep and the Merinos in different parts of Scotland
and Cape Colony respectively furnish direct evidence that this is the case. On the
other hand, there can be no doubt that the varying degrees of breeding activity are
also in part racial characteristics, as is shown, for example, by the Dorset Horn sheep
of the south of England, and more evidently by the Limestone sheep of Westmoreland
and Derbyshire. But that an increase in the duration (or more frequent recurrence)
of the sexual season is not necessarily a highly artificial condition or the part result
of special attention in regard to food supply, &c., on the part of the flockmaster, is
shown by such a condition occurring normally among the half-wild sheep of Patani.

* From Hxaprâ€™s notes (1900) on the subject it would seem possible that goats and pigs could be made
to illustrate a similar gradation from the moncestrous habit in the natural state to varying degrees of
polyeestrum, under domestication or in captivity, but the facts about these animals are less perfectly
known,

The Scotch Black-faced sheep, further afford evidence that where the number of
recurrent cestrous periods is increased (beyond the normal number in the home of the
breed in question, e.g., the Highlands, in the case of the Black-faced sheep) the
duration of the cestrus is shorter,* while, whether partly or entirely as a consequence
of this latter fact, the length of the dicestrous cycle is also less.+
