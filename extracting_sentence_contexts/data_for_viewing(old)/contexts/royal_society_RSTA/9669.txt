months, a high value in the maximum for the subsequent pulse is in considerable
measure accidental, but even if accepted as a physical fact, it might have more than
one interpretation.

When we took from amongst the selected disturbed days those whose “ character ”
figure exceeded 1°5, the amplitude of the associated pulse was decidedly larger than
that associated with the full choice of 5 days a month. Consequently, the amplitude
of the subsequent pulse increases with that of the primary pulse. Thus a large
maximum in columns 3 to 8, or 9 to 14, of Table VIIT. is naturally regarded as due
at least in part to a large corresponding value in columns 1 or 2. But it might also
arise from a greater potency of the 27-day period at one season of the year than
another, or simply from a large average amount of disturbance during the month in
which the subsequent pulse falls. If the principal cause of a large amplitude in the
subsequent pulse is large amplitude in the primary, then, apart from accident, one
