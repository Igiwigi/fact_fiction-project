In 8upport of the first view the following points have been urged :—

(«.) The rotation of the plane of polarised light is supposed to point to molecular
grouping in liquids and solids, which does not exist in gases.
(b.) The existence of allotropic forms of elements, and of isomorphous forms of

compounds, and the fact that heat is evolved or absorbed during paszage
from the one form to the other.

(e.) The abnormal vapour-density of sulphur and selenium among elements, and of
the compound nitric peroxide appear to be undoubtedly due to the existence
of complex molecules. It is to be remarked that in these cases molecular
grouping oceurs before the liquid condition is attained.

(4.) The abnormal yapour-densities of all substances at temperatures near their
boiling-points, shown especially by acetic and homologous acids. Here also
the grouping, if any, mus occur in the gaseous state.
