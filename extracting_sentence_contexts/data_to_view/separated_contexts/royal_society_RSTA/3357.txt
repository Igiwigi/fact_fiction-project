Here, ¢jo, dt « are fermionic operators satisfying the usual anticommutation relations, Nig =
dt ofjo, t>0 is the hopping parameter and U > 0 is the strength of the on-site repulsion. The
outline of this paper is as follows. In §2, we briefly recall necessary facts from the exact solution
of the Hubbard model. In §3, we consider typical states at finite temperature. In §§4 and 5, we
employ methods of integrability to show that it is possible to construct particular eigenstates at
finite energy densities for which the charge degrees of freedom do not contribute to the volume
term in the bipartite EE, corroborating the notion of the QDL diagnostic proposed in [33].
