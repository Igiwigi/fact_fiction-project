specks of extravasation, from some of the horizontal canals
bursting through the pellicle.*

The changes just mentioned seemed to occur in a regular
order of succession. First, the pellicle was formed 6n the
surface. Secondly, the bubbles of gas made their appearance.
Thirdly, the canals carrying red blood were observed :
these, while filled with carbonic acid gas, were not to be
distinguighed from the semi-transparent jelly which sur-
rounded them.

As it is difficult to describe appearances of this kind, and
it is of importance that the fact of such appearances being
met with, should be well established, I requested Mr. Bauer
to make a drawing of a portion of the sore of which I have
attempted a description, after it had been exposed for nearly
Sixteen minutes ; and on the following day he made a draw-
ing of the same portion, showing the progress that had been
made, and that the canals formed on the first day, had on the
second become permanent tubes, and had been covered over
by a cuticle. These two drawings are annexed.

* If, under these circumstances, the foot was put to the ground, 5o weak was the
covering of the canals, that it instantly gave way, and the sore was covered with
