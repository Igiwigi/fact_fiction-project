a minute quantity in the viscid fluid lubricating the tongue,
and also in the urine, and even in the blood.

Reflecting on the use which this fluid may be of to the
toad, it has occurred to me that it may answer two purposes,
and these of importance to this abhorred but innocent
reptile.

As the external surface of the skin is smeared with this
«© '$weltered venom ** (the very appropriate epithet given it
by our great dramatic poet), it must serve to. defend it
against the attacks of carnivorous animals: © a toad to eat”
is a proverbial expression well known; and the facts adduced
show its propriety and force. I may here add, that nature
has given this animal an additional security against attack, in
providing it with integuments of great thickness, and strength,
