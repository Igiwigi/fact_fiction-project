Read February 28, 18292. Ar a time when geology is pursued with s0 much ardour,
I am induced to lay before the Society the following facts re-
specting the skull and teeth of the seal, as their being known
will be an advantage when incrusted or fossil remains of that
animal are met with. The accompanying drawings were made go years ago, at the
time Mr. HUNTER was preparing to lay before the Society some
observations on the skulls of wolves and bears found in the
caves of the principality of Bayreuth, in Germany. Among
these, so great was the difference in the form of the skull of
the young bear and the old, that where the jaws had been
destroyed, it required the eye of an anatomist to determine
that the skull really belonged to the bear.
