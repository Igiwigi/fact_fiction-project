cium. When the apparatus had been completely filled with hydrogen, the tube con-
taining the oxide of palladium was heated by means of charcoal. Water was evolved
and the metal reduced. The current of gas was continued until all water had been
carried into the chloride of calcium tube, and the weights were then determined.
It was found that from 45687 grains of the hydrated oxide, there were obtained
33-532 grains of metal, and 11:298 grains of water, giving 73:95 for the former,
and 24:74 for the latter per cent., but of this 24-74, there were formed 12:49 by means
of 11-10 of oxygen which had been combined with the metal, and the water of hydra-
tion amounted therefore to but 12:25 per cent.

The difference between the total yolatile matter and the water (317 per cent.),
may be certainly considered as carbonic acid, from the circumstances under which
the substance is prepared, and from the fact that it in all cases effervesces slightly
when dissolved in muriatic acid.

We may sum up, therefore, the composition of this true basic carbonate of palla-
dium as follows :â€”
