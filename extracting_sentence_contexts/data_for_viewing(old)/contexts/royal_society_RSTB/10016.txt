lectual tool if not a cosmogenic obsession. Zeno cantered the
natural philosophy of Stoicism around the doctrine of an
essential fire. A Greek successor, Diogenes Laertius,
summed up Nature as ‘an artistically working fire’, a

phrase Cicero repeats in De Natura Deorum and a metaphor
undoubtedly derived from the authority of pyrotechnologies.
(It was Cicero who famously observed that, by their artifice,
humans had transmuted raw nature into a ‘second nature’.
Pliny the Elder showed how: ‘At the conclusion of our
survey of the ways in which human intelligence calls art to
its aid in counterfeiting nature, we cannot but marvel at the
fact that fire is necessary for almost every operation’. Fire
transformed clay into brick, limestone into cement, ore into
metal, sand into glass—and on and on.) As fire animated

The majority of philosophers followed the example of
Empedocles, who orchestrated the competing principles of
the Ionians into four elements (or ‘permanent roots’)—
earth, air, water and fire. The Pythagoreans placed a ‘central
fire’ (different from the sun) in the middle, while around it
