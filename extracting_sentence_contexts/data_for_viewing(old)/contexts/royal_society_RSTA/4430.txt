photosynthesis’ is an exciting and extremely promising long-term research area. In the meantime,
there might also be an opportunity for a technological shortcut [1]. Reduction equivalents can be
produced in the form of H2 by water electrolysis with established and scalable technologies using
renewable primary energy sources such as wind, photovoltaics or water. Coupling the generated
‘carbon-free’ (better: low-carbon) hydrogen with CO) via selective catalytic transformation opens
up the possibility for energy storage systems, moving up and down the oxidation level of the
Cl products [2,3]. At the same time, there are entries into the chemical value chain at each
oxidation state of carbon, if additional bonds are formed in the catalytic process. Thus, the
CO2/H2 couple can be used as a Cl synthon, allowing for sustainable processes across the
chemical value chain [4]. Most significantly, this can open up novel synthetic pathways following
the green chemistry principles even in conventional Hz sources [5]. Thus, the development of
such a catalytic process does not require renewable energy sources as a necessary prerequisite to
be implemented, but may in fact facilitate their introduction by providing additional economic
outlets for the system-inherent overcapacities.


2. Recent progress and illustrative examples

The reduction sequence of CO2 by Hz addition and H2O elimination can follow two distinct
mechanistic principles. Firstly, the reverse water gas shift reaction (rWGS) can convert carbon
dioxide and hydrogen to carbon monoxide and water. As long as there is still Hz present,
this generates in situ the mixture CO/H2 known as ‘syngas’, a versatile starting material for
carbonylation and reductive carbonylation processes. Alternatively, the reduction occurs by
stepwise transfer of hydrides and protons onto the CO? unit, working its way through the
formate, formaldehyde, methoxy and methyl stages. In either case, the formal reduction can lead
