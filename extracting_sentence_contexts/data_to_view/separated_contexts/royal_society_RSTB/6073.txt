At the caudal border of the “ pulvinar,” and in the course of the optic tract, is
a fusiform swelling, the lateral geniculate body. This was present on both sides of the
diencephalon in the six Echidna brains examined, and was described by ZIEHEN
(1897, a). That it is not always present in Echidna is shown by the fact that it was
absent from the brain-stem described by Extior Smrru (1902). It is small, in
keeping with the size of the optic tract, and is continued dorsally in the superior
brachium. Medial to the lateral geniculate body, and rather more caudally, is a
low swelling over the anterior end of the inferior brachium and the lateral border
of the cerebral peduncle, fig.
