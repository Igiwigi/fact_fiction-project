We are now in a position to review the facts detailed above, and to examine into
their real value.

I. Condition of the Animal.

(a) Health.—It had been in England about two months, and appeared to be in
perfect health, and although the day before the experiment its appetite had begun to
fail a little, to all appearances it was vigorous and healthy. It moved about in the
vertical posture, and all its acts were per ormed completely, and with the deliberation
special to the Orang.

(b) Age.—The animal was estimated to be about 2} years old. Since the animal
was a young one, we wish it to be understood clearly that the facts which we put
forward concerning the limitation of representation are not necessarily typical, as it is
possible that this may be more extensive in an older animal. Bearing on this point
we may mention that we have found that, given the same species of Macacque
Monkey, a more extensive representation occurs with a larger, 7.¢., an older, brain,
and the converse also holds, but that the chief details and general plan are the same
under the two circumstances.

Future investigation can alone decide this point.

II. Vertical arrangement of the Representation of each Segment in levels
transverse to the Fissure of RoLaANno.
