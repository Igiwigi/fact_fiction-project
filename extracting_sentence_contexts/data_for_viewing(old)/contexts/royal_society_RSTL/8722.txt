In the eaxe 74. 5 +$<L the inferior limit being then 0, this is in fact Jacopr's

theorem (Crelle, t. xii. p. 69, 1834); but Jacopr does not consider the general case where
L is not =0, nor does he give PRE the formula in the other case

Fe &2

150. Suppose k=0, e being in the first instance not =0, then the former alternative
holds good ; and observing, in regard to the form which contains +w in the denomi-
nator, that we can now take account of the two values by simply multiplying by 2, we
have
