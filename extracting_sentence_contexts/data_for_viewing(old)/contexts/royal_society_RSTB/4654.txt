It is worthy of note that these comparisons are with the structure of the adult
Flat-fishes. That is, the authors assumed that the extensive differences in structure
in the order of Flat-fishes have arisen after the asymmetry and demersal habitat had
been obtained. This does not seem a reasonable assumption ; it would mean that the
same parallel changes in fundamental structure can take place in two different media,
in passive, asymmetrical, demersal fishes as in active, normal, pelagic fishes.

The distinctive characters of Psettodes are: (1) spinous rays in fins; (2) supra-
maxillary ; (3) toothed palatines ; (4) two post-cleithra on each side.

These are advanced Teleostean characters, however, found in no other Flat-fish.
And, as a matter of fact, Psettodes stands quite isolated, not merely as a separate
genus or family, but even as a separate sub-order ; yet only one species is known.

Psettodes also possesses primitive characters: (1) dimorphism of optic chiasma ;
(2) urohyal a simple plate; (3) no abdominal balancing rod; (4) tri-segmented
radialia posteriorly.

The combination of primitive body characters with advanced head characters is
not very remarkable; the connecting links are the postcleithra and spinous rays
anteriorly (also articulation of urohyal with basibranchial). The vertical balance has
