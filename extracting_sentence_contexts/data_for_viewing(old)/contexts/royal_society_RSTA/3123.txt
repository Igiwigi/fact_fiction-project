SO (Po, 4a) is indeed a canonical pair as claimed. Finally, because the means are zero

E[Po qo] = @7E[PFockIFock] + B?E[Prock4Fock] = (@* — B?)E[Prock4Fock] = —i

and similarly E[qo po] =i.

What does it mean to say that the sequence of canonical pairs (4.2) converges in distribution
to (Po, 4a)? The simplest notion of convergence is that of distribution operators in the Hilbert—
Schmidt norm. This would correspond to convergence in the L? sense of the densities of joint

1n fact their Wigner densities are everywhere non-negative for even n, as may be seen using multiplicative properties of the
corresponding quasi-characteristic functions.


distributions to the corresponding Gaussian density, in contrast with the ‘weak convergence’ in
the probabilistic sense [10] of the two-dimensional classical central limit theorem. But it can be
shown that [11] in the quantum case convergence is in the stronger sense, for an arbitrary bounded

As bounded operators are non-commutative ‘bounded measurable functions’, our quantum
central limit theorem, in which convergence is in the sense of expectations of such ‘functions’, is
