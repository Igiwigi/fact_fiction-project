He thought that it may be possible to represent the ultimate reality responsible for quantum
phenomena (and hence what happens between quantum experiments) by means of mathematics
apart from ordinary language or concepts, or even physical concepts, at least as the latter are
conventionally understood, say, in classical physics or relativity, while arguing that our language
and concepts could only apply, at the level of observation, to quantum phenomena [7] (pp.
145-189). Nor, in RWR interpretations, does QM represent quantum phenomena themselves, which
are represented by classical physics, the assumption central for Bohr and to be designated as
the Bohr postulate, thus completing the trio of the main postulates assumed in this article—
the Heisenberg, Bohr and Dirac postulates. In fact, there is a quartet of postulates governing
this article if one adds Born’s rule, which is in effect the postulate, necessary to connect, in the
way explained below, the formalism to the outcomes of measurements (classical by the Bohr
postulate) in terms of probabilities. QM only predicts, in general probabilistically, the outcomes
of quantum experiments, registered classically, and to do so it requires Born’s rule. No other
predictions are, again, possible on experimental grounds, because the repetition of the identically
prepared quantum experiments in general leads to different outcomes.
