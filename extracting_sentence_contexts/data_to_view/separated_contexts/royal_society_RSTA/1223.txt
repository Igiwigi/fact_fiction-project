The papers [26,27] extend the result just described to the case where there are two thin layers Lo |
lying on two sides of a semi-permeable membrane. The role of boundary conditions is then played

by various sorts of transmission conditions, but the effect is the same: transmission conditions 13
become integral parts of the limit master equation, and describe jumps of a limit process from 1S
one side of the membrane to the other. The fact that the same biological phenomenon, depending : gS
on ‘geometry’, may be described by a boundary /transmission condition or a term in the master 13

equation is thoroughly discussed, and connections to the underlying, so-called Lévy local time of
stochastic process are drawn.

7. An introduction to asymptotic stability: the Perron—Frobenius theorem

Let us turn to the question of asymptotic stability: a good starting point is a continuous version of : Fd
the classical Perron—Frobenius theorem. To recall it, let X be the space R” with the scalar product if
(-,-).
