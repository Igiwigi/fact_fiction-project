So far we have applied only qualitative tests. Quantitative tests are postponed to
the third chapter. [5] Plate cut parallel to the face of an octahedron—We start with the experimental
fact :—‘‘ The amplitude of the waves of S$, reaches a small maximum in small fields
and vanishes in stronger fields almost completely.” * It will be shown now that the
present theory bears out this result. The eight faces of an octahedron formed from a cubic structure have for their normals
(41/V3, £1//3, + 1/173) as direction cosines.
