and fall, and they are all fairly symmetrical with reference to the ordinate for noon.
The summer curve has two well-marked maxima, with a secondary minimum near
noon ; even in the equinox the depression near noon is distinctly visible.

The amplitude of the diurnal inequality varies so much that it is difficult to
recognise the difference in type between curves for the different seasons when drawn
on the same scale. Fig. 4 shows the inequalities for the three seasons on different

scales, so related that the mean of the 24-hourly ordinates is the same for each.
This brings out very clearly the fact that the difference in type is mainly between
7 pm. and 9 am., ze. during the hours when the diurnal movement is least

conspicuous.
