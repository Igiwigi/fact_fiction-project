north curve; the winter half-yearly south curve scarcely deserves the name of 8uch,
the winter half-yearly north curve exhibits the oscillations in a far higher de:
although they are still somewhat irregular. The doubt s0 often raised, whether during the winter season any lunar-diurnal
variation was traceable at all, can, I think, not be entertained any longer, if we pay due
attention to the facts which may be gleaned from our Table. Indeed we shall presently
see, when speaking of the lunar-diurnal variation in the various years of observation,
that in some cases the variation manifests itself in a very distinct manner even during
those months when the sun's declination is north. l

The principal features of the curves just enumerated may be delineated as follows:â€”
