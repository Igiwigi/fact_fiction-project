One may imagine a number of such lower-dimensional universes coexisting in the
parent space and moving in one or more of the extra dimensions. Using the mathematics of
submanifolds, it is not very difficult to describe the geometric properties of this set-up as well
as the modified Einstein equations, cf. [109,110]. In fact, there are several scenarios in the literature about possible brane models of the early
universe, a particularly interesting one being the ekpyrotic universe proposed in 2001 by Khoury
et al. [111] (see [112] for a review with many references). Here, two parallel branes approach
each other, collide, and then rebound, moving in one of the spatial dimensions available. The big
bang occurs as a bounce periodically an infinite number of times, each time there is a collision,
and then there is a cyclic process of contraction, bounce and expansion, like in the old Tolman
oscillating universe.
