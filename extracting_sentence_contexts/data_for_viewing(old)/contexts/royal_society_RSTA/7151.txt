Hall’s group-theoretical proof (here reproduced) is replaced by a purely set-theoretical one.

Theorem (17-1) now follows if G is first replaced by K and then lemma (18-1) is applied.
A further result is obtained from this proof:

Corotiary. Lf A and B are isomorphic subgroups of a finite group G, then they are conjugate in
a finite supergroup H of G. (18-3)

19. Miscellaneous applications

For the purpose of corollary (18-3), H can be chosen as the symmetric group of all per-
mutations of the elements of G. Then the order of H is bounded in terms of that of G. More
important is the fact that H then depends on G only, not on A and B; that is, H serves
simultaneously for all pairs of isomorphic subgroups of G which one may wish to make
conjugate. This is also true for infinite groups G if one takes H to be, for example, the
unrestricted symmetric group of all permutations of the elements of K = GG’, where
G’ is isomorphic to G. This, and a little more, we also obtain from the following theorem:

Tueorem (Higman, Neumann & Neumann 1949). Let G be a group and let there be given, to
every suffix x in a suitable set A, an isomorphism ¢,, of a subgroup A, of Gon toa subgroup B, of G.
Then there is a group H which contains G as well as a free group T with free generators t,(ae A) such
that transformation by t,, maps every element a,¢ A, on to the corresponding element a, $,€B,: (19-1)

tz dt, = 4,9, (ae A, ae A,). (19-2)
