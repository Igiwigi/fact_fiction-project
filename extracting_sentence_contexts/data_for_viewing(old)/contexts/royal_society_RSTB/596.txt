The peculiar arrangement of the cingulum in the gyrus fornicatus is of especial
interest, when considered with the fact found out by Professors Horstey and
ScHArer,* that whereas the marginal convolution was excitable, no movement was
produced when the gyrus fornicatus was stimulated electrically, and moreover that
loss of sensation on the opposite part of the body was produced in Monkeys when
parts of this convolution were removed, thus showing that it was associated with the
function of sensation. It is here suggested that in the Marmoset the cingulum may
form internuncial fibres between the gyrus fornicatus—the sensory part of the
cortex —and the part of the centrum ovale in connection with the so-called motor
cortex. q

Calearine Fibres.—In describing the cingulum frequent allusion has been made to
a system of fibres which I have called calcarine, from the fact that they are found in
that part of the cortex which is involuted to form the calcarine fissure.

In all the different planes (especially sagittal and horizontal) great difficulty was

found (figs. 5, 22, 28, Cing. p., Cf.) at the junction of its horizontal and posterior parts
to find the limit of the cingulum in the posterior direction. It was seen to be merged
into a set of fibres which could be traced into the occipital region along the most
