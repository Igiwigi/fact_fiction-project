It seems to me to be im-
portant to ascertain, by accurate experiments, whether, under the circumstances last
mentioned, nitric acid or nitrates are formed. Some observations made by Bra-
coNnNoT and SAUSSURE 8eem to speak in favour of such a formation, they are however
too vague to decide the question. To arrive at certainty regarding that fact is im-
portant, not only with respect to the theory of spontaneous nitrification, but also
with reference to a matter which has of late been the subject of much discussion:


PROFESSOR SCHOENBEIN ON SPONTANEOUS NITRIFICATION. 141

From what source does the vegetable world draw the nitrogen which we meet in 80
many of her products? Tf, according to a prevailing notion, it be only nitrogen in a
compound state that can be assimilated by plants, is it not possible that nitrogen
contained in nitrates might be as well taken up by them as the azote of ammonia ?
