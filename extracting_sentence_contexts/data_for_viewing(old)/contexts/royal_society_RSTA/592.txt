calibrating the nonlinear terms of the model.

The procedure adopted for the calibration of the model, and in particular obtaining the
supply and demand functions, is based on the assumption that all the information about
the behaviour of the commodities is contained in the observed market prices. This is quite unlike
the procedure adopted in [3], where a large collection of macroeconomic data such as interest
rates, unemployment, inflation and so on was required to estimate the supply and demand
function. The approach adopted is also quite distinct from the auto-regression moving average
(ARMA) [8].

In the statistical microeconomics approach [1], an action functional (as well as the Lagrangian)—
consisting of the sum of a kinetic and a potential term—is postulated to exist in the market.
The most important result of [2] is that an action functional does in fact exist in the market; the
existence of the action functional for multiple commodities has been empirically verified in [4].
Hence, for both single and multiple commodities, the formulation of statistical microeconomics
finds clear support from market prices. The microeconomic Lagrangian provides a self-contained
and comprehensive framework for the study of microeconomics. In particular, one can now
investigate what are the underlying theoretical principles of microeconomics that would give
rise to an action functional formulation of statistical microeconomics.
