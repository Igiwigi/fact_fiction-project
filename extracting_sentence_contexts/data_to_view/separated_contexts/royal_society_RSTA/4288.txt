The nuclei produced by the action of ultra-violet light differ in many ways from
‘sthose produced by X-rays or Uranium rays. The expansion required to make water condense upon them depends on the strength
Yof the radiation, and when this is strong, only a very slight expansion is necessary, as is
Zshown in Experiments (1) and (29) in the above table. The smallest expansion of
B which the apparatus admitted was, in fact, sufficient to form a fog with strong
radiation, and indeed, in later experiments, fogs were obtained without any expansion. 2Under the action of the weakest rays used, however (Expts. 30-39), the expansion
“required to obtain condensation is as great (p = about 150 millims.) as that required
&to catch the nuclei produced by X-rays.
