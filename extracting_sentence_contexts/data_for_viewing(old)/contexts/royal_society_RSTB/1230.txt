on Phylloglossum, viz., that “it is a permanently embryonic form of Lycope
fact, as he states,* Phylloglossum “ would represent a more ancient group
represented by living Lycopodiums.”

This view, however, is not universally admitted. M. Brerrranp, while reeg 9
the similarity between the early stages of Lycopodium cernuum and the
Phylloglossum, remarks “It is singular, in the present case, that Phyllogle
superior to the Lycopods, and still that its adult state is but a reproduction’
embryonic stage of the latter. Here is a case of retrogression, which has as its
cause the semi-aquatic habit.” I confess, with all respect to M. Berrrayp,
the anatomical characters on which he chiefly relies for assigning relative po
to the Lycopods do not seem to me a sufficient reason for placing Phayllogh
higher in the scale than Lycopodium. As to the semi-aquatic habit, it seems
that it is precisely in such positions that the most interesting early forms ¢
