In the lower tribes of animals, and in the entire vegetable king-
dom, we trace this dependence in the precise relation between the vital activity of each
individual, and the amount of heat which it receives from external sources. Every spe-
cies is adapted to flourish within a certain range of temperature; and that amount
of heat which is most effective in sustaining the life of one species, may be injurious
or even fatal to another. But within the range which is compatible with the mani-
festation of its vital powers, we find that the relation is most constant between the
temperature and the organizing force exhibited by each species, It is scarcely neces-
sary to accumulate facts in support of a position s0 generally admitted ; but the

author particularly wishes to direct attention to the definiteness and exactness of this
relation, and may instance the following facts as examples. 1. According to BoussIxGaurr, the same annual plant, in arriving at its full de-
