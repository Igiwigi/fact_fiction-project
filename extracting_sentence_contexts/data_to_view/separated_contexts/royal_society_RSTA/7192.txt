For this purpose we can note first that for incompressible flow,
as assumed in the asymptotic solution, the pressure gradient through the slit is given by

Q(2)

WH) = 7 Ty) te
for any time ¢. This equation corresponds to a constant shape for the distribution of y over
the slit, whereas in the pulse problem the distribution of ¥ will undoubtedly vary with time. However, for the particular instant ¢ = 1, it is easy to show from equations (49) and (50)
that + is in fact also given in the pulse problem by equation (96) but with Q(t) = 1. Hence at the instant ¢=1 the percentage agreement between exact and asymptotic
solutions is the same for all individual values of y as for Q(t), namely, about 3%. Since
thereafter the values for Q(é) in table 7 show a general increase of agreement with increasing
