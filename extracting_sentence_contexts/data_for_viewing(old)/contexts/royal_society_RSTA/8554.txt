The arbitrary constant is determined by the fact that at the beginning of the flight

Since we reckon ¢ and s to be zero at the vertex, this value of @ occurs when ¢ = —a,
where a is the time of ascent, and when s = —1, where / is the maximum height attained.

When the arbitrary constant has been removed from (15) in this way, we obtain

Integrating once more we get the displacement of the sphere relative to the ground in
