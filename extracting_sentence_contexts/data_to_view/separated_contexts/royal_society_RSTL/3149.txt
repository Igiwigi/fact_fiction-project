We may also in fig. 17, supposing B charged and A neutral, examine the reflected in-
duction by withdrawing A and the false end Ã¾ simultaneously, and finally estimating by
the electrometer disc m, the proportion of the whole charge abstracted by the influence
of A at different distances. We may, in fact, obtain any required complicated me-
chanical arrangement peculiar to this kind of research, and arrive at a very complete
experimental analysis of the reciprocal inductive action between the two opposed
bodies, under a variety of new conditions *.

Exp. 27. The body A, fig. 16, being charged with a given quantity and placed
within *2 distance of B, the force upon the electrometer dise amounted to 20*; the
distance m2 F, of the latter being *5 of an inch.
