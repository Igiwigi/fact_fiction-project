After one doubling


26 MR. G. UDNY YULE ON A MATHEMATICAL THEORY OF EVOLUTION,

interval the frequencies should be proportional to 3, 4, 4, 4, and so on, the common
ratio being 4: after two doubling-periods the series should be }, #, Â¢, and so on, the
common ratio being ; if @ is the first term of the series the common ratio must be
(1-a) to make the sum of the series unity. Clearly we are not in a position to compare
this deduction with the facts, for we cannot pick out any group of genera, let alone a
group of similar genera, which are all precisely of the same age. We have, therefore, to proceed to the much more general problem. In the above,
generic mutations are ignored, attention being fixed on the primordial genera alone.
