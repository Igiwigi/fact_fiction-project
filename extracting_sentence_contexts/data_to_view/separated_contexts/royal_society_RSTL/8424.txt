The facts will then tell their own tale ; the
conditions under which they invariably occur will give the laws; and the theory will
follow without much difficulty. In the eloquent words of Sir Huxeary Davy, © When
I consider the yariety of theories which may be formed on the slender foundation of
one or two facts, I am convinced that it is the business of the true philosopher to avoid
them altogether. It is more laborious to accumulate facts than to reason concerning

them; but one good experiment is of more yalue than the ingenuity of a brain like
Newrox's.”
