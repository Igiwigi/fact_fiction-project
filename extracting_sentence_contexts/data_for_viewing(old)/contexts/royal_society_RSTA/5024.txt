If we thus consider a smooth laminar flow with a fixed, finite value of ||Vull, then (r2(t)) > 0 as
2. 0. Under such an assumption, magnetic field lines do not diffuse a far distance away from the
solution of the deterministic ordinary differential equation dx/dt = u(x, t), and the magnetic line
diffusion becomes a negligible effect. In that case, magnetic flux is conserved better as 4 decreases.
However, in a turbulent flow, the above argument fails! The inequality (7.1) still holds, of
course, but it no longer restricts the dispersion of field lines under the joint action of resistivity
and advection. As is well known, a longer and longer inertial range of power-law spectrum
E(k) occurs as viscosity v decreases and the maximum velocity gradient ||Vu|| becomes larger
and larger. In fact, energy dissipation ¢ = v||Vul|* is observed to be non-vanishing as v > 0 in
turbulent flow, requiring velocity gradients to grow unboundedly. Estimating ||Vul] ~ (e/v)!/2,
the upper bound (7.1) becomes

(P(t) < 6a y" [ew (2 ()'") - | . (7.2)

This bound allows unlimited diffusion of field lines. Consider first the case 4 =v or Pt =1, for
simplicity, where Richardson’s theory implies that

(r7(t)) ~ 12at + ef. (7.3)

The rigorous upper bound always lies strictly above Richardson’s prediction and, in fact, goes
to infinity as v = — 0! The case of large Prandtl number is just slightly more complicated, as
