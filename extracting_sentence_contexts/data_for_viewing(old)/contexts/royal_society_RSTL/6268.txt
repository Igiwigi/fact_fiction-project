the order (4—1) is known, we can, by combining it with the equation for the squares of
the roots, form the equation of differences for the given equation with the constant term
put equal to zero, and thence by the above-mentioned property of the Seminvariancy of
the coefficients, find the equation of differences for the given equation. The present
memoir shows the application of the process to equations of the orders two, three, four,
and five: part of the calculation for the equation of the fifth order was kindly performed
for me by the Rev. R. HarLey. It is to be noticed that the best course is to apply the
method in the first instance to the forms (a, b, .. Cv, 1)"=0, without numerical coeffi-
cients (or, as they may be termed, the denumerate forms), and to pass from the results
s0 obtained to those which belong to the forms (a, 6, ..Xv, 1)*=0, or standard forms.
The equation of differences, for (4—P)?, &c., the coefficients of which are seminyariants,
naturally leads to the consideration of a more general equation having for its roots
(4—PY (x—7y) (x—3yY, &e., the coefficients of which are covariants; and in fact,
when, as for equations of the orders two, three, and four, all the covariants are known,
such covariant equation can be at once formed from the equation of differences ; for
equations of the fifth order, however, where the covariants are not calculated beyond a
certain degree, only a few of the coefficients of the covariant equation can be thus at
once formed. At the conclusion of the memoir, I show how the equation of differences
for an equation of the order # can be obtained by the elimination of a single quantity
from two equations each of the order n—1; and by applying to these two equations the
simplification which I have made in Brzourt's abridged method of elimination, I exhibit
the equation of differences for the given equation of the order 7, in a compendious form
by means of a determinant ; the first-mentioned method is, however, that which is
best adapted for the actual development of the equation of differences for the equation
of a given order.
