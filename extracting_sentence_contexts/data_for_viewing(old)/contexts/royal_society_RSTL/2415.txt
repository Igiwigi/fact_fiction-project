and the numbers representing the proportions in which they are eyolved electro-
chemical equivalents. Thus hydrogen, oxygen, chlorine, iodine, lead, tin, are tons ;
the three former are anions, the two metals are cations, and 1, 8, 36, 125, 104, 58, are
their electro-chemical equivalents nearly.

825. A summary of certain points already ascertained respecting electrolytes, ions.
and electro-chemical equivalents, may be given in the following general form of pro-
positions, without, I hope, including any serious error.

826. 1. A single ton, i. e. one not in combination with another, will have no ten-
deney to pass to either of the electrodes, and will be perfectly indifferent to the pass-
ing current, unless it be itself a compound of more elementary ions, and 80 snbject
to actual decomposition. Upon this fact is founded much of the proof adduced in
favour of the new theory of electro-chemical decomposition, which I put forth in a
former series of these Researches (518. &c.).
