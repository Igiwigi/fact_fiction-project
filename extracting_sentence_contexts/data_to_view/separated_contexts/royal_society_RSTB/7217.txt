In the author’s opinion, the stereoscopic effect is more
striking in the case of red and blue-green backgrounds than it is with the other backgrounds
mentioned.

(101) The effects of chromatic difference of magnification on vision

Two visual phenomena are affected: (a) stereoscopic vision, and (4) acuity for fine detail. With regard to the former, subjects in whom there is positive chromatic stereoscopy owing
to the optical axes being to the nasal side of the visual axes in one or both eyes—and,
according to Tscherning, this is usually the case—see what artists refer to as advancing and
retiring colours: warm colours, such as red, orange and brown, advance, while the cold
colours, blue-green, blue and violet, retire. These facts skilfully used may be very effective
in paintings. The value of this form of stereoscopy lies in the fact that it operates for objects
of all sizes and for objects at all distances from the observer. Normal stereoscopic vision—
increasingly effective the nearer the object to the observer—fails at great distances, owing
to the smallness of the range base provided by the interocular distance.
