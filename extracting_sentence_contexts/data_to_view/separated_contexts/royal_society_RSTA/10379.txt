A rather striking illustration of the points of agreement and difference just
discussed, was afforded by the case of V at Kew. As already stated, all the tables
had to be re-ealeulated, making allowance for the non-application of a temperature
correction in earlier years of the period. I was puzzled for a time by the, at first
sight, remarkable fact that whilst the new values of ¢, differed very appreciably from
the old, there was exceedingly little difference between the new and old values of the
other ¢ coefficients, or of any of the phase angles. The explanation simply was that
the external diurnal temperature inequality was pretty exactly represented in the
magnetograph room—of course, on a very much reduced scale—with the hours of
maximum and minimum so retarded as to bring them much closer to the corresponding
times for the diurnal variation of V.

§ 70. There are other important coriclusions to be drawn from the comparison of
temperature and magnetics.
