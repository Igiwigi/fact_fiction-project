The ash beds are more irregular in
this respect, and within short distances may show considerable variations. But,
taken as a whole, they always agree fairly well with the dip of the lava flows, and
they practically never show an inclination towards the centre of the island. We are,
in fact, dealing with a highly eroded volcanic pile, a chain of old voleanoes, and the
position of the craters and outlets must have nearly corresponded with the central
ridge of hills. The radial outward dip is a reflex of the slopes down which the
lavas flowed, and on which the ash beds gathered. Over these surfaces the streams
ran in more or less direct courses to the sea.
