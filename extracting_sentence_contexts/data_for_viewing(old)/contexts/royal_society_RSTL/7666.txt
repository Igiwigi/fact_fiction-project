other words, the evaporation from the surface of the brass weight (153-1 square centi-
metres) will have twice and -1 as much effect on its temperature as the evaporation from
the surface of the copper weight (182-1 8quare centimetres) has on its temperature ; yet
the results obtained with the two weights are almost identical.

A series of experiments has nevertheless been undertaken, in which the specific heat
of the 10 per cent. and 20 per cent. spirit was estimated, by observing the heating-effect of
a known weight of either liquid, heated to a known temperature, upon a known weight of
distilled water contained in a calorimeter. The liquid was at first enclosed in a thin glass
bulb, which was heated with its contents to the desired point, by being immersed in a
mercury-bath as recommended by Professor Koyp. The results, though generally con-
firming the previous experiments, did not agree among themselves as well as could be
wished. This seemed chiefly owing to the fact that a globular body, having the greatest
cubical capacity for a given surface, is not well adapted for the rapid cooling of its con-
tents. In consequence of this, when about 50 cub. centims. of liquid were employed,

from fifteen to twenty minutes were required to bring the temperature of the calori-
meter to a maximum, or rather to the point whence the temperature began to ink; for
the calorimeter frequently remained stationary at its maximum temperature for five or
8x minutes. On this account the correction applied amounted to a considerable frac-
