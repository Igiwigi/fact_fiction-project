greater depression of temperature would no doubt have been observed, but the inves-
tigation was not further pursued in this direction.

proportion of nitrate is mixed with water, is to be-attributed principally to the fact of
the nitrate being in more dilute solution than in the other case described ; for it is found
on diluting a concentrated aqueous solution that the cold is produced in the earlier
stages of the dilution. It is perhaps also to be attributed, to a slight extent, to the
presence of more ammonia than in the other cases ; since it is possible that ammonia
in the liquefied condition may generate a little heat when mixed with water, and this
must mask the cold produced by the nitrate to a corresponding extent.

The accompaniment of contraction of yolume by absorption of heat, here illustrated,
has received several explanations. Gav-LussAc, in accounting for it, considered that the
specific heat of the mixture must be greater than the mean of the specific heats of the
saline solution and the water ; but 'THomsEN's* researches have shown that the specific
heat of a mixture of an aqueous solution and water is ess than the mean of the specific
