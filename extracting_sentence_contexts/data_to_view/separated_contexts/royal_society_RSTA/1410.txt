and that they diminish progressively in value. The method of series suffices to calculate Y in terms of X, provided X is not too close
to unity, but in practice a difficulty arises, since dY/dX becomes infinite for X = 1,

as is shown by the fact that the series obtained by differentiating >» Oy +ng ”" *™ diverges

for X = 1. Since X = 1 at burnt for 0 = 1 (equation (75) ), and dY/dX occurs in the expression
for the shot velocity, this method is not suitable for ballistic calculations with propellants
in the shape of cireular cords. Using (75), the pressure and shot velocity in terms of X

and Y are
