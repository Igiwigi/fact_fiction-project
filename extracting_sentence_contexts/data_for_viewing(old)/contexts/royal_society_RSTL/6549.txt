In this direction of compression, the hardest slate is more than double as compressible
as the hardest quartz.

When compressed transverse to the lamina, however, the hard slate and hard quartz
prove to have very nearly the same coefficient of compressIbility, which is very small for
both; while the softest slate and the softest quartz, compressed in the same way (trans-
verse to lamina), have also nearly the same coefficient of compressibility, but one about
four times as great as for the hardest like rocks.

These facts point towards the circumstance of the original deposit and formation of
these rocks as their efficient causes. Both rocks consist of particles more or less wedge-
Shaped and flat, angular fragments more or less crystalline, deposited together, with
their larger dimensions in the planes of lamination, which lamination has been produced
by enormous compression in a direction transverse to its planes. Hence the mass of
these rocks has already been subjected to enormous compression in the 8ame direction
as that in which we now find their further compressibility the least. But, besides that
we might from 7his cause alone anticipate a higher compressibility when the pressure is
applied to them parallel to the lamination, another condition comes into play ; their
aggregation of flat, wedge-shaped particles, when thus pressed edgeways, tends power-
fully to their mutual lateral expansion, and hence to their giving way in the line of
pres8ure,
