the general term of Cell-force; and seem entitled to affirm that each is a particular
modus operandi of the same force as that which is concerned in cell-formation #.

* It may now be considered as a well-established fact, that the simple fibrous tissues may originate in a
structureless blastema, and may be produced by its fibrillation, without passing through the intermediate con-
dition of cells. But these tissues cannot be regarded as possessing any truly vital endowments ; their proper-
ties being simply physical, and their uses in the economy merely mechanical.

+ This general proposition was first advanced by the author in regard to the operations in which orgaaic life
consists (and which are common, therefore, to plants and animals), in his © Report on the Origin and Functions
of Cells” in the Brit. and For. Med. Review for January 1843. The subsequent discovery of the cellular
composition of the ultimate fibrilla of striated muscular fibre, by himself and Prof. Snazyzy contemporaneously,
and the accumulation of various facts relative to the existence of cells or cell-nuclei at the peripheral extremi-
ties of the afferent nerves, as well as in the central organs, seem to justify the assertion that unmetamorphosed
cells are the active agents in the production of Muscular and Nervous force; in the former case effecting con-
traction by their change of form, and in the latter deyeloping nerve-force, which is transmitted along the fibres
as its conductors.

{ The author is particularly desirous that he should be understood as implying by the term © cell-force,”
not that the force is produced or generated by the cell, but that the growth of the cell is the most general
objective manifestation of that force, and that the cell affords the ordinary instrumental condition for its exer-
tion, though there can be no doubt that the force may be exerted in many cases in which cell-deyelopment
does not take place, The use which he would make of the term is just that which is commonly made of the
term © Engine-power;” every one knowing that the steam-engine possesses no power itself, but that it is
simply the instrument most commonly employed, because the most convenient and adyantageous yet devised,
