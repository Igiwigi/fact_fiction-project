of Europe, and of these very few have sufficiently large pupils to allow of their being
examined by the ophthalmoscope. I have therefore had to remain content with the
examination of a few species belonging to four families, viz., the Ranide, Hylide,
Bufonidee and Salamandride. The first three families present a fundus entirely different
from that of any other Vertebrate. They all exhibit an exceptionally well-developed
vascular system, consisting of a characteristic vena media with lateral branches, which
lie in the hyaloid membrane in front of the retina. The main trunk stands out in
conspicuous relief, and passes vertically down in front of the dise. So large and
prominent is it, that in several species, notably in Rana catesbiana (North American
bull-frog), and Hyla versicolor (White tree-frog) the large red nucleated blood corpuscles
can be seen with the ophthalmoscope quite distinctly streaming in single or double
file through the lumen of the vessel. So beautifully clear are they that I cannot help
calling attention to the fact that under a magnification of 16 or 20 diameters (which
obtains when viewed through the ophthalmoscope by the upright image) these animals
might prove of great utility for physiological experiments.

In all the species of Ranidee and Bufonide the disc is long and narrow, and directed
vertically downwards immediately behind the median vein. A similarly shaped disc
may be seen in a large number of birds, but it differs in the latter in being invariably
directed obliquely and not vertically downwards, and, moreover, it is always more or
less completely hidden by the densely pigmented pecten, an organ which does not
exist in any Amphibian which I have examined. But this is exactly what one would
be led to expect, as I have pointed out in my previous work on the “ Mammalian Eye”
(pages 53-54), since the pecten is a secretory organ whose function is to supply
