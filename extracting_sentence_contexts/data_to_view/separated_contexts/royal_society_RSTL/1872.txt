erroneously concludes that this membrane has proper yessels, arising from the
Sources above enumerated, and having no connexion with those of the liver,
All the capsular arteries, arising from whatever source, ramify in the proper
capsule, and they may be all injected from the hepatic artery. I bave never
seen injected vessels in the peritoneum, but as recent adhesions between the
liver and diaphragm may be injected from the hepatic artery, it appears evi-
dent that the peritoneal coat of the liver is nourished by this artery. That the
proper vessels of the liver anastomose with those which Warrzr calls the proper
vessels of the membrane, is proved by the fact, that recent adhesions between
the right lung and the diaphragm may be injected from the hepatic artery, the
injection passing from the capsular branches of this vessel into those of the
phrenic, and thence into the phrenic arteries themselves #. The capsular veins
are branches of the portal vein; these vessels communicate freely with branches
of the phrenic veins. In some cases of atrophy of the liver, and in cases in
which the circulation through the liver has been for some time obstructed, a
