We are, therefore, convinced that the ‘* Amnion-
gang” in SrERNBERG’s specimen represents the detached vesicular end of the allantoic
canal. STERNBERG, it is of interest to note, describes the tubular part of the supposed

“ Amniongang ” as showing signs of degeneration. Our suggestion is supported not
only by the fact that Srernpere did not find an “ Amnionnabel ” (p. 182), but also
by Srreerer’s (1919) observations on the Mateer-embryo, where he describes the

“ allantois” as separated into two parts. They are so close to each other that there
can be no doubt that they are parts of one and the same formation (STREETER, 1919,
Plate I, fig. 6 ; text-figs. 1-2 (sections 58-79) and text-fig. 3), but in the Mateer-embryo
the separated distal part of the allantoic canal is not enlarged. We accordingly regard
the conditions in the Mateer-embryo as transitional between those seen in our embryo
and in STERNBERG’s specimen.
