Chapman (1888) confirmed Watson’s description, and Grimpe (1916) published some
observations on the external genital anatomy of the female, together with some
interesting information on the breeding of the species in captivity. The latter point is
treated more fully by Schneider (1926). Neuville (1935,1936 a, 6) describes and discusses
the external female genitalia of two aged menagerie specimens, and those of a newly
born pup. Nothing further of importance has been traced on the subject: the few
additional papers of minor interest are those of Schmotzer and Zimmerman (1922) and
Grimpe (1923).

The subject of reproduction in the spotted hyaena thus appeared to be one into
which investigation was desirable. Little or no material was available in Europe, and
correspondence with the Game Departments of Kenya and Tanganyika revealed the
fact that, though the spotted hyaena is one of the commonest animals in many parts of
Africa, nothing was known of its breeding, beyond the popular accounts of herma-
phroditism referred to above. In the autumn of 1935, therefore, the author travelled to
East Africa to study the animal.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The most promising way of investigating the problem in hand appeared to be to
examine as large a series of spotted hyaenas as possible. The writer therefore chartered
a 30-cwt. lorry at Arusha, Tanganyika Territory, loaded it with the necessary camping
and collecting equipment, and set off ‘‘on safari” in search of hyaenas. They are to be
found in Tanganyika wherever game is plentiful: a good hunting ground was found on
the Balbal plains, below the mountain of that name, west of the Ngorongoro crater, on
