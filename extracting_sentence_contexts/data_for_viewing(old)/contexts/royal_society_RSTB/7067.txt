Ficure 3. A, B. Diuresis curves, rabbit 18, 12 February 1943 (A) and 19 February 1943 (B).
To show one method of distinguishing a questionable anti-diuretic effect (A) by repetition of same
experiment. The stimuli applied during the course of the two experiments were of the same intensity
(1.c.D. 1-75cm.). C. Diuresis curve, demonstrating a well-marked anti-diuretic effect following
stimulation of the infundibular lobe (rabbit 15, 14 August 1942).

It is well known from the work of Verney and his associates that emotional stress and
exercise may inhibit a water diuresis in dogs, probably acting through a reflex stimulation
of the neurohypophysis, and therefore the possibility arose that the handling of the rabbits
necessary for the application of the stimulus, or some other factor apart from the stimulus
itself, might be responsible for the anti-diuretic effects observed. That this is not so is shown
clearly by the following facts: (i) the clear-cut difference in the results obtained in the
control animals, group A, and the experimental animals, group C; (ii) the animals that
responded to stimulation were subjected to control ‘stimuli’ in which the primary coil was
held at right angles to the buried secondary coil. These control procedures involved similar
degrees of disturbance to and handling of the rabbits, without the electrical stimulation,
and in no case was an anti-diuretic effect observed; (iii) various procedures that effectively
disturbed and frightened the animals (such as the passage of a stomach tube) only occa-
sionally produced a mild anti-diuresis. Thus it may be assumed that the inhibition of urine
flow observed to follow an appropriate stimulus was not due to any emotional stress accom-
panying the application of that stimulus.
