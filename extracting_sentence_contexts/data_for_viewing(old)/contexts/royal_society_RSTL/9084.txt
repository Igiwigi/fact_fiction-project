Tt will be obseryved from this table that whilst all the hones of the wing
have been reduced in length (and strength), the scapula has not been affected by the
diminished amount of exercise taken by this bird, As regards form, it is exactly
the s8ame as in other Herons, viz., tapering behind, without dilatation.

With regard to the leg, M. Milne-Edwards, guided in his estimate of the general
size of the bird by the length of the skull and femur, inferred that this part of the
os8e0us frame was much reduced in length. Having shown from the pelvis, with
which M. Milne-Edwards was not acquainted, that the body of this hird was
considerably less in size than he supposed, in fact equal to that of the Yuropean
Night-Heron, we arrive at the opposite conelusion, viz., that the leg is proportionally
mueh more deyeloped in length and strength. And this will be readily perceived
from the following table :—
