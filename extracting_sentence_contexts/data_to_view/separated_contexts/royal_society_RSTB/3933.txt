it is necessary to suppose that eggs which develop normally without elimination, and
those in which elimination occurs, all give rise to the same form of larve. As in the
cross 1. acutus 2 X E. miliaris ¢ , the eliminated chromosomes are not connected with
the larval characters. It will be observed that all the explanations are entirely negative, each is based
upon an assumption for which at present there is no prospect of proof; in fact, it
must be admitted that these hybrids afford us no evidence in favour of the correlation
of definite larval characters with certain of the chromosomes,

Again, Baurzer’s explanation of the Antedon hybrid, and the application of his
principle to explain the hybrid 4. miliaris 2 x E. acutus $ and E. miliaris ¢
x E. esculentus ¢ , mullities his suggestions concerning the eliminated chromosomes in
the hybrid Strongylocentrotus ? x
