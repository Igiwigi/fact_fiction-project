) dt. (8.2)

Note that the term in the integrand which is independent of f cancels with a term from the zero-
swap diagonal piece above.


9. Explicit formula: two swaps
For the term with two swaps, we have
00 1 IT \ B= -8-2s xs

If T? > 7X, then the answer will be 0 as can be seen by moving the path of integration to the
right. If T? < 47?X, then we use the fact that

¢-a-y—~s)é—p-y —s)el—a —6 ~s)¢(1— B —8 —s)
¢(2-a—B-y—65—2s)

has poles ats=a+y,a+6,6+y and f + 4; so together with the residue from the pole at s = 0,

we will get a total of five terms for this integral:

Z(-y, -8, —a — s,—B —s)
