214 Mr. ScortsBy's experiments and observations on' the

large employed, there would be no limit to the attractive force
developed in the steel wires, until they were magnetised' to
saturation. The quantity of effect produced by an iron bar
seems to be in some certain proportion to the amount of its
own magnetic energy, as indicated by its action on a compass
needle, but not in the proportion of its lifting power.

5. Itis a well known fact in magnetics, that the capacity
of steel for magnetism is increased by time—by repeated re-
newals of the magnetising process at intervals—and by keep-
ing the magnet under constraint, either by the contact of
other magnetic substances, or by the use of conductors be-
tween the opposite poles. Hence I expected, that a wire
magnetised by percussion to a maximum for the time, might
have its power subsequently increased, day after day, in con-
sequence of its capacity being increased by a repetition of the
process. To a certain extent this was the case; but when
the iron bars had acquired their maximum energy, and the
wires were then hammered until there was a decided sus-
pension of increase of energy, no future repetition of the
