influenced the programmes which were used in the calculation.

Secondly, unless special provision is made in the programme, all the numerical data must
be less than unity in modulus. There are a few general ways in which this problem can be
overcome, such as working with numbers stored in floating decimal form, that is, to specify
a number by two quantites a and / the value of the number being a10”, where a is less than
unity in modulus and / is an integer, positive or negative. However, very often in any par-
ticular calculation there is a particular method which enables the EDSAC to complete the
calculation quicker than if some general method were used.

It is mainly these two general problems which make the task of constructing a programme
for most calculations quite complicated. If such a programme were going to be used only
once, in spite of the fact that the EDSAC performs the calculation much more quickly
than could be done with a desk machine, in many cases it would be doubtful ifit were worth
while constructing the programme. However, in addition to the speed of the EDSAC,
there is a second very important advantage: when a programme has once been con-
structed it is punched on tape, and this tape and copies of it can be used for any number of
similar calculations with different numerical quantities, thus saving very much time. Thus,
although the EDSAC was very useful in the calculation of atomic wave functions reported

in this paper, it will be even more effective in future calculations of this type.

The first part of the calculation to be programmed, which had previously been the longest
part of the calculation, was the calculation of all the electrostatic integrals [PnGq19-Po1*s
