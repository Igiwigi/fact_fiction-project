The value of $\—89

96. Remembering that $, and s, are taken respectively to represent the mean range
of the quantity Q for the groups of molecules which have w respectively positive and
negative, and taking s', 8', to represent the values of s, 8, at the surface 2=c, we may
express $,—8, as a function of s, c, and 2.

The fact that 8,=8,=s when the point considered is without the range of the
influence of the surface, shows that whatever may be the value of 8\—8, $—8z
gradually diminishes as the point considered recedes from the solid surface, until at
some distance depending on s at which the mean range is unaffected by the surface
$—8z=0. Tt also appears from the fact of the gas being symmetrical about the
axis of the tube that 8s, —s, is zero at the axis, s0 that even if the value of s, is limited
by the surface, 8, approximates to 8; as the point econsidered approaches the axis of
the tube.

The definite manner in which 8, —s, varies across the tube could only be deduced by
taking into account the distribution of velocities amongst the molecules ; but as 8; —8z :
must change after a continuous manner from one surface to another, we may take for
an illustration, or even for an approximation, any law of variation which fits the
extremes.

Such a law is given by
