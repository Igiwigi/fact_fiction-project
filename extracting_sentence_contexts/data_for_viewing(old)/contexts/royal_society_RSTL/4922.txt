But however much our knowledge has become settled in regard to the nature of
the spermatic bodies themselyes, and their mode of development, their relation to
the fluid portion of the semen in which they are contained is still a matter of doubt.
H. Goops1s|| regards certain albuminous flakes in the fluid portions of the semen of
Crustacea as the debris of dissolved cells, and as the source of nourishment and deve-
lopment of the spermatozoa ; while a more recent observer, Dr. KirkzsT, regards the
spermatozoa as the elaborators of the fluid, and the conveyers of it to the ovum at
the time of impregnation. This latter snupposition was originally advocated by Wac-
NER, VALENTINE and Biscyore. But two of these observers bave recently changed
their views*#, and now regard the fluid portion as only of secondary importance in
impregnation, and the spermatic bodies as of essential. This view, as WacneR
statesFF#, is founded chiefly on the fact that in some of the invertebrata the whole mass
