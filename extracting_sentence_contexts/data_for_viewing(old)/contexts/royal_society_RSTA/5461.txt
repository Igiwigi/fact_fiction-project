Figure 7. (a) Projected distribution of dark matter in the COSMOS field from the analysis of
Massey et al. (2007a). The blue map reveals the density of dark matter as inferred from the pattern
of weak distortions viewed in background galaxies by the Hubble Space Telescope. (b) Equivalent
map for the baryonic matter as revealed by a combination of the stellar mass in galaxies imaged
with the Hubble Space Telescope and hot gas imaged with the X-ray satellite XMM-Newton.

(Massey et al. 2007a; figure 7a). This map of dark matter can be compared with
that of the light in the same direction as revealed by visible galaxies and X-ray
clusters (figure 7b). To first order, there is a reassuring similarity, indicative of
the fact that dark matter acts as the gravitational framework (or scaffolding) for
the normal baryonic material.

(ii) ‘Gi

g’: the extent of dark matter haloes around individual

In addition to tracing dark matter around clusters and on cosmic scales, a
similar statistical technique can be applied around individual galaxies to detect
their dark matter ‘haloes’. Suppose that we conduct a large spectroscopic survey
of bright nearby galaxies and select a subset of systems of a particular class for
which we have deeper imaging data. By ‘stacking’ the imaging data for that
class of object, we can determine the average density of dark matter around
