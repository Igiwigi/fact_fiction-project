is always small. The ridges are scarcely recognizable, but a slight interradial knob
occurs on the peristomial margin. The specimen figured is 9-4 mm in height, and the
top of the process is 1-7 mm from its base. The girdle is thus rather less than one-fifth
of the height of the test-cavity, but it is a robust and prominent feature.

Notes.—I have found several keeled teeth, and other lantern fragments, in washings
of the Faringdon Greensand, and many of these may have belonged to Hyposalenia.
Since species of T'etragramma also occur in the deposit, it is not possible to be certain
on this point, but it may be assumed that Hyposalenia, like Salenia, was one of the
Stirodonta.

In this connexion, it is interesting to find that the girdle of the reputed “ Salenia ”
from the Faringdon Greensand is exactly like that of H. wrighti. This fact seems to
support the suggestion that I have made previously (1923, p. 211) that the rare speci-
mens with saleniform periprocts that are associated with the abundant Hyposalenias
in this deposit may be variants of that species, and not generically distinct. Certainly,
if the disconnected girdle of such a recent species as Salenia pattersoni A. Ag., represents
the typical condition in the genus Salenia, the forms from Faringdon cannot belong to
that genus in spite of the radial displacement of their periprocts.
