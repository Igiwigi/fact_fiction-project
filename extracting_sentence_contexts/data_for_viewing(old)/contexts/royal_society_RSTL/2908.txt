98 MR. LUBBOCK ON THE TIDES.

London Docks made under the direction of the late Mr. Peirce; the latter tables
differing from those given in the Philosophical Transactions for 1836, Part I., chiefly
by being founded upon nearly double the number of observations. The high waters
at Liverpool considered in this paper occur about 48 hours after the transit of the
moon to which they are referred ; the tides at London which are considered occur
about 50 hours after the transit to which they are referred in this discussion, 80
that in fact all the intervals of the Liverpool Tables given in this paper ought to be
increased by 36 hours, and all the intervals in the London Tables by 48 hours. The
tide which makes high water at Liverpool arrives at the same instant somewhere on
the north-east coast of Scotland, and at London ahout fifteen hours later. This is
proved by the epoch of the semimenstrual inequality.
I find by interpolation from Table II. the interval for the moon's transit A

At 3 o'clock . . . 1 23 405
and at 9 o'clock . . ., 2 1 20

The difference is 1* 215, which converted into space
= 20 22' log tan 20* 22' = 956965 = log (4). (See p. 117.)
