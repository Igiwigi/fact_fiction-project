So why did the Met Office come
in for such ridicule in the press, when making a probabilistic prediction for the
summer of 2009? Perhaps, it is the media rather than the public that does no
understand (or maybe chooses not to understand) these matters. In fact, if the public were more exposed to weather prediction as inherently
probabilistic, perhaps there would be more acceptance of the simple fact tha‘
one’s view about the risk of dangerous climate change should not be framec
in the black and white terms of ‘belief’ and ‘scepticism’. For one thing, belief
should have no real role in science, and, in truth, all good scientists are inherently
sceptical people. However, we can go further than this.
