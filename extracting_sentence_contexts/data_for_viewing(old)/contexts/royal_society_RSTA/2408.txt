]. Introduction

Synchrotron radiation (SR) is now widely used in multi-
purpose scientific probes all around the world. The
prevalence of SR is due to the fact that its high-
energy photons make excellent probes for exploring
the atomic and/or electronic structures of materials,
making SR indispensable for today’s science and
technology. SR is, by definition, electromagnetic radiation
generated when relativistic charged particles are forced
by some external force to bend their trajectories. We can
