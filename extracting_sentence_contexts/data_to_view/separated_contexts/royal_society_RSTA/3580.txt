Until recently, this had, however, not been examined in terms of the
brain’s functional temporal dynamics. For example, while the hippocampus is well known to


receive multimodal input and play a critical role in memory formation and global integration,
graph theoretical studies of the structural connectome had surprisingly failed to demonstrate
the topological centrality of this region. Thus, by using a whole-brain computational model
constrained by the empirical SC of the macaque brain and in which information flow was
modelled as a discrete-event queueing network, it was shown that the hippocampus in fact
receives a disproportionately high level of information flow and acts a convergence zone for the
network [107]. Similarly, another whole-brain modelling study recently examined the effects of in
silico lesions to the highest-ranking ‘binding nodes’ identified using the methodology introduced
above on measures of systemic integration and encoding of information capability. It was found
that removal of the binding-nodes had a more profound effect on the aforementioned measures
than removal of the ‘rich-club’ regions whose topological importance is solely defined by the
anatomical connectome [108].
