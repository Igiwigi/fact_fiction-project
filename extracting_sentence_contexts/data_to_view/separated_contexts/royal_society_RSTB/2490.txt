In conclusion, it may be said of the Polypodiaceze that the primitive form of
tubular central cylinder is apparently that with internal phloem, but the internal
sieve-tubes sometimes partially or wholly degenerate. There appears to be no
evidence from the standpoint of development in favour of the view that the poly-
stelic type of VAN TrucaHem is derived from the repeated bifurcation of the cauline

central cylinder of the young stem. Developmental data seem further to establish
the fact that the primitive condition of central cylinder in the Polypodiaceze is a
concentric fibro-vascular tube interrupted by lacunze subtending the outgoing leaf-

traces. The medullary strands of the Polypodiaceze are of secondary origin, and
are derived from the internal wall of the primitive stelar tube.
