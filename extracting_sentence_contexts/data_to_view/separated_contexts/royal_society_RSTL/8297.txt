Mr. PEXGELLY states that © Windmill Hill is entirely composed of impure thin-bedded,
Feaved and jointed limestone belonging to the Devonian system,” —one set of joints
hEving a © prevalent direction of N. 82? E. to S. 82 W., and the second running nearly
maenetic north and south. In fact they have the bearings of the Brixham valleys.” The
pkimes of the first underlie or dip southward, whilst those of the second are approxi-
mately vertical. The stratification and cleavage-planes intersect at an angle of about
f, and with the joints cause the rock to break readily into pieces of small dimensions.
