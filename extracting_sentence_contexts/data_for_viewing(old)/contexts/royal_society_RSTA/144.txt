is studied as a discrete mathematical object, then correctness is a Boolean notion
and can be established by proof: the program either satisfies its requirements or
it does not. This prevalent view of programs as discrete partial functions on
values or states has led to tremendous successes: it enabled the most
fundamental paradigms of the science of computing, including the theories of
computability, complexity and semantics.

However, in computer science, unlike in other engineering disciplines, we often
lose sight of the fact that the mathematical representation of a software system is
just a model, and that the actual system is physical, executing on a physical
imperfect platform and interacting with a physical unknowable environment.
The realization that programs are ultimately physical shatters the Boolean
illusion. Of two mathematically correct programs, one may be preferable to the
other owing to the way it behaves if the platform or environment deviates from
the nominal expectations, be it due to resource limitations, failures, attacks or
simply erroneous or incomplete specifications. To some degree, this observation
guides the design of robust non-embedded software, for example, by having the
system check whether the input values lie within expected ranges. Moreover, one
program may be more fault tolerant than another, functionally equivalent
program, resilient against a larger class of potential attacks, etc. But the
incompleteness of the sharp Boolean view becomes most apparent in embedded
