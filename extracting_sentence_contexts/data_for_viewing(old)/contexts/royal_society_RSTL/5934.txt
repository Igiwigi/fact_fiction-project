It is of great importance to place beyond dispute the mode in which the generative
masses (fig. 27, 6) occupying the special segments are related to the ciliated tubes (7, 4).
The first impression is that there must be some connexion between them ; else why the
enormous growth of the tubes in the reproductive ring, as compared with those of other
parts? 'The demonstration of this point is attended with great difficulty. The rolling of
the animal under view, and the density of the integuments, preclude a clear inspection ;
but it may be constantly seen that the ovarian mass (cb) moves to and fro with the dilated
portion of the tube (4). It is impoxsible to 82 the opening by which the ova arrive

certain, for they have been actually seen therein on several occasions by the author, as
Shown at fig. 2 a*. From this portion of the tube they escape by the external orifice.

It was the discoyery and the clear definition of this important anatomical fact, which
tirst convinced the author that he was justified in deducing from this arrangement the
tinal conclusion, that the ovarian and testicular masses in NAS did not constitute detached
and independent viscera, but that they were structures which were evolved from, or ingrafted
upon, Â« segmental organ, specially modified for this PUrPOSE.

This conclusion has been since arrived at by several different modes of observation.

The testes on the other side bear the 8ame relation to the tube as the ovary on the
Side just described. The wtriculus on the one side is represented by the ejaculatory
pouch on the other. At present it is beyond the power of science to explain why these
organs, in only one or two annuli of the body, should be implicated in the sexual deve-
