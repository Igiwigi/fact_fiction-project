2 as paired nerves arising antero-laterally from the brain in company
with the antennal and ‘frontal nerves’, are seen in the rostrum to lie dorsal to the recurrent
nerve between the right and left series of pharyngeal dilator muscles (referred to by Murray
& Tiegs as oesophageal dilators). The interpretation is therefore suggested that the labral
nerves lie with the recurrent nerve in the median blood channel which I have already

mentioned (p. 268). In point of fact, however, only the recurrent nerve is found in this
portion of the haemocoele, the labral nerves lying in the lateral portions of the rostral
haemocoele (p. 271). In giving an account, therefore, of the structures lying within the rostrum of Calandra,
it is necessary to pay detailed attention to the stomatogastric portion of the nervous
system. It should be borne in mind that the following description results from the examina-
tion of series of transverse, frontal and sagittal sections, whereas that given by Murray &
Tiegs may be based, in part at least, on the information derived from dissections, for these
