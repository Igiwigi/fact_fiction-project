Examples occurred to me, both of the chemical division and che-
mical synthesis of the elements, by which various phenomena hitherto obscure might
be explained. The experiments of the first class prove that a division of the elemental
bodies which is known to occur in certain cases of chemical change, is truly a che-
mical and not simply a mechanical division of these substances. This is shown by
the fact that the particles of the element thus separated show the peculiar combining
properties of * nascent bodies.” Tt is not necessary to my argument that the precise
view which I have given of the nature of this © nascent state ” should be admitted ;
provided only it be allowed, that these properties depend upon the fact that the par-
ticle is issuing from a state of combination, which is generally allowed. 1.
