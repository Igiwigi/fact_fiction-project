process would appear to depend to a great extent upon the dialysis of the lime salts.
The matrix of both tissues being a substance to a considerable extent removed from
the pale of nutrition, we should expect physical processes to play a large part.
While, however, the 7dle of purely physical processes has to be taken into considera-
tion, it must be remembered that, as Prof. Painter says (2), “the behaviour of the
living cell membrane towards the substances with which it comes in contact is in
many cases incapable of interpretation on a purely physical basis.” This is instanced
by the altered conditions in dead cells which permit the penetration of stains to
which they are impervious when living, and also by the fact, which he instances,
that the salts contained in the blood corpuscle differ from those in the plasma, the
corpuscles containing an abundance of potassium and phosphate, while the plasma
shows a large proportion of sodium and chloride, and little of the potassium and
phosphates. These facts show that “a purely physical theory of the exchanges
which take place across a living membrane is inadequate ; there is a physiological
permeability as well as a physical permeability.”

The Artificial Production of Calcospherites.

In the year 1858 Rarney published his work on molecular coalescence (3), showing
that lime salts were deposited in colloidal substances, not in a crystalline, but in a
globular form, the globules having a very definite structure and arrangement. He
also showed that in many animal organisms, as mollusca and crustacea, similar forms
appeared during the process of calcification of the shell.
