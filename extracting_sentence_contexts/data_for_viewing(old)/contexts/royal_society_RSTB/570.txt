tree. More pertinent still, is the action of the nitrifying organisms in rendering the
organic nitrogen of the soil and subsoil available to the higher plants. It may well be
supposed, therefore, that there may be other cases in which lower organisms bring the

organic nitrogen of the soil and subsoil into a more available condition ; whilst
it seems not improbable that the growth and crop-residue of certain plants favour the
development and action of special organisms. In conclusion we would submit that,
whether or not it may eventually be conclusively proved that lower organisms have
the power of bringing free nitrogen into combination within the soil, it would at any
rate be not inconsistent with well established facts, were it found that the lower serve
the higher, chiefly, if not exclusively, by bringing into a condition available to them,
the combined nitrogen already existing, but in a comparatively inert state, in our soils
and subsoils.

As it seemed to us that, of the various results which have been considered relating
to the fixation of free nitrogen, those of Hetnriecen and WiLFARTH are the most
definite and significant, we decided to institute experiments on somewhat similar
lines. We hoped to commence them early in the summer, but were not able to do so
until the beginning of August. Decisive results cannot, therefore, be expected this
