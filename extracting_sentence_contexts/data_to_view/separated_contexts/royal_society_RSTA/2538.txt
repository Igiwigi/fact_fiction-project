If, however, Group I. be sub-divided into Group Ia.
and Group Is., we may take the similar nebulous lines 19, 21, 26, 31, 87, 165, 213, 217,
as forming the more displaced group for which the value of d/d* is about 5x 107". The corresponding value for the remainder is not very different from 2°5 x 10-™. This would give a ratio of displacement for the three groups 2°5: 5: 10°75, which is
close to that found for the iron spectrum, namely, 1: 2°2: 4°5, and not far from
1:2:4, but it would only be justified if the division into three groups were an
established fact. -

It may be pointed out that the d/)’ diagram (fig. 2), favours this relationship (the
ratios would be 1°3 : 2°7 : 5°2), but, as has already been discussed, the diagram labours
under the disadvantage of including 247 in the intermediate group, dissociating it
from lines which it more strongly resembles, and it separates the similar lines 87, 165,
213, and 217. These difficulties are obviated in the d/d* frequency curves.
