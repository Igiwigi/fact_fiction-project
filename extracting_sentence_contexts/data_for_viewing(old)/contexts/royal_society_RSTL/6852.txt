the double contour), and then they arbitrarily assert that a fibre which does not present
these characters cannot be nervous; and even if it be continuous with an undoubted
nerve-fibre, it is put down as connective tissue. 'The alterations which are produced
in undoubted nerve-fibres by stretching, pressure, and the influence of water must not
be forgotten.

It is trae that during the last few years pale fibres have been admitted to exist in
some situations besides the Pacinian corpuscle ; but few obseryers will be prepared to
admit the existence of a very extensive distribution of delicate pale nucleated nerve-
fibres in every part of the peripheral nervous system, or that, the active portion of all
nerve-fibres exhibits the same essential anatomical characters, and that in all cases com»
plete circuits exist, while free ends are nowhere to be found: yet these general con-
clusions are justified by facts which have been demonstrated *.

Conclusions.

The following are some of the most important general conclusions I have arrived at
in the course of this inquiry :—

1. That in all cases nerve-cells are connected with nerve-fibres, and that a cell pro-
bably influences only the fibres with which it is structurally continuous.

2. That apolar and unipolar nerve-cells do not exist, but that all nerve-cells have at
least two fibres in connexion with them.
