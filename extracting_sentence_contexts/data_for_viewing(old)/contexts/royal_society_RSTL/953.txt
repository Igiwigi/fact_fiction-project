The frames of a mercantile ship (on the present mode of
building) before they are placed and united to each other,
may be seen in PI. VIII. Fig. g, with their chocks or wedge-
pieces. To the evils already stated of the present practice,
mayÂ» be added that of imperfect workmanship, so that the
surfaces of the chocks are seldom in contact with those 'of
the timbers; and the ends of both are frequently. reduced $0
thin, as to split by the fastenings that are necessary to secure
the planks to the ribs; and thus the ship, in the event of
grounding, or even in the act of rolling, derives little sup-
port from timbers united only, in fact, by two narrow edges.

Another great defect arising out of the present plan of
constructing mercantile ships is, that the ends of the lower
ribs or timbers, commonly termed the lower futtocks, (PI.
VIII. Fig. g. B) are not continued across the keel C, so that
no'support is given in a transverse direction when the 'ship
touches the ground ; nor any aid to counteract the constant
pressure of the mast. This great sacrifice of srength and
safety is made for no other purpose than that of giving a pas-
sage for the water to the pumps.

The floor timbers, which by this mode of construction are
