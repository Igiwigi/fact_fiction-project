There is also the current of displacement when the p
dielectric is excited, consisting of a drift within small range of the opposed positi
‘and negative electrons in each molecule, owing to its orientation by the electric fielc
There is also a current due to convection of an excited dielectric, which in the case 0
uniform velocity may be represented as formally equivalent to a magnetization of
medium, Then again there is the molecular current, due to the orbital motions ¢
the electrons in the molecule ; so long as we avoid the dynamics of molecular structur
we can only consider the time average of this current, and that is most convenien Y
represented as the magnetic polarity of the molecule ; the displacement current in
dielectric above mentioned involves a similar process of averaging with respect

There is also the current of convection of electrons which rearranges the
etrie charge of a conductor. Of this last practically nothing is known ; the subject
wholly eluded experimental enquiry, except in the case of electrolytes, where the
odern theories of solution and electrolysis, in the hands of Hrrrorr, Kontrauscn,
(RRHENTUS, and Nernst, have yielded at any rate the first approximation to an
nalytical theory, As a matter of fact, the empirical and variable character of con-
ctivity as depending on physical state, and its overwhelming importance as
ompared with the other phenomena in conductors of metallic type, restriets within
arrow limits the problems in which a knowledge of their relations of convection and
larization would be of practical import. Finally, there is one case in which an experimentally recognized result in the
vedium involves the dynamics of the molecule ; when the magnetic field is increased
he orbital motions in the molecule are altered so as to oppose the change, and this
induced alteration in the molecular current constitutes diamagnetism. 8.
