edge than others, and that the variety of species became greater and the colour dif-
ferent on ascending to greater heights. It would therefore be an interesting point for
a geologist sufficiently skilled in botany to determine whether the extent of the lichens
and mosses downwards towards the water on this coast, where the rocks are supposed
to be always rising, presents different phenomena from the line of vegetation on other
coasts, where the relative level of the land and sea is known to have remained sta-
tionary.

On many parts of the eastern coast, above described, the sea freezes in severe
winters in the Skir ; that is to say, among the rocks and islets which skirt the main
land, and where there is almost always still water. As I have before mentioned the
accounts which I received of the transporting power of ice in the Gulf of Bothnia,
it may be well to state some facts bearing on the same subject which I learnt at
Gothenburg. In the harbour of that port there are a great number of strong wooden
piles, called dolphins, three or four feet in circumference, the lower parts of which
are sunk to a considerable depth in the mud, and firmly fixed in it, s0 that vyessels
may be moored to their tops. As these dolphins are annually frozen in, it is found
necessary to break the ice round them ; but sometimes this has been neglected, and
Mr, Harrisoxn, the English Vice-Consul, informed me, that on such occasions he has
known a great number of the piles drawn up together out of the mud six feet -per-
pendicular, a rise of the river having caused the ice to float up to that amount.

Mr. WesrBeck of Marstrand, to whom LI have already alluded, mentioned to me,
that having been formerly employed in the Swedish Diving Company for thirty years,
he had opportunities of witnessing the extraordinary power of ice to lift up from the
