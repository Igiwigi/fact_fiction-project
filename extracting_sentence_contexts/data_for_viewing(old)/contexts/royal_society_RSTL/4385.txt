constant, it follows that the oxygen has become relatively slower in transpiration at
the high temperature.

If oxygen deviates from a supposed normal rate at high temperatures, it cannot
necessarily coincide with that rate at any lower temperature, which is accidental,
Such as that of the atmosphere. But this influence of heat upon the transpiration
time of oxygen is, I believe, still sensible at the low temperature in question.

By increasing the time of oxygen, this influence of heat may be the cause of that
Slight deviation, s0 uniform in its amount, of the observed times of air and nitrogen
from their theoretical times, which was always remarked. I am disposed then to
look upon the slight inconstancy of transpiration rate obseryed in some gases at dif-
ferent temperatures, as a fact of the same class as the deviations from their theoretical
Specific gravities obseryed in a greater or less degree in the same substances, and to
those other points in which all the gaseous bodies we have to operate upon depart in
Some measure from the mechanical idea of a perfect gas.

The normal effect of temperature upon transpiration, as observed in air, varies I
find with the resistance of the capillary in a much higher degree than any other pro-
perty of transpiration ; the retardation from the same change of temperature being
much greater in a capillary of great than small resistance. 'The resistance of a capil-
lary such as M, which exhibits s0 exactly the law of densities, is insufficient to bring
out the full effect of temperature. With the fine tubes of the compound capil-
lary, on the other hand, the limit to the retarding influence of heat seems to be
reached. The retardation then appears to be simply in proportion to the expansion;
