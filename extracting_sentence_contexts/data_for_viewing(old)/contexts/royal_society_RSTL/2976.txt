much the shorter, as the object C is smaller and nearer to the eyes. Thus the object C
seen with both eyes becomes, as it were, transparent, according to the usual definition
of a transparent thing ; namely, that which hides nothing beyond it. But this cannot
happen when an object, whose breadth is bigger than that of the pupil, is viewed by
a single eye. 'The truth of this observation is therefore evident, because a painted
figure intercepts all the space behind its apparent place, 80 as to preclude the eyes
from the sight of every part of the imaginary ground behind it.‚Äù

Had Lroxarpo pa Vinci taken, instead of a sphere, a less simple figure for the
purpose of his illustration, a cube for instance, he would not only have observed that
the object obscured from each eye a different part of the more distant field of view,
but the fact would also perhaps have forced itself upon his attention, that the object
itself presented a different appearance to each eye. He failed to do this, and no $ub-
