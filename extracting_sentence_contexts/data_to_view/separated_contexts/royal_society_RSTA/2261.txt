(2) Zero readings will be less accurate because (a) the depression and recovery are
both larger than at lower temperatures, and (6) the individual observation and
not a point on a mean curve is taken. (3) Errors due to distillation are at a maximum. In view of these facts, observations were carried on until the distribution of the
results assumed a fairly symmetrical form, similar in general appearance to a Gaussian
distribution of errors. This involved from about twenty to fifty observations on each
thermometer. The results are shown in Table XI, which shows “ errors” of the
various mercury thermometers at the steam point, when the Bureau International
figures for the fundamental intervals are employed.
