The elements are larger—
instead of shallow, thick-walled cups, there are deep, well-moulded cups, lined with a
highly differentiated electric layer, and provided with a thick, dense, nucleated
cortex, in place of the thin sarcolemma-like investment found in R. radiata. Further,
the development is more rapid, the anterior ends of the original muscular fibres
instead of retaining their characteristic striations have been modified to form a thick,
non-nucleated, striated, or meandriform layer, similar to the middle layer in R. batis. Tn fact the muscular fibres have been so profoundly altered that without a knowledge
of the development of the cups in 2. circularis, it would be impossible to make out
that they were in any way related to muscular tissue. In &. fullonica a still further advance has been made towards the conditions found
in R. batis, and the other Skate having disc-like electrical elements. Evidence of
this advance is especially found in the alveolar layer, which in structure stands
midway between 22. circularis and R. batis—there being outgrowths larger and more
complex than in &. cireularis, but not so complex as in FR. batis.
