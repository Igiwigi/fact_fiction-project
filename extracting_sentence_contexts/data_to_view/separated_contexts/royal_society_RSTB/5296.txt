The material used for this investigation originated in a number of different ways. Some of the slides have been in the possession of the authors for many years. They
were stained with Heidenhainâ€™s hematoxylin after being mordanted with iron alum,
and despite the fact that a few are over twenty years old, they still show the cytological
structures in perfect detail. The majority of the slides, however, were freshly prepared
from material fixed in Bouin's fluid. With early infections in young roots, complete
sections of the root, cut transversely into pieces about 4 em. long, were used.
