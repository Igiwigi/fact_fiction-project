Our figured specimen is from mixed shelly sands dredged up at various spots between
Drontheim and the North Cape by Messrs. MAcANDREW and BarReve. It is very small,
and resembles what is usually found in nearly any muddy sand containing Foraminifera.

Dentalina communis is an extremely common variety wherever Nodosarian forms occur
in the clays of the Secondary Formations, but usually it is of small size. Tt is larger in
the Gault than in the Jurassic clays ; still larger in the Chalk-marl and Chalk, and in
the Maestricht Chalk, as well as in the Tertiary beds that yield Nodosarine. It is very
large in the Crag of Suffolk, and in the Subapennine 'Fertiaries. Older than the
Secondary deposits, however, it is found in the Permian limestones of England and
Germany.

It is common in the recent state from the Arctic Circle to the Line; in fact, geogra-
phically and geologically, it has a very large range. It occurs in many sandy shore-
deposits; but its favourite habitat is mud at 50-100 fathoms; and is continually met
with in the deepest sonndings, although never abundant there, and generally small.

Nodosaria (Dentalina) consobrina, D'Orbigny. Plate XVI. fig. 3 (North Atlantic).

'Two joints of Dentalina communis, subvar. consobrina, D'Orb. (For. Foss. Vien, pl. 2,
figs. 1-3); the chambers are longish and set on more squarely than in D. communis
proper; representing a passage into D. ovieula, D'Orb. (D. globifera, Batsch).

"This is small and rare at 1776 fathoms in the North Atlantic, lat. 52* 33', long. 21* 16'.
