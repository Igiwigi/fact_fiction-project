When
observations are made on plants at a fairly high temperature, the difference between
sleepers and non-sleepers comes out clearly.

bright light (not sunshine) gave with the hygroscope 25 to 30, while a control plant in duller light was at
12 to 10. Similar differences occur in 2. Ficaria, and doubtless in other species.

* This percentage is probably too high, since I was guided to some of the above plants by the wish
to test Leiraxn’s facts.
