Its walls eventually form the muscles of the first maxillae, as is already
seen in the 112-hours stage. It does not show a division into three parts as obtains in
the other coelomic cavities. In fact, it does not even develop a dorsal pouch. It
therefore corresponds largely to the ventral portion of the other coelomic cavities. Labial Coelomic Cavities (fig. 101, Plate 6)â€”The second maxillary or labial coelomic
cavities first appear in the 56-hours stage when they lie in the hollow of their
appendages.
