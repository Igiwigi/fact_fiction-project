He may never have heard of the eruption of 1718, or if he did so, may have
considered the evidence for it unsatisfactory. The anonymous writer of the account of the eruption of 1812 distinctly refers to
a previous eruption in the words, “ A century had now elapsed since the last convul-
sion of the mountain ” (see p. 463). The internal evidence, also, is very strongly in favour of Derror’s narrative
having been founded on fact. The first news to reach England was that in Barbados
the startling phenomenon of a rain of ashes had caused great alarm, and it had been
preceded by sounds like distant cannonading. Similar noises were heard all over the
Caribbean Sea from Antigua to Trinidad, The rain of dust had been heaviest near
St. Vincent and in Barbados.
