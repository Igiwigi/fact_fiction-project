It follows that the probabilistic character
of quantum predictions must hold in interpretations of QM or alternative theories of quantum
phenomena (such as Bohmian mechanics) that are classically causal. Thus, while in classical
physics, some theories are deterministic and others probabilistic or statistical, in quantum theory,
the behaviour of all systems considered, individual, no matter how elementary, can only be
treated probabilistically. This fact as such does not exclude the classically causal nature of the ultimate reality
responsible for quantum phenomena, thus making the recourse of probability only a practical
matter similarly to classical physics when it used probability. In RWR interpretations, however,
QM or OFT is not classically causal because the ultimate nature of reality responsible for quantum.
phenomena is assumed to be beyond a representation or conception. Classical causality would
imply at least a partial conception of this reality.
