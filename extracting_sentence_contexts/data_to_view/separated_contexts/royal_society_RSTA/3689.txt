structure theory. We then ran 160000 NVE trajectories on a large slab of diamond, and the
results are in reasonable agreement with experiment: they suggest that energy dissipation from
surface hotspots is complete within a few hundred femtoseconds, but that a small fraction
of CH3 does in fact undergo dissociation prior to the onset of thermal equilibrium. Second,
we developed and tested a general procedure to formulate and solve the energy-grained
master equation (EGME) for surface chemistry problems. The procedure we outline splits the
diamond slab into system and bath components, and then evaluates microcanonical transition-
state theory rate coefficients in the configuration space of the system atoms.
