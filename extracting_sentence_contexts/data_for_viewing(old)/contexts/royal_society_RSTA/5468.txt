In a letter to one of the authors, Sir Nevill Mott, then in his tenth decade, highlighted
the fact that the statement ‘... a metal conducts, and a non-metal doesn’t’ can be
true only at the absolute zero of temperature, T=0K. But, of course, experimental
studies of metals, non-metals and, indeed, the electronic and thermodynamic transition
between these canonical states of matter must always occur above T=0K, and,
in many important cases, for temperatures far above the absolute zero. Here, we
review the issues—theoretical and experimental—attendant on studies of the metal
to non-metal transition in doped semiconductors at temperatures close to absolute
zero (T =0.03K) and fluid chemical elements at temperatures far above absolute zero
(T > 1000 Kk).

We attempt to illustrate Mott’s insights for delving into such complex phenomena
and experimental systems, finding intuitively the dominant features of the science, and
developing a coherent picture of the different competing electronic processes. A
