In addition to the above-mentioned primary work, we
also present modest extensions of our published work on MCB-induced reduction of the strength
of developing hurricanes and the preservation of coral reefs. The studies outlined above have in common the MCB-induced reduction of sea surface : =
temperatures (SSTs) in selected regions. The fact that all three above-mentioned applications of yy
MCB involve reductions in SST does not indicate that other parameters do not play a significant 2
role. They unquestionably do—but they lay beyond the scope of this preliminary study. aes

The seeding areas covered in this earlier work ranged considerably from 100% of all suitable 72
maritime cloud regions [9-11] to the three areas containing the most extensive concentrations of : S
such clouds—off the West coasts of North and South America, and Africa [7,8,11]. These three aw
areas (combined) cover approximately 5% of the total oceanic area and were used in most of : =
the current computations outlined herein.
