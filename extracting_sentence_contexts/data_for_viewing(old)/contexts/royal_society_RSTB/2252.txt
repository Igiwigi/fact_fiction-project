disease, gives a still completer correspondence. Other clinical observers do not
describe the [Ind thoracic field. The correspondence between this field in May as
described by Hzap and MACKENZIE, is so close as not to indicate that Man’s plexus
is more prefixed than Macaque’s. It is true that one occasionally meets with
sensory roots and motor roots varying independently as regards pre and post fixture ;
but that is not the rule. I cannot, therefore, help suspecting that our text-books on
human anatomy may err in omitting the IInd thoracic nerve from the human
brachial plexus, although I think the above observations prove a certain degree of
prefixture in the prevailing type of human brachial plexus as compared with
Macaque’s—in this point resembling the Cat's plexus—as compared with Macacus,
Rabbit, Dog, and Rat. The fact that in Macacus the Ist thoracic does not, as it
does in Man, send usually a branch to join the IInd thoracic, points in the direction
of slight prefixture in Man, as does the muscular analysis. But Heav’s and
Mackenzie's observations of the area of the IInd thoracic in man seem to prove
that the amount of his prefixture is after all small. It is certainly smaller in this
region than in the lumbo-sacral, where, as I have shown in my previous papers, that
both in regard to muscle and skin the human lies one whole segment in front of
(i.e., prefixed in comparison with) the Macaque type. ;

As just mentioned, the topography of certain skin-areas of painfulness and
hyperalgesia, explicable by reference from visceral disease, has been investigated by
Heap, and shown by him to exhibit a segmental arrangement. This segmental
scheme is, broadly taken, notably similar to that of the spinal root-fields as exhibited
