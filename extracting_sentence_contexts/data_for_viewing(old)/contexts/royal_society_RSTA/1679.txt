should be reserved for scientific experiments and telescopes, while the majority of the water-
bearing cold traps should be reserved for mining. Similarly, a powerful radio transmitter on a
new lander could interfere with instruments on a nearby, emplaced lander (as in our example of
the Peaks of Eternal Light [3]). In this case, the exclusion zone may be defined by the horizon,
which is about 2.5 km away for a typical human eye height (1.7 m) [57], but is farther away for
objects at higher elevations, particularly on a mountain peak or a crater rim.

Each of these cases would constitute harmful interference. It is important to notice that they
also apply ona scale comparable with many of the concentrated resources detailed in §2.

Exclusion zones for new landers do not preclude the exploitation of a resource within that zone
by another party. They only complicate the process. The new lander can deploy a rover to go over
to the prime site. In fact, PTScientists planned to do this for their first lunar lander mission. Their
rover had only a small fraction of the mass of the lander, and so would have carried far more
limited equipment. As this will likely be generally true of rovers, the ability to engage in resource
utilization by the later arrival will be significantly hampered.

The intention of PTScientists was to land a few kilometres from the Apollo 17 site in the Taurus-
Littrow valley. Their rover would then go over to the site and take pictures. PTScientists said
that they will treat the site ‘like a cathedral’ [58], and they worked with ‘For All Moonkind Inc.’
[44] and with NASA to preserve the site. (The post-reorganization PTS have not said if they are
continuing with a landing near to Apollo 17.) Moon Express and Astrobotic have also announced
that they will comply with the NASA recommendations regarding lunar heritage sites [41]. The
requirement for US Federal Aviation Authority approval for payloads adds pressure to comply
