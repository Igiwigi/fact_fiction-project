Branching. Figure 2 illustrates the branching in the branches of the Ist order. The
stages up to the formation of the joint-trace-bar are similar to those described in the
petiole, except for the fact that in the former the outer ends of the joint-trace-bar carry
only one protoxylem instead of two (figure 2F, G; cf. figures 10, 11, plate 1), so that when
the joint-trace-bar divides by equal dichotomy into two daughter steles each daughter
stele possesses three protoxylems instead of four (cf. petiole) and the daughter steles
become tetrarch only just before they enter into branches of the IInd order. This 1s
accomplished by the bifurcation of the protoxylem at the outer end of each daughter
stele, so that a protoxylem occupies each corner of the quadrangular xylem mass. ‘The
orientation of the two daughter steles, remains parallel to that of the parent stele. Sometimes the two branches of the IInd order remain fused at the base, but they soon
separate and diverge from each other. ‘The branches of the [Ind order thus given out
possess a tetrarch stele, but the arms of the xylem lobes are feebly developed.
