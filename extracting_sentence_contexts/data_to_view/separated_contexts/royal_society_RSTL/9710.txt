Whether the resulb here is due to any reaction with the
as8ociated mineral manures, or to some accidental difference in the otherwise duplicate
plot, i is not easy to 8ay; but it may be remarked, in passing, that the increased
amount of nitrogen taken up corresponded very closely with that contained in the

sawdust.
dy During the next 14 years the relations are strikingly reversed in every particular. D

SY There is an average of nearly one-fourth less hay produced, and of more than one-
5 fourth less nitrogen and mineral matter taken up, on plot 8 without, than on plot 7 with
> potass. In fact, the falling off in amount of produce on the exclusion of potass from
the manure was very great. The number of species has remained about the same on
L the two plots. The percentage by weight, in the total produce, of gramineous species
= was, during the earlier of the 14 years, and has been on the average, greater in the
= produce of plot 8 without potass, but, as already referred to, it has increased on plot 7
Z in the later years.
