not only the strongest apodeme belonging to its own segment but has brought into its

the smaller apodeme belonging to the evanescent segment in front of it. The
labium, being for the most part a mere carrier of the silk gland aperture (in Pieris) or
a more or less passive organ bounding the posterior side of the mouth, is provided with

no special apodemes but the gland is well developed. Antennary and maxillary invagina-
tions are well developed and devoted to forming the tentorium.

Were it not for the fact that Nenson (1915) has described a cephalic spiracle in Apis,
one would like to adopt the tentorium-spiracle homology and point out the common
association of glands with spiracles in the main body region. SNop@Rass (1928), in an
extensive treatise on the morphology of the insect head, points out that the anterior
tentorial arms arise in front of the mandibles, while the posterior arms originate from
depressions in the post-occipital suture. This is the adult condition, but if the post-
occipital suture is, as he supposes, an intersegmental boundary between maxillary and
labial segments, his description coincides in a remarkable degree with that of the
development given above.
