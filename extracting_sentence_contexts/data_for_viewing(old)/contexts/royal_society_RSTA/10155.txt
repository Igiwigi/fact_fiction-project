was made with the current reversed, and the whole repeated on the other suspended
coil. In neither case could any change in the rest-point be detected. Experiments
were also made by bringing masses of iron in proximity to the balance when the
suspended coils were carrying their normal current. ‘The effects of these masses were
much smaller than expected ; in fact, the iron had to be placed very near a current-
carrying coil to produce any observable change on the rest-point. It may, therefore,
be concluded that there can be no appreciable error in the balance due to magnetism
or diamagnetism of the phosphor-bronze support.

Magnetic tests on marble were made at the Central Technical College in 1897,
using the large marble cylinder employed in the Lorenz apparatus constructed by
Messrs. Natper Bros. & Co. for the McGill University, Montreal.* Its permeability
differed from that of air by an amount too small to be detected.t This fact, together
with the high specific resistance of marble, decided the material to be used for the
cylinders of the proposed current weigher.

All the marble used in the fixed and suspended cylinders of the ampere balance
was tested at the National Physical Laboratory, when received from the merchants,
by observing the swing (if any) of a galvanometer in the secondary circuit of a pair of
coils when the marble was quickly inserted as a core, the current in the primary
circuit being kept quite constant. The primary coil had 1000 turns of No. 32 S.W.G.
copper wire, and the secondary 10,000 turns of No. 42 8.W.G. With a current of
0°5 ampere in the primary the arrangement was extremely sensitive, as a change in
the primary current of 1 part in 10,000 produced a swing of 5:4 millims. The scale
could be read to 0°2 millim., so that a change of flux of 1 part in 270,000 could be
