These ova,
80 far as I have observed, never produce embryos. Segmentation is arrested in 8ome
at the very commencement (Plate XIV. fig. 11), in others it goes on to the second or
crucial fissure, and in a very few cases may proceed somewhat further (fig. 12), but is
never completed to granulation of the yelk. This, I think, is a fact which deserves
some consideration with reference to the formation of the embryo. Set F. March 22, 1850.â€”Temperature of the room at the time of the experiment
was 48*5 Fanr., and that of the water employed 46*5 Fanr.
