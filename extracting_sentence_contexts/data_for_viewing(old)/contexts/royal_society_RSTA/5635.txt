on 92 d_P"=0 while ond(x,92) =5 P}' =0. (3.24¢)

First, observe that the function pre is a harmonic function satisfying the homogeneous Dirichlet
boundary condition on d(x,@@) =6 and the Neumann boundary condition:
agPr” =y(u"-7P onde.
Therefore, as in the proof of proposition 3.6, one has, by elliptic Hélder regularity theory
(cf. chapter 3 of [2] chapter 6 or more precisely theorem 3.4.1 and theorem 4.5.1 of [1]), the estimate
b
[Pp Ico (2) < Clu" ® u")||coa¢a)- (3.25)

Denoting by (—Agn)~! the solution operator of the boundary value problem (3.24c), which is
well defined (due in particular to the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition on d(x, 092) = 5).
The remaining estimate for Pi is more subtle. A key point in the proof relies on the fact that
the right-hand side of equation (3.24c) does not involve any second-order derivative terms with
respect to s.

Since the problem is considered in the V3 M @, i.e. in the ‘slab’ (s,@) € (0,5)) x (R/(LZ)), one
introduces the Green function, k, associated with (—Agn)~! according to the formula:

(oan) 60)=| (s,6;5!,0°)f(6",6"yJ(s,6" dso’. (3.26)
(0,5) x(R/(LZ))

Applying the representation (3.26) to equation (3.24c), one obtains pt as the sum of three terms:
PY =h+b+h. (3.27)
