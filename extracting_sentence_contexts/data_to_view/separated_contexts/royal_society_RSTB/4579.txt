But the air-bladder
has apparently been too late in its disappearance ; when the dorsal fin becomes
attached to the skull this has already been flexed to the right anteriorly. The base
of the dorsal fin is also to the right of the mean longitudinal plane, which again may
be referred to the influence of the air-bladder, as in the ease of the Rhomboids. How
near this form comes to the normal fish is shown by the fact that the left half of the
skull remains normal. In contrast to the above and in confirmation of this view regarding the part played
by the air-bladder, we have the Solea forms, in which the air-badder is more or less
on the right side. A possible explanation for the transference of the air-bladder to
the right side in these forms will be given later, meantime it has to be noted that
this position accentuates the left flexure caused by the coil of the gut.
