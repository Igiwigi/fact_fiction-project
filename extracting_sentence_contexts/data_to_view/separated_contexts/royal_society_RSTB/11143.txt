To validate the suit-
ability of our 4a-based FP-assay for fragment screening, we
tested fragments of SirReal2 (2a) to assess their potency to
compete with 4a for Sirt2 binding. As expected, fragments
of 2a prevented our TAMRA-labelled probe (4a) from bind-
ing to Sirt2 (figure 5f). In accordance with the fact that
methylation of the pyrimidine moiety in positions 4 and 6
is beneficial for binding to Sirt2 [55], we noted here that the
dimethylated fragment (4,6-DM-2-MTP) provokes a signifi-
cant decrease in 4a binding to Sirt2 as compared with the
fragment without methyl groups (2-MTP). No effect was
observed for nicotinamide (NA), which was used as a nega-
tive control because the SirReals were previously shown not
to be bound to the NA-binding site of Sirt2 [55]. Additional
information on assay conditions and procedure can be
found in the electronic supplementary material.

(c) Assay validation

To interrogate the suitability of both above-described assays
for orthogonal Sirt2 inhibitor screening, we tested a series
of known sirtuin modulators.
