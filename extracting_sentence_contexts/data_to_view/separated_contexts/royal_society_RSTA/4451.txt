Nevertheless, it is clear that other values of t could provide additional information. It has been
shown recently that this parameter is strongly related, if it is relevant, to the intrinsic time scales
of the system under analysis [43-45]. The local sensitivity of Fisher information measure for discrete PDFs is reflected in the fact
that the specific ‘i ordering’ of the discrete values p; must be seriously taken into account in
evaluating the sum in equation (3.5) [18,19]. The pertinent numerator can be regarded as a kind
of ‘distance’ between two contiguous probabilities. Thus, a different ordering of the pertinent
summands would lead to a different Fisher information value.
