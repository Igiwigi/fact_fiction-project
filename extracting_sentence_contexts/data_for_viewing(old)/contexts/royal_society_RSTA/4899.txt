(a) Energy and heating

In order to show that the shock heating is not a numerical artefact, we investigate the impact of
increasing the number of grid cells—the colour of the plot line indicates the spatial resolution
(figure 2). There is little difference in the amount of energy released by the magnetic field, which
indicates that the energy release is entirely defined by the nature of the unstable equilibrium.
The two most highly resolved simulations achieve instability about 20f, earlier than the low-
resolution case. Numerical dissipation (Egjs = Etot(t)/Etot(0) — 1, where Etot = W + Exin + Eint) is
lowest for the highest resolution case and is just under 0.5%. The amount of Ohmic heating
reduces markedly with increasing resolution. Figure 3a shows the ratio of the total shock heating
to the total Ohmic heating as a function of time. As 6x is decreased, the critical current threshold
rises (see equation (3.17)) and the opportunities for anomalous resistivity are much reduced. This
relationship outweighs the fact that better resolved currents are typically higher (figure 3b).
What is significant about these results is that our attempts to maximize Ohmic dissipation by
using a locally defined current threshold have instead confirmed the dominance of shock heating.
Between the 128? x 256 and 256* x 512 simulations, the shock heating increases by about 10%;
however, a further increase in spatial resolution leaves the level of shock heating more or less
