Like pure oxygen, it undergoes a diminution of volume ; but the
operation is more quickly terminated and the contraction is less than with that gas
alone, If, after the passage of the discharge, the vessel be set aside for some hours, the
contraction will be found to augment ; and if the gaseous mixture be now again exposed
to the action of the discharge, a further contraction will take place. On the other
hand, heat destroys a portion only of the contraction at first produced. All these
facts are easily explained from the simultaneous formation of ozone and one of the
higher oxides of nitrogen, and the marked influence of the latter, when formed, in
arresting the formation of the former. 'To the same cause we have sncceeded in
referring an apparently anomalous state of oxygen, produced by passing a stream of
strong electrical sparks, for ome minutes, through that gas containing a trace of nitrogen. The oxygen becomes by this treatment incapable of contracting or of changing into
ozone under the action of the silent discharge, and only recovers its usual condition by
exposure to heat or by standing for some hours.
