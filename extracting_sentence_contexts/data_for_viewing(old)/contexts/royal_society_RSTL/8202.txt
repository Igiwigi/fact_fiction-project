I find in recent Tycopodiacew ; consequently in a third memoir, recently laid before the Royal Society, T have
designated the middle bark (7) of this paper the parenchymatons layer. The outer bark (i and &) T have termed
the prosenchymatons layer, and what I have called the epidermal (7), I now designate the subepidermal layer.
The detailed reasons for employing these terms will be given in the memoir referred to, meanwhile they may be
applied to the specimens under consideration. In the new Halonia, the conical mammilliform tubercles
evidently projected entirely through the prosenchymatous layer, and through a great part of the subepidermal
one, a thin expansion of the latter alone appearing to invest the apex of the tubercle; and oyen here there is
a small central mucro which. exhibits every indication that it accompanied something which projected entirely

Having thus reviewed all the principal facts that have come under my personal
obseryation, and T have almost entirely confined myself to such, it now remains to be
een what general conclusions can be drawn from them. We began with a Lepidoden-
droid plant, Z. s21aginoides, in which we found the medullary axis largely occupied by
a great number of scalariform vessels ; but we saw that these were not arranged in
radiating order, neither did they give off any vascular bundles to the leaves. These
bundles were confined to the inner surface of a very narrow, but nevertheless distinet,
enclosing circle of somewhat smaller vessels, between which, and passing radially out-
wards, were vertically disposed rows of cells, which I believe to be true representatives
of medullary rays, whilst the thin cylinder through which they pass'is the woody zone
separating medullary from cortical structures. The bark we found to be thick, consisting
of varying elements of parenchyma and prosenchyma, but chiefly the latter ; and near
the outer surface we discovered a layer of prosenchyma, where the cells are 80 elon-
