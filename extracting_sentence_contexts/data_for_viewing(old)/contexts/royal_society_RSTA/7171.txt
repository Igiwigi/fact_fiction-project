* The case of several common zeros is considered in §§5 (a) and (c).


EVALUATION OF ZEROS OF HIGH-DEGREE POLYNOMIALS 401

(ii) If the available value of q is insufficiently accurate to resolve the ambiguities in
equation (5-2), then we can revert to the last polynomial of the sequence {U,(q)} in which
no considerable cancellation has occurred, and obtain a better value of ¢g by iteration
(see § 7), since g must be a zero of this polynomial. Using the more accurate value we can
then proceed as in (i).

(iii) Finally, the cancellation in one of the polynomials, say U,_,(q), may be so severe
that the common factor process cannot be continued. This apparent failure may in fact
be turned to considerable advantage, for if the polynomial U,(q) (which is of degree less
than half that of f(x)) is solved numerically, each real or complex zero q will correspond to
an approximate quadratic factor x?—grx-+-7? of f(x), and we can quickly obtain* 2k zeros
of ftx).

a Summarizing, if we regard methods I, II and III merely as means of resolving the
‘ambiguities j in the formula (5-2), then they are of equivalent accuracy. As a corollary, it is
“pften possible to apply them keeping comparatively few figures in the calculations and yet
till obtain as many decimals in g at the finish as there are significant figures in r.
