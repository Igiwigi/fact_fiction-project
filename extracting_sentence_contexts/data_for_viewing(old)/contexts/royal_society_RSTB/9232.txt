as such, and proposed sexual selection as the mechanism
behind it.

Finally, a fourth point is that in order to confer a selec-
tive advantage, a trait or behaviour need not be essential for
survival, but need only confer a slightly improved likelihood
of survival to procreation, and/or a greater rate of procrea-
tion—thus perpetuating and increasing the frequency of that
trait or behaviour—than would otherwise be the case. There
is thus no justification for the common observation that
music could hardly be a product of evolution by selection as
it is hardly essential for survival. The former observation
does not in fact follow from the latter. Furthermore, it does
not rule out the possibility that various of the abilities that
are used in musical activities may have been initially selectively
favoured as a consequence of their fulfilment of other purposes
(e.g. interpersonal communication and the establishment of
interpersonal relationships), and that musical practices may
have developed within the context of those uses; musical beha-
viours have the potential to fulfil some of those same purposes,
or other purposes, potentially in even more effective ways. The
co-use of these underlying abilities could lead to increasing
interdependence between them, uniting them functionally in
this new behavioural system, and potentially leading to further
selective processes acting upon those underlying abilities and
