of the crystal to that which it had before. If now the magnet were reinvigorated
by the electric current, the crystal instantly spun round and took a magnetic state
in the first or original direction. The crystals could in fact become magnetized in
any direction, but there was one direction in which they could be magnetized with a
facility and force greater than in any other. From the appearances I am inclined to
refer this to the crystalline condition, but it may be due to an irregular diffusion of
iron in the masses of titanium. The crystals were too small for me.
