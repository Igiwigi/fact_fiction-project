seen to terminate in fine arborisations (Plate 49, fig. 9).

Here and there they pass for a short distance into the enamel, apparently in the
interprismatic spaces, where they terminate in small bulbous enlargements.

Where the so-called “spindles” are present in the enamel, especially at the apices”
of the cusps, fine winding fibres are sometimes seen within them, but these spindles
do not in my preparations appear to contain definite nerve-end organs as described by
Romer (4). It is impossible, however, to speak with certainty on this point, and the
spindles being comparatively infrequent, a great many teeth should be prepared in
this manner to decide the question. From tHe preparations I have made, however,
one would be inclined to consider the penetration of these bodies by nerve fibres more
as due to the fact that nerve fibres in the tubes would be likely to penetrate into any
open space with which the tubes communicate than as constituting definite nerve-end
organs. The refraction in these spindles greatly interferes with accurate observation
even in thin sections. It is considered by many that the spindles are interprismatic
spaces which have remained uncalcified, and my own observations on the enamel of
marsupials appear to confirm this interpretation of their nature (5a).

Minute beads or enlargements are seen upon the neurofibrils in the tubes in many
places, and in some, under high magnification, delicate threads are seen to be continued
from these enlargements into the finer divisions of the dentinal tubes.

In Plate 49, fig. 6, two dentinal tubes are shown, at a short distance from their
origin in the pulp; in which these nodes are of an angular shape.
