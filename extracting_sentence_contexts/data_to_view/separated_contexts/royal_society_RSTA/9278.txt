It is to be
= remembered that the data on which we depend are the positions of the spectra of the
various faces. Let us now proceed to consider how we may determine the arrangement of the
atoms about the representative point. We now work on an entirely different plan,
building in fact on a determination of the relative intensities of-the reflections of
different order and different sets of planes. As has already been said, measurements
of this kind are much more difficult than measurements of position ; and moreover
their exact interpretation has been by no means clear. But in many cases we already
know so much from considerations of crystal symmetry, and from measurements of
