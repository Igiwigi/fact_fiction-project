variants are evident in all regions. Blips in September and March correspond to low case numbers and may be artefacts. (Online

and produces estimates of subsequent hospitalizations, deaths and recoveries. It executes within

The WSS code generates R-numbers at the regional level (figure 6). The statistics for the
four UK nations and nine English regions are sufficiently good to produce stable independent
estimates at that resolution, and are consistent with the SPI-M published values (subject to 16-
day lags). We also evaluated R at the level of individual health boards in Scotland. These values
showed plausible trends, except for the smallest boards. The issue there is due to not only
insufficent data, but also the fact that rural values may be driven by incomers as already discussed
in §1b. Consequently, case data may not be indicative of community transmission rates in those
areas. The local authority regions in England also often have too-small numbers for accurate
evaluation, although a combination of large R and high case numbers can be indicative of local
hotspots or superspreading events.

The data can also be sliced to provide a growth-rate breakdown by age group (figure 7).
Breakdown by age has a similar problem to that for regions because the case data refer to
infectees, not infectors—and generally infectors are in a different age group from infectees [21].
This intergenerational mixing is particularly true for families, hospitals and care-home situations.
Specifically, when case numbers are unevenly distributed across age groups, the ‘R-numbers’
ascribed to older age groups do not imply that these people are responsible for infection.
