In fact. the phenomenon is very common,
and admitted on all hands. A The conclusion which Mr. HoykiNs has drawn from these facts is unavoidable ; the
glaciers must have s/idden over the rocks on which such traces are left. 'To an eye a
little practised in those matters, the precise limits reached by the ancient glaciers are
perfectly visible. The junction of the rounded and abraded portions of the mountains,
with those portions which in ancient times rose over the then existing ice, is per-
fectly distinct ; and I should say in the valley of the Aar reaches to a height of more
than a thousand feet above the present bed of the river.
