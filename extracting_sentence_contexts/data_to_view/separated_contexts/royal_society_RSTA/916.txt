one begins to look experimentally for bistability once a model has suggested the possibility of 73
its occurrence. What is striking, however, is the variety of biological contexts in which bistability 7S
has been invoked, mostly in theoretical models. In ยง2 we have mentioned more than a dozen 7g
examples; the list is far from being exhaustive, and in fact is rapidly growing. However, the field ,
in which bistability appears to play major roles is definitely cell fate specification, which process is
of key importance for successful embryonic development. A recent example studied theoretically
and experimentally pertains to the preadipocyte-to-adipocyte conversion in fat cell differentiation
[229,230].
