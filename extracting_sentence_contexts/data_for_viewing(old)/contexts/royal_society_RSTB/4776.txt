338 DR. W. G. RIDEWOOD ON THE CALCIFICATION OF THE

calcification of the centra as seen in transverse section are very striking and may
prove to be of some taxonomic value, Hassx did not succeed in expressing and
co-ordinating the facts in a scheme that adequately meets the requirements of the
ease. (See Views of Later Authors, p. 344.)

Fic. 3—Hassr’s diagrams of cyclospondylous (1), tectospondylous (2), and asterospondylous (3)
vertebre, representing transverse sections of anterior caudal vertebrie of the three types, cut midway
between the anterior and posterior ends of the centrum,

A, radiating lamelle characteristic of asterospondylous vertebr ; C, remains of the notochord ;
D, primary double-cone calcification of the middle-zone cartilage; E, membrana elastica externa,
the outer limit of the notochordal sheath ; H, hemal arch ; N, neural arch ; T, one of the concentric
lamelle characteristic of tectospondylous vertebra, The cartilage next internal to the ring D is
inner-zone cartilage, that between the rings D and E is outer-zone cartilage. Copied from Hassr
(15, A, pp. 41, 44, 48).
