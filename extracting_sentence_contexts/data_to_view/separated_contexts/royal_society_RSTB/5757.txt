In
specimen 500 the induced plate occupies a position which would be well out at the edge
of the area pellucida, and unless the normal movements were not only hindered but
actually reversed, the presumptive neural tissue could not have reached this situation. In case 479, the induced folds of the upper ectoderm stretch out anterior to the head
of the normal embryo and probably pass into ectoderm which originally overlay the
yolk sac endoderm ; it is very difficult to see how presumptive neural tissue could have
reached this anterior position. Moreover, it is known from other experiments, in which
the primitive streak, after injury, forms a complete medullary plate, that non-presump-
tive neural ectoderm can, in fact, be caused to form nervous tissue at this stage (see
later). It will be remembered that, according to WerzeL and GRAPER, there are two main form-
building movements going on in the middle and later primitive streak stages, that is,
subsequent to the stage at which these experiments were made. First, there is a
movement of material from the sides towards the primitive streak, where the material
becomes invaginated to form mesoderm.
