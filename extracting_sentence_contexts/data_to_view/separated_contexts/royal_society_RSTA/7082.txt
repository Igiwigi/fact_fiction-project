AA denoting an incremental quantity of the type of A. So
2Ae, — Ae, — Ae, = $AA(2, —f2—fs)»
and hence, according to (3),
Ae, = Ad{p, —3(bo+ps)}p --- etc. (9)

That is to say, as regards the plastic part of the distortion the (stress)-(incremental strain) relations
have normal forms, the effective values of Young’s modulus and of Poisson’s ratio being 1/AA and }
respectively. The total strains associated with given stresses are, according to §3 (ii), the sums of these
plastic and of normal elastic components, so that (e.g.) the total strain

€ =e +@)5
and the fact that (2) relates to total, (9) to incremental strains, both expressible in terms of

total stresses, entails a serious complication of the formal problem. Combined, (2) and (9)
yield three equations of the type

Ae, = tbh — (Ape + Aps)} + Ad thi 2 (b2+Ps)}- (10)
These are the basis of our solutions. Systems of plane strain and of plane stress. (1) The criterion of plasticity
