He called this paired, or unpaired piece, the
eparcuale proatlantis. A little consideration shows that this piece is the neural spine
(eparcualia in Briuu’s and ALerecu?’s nomenclature) of the atlas itself, not of the
proatlas, which latter we know to have joined the cranium. It is surprising that not
one of ALBRECHT’s school has seen this fallacy, all the more because ALBRECHT had
laid stress upon the fact that the whole neurapophysis consists originally of a
hypareuale (my basidorsal proper) and of an eparcuale (my supradorsal), while, in
addition to these, there occur spinal epiphyses even in Reptiles (cf Lit. No. 9). If the piece in question were the eparcuale of the proatlas, the atlas itself would
be devoid of its eparcuale.
