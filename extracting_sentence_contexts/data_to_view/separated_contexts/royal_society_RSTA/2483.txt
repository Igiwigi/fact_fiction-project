The erection in 1892
of a new upper story to the Observatory, with iron girders, produced irregularities
on several days, which could not be satisfactorily dealt with. There were various
other discontinuities associated with movement of iron in the building, or with
changes of sensitiveness in the vertical foree magnetograph, which rendered the
omission of certain days expedient. But, everything considered, the number of days’
trace which could not be utilised was wonderfully small, a fact reflecting credit on
the staff, especially Mr. T. W. Baker, who had charge of the magnetic instruments
during the whole period concerned. It was judged important to have a complete set
of values of the absolute daily range (maximum less minimum) during the period. The loss of a good many hours’ trace necessarily introduces some uncertainty into the
daily range, because one at least of the extreme values might fall during the time
lost ; but in many cases one can be reasonably sure that the range deduced from the
part of the trace that is complete is the full range, or at least very approximately so.
