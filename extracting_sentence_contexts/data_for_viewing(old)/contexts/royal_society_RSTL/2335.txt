the large plate being very considerable in respect of the capacity of the smaller one.
We may, however, avoid the discrepancies by means of two or three small plates, pre-
cisely equal, 80 as to place each in snccession on the larger one.

(r.) Two plane conductors being alternately connected with the electrometer, whose
areas and perimeters were, in one, double of the other respectively, the intensity
of a given quantity, when disposed on them, was, according to the general law (16.),
in an inverse ratio of the square of the surface. This law, however, did not obtain
when the area only was double, without regard to the perimeter. Thus, in two
circular plates or parallelograms, in which the area of one plate, was double of the
other, the lengths of the latter being in the ratio of 2 : 1, the respective intensities
were found to be very nearly in an invyerse ratio of the areas; a somewhat remarkable
fact.

58. We may conclude from these phenomena, that the intensity does not vary in
an inverse ratio of the square of the surface, according to the general law (16.), ex-
cept when the areas are 80 disposed ; that the whole perimeter of the various plates,
is as the respective surfaces ; a result which applies also to cylindrical conductors, the
electrical capacities of these being the same as the plane areas, into which we may
conceive them to be expanded (54.).

59. The curious fact, that the capacity of a sphere or cylinder is the same as that
of the plane area into which it may be supposed to be rectified, seems to afford some
new views in electricity. We find in the case of electricity accumulated on a hollow
sphere, that a conducting substance, insulated and placed entirely within the sphere,
