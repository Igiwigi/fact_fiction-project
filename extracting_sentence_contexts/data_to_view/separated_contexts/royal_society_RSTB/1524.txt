Branprorp (No. 1) states for the genus Macacus that the period of gestation is
about seven months, and that the gestation of M. nemestrinus has been ascertained
to be seven months and twenty days, but he gives no reference to the source from
whence he got his information. The account Dr. ArrcHison gives me of M. rhesus, at Simla, deals only generally
with the breeding season and the time of bearing young ; but, from his observations, it
would seem to be not improbable that the gestation of this animal occupies consider-
ably more than seven months’ time. The fact that there is a definite breeding season for these animals, if it be true (as [
cannot but think it is), conveys of course no proof that each female breeds each year. The only evidence which I have to record which bears on this point, is the
fact that menstruation undoubtedly occurs while the mother is nursing her young. I have noted for three months the occurrence of yery regular menstrual periods in
the case of a specimen of M. cynomolgus, which was nursing a young one at the time.
