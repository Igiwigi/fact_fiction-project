Figure 2. Spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) transplant assay. The functional analysis of SSCs is a retrospective assay of sperma-
togenic function. In this example, cells are isolated from a /acZ donor mouse testis and digested to produce a single cell
suspension. Cells can then be maintained in culture or injected into the testes of an infertile recipient mouse. Recipient
testes are typically analysed two to three months after transplantation for donor spermatogenesis (blue colonies in this
example). A typical recipient testis is shown with blue colonies of donor-derived spermatogenesis (scale bar, 2 mm).

each colony arises from the clonogenic proliferation that recognizes a cell surface antigen. Marker* and
