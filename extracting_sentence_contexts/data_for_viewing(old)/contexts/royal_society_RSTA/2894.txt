Figure 25. (a) The indentation force-time history from tests with three different indentation speeds and presumably the
same thickness, 29 cm (the reference Sodhi et al. [26] does not very well identify each test) [26]. (b) The measured ice pressure
distribution in two tests together with the indentation force—time history (ice thickness 29 cm) [26]. (c) A close-up of the force—
time history from an indentation test reported in Sodhi et a/. [28], obtained as described by Sodhi (D. Sodhi 2018, personal
communication). (d) Maximum local and global ice pressure from tests with low and high indentation speeds. Here ‘local’ refers
to the tactile sensor measurements and ‘global’ to the average pressure.

It is also noteworthy that the pressures measured with the tactile sensors (small active area)
are much higher with higher indentation speeds than with lower ones. This should be contrasted
with the fact that the average (global?) ice pressure on the nominal area is higher at the lower
indentation speeds. This is demonstrated in figure 25d. The observation on local and global
