*This is a correct recollection of Ewald Weibel. The conversation was
at Weibel’s house during a meeting between Ewald as President and
D.N. as Secretary-General of the International Union of Physiological
Sciences (IUPS). Ewald told the story through guffaws of laughter. It
is very likely that Silvio and Ewald shared this story together.
“This story is true. Silvio asked Otto whether D.N. had been given
enough time. Otto simply said ‘Denis will do it, you'll see.’ D.N.
no longer lectures at that speed!

“This is a correct memory. Silvio told D.N. that Alan provided all his
mathematics while he was working in Cambridge.

SThis is a factual recollection. The visit took place in January 1976.
