We suggest that malvin forms a more stable compound with the flavonol
derivative than does petunin and that where flavonols are present the malvin, relatively to petunin,
is protected from destruction, This is confirmed experimentally by the observed greater effect of
co-pigments on malvin as compared with petunin. R. ROBINSON ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF ANTHOCYANINS 155

are analogous to the Dazzler forms of Primula sinensis. This is in fact known to be so
in Papaver Rhoeas (Scott-Moncrieff 1936). Therefore, subject to certain assumptions, the only conclusion which can be drawn
from the evidence of mixed anthocyanidin derivatives is that cyanidin is the antho-
cyanidin whose synthesis in the plant involves at least one stage less than that of either
pelargonidin or delphinidin (scheme C). LEucO-ANTHOCYANINS
