They differed from the corresponding hybrid
made with Hchinus in being much smaller. More than fifty experiments were also made in July with Arbacia pustuosa. It
was hoped that this species might prove free from the disadvantages associated with
Spherechinus granularis, and it has several points in its favour, the chief of which
are a very well-marked skeleton, and the fact that when ripe, abundant eggs and
sperm are shed by simple pressure of the thumb on the mouth of the urchin, Eggs
or sperm can, therefore, be obtained from the same urchin at different times and so
the sexual cells which have been kept or otherwise treated can be compared with
fresh ones. Eggs of Spherechinus, Echinus and Strongylocentrotus all gave a small proportion
of blastulee when treated in July with Arbacia sperm, but no plutei were reared. Of
the converse crosses, the only satisfactory plutei were obtained from Arbacia 9 x
Spherechinus  , which closely resembled pure-bred Arbacia larvae, but were smaller
and less regular.
