which is ascribed to the latter, namely, that of imbibing moisture and 80 expelling th
filiform spermatozoa, may also perhaps belong to the former. Nevertheless one cannot,
but be struck with the fact, that they exactly resemble in shape the elliptic bodies which
are found in the testis and spermatheca of Chelifer, and which cannot have any 8weh
function. In the present species, however, as above mentioned, the elliptic vesicles do
not appear to find their way into the spermathecw. x

M. Fapne, to whose excellent paper I have already 80 often alluded, made, with
reference to some Chilopods, the very curious observation that the male spins a sort of
nest. or rather web of silk, and deposits in the middle a drop of semen, He has not
actually observed that the genus Cryptops has this extraordinary habit, but he thinks it
probable. From the fact that the two spermatheee of the female Oryptops generally
contain spermatozoa, it would seem that the females must, have the scarcely less remark»
able instinct to visit these nests, and in some manner absorb the contents into their
vagina.

I find much difficulty in imagining how, under Mr. Darw1N's theory, such habits ag
these can have originated. It is easy enough to understand how they can continue
when they have once existed long enough to harden into an instinct; but I do not under-
sﬆtand how they can have begun. It may be hoped, however, that we shall find among
other Myriapods some species with less abnormal habits, or that in some other manner
new light may be thrown on the matter.
