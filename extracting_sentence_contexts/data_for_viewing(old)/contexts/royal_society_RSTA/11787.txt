‘Shen multiplied by a fractional power of the atomic volume, A/D, is a constant for
ill metals, E (A/D)* = 181 x 10%. The divergencies shown by several metals from
‘Bhis mean value arise from the fact that the presence of small amounts of impurity
makes a great difference in their elasticity.

SuTHERLAND‘ finds a close relation between the atomic volume and the rigidity
.ef metals, and considers that this rigidity is “in its essence a kinetic phenomenon
‘almost as simple in character as the elasticity of perfect gases.”

S$, Professor FrssENDEN,** moreover, has urged that the cohesion of metals is
“proportional to some power of the atomic volume, and he considers that the rigidity
fxaries as the fifth power of the distance of the centre of the atoms, or as (atomic
=olume)"*. These facts are given merely to show that the atomic volume of the
@aded element is very important.

gy Some years ago, one of us purified gold with great care and alloyed seventeen
“Separate portions of it with foreign elements, in quantities which were in all cases
aoe to 0°2 per cent., and from each sample of this alloyed gold, bars were cast
88 millims. long by 7°5 millims. wide by 5:2 millims. thick. The metal was in each
ease poured into a closed iron mould heated to about 500°; the cooling was therefore
not very rapidly effected. The tensile strength, elongation, and reduction of sectional
