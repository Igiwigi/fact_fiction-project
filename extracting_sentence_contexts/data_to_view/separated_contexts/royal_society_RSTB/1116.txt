We now pass to the experiments made in similar preparations on one posterior
column only. Influence of Section of one Posterior Column.â€”Our experiments upon this point
were made on two animals, but in each case with a strength of stimulus which was not
minimal, since, although in one animal the absolute intensity of the exciting currents was
that generally used for minimal stimulation (500), yet the preparation was in a hyper-
excitable state owing apparently to the lumbar section having hit the entrance of a
posterior root. That the preparation (Cat 375) was hyperexcitable at the moment
when the intervening section was to be made, is shown by the fact that with this
weak intensity of stimulus the excitation of the lateral columns gave deflections of
166 and 285, and that of the posteriors of 168 and 202. We endeavoured to lower
the excitability by more profound etherisation, but the results evidently belong to that
class which have been considered as evoked by maximal stimuli. The true effect of
minimal excitation was not, therefore, observed.
