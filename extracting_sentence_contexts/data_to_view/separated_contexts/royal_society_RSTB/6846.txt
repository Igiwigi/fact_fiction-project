The dorsal pair of tracheal branches (figures 7, 9, 12 and 13, Â¢r.) of the rostrum has
already been adequately mentioned in describing the course of the frontal ganglion con-
nectives. In addition, however, a second pair of tracheae lies with the ventral nerve to the
mouth-parts in the median space between the supporting apodemes of the rostral tendons
(figure 8G, H, I). Both these pairs of tracheae give off numerous branches, some of
which, on account of their size and the fact that they continue parallel with their parent
trunk, suggest when seen only in transverse section that more than two pairs of tracheae
pass down the rostrum. The tracheae, not only of the rostrum but of the body generally,
are characterized by the possession of fine hair-like processes projecting from the taenidia
into the lumen (see Wigglesworth 1939, p. 182). The dorsal and ventral tracheae of the rostrum are figured by Murray & Tiegs (1935,
text-fig. 10).
