In the first place in regard to the question, which arises in all experiments
where a quantity of water is heated by an electric current conveyed in a wire, of the
excess temperature of the wire over the water, it may be said that in the present
method the measurement of the electrical energy is completely independent of any
value to be assumed for the resistance of the heating-wire, and not only that, but
owing to the steady temperature conditions inside the apparatus, no uncertainty of a
change in resistance in the wire with a change in temperature is introduced. When
the temperature inside the calorimeter has arrived at a steady state, only such
energy is used in warming the water as is supplied to the calorimeter by the electric-
heating current. The fact that the results were completely independent of the
resistance of the heating-wire was shown by using heat-wires of very difterent
resistances. In regard to the insulation of the platinum heating-wire and of polarization and
similar effects, it was considered that these played no part in the results. The
resistance of the water column through which the heating-wire passed was
enormously high and equal to a column of water 50 centims.
