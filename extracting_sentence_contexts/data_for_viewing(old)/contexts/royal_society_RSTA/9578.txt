and no lines have been observed near the position of the negative term (25,350 or
about \ 3940) given bym=1. An associated F series, by analogy, would be expected
to have its limits near 110,830 (= 85,480+25,350), but there is no evidence of the
existence of such a series.

The absence of a negative term in the observed D doublets of Mg suggests, as an
alternative view, that the associated F series may be derived from the first line
actually observed, namely 42798. In tliat case LorEensrr’s formula would give for
the limit of the F series: 84,893°0—35,728'7 = 49,164°3, and the Hicks formula
85,479°8—35,728°7 = 49,751°1.

These figures at once suggest the limit 49,778 of the “4481” series; and the
available data for the Wide doublets are, in fact, consistent with the assumption that
the agreement is exact. It would seem then that the “4481” series may be a
Fundamental series deriving its limits from the first positive line of the D series of
Wide doublets. In that case the D line \ 2798 would be expected to have a
satellite with the same separation as the lines of the “4481” series, namely,
dn = 0°99. A special search for the satellite has been made in the photographs of
the are im vacuo taken in the fourth order of the grating, but it has not been
directly observed. Indirect evidence of its possible existence, however, is afforded by
careful measurements of the intervals of the Wide pairs. The new wave-lengths are
given on the International Scale in Table VI. It will be seen that while the pairs
of the P and § series are in close agreement, indicating a normal separation of 91°5,
the interval of the D pair is not less, as would usually be the case if a satellite were
present, but greater. This is confirmed by the recent measures of these lines by
