Bulk water analyses of the synthesized carbonate glasses are particularly challenging when
considering the hygroscopic nature of the KyCO3-MgCO3 starting material and the resultant
carbonate glasses. A time series investigating for water absorption of KzCO3 powder exposed.
to air showed an uptake by the pre-dried carbonate powder of 2wt% HzO after only 10 min.
Similarly, the pre-dried 55K2CO3-45MgCO; starting material mix used in our experiments
absorbed up to 0.8 w% H2O in only 15 min at atmospheric conditions. Since the carbonate powder
prior to loading into pre-experimental noble metal containers and the synthesized glasses are
both sensitive to atmospheric moisture absorption, we have taken great care to minimize this risk
