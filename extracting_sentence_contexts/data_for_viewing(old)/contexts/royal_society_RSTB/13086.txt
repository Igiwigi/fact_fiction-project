Subject Areas: more complex nonlinear networks used in previous work. The time course of
behaviour, cognition, neuroscience learning in these networks can be linked to the hierarchical structure in the train-
ing data, captured mathematically as a set of dimensions that correspond to the
branches in the hierarchy. In this context, a new item to be learned can be charac-
terized as having aspects that project onto previously known dimensions, and
others that require adding a new branch/dimension. The projection onto the
known dimensions can be learned rapidly without interleaving, but learning
the new dimension requires gradual interleaved learning. When a new item

James L. McClelland focus on the previously known items within this branch, resulting in faster inte-
gration with less interleaving overall. The discussion considers how the brain
might exploit these facts to make learning more efficient and highlights predic-
tions about what aspects of new information might be hard or easy to learn.
