ations to both the Nothosauria and Sauropterygia, which, taken with the
Br of the skeleton, seem to suggest that the systematic position of this type

by a Theriodont Plesiosaurian in skull structure, indicates a closer affinity
the Anomodontia and Sanropterygia than has been previously evident. For
zt appears to be substantially of the same type as in Rhopalodon, and may
