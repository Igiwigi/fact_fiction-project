an exceptionally wide peristome is associated with a very feeble girdle.

The chronological sequence of the types is significant. In respect of the girdle-
character, the Bathonian Gymnocidaris (with a continuous girdle) may be assumed to
have led, by degeneration, to the Corallian Hemicidaris (where continuity is very excep-
tional and incomplete), and thence to the Arbaciide with sub-parallel upright processes
whose meeting (when it occurs) is achieved by obviously secondary growth.

Material.—A fully-grown specimen, of this common species from Faringdon (EK. 55)
reveals the surprising fact that the girdle of Hyposalenia is quite continuous. The
girdle of recent members of the Saleniide is definitely discontinuous ; perhaps this is
another example of degeneracy comparable with that just indicated for the Arbaciide.
The evidence of EH. 55 has been confirmed in very many specimens of varying size, and
even in the smallest the continuity of the girdle was found to be complete.

Description.—The processes are very broad, and they lean against one another,
meeting in a long suture. The top of the arch is widened by lateral expansions of the
