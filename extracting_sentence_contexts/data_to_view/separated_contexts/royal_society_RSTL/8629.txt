Micros. Sci. 1874). The fact that the development of the © enamel-cells ” bears a direct relation to the
thickness of the enamel to be formed also lends support to the view (which on other
grounds I am strongly inclined to support) that the enamel is formed by the direct con-
version of the enamel-cells into the hard tissue. It is difficult otherwise to account for the contrast presented by the length of the
cells in the different parts of the enamel-organ ; and T may add that the aggregate
length of the cells and the enamel cap already formed in fig. 8 jus makes up the
thickness of the enamel cap upon an average completed tooth.

* The existence of terminal caps of enamel, a character upon which alone Professor Owrn has founded his
fossil genus © Ganacrodus,” is apparently by no means uncommon ; I have found them in the eel, the perch,
the newt, and the salamander; and as they are very easily lost in making sections, it is probable that they are
present upon many teeth on which their presence has not as yet been demonstrated. The positive determination of the absence of a thin layer of enamel upon the exterior of a tooth is a matter
of no little difficulty, although it might at first 8ight appear easy enough : the double contour which is due to
the thickness of the section can hardly be with certainty distinguished from a very thin structureless external
layer, though the use of the dark-ground illumination will often bring the enamel layer out distinetly, owing to
the difference in its refractive index.
