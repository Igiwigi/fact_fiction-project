1. Introduction and summary: phenomenological motivation

The standard concordance model of cosmology (also known as ACDM (cosmological-constant
(A)-cold-dark-matter paradigm)) [1] works very well in describing the large-scale structure of
the Universe, being in excellent agreement with a plethora of diverse cosmological observations,
namely Supernovae Snla, cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations
(BAO) and gravitational lensing studies [2]. The data point towards the fact that the current-
epoch energy density of the Universe consists of 4.9% baryonic matter, 26.8% dark (gravitating)
matter and 68.3% a mysterious dark energy component, dominant at late eras (corresponding
to redshifts z <1), which is held responsible for the accelerating expansion of the Universe,
in a form compatible with the addition of a positive cosmological constant A in Einstein’s
general relativity (GR) theory (de Sitter space-time).! On the other hand, several single-field
models of inflation [4] have been falsified using CMB data [2]. In this respect, the Starobinsky
model of inflation [5], which is due to nonlinear, higher-order-in-(scalar)-curvature corrections to
GR, induced by quantum (conformal, ‘trace’) anomalies in effective field theories of (massless)
matter in the early universe, seems to fit excellently the pertinent data [2], provided one fixes
the coefficient of the (anomaly induced) higher-curvature corrections. A pressing question is
how one can distinguish among the remaining models of inflation that have not been falsified
by the data so far, and whether it would ever be possible to differentiate between models
