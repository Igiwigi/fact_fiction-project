In spite of
the number of petioles examined, intruded roots were invariably absent from the very
base of the leaf, where it is attached to the stem ; nor are such roots found in any of
the stems, although the latter are literally packed among roots. Moreover, not a single
root has been observed piercing the sclerenchymatous sheath of a rachis, whether from
within or without. These facts, combined with the almost invariably longitudinal
course of the intruded roots, would seem to show fairly conclusively that the roots
made their way into the leaves from above. Such an entry they can have effected in one of the two following ways: Hither they
may have penetrated the living tissues of the leaves in their younger parts, which
being presumably devoid of sclerenchyma would offer less resistance to their entry ;
or, what seems far more probable, they entered through the decaying upper ends of
old rachis-stumps. If it is supposed that they made their way into the younger distal parts of the leaves
before the latter became elongated, there would be at least two difficulties to be ex-
plained.
