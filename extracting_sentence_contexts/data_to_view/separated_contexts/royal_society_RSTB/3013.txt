Since the corpus
luteum is the ovarian gland, “lutein” alone, and not preparations of the entire
ovary, should be employed for purposes of ovarian medication, e.g., after ovariotomy. We have already given reasons for the conclusion that this extended theory of
the meaning and function of the corpus luteum is untenable. The fact that in a
very large number of animals cestrus, and presumably, therefore, ovulation, occur
at infrequent intervals does not support it; while it has been shown in Part I. of
this paper (p. 110) that in the Bitch, at any rate, ovulation does not take place until
after external bleeding has begun. (See also p, 116, Part I.) These facts, however, are
in no way opposed to that part of FrAENKEL’s hypothesis which assigns to the corpus
luteum the function of governing fixation of the ovum, and helping to maintain its
nutrition during pregnancy. The following is an account of our own experiments on this subject :-—
