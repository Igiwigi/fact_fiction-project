and chips, relying mainly on licensing from Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL),
but it had a proud record of innovation in vacuum tubes, culminating in the
invention of the shadow-mask CRT. RCA led in the early research on TFTs
and LCDs, but the belief that flat-panel displays were against their long-term
interests led them to withdraw from the field in 1972. The other potential
industrial leader, BTL, had stayed curiously aloof from the frenzied search
for novel display technology, partly because of their increased involvement in
semiconductor lasers for communications, but also because senior figures in
their laboratory were unconvinced that new displays were required. They said

(Gordon & Anderson 1973):

Prospects for new display technologies are clouded by the fact that there exists a device, the
familiar CRT, that has long provided a versatile, elegant, functional, economical, and largely
satisfactory solution.

In circumstances where industry was unwilling to lead in long-term research
programmes, defence funding had previously filled the gap, and we have seen
that this indeed happened in the UK. In the USA, however, the Department
of Defense (DoD) was also unconvinced about flat panels. The opposition
was led, strangely, by the scientist who had contributed much to the earlier
enthusiasm at RCA for LCs, George Heilmeier. He had left RCA in 1970, and
within two years was holding a senior post in the US DoD with responsibility
for electronic device research contracts. He told the main US Displays
Conference (Heilmeier 1973):
