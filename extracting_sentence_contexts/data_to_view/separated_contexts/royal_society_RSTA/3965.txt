The behaviour at constant mean stress (dP = 0) is considered in [49]. The total volume strain response (figure 6b) indicates that the specimen tested under
undrained conditions compacted more than the drained specimen during the initial stage of
loading. It is related to the fact that the onset of inelasticity is reached at a larger value of
total shear strain and a larger effective mean stress in the undrained test (y =5.0 x 10-3 and
P! = 24.2 MPa) than in the drained one (y =3.1 x 10-9 and P’ = 17.3 MPa). In both cases, the rock
dilated by a smaller amount before failure than it compacted at the beginning of loading. The plane-strain apparatus and the elastic-plastic decomposition of principal strains (¢1, £3)
provide increments of plastic volume strain AeP and plastic shear strain AyP:

AeP = Ac? + Ac? = (Acw*S — Act) + (Acie — AcS) (4.3)

and
AyP= Ach - Ack = (Aes — Act) — (Aegt*S — Ags). (4.4)

Dilatancy factor f is calculated from equation (2.26) assuming plane-strain compression.
