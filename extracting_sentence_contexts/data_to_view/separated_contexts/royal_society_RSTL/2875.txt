already inſiſted, and the other curious vulcanic produc-
Hions of the Euganean hills, I muſt obſerve, that, from

Syulcanic hills of that chain afford no obſervation ſo in-
Aereſting to phyſical geography and the theory of ſuch
phenomena, as that before remarked of the correſpon-
Alent direction and paralleliſm of the vulcanic and other
Franches of the Veroneſe and Vicentine diſtricts. My
Sbſervations alſo, on the vulcanic branches of theſe diſ-
aricts, do not ſeem to agree with the celebrated Monſ,
*BVETTARD's principle, who ſuppoſes, that all vulcanic
Inaterials obſervable in calcareous countries are adventi-
ious; the contrary of this being indeed demonſtrated
Fy the facts I have advanced. Nor have I entered parti-

exiſts near Gambellara, in the Veroneſe territory, a few
miles from Montebello; and, according to the informa-

adjacent diſtrict of Vicenza. Doctor FESTARI, an inge--
nious phyſician of Valdagno, whoſe curioſity I have for-
tunately excited in theſe matters, lately informs me, that
he has diſcovered a ſimilar group of priſmatic columns,.
