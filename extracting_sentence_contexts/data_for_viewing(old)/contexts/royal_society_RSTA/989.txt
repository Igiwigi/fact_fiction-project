This lack of hydrological connectivity between new development areas and their boundary
conditions (surrounding catchments) has emerged as a common area of concern for the
Sponge City initiative. While the national guidelines recommend that flood modelling should
be integrated with catchment-scale flood and water resource models, support from central
government is focused on urban development, such that integration with the larger catchment
planning processes is under-represented.

While the public generally supports government investment to reduce flood impacts and risks,
the fact that 19 of the 30 pilot cities have experienced flooding since 2014 [24] is not an encouraging
signal to send to potential investors. Water-logging or flooding has occurred in 10 of the first 16
pilot sponge cities, and 9 of the 14 later pilot cities [25]. These included Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing
and the capital cities of Fuzhou, Wuhan, Jinan and Nanning. While Beijing, and many other cities,
have since revised urban drainage designs to accommodate larger return period events [26], large
flood events will continue to blight the perceived performance of the Sponge City initiative until
the percentage of associated infrastructure increases and is better integrated with larger flood
control engineering structures. In addition, expectations of green infrastructure can be better
managed through the provision of better public information.

It would be unfair to exclusively use contemporary flood events to measure the success of
the Sponge City programme. However, as the pilot studies are completed and the concepts
are extended to cover 80% of the country by 2030, flooding from upstream areas or coastal
