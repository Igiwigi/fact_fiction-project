magnitude of (wv*) at particular length scales. Such analyses do not relate directly to the wv signal,
and cannot distinguish between the negative and positive regions in the wv time series.

Nevertheless, spectral analysis provides useful information, and as an example the (pre-
multiplied) co-spectrogram of â€”u and 2, G, is presented in figure 6 for 5+ = 7000. The time (t)
signal has been converted to space using the local mean velocity (x = fU) with the corresponding
wavenumber k,, and the ordinate in the figure is presented as the wavelength (A, =2z/ky)
normalized by viscous scales. We note that the pre-multiplied or weighted co-spectrum is
independent of U. Figure 6 presents contour shades (colour) of the pre-multiplied co-spectra
magnitudes. The dark solid line, which is 4x ~ y, seems to pass roughly through the middle of
the contours.

In fact, the proportionality of the length scale with wall distance is a well-known empirical
result in wall turbulence, especially in the inertial region [3,4]. More recently, and as discussed
at the outset, the analysis that starts from the mean momentum equation of the wall-bounded
turbulent flow has placed this distance-from-the-wall scaling on a more rigorous footing (e.g.
[12-15]), and most recently for the zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer as well
[18]. As described previously, a central element of the theory is the finding of a length-scale
distribution, W(y), that allows the mean momentum equation to be written in a self-similar from.

Here W is defined as
-1/2
d@ut

and on the inertial region W ~ y.
