need be considered when arranging the details of a ship's structure.

Some interest also attaches to a comparison between the strains of the two typical
ironclads © Minotaur” and © Bellerophon,” viewed merely as types of form and distribution

of weight. In till water the bending-strain (in proportion to the products of the dis-
placements and the lengths) is about one half as seyere in the © Bellerophon' as it is in
the © Minotaur,” on a wave-crest it is less than #w0-thirds as severe, and in a wave-hollow
it is proportionately about one and one-fourth as great in the * Bellerophon* type as it
is in the © Minotaur.” Another point of contrast is found in the fact that the maximum
hogging- and sagging-strains are practically about equal in the * Bellerophon' type,
whereas in the © Minotaur' the hogging-strain is very nearly double the sagging-strain.
The longer ship must have, therefore, a very great reserye of strength against sagging if
8he is strong enough to resist hogging; and this fact prevents the material from being
80 well disposed as it might be if there were not s0 great a difference between the two
8 extremes of strain. This follows from the consideration that an iron-built ship, such as
= the © Minotaur,” is comparatively strong against sagging, because (if the longitudinal
| = strength of the keel and keelson-work is kept up, and the bottom plates are properly
= butt-strapped) there is sure to be a reserve of tensile strength in the bottom, and because
= under compressive strains the wood upper deck becomes very effective ; whereas against
E hogging the upper part of the ship is usually much weaker, both absolutely and as
s compared with the lower part. In the case of an armoured ship like the * Minotaur,”
