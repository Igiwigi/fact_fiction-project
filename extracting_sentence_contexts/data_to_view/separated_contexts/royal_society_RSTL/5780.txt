MR. HANCOCK ON THE ORGANIZATION OF THE BRACHTIOPODA. 811

these orifices open into the cavity close behind the cesophagus, and directly above a
transverse fold of the anterior wall of the body. It is not altogether unlikely that these
chambers likewise communicate with the posterior canals, but I have failed to ascertain
the fact; and Voer! also states that the two canals of the arm are cut off from the
perivisceral cavity. Above the orifices there is another delicate membranous fold or
flap, which seems capable of closing them by being pressed down against the parietal
fold, to which the occlusor mnscles are attached, acting in the manner of a valve.
