medical imaging technologies. Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography
(CT) scanners arrived into clinical use in the early 1990s, combining the molecular detection
component with an anatomical technique to provide improved datasets to clinicians and
demonstrating the potential for multimodal imaging. Many radiology/nuclear medicine
departments are now using PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the next-generation
technology; however, there is still much work to be done to use combined molecular imaging
techniques to their full potential. There are also complications as to how they fit into clinical
pathways, the consistency of data production and imaging protocols, but the potential is clear.

While the technology for combined modality scanners or the fusing of image data from
separately collected multiple image modalities has advanced, there have been more limited
advances in the multimodality imaging tools in clinical use to allow the full potential
of multimodal imaging to be reached. Their development is complicated by the fact that
optimization for a single imaging technique is not appropriate; it must be for a combination,
and the chemical standards/parameters for multimodal agents have yet to be established.

The driver behind the production of multimodal scanners and agents is to balance the
advantages and disadvantages of different imaging techniques, i.e. sensitivity of detection versus
resolution of the image. Table 1 presents many of the key molecular imaging techniques and
their properties. The key applications are in diagnosis of disease, patient stratification and the
therapy response. Mulitmodal imaging is also an excellent tool for drug development, and
radiolabelling of constructs can be used to obtain absorption, distribution, metabolism and
excretion (ADME) and pharmacokinetics (PK) characteristics of novel molecules or constructs
that are in development as therapeutics
