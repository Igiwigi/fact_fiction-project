Intriguingly, if these main-belt objects were able to maintain significant : 3
reservoirs of preserved ice until they reach such orbits, it is not inconceivable that they could then
become indistinguishable from ‘ordinary’ JFCs from the outer solar system, raising the intriguing mea)
possibility that studies to date of JFCs may have included at least a few objects that were not from :
the outer solar system at all, and instead actually hail from the main asteroid belt. a]
In the aforementioned integrations, the effects of repeated close encounters with the terrestrial DNS
planets appeared to be the major drivers of initially JFC-like particles onto main-belt-like orbits. aon
Fortunately, for researchers with hopes of using MBCs as tracers of ice in the asteroid belt, which iG
needless to say, would be greatly complicated by significant JFC contamination of the main belt, .
the JFC interlopers in these integrations were seen to stay confined to high-eccentricity, high-
inclination orbits and did not reach the low-eccentricity, low-inclination orbits occupied by many,
but not all, of the MBCs. This is consistent with previous dynamical simulations that found similar
behaviour for a number of dynamical clones of real JFCs [128]. The possibility that some apparent members of the JFC population could in fact be from the
main asteroid belt is further supported by work showing that a handful of JFCs appear to have
substantially more stable orbits than the average JFC, and that several of those objects also show
unusually low activity relative to other comets [131]. The observational studies discussed in §2a
also found several objects with high albedos and un-comet-like spectroscopic taxonomic types
(e.g. S or Q) among the ACO population, inconsistent with JFC origins and more consistent with
origins in the main asteroid belt [27,28,39,132,133].
