unity was already beginning to look at what would be
needed as a future facility at the energy frontier. At
CERN, the construction of the Large Electron Positron
Collider (LEP) had just been approved and in the USA,
the Tevatron had just begun operation with collisions of
hadrons at around 2 TeV in the centre of mass (CM). The
consensus was that the next machine needed to push into
a new energy domain to explore the region between the
LEP mass limit and 1 TeV. For this purpose, a hadron—
hadron collider with the highest possible primary beam
energy and collision rate was considered to be ideally
suited. The requirement of high primary beam energy
comes from the fact that hadrons are composite particles
and the energy is shared between the quarks and gluons.
The high collision rate is needed to search for the very
rare events that would be associated with new particles.
These two factors therefore became the main design
challenges for the new machine.
