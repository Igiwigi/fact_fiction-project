characteristic feature of the organ-current, and, apart from its obvious resemblance
to the demarcation-current observed in cardiac tissue, is strongly suggestive of the
excitatory nature of the whole phenomenon, A point of great interest in this
connection is the influence on the rate of the decline of a nerve-organ response.
The experiments which were made on this subject were not, however, satisfactory,

owing to the lack of suitable methods; they only showed that the decline was more
rapid when the organ was excited.

The facts relating to the organ-current may now be summed up as follows :â€”

The difference between the dorsal and ventral surface of the organ is very small in
the uninjured organ when examined in situ, and under these circumstances is often
of opposite sign in different animals.

When a portion of cut tissue is examined an electromotive difference is always
found to be present, and is such that the dorsal surface of the columns is positive to
the ventral.

This difference subsides at first rapidly, and then so slowly that it may be observed
one or two hours after the preparation has been made.
