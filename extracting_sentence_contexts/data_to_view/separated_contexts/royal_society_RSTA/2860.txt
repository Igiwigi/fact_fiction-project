It would seem as though some irregular or possibly regular series of waves occurred
at the boundary, changing H, rapidly by from 0°5 to 1 km., and T, by 5° C., or
occasionally even more, and I am inclined to think that there is some connection
between these disturbances and the small pressure waves of short period that are not
infrequently shown on the micro-barograph. Discussion of the Results. The tables and figures given in the preceding part of this paper are, I hope,
observational facts about which there can be no serious dispute. In addition to the
observations in Europe we have a certain amount of information from the tropical
and equatorial regions, and from America. It is certain that as the equator is
approached the value of H, rises, and that of T, falls.
