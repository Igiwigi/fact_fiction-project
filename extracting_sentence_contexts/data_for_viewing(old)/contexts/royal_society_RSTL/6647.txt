will be comparatively large near the sides of the glacier. The superficial curyes of
structure would be all straight lines parallel to the axis of the glacier,

In actual glaciers, the forms of the curves of structure on the outer 8urface would be
modified by the fact of the unequal thinning of the glacial mass in consequence of the
more rapid thawing towards its lower extremity, 80 that the existing external surface is
no longer parallel to the longitudinal lines of motion. Consequently the outer surface
would intersect the internal structural surfaces obliquely, and the superficial curyes of
structure would be changed from straight parallel lines to yery elongated loops, but
would neyer approximate to straight transvyerse lines, as they always do at the foot of an
ice-fall, We may also observe that there could be no longitudinal development of yeins
along the axis of the glacier, as the immediate result of differential motion. Such veins
could only exist by transmission, as will be explained in the next section, where I shall
revert to the forms of the surfaces of greatest differential motion which have been here
investigated.
