468 DR. CHARLES G. BARKLA ON POLARISED RONTGEN RADIATION. for separate investigation and will not be treated in this paper. It seemed possible
that phenomena of exactly the same nature take place in gases, for the fact of
ionization implies the emission of negative corpuscles or electrons such as proceed
from metals, and, as has been shown, the non-deviable radiation from gases does
differ to a small extent from the primary radiation producing it. It had to be proved
that the difference in the behaviour of gases and heavy solids is not one of degree
merely. As explained by Professor J. J. THomson (‘Conduction of Electricity through
Gases,’ p. 268), on the hypothesis that Réntgen rays consist of a succession of electro-
magnetic pulses in the ether, each ion in the medium has its motion accelerated by
the intense electric fields in these pulses, and, consequently, is the origin of a
secondary pulse, the intensity of electric foree in which is given by the expression
es where ¢ is the charge on the ion, f its acceleration, 7 the distance from the
point considered in the pulse to the origin of the pulse, and @ the angle which the
line joining the point to the origin of the pulse makes with the direction of accelera-
tion of the ion.
