The tissues of the organ
have quite disappeared, and in their place is a space occupied on each side by the two
masses of fat body, which were shown in the last figure, and which are now enclosed by
the pericardial membrane. The space marked ext. sp., shows that the overlapping
part of the dorsal scale is almost past. It is, in fact, the remnant of the space that in
the posterior sections divided the overlapping portion of the dorsal scale from the rest

of the body. In fig. 7 the main part of the segment is reached and the organ is no longer present. The fat bodies are within the pericardium and the blood corpuscles are passing from
them to the ostium of the heart round which they are clustered so as to hide it.
