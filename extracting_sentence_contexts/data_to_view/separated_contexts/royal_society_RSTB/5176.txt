The regular sequence of beds, ‘both Cretaceous and Tertiary, especially
well seen at Atanikerdluk, includes records of successive floras which flourished for a
comparatively long period on the Arctic portion of a North Atlantic continent. It is difficult accurately to correlate the Cretaceous members of this series with the

scattered records in other regions, and I am convinced that until more facts are available
we cannot overcome the difficulty. My view is that the Greenland Cretaceous flora
represents more fully than the floras of other countries the early stages in the transitional
period from an older Jurassic-Wealden vegetation to the type of flora which continued
into the Tertiary period, and still persists in regions remote from its original home. A
comparison of late Cretaceous floras and those of Tertiary age with recent floras reveals
differences which can be expressed mainly in terms of geographical distribution :
climatic changes and other factors have played an important part, but geological history
demonstrates not only the recurrent appearance of new families and genera, with the
development of herbaceous plants in the wake of deciduous Angiosperms ; it reveals
also wanderings from one hemisphere to another, and the persistence in warmer regions
of forms which I regard as the direct descendants of Cretaceous species.
