from the mean temperature of 1843 at Bombay. A difference of
level of 1823 feet therefore gave a difference of less than one degree of temperature. The comparison of the temperatures of the three stations of Mahabuleshwur, Mer-
cara in Coorg, and Uttray Mullay in Travancore, all at the height of 4500 feet above
the sea-level, and differing little in longitude, but several degrees in latitude, affords
some interesting facts. The latitude of Uttray Mallay is about 8? 00' N., long.
