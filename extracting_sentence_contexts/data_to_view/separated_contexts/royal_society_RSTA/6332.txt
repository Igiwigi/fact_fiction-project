The
third group is the streamflow in the entire MDB, to capture possible inter-regional bird migration
impacts. In equation (3.5), By, F, and Fo are the lag lengths of the ADL specification, noting that
we investigated several combinations of the lag lengths in our statistical analyses. B, F, Fo
E(Bird,,t) = Bro + > yrjBird,s-; + }° or jFlowr+j +) yrjFlowot-j- (3.5)

Given the relatively small sample size and the fact that the degrees of freedom decline in the
lag lengths, we limited the combinations of the model specifications to B;, F;, Fo <2. We chose
the (set of) appropriate lag lengths using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) as selection
criterion. As the waterbird counts can be zero in some years, i.e. the wetland was dry at the
survey time, a logarithm specification for analysis in abundance trends was not applied because :
of zero observations.
