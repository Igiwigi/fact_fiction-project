impulse must then have travelled from an internal to an exter-
nal circle in an oblique direction, in the same time as in the
direction of the radius, and consequently with a greater velo-
city; against the first proposition. In the case of water, the
velocity is by no means 50 rigidly limited as in that of an
elastic medium, Yet it is not necessary to $uppose, nor is it
indeed probable, that there is absolutely not the least lateral
communication of the force of the undulation, but that, in highly
elastic mediums, this communication is almost insensible. In
the air, if a chord be perfectly insulated, s0 as to propagate
exactly s8uch vibrations as have been described, they will in
fact be much less forcible than if the chord be placed in
the neighbourhood of a sounding board, and probably in some
measure because of this lateral communication of motions of an
opposite tendency. And the different intensity of different parts
of the same circular undulation may be observed, by holding a
common tuning fork at arm's length, while sounding, and
turning it, from a plane directed to the ear, into a position per-
pendicular to that plane.

PROPOSITION 11I.

A Portion of a spherical Undulation, admitted through an Aper-
ture into a quiescent Medium, will proceed to be further propa-
