Reference has several times been made to the similarity between intumescences,
especially stem intumescences, and, though in a less degree, leaf intumescences also,

and wound-callus. These tissues may here be compared in more detail, as the
resemblances seem to be more than superficial and to point to an identity in all
essential points.

As has been said, stem intumescences, and wound-callus on stems, have the same
structure, and the experiments which have so far been made show that they urise
under the same external conditions. In fact, in many cases it is impossible to draw
any line between stem intumescences and wound-callus. Much work has been
already done on callus, which Kiser summarises in his ‘ Pflanzenanatomie, also
giving an account of his own researches on this question, and showing the importance
of damp air and of warmth.

I have repeated some of his experiments, and made some of my own, which I
propose to extend next summer with a view to comparing intumescences and callus,
both in leaves and in stems.

At present very few experiments have been made with wounded leaves. ‘Those
made by HaBerLANpDT* have been discussed above (p. 247).
