And the outer crust is uneven and irregular, and the one kind of rock gradually passes
.gnto the other. The outer porous crust consists of a matrix of translucent chalcedonic
Silica, with, at times, an admixture of quartz-sand and glauconite grains. This matrix
Ss filled with minute cylindrical or fusiform cavities which are the empty moulds of
Sponge-spicules. In the centre of these cavities there extends occasionally an elongated,
Frory slender, cylindrical siliceous rod, which is really the solidified infilling of the
<anal of the spicule. Thus, by a peculiar sequence of conditions, the spicules in this
Sortion of the rock have been first imbedded in a siliceous matrix, then their hollow
nals have been filled with silica, and finally the spicules themselves have been com-
pletely dissolved away, leaving only the casts of their outer form and their solidified
canals. In the central layer of massive chert, on the other hand, very frequently the
Zzpicules have disappeared ; but that it was equally as filled with spicules as the porons
Rerust is shown by the fact that in microscopic sections faint shadowy outlines of the
spicules can be detected, and the solidified canals are distinguishable even when other
traces of the 8picules are wanting. The silica derived from the solution of the spicules
of the outer crust appears, in part at least, to have been re-deposited in the central
layer in the form of chalcedonie chert, and the spicules of this layer have been thus
enveloped by the cherty matrix. As the refractive index of the spicules and of the
matrix is similar, the shadowy appearance of their outlines can be accounted for. In
some instances there are empty spicular cavities in the chert itself, as well as in the
- outer crust.
