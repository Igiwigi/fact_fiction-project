Taz progress of chemical science depends not only on the
acquisition of new facts, but on the accurate establishment,
and just valuation, of those we already possess: for its general
principles will otherwise be liable to frequent subversions; and
themutability of its doctrines will butillaccord withtheunvaried
order of nature. Impressed with this conviction, I have been in-
ducedtoexamine a lateattempt to withdraw from itsrank among
the elementary bodies, one of the most interesting objects of
chemistry. The inferences respecting the composition of char-
coal, deduced by Dr. AvsTin from his experiments on the
heavy inflammable air,* lead to changes s0 numerous in our
explanations of natural phenomena, that they ought not to
be admitted without the strictest scrutiny of the reasoning of
this philosopher, and an attentive repetition of the experi-
