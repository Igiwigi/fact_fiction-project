Also of interest is the observation that from the
lnox* minimum the system could easily cross back to the lix* state and subsequently deactivate
to the ground state, as was already proposed in the literature for U and T [51,54]. We note that the spin-orbit couplings in 5BU are not much stronger than in U or T, although
one might have expected this from the heavy-atom effect of the bromine atom. The relatively weak
spin-orbit couplings can be explained by the fact that neither the !noz* nor the 37* excitations
involve the bromine orbitals significantly. Owing to the properties of the spin-orbit Hamiltonian,

very large spin-orbit couplings could only be expected if the two involved states differ in one : =
orbital localized at the heavy bromine atom. For example, the coupling between the !1yoÂ¢,, : S
and Snprogy, states amounts to 860cm~ at the Franck-Condon geometry.
