How were physicists able to solve this difficult problem without actually doing
the computations in algebraic geometry? The short answer is: by placing the
enumerative problem in the right physical context. Within quantum theory it
makes perfect sense to combine all the numbers Ny into a single generating

function
F(g) => Naa’.
d

In fact, this function has a straightforward physical interpretation. It can be seen
as a probability amplitude for a string to propagate in the Calabi-Yau space
X. In quantum theory one has to operate under the fundamental principle of
summing over all possible histories with a weight given by the classical action. In
that spirit a quantum string can be thought to probe all possible rational curves
of every possible degree d at the same time, with weight q‘. The classical limit is
recovered when we send the parameter g to zero, in which case only the degree
d=0 curves contribute, i.e. the points of X.

But there was a second ingredient that helped to find the physical solution.
There exists an equivalent formulation of this physical process using a so-called
mirror Calabi~Yau manifold Y. As far as classical geometry is concerned, the
spaces X and Y are very different; they do not even have the same topology. But
