Therefore, the classical Bayes formula for conditional probabilities
is inapplicable and one can expect that, for quantum conditional probabilities which are defined
in the Hilbert space formalism, the formula (5.5) can be violated [35]. The classical LTP in our setting can be formulated as follows. We remind that the probabilities
pi(s; t),s =0,1, depend on the initial state %, i.e. in fact, we could even use the notation p;(s; t|W). Among the possible initial mental states of the pairs of players (G1, G2), the states ym,k,m =0,1,
play a very special role. Here, initially the players were completely sure in their strategies, G, with
the strategy k and G2 with the strategy m.
