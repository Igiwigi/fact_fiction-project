of an iodized plate of silyer, or a sensitive photographic paper, be protected from the
action of light, whilst the other half is exposed to a constant source of light for such a
time that no alteration, either perceptible to the eye or capable of being developed by
photographic preparations, is effected on the sensitive surface, the plate possesses the Pro-
perty, when exposed to a uniform but very slight amount of light, to blacken on the
insolated half, whilst the part not previously exposed remains unaffected. If, in the first
Short insolation, every part of the plate was not exposed to the same intensity of light,
the blackening effected by the following uniform exposure corresponds to this intensity,
80 accurately indeed, that a daguerreotype picture commenced by this slight exposure
may be developed by subsequent uniform insolation, almost as perfectly as if each
amount of light represented on the picture, and not a constant amount, had acted for the

whole time upon the plate, The explanation of this fact does not require the assump-
tion of a new class of rays, which cannot commence, but only continue, the photo-chemical

action. The phenomenon is in reality a simple consequence of the laws of photo-chemical
induction, and proves that these relations, which we have examined only in the case of
chlorine and hydrogen, occur in a slightly modified form in other photo-chemical pro-
cesses. If the chlorine and hydrogen mixture were a solid substance which could be
fixed upon paper without diminishing its sensibility to light, this paper must exhibit
exactly the same singular property which BEcQUEREL first observed with the daguerreo-
type plate, or other photo-chemically sensitive surface. In order to prove this asser-
