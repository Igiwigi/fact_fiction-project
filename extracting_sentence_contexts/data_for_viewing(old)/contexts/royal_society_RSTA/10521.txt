a § 43. Before passing to the immediate question of the sun-spot connection, I
‘Bvould call attention to the fact that the values assigned to the ranges in
ables XXXIII. and XXXIV. are without exception greater than those already
@iven in Tables XI. and XIIL, and that the differences between the two sets of
Sresults are more conspicuous in winter than in summer. This is an exceedingly good
illustration of the principle already discussed in § 21. A range in Table XXXIII. is
she arithmetic mean of 11 ranges, each based on a combination of only 5 days’
Eresults ; ; whereas in Table XI. a range is based on the combination of 55 days’ results.
Zhe range in Table XXXIII. thus exceeds that in Table XI., the excess being most
Enoticeable at those seasons of the year when the hours of occurrence of maxima and

inima are most variable, or when irregular disturbances are largest and most
QAnumerous.
