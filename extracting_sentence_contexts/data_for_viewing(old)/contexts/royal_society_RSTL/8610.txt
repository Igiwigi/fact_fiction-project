backwards, 4. e. towards the animal's tail. There are about six of them on each side,
and they are situated at tolerably regular intervals. One of these diverticula is seen
highly magnified in Plate XIII. fig. 9. A short branch is seen to enter the oviduct at
an angle. The branch is constructed in the same manner as the oviduct itself, and has
its cilia directed inwards towards the cavity of the duct. I1t ends abruptly, as far as
definite oviducal structure is concerned, but from its abrupt termination is prolonged
an interlacement of connective-tisxue fibres, forming a sort of tube or cavity. There
can be no doubt that these branches here described are the rudiments of the branched
ovary possessed by lower Planarians, such as Dendrocelum lacteum. Tn Bipalium a
single one of the branches, the most anterior or terminal one, has become enlarged
and differentiated, and has taken on the whole of the ovarian duties: the remaining
branches are present in a rudimentary condition, like the yelk-glands: in Rhynchodemus
both diverticula and yelk-gland have disappeared. Our Land-Planarians are, in fact,
in their ovary just like Polycelis cornta, O. Schmidt (Dendroccelen Strudelwiirmer,
Taf. iii. fig. 1). The position of the oviduct, as seen in transverse vertical sections,
is of great importance: it is always in close relation with the main trunk of the
primitive vascular system, lying immediately above it or just within it in Ãž. Ceres, and
slightly externally to its median vertical line. This position holds good throughout the
course of the oviduct in Bipalium, Rhynchodemus,and, singularly enough, in Dendrocelum
lacteum also (Plate XIV, fig. 7), showing how closely related are all the forms; and I
was surprised to find in Dendrocelum lacteum the oviduct s0 far histologically differ-
