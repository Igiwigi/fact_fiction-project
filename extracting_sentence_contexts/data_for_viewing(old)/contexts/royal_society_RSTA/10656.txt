For ‘calcium chloride a similar calculation gives the relation ¢

Such a large difference in the influence of concentration change on the actual velocities
of the two ions seems hardly to be expected.

It is also difficult to explain by any change in u and v the fact that if we consider
solutions up to 0°1 N of potassium nitrate and chloride and barium nitrate and
chloride, in the case of the three former no change in p occurs; whilst for the latter

* The conclusions of JAHN (‘ Zeitschrift fiir Phys. Chem.,’ 33, 545, 1900; 35, 1, 1900) point to the

fact that with increasing concentration, up to 55 the velocity of the ions increases in solutions of potassium,

sodium, and hydrogen chloride, the ratio of the velocities, however, remaining constant. (See also
