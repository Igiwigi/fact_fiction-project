class of house. This, however, is not so according to the Table, for the death-rate
from phthisis is much the highest in 3-roomed houses, and then diminishes to
1-roomed houses, in which it becomes almost as low as in better-class houses. When
the deaths from phthisis in the Poor-houses and Infirmary are set down against those
living in 1- and 2-roomed houses, this class has still a lower death-rate from phthisis
than those living in 3-roomed houses. On consideration, the explanation of this
appears to be quite simple. Deaths from phthisis do not usually occur much under
20 years of age, tubercular disease under that age usually taking other forms. Now
those living in 1-roomed houses, and who would be most liable to be attacked by
phthisis, have been already killed off at a much earlier age by diarrhea, acute bron-
chitis, broncho-pneumonia, tubercular meningitis, ete. ; hence the smaller death-rate
from phthisis in 1- and 2-roomed houses. In fact, the diseases just mentioned may be
almost considered as the complement of phthisis, so that as the one increases the total
of the others diminishes, but less rapidly : their sum, therefore, still shows a marked
increase from 4- to 1-roomed houses.
