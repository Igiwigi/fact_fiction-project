which is replaced by a triangular sheet of fibrous tissue attached to the edge of the
arytenoid and to the pad of fibro-cartilage which, laterally, lies between it and the
cricoid.

The cardiac pulvinar vocale of each side is continuous with the arytenoid. It extends
along the edge of the notch of the cricoid, and although the transition between pulvinar
and cricoid is rather abrupt, they do not appear to be separated by perichondrium.

Near the end of the notch of the cricoid a rod of cartilage, of the same type as that
composing the pulvinar, runs into the vocal chord. It is continuous with the cricoid
and also, for a short distance, with the pulvinar. It appears to correspond to the
“‘ processus vocalis des pars cricoidea ’’ described by BLume (1930) in the genus Bufo,
and the fact of its union with the pulvinar vocale is a step towards the fulfilment of
his prediction that an Anuran would yet be found in which the lip of the vocal chord
