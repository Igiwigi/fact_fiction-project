But they do not possess the quite correct radius called for by the
curve, Converting the range in mica into corresponding ranges in air the first ring is
found to be placed in the position shown above the curve. The darkened area
(marked 1) is a section of the ring halo. A discussion of this point cannot be entered on till further facts are considered. When the darkening within the first ring is yet only in its initial stages the outer
shell due to RaC may begin to appear. This is seen in the published photographs.*
The extreme radius of the outer ring at this stage is very little less than it finally
becomes.
