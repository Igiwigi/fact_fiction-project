current was observed on 134 days, from the 27th of April to the 11th of September ;
of which on 24 days it ran from the north, on 86 days from the south, and on 24 days
there was no surface-current at all. The quantity of chlorine was determined for every
sample by titration, and from that the quantity of salt deduced by multiplication with
the determined coefficient 1:812. The mean quantity of salt for the current from the
North was 15:994 per 1000; that for the current from the South 11:801 ; that for the
period when there was no current at all was 13342. Once a week a sample was taken
from the bottom, by sending a reversed bottle down to the bottom, turning it there,
and after having allowed it to stand some time, taking it slowly up. The mean of
nineteen observations was 19-002 per 1000 salt, which, according to the manner in which
the samples were taken, is rather under than above the real mean, and proves clearly
that it is water from the Kattegat which runs at the bottom of the Sound. But we
have also direct obseryations of the same fact. Some years ago a steamer was, close to
Elsinore, struck by another steamer, and sunk a very short time after the. collision.

When aftery ards, in quiet sea, without current, a diver went down to save the passen-
gers' goods, he found a violent current from the North. 'To the same class of pheno-
mena belongs also the observation that large deep-going vessels not unfrequently go on
in the Sound against surface-current, where smaller vessels do not succeed.

This under-current of Elsinore reaches often, and perhaps always, the harbour of
Copenhagen, which I ascertained by a series of observations for which the laying of
