The china-clay works lie on the 750 ft. contour, so
that this flat appears to be part of the 750 ft. platform mentioned above. A typical moor-
land marsh lies in this hollow, dominated throughout by Molinia caerulea save in the central
stream complex. This kaolin pit was first visited in the autumn of 1935, and immediately attracted notice
from the fact that the excavations had exposed a very long face of deep peat above the
kaolinized granite. In places the peat was as much as 10 ft. (3-05 m.) thick, and then
exhibited the stratigraphy shown in the field-notes reproduced below. North face of kaolin pit, Hawks Tor, Bodmin Moor, 1935
