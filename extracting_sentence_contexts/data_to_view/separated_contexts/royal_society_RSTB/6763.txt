What is the
physical basis of chromosome movement, which must certainly take place before even
molecular forces of the type visualized could possibly affect behaviour? The only
reply to all this is to confess how little we really know about the physics of the cell. It is therefore to the facts in this paper rather than to the conclusions that attention
should be directed. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I am glad of this opportunity to express my appreciation of the immense debt
which I, in common with every other worker in the Barker Cryptogamic Laboratory,
owe to the personality of Professor Lang. On this occasion I am also indebted to
Professor Hartree, F.R.S., and Mr Dearden, M.Sc., for advice and help with the
calculations, to Dr Astbury and the Oxford Press for permission to reproduce text-fig. 1,
and to Dr Astbury personally for information and advice.
