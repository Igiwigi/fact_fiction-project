These two normal curves were now drawn by aid of the Table II., which was
calculated afresh for this purpose from the exponential.* | These curves sae lotted out
in fig. 1, and their ordinates added together give the resultant curve. It will te seen that
this curve is in remarkably close agreement with the original asymmetrical frequency-
curve, an agreement quite as close as we could reasonably expect from the com-

parative smallness of the number of individuals dealt with, and the resulting fact
that the observation-curve can at best only be an approximation to the true
resultant.

2nd Solution—Precisely similar calculations were undertaken for the value
py = — 6'724, and it will, accordingly, be sufficient to cite the final conclusions
here.

Quadratic for y: y* — 3412y — 6°724 = 0.
