The distributions of these quantifiers in the network, or the relations between them, often
provide a tangible and understandable, albeit limited, description of even very large systems. In
this paper, we will also consider the community structure—a so-called mesoscopic property—of
the entanglement networks. This refers to a property commonly observed in complex networks,
namely, the fact that nodes can be grouped into communities such that the density of links among
the members of each community is considerably higher than the overall density in the network.

3. The XX model

In the literature of quantum spin Hamiltonians, and generally when studying quantum phase
transitions, one often works in the thermodynamic limit or considers closed boundary conditions
wherein translational invariance is generally guaranteed. This implies that most two-spin
correlation functions, including concurrence, which is built upon them, depend only on the
distance between the spins [36,50,51].
