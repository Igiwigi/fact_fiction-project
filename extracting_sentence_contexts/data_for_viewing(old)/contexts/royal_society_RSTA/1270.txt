nonlinearity has derivative term cu’ with c small. Since it is not true that f(t, u, p) => 0 their example
also requires modification.

We now give three (families of) examples with power type functions.

Example 7.2. Consider the family of problems with three parameters k, cy, c3:
u(t) + cyu*(t) + c3u’2(t) =0, te (0,1), u’(0) =0, u(1) = By [ul], (7.1)

with k>1, c;>0 and p;[u] =f u(t)dBy(t) satisfying 6)[1] <1 (this is the hypothesis £1[y1] <1
here).

This is a simple example of case (II). Here F(u,p) = cru + c3p?. For r>0 we have, from
proposition 4.3, Q(r) =cyr* exp(c3r). We will show that (S;) of theorem 7.1 holds. In fact, it is
clear that f(u,p) < cir® + 63(cyr* exp(c3r))? <mr for 0<u<r and |p| < Q(r) for r>0 sufficiently
small whatever the value of m. Also, it is clear that f(u,p) > c1 uk> cy RK > MR for R<u<R/y
and |p| < Q(R/y) for R sufficiently large whatever [a, b] is used and whatever the value of M. This
shows that there exists at least one positive solution. Of course 0 is also a solution of this problem.

We can allow some t dependence, for example we can have cj(t),c3(t) where ci,c3 are
continuous and c;(t) < c; on [0,1] and c;(t) is strictly positive on [a,b].


Example 7.3. Consider the three-point BVP

u(t) + ul/2(t) + cgu’2(t) =0, t€ (0,1), u/(0) =0, u(1) = Bu (5) , (7.2)
