We proceed in this manner because we desire the development of the generating
symmetric function

there being a denominator factor for every a, 8, y, ... product in which no letter is
repeated. The expansion of this fraction involves the whole of the homogeneous
product-sums of such a, f, y,... products; and we form these product-sums through
the medium of the sums of the powers of the products which are, in fact,
