increases (given richness and abundance) as some species
get progressively rarer. A more pragmatic argument comes
from Chao et al. [6], who noted that estimating the relative
abundance of rare species is an increasing problem for diver-
sity measures as @ increases; they therefore suggest using
only more estimable Hill diversities with ¢ <1. However,
theoretical work suggests that even richness (¢=1) is
poorly estimated [24,25], and by this logic should not be
used either. Finally, and most generally, diversity measures
have traditionally been considered separate from abun-
dance/density measures (but see [78,79]), whereas with
increasing ¢ values, observed diversity and observed abun-
dance tend to be more strongly correlated (and in fact
approach a correlation of one in our datasets). Despite these
arguments, our results show that Hill diversities with 7>1
are meaningful ecological diversity measures, at least in the
sense that they convey more information about function
than do more widely used Hill numbers. Choosing to exclude
these Hill diversities might be desirable for some conceptual-
izations of diversity, but we are opening the narrower
question of which Hill diversities—with their variable
emphasis on richness, abundance, evenness and domi-
nance—best explain ecosystem function. In this pursuit,
allowing diversity metrics to highlight absolute abundance
is valuable.
