W urxzver any difference of opinion exists on philosophical
subjects depending on experiment or observation, it is much
more useful simply to state facts, than to reason on them

own, and by which each may be compared with the annual
variations determined by very distant observations, according
to the more usual method. Of sixteen stars south of the
zenith, observed at Dublin, it will be seen, by the table, that
thirteen of them either indicate, or at least are not incon-
sistent with that irregularity which I have noticed under the
name of southern deviation ; of these thirteen, about half
