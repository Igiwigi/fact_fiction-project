It was evident from these experiments that the results obtained with carbonic oxide
and electrolytic gas were affected by the presence of the aqueous vapour. Since at the
temperature reached in the explosion the excess of carbonic oxide reacts with the
steam, forming carbonic acid and liberating hydrogen, the: presence of aqueous vapour
appears to increase the affinity of carbonic oxide for oxygen and diminish that of
hydrogen. Such an effect is exactly the opposite of that produced by adding carbonic
acid to the mixture before explosion. BuNsES showed in his first paper that when an
excess of hydrogen is exploded with oxygen in presence of some carbonic acid, ome of
the latter is reduced by the excess of heated hydrogen to carbonic oxide. Thus the
previous addition of aqueous vapour, one of the products of the reaction, alters the
apparent division of the oxygen, just as the previous addition of carbonie acid, the other
product of the reaction, alters it in an opposite direction. This fact accounts in par
for the discrepancies observed in comparing my experiments with Buxssx's, for while
my explosions were made at an initial temperature varying between 15* C. and 17* C.,
BuxsEN made one set, of explosions between 22* C. and 23? C., and the other eb between
2* C. and 5* C., 80 that very different quantities of aqueous vapour were present in the
different experiments. In order, therefore, to make the experiments a real test of the
law of mass, it was necessary to perform the explosions with dry gases in a dry
eudiometer,

Before proceeding to repeat the experiments with dry carbonic oxide and electro-
lytic gas, another attempt was made to determine whether, in a dry eudiometer,
oxygen is completely burnt when exploded with a large excess of carbonie oxide.
This experiment led to the important discovery that dry carbonic oxide and oxygen do
