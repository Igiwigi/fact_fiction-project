instead of which, the regenerated stone contains thin laminz of
crystals, which are probably augites.

I cannot leave this subject without noticing some particulars,


on Basalt, &c. 395

in which the process of arrangement described in the early part
of this Letter, appears to yield a probable explanation of some
of the peculiarities of basalt. The general disposition of basalt
to divide into globular masses, in decomposing, is too remarkable
a fact to have escaped the attention of naturalists ; though, as
far as I am informed, no satisfactory explication of it has been

A given. The common effects of decomposition are obviously ina-
8 dequate; for it is common to see a large block of amorphous
E basalt separate into numerous balls, after a few months or years
= exposure to the weather; and, rapid as the process of decom-
5 position has been in the intervening portions, these balls resist
[= its farther progress with uncommon obstinacy. May not this
= be attributed to the formation of the radiated spheroids, whose
Z occurrence in my experiment I have already mentioned ? and
= may not their greater resistance of weather simply arise from
S their aggregation being more perfect than that of the incoherent
