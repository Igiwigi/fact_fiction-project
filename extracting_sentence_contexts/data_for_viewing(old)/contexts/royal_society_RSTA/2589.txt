immediately aware of how much the culture and mentality (background, value system, basic
criteria of truth, procedures, objectives,. ..) of mathematicians differs from those of physicists—
which, in turn, are very different from those of other scientists, let alone engineers. Looking closer,
you discover drastic dissimilarities between the cultures of pure mathematicians and applied
mathematicians, then between cultures of mathematicians in different areas, then between
cultures in different subfields of the same mathematical discipline, etc.

Browsing mathematical journals for a couple of days, one can easily spot that there is no
obvious common standard of proofs for different subjects. Out of curiosity, I’ve tried to read
some of the key papers in Algebraic Topology. Typically, such a paper has 30-50 pages and
runs as follows. After an introduction, the statement of results, and some general remarks, four
or five cases are analysed in some detail. After that, the proof is concluded by an observation
that the analysis of the remaining 437 cases—or was it in fact 653?—is similar, but easier. What
struck me most, though, was that, even for the few cases that were considered, their analysis
referred to pictures in a highly non-trivial way. It is not that I, as someone coming from a different
background, do not understand these proofs. What I do not understand is how these texts are
published in top journals and are considered as valid proofs by the community. I do not expect
this type of argument to be formalized effortlessly. To conform with the standards common in,
say, Finite Group Theory, these texts would have to be made a dozen times longer, sometimes a
hundred times longer. Who would write such texts, who would publish them and who would
read them?


On the other hand, who am I to question the wisdom of my Topology colleagues? I do not
have any doubts whatsoever that they should know what they are doing, since otherwise they
