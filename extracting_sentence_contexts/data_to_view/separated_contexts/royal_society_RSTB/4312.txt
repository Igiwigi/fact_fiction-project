The spheno-maxillary angle also cannot be accurately measured, since the basion

is not available, but it is certain that it lay somewhere between 90° and 100°,
probably between 92° and 96° (the average of Australians, measured by DuckwortH,
is 92°, European 75°), The most certain method applicable here -is the one
suggested by Knaanson, following Frareont, namely, by measuring the distance
from the glabella on the prolongation of the glabella-lambda line of the foot-point of
a perpendicular drawn from the prosthion. The distance in this skull is 22 mm., the
range in Australians being from 5 to 25. From these facts, the conclusions may be
drawn that the prognathism of the Talgai face is of a very marked but not extra-
ordinary degree. The forehead, sloping in character, with poor supra-orbital development, pe no
significant increase in the size of the lateral angular processes of the frontal, has been
already described. In the facial aspect, these characters are combined with a
depressed nasion and wide inter-orbital distance, which are very materially responsible
for the characteristic “ facies” of the skull.
