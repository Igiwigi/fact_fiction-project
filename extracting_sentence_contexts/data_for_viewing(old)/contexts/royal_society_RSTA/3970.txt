a pre-eminent challenge to understand their role in the present, past and future ocean.
There are multiple processes that drive the uptake and release of TEIs, and properties that
determine their rates are unevenly distributed (e.g. sediment composition, redox conditions
and (bio)physical dynamics). These factors complicate our efforts to find, measure and
extrapolate TEI fluxes across ocean basins. GEOTRACES observations are unveiling the
oceanic distributions of many TEIs for the first time. These data evidence the influence of the
sedimentâ€”water boundary on many TEI cycles, and underline the fact that our knowledge
of the source-sink fluxes that sustain oceanic distributions is largely missing. Present flux
measurements provide low spatial coverage and only part of the empirical basis needed
to predict TEI flux variations. Many of the advances and present challenges facing TEI
flux measurements are linked to process studies that collect sediment cores, pore waters,

sinking material or seawater in close contact with sediments. However, such sampling has not [3
routinely been viable on GEOTRACES expeditions. In this article, we recommend approaches =
to address these issues: firstly, with an interrogation of emergent data using isotopic mass- is
balance and inverse modelling techniques; and secondly, by innovating pursuits of direct D3
TEI flux measurements. We exemplify the value of GEOTRACES data with a new inverse 1S
model estimate of benthic Al flux in the North Atlantic Ocean. Furthermore, we review viable : >
flux measurement techniques tailored to the sediment-water boundary. We propose that such :
