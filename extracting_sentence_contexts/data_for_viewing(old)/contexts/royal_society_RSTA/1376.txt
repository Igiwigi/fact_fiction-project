paper attempts to summarize the nature of changes
occurring and the impact they are having on the
design flood magnitude, with a focus on the urban
catchments that we will increasingly reside in as time
climate change, antecedent conditions goes on. Two lines of reasoning are used to assess and
model changes in design hydrology. The first of these
involves using observed storms and soil moisture
conditions and projecting how these may change into
the future. The second involves using climate model
simulations of the future and using them as inputs
into hydrologic models to assess the changed design
estimates. We discuss here the limitations in both and
suggest that the two are, in fact, linked, as climate
model projections for the future are needed in the
first approach to form meaningful projections for the
future. Based on the author’s experience with both
lines of reasoning, this invited commentary presents a
theoretical narrative linking these two and identifying
factors and assumptions that need to be validated
before implementation in practice.
