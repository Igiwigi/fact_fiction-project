the end. At the same time, the notches already referred to give rise to similar rays,
which also divide (fig. 12, c). These branches soon meet and, in course of time, a disc
similar to that shown in fig. 12, e, results.

6. The Dise of an Ordinary Tube-foot.—Mention has already been made of the fact that
a pair of tube-feet is present in each ambulacral area in the imago of 2. miliaris. In
the terminal portion of each tube-foot three separate rudiments are laid down. The
two “ lateral” rays in each triradiate develop more rapidly than the “ median ’’ one,
giving off branches which elaborate until, in the late pluteus, the condition shown in
fig. 13, e, is reached. Meanwhile a number of calcareous granules appear at a some-
what lower level than, and alternating with, the original three triradiates (fig. 13, b).
Six additional elements, in all, are present, but, in some cases, all six are formed almost
simultaneously, in others only three or four appear at first, and, when these have developed
into small triradiate spicules, the remaining three or two are laid down (fig. 13, c). Each
of these rudiments develops into a slender triradiate spicule (fig. 13,d), the two “lateral”
arms of which grow tapidly, sending off branches at intervals on the outer edge only.
Each branch soon divides again and, in course of time, the structure shown in fig. 13, f,
