capacity. More recently even the connections from the baseband unit at the base of the cellular
towers to the antennas at the top of the tower have migrated to optical links [8,9]. The fifth
generation wireless systems are expected to support much higher access rates, reaching gigabits
per second per user. Mobile networks are also constrained by spectral efficiency and must support
parallelism for future growth. This means a larger number of small cells with high backhaul
capacity requirements and therefore a larger burden on the optical networks [9].

The increase of metro-only traffic also indicates a shift in traffic patterns from aggregating
and pulling traffic deep into the network, for example to a distant data centre, to moving data
locally within the metro network. These are very different networking scenarios often referred
to as north-south (aggregation to core) versus east-west (metro-only) traffic flows. The metro
environment is much more cost and energy sensitive and the metro market is driven more by
large numbers rather than high performance. In fact, the traffic composition in a metro network
is very similar to a data-centre network, where the majority of traffic comprises east-west flows
[7]; however, the metro area is clearly more distributed and the network nodes or end users are
much more heterogeneous. Applications within a metro environment range from radio access,



sensor networks and consumer communications to storage area networks (e.g. for the finance
and entertainment industries), scientific computing and large campus networks.

To deal with energy concerns in future optical networks, photonic integration has emerged
as an important technology. In a photonic integrated circuit, optical system components are
fabricated at the chip scale similar to electronic integrated chips. This technology constitutes
