Insects, apparently of the same species, were seen on the cones and also
around the female inflorescences. Attempts to capture specimens were unsuccessful. These facts favour the view that Welwitschia is partially, if not entirely, insect-
pollinated. In further support of this opinion may be adduced (1) the narrow
entrance to the micropyle of the female flower, which is ill-adapted to catch wind-
blown pollen ; and (2) the large number of pollen-grains, which reach the top of the
nucellust (fig. 17). Hooxert found it “reasonable to suppose that impregnation
is effected by insect-agency,” though this conclusion was no doubt based upon a
misapprehension as to the condition of the ovule when pollination normally occurs.
