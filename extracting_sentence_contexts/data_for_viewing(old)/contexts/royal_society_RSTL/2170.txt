160 Mr. Fatapay on the mutual action of sulphuric acid

takes place, the results above, minus the baryta, will repre-
sent its composition : from which it would appear, that one
proportional of the acid consists of two proportionals of 8ul-
phuric acid, twenty of carbon, and eight of hydrogen ; these
constituents forming an acid equivalent in saturating power
to one proportional of other acids. Hence it would seem,
that half the sulphuric acid present, at least when in combi-
nation, is neutralized by the hydro-carbon ; or, to speak in
more general terms, that the hydro-carbon has diminished
the saturating power of the sulphuric acid to one half. This
very curious and interesting fact in chemical affinity was
however made known to me by Mr. HENNELL of Apothecaries'
Hall, as occurring in some other compounds of sulphuric
acid and hydro-carbon, before I had completed the analysis
of the present acid and salts ; and a similar circumstance is
known with regard to muriatic acid, in the curious com-
pound discovered by M. Kind, which it forms with oil of
turpentine. Mr. HENNELL is I believe on the point of offering
an account of his experiments to the Royal Society, and as
regards date they precede mine.

It may be observed, that the existence of sulphuric acid in
the new compounds, is assumed, rather than proved; and
