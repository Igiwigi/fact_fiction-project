his rule, that: “ Of two muscles, or of two parts of a muscle, that nearer the head
end of the body tends to be supplied by the higher, that nearer the tail end by the
lower nerve.” This is so: almost as a matter of course, if the limb, as the theory
asserts, is built up of lateral extensions of the segmental series of the body. And
if, as I urge, the members of this segmental series, when taken from before
backward, jut further and further from the median plane of the trunk, there follows
as a corollary from the first rule that second rule whi

ch HerrincuaM lays down,
namely, that.the muscul

ature of the apex of the limb belongs to segments posterior
to some of those in the attached base of the limb. Here it is that the curious fact

comes in—that the most posterior segment which contributes to the limb musculature
contributes in each limb to the extreme apex and to the extreme base, but not to
the upper arm (or thigh), so that the hindermost muscular ray is one with a break in
its middle portion.
Herrincuam’s third rule runs: ‘“ Of two muscles, that which is nearer the surface
tends to be supplied by the higher, that which is further from it by the lower nerve.”
