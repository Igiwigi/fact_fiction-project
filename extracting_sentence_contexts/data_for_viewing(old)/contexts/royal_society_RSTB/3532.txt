OBSERVATIONS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ORNITHORHYNCHUS. 77

(e) The Archenteron and its Walls in the Postgastrular Stage.—We have already
shown in this and in our earlier communication (03) that in the preceding
“gastrular” stage the archenteric cavity is not a tubular canal, but is relatively
wide and dorso-ventrally flattened. In these respects it agrees with the corre-
sponding stage of the reptilian archenteron as represented in the descriptions and
figures of various authozs, e.g., MeHnert, WiLL, Mirsukurt, etc.

But even in the “ postgastrular” stage now under consideration it is easy
to obtain the clearest evidence of the fact that the typical and original form of
the archenteric canal is that of a transversely elongated and dorso-ventrally
compressed cavity. It is true that it no longer possesses this character throughout.
We have just seen that the blastoporic aperture bears traces of its primitive widely
extended form. In front of this, however, we have seen that the canal undergoes
interruption, amounting in some places to complete suppression and obliteration.
This is most marked in the slightly older Specimen E, as illustrated in figs. 41-43.
But even in Specimen P the partial obliteration of the canal is illustrated in the
series of figs. 36-39 (cf. also text-figs. 10 and 11). We are inclined to attribute
this more or less complete obliteration to the occurrence of a somewhat energetic
cell-proliferation in the parietes of the canal. In any case, this obliterative
phase is not necessarily a permanent one, for at a still later stage (cf text-
fig. 12, from Specimen H) we find that a very distinct canal reappears in the
