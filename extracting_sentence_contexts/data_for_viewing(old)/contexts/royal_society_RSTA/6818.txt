Parr II. Experiment

The first object was to operate a galvanometer reliably so that over a long time interval
(e.g. 30min.) all other disturbances were small compared with thermal fluctuations. To
achieve the required sensitivity, the deflexions of the primary galvanometer were amplified
by introducing a split photocell system in the reflected primary beam, and measuring the
current from this system by a secondary galvanometer.

Tron-selenium photocells were used without electronic amplification since this arrangement
gave the best stability, but it necessitated using a sensitive secondary galvanometer whose

period was comparable with that of the primary. This fact entailed the development of
equation (76).

It was possible to test the detailed theory by varying such factors as the degrees of damping
of primary and secondary galvanometers, and to confirm that Ising’s, and not Astbury’s,
limit is the correct one.
