The Production of Kojic Acid from Different Sources of Carbon. The mode of formation of kojic acid from carbohydrates by fungi is of considerable
biochemical interest because of the fact that the y-pyrone nucleus is a common con-
stituent of so many groups of naturally occurring chemical compounds. With a view
to obtaining some information on this point, a series of tests, detailed below, was
carried out on the production of kojic acid from different sources of carbon. A CzapeKx-Dox medium (Medium A) was made up of the same salt composition as
that described on p. 7.
