Read November 26, 1812. Amoxe the known forms of crystallized bodies, there is no
one common to a greater number of substances than the
regular octohedron, and no one in which a corresponding
difficulty has occurred with regard to determining which mo-
dification of its form is to be/considered as primitive; since in
all these- substances the tetrahedron appears to. have equal
claim to be received as the original from which all their other
modifications are to be derived. The relations of these solids to each other is most distinctly
exhibited to those who are not much conversant with crystal-
lography, by assuming the tetrahedron as primitive, for this
may immediately be converted 'into an octohedron by the
removal of four smaller tetrahedrons from its solid angles.
(Fig. 1.)

The substance which most readily admits of division by
fracture into these forms is fluor spar ; and there is no dif-
culty in obtaining a sufficient quantity for such experiments,
But it is not, in fact, either the tetrahedron or the octohedron,
which first presents itself as the apparent primitive form ob-
tained by fracture. Â»

If we form a plate of uniform thickness by two successive
divisions of the 8par, parallel to each other, we shall find the

plate divisible into prismatic rods, the section of which is a
rhomb of 70*g2/ and 109* 28' nearly; and if we again split these
rods transversely, we shall obtain a number of regular acute
rhomboids, all similar to each other, having their superficial
angles 60* and 120), and presenting an appearance of primi-
tive molecule, from which all the other modifications of such
crystals might very simply be derived. And we find, more-
over, that the whole mass of fluor might be divided into, and
conceived 'to consist of, these acute rhomboids alone, which
may be put together sv as to fit each other without any inter-
vening vacuity.
