fertilised at all. In the most favourable experiment 12 per cent. of the ova develope
to eight days’ plutei, but in most cases only about 1 per cent. developed. As re
the hybrid larve themselves, they were found in all cases to be considerably sma! er

of the pure Strongylocentrotus larvie, and still shorter as compared with pure Echinus
