as follows:

u, = au, + Pu,, ug = bu, + al, u, =Cug o+ Bu, , &c.
it would be necessary to divide the whole investigation into
SIX cases, and to integrate six several equations of differences,

and after all, the general term of the series would not be
obtained, but merely the several general terms of six other
s8eries which, interlaced, as it were, one with the other, form
the series in question; which is in fact much the same way

numbers as consisting of several other arithmetical progres-
