ensure that young children have exposure to nature and ani-
mals, as these sorts of experiences promote children’s
understanding of biological concepts [30].

Death education should be frank and honest, but it does
not have to be head-on. Research shows that understanding life
and understanding death are intertwined; so providing chil-
dren with biological information about the life cycle and
how the body works may have a positive influence on their
understanding of death [12,38].

Adults should be aware of the potential to confuse
children when their communication contains a mix of factual
information and euphemisms. Furthermore, parents should
bear in mind that their communications about death affect
both their children’s emerging understanding and how
their children will approach the topic in their turn.

Media portrayals that address death frankly (e.g. Mister
Rogers, Lion king) may be valuable resources for teaching
children the realities of death. At the same time, parents
should be on the lookout to counteract beliefs and attitudes
that might arise from children’s exposure to inaccurate
media portrayals of death.
