BERRILL ON STUDIES IN TUNICATE DEVELOPMENT

differentiation of the larval tissues and to an acceleration in the rate of cell-division
in the permanent tissues. The development of the larval chordate structure and of
the permanent ascidian structure are virtually independent of one another. This
is confirmed by the facts recorded in a previous study (BERRILL, 1929) that in the
Molgulidae the development of the larval chordate organization may be completely
suppressed without interfering with the normal development of the permanent
structure. REFERENCES
