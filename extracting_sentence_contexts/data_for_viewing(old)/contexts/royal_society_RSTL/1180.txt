not such as have arisen from want of attention, but on the
contrary from more than common and long inspection,

Whoever looks a long while at two stars which are equal,
A and B for instance, will find that he is not always pleased
with the expression A. B, but would incline rather to put
them down A, B when A seems to have the preference, or
A*B when the advantage is on the side of B. Since, therefore,
these three expressions A*<B A.B A,B seem equally to
belong to the stars, my compound character A{B is in that
instance an useful one, which includes them all. This may

Seem to be a doubtful expression, but it is in fact a very po-
sitive one, amounting to Aâ€”= B, For had the stars not been
perfectly equal, the same causes which bring on these little
waverings in the appearance of stars, whatever they are, would
have operated so as perhaps to produce the comparative wa-

denotes the union of the three expressions A.B and A,B and
A-B. But if this had been the case, we could certainly not
admit A=B.

Sometimes, when I was not willing to put down these com-
pound marks, I have cast my eyes upon the ground, and after
a few moments lifted them quickly up to the stars AB, and
