Using a similar notation to that on p. 478, we have as the equation of condition

where the temperatures are measured from that of the surrounding envelope. For the sake of simplicity we can assume that the values of a and M

If there had been no radiation, p = 0, and the equation of condition would
been d0/dt = p. Integrating, and using the same constant as before

If we find the points of intersection of (2) and (3) one point (— %, 0) is that
which the experiment commenced, the other (@, T) is the point on (2) at which t
radiation is eliminated,

It is more convenient, for experimental work, to obtain an expression involving
rather than ©; substituting therefore the value of @ given by (3) in (2), we obtain

This equation can be solved for T when the values of d, , 0) are known. In order to obtain A, ~, we can take the following observations: Commence
