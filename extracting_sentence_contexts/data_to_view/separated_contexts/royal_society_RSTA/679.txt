intensity, as it penetrates (more and more slowly) into the interior of the conductor, If n = 2 it will remain constant in intensity, while if n>2 it will decrease. The total
amount of induced current will, of course, continually decrease, in spite of the fact that,
for n= 1, the maximum intensity will continually increase. This implies that the
maximum becomes more and more sharp as py is decreased (see, for example, fig. 3)
