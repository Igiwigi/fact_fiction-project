There is, however, no a priori reason why such a situation should
ever arise. The amplitude might indefinitely increase and the period indefinitely increase
in such a manner that the downward acceleration never does become equal to or greater
than g. Our equations to the fifth order give strong presumptive evidence that there is in
fact a limiting wave height. The numerical value of A in the stationary wave of maximum amplitude may be obtained
from (68), using our earlier expressions for Â©. There are two reasons why it is necessary to
go to high-order harmonics in order to get reasonable numerical accuracy.
