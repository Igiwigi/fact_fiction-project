such as exists in the primary placenta.

142 J. P. HILL ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY OF THE PRIMATES.

Though there are no endometrial thickenings around the placentas, apart from a
slight edematous swelling round the primary, SELENKA figures and describes numerous
cell-nests in the endometrial tissue below and around the secondary placenta as well
as below the margins and more sparsely below the central region of the primary, many
of which have become syncytial. He regards them as of similar origin to the nests
in KeimS. and blastocyst Lk., but in view of the fact that the neck portions of the uterine
glands shown in his fig. 28 have disappeared, the possibility that some of them at least
may be of gland epithelial origin cannot be excluded.

It will be evident from the foregoing that our knowledge of the placentation of
blastocyst Ca is not of a very detailed character. It is therefore fortunate that we
have available another early Catarrhine stage, viz., the early placenta of Macacus
nemestrinus described by Dr. W. H. L. Duckworru (’07) in 1907 which appears to be,
if anything, just a little older than that of Keim Ca. Through the great kindness of
Dr. Duckwortu I have been enabled to study his sections of this important stage and
to provide four new figures (figs. 100-103) to illustrate the details of its structure. The
following account is based on Dr. Duckworru’s description, supplemented by my own
observations. I shall refer to the specimen as Macacus placenta (DUCKWoRTH).
