The hypothesis of the existence of intermediate compounds, formed with the water-
vapour present in the gas mixture, leads us to equations which represent the
phenomena observed, at any rate qualitatively. The catalytic action of the water-
vapour in this case is due to its taking an essential part in the process of combination,
The action is therefore on this theory more than a mere quickening of the action
which would go on slowly without the catalyser. It is possible that the action takes
place very slowly in dry gases, but it seems probable that, if so, it occurs in a different
way, as for example, by the direct combination of dissociated atoms. The function of
the water-vapour we have assumed to be to form a centre about which the hydrogen
and chlorine molecules can assemble, so that the atoms come into each other's spheres
of action and can re-arrange themselves, giving rise to a system of greater stability.
This process we have supposed to take place by the formation of molecular compounds,
and we have seen that a great many of the facts are explained on this hypothesis.
We can regard this catalytic action as not essentially different from the catalytic
action of such substances as platinum black. In these cases the gases in the action,
helped by such a catalyser, probably form condensed layers on the catalyser, and thus
the actual molecules of the combining gases are brought into very intimate contact,
and re-arrangement of the atoms may take place.

In the particular case of the hydrogen and chlorine action, we have evidence of an
unstable water-chlorine molecule, or, at any rate, aggregate, formed at the expense of
the energy of the light, and it seems probable that in the case of other actions
conditioned by the presence of water-vapour, the action proceeds by the aid of similar
intermediate compounds. If this be so, we have seen how the action may not proceed
in the way indicated by the ordinary theory, and so we have an explanation of the
