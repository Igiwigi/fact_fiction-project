polar distance, for 1830-0. The manner in which these elements are obtained
from the rough observations, or the process of reduction employed throughout
the work, will be fully stated in an Appendix annexed to the ohservations, as
well as other matters of detail which may be advantageously deferred. Under

. the head of each nebula, as above mentioned, all its observations are brought
together, and for distinetness' sake, the hour and minute in R, and the degree
in N.P.D. are only once set down for each, viz. in the upper line, or that which
contains the earliest R of each. When the subsequent observations in A fall
into the next minute, the seconds are counted on beyond 60; and when those
in polar distance pass into the next degree, the same contrivance, i. e. counting
the minutes beyond 60, is resorted to, to avoid doubling the initial entries and
80 misleading the eye. When no A. or no P.D. has been observed, the fact is
indicated by dotted lines. When only a rough approximation has been obtained
(a case unfortunately too common), or when, none having been procured, the
