Now make ¢/a so small that ¢ < /3v, which we can always do so long as » is finite.
Then the difference between the two series is numerically < », and the approximation
holds.

If, however, for any value of z, it becomes impossible to assign an upper limit to
li, or R,, v.e., if either series cease to be uniformly convergent, then we should have
to inerease v indefinitely in order to make |R,| < 7/3, and therefore to modify ¢, so

that no limiting value of c/a (which should, of course, be independent of z) could be
found, and the approximation need not necessarily hold. As a matter of fact, it is
shown in § 29 to fail for particular cases. This is true d fortiori, if either series cease
to be convergent at all.

The same remarks apply in their entirety to the process of approximation given in
§ 6, and further, to the approximate expressions given by Professor PocHHAMMER in
his investigation on the bending of beams (‘Crelle,’ vol. 81).
