disordered diamond and diaphite domains. These nanostructured elements are intimately
intergrown, giving rise to structural features erroneously associated with h diamond. Our
data suggest that the diffuse scattering in XRD and the hexagonal features in transmission
electron microscopy images reported from various natural and laboratory-prepared samples
that were previously used for lonsdaleite identification, in fact arise from cubic/hexagonal
stacking disordered diamond and diaphite domains. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Exploring the length scales, timescales and chemistry
of challenging materials (Part 2)’.

]. Introduction

Between 1967 and 1968, hexagonal (h) diamond was described from laboratory samples [1,2], 2S
from the Canyon Diablo and Goalpara meteorites [3] and as the newly named mineral lonsdaleite : 2
from the Canyon Diablo iron meteorite [4].
