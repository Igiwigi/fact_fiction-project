variance, even when the random component of variance is quite small relative to the auto-
regressive component. Nor is it likely that such deviations from the true autoregressive law
will be detected by examination of the correlogram, particularly as the two types of disturb-
ance produce effects which tend to mask each other in the correlogram.

An alternative approach would be to use the estimates of E, and D,, instead of 7? and D,,
in order to determine 6, and hence S,,. This eliminates disturbances due to long-term varia-
tion, but there is still substantial underestimation of S, when there is a superimposed random
component. S, is also seriously affected by errors of estimation in E,.

We therefore reach the conclusion, from the study of the effects of simple disturbances on
the autoregressive type of variation, that no reliable estimate of the systematic sampling
variance can be obtained from the values of a single systematic sample. The fact of the
matter is that it is impossible to predict the behaviour of a sequence or function at inter-
mediate values from the known values at the equally spaced sampling points, unless the
mathematical law of variation is already known. The best estimate that is available from
the values of a single systematic sample appears to be Â£,. The general relation already
