ganglionie cells. Through this layer course upwards the apex processes of its cells as
also those of the great ganglionic series below.

Ganglionic layer. —The cells of this formation are plump, oval, or pyriform bodies,
differing notably from the elongated pyramidal cells of the Sheep and the Pig.
Occasionally a fusiform cell occurs, and more frequently a well-formed pyramid. They
attain the dimensions of 51y x 23p, with a large oval nucleus, measuring 18p, The
nests are usually large and uniform, and most frequently contain from three to four
cells (as seen in vertical sections), One of the larger and richer nests measured
*340 mm. in depth by 093 mm. in breadth, and showed nine cells. The ganglionic
cells are decidedly largest in the gyri bounding the crucial suleus, In a former
investigation into the structure of the gyri in this neighbourhood * the following facts
were elicited, The limbic boundary of this sulcus possessed ganglionic cells averaging
39p X17p, whilsb the parietal boundary of the sulcus contained cells averaging
46ÞX17p, a large number even measuring 69 X 27k. At the external limit of the
crucial suleus, where the parietal gyrus bends round and unites with the limbic lobe,
the largest cells were found (83p X 37), whils an occasional gigantic cell occurred,
attaining the dimensions of 106p X 32p.

The spindle layer calls for no special description here.

Parietal lobe. —On the parietal side of the fisxure of RoLANDo we come upon a 8ix-
laminated type of cortex ; and just as we shall tind that the crucial sulcus presents us
with a different type of structure on its limbic and parietal walls, so here the fissure of
