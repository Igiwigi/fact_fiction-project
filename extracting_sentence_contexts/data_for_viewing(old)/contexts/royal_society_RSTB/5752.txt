In an estimation of the acetic acid produced by hydrolysis from this compound
0-4011 gm. gave acetic acid equivalent to 37-29 c.c. of N/10 acid. This weight of
diacetyl compound, 7.e., C,,H,,O (OCOCH;), would yield 28-64 ¢.c. of N/10 acid and
of a triacetyl compound, 7.e., C,,H,; (OCOCHs), would yield 37-36 c.c. of N/10 acid.
Product A therefore appears to contain three hydroxyl groups which can. be acetylated
with acetic anhydride and sodium acetate, though only two are acetylated by acetic
anhydride and pyridine (see p. 283).

Note on the hydrolysis of the acetyl compound of A.—The non-volatile product from
the hydrolysis of the acetyl product of A consists of a whitish solid residue with a
melting point of 165°-167° C. A mixed melting point of this and product B gave
168°-170° C. Apparently the process of acetylation and deacetylation of Product A
causes racemisation of the optically active compound, a fact which confirms the view
expressed on p. 284 that Products A and B are optical isomerides.
