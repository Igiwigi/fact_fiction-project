chambers, and in it holes are pierced, of such dimensions that the area of each hole is
exactly ¥/2 greater than that of the next to it in one row. One of these holes is
pierced in the plate exactly over the centre of each chamber. Thus we have a series of
graduated intensities of 1, 2, 2%, 2, 2%, 25, 4, &c., falling on the bottom of these cham-
bers when the light falling on them comes from a large and equally illuminated surface.

Paper was exposed in this instrument to the light reflected from a large flat card,
uniformly illuminated by sun and sky light, and after development the blackness was
measured. The paper used was cut from sheets specially prepared by the kindness of
Mr. W. Ws11s, of the Platinotype Company, and the sensitiveness of various parts
was tried, and if found to be constant, the rest of the sheet was taken to be com-
parable with those tried. The care with which this paper is prepared is shown by
the fact that with several varieties of paper, procured at intervals of several months,
the sensitiveness showed no variation in gradation of tints. Latterly the formula
seems to have been a little changed, and the sensitometer curve has slightly varied
from that found at first; but this is unimportant, as the results are so reduced as to
be comparable.

The term “developing” when applied to this paper may be a little misleading. It
must not be confounded with the development of plates containing silver salts. In
the case of this sensitive paper the amount of platinum deposited is exactly
dependent on the amount of the ferric oxalate reduced by light, and if it be exposed
to the developing solution after the ferrous salt has reduced the platinum salt in
contact with it, no more platinum will be deposited. Hence the deposit of platinum
is an exact equivalent of the iron salt reduced, and is a measure of the intensity of
