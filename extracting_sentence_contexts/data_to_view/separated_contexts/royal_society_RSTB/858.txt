We have so far failed to
distinguish the connective tissue cells in the skin, but hope to resume this part of
the investigation with more satisfactory results at some future time. The present
section merely deals with the minute relations of the coloration elements as seen in
sections stained or unstained. The first fact to be mentioned is that the pigment is not exclusively confined to the
derma, but occurs in some cases also in the epidermis. A typical instance of this is
afforded by the Flounder where, in any section of the upper side of the skin, black
pigment is seen in the epidermis. Coloured pigments are not seen in sections,
because they are dissolved out by the alcohol in the process of preparation.
