maximum value of 7 in the vicinity of the waveguide as a function of frequency. (c) |E|? and 53 for the three modes at the same
frequency in this waveguide (indicated by points in (a)). 53 in the first panel has been inverted to account for the fact the group
velocity of the mode is in the opposite direction to the other two. The final panel is the resulting mixture of these modes.

and spin-path entanglement, and we must move to frequencies where the waveguide is just a
single mode, limiting us to group velocities vg > c/6.

7. Conclusion

In summary, we have used calculations of the eigenmodes of photonic crystal waveguides to
investigate the local chirality effects in the slow-light regime. Owing to the reciprocal nature of
light, each mode must have a time-reversal partner, meaning that non-degenerate standing waves
at the bandedge must not contain any chirality. We show that this requirement is met in W1
photonic crystal waveguides when pairs of left- and right-handed C-points collide and annihilate
