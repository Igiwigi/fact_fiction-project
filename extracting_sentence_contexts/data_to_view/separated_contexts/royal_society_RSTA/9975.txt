In the case of the forenoon maximum there is exact agreement in the hour in
eight months, and the mean lag in barometric pressure for the 12 months is only
+ hour. :

December is the only month when the afternoon minima accord in time, and the
mean lag for the barometric pressure is 14 hours. The corresponding quantity for
the afternoon maxima is 24 hours. If the relation is a case of cause and effect, the fact that it is the barometer curve
that lags relative to the other would naturally lead one to regard the potential
variation rather as the cause than the effect.

ยง 28. When we consider the variation from month to month in the amplitudes of
the diurnal inequalities other differences appear. This will be seen on comparing
Table XVII. with Tables IIT. and.
