It seemed natural to try rock salt, which has
been so much used in researches on crystal structure. Fresh cleavage surfaces were
sputtered and heated, and a variety of markings obtained, but the whole film
became discoloured, probably due to the action of the chlorine ions on the metal
of the film, and it did not seem safe to draw any conclusions. The observations
were further complicated by the fact that there was a variety of faults which were

visible under the microscope, each of which causes a local disturbance in the heated
film. A critical test case was furnished by the natural faces of diamond crystals. Rosertson, Fox, and Martn,ยง in their comprehensive study of the physical pro-
perties of diamonds, have clearly established the existence of two types.
