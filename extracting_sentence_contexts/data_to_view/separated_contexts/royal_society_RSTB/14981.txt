Overall, to fully understand community processes, there has to be a balance between a focused approach
to divide complex processes into smaller ones that can be better observed, quantified and characterized mechanistically, and
holistic approaches focusing on the interconnections between system components (figure 1). These holistic approaches to
studying natural habitats more directly can yield complementary data to help deduce the interactions.

3. Insilico approaches for community-level studies

(a) Plankton sampling expeditions in the twenty-first century

As stated previously, collecting information from laboratory-based experiments remains biased by the fact that we are able
to grow only a small fraction of the organisms present in a natural sample. Significant advances in the field have been
made with the development of ‘omics techniques, which have revolutionized our understanding of microbial communities by
disentangling complex information encrypted in a single ecosystem, circumventing the need to grow natural samples in the
laboratory. Typical ‘omics data in phytoplankton community ecology encompass metabarcoding, metagenomics, metatranscrip-
tomics and metabolomics (see Glossary).
