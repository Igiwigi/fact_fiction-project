Even more, despite the developing tie between these statistics and thermodynamics, there
was (so far as I know) very little interest in thinking about the implications for social life of the
thermodynamic laws of entropy. The assumption of progress as an obvious and incontestable
feature of the globe, or of the west, or perhaps only of Anglo American societies, would likely
have made any such inquiries seem silly. In fact, Herbert Spencer, in his First Principles [11, p.
327], emphasized the exact opposite lawâ€”what we might consider a law of reverse entropy. Take a beaker of a fluid warmed to a homogeneous temperature throughout and set it out on
a table, Spencer directed. If you do, you will see that after a while the temperature is no longer
homogeneous.
