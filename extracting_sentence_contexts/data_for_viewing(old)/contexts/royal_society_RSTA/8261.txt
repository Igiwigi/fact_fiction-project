for the coefficient of opacity is derived from observation. Once « is determined, the
coefficient of opacity may be calculated at any desired level in the atmosphere.

The explicit form of (63) has been given elsewhere* for a variety of cases. The
solution is found to be expressible in all cases in the form

where 0 depends on the excitation and ionization potentials concerned but varies only
very slowly with T,,,. The applicability of the method is closely connected with the
fact that (64) is explicitly independent of ¢, the proportion by mass of the element con-
sidered. It has merely been necessary to assume ¢ constant in differentiating.

The physical reason why observation of a maximum determines the general opacity
coefficient is worth considering. The column of atoms has to contain a given total
opacity, +, and at the same time to contain a maximum number of excited atoms, in
order that a line shall be widest for given intensity-ratio. The temperature of maximum
depends on the partial electron-pressure, and this can be thus found from an observed
Tax. We thus know two things about the column—its total opacity and the electron
pressure at its base. From the latter we can infer from consideration of mechanical
equilibrium what is the total mass of the column. Dividing the total mass into the
total opacity we get the opacity per gram, which is precisely the coefficient of opacity.
Using once again the value of Py, we find the constant «. Free electrons play two distinct
