to the rotor plane). The aerodynamic loads are modelled as

pn, )= sev De(r)[Ci(e) cos(p) + Ca(a) sin()] (3.2a)
and
pr t)= sever De(r)[Ci(e) sin() — Ca(a) cos()], (3.2b)

where p is the density of air, V;¢) is the relative wind velocity, C\(q) is the lift coefficient and Cg(@)
is the drag coefficient associated with the blade aerofoil.

Equations (3.1) and (3.2a,b) show that the loads on the wind turbine structure can be alleviated
by appropriately modifying the pitch angle 6. However, careful design of the control algorithm
is required in order to avoid alleviation of loads using the pitch controller from interfering with
power generation. In fact, small changes in pitch angle can have a dramatic effect on the power
output [34]. The application of active pitch control for wind turbine load reduction is presented
in [2,4,36]. Active pitch control interacts strongly with the turbine dynamics, in particular with
the tower dynamics, and under certain circumstances can lead to instability of the active system
if the gains of the controller are not designed properly. For large wind turbines, a significant
amount of force is required and intense mechanical stresses are experienced at the blade root in
order to operate fast and effective pitch control. Further, as mentioned above, major reduction
of the structural loads using active pitch control only is not possible without compromising
on the mechanical power generated by the rotor. The approach suggested in this paper aims
at complementing the application of pitch control with active tendon control. In this way, it
is possible to reduce the burden on active pitch control for load reduction by decoupling the
mitigation of structural loads from the power regulation issue.
