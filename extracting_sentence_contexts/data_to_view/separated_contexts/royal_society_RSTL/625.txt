There are several well known experiments with burning
glasses, which show that the intensity of the heat generated by

the concentration of the solar rays, is not simply as the conden-
sation of those rays, but in a higher proportion ; and, that it -
depends much on their direction, being greater, as the angle is
greater at which they meet at the focus of the lens. That fact is certainly very remarkable, It has often been the
subject of my meditations ; and it has contributed not a little to
the opinion I have been induced to adopt, respecting the nature of
light and of heat. I never could reconcile it with the supposi-
tion that heat is caused by the accumulation of any thing emitted
by the sun; or by any other body which sends off calorific
radiations.

ResERvinG for a future communication, an account of the
sequel of my enquiries respecting the subject which I have un-
dertaken to investigate, I shall conclude this long Paper with
some obseryations, concerning the practical uses that may be
derived from a knowledge of the facts which have been esta-
blished by the results of the foregoing experiments. In all cases where it is designed to preserve the heat of any
Substance which is confined in a metallic vessel, it will greatly
contribute to that end, if the external surface of the vessel
be very clean and bright: but, if the object be to cool any
thing quickly, in a metallic vessel, the external surface of the
vessel should be painted, or covered with some of those sub-
Stances which have been found to emit calorific rays in great
abundance. Polished tea-urns may be kept boiling hot with a much less
expence of spirit of wine (burnt in a lamp under them) than
such as are varnished; and the cleaner and brighter the dishes,
and covers for dishes, are made, which are used for bringing
