Theory of Metamorphosis: Symmetry and Balance.

The metamorphosis of Flat-fishes may be said to arise from an obliquity of growth
superimposed on the ordinary course of development. Few parts develop in the

normal manner or position. Unless we suppose them inherited, these peculiarities
must have a direct cause or direct causes. One question is, therefore, whether the
abnormal or oblique phenomena of development are so related to one another that
direct causation can be d√©duced from their sequence. If so, what is the binding law
of the causation ; or, what theory will best describe the facts ?

With regard to the relation between the phenomena, it is true that the asymmetry
develops in a regular manner, just as if it belonged to the ordinary course of develop-
ment, but if we compare the life histories of different species, we find that the
progressiveness or rate of change from the normal depends upon recognisable factors
(ef. Pleuronectes and Gilyptocephalus, S. vulgaris and S. variegata). Secondly, the
extreme asymmetry peculiar to Flat-fishes, viz., that of the skull, is invariably
preceded by certain changes in the head and body. Hence the possibility of direct
causation may be concluded. A brief survey of the facts, having the adult structure
in mind as well as the development, will show how far this conclusion is justified and
pave the way for a constructive theory.
