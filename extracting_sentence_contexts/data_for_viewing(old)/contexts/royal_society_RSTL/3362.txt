perfect formation of the olive oxide of silyer results.

The iodine vapour requires an equally long time to produce any visible effect upon
this paper, as upon those before mentioned (8. 9.), But half an hour is sufficient to
render this preparation s0 far iodidated as is necessary, or indeed as is possible, with-
out impairing its sensibility.

This iodidated oxide requires a strong light to yield any decided effect, and a
greater heat than is directed by Dacuzrrs must be applied to the mercury to bring
out the impression, which is but faint at last.

10. The protoxide of silver, and some of its salts, now engaged my attention.
Taking adyantage of the facts pointed out by WonrerÂ®, I exposed papers saturated
with a solution of the nitrate of silver, and dried in a cylinder which was kept hot by
boiling water, to a current of very pure heated hydrogen gas. By this means I ob-
tained a paper of a brick-red colour. This appears to be a nitrate of the protoxide of
silver ; by soaking this paper in rain water for 8ome time, the free acid was removed
from it, and on drying it became darker than before.

This paper is not very readily attacked by the iodine, but it is, by the exposure of
an hour to a full volume of its vapour, rendered slightly sensitive.

11. By immersing a paper prepared as above (10.) in a solution of pure potassa,
the salt is decomposed, and the paper on drying becomes a full black, which on
being passed through steel rollers, assumes a fine lustre, resembling that given by
