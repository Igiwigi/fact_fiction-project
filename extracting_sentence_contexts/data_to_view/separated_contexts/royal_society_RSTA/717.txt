imminent transition into folds. This can be attributed to the fact that the critical film strain for
period-doubling increases linearly with substrate prestretch [31]. Thus, for high prestretches,
we again observe periodic wrinkling rather than period-doubling. Although varying prestretch
highly controls secondary wrinkling patterns, we will first focus on the influence of prestretch
on the evolution of primary wrinkling and exclusively analyse corresponding data.
