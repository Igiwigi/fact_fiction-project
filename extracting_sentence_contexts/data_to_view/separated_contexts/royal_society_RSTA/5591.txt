However, there is an important technical caveat:
the set K’ has to be sufficiently large in a topological sense. A sufficient condition is that K’ c R4
has nonempty interior, but a key point in Tartar’s framework is that certain (linear or nonlinear)
constraints may restrict K’ to a lower-dimensional variety—a concrete example will be presented
below in the context of MHD turbulence. Combining the general framework of Tartar in (2.2) and (2.3) with techniques developed for
the existence theory of vectorial differential inclusions (2.4) leads to the following basic principle
(again formulated in an imprecise way, ignoring technical side conditions):

PRINCIPLE II: Typical elements of S are in fact elements of S. Here again ‘typical’ refers to Baire category. As such, using this principle to prove the existence
of solutions invariably leads to weak solutions with often paradoxical properties which are
highly irregular.
