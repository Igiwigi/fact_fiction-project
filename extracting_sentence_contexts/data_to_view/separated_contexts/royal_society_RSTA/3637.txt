A more realistic model of a film bonded to a uniform elastic ball would replace our =
Winkler term with a non-local expression involving the H'/? norm of the surface displacement : 3
(see for example [17] or §3 of [18]). This suggests replacing our Winkler term by

(which scales once again like length”). In fact, our analysis of the lower bound would also work : s
for this non-local substrate term. However, our analysis of the upper bound requires estimating at
the energy of an explicitly given deformation, which would be much more difficult for a non-
local model. Moreover, the use of (2.2) would not eliminate another key idealization, namely
that the sheet is free to slip along the substrate.
