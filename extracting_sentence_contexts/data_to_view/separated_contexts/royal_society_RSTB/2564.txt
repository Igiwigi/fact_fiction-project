36, the part of the body wall to which the
mesenteries are attached becomes gradually more and more invaginated, raised
up on the growing ends of the synapticular bars, but still descending to the base of
the polyp between the bars of any one interseptal loculus. Bocrne did not make a special study of the skeletal, but of the anatomical
relations, and his views with regard to the synapticule rested chiefly on previous
observations made by Epwarps and Harme and by Duncan.* He says, in fact, at

the conclusion of his paper that he “

can offer no explanation of the origin and
significance of the synapticula. Physiologically they seem to serve as stays or
buttresses giving solidity and coherence to the corallum.” The structural support which they give is possibly their main function, in this
respect they tuke the place of the dissepiments of Astreidea.
