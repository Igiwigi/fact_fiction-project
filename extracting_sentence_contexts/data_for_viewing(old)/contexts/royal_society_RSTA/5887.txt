Proof. Given i,i’ € {1,2} andj € {1,...,d}, we let
Mii J) = (—Difrlpey,

and we let ¢j ;; be the solution of the transport equation (2.2) with vector field uj, ;. We denote by
ri; the image of $29 under the flow map of the shear flow u;,; after time T. Since
Git f(t) = B(x — (—DfirloG) Fe),
we compute
Ib — (Di felaptopd k= j,

We square the expression above and sum over i, i’. Using the fact that }>, fF = A’, integrating over
riz; and changing variables back to the original domain 29 gives

Summing over k € {1,...,d} andj {1,...,d} then shows that
