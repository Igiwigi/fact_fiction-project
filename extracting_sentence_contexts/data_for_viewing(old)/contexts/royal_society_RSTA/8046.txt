the models, since the side-chains are distributed along the main-chains so as to lie in
planes of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate sides of the main-
chains leads to an “ identity period ” of 6-8 A.

The Intramolecular Elastic Mechanism.

The intramolecular long-range elasticity of keratin is so striking as to invite the
closest study, for the principles underlying it, or principles sufficiently analogous, must
lie also at the bottom of numerous other dimensional changes in biological structures,
notably those occurring in muscle. On approaching the problem it is natural to consider
once more the elastic behaviour of silk fibroin, which constitutes probably the simplest
protein fibre available. X-rays show why silk fibroin has no long-range elasticity ; it
is, in fact, because its long-chain molecules are normally in a fully-extended state com-

parable to that found in hair only when under extension; but the question arises
immediately as to whether it is possible to contract the fibroin molecule into some folded
state comparable to that found in normal, unstretched hair. Now it is known that
silk fibres, under the action of acids within certain narrow limits of concentration,
contract spontaneously,* and so an X-ray examination of this effect was carried out.
Photographs were taken of silk threads of “ electrical tram + which had been treated
