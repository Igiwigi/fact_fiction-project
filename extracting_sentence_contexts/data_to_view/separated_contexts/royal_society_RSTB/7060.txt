In both
the above experiments brother-sister matings were used, and in a third set cross-mated
individual females of both families were used. From these results it was apparent that there was no definite simple genetical basis
for the occurrence of diapause, the number of families with high and low percentage of
diapause being similar in all three sets. However, an interesting fact did emerge, namely, that the age of the parent female when
an egg is laid has some bearing on the tendency of the larva hatching from it to go into
diapause. To illustrate this the results of ten of the above experiments are shown in table 1
and figure 1. Only the averages from the ten experiments are given, but each individual
family shows the same trend, namely, that the percentage of progeny entering diapause
increases with the age of the parent female at the time of oviposition.
