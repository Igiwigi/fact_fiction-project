per second, though those which are ordi-
narily registered at the commencement of this phase have not a greater apparent rate
of travel than about 3Â°5 kiloms. per second. +

If, instead of the very indeterminate commencement of this phase, we take the
more easily determinable time of the maximum movement, we find, as shown in the
table below, that greater uniformity of result which might be expected to follow
from the fact that the recorded times are less influenced by variations in the sensi-
tiveness of the different instruments. * The miuimum values may be neglected, as they are evidently due to a tardiness in action of the
instruments.
