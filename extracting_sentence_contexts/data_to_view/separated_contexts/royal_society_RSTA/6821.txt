This question is discussed more fully
in ยง 4-5 below, without reaching any definite conclusion apart from the negative one that,
with the data available, one cannot predict any discrete periods or band of periods likely
to be due to internal waves. On the other hand, the evidence discussed in both earlier papers
(Bowden 1947; Bowden & Proudman 1949) shows that the long-period fluctuations, like
those of short period, have features consistent with their being turbulent in character. In
the present investigation, the fluctuations have been analyzed as a single set, but if they fell
naturally into two bands of periods, this fact might have been expected to emerge. It is therefore suggested that the current fluctuations which have been observed, through-
out the whole range of periods, should be regarded as similar in character and probably all

associated with the turbulent flow of the tidal current. The discussion from ยง 4-6 onwards
is based on this hypothesis.
