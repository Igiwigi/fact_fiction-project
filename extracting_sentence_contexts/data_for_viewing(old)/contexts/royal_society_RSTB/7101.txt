92 H. G. CANNON ON THE ANATOMY

The tergum and scutum which, as I have said, form on either side the wall of the mantle
entrance, articulate with each other by an S-shaped joint (figure 1). This, incidentally, is
much more marked in L. valentiana than it is in L. dorsalis. Now, it is obvious from the
figure that if the terga can be moved away from each other they will carry the scuta with
them. The tergum and scutum on either side will thus act like a single plate. That this is so
is clear from the fact that the two plates are sometimes fused together across the S-shaped
joint by tubes of encrusting forms (e.g. specimen 14, Great Barrier Reef collection, Cannon
1935, p- 5).

Darwinâ€™s muscle system consists of a band of fibres running parallel to the circular
muscles of the peduncle, but joining the lower carinal margins of the terga with the carina,
and, more important, with each other (figure 2a,b). There is thus a small but definite
