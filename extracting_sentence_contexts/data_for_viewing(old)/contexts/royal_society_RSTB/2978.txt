The configuration of the lining of the canopy is somewhat as follows: At its
insertion upon the edge of the plinth the organ shows. the beginnings of nine radial
grooves which deepen as the micropyle is approached. Alternating with these
grooves are an equal number of projecting cushions, the convexities of which are
directed towards the axis of the seed. This folded organ, resembling an umbrella
being opened against a gust of wind, is the internal boundary of the free integument,
and by the junction of its upper deeply folded part with the outside wall gives
rise to the characteristic “chambers” of this part of the seed. But even after the
chambers are complete the double nature of the septa can still be detected. This is
shown in W. 1915, M. (Plate 7, fig. 1), also in the oblique Manchester K,. 14257
(Plate 9, fig. 20), and in the still more oblique Krpsron 424 (fig. 25), In U. C. L,,
R. 9, ¢ (Plate 5, phot. 10), where the septa are perfectly double, the appearance depends
on the fact that they are cut almost longitudinally and not through the narrowest
parts of the grooves (for the position of this section ef: text-fig. 1, U. C. L., R. 9, e).

The relation of the canopy to the sinus between it and the pollen-chamber is well
illustrated by a reference to phot. 9, a longitudinal and slightly oblique section
through the canopy. The plane of section cuts the plinth midway between its
margin and the base of the pollen-chamber. It cuts the chamber of the canopy
about its axis almost at right angles, and of course the gaping portions of the two
grooves, being cut at right angles, are seen at a minimum. The walls of the left-hand
