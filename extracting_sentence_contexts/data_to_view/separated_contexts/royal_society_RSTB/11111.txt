The interpretation of these
additional mixture events is unclear. For example, in one
replication, an additional mixture event was signified by an
arrow from Blagdon in the West to Great Strickland in the
North. After the fact, we examined the PC scores of the dia-
lects and noted that Great Strickland was placed on a branch
with other northern dialects that all have roughly the same
PC2, PC3 and PC4 scores. However, Great Strickland was in question have accumulated changes since the seventeenth
