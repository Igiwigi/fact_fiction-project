several times the depth of the fluids, one can expect that the damping arising from mensicus
waves will be minimized, yet discrete modes can appear at the onset of the instability. This is
what the figure also depicts.

There are other comments on the figure that may be made. First, as expected from the inviscid
case, the curve is not monotonic depicting minima in the thresholds for various modes. The
lowest or minimum point in each modal range is very close to the systemâ€™s natural frequency
and coincides with it only in the limit of vanishing viscosity. This implies that the Faraday
forcing method is a plausible way to experimentally estimate the natural frequencies provided the
Reynolds number is high. Of course, as we saw earlier, more modes creep in the vicinity when
the effect of viscosity is reduced. As a case in point near the 5 Hz location, we have three modes
in the inviscid case, i.e. (1,1), (5,1) and (2,2), but only one survives, i.e. (1,1), when viscosity
is added, this being the least choppy one. In fact, near the frequency of 4.5 Hz, a choppier but
harmonic mode, (1,2) that is slightly more stable is depicted and is forecast from table 2. The
closeness of the modes makes it difficult to discern the behaviour when modes are close to one
another. A second observation is that the peaks of the curve represent the transition of one modal
