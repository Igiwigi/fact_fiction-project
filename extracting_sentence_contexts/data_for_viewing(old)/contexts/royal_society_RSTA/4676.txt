turbulence model is to increase the diffusion in the solution. Dos

There are two related issues which compound this picture. The first is numerical artefacts, : =
which often also introduce diffusion into the solution. Even for higher order methods, these Sy
methods are invariably only first order near discontinuities or large gradients. The numerical 2
truncation errors are of the same type and sign as the SGS terms. More serious is the unfortunate aed
fact that they are typically large and can be larger than the SGS terms. The ultimate factor 22
contributing to the solution morphology is not only these physical transport terms and the : Ss
numerically based turbulent transport terms, but their dimensionless ratios, such as the Schmidt : s
number Sc = v/D, where v is the viscosity and D is the species diffusion, with a similar definition : s
for the dimensionless Prandtl number Pr governing thermal diffusion. The numerical problem 18

arises from the fact that the dimensionless ratio of combined effects transport (physical, or
molecular, turbulent or grid dependent; and numerical, or algorithmic dependent) is typically
perturbed by the numerical truncation error contribution, and due to the sign restriction on the
SGS turbulent transport term, this error cannot be compensated for by adjusting its coefficient.

Thus, we see that the SGS terms only address one half of the physics-based non-uniqueness.
The other half is addressed by a high-quality numerical algorithm, which minimizes numerical
error, especially in the equations where it is typically the largest: thermal and concentration
diffusion. The front tracking addresses the numerical issue, which controls, or limits, diffusion in
the presence of a sharp interface or steep thermal or concentration gradient. We call the algorithm
FT/LES/SGS, as it combines and depends essentially upon front tracking, large eddy simulation
and dynamically constructed SGS terms.
