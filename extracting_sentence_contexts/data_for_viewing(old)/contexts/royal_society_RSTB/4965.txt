396 MR. J. BARCROFT AND OTHERS: OBSERVATIONS UPON THE EFFECT OF

The first comparison which we would make, and as it seems to us the proper
starting point, is that between the pulse under basal conditions at sea-level and at
Cerro de Pasco. In making this comparison, we would draw attention to the fact
