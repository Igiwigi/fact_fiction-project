ANNANDALE and
Ropinson have kindly furnished me in advance with the following statement, which has not yet
appeared :—

“One of the women of a Semang or aboriginal tribe in the Siamese Malay State of Jalor volunteered
the information that the women of her race only had children about March, that is, immediately after the
wet season, and that each woman normally had a child every year at this season, as long as she was
capable of child-bearing.”

Iam indebted to Messrs. ANNANDALE and Roprnson for permission to make use of this very interesting
information, which, so far as I am aware, is among the most direct evidence of a restricted sexual season
in a primitive race. (Cf. “ Fasciculi Malayenses, Anthropology,” Part I, now issued.—May 15th.)

+ It is possible that the follicle referred to was not sufficiently advanced towards maturation to admit
of rupture, since it did not show any indication of atresia, so far as I observed. But this may quite well
be explained by the fact that the ewe was killed only on the day following the detection of cestrus, and
possibly but a few hours after the termination of that estrus; so that the follicle might not have begun
to degenerate. I am unable to state when the polar bodies are extruded in the case of the sheep.
