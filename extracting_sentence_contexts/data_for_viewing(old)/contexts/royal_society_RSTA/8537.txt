Substituting for ¢,,,,(0) by equation (7), we obtain the formula

2 and uw being both positive or both negative.

This is an interesting formula, in the fact that the odd nwmbers occur in an unusual
way in the denominator. The writer has, however, obtained also another proof on
different lines, which is not included in this discussion.

Similar considerations apply to functions of even order. Without giving the whole
argument again, we may quote the results as follows :—
