1500. It may very properly be said with respect to the experiments, that the large
negative ball is as essential to the discharge as the small positive ball, and also that
the large negative ball shows as much superiority over the large positive ball (which
is inefficient in causing a spark from its opposed small negative ball) as the small
positive ball does oyer the small negative ball ; and probably when we understand
the real canse of the difference, and refer it rather to the condition of the particles
of the dielectric than to the sizes of the conducting balls, we may find much im-
portance in such an observation. But for the present, and whilst engaged in inves-
tigating the point, we may admit, what is the fact, that the forces are of higher in-
tensity at the surfaces of the smaller balls than at those of the larger (1372. 1374.) ;
that the former, therefore, determine the discharge, by first rising up to that exalted
condition which is necessary for it ; and that, whether brought to this condition by
induction towards the walls of a room or the large balls I have used, these may fairly
be compared one with the other in their influence and actions.

1501. The conclusions I arrive at are: first, that when two equal small conducting
surfaces equally placed in air are electrified, one positively and the other negatively,
that which is negative can discharge to the air at a tension a little lower than that
required for the positive ball : second, that when discharge does take place, much
more passes at each time from the positive than from the negative surface (1491.). The last conclusion is very abundantly proved by the optical analysis of the positive
and negative brushes already described (1468.), the latter set of discharges being
found to recur five or six times oftener than the former*.
