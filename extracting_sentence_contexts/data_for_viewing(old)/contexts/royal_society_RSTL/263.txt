from the effect of a partial compression of this kind.

From this statement it appears, that unless some very strong
facts can be. produced, to disprove the probability, that the
relative angular position of the. parts constituting a ship may
always be materially altered, without an absolute failure of
strength, it cannot be denied that the principle of oblique
bracing offers a remedy for the tendency to arch, whatever
doubts there may be of the efficacy of any particular mode of
applying it. And even if no obgservations could be produced
in confirmation of the frequent occurrence of such a change
of the angular situation of the timbers, the suppoxition that the
stiffness could be perfect in this respect, notwithstanding the
unequal 'shrinking of the timbers, and other similar circum-
stances, while the ultimate strength gave way by' the failure
of the fastenings, is in itself so highly improbable, that no
