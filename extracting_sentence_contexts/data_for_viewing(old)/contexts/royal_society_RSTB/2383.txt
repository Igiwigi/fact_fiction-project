xylem. The elements of the xylem form a narrow band, often reduced to one
tracheid in width, and occasionally interrupted by xylem-parenchyma; numerous
groups of protoxylem occur on the inner edge of the xylem (fig. 25, px.). The
meristele is thus endarch, while the xylem of the rhizome stele is mesarch in
structure. The protoxylem strands, of which there may be as many as fifty, are
very clearly shown in sections of young leaf-stalks stained with gentian violet
and eosin. Next the protoxylem strands the tissue is often more or less torn,
forming a fairly regular canal or an irregular gap. A striking characteristic of the
internal phloem is the occurrence of groups of tannin sacs between each protoxylem
group (Plate 49, fig. 25, ¢.). A few secretory cells occur also in the external phloem.
The groups of secretory sacs, which form a conspicuous feature in the petiole stele
(Plate 47, fig. 3, t.), are formed at an early stage in the development of the leaf; in
fact, they appear to be among the earliest differentiated elements. The secretory
elements are clearly shown in the section of a fairly young petiole, reproduced in
Plate 47, fig. 5, t.

The diagrammatic sections shown in Text-figure | illustrate the behaviour of the
petiole stele as it alters its form a short distance below the summit of the petiole, and

tissue indicate the position and number of the protoxylem strands. A short distance
