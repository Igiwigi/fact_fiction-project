throws upon phenomena previously observed in the course of experiments with
expansion apparatus. ;

All the former measurements which I have published upon the least expansion
required to make condensation take place in presence of ions, are now seen to have
been concerned with negative ions only. One example of interest is the case of nuclei
produced by a zine plate exposed to ultra-violet light. When the plate was negatively
charged, nuclei were found to be present, requiring an expansion, v,/v, = 1Â°25, to make

water condense on them; a fact in agreement with the results of the present investi-
gation, since negative ions were, in this case, plainly in question. The absence of fog
when the expansion was made with the field reversed was, however, as we now see,
no proof that no ions escape from the positively charged plate, for the expansions used
were insufficient to cause water to condense on positive ions had they been present.
Another case of interest is that of the nuclei produced by the discharge from a point.
Even when positive electricity was escaping from the point, fogs were obtained with
expansions which are now seen to have been insufficient to catch positive ions. We
are therefore driven to the conclusion that the positive discharge does not consist
simply in the escape of positive ions from the point of the wire, but that negative ions
(or nuclei of some other kind than ions) are present as well, possibly produced by the
action upon the moist air of the radiation from the glowing point of the wire.
