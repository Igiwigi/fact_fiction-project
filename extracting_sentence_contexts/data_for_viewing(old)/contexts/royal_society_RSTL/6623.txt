[S Another but less probable view of the change presents itself in the supposition that

-2 the three atoms of ethyl in boric ethide were already present in the boracic ether, the
@ action of the zincethyl being simply to remove the whole of the oxygen from the boracic
> ether, KEKULEF has in fact adopted this latter view of the reaction.

= So long as the organic radical of the zine compound and that of the boracic ether are
& Aidentical, it is impossible to prove whether the three individual atoms of ethyl in boric
= ethide were originally present in the boracic ether, or have been derived from the zinc-
Ss ethyl. Indicating by an asterisk the atoms of ethyl which tinally become part of the
— boric ethide, it is impossible to prove conclusively whether the reaction takes place
V according to the first or second of the following equations :—
