Correspondingly, one considers a nonlinear
function for the linearized strain Â¢ = f(T). Hence implicit constitutive theory leads to a small strain
theory allowing for a nonlinear relationship between the linearized strain and the stress [4,5]. The notion strain-limiting refers to the response of materials which are characterized by the fact
that, once the strain reaches a certain limiting value, a further increase in stress will not cause any
changes in strain. Such models have recently attracted a considerable amount of attention due
to the fact that various phenomena, including cracks, are successfully described. In the classical
linear elasticity theory such nonlinear response cannot be explained.
