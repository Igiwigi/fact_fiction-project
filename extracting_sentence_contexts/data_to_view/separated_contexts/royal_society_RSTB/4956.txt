All the usual places for the insertion of pinne
are occupied in its immediate vicinity, so that it is not likely to be a modified pinna. If the specimen is examined closely it will be seen that this fertile rachis slants down into
the matrix to the left, in a direction that would carry it beneath the rachis of that arm
of the frond which lies nearest to it, and also in the direction of the angle of the fork
of the main rachis. Another important fact to notice is that there is an object in the
angle of the fork, which appears in the photograph as a small black spot (Plate 17, fig. 24, d). This structure actually consists of two small cavities, at the bottom of which one can see
carbonaceous matter. These cavities represent the cast of some organic body which
was in connection with the frond in the angle between the two arms of the frond.
