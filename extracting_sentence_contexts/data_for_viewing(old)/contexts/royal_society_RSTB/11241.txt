The second main point refers to the question whether these effects are
specific to interoceptive processes. The authors argue that the study lacks a
control condition not related to interoceptive processes targeting attention
processes or working memory performance in general that might be affected
by frontal stimulation. We want to argue against the claim that attention
processes or working memory performance in general might underlie the
observed results after frontal stimulation. Effects of inhibiting somatosensory
cortices were comparable in many aspects to effects of inhibiting AI, both on
performance level as well as on EEG level as assessed by the HEP. These results
contradict the idea that a change in interoceptive processes might be due to side
effects of the TMS frontal stimulation site and therefore a general effect of affecting
attention or working memory circuits. We in contrast argue that the fact that
major results were comparable between stimulation sites aiming to inhibit AI
http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2016.0506. and somatosensory cortices is a strong empirical evidence that indeed nodes of

the interoceptive network were affected by TMS and that these effects were
specific for interoceptive processes and are not related to other main functions
