Since

Summing over k € {1,...,d} andj {1,...,d} then shows that

Since there are 4d terms on the sum on the left, there must exist one term that is at least a 1/(4d)
fraction of the right-hand side. This immediately yields (2.3) as claimed. a


Our next task is to show that for any (non-constant) initial datum, we can find a smooth
compactly supported divergence-free vector field in R@ for which the solution to the transport
equation grows exponentially in H'.
