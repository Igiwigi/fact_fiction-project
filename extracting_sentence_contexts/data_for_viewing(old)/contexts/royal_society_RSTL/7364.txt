found (< 85) that the specific heat of artificially prepared (uncrystalline?) and crystal-
lized titanic acid did not differ. According to my investigations ({ 48) silicic acid has
almost the same specific heat in the crystallized and in the amorphous condition.

In individual cases, where the specific heat of the same substance for the amorphous
and crystallized modification has been found to be materially different*, it may be shown
that foreign influences affected the determination for the one condition. Such influ-
ences are especially: 1. That one modification absorbed heat of softening at the tem-
perature of the experiment ; that is doubtless the reason why the specific heat of yellow

* Ds 14 Rrivs and Mancer (Ann. de Chim, et de Phys. [2] vol. Ixxv. p. 118) found the specific heat of
vitreous to be different from that of opaque arsenious acid, and considered the fact to be essential ; but their
method was not fitted to establish" 8nch a difference. Parz's view, too (Poacexvorer's Annalen, vol. exx.
PP- 341 and 342), that it is of essential importance for the specific heat of hydrated sulphates whether the salts
are crystallized or not, does not appear to me to be proved by what he has adduced.

phosphorus was found to be considerably greater at higher temperatures than that of red

phosphorus, but not at low ones (compare $ 82), that the specific heat of amorphous
