I had no
means of choosing in this respect, and received specimens both from small and large
sows. Moreover, I could not generally ascertain the exact age of the foetus examined,
and have, therefore, to avoid error, only spoken of its length. These facts will explain the results of some measurements, which might otherwise
appear to be contradictory. St. Bartholomew's Hospital,
November 1854.
