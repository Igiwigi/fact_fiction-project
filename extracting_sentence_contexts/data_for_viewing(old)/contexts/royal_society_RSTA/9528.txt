argued that the probable errors of the measurements of the different types of line
are in accord with this grouping, because those lines whose displacements are small
have a smaller probable error than those. with larger values, the latter being in general
(but not invariably) associated with a greater width of the lines. But though this is
a consideration which must be given due weight, to regard it as satisfactorily
accounting for the distribution in fig. 1 would be to disregard the significance of the
tendency for the displacement to increase with wave-length which has been
demonstrated in Diagrams 4 and 5.

It is further important to note that lines as 208 (A = 4762°87), 213 (X = 4829°18),
217 (A = 4856'57), 228 (A = 4936°02) and 238 (A = 5017°75) do not clearly fall within
either group, also that the line 247 (A = 5477°18) is assigned to the group with large
displacement in spite of the fact that it is reversed unsymmetrically, and would not
be expected, in accordance with previous experience of similarly reversed lines in the
iron spectrum, to belong to a group with the highest rate of displacement.

Plotting d/X against wave-length, fig. 2 is obtained, and again the lines 208, 213,
217, 228 and 247 occupy anomalous positions. There is still less reason for regarding
this distribution as satisfactory. Fig. 3 shows the distributions of the values of d/,*
when the lines 247, 213, and 217 form a group by themselves, though 208 has
attached itself to the outskirts of the first group.

In fig. 4, in which the values of d/d* are given, these lines have been absorbed by
Group 1, and the resolution into two groups is clearer. We note also that the second
group is more compact ; this is obviously the most satisfactory diagram, and we may
