EXTRACTION OF BASIC PROTEINS FROM CELL NUCLEI

It has been known since the original work of Miescher (1897) on salmon sperm heads
and the extension of his methods to the nuclei of avian erythrocytes by Kossel (1884)
that basic proteins can be extracted from certain isolated cell nuclei or from nuclear
material by means of dilute mineral acids. This method has, in fact, usually been employed
for the preparation of protamins and histones from fish sperm heads and of histones from
nucleated erythrocytes. Nevertheless, the histone from the thymus gland of the calf,
which is the only member of this group of basic proteins which has hitherto been sub-
mitted to any extensive chemical investigation, has always been prepared by other
methods (Lilienfeld 1894; Felix & Rauch 1931) from the whole gland. The basic proteins
used in the present investigation have, with the exception of that from wheat germ, been
extracted from isolated cell nuclei. This procedure not only ensures that they do, in fact,
originate from the nucleus, but it also constitutes an important step in their purification.

Histones

For the extraction of histones, 2g. of dry cell nuclei are weighed into each 50 ml.
centrifuge tube used. Since dry nuclei do not easily wet with aqueous solvents, they are
stirred with a small amount of absolute alcohol until thoroughly wet with this solvent.
The resulting paste is treated with excess of water and, after mixing, centrifuged. The
clear supernatant liquid is rejected and the solid again brought into fine suspension in
water and left overnight to soak in this solvent. The water is removed by centrifugation
and the solid intimately mixed with 20 ml. of 0-1 N-sulphuric acid. After 20 min., during
which time the mixture is frequently, although not continuously, stirred, the tube is
