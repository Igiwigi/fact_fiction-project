Granting, then, the existence of air streams which vary both in direction and
intensity as proven, the question which now confronted us was: How can these air
streams be best suppressed, or their effects neutralised? As it appeared impossible
to institute any simple or convenient scheme for neutralising the disturbances, an
attempt was made to eliminate their cause.

As a result of earlier experiments, it was known that a delicate bolometer placed
within an ordinary balance case almost invariably reveals the existence of continuous
fluctuations in the temperature of the contained air. In general, the fluctuations
assume the form of minute and somewhat irregular oscillations about some mean
temperature. Such disturbances occurring in the vicinity of the beam may be
reduced to a vanishing point by the simple expedient of enclosing the whole beam
with a small additional inner case. With these facts before us, it was concluded that
the difficulties arising from the presence of air streams might be successfully met by
completely enclosing the pans and stirrups by means of shells having a very high
conductivity for heat. Theoretically, the following very distinct advantages are
gained by the use of such shells, more particularly if the exterior surfaces are polished
and the interior coated with carbon :â€”

(1) The effective volume of the disturbed air is very greatly reduced ;

(2) A shell having a high conductivity for heat may, when placed within a balance
case, be regarded as possessing throughout a strictly uniform temperature ;
in consequence of this, combined with the fact that the inner or carbon skin
has the power of rapidly absorbing and radiating heat energy, the contained
