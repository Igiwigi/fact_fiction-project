It is highly satisfactory to note that this is exactly the value found in the
series of twelve experiments made with the purest gases, and the advan
prolonged experience in the manipulation of these difficult and tedious experim: Although the last of the experiments was performed in April of last year, I
refrained from publishing the results till I could feel certain that I was unable
detect any further source of error, and until I felt assured that all the p:
sources of error which have been suggested to me by various friends who have
an active interest in my work, had been successfully overcome or did not apply to
methods of manipulation and measurement. ; With regard to the results published by Moruey, I think I may fairly claim
the simplicity of my apparatus for measuring and preparing my gases, the fact
they were never transferred from one mercury trough to another, that they 1
always saturated with water in the same way, and that the water formed by

union was never admitted to my measuring vessel, amongst other advantages, render
‘my results more worthy of confidence than his. The means adopted by him for
- detecting any impurity are unable to detect such small amounts of foreign gas as
_ were not only easily detected but measured by my method.
