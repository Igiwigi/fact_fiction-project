But
2 this able chemist, to whom we are indebted for the discovery of
S the gaseous oxide of carbone, procured his oxygenized muriatic
Z acid by a peculiar method, which 1.shall notice, in speaking of
i= the action of acids upon hyperoxygenized muriate of potash. E The substance he obtained was, in fact, not oxygenized muriatic
E acid gas, but a mixture of that'gas with hyperoxygenized mu-
5 riatic acid. I have not the smallest doubt of the accuracy of his
5 statement; but, being the proportion of a mixture, it in no way
A contradicts either of those I have determined in this Paper. Before I dismiss this part of the subject, I wish to anticipate
an objection, founded upon an observation of Mr. BerTroLLET,
which may be made to the above experiments.
