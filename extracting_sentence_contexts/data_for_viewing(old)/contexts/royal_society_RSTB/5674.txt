become very prominent.

A completely metamorphosed individual is shown from two aspects in fig. 3, D
and E. It will be seen that there is but a single atrial siphon, that the otolith is embedded
near the permanent ganglion, the phagocytised tail forms a mass of highly refractive
cells at the side of the stomach, the primary renal vesicle is well developed, and the
ectodermal ampulle form a cluster on either side of the body. This is a stage reached
in about ten days from hatching, at 12° C.

Of the remaining drawings, fig. 3, A, represents a type encountered fairly commonly
at St. Andrews. Fixation has occurred and metamorphosis proceeded to much the
same extent as in the case D and E, but phagocytosis of the tail has not commenced.
The tail, in fact, still exhibits twitching movements, though its tip shows signs of
degeneration. he reader is referred to a similar condition produced by hyper-alkalinity
in larvee of the Ascidiidae, described in Part I (BERRILL, 1929). Its significance in this
instance will be discussed later when the development of the remaining species of
Molgula has been described. It should be noted, however, that despite the absence of
tail absorption the continued growth of the trunk region and its characteristic rotation
are apparently normal.

Figs. 3, B and ©, are of two stages of development of Molgula echinosiphonica and
M. nana. That is, the tadpole usually fails to hatch as such and the tailed phase of
development is passed through entirely within the egg-membrane, and the larva finally
emerges through the continued swelling of the larval test and outgrowth of ectodermal
ampulli, thereby rupturing the membrane. It will be seen that the tadpoles them-
