which is interpreted as a form of energy conservation throughout the closure of the fluid domain
2. The constant Q is the hydraulic head, and the reader is referred to [8,15,33] for further
discussion of its physical significance.

(ii) The velocity potential

Irrotationality of the flow ensures the velocity field u may be written in terms of a velocity
potential y, according to

Gx=uU-—c, g=w (3.13)
and again the fact that the flow is both irrotational and incompressible also ensures the velocity
potential is harmonic in the interior of the fluid domain. Integrating, we find that the velocity
potential may be written according to

p(x, Z) =|. (u(L,z) — c) dl + I. w(x, s) ds, (3.14)

Xo zo
where the integration constant is chosen such that $(0,z) = 0. The 4A—periodicity of the vector field
also ensures

Q(x +A,Z) = V(x, Z) — cA. (3.15)
