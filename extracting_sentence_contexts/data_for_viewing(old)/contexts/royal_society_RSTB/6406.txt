cell is about 760 » from the posterior pole. The division rate, which was rather
slow until the 7 hour stage, has now rapidly increased.

At the 10} hour stage (fig. 4a, b) about 41-45 cells could be counted, the deepest
cell being about 1066 » from the posterior pole of the egg. The cells have now
started to migrate towards the egg-periphery. The disposition of the division
spindles in these early stages do not show any definite orientation to the egg-periphery,
a fact which is in accord with what has been described in the majority of insects so
far studied.

All the cleavage cells are stellate but none of them shows comet-like protoplasmic
extensions streaming behind the migrating cells (cf. EAstHam, 1927 ; Seut, 1931 ;
and others). In the present case, therefore, the migration of the cleavage cells to the
egg-periphery should be described not as a nuclear movement with the dragging of
the cytoplasm behind the nucleus, but as a movement of the entire cell. In other
words, the impetus of migration is shared equally by the nucleus and the cytoplasm.
The cause of the migration has been ascribed by several workers to amoeboid move-
ment. In the locust eggs, however, there is no evidence of such a movement, and
PatTen’s (1884) idea, also accepted by EasrHam (1927), of some centrifugal influence
propelling the cells towards the periphery seems more acceptable.
