planar MEAs [8] with one or no vertical protrusions. An alternative solution aims to improve
sealing by reverting the protrusions into a hollow in the microelectrode [39].

In all these cases, the optimal protrusion/hollow morphology is still unknown and the ability
to predict the electrode impedance ahead of fabrication would support performance optimization.
Furthermore, the integration of protrusions with an amplification unit per sense/stimulation
site results in extracellular sensing platforms with unprecedented recording quality, as both the
coupling and the sealing are maximized. A notable example is the active three-dimensional-
shaped CMOS nanoelectrode array (CNEA) platform in [39,42] (#6 in table 1).

Extracellular sensors are nevertheless inherently limited by a low signal, introduce distortions
of the recorded AP waveform and do not carry the whole spectrum of information as their
intracellular counterparts (figure 1c). In fact, the extracellular recorded signal also depends on
the neuron-electrode adherence and on the aggregation of ion channels at the interface [17,18]. To
overcome these limitations, significant work has been devoted to intracellular sensors, also based
on semiconductor device fabrication processes, as discussed in the following section.

(b) Overview of intracellular recording devices

The sensor size and geometry are crucial to attain stable access to the intracellular medium;
both should be optimized for the purpose. Sharp protruding vertical nanowires/nanoneedles
with diameter of <100nm can promote spontaneous cell penetration as the result of cell-
sensor adhesion-mediated forces and active cellular processes such as endocytosis [43], see for
instance the high aspect-ratio vertical nanoneedlesâ€™ array in [44] (#4 in table 1). However, such a
miniaturized sensor suffers from small coupling capacitance essentially because of the reduced
