phore bears two sporangia is in itself a striking point of resemblance to Sphenophyllum
Jertile; in the detailed structure of the fertile lamina and the mode of attachment of
the sporangia there is also a fairly close agreement. Count Sonms-Lavusacn finds
that in his species the pendulous sporangia were inserted far to the outside on the
lower edge of the expanded summit of the sporangiophore.{ He compares their
position with that of the ovules in Zamia or Encephalartos.\| This description holds
good equally for Sphenophyllum fertile, and the course of the bundles supplying the
sporangia seems also to have been identical in the two cases. The pedicel in
B. Rimeri is described as having enlarged epidermal cells limited to its outer side,
just as in our fossil,** while the large-celled external epidermis of the lamina (Schuppe)
is similar to, though more strongly developed than in the lateral enlargements of the
wall which occur near the base of the sporangium,tt a description which might have
been taken from Sphenophyllum fertile. The fact that the bracts of B. Rémeri are free
nearly to their base} is also a point of resemblance to the appendages of our strobilus.

On the other hand there are important differences between S. fertile and the
Cracow fossil. In the latter, the sporangiophores are described as free from each

* It appears clear, however, that when this is carried out, at least four genera will have to be
established, represented by the types Sphenophyllum Dawsoni, 8. majus, Bowmanttes Rimeri, and the strobilus
now under consideration.
