»henotype change does occur there is no guarantee that its magnitude
reveals the full quantitative contribution of that particular gene since
he magnitude of the effect may also be buffered. This is a problem

have recently referred to as the ‘genetic differential effect problem’
(Noble 2008c) and it has of course been known for many years. There is
nothing new about the existence of the problem. What is new is that gene
knockouts have revealed how extensive the problem is. Moreover, there is
a possible solution to the problem to which I will return later.

(viii) The existence of stochastic gene expression allows some form of selection
operating at the level of tissues and organs (Laforge et al. 2004; Kaern et al.
2005; Kupiec 2008, 2009). In fact, such selection may be a prerequisite of
successful living systems which can use only those variations that are fit
for purpose. As Kupiec has noted, Darwinian selection could also be very
effective within the individual organism, as well as between organisms.

(ix) Not only is gene expression stochastic, the products of gene expression,
the proteins, each have many interactions (at least dozens) with other
elements in the organism. Proteins are not as highly specific as was once
anticipated. Bray (Bray & Lay 1994; Bray 2009) has highlighted the role of
multiple interactions in comparing the evolution of protein networks with
that of neural networks.
