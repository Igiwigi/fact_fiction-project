We shall in fact show in a subsequent paper that there is within these limits a
remarkable quantitative correspondence between increased pressure of CO, and
increased assimilation. The restriction in the absorption of the gas by the leaf must rather be sought in
the difficulty which the gaseous carbon dioxide experiences in passing from the

intercellular spaces through the cell-walls of the assimilating parenchyma, ‘The
penetration of these cell-membranes must necessarily be preceded by the solution of
the gas, and any phenomena of diffusion which take place between this point and
the assimilating centres must be referred to liquid and not to gaseous diffusion. GrauHaM, in his Bakerian Lecture of 1850 (‘Chemical and Physical Researches,’
p. 446), showed that the “liquid diffusion of carbonic acid is a slow process compared
with its gaseous diffusion, quite as much as days are to minutes.” We have in this
fact something more than a suggestion of where we may expect to find the point of
greatest resistance in the path of the carbon dioxide on its way from the outer air to
the chlorophyll corpuscles, and where at any rate one important “ throttle-valve ” of
the assimilatory process is situated.
