During his period at Cambridge and then UCL, Michael published a series of papers on
general theory of elastic stability [3-22] and developed—largely independently of another giant of
modern mechanics, Warner Tjardus Koiter (1914-1997)—the theory of imperfection sensitivity of
structures. Michael had been unaware of Koiter’s PhD thesis [23], published in Dutch in 1945. In
his ‘Advice to a young researcher’ [24], he reminisces: ‘it was, in fact, when I submitted my paper
on the basic principles of elastic stability [7] in 1963 to Rodney Hill at Nottingham that he drew
my attention, for the first time, to the work of Koiter...’. These researches, both in solo papers
and in collaboration with associates, culminated in a monograph [25] together with his former
student Giles Hunt, who later became a long-term collaborator. In its preface Michael wrote
