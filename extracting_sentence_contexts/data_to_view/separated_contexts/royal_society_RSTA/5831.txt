We return to this after discussing the splitting
case. In almost all respects the splitting analysis is the same as that of the decay case. The only
important differences comes from the fact that the score function ¢ for splitting (3.2) is not the
turbulence fraction F;. However, ¢ and F; are closely related, both in terms of expression (3.2)
and in terms of the values they take during band splitting in figure 6b. A split is deemed to have
occurred when ¢(u(f)) reaches hg, from below.
