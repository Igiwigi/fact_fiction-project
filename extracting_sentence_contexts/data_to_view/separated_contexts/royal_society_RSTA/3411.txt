In the context of the
VLT-Flames Tarantula Survey [60], we have analysed an unprecedentedly large sample (of 62)
of the most massive Of-Of/WN-WNh stars in the 30 Doradus region of the Large Magellanic
Cloud using CMFGEN. The results are presented in figure 5 and in Bestenlehner et al. [61]. The
most notable aspect of our empirical work is that we do indeed confirm the presence of a kink at a

2Note that although there could be other reasons for low mass-loss rates, such as magnetic models [50], the fact that there
appears to be a maximum Milky Way black hole mass of order around 10Mg indicates a Z-dependence is strongly favoured.
