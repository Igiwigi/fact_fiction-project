outcomes are possible [6,83,84]. modal terms in children’s speech might be reflecting a ‘mini-

mal’ understanding of possibility, while the adult-like
comprehension of modal verbs might await the development

. of ‘modal’ concepts of possibility [75].
4. Interactions of language and thought A second aspect of the reviewed evidence suggesting that
Is the current evidence compatible with theories of acqui- language could contribute to conceptual change has to do with
sition suggesting that language might be providing input to the fact that, across languages, logical and modal terms tend to


be polysemous and children seem to learn ‘easier’ (i.e. non-
logical, non-epistemic) meanings first. Given that logical and
possibility concepts are hard to learn from observation alone,
polysemy might be providing the workspace for developing
such concepts, through extension of the ‘easy’ meanings (as
some sort of ‘conceptual bootstrapping’ [88]). Negation is a
case in point, as words such as no and not have multiple mean-
ings, each of which seems to be acquired at different time
points. As we saw earlier, children first acquire the meanings
of rejection and non-existence, which can plausibly be acquired
