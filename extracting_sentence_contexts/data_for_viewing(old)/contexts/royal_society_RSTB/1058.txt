stated that the appearance indicated the position of the blastopore, while both the
latter would apparently regard it simply as the nucleus of the larger cell. That it
does not mark the position of the blastopore is evident from the fact that it doesnot
coincide with the point of closure of the blastoderm in any of the forms I have
studied ; moreover, similar cells are seen to arise in quite different positions at later
stages, sometimes two or more at a time. That it is not a mere nucleus is easily
seen by examination. Korscuerr and Herper, in their excellent â€˜ Lehrbuch der
vergleichenden Entwicklungsgeschichte, truly remark that, judging from Nasonov's
figures, new cellular elements are formed from the yolk.

I did not succeed in ascertaining what determined the side of the ovum on which
the second blastomere appeared, but that it was neither light nor gravity is evident,
firstly, from the fact that light is practically cut off from the ova in many cases ;
and secondly, that the ova in ovigerous lamelle of Chthamalus, which were
sufficiently transparent to examine without disturbing their relative position, showed
that the position of the cell was apparently quite capricious.

It may be noted that when the first epiblastic cell was separated from the yolk by
a plane inclined towards one side, the second appeared very generally on the opposite
side (figs. 10, 12; of also figs. 48, 87). This would seem to point to the conclusion |
already drawn by Nasonoy, on observing the inclination of the plane, that the
bilateral symmetry of the adult is determined at this early period. I failed, however,
to confirm his statement that the polar bodies are always a little to one side.
