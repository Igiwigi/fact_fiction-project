it as a physicist’s of his telescope: the times of morbid are just as easily distinguished by
me from those of healthy vision, as by men of ordinary faculty, dream from waking; nor is
there a single fact stated in the following pages which I have not verified with a chemist’s
analysis, and a geometer’s precision. Although he describes his cloud variously as ‘Manchester devil’s darkness’, ‘a nasty solution in
