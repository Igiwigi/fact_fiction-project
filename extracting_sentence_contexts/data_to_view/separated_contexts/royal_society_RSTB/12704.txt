HVC shelf and the

[98,99]. This distributed template concept might be an interest-
ing hypothesis to investigate in social Hymenoptera that
Esponda & Gordon [100] began to tackle by studying it at the
colony level: nest-mate recognition by the colony is achieved
through a distributed process, so that overall, ants from one
colony distinguish those from another, but individuals do not
always do so.

6. Conclusion

Although we only addressed in detail the case of olfactory
and auditory processing in social Hymenoptera and birds,
respectively, it is important to note that recognition is, in
fact, multimodal and that animals might prioritize one
modality over others at different times of the decision-
making process to achieve a better balance between speed
and accuracy (e.g. in wasps [27]). Similarly to the use of various sensory modalities, both taxa
could also use various types of recognition learning (i.e. direct
and indirect). Indirect recognition involves recognizing indi-
viduals not by their phenotype but by their environment
(e.g. spatial and social cues).
