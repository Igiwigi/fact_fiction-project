spheric thicknesses. Now, as the ray is known which, if observed, would give the
same alteration in luminosity as that of the whole spectrum, it follows that with these
data the equivalent ray for the photographic light can be deduced as shown in § XXV.

Fig. 4.

To ensure accuracy several sets of double cells, C, C,, were prepared, as shown in the
figure (fig. 4). The top cell, C,, contained turbid water, the turbidity being caused by
suspended mastic. The mastic was very cautiously precipitated and was thus held in
suspension, As a matter of fact turbid water of different turbidities was prepared
nearly two years before it was employed; and thus any coarse particles had ample
time to settle ; for the vessels containing it were kept undisturbed during that period
and the liquid was syphoned off as required. The bottom cell, C,, contained pure
water. Behind the cell the exposing box (fig. 1), already described, was placed, and
in front of C, sectors which rotated by means of clock work. The sectors could be
clamped at any desired aperture. The apparatus, as shown, was then placed on a
stand at such an angle that the sun’s rays fell directly on the platinum paper inside
the box B, when the exposing apertures were open. The sectors were closed to
the extent which it was judged should suffice to make the blackness of the two
exposed squares of platinum paper approximately the same, though it will be seen by
the experiments to be subsequently described that this was not always attained.
Exposures for different lengths of time were given in each experiment, and conse-
