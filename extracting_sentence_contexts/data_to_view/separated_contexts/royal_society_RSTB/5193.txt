BURNE ON “FINE” VESSELS ASSOCIATED WITH

also vessels of a similar nature, associated (so far as that particular observation went)
with the ventral branch of the hypobranchial arteries, and it seemed likely that the
system was of general occurrence in Teleosteans. In the present paper, I have pursued
the subject further, and have made a detailed study of the distribution of these
vessels in the Cod. My object in doing so was, in the first place, to confirm the facts
recorded in Lophius in some less specialised Teleostean ; to determine more surely the
relations of the system to the blood vessels and lymphatics ; to ascertain its morphological
status ; and to find evidence of the mode of entry of blood into the vessels, the direction
of flow within them, and any structural indications there might be of their physiological
meaning.

2. Material and Methods. The Cod (Gadus morrhua) was chosen partly because of its convenient size and shape,
and partly because it differs widely in habits and relationship from the species previously
investigated.
