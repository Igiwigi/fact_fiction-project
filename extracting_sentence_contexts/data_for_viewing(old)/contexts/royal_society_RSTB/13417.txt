it is likely that mothers can influence the epigenetic state of
a fetus via factors transferred across the placenta. Thus,
because of the auto-propagation of epigenetic states, it is
not unreasonable to suggest that mammalian mothers could
influence the development of their offspring and even the
developing eggs within female fetuses. If so, and there is
some evidence, this could potentially influence the epigenetic
state of grand-offspring [23,46].

Mammalian fathers are different. In males, spermatogen-
esis is an ongoing process throughout life. Therefore, fathers
have the possibility of affecting gene expression in offspring
in ways that benefit offspring. The fact that mammalian
semen is packed with small RNA molecules provides a
highly plausible mechanism by which they might achieve
this [24,47,48].

The importance of small RNA molecules in epigenetic
inheritance is perhaps best characterized in Caenorhabditis ele-
gans. Examples of transgenerational inheritance include
responses to pathogens such as Pseudomonas [49] and poss-
ibly viruses [50,51] that are propagated over generations.
These mechanisms and the overwhelming evidence for

intergenerational epigenetic inheritance in C. elegans are
