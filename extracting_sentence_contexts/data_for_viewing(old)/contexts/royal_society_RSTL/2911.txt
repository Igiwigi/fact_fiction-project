406 MR, R. RIGG ON THE EVOLUTION OF NITROGEN

tuting an atmosphere with a decided preponderance of nitrogen and a much smaller
proportion of oxygen.

Finding that plants under different circumstances of growth differ in the relative
quantity of nitrogen which they contain, as well as in the other elements which enter
into their constitution, I was desirous of obtaining information which would lead us
to account for the well-known fact of plants increasing most in size during cloudy
weather, and of grasses, for instance, which are shaded (as under hedges), increasing
much in straw, but producing seed both small in quantity and inferior in quality.

By way of commencement in this part of the research, I made duplicate experi-
ments with the same kind of seeds, steeped them in and supplied them with the same
kind of water, and kept them under equal circumstances in every respect, except that
of placing one of each in the sun's rays in the greenhouse, where the sun shone till
three y.v., and the other in the same situation, excluded howeyer from the sun's rays,
but not from the light. Those in the shade increased in length much more than the
others, were a little lighter in colour, and when weighed before they were exposed to
the drying temperature, were also heavier, but when dried at 100* to 110? were con-
siderably less in weight. The ultimate analyses of these experiments are found in
