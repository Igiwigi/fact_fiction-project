in the ordinary sense, the relationship between the phenomena in wood, on the one
hand, and in the metals and crystals on the other, will be discussed below.

By careful illumination it is possible to observe the slip-lines deseribed above, in
unstained sections merely mounted in water. A more vivid demonstration of them,
however, is obtained by staining compressed specimens with aniline chloride followed
by aniline blue. These stains afford a means of demonstrating the lines even in the
most initial stages of failure, before any buckling or crinkling has taken place, and
before a zone of failure has developed. The lines and the wall-substance in their

_ immediate vicinity hold the blue stain, whilst the rest of the wall remains yellow.
Corresponding results are obtained with cotton red and aniline blue, and with chlor.-
zinc-iodide solution. It has in fact been established that the remarkable differential
staining of the zone of failure described above (pp. 54 and 55) is almost entirely due
to the multiplicity of slip-planes in the substance of the cell-walls. The substance of
