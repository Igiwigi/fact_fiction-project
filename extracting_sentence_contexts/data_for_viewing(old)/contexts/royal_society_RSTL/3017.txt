IN one of my communications to the Cornwall Geological Society on the
high temperature of the interior of the earth, I ventured to express a belief that
mineral veins, and the internal heat, are connected with electrical action, This
opinion, founded as it was on the curious arrangement of the veins, &c. in pri-
mitiye rocks, I have had the satisfaction to find confirmed by experiments
made in some of the mines of Cornwall; and, I doubt not that the existence of
electricity in metalliferous veins similarly circumstanced, and capable of con-
ducting it, will prove to be as uniyersal a fact, as the progressive increase of
temperature under the earth's surface is now admitted to be, much as my
conclusions on this point were at one time controverted.

In my first experiment I did not succeed in detecting any electricity; but in
my second I had the gratification to obserye considerable electrical action,

My apparatus consisted of small plates of sheet copper, which were fixed in
contact with ore in the veins by copper nails, or pressed closely against it
by wooden props, stretched across the © leyels” or galleries. Between two of
these plates at different stations, and a galvanometer*, a communication was
made þy means of copper wire one-twentieth of an inch in diameter, which was
at first coated with sealing-wax ; but afterwards this precaution was dispensed
