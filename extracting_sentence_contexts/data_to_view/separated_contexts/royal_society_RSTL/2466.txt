340 REV. JAMES FARQUHARSON ON THE ICE

slowly than it had risen ; and the experiment was repeatedly renewed with similar
results, leaving no doubt that the heat, like the light, radiated throngh, and was re-
fracted by the water. If the fact is 80 in regard to the radiation of heat through a
mass of water four or five inches thick, where ought we to set the limits of thickness
of the mass through which it cannot pass? Obviously only where the thickness is 80
great, that the aggregation of the fluid, and of its minute impurities, prevents the
transmission of light, as in the deeps of the sea, but not within the ordinary depths
of our clear streams,

Of the effect of radiation in cooling down the surface of the ground, and substances
placed upon it, during a clear sky, we cannot give a more Jucid account than that of
M. Araco, in his paper © On the supposed Influence of the Moon on Vegetation.”
* No one had supposed,” says he, © before Dr. Wes, that terrestrial substances, ex-
cepting in the case of a very rapid evaporation, may acquire during the night a dif-
ferent temperature from that of the surrounding air.
