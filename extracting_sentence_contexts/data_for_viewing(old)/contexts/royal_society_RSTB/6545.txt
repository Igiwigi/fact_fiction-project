Jouannsen (1929), although finding that in the Lepidopteron Diacrisia virginica
Fieb. the mid-gut arises from cell-masses proliferating from the blind ends of the
stomodaeum and the proctodaeum, interprets these proliferations as endodermal.
He thus reverts to the idea of a “latent endoderm” suggested long ago by HEwER
(1897). RicHarps (1932) concurs, in the main, with JoHANNsEN but, further,
brings in the idea of “ prospective significances’. By this he means that “ what-
ever cells in each particular case happen to be appropriately located at the time
when the endodermal strands are due to be formed, those cells will be “‘ deter-
mined ”’ to form the mid-gut anlage, and subsequently differentiate into the structure
typical of mid-gut epithelium”. Needless to say, these views, as well as those of
Nussaum and Futinsxi (1906) and Easruam (1930, a), start with the assunfption
that the mid-gut epithelium cannot be anything but endodermal. Such an assump-
tion is both misleading and not supported by facts.

From this mass of diverse evidence, the following conclusions emerge :

1. That the insect endoderm consists of primary and secondary portions which
are made up as follows :

(a) Primary endoderm. Consists of the primary yolk cells (best seen in the
Strepsiptera where they form a “ primary mid-gut’’), and the yolk cell
membrane (found in Locusta and Carausius).

(b) Secondary endoderm. Consists of secondary yolk cells, and “ cells ’? formed by
secondary yolk cleavage. It may also consist (as, for instance, in Carausius)
