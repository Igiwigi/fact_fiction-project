A brief notice of them. was
published in the Quarterly Journal for Julyâ€”October, 1816, and a more extended paper was read
at the Royal Society of Edinburgh on the 4th of January 1819, The difficulties of the subject, however,
prevented me from pursuing it but at distant intervals; and the more fertile topic of polarisation
afterwards required all the time I could devote to such inquiries,

188 DR. BREWSTER ON REFLECTED LIGHT.

with one another,) the intensity of reflection at their common surface is always
less the nearer the refractive indices of the media approach to equality ; and
when they are exactly equal, reflection ceases altogether, and the ray pursues
its course in the second medium, unchanged either in direction, yelocity, or
intensity. It is evident from this fact, which is general, that the reflective or
refractive forces, in all media of equal refractive densities follow exactly the
same laws, and are similarly related to one another ; and that in media un-
equally refractive, the relation between the reflecting and refracting forces is
not arbitrary, but that the one is dependent on the other, and increases and
diminishes with it. This remarkable cireumstance renders the supposition
of the identity of form of the function expressing the law of action of the mole-
cules of all bodies on light indifferently, less improbable.

*'To show experimentally the phenomena in question, take a glass prism or
thin wedge of a very small refracting angle (balf a degree-for instance : almost
any fragment of plate glass indeed will do, as it is seldom the two sides are
parallel), and placing it conveniently with the eye close to it, yiew the image
of a candle reflected from the exterior of the face next the eye. This will be
seen accompanied at a little distance by another image reflected internally
from the other face, and the two images will be nearly of equal brightness, if
the incidence be not very great.
