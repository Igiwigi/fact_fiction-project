When the user walks away, the signal strength decreases. On the other hand,
the spatial distribution of channel gain seen by photodetector D7 is almost flat (i.e. the same
channel gain for all cells). This is a result of the fact that this detector is oriented towards the floor
and the detector only captures reflected rays, i.e. there is not LOS component. Table 9 presents the average channel gains and RMS delay spreads (i.e. averaged over 100 cells
in the room) for D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, DÃ© and D7. It is observed from table 9 that the best location of
photodetector (i.e. minimum path loss) is D5.
