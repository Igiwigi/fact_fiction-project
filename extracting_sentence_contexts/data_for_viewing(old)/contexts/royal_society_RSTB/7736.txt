Of these, formations (d) to (f) formed an Older Drift, since they appeared to cap the
higher land and to have been left as outliers by the downcutting of the Avon river system
with its successive terraces forming Newer Drift. It was in 1946 that I decided to extend
the mapping of the Warwickshire Pleistocene eastward, and though in the 17 years which
had elapsed since my 1929 paper I had not changed the broad features of the succession
beyond suspecting that (b) was merely an outlier of (e), I had become painfully aware of
the inaccuracy of many of my mapped boundaries. This inaccuracy largely resulted from
my inexperience in recognizing the extent of solifluxion on the slopes. This can result in
gravels being mapped at levels much below that of their true occurrence; more seriously
gravel material creeping downhill over outcrops of Keuper marl or Upper Carboniferous
clays can produce in shallow exposures what appears to be pebbly clay, and since the glacial
clays are also red and are in fact very largely reconstituted Keuper marl, such exposures
may be interpreted as boulder clay. Much of the boulder clay marked either as ‘unspecified
in age’ or ‘older clay’ in my 1929 paper results from this error.

There is also in the east Warwickshire succession another possible source of error working
in the opposite way from the one described above. Much of the clay of the Older Drift is
not boulder clay—it can be quite stoneless and so closely resembling Keuper marl that
I have sometimes stopped auger holes in the belief that the Pleistocene had been bottomed,
only to have occasion later to deepen the holes and to run into sand, gravel or boulder
clay beneath the believed Keuper marl. This similarity between solid formation and stone-
less clay drift could clearly lead to further mapping inaccuracies. I therefore decided that
before a reliable map could be produced, it was necessary to establish the details of a firm
succession by boring along selected traverses.
