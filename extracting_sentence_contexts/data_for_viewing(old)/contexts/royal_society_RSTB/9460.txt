tradition of civilian jurisprudence. Each tradition has by the vagaries of history
influenced most of the legal systems of the world.

It is now accepted that the work of comparative lawyers, whose discipline
was based on finding differences, and the globalization of many legal concepts,
particularly the rule of law as applicable to all governmental action and the
right to a fair and open trial, have brought about a considerable narrowing of
the differences. We have come a long way over the past generation in our
approach to the differences between our systems.

Differences do remain, but they operate by and large as differing ways of bring-
ing about (i) checks and balances in the investigative process and (ii) differing
ways of fact finding. An example of the first is the duty of disclosure in a criminal
investigation. All our systems recognize that it is an essential attribute of a fair trial
that the prosecutor discloses to the defence any material that he has which might
help the defence or show weaknesses in the prosecution case. In this jurisdiction,
this basic duty has developed into a very far reaching obligation on the part of the
prosecutor and on the part of experts deployed by the prosecution. We interpret
the obligation as extending to all relevant material and have quite a wide concept
of relevance. In our sister common law jurisdiction, the United States, exactly the
same procedure operates more narrowly as there is a much narrower view of
what is meant by relevance. In the continent of Europe, although this is a
common obligation governed by the jurisprudence of the European Court of
Human Rights at Strasbourg, the operation of disclosure in practice is generally
governed by what is contained in the dossier and that is often very much narrower
