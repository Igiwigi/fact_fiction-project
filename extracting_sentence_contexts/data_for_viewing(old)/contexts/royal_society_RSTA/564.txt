presented in §2, together with the use of this framework to compare surface albedo and SW
cloud feedbacks using the so-called ‘climate sensitivity’ approach for the LGM. Section 3 first
compares the radiative feedbacks averaged over the NH for the LGM and MH climates and then
highlights model differences in West Africa. The relationship between the vegetation feedback
and model physics or biases in the model’s modern climatology is discussed in §5 before a rapid
discussion (§6).

2. Forcing and feedbacks at the global scale for the LGM

(a) The simplified framework

We use the Taylor et al. [37] simplified approach to quantify the forcing and feedbacks in the SW
domain. It uses the fact that the variation of the planetary albedo (@) can be decomposed so as to
reflect the individual contributions from the surface albedo (ag), the bulk atmospheric absorption
(1) and the atmospheric scattering (y):

where e represents the nonlinear contribution of the different parameters and is negligible here,
and A represents the difference between two climatic periods. The first two terms of the right-
hand side of this equation are the ones we focus on. Changes in atmospheric absorption are small
for the MH. They are thus not considered in the comparison below even though we diagnosed it.
Indeed our objective is to compare model behaviours for the MH and the LGM, which justifies
