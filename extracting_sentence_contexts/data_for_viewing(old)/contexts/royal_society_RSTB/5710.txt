have either upset the rhythm of the interstitial cells but not that of the germ cells
(under natural conditions the development of the interstitial tissue being associated
with a rising temperature), or that this rapid rise of temperature has a specific action
in inhibiting the development of the interstitial tissue.

A continued high temperature is not essential to the development of the secondary
sexual characters. In Experiment IV the fish were exposed to the higher temperature
(18° C.) for seven days, and then the temperature was reduced to that of their natural
habitat at the beginning of the experiment (11° C.). The secondary sexual characters
developed at the same rate as the control (Experiment III) in which the higher tem-
perature was maintained. The development of the secondary sexual characters therefore
does not depend on the environment of the fish being above a certain threshold tem-
perature. Further evidence of this fact is given by the development of the sexual
characters at a temperature of 8° C. in Experiment XVI. The fish are at this tem-
perature both in their natural habitat in April and in Experiment V, without the
secondary sexual characters. It is clear that a rise of temperature is one of the
conditions essential to the development of the secondary sexual characters.

B.—The Duration of the Fully Developed Sexual Characters.

In Experiment | the breeding season of the fish was extended one month in comparison
with the natural breeding season. Actually the extension of the breeding season in
the experiment was probably greater than one month. The loss of the secondary
sexual characters of the fish in their natural habitat is gradual, and the highest develop-
ment of the sexual characters is passed by the beginning of August.
