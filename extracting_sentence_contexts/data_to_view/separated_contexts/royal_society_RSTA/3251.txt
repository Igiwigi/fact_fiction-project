The values for 7 less than 8 are not required, and when 7 = 8 these formulz are
found to agree mutatis mutandis with those of the last section. It is pretty clear from general considerations that the higher inequalities
corresponding to harmonics other than the zonal ones must be very small. I
have, in fact, computed the third tesseral harmonic inequality (¢ = 3, s = 2), and
find that it is so very minute compared with the third zonal inequality (¢ = 3, s = 0)
as to be negligible.. Accordingly it appeared to be a waste of time to develop
formulz for any other than zonal inequalities for values of 7 greater than 8. Thus
of the formule: just determined the only one of which actual use is made is (63).
