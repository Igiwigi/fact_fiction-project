with the standard ‘difference’ notation and where xH is given at uniform intervals of ¢,
As the period decreases «H changes so rapidly that numerical differentiation is inadequate,
but this is just the condition under which the approximations (14-10) and (14-12) hold,
Differentiation of these gives useful expressions for de/d(«H) as kxH—>o.
In the second and higher modes we have
