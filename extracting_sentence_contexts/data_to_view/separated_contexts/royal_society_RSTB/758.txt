216, accurately reconstructed from
sagittal sections, it is seen to be strongly curved, so that while the coraco-scapular
angle, as usually taken, 7.c., considering the ventral end of the scapula only, is about
135°, it is only about 83° if the general direction of the scapula is taken by a line
joining its base and apex. Fig. 216 certainly suggests the straightening of the
shoulder-girdle by its release from the backward pull of the shoulder muscles. Another striking fact is that the long axis of the coracoid (fig. 216, Cor.) is
inclined from its sternal articulation forwards, so as to make an acute angle with the
vertebral column, instead of a right angle as in later stages (cf fig. 204, Cor.).
