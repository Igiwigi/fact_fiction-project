touching a hair a normal variation was obseryed, consisting of a positive deflection
followed by a prolonged negative after effect, that is, the same phenomena as were
described in 1873. On cutting off the leaf with as long a petiole as possible, no effect
could be observed on the difference. Half the petiole having been removed without
effect, the difference being now —0'0112, half the remainder was removed, the result
of which was that the difference increased (the observation being made as s00n as
compensation could be effected, that is, within a minute after the amputation) to
—0:0198. In the course of a few minutes the difference sank to —0'01, that is, a
little below its original amount. Amputating half of the remainder of the petiole still
attached raised ib at once to — 0023, but it s0on sank to —0:017. Clipping off the
stump of the petiole which still remained, produced only a slight increase to — 002,
Throughout these experiments the excitatory variation exhibited the same character,
We have thus before us two sets of facts relating to the electrical influence of the petiole
on the leaf, viz. : (1) that a current through the petiole, if directed towards the leaf,
renders the attached and proximal end negative to the distal, and (2) that removal
of the petiole produces the same effect. I am unable at present to explain either of
these phenomena. The nature of the electrical relation between the two organs which
underlies both must remain undetermined until it is possible to make further
experiments.

observation of the electrical effects which present themselves when the leaf is led off
