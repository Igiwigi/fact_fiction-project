Hardy & Ramanujan [3] stunned the mathematical community with their proof of their
asymptotic formula. Theorem 1.1 (Hardy-Ramanujan, 1918). As 1 — +00, we have

ae et Vm
4nV3 ‘

In fact, Hardy and Ramanujan proved a much stronger result than this asymptotic. They
showed that p(7) can be approximated by means of a divergent series, sharpening the asymptotic
in theorem 1.1. Specifically, they showed that there is a sum of similar terms such that for some
constant C,

p(n) ~

Cn
p(n) = Y> Ej(n) +O @)., (1.2)
j=l

Here, E,(n) ~ (1/(4nV3)) -e7¥2"/5 is the main term, and the later terms have similar
asymptotics but for exponentials with smaller multiples of ./n.
