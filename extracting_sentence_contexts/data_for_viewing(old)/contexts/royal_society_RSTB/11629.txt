common argument in the social insect literature is that the
high density of social insects inside their nests puts them at
risk of rapidly transmitting infectious diseases within the
nest. However, such disease spread is seldom seen, leading
to the development of many hypotheses about how social
insects achieve ‘social immunity’ [172,173] or ‘organizational
immunity’ [174], including through structuring their nests to
regulate interaction rates [174]. For example, small nest
entrances protected by guard workers may prevent pathogens
from entering the nest [175]. Finally, wildlife managers may
take action to prevent the spread of disease, for example
through vaccination. However, such management actions
can, in fact, expedite the spread of disease by creating unna-
tural spatial clustering of animals. For example, the use of
feeding stations to distribute vaccinations for disease preven-
tion spatially clusters animals and increases the risks of
disease transmission [176].

cutter ant species that live in wet environments will dig
special waste chambers inside their nest, while leaf cutter
ant species from arid environments will dispose of their
waste outside the nest [150]. One potential explanation for
this difference is that in wet environments, microorganisms
in the waste are more likely to spread and so confining
waste in chambers that can be closed off reduces the risk of
