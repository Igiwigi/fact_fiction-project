The gauge reading gave
4eV*, where V is the speed through the air, plus a negative pressure of $pV,*?, where V,
is the speed over the ground, the latter component being due to the action of centrifugal
force of the air in the tube transmitting the pressure from the pitot to the manometer. A previous investigation shows that, at the speeds used, the effects of compressibility
are negligible. ‘The tube was laid along the arm, and was connected to the manometer
through a double mercury seal placed at the upper end of the central shaft. As in the
spinning experiment, it was necessary to take observations of temperature and barometric
pressure in order to determine p. ‘The temperature variations in this case were of some

importance owing to seasonal effects, which were accentuated by the fact that the arm
is housed in a corrugated iron building. It was found, after a complete investigation

approximately 7 per cent. less than the speed over the ground.
