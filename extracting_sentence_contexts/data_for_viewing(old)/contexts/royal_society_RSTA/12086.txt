5687 may be employed as an index of temperature, since they are present in the
spectrum of any flame containing sodium the temperature of which is hot enough to
melt platinum, but do not appear at lower temperatures. â€˜The Bessemer flame does
not show this double line, but only the D lines; neither does it show the lithium
orange line, which appears at a somewhat lower temperature.

We cannot conclude from this that the flame is not hot enough to produce these
lines, because in such a case we have to deal, not only with the temperature, but the
quantity of material present, and the relative brilliancy and consequent visibility of
the two pairs of sodium lines.

The proportion of sodium in the Bessemer flame is ecient very small, from the
narrowness and want of intensity of the D lines, and the fact that they were not seen
reversed in any spectrum, Hence, though the temperature may be high enough, the
quantity of material present is not sufficiently large to yield the lines 5681 and 5687.

The quantitative relations of the different lines have really not been investigated in
flame-spectra, except and alone so far as they apply to total extinction of all lines,
which in the case of sodium refers to the D lines only, and this in flames no hotter
than that of a Bunsen burner. If we apply the same line of reasoning to the appear-
ance of the reversed hydrogen lines in the red and the blue, it may be stated that the
line in the red, corresponding to solar line C, never appears in any hydrogen or hydro-
carbon flame burnt with air or with oxygen. It invariably appears in sparks passed
through steam, and it also comes out as a reversed line under suitable conditions in
the Bessemer spectrum.
