6 Standing at a point which commanded a view of the Rhone glacier, both above and
Selow the cascade, we observed that the extensive ice-field above was discoloured
Sy sand and debris, distributed without regularity. At the summit of the ice-fall the
Bralley narrows to a gorge, and the slope downwards is for some distance precipitous. In descending, the ice is greatly shattered ; in fact, the glacier is broken repeatedly

at the swmmit of the declivity, transverse chasms being thus formed ; and these. as the ice descends, are broken up into confused ridges and peaks, with intervening
spaces, where the mass is ground to pieces. By this breaking up of the glacier the
dirt upon its surface undergoes fresh distribution : instead of being spread uniformly
over the lope, spaces are observed quite free from dirt, and other spaces covered with
it, but there is no appearance of regularity in this distribution.
