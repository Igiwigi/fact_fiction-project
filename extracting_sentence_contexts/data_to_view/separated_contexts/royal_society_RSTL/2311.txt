A MORE perfect apprehension of those subtile agencies, the effects of which are
continually present in various operations of nature, seems of paramount importance
to the future advancement of science. Thus the physical causes of heat, light, elec-
tricity and magnetism, have become subjects of deep interest to the natural philo-
sopher ; little apology, therefore, may perhaps be deemed requisite for my venturing
to submit to the consideration of the Royal Society an account of some inquiries, the
object of which is to improve our knowledge of one of these great natural powers. As it is only by a patient and repeated induction from well investigated facts that we
can hope to attain a higher degree of perfection in natural knowledge, I have thought
it not altogether undesirable to inquire further into the elementary laws of common
electricity : indeed, upon considering the late fine discoveries of Dr. Farapar, this
seems to a certain extent requisite. The researches of this distinguished philosopher
have inyested electrical phenomena generally with a new interest, and exposed noyel
and important features in the theory of electrical action. The investigations in this department of science, which I have now the honour of
presenting to the Royal Society, will, I hope, be found to contain matter of sufficient
interest to render them not unworthy of its acceptance.
