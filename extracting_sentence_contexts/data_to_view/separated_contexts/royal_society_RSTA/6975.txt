In the main stream J+ }U2 is constant and the adiabatic law holds; these facts can be used
to eliminate the term in dp pe from this equation and give the standard form

Finally, the same method could be applied to the energy equation on the lines of F.D.
pp. 614 and 615, to yield an energy-integral equation, but it does not seem that any useful
purpose would be served by the equation thus obtained since an approximate solution of
the energy equation is known.

4. METHODS OF SOLUTION

Obviously any method of solution, ifit is to be of practical use, must be capable of yielding
numerical results and therefore all methods of solution are in a sense numerical. Never-
theless, it is convenient to divide methods of solution into categories which are distinguished
by the amount and nature of the preliminary algebraic treatment.
