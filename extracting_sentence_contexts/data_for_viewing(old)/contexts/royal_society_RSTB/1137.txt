s@sitive characters of the instrument are to a great extent those which diminish its

idity, it is almost impossible at present to obtain an instrument of sufficient
s@isibility for our purpose, without so slowing its movement that it takes more than

second for the mercury to complete its rise or fall. If, therefore, a series of transient
alectrical changes similar in direction, following one another at intervals of less than
peasonnd and all of equal intensity, are allowed to affect the instrument, then since the
mgvement of the meniscus due to the first change would take >; second for its comple-
‘ign, the second change will occur when the mercury is either in movement or has just
i@apleted its excursion and not returned ; a second movement is thus super-imposed
»G-the first ; so a third on the second, until a limit of fusion is reached, this being
pendent upon the fact that with each additional displacement the counter-pull of
i surface tension increases, and finally the displaced mercury is maintained ata
ew level without any additional displacement perceptible on either side of the level
Hained. It is probable that an extremely fine vibration synchronous with the rate of
sfGoossive electrical effects exists, but when the successive electromotive changes are
igiform i in amount, direction, and time relations, such a vibration must be extremely
all.
EN very different condition is introduced when these electrical changes are alternate

direction, since now each displacement by one effect, whilst still in progress, is
cnont by another in the reverse direction due to the succeeding change being of
ppposite sign to its predecessor. The effect of such a series of electrical changes even
when following one another at such short intervals as y$p second is thus clearly visible,
