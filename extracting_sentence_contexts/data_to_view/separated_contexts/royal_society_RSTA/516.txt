In a recent historical note, Peter & Dwivedi
[11] assign the merit to Alfv√©n [12], who summarized six arguments that support the corona
being heated to such high temperatures. Since then, solar physics research has sought to identify
the physical mechanism(s) that might balance the thermal conduction, radiation and solar wind
losses, first quantified by Withbroe & Noyes [2]. Researchers in the field agree upon the fact that
the origin for such temperatures is of a magnetic nature and that the energy source lies in the
solar surface plasma motions. This available energy is then transported to the upper layers of the
solar atmosphere where it gets dissipated. The exact physical processes and their contribution to
the heating of the plasma remain largely unknown or unquantified [8].
