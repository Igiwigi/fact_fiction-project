The phase map image in figure 22c confirms the presence of pure Cu and
Cu20. EDS mapping of oxygen (figure 22d) showing oxygen deficiency in many grains further
validates the above results. The presence of Cu along with CuO at high temperature might be due to the fact that above
800°C at high vacuum pressure, copper oxide transforms back to copper [35]. The oxides phase is
mostly observed at (110) orientation of Cu, while it has been almost dissolved in grains with other
orientation (figure 22b). All the Cu2O oxide particles show cube—cube ORs with matrix.
