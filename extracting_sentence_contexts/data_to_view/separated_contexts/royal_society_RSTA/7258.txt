The displacement of the
asymptote is such that a decrease in velocity on passing through the interface greater than
0:05Vy, would be conspicuous. The fact that the scatter is large and number of observations small at the greater values
of T, results in uncertainty in the gradient of velocity at the shallower depths of penetra-
tion of the rays. This uncertainty is further increased by the fact that 0S/@a becomes
smaller as @, increases, and therefore as T,, increases. This results in the calculated curves
for differing gradient values converging on one another as the range increases. It is, however, apparent from figure 14, in which the depth of penetration for station 2
is plotted against 7â€™, for a gradient of 2-5/s, that the uncertainty is confined to a depth not
greater than 100 ft.
