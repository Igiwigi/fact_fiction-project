Qo = 0.5 (blue solid lines). There exists aband gap,1 < 2 < ./T-F Qu, where the harmonic waves cannot propagate along
the structure. The dependence for the free beam K = Â«/{2 and the low-frequency asymptotics K ~ (1+ Qq1)/4./'Q as
&2 < 1are also shown (dashed lines). (Online version in colour.)

Note that Kp, =K is the same normalization as used above (K =k/./%2o), with 29 =@0/c1,
c= V/Dje.

It can be seen that the group velocity in the equipped beam is below that in the free one,
dw/ dk < 2k. This shows that a structure such as a line of resonators attached to an elastic beam is
a waveguide. Note that the band gap appears to be similar to that in the case of the string. This
is due to the fact that it is defined by the frequency-dependent inertia (the mass and the added
mass), which is the same for both cases.

Qualitatively, this effect is similar to the formation of the stop band that has been observed
in the CN case of an extensible string being used as the master body (see figure 3). The obvious
differences are of course observed due to the different orders of the dispersion equations in these
two cases; the latter includes different asymptotics of 2(K) when K + 0 and when K > oo.

(b) Discretely positioned oscillators on a flexural elastic beam (case DN)
In the case of discretely distributed oscillators, the equation becomes

(Dk* + gs*)ul* = pi (k,s) + Fa
