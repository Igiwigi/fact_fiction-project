With higher percentages of tin, the amount of eutectic
present is so great that the entire cylinder “runs down” when heated above 180° C.,
the metal thus eluding observation by the ordinary differential method during the
subsequent cooling. Even in the case of alloys containing above 25 per cent. of tin a
certain amount of the liquid eutectic exudes and runs away from the cylinder, thus
failing to impart its heat of solidification to the thermocouple on subsequent cooling. This fact must be borne in mind in connexion with the approximate quantitative
interpretation of these curves. On examining the curves of Series B it is found that the eutectic peak first appears

* The well-known “differential cooling-curves” are obtained by means of the apparatus of RoBERTS-
AusTEN, in which a specimen of the alloy under observation is allowed to cool in the same furnace, and,
therefore, at approximately the same average rate, as a standard neutral or comparison body. Similar
thermojunctions are inserted in these two cooling bodies and are so connected to the “differential”
galvanometer as to oppose one another ; any evolution or absorption of heat in the experimental body then
produces a deflection of the differential galvanometer, as it sets up a difference of temperature between the
two cooling bodies.
