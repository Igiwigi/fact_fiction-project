The quote is compelling here for two reasons. First, there is
the similarity between Fitzroy’s conclusion and what would
come to be understood through genetics via Lewontin’s analy-
sis. Second, Edwards does not argue against Fitzroy’s
interpretation. Edwards treats the apportionment of diversity
in humans as a somewhat obvious matter of fact. What he took
issue with was the implication taken from Lewontin’s paper
that one cannot do classification (including building phyloge-
nies) using genetics. Edwards would later say in an interview
‘it is essentially that there are two problems. He [Lewontin]
really wasn’t going from the variation problem to the phyloge-
netic problem’ [7, p. 422].

For his part, Lewontin in his work and later writings,
made clear that he recognized that some form of classification
is possible (e.g. [54,72])—his goal instead was to debate the
apportionment of diversity associated with existing classifi-
cations of human races. As such, both Lewontin and his
