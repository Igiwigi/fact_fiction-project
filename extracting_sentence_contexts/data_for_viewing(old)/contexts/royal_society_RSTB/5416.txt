the stimulus for division has passed as a wave across the ameeba. In every case where
apparently only some of the nuclei of a large plasmodium were dividing, careful
examination has revealed that two separate plasmodia were involved, which, owing to
their size and age, had not coalesced to form a single plasmodium.

The view has been previously put forward that the scarcity of nuclei in division in
the plasmodia indicates that the whole process is very rapidly completed. The present
investigation has fully substantiated such a conclusion, nuclear divisions being only
very rarely found. We were unable to correlate any particular conditions, such as
temperature, humidity, time of day or night when the material was fixed, with any
special tendency towards nuclear division. Recently Gurwirscs (22) has suggested
that “ mitogenetic rays” induce mitosis; the theory which he puts forward might
easily explain the fact that all the nuclei in a plasmodium divide together, but such
an idea is not supported by two associated but distinct plasmodia being found, one with
resting nuclei, while in the other the nuclei are dividing.

(b) Akaryote Stage.—When the supply of food material fails, or when the plasmodium
completely fills the host cell, growth ceases, and the organism is stimulated to produce
spores. Before this can take place, however, it appears to be necessary for the chromatin
in the nuclei to be completely rearranged. Accordingly, the nuclei pass through a
special phase called the Akaryote stage. Many investigators only very incompletely
describe the changes which occur between protomitosis and meiosis. This is probably
due to the very chaotic appearance of the nuclei, which frequently give the appearance
of having been imperfectly fixed. A critical study of many different slides, and a
comparison of several genera, has convinced us that the series of stages which we are
