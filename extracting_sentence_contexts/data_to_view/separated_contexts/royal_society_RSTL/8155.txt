> I have already called attention (in page 383) to the relations which these detached

Anedullary bundles sustained to those lodged in the inner bark, and pointed out the way

Z3n which the latter helped to equalize the resisting power of the compound vascular

Sylinder, by strengthening those parts of the woody zone which were weakened by the

reaking up of the medullary cylinder. This idea receives confirmation from the fact

_ 80 long as the central axis is occupied by an undivided vascular bundle, these cortical

uttresses are invariably wanting. In no one of the lateral diverticula which T have just

â€”described, and in which the s07/d axis invariably existed, did I find a trace of these cortical

bundles : all the facts indicate that they were growths developed in the bark at a later

mn at the same time snch specimens as the original of Plate XXII. fig. 2 showed that,

Zthey became fully grown before the disruption of the medullary cylinder had proceeded

Ato any considerable extent. The large size of the medullary rays, and the simple and conspicuous organization of
the woody wedges in Dictyorylon, enable us easily to compare its growth with that of
hving Dicotyledonous stems.
