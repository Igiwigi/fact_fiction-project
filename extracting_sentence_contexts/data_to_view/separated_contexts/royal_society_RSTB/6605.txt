The sulcus rostralis lies below the anterior part
where it lies under the genu ; it is horizontally disposed, and separates areas prae-
frontalis and praefrontalis B of E:xior Smrru, areas 10 and 11 of BropMann. In
some cases there is a sulcus within the area praefrontalis, below the sulcus rostralis,
known as the sulcus subrostralis. It is not always possible to differentiate between
the lower end of the anterior part of the sulcus cinguli and the sulcus rostralis ; in
fact, the sulcus cinguli sometimes passes well backwards on the medial part of the
frontal lobe so as to include the sulcus rostralis (compare S.12.L. and S.5.L.). GENNA
(1924) in his plates 3 and 4, suggests the same thing by labelling the lower end of
the anterior part of the sulcus cinguli “‘ esf (ros) ”’. The middle part of the sulcus cinguli is variable in length and appears to be merely
a compensatory folding between the area callosus B and the area frontalis superior
of Exxtior Smrru, the areas 6 and 24 of BRoDMANN.
