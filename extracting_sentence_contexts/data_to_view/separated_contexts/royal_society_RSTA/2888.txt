As an example, Barth et al. [16] provide :
a model for encoding norms appearing in legal standards such as HIPAA. 73
Normative concepts are often not defined explicitly, and, when they are, they are not expressed : &
in a formal language that enables a precise analysis. As a result, there is uncertainty with respect .
to which information flows are in agreement with normative concepts. In many cases, it may
be difficult to determine with reasonable certainty whether an information flow is appropriate,
whether it creates a risk of a privacy breach or even whether a privacy breach has in fact occurred. In order to bridge normative and technical concepts, the framework of contextual integrity
could in the future be equipped with formal mathematical definitions. If defined formally, its
fundamental concepts, i.e. context, information flow and norm, could provide an interface for
integrating formal privacy models into the framework.
