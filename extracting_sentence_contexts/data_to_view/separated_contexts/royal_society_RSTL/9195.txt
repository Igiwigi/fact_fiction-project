I think that the facts are decidedly in favour of the latter theory. Mr. Lockvyer's investigations have shown that most bodies give us a continuous spec-
trum, as a gas, before they condense, and many at a considerable temperature above
the boiling point. Mr. Lockyer has rightly drawn the conclusion from these facts,
that the atomic aggregation of the molecules is the canse of the different orders of
spectra. If we observe the changes in a spectrum which gradually take place on
heating or cooling a vapour, we find that the continuous spectrum is produced, not by
a widening of the bands, but by a direct replacement, which is 80metimes sudden and
sometimes gradual, and which leaves no doubt in the observer's mind that he has to
deal with two vibrating systems, and not simply with a disturbed one. I do not, of
course, mean to say that the impacts of other molecules have no observable influence.
