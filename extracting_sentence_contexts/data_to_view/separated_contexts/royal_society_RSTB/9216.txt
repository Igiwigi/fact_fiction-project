If indeed entrainment
conveys information about frequency, then discriminating
the frequency of ICMS pulse trains should be analogous to
discriminating the frequency of skin vibrations, since both
evoked periodic responses in S1 neurons. Romo showed that
the animalsâ€™ performance on the task based on ICMS was com-
parable to that based on skin vibrations. In fact, the animals
could compare the frequency of an ICMS train to that of a
skin vibration [13]. These results were significant for two
reasons. First, while previous studies had revealed a correlation
between temporal patterning in S1 and vibratory frequency
(e.g. [15]), the study showed that this patterning conveys
information about frequency using a causal manipulation of
neuronal activation.
