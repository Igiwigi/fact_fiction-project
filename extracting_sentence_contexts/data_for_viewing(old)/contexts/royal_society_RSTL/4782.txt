composition, accompanied by loss of water at a temperature of about 130* C., and is
converted into another snbstance, which I shall describe further on. When heated
to a till higher degree in a tube or retort, it gives fumes of an orange colour, which
condense on the colder parts of the vessel to a crystalline mass, consisting chiefly
of alizarine.

Rubian cannot be considered as a colouring matter in the ordinary sense of the
word. It imparts hardly any colour to mordanted cloth, when an attempt is made
to dye with it in the usual way, the alumina mordant only acquiring a slight orange,
the iron mordant a light brown colour.

Composition of Rubian.—In determining the composition of rubian, I found it
necessary to take into consideration the fact of its leaving when burnt a considerable
quantity of ash. This ash consists almost entirely of carbonate of lime. The amount
of ash is not uniform in different specimens; it is greatest when the rubian has been
purified by means of sulphuric acid, but I have never been able to obtain it in a state
in which it burns without any residue. Even after being precipitated with basic
acetate of lead and again separated from the oxide of lead, rubian leaves some ash on
being burnt, 80 that it appears as if the lime which it contains were an essential con-
stituent, or at all events, that it follows it into the lead compound, from which it
cannot be removed by means of water or alcohol.

The following results were obtained on analysis :—
