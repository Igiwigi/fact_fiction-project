And if migratory flying is the
normal activity of gregaria locusts when at or near their preferred temperature, which is the
temperature to which their various temperature reactions tend to return them, then those
reactions will also conspire to keep the insects flying ‘automatically’, as Shumakov (1940)
suggested with regard to the marching of hoppers. Since Gunn et al. (1948) recorded body
temperatures ranging up to 41° C at the time of mass stream-away, it may well be that
migrating locusts often have body temperatures within the range where activity has ceased
to be ‘normal’ and has become slightly ‘nervous’, for nervousness begins at about 36° C on
Hussein’s scale. On this scale, in fact, gregarious locusts are somewhat nervous even at the
temperature preferred by them, 40 to 42° C, and if they tend to keep to that temperature not
only in the laboratory but also, as seems probable, in flight, then migrants must be habitually
somewhat nervous. In this sense, Hussein may have been quite correct in saying that adults
in full flight are not behaving normally. That is a very different thing from saying that
migration is abnormal in the sense of being caused by temperatures that are excessive,
i.e. well above the preferred temperature.
