while benefiting from shared information and maintaining the correct quantitative values of
both modalities. With these factors identified, instead of computing reconstructions for each


problem separately in equations (2.2) and (2.4), we aim to recover both reconstructions jointly
by minimizing the following joint functional:

WE, y) = IV — Urrr(y 3 + llttm — Ugser(E)Iz + (7, E) + Ally il + AMIEL, (2.5)

where U (and the appropriate subscript) represent the nonlinear forward models, a is the JTV
weighting parameter and A is the L! regularization parameter. We here included the L'-norm
as regularizer to first stabilize the inversion process and secondly promote sparse crack-like
structures. We note that the sum of the total variation and the L!-norm in fact defines the norm
for functions of bounded variation (BV), thus the penalty in equation (2.5) can be considered as a
BV-regularization term.

Nevertheless, we need to carefully adjust the JTV regularizer to the problem at hand, since a
primary concern in the joint recovery for EIT-QSEI imaging is to preserve the quantitative values
for both modalities, while benefiting from shared information on regularity and edge alignment.
To achieve this, we first write the JTV functional J in the discrete form as follows:

H 25
Jv, E) = ° VV vil? + Ie VEnI2 + B, 26) 33
