present earthquakes being followed in the near future by a volcanic event in Mont-
serrat or elsewhere. Such predictions can only legitimately be made on the basis of
a real understanding of the complex of interacting processes and conditions which
together determine the course of such events. On the basis of the information which
has been accumulated, however, I am of the opinion that the continued decline in the
seismic activity and the simultaneous decrease in the rate of emission of gas from the
Gages soufriére following the severe earthquake of 10 November 1935 suggest that
the seismo-volcanic episode which has occurred in Montserrat in the past few years
is now drawing to a close. The results strongly suggest that the dangerous strains in
the earth’s crust in this region were relieved at least temporarily by the occurrence
of this earthquake.

These facts should not, however, be allowed to lead to a too easy optimism. On
several occasions in the past, scientific expeditions have been made to the scene of
disasters in these islands and reassuring reports have subsequently been issued on the

basis of insufficient knowledge, with serious consequences. The earth’s crust in these
regions should be regarded as a very delicately balanced structure, and a knowledge
of those factors which determine its history will only be obtained by long-continued
observations at a number of points in the island chain. The magnitude of the disasters
which have occurred in the past in these regions makes it desirable that these obser-
vations should be initiated without delay. It is very likely that the best fruits of such
