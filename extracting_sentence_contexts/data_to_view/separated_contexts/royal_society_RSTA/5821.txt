It is therefore intuitive to search for a rotationally symmetric minimizer, and this is
indeed also the nature of the structures that immediately come to mind for vorticity and strain:
strong vorticity will be observed at the core of a particularly strong vortex filament, while large
strain occurs at points such as the centre of the collision of two vortex rings. Of course, it is not
necessarily true that a rotationally symmetric optimization problem has a rotationally symmetric
minimizer. Because of this fact, we set out to search for multiple, possibly distinct minimizers of the
action: one for which we artificially enforce rotational symmetry, and potentially others for which
no symmetry is enforced. The former case reduces the problem to (2 + 1) dimensions in (r,z, t)
for cylindrical coordinates (r,@,z) in space. In this coordinate system, and using the vorticity-
streamfunction formulation for axisymmetric flows [27], the axisymmetric instanton equations
are
