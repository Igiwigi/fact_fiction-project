For a weak solution, we require this â€˜averaged equationâ€™ to hold for every smooth divergence-
free function g that is zero outside some compact subset of 92. Since u satisfies the integrability
conditions in (4.3) all the terms in (4.4) make sense. [There are many equivalent definitions of a
weak solution, but this is probably the simplest. For example, one can take g to be a function
that also depends on time, or alternatively a finite linear combination of eigenfunctions of the
linear Stokes operator, see [3] or Ch. 3 of [5], for details. In order to be meaningful all the various
formulations require u to satisfy (4.3).]

Note that, because we have integrated once by parts in the linear term, a weak solution only
needs to be smooth enough to make sense of one derivative, and then only in an integrated sense (the
required smoothness is precisely that in (4.3)). The fact that the formulation involves integration
is significant: functions can be very bad and still integrable. For example, if (qn)72, is an
enumeration of the rationals between 0 and 1 and

while f is integrable (and so finite almost everywhere) it is unbounded in a neighbourhood of
every rational.
