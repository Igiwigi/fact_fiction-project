These show that
no true diastema existed in this region, and that the crown of the incisor was in
contact with the canine tooth, 7 or 8 mm. from its alveolar margin. The relationship
of the upper premolar may be appreciated by the reconstruction (fig. 4) carried out on
the left side. This reveals the fact that the crown of the upper canine projected
below the level of the mesial margin of the upper premolar for a distance of nearly
7mm. No interstitial facets are present indicating contact between the upper canine
and premolar teeth. The articulation of the lower premolar teeth with the upper canine is deduced from
a study of the facet on this latter tooth.
