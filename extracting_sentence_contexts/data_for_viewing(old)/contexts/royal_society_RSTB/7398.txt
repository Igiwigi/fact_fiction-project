(type A), whilst others bore ‘papillate’ stigmas and more finely reticulate pollen (type B).
In the same year Iversen (1940) drew attention to the fact that the very homogeneous genus
Armeria can be separated into two groups very distinctly different, in that one (of European-
Mediterranean distribution) is dimorphic and parasterile, whilst the other, which includes
the holarctic form of northern America and Asia, has only monomorphic self-sterile species
in it. A. vulgaris Willd. is shown to be dimorphic and to include the Atlantic and maritime
var. maritima and the mountain var. alpina. On the other hand, the nearest holarctic

Armeria, A. labradorica, which now exists in northern Greenland, is monomorphic. In view
of these facts it is of particular interest to note not only that Armeria pollen occurs in these
late-Glacial Cornish deposits, but that since both A and B types of pollen occur, the
dimorphic species was present. The same condition is found in late-Glacial deposits in the
Lea Valley where calyces also occur, and in the Irish late-Glacial.

The pollen may thus be referred in all probability to.A. vulgaris s.l. (Iversen), and its
presence undoubtedly indicates open conditions.

Artemisia

The pollen of Artemisia, long confused with that of Salix, has been recently shown to be
in fact readily distinguishable, and many workers have now established it as an indicator
species of high value (Erdtman 1943; Iversen 1941). It has been shown to be present in
