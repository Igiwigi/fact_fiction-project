is visually larger for the MD mode. Therefore, the experimentally observed enhanced THG at the
MD resonance, when compared with the THG output at the ED resonance, can be validated by a
simple local-field hypothesis. These results make the MD resonances of high-index nanoparticles
very relevant to nonlinear-optical applications in nanophotonics.


Moreover, direct numerical simulations suggest that the THG response takes place at the
MD resonance of an isolated silicon disc, whereas at the ED resonance the nonlinear signal
appears to be rather weak (figure 4). The calculations provide the same value of the TH intensity
enhancement from the nanostructured area in comparison with the intensity from the substrate,
which is observed in the experiment (figure 2b). A significant enhancement of nonlinear process
efficiency is also predicted at the MQ resonance; an experimental verification of this fact could
be interesting for ultraviolet photonics applications. An apparent red spectral shift of the TH
signal with respect to the spectral position of the MD mode-associated dip is consistent with the
integrated electric field in figure 3.

4. Conclusion

We have studied the THG from silicon nanodiscs at their Mie-type ED and MD resonances.
The enhanced upconversion efficiency at the MD resonance of the nanodiscs has been observed
owing to the strong field confinement, whereas the ED resonance yielded almost no nonlinear
conversion. The experimental findings have been supported by rigorous nonlinear numerical
calculations, where considerably lower average local field density and overall THG has been
detected at the electric resonance, when compared with the magnetic resonance. We believe that
