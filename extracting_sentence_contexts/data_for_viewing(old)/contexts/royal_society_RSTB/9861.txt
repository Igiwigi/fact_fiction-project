cesses affecting fitness, one can decompose the response to
selection using linear regression coefficients on self and partner
genotypes. At the same time, we wonder if the debate regarding
the generality of Hamilton’s rule has had unintended conse-
quences where repeated affirmations of the possibility of
writing some rule of the form rb — c > 0 led to a sort of compla-
cency among researchers that kept using the simple, canonical
version without considering whether its assumptions hold. As
we have discussed, the canonical Hamilton’s rule is insufficient
in the presence of class structure and cannot reflect non-additive
pay-offs in a simple way without subsuming them into average
additive effects that are frequency dependent. These are
well-known facts in the theoretical literature, but we find that
empirical research has rarely used these elaborations on the
canonical Hamilton’s rule (with few exceptions, e.g. [67]).
Whatever the cause, this disconnect between theoretical
results and their application in empirical research hinders
progress in the study of social behaviour. We believe that
the lineage view of invasion fitness that we espouse here pro-
vides a useful and accurate biological interpretation of the
mathematical theory of inclusive fitness that will begin to
bridge this disconnect and stimulate progress in the field.
