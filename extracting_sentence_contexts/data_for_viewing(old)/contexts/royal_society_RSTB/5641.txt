to the substratum is augmented by accessory organs of attachment, such as the pads
on the outer rays of the paired fins of Garra and Sicyopterus, the papillated lips and
the various kinds of spines found in Blepharoceride. In swifter and swifter currents
even the sucker of Garra is reduced and is replaced by pads on the fins.

After discussing the structures of attachment in fishes in general, KyLx states that
they are to be found more commonly in the marine than in the torrential fauna. He
explains this as follows: ‘‘ The origin of these discs must be referred, therefore, simply
to the habit of resting on the bottom, and the necessary condition of their development
appears to be the suitable position of either the ventral or pectoral fins. The sucker
is only developed on the anterior half of the belly, that is, when the ventral fins are
anterior. The absence of suckers in the freshwater fishes is thus accounted for by the
fact that in most of them the ventrals are posterior.” Except that the suckers have
developed in response to bottom life in strong currents none of KyLr’s other conclusions
is borne out by the facts adduced here. In my previous papers (19236, 1925, 1927),
I have indicated the main reasons for the absence of suckers in the majority of the
torrential fauna, but it is necessary to summarize here the main points.

The currents of the sea and the breakers of the sea-shore are different from the flow
of a torrential stream in two respects. Firstly, in the case of the latter the flow is always
in one direction, whereas the marine currents flow in various directions. Secondly, the
marine currents may attain a considerable swiftness, but they never rush at the rate
of a mountain torrent. Under such conditions a sucker is more useful in marine
organisms, because in the first place it can resist pressure from all sides, and secondly,
because the pressure is not very great, and a relatively small sucker is capable of holding
