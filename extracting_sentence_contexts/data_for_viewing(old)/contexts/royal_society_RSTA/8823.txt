SPHERICAL ABERRATION FOR A SYMMETRICAL OPTICAL SYSTEM. 33

All distances parallel to the axis will be denoted by a (the attribution of the
symbol being indicated in each case) and will be measured positively from left to
right.

The longitudinal aberration will be denoted by Ax, with the suffix of the medium,
and will be reckoned positive when the point of intersection of the ray with the axis
is to the right of the geometrical image. Thus Aw, = J,I,. This is opposite to the
usual convention which is based on the fact that for positive or convergent lenses, I, is
generally to the left of J,,; but, in the first place, this is not universally true, and, in
the second place, the convention adopted by us was found more convenient in handling
the algebra.

It is to be noted that, with the notation used, the well-known formula -for a lens

direction.

The distances between successive refracting surfaces we denote by’c, with the suffix
of the medium.
