to the circumstance of the fluid being too thick ; but as we shall presently find, this,
perhaps, may admit of a different interpretation. My first object having been to learn how small a number of spermatozoa is snfli-
cient to fecundate an egg, it may well be supposed that the facts just mentioned
were exceedingly puzzling, and they were rendered still more $0 by the cireumstance
that a different result occurred with three other eggs from the same frog, employed
at the same time as those in the preceding experiments. Two of these eggs, placed
like the others, each in a separate cell, in a mixture of one part of seminal fluid to
8ix parts of water, #00 hours and twenty minutes after the fluid had been obtained,
became fecundated. In each of these the chamber was formed ahove the yelk,
segmentation took place, and proceeded regularly, and each egg subsequently pro-
duced an embryo.
