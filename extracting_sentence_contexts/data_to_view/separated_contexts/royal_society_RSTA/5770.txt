For
this reason, K(sr, 1) manifolds are said to be aspherical. This general class of K(z, 1) manifolds includes, as special cases, the 3-torus and five additional
manifolds, finitely covered by the torus, that are said to be of ‘flat type’ since they are the only
compact, connected, orientable 3-manifolds that each, individually, admits a flat metric and thus
supports spatially compactified versions of the FLRW spaces of flat type (i.e. k = 0 models). Other K(r, 1) spaces include the vast set of compact hyperbolic manifolds H?/I, where here
I is a discrete torsion-free (i.e. no non-trivial element has finite order) co-compact subgroup of
the Lie group Isom*(H®) of orientation-preserving isometries of H® that, in fact, is Lie-group
isomorphic to the proper orthochronous Lorentz group SO*(3,1). Each of these, individually,
supports spatially compactified versions of the FLRW space-times of constant negative (spatial)
curvature (i.e. k = —1 models). Additional K(z,1) manifolds include the trivial circle bundles over higher genus surfaces Zp
for p>2 (where Lp designates a compact, connected, orientable surface of genus p) and non-
trivial circle bundles over Zp for p = 1.
