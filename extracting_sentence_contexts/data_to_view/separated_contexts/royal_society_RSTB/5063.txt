Tn the corium of the villi and round the crypts of LreBERKUHN is a complex network of
anastomosing fibres, which form a dense sub-epithelial plexus. The fibres forming this
plexus originate partly as axones of cells in Mrtssnerâ€™s plexus and partly from extrinsic
fibres of vagal or sympathetic origin (probably from both these latter sources). The
fact that stimulation of the vagus causes increased secretion of the gastric glands (ANREP
and Sussa Rav, unpublished observations) suggests that processes of neurones in either
the myenteric or sub-mucous plexus are involved in the production of this secretory
reaction. Fibres from the sub-mucous plexus certainly pass up to terminate in relation
to the musculature of the villi (fig. 28), and it seems probable that fibres from this plexus

also provide the efferent innervation of the glandular crypts. Fine fibrils from the just-mentioned sub-epithelial plexus penetrate the epithelium
of the villi and terminate around and between the epithelial cells (fig.
