448 HONOR B. FELL ON THE ORIGIN AND

Two explants were fixed after 24 hr. in vitro. The curvature of the plates was much
more pronounced than in the corresponding controls and extended much farther back.
A keel rudiment had also appeared in the front half of the plate. The ventral edge of
the plates had become bent at right angles to the corpus sterni, as in normal develop-
ment, but a second almost right-angled bend occurred a short distance ventral to the
first (fig. 31, Plate 39), so that most of the keel, instead of projecting vertically, lay nearly
parallel with the surface of the clot. The keel consisted of early procartilage which was
not yet sharply defined from the surrounding tissue, and the general orientation of cells
in the keel region was similar to that already described in early cultures of the complete
sternum. The isolated plates formed a longer keel rudiment than the explants of the
complete sternum. This was probably due to the fact that in the half-sterna the keel
was better nourished than in the complete sterna owing partly to its peripheral position
in the culture, and partly to the fact that a large part of it lay parallel with the culture
medium instead of projecting vertically away from it as in the complete sterna. The
posterior lateral processes were visible, though still mesenchymatous. Many necrotic
cells occurred in the connective tissue in the morphologically median part of the
explant. There was usually more connective tissue on the ventral than on the dorsal
side of the sternal plate, especially in the keel region.

Seven cultures were fixed after 2 daysâ€™ growth, four of which (fig. 324, Plate 40) were
explanted with the dorsal surface upwards. As compared with the control halves and
with the 24 hr. cultures, the curvature of the plates had increased and chondrification
was more advanced. The proximal part of the keel was chondrified but the distal part
