Here we have, as might have been expected, a much more abundant and large «
crystallisation. Moreover, the 8, except in one spot far removed from «, has not
broken up into the striation. This phenomenon, seen also in the preceding chill, is
one reason, perhaps the most conclusive, for the truth of our view that the striation
did not exist in the 8 at temperatures above 500°, but is a change produced during
and sometimes after the chill, and due to the fact that the B of Sn 14 is so rich in
copper that at low temperatures it is in a very unstable state and readily breaks up
into a copper-rich and a tin-rich phase, thereby producing the striation. It is clear
that 8 slowly cooled below the JC’ line, out of which « has already crystallised, will
be less supersaturated and therefore more likely to bear a low temperature unchanged
than the B chilled above the JC’ line. For the same reason Sn 9 chilled at 546°
contains a mother-substance of 8 unstriated.
