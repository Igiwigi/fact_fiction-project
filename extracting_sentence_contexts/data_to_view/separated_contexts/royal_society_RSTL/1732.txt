The next set of experiments were made with thin circular discs of brass,
having about the same thickness as common thick post paper. Twenty
pieces, screwed together in a vice, measured *08 inch ; consequently the thick-
ness of each of the brass discs may be assumed equal to 004 inch. One of
these discs was intended to be 2:06 in diameter, in order to correspond with
the cylinders above mentioned ; but it is in fact somewhat larger, being 207 ;
and weighs 28 grains : the second was 3-01 inches in diameter, and weighed
57-5 grains: and the third was 4 inches in diameter, and weighed 106-5
grains. Their specific gravity I found to be 8:450. The long brass rod above
mentioned* was then tapped with a screw hole at 38 inches from the knife
edge, and the three discs, in succession, were respectively fastened thereto ;
and swung with their flat sides opposed to the line of motion.
