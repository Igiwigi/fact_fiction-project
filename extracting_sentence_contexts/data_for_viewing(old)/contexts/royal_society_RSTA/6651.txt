We also denote tan7/tany = ¢,, so that p goes from +1 to —a, across the space M’z” and
o goes from g, to 1 across z’M. If then we put /,(A) = g,(c), etc., we find from (50) after
some reduction

#0) =20-o e+e’ aay. (51)

This expression in fact gives, over the aerofoil and to the left of it within the Mach cone, the
‘reflected’ wave corresponding to the wave g,(7) coming from the edge Oz’. The complete
solution can then be written, for points on the aerofoil surface
