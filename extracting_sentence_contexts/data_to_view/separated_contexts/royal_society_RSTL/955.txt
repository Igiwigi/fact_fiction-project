Mr. MAcarTNey left me a drawing of the exter-
nal appearance. of the gland; when the stomach was in a
distended state, in which the muscular contraction between
the two portions was destroyed. He aid nothing about
the structure of the gland, and as it was a subject, which
did not then engage my attention, I thought no more about
it, In the course of the present enquiry it occurred to my
recollection, and upon comparing this gland with that of the
beaver (with which it corresponds very minutely in its internal
structure) it becomes a fact of no small importance in forming
a series of glandular structures belonging to the stomach: in
making use of this fact, I have great pleasure in acknowledg-
ing the source, from whence my first knowledge of it was
derived. This glandular structure viewed externally is like
a mulberry, being made up of a number of small projections ;

small openings ; these again lead to several processes, as has
been described and delineated in the glandular structure of the
beaver. The first portion of the stomach forms about 4 of the whole,
while the second is only the remaining third ; internally the
membrane has no peculiar appearance, and is uniformly the
same in both portions.
