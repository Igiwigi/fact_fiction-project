now varying only five additional parameters relevant to the second COVID-19 wave (social
distancing for schools, leisure, and non-leisure activities, November lockdown and B.1.1.7 variant
infectiousness), the output of which is given by the green lines. One iteration of HM was
performed to reduce the five-dimensional parameter space in each case, and a new set of runs
designed, which are shown as blue lines in figure 4. We see reasonable matches to the first part
of the second COVID-19 wave, with perhaps a late take-off in early September, and a partial
overshoot in November to December, suggesting that JUNE may well provide acceptable matches
after a full HM.

To give more detail, figure 6 shows a single unsmoothed run (red lines), from this final batch,
but now for hospital deaths and total deaths for England and all seven regions, and shows the
sort of quality of matches we are seeing so far. The black points give the (unsmoothed) death
data and the combined uncertainties due to o¢ and o, shown as the blue lines. The fact that
JUNE matches several regions simultaneously, at least over the first wave, without resorting to
any region specific parameters, suggests that geographical variations in the relative importance


in different types of interaction drove/affected the different epidemic curves in those regions.
Further, more detailed investigation to confirm this is of course required. We leave the extension
to 2021 and beyond to the future work, as this requires the complex behavioural and partial
restrictions (on travel, visiting relatives, etc.) imposed over the December 2020 Christmas period
(the ‘cancelled Christmas’) and the January to April 2021 lockdown and subsequent staggered
release to be implemented and tested, possibly requiring additional time-dependent parameters,
which is the ongoing work (although we note that vaccines and multiple variants have already
been implemented in JUNE). We also note that the process of using complex models combined
