S are operative in the activation process.

By (2) The effect of decreasing crystal size is to increase n, and is likely to have a noticeable
& effect in diminishing the quantity of initiator required for stable build-up.

5 (3) The induction period to ignition is likely to be affected by the nature of the surrounding
& gas. The known effect of a vacuum in inhibiting the detonation of small quantities of mercury
3 fulminate is in accordance with this theory.

gS (4) Once the adjacent layers have been brought to detonation, the initiation of other
g layers becomes a property of the stable detonation wave, whose compression ratio and
iS velocity are determined by the density and temperature of the explosion products of the
initiator, notofthesurrounding gas. This accounts for the fact that although mercury fulminate
may be more easily initiated than lead azide, the stable wave in fulminate may not lead to
as rapid a pressure rise in other explosives placed in contact, as in the case of lead azide.

(5) Ifconditions in the heat test are such that the critical intensity of shock wave does not
build up, the initiator will merely decompose thermally and show a ‘failure’ (parts II (1),
(2) and (3)).

Although this simplified picture of co-operative initiation of detonation may require
modification as more information becomes available, it forms a useful basis for further
experimental work on initiators.
