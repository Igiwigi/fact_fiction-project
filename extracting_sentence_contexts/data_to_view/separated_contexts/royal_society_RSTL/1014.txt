electrified for four hours with like results, faded and died. * The facts shew that the electrical powers of decomposition
act even upon living vegetable matter; and there are some
phznomena which seem to prove that they operate likewise
upon living animal systems. When the fingers, after having
been carefully washed with pure water, are brought in con-
tact with this fluid in the positive part of the circuit, acid
matter is rapidly developed, having the characters of a mix-
ture of muriatic, phosphoric, and sulphuric acids : and if a
similar trial be made in the negative part, fixed alkaline matter
is as quickly exhibited. The acid and alkaline tastes produced upon the tongue, in
Garvanic experiments, seem to depend upon the decompo-
sition of the saline matter contained in the living animal sub-
stance, and perhaps in the saliva.
