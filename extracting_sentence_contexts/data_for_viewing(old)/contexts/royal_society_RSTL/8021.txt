midship section is a little oyer 350 tons, and the distance between the centre of pressure
and the centre of gravity of the section is about 84%; feet, 80 that the bending-moment
due to this pressure equals 3120 foot-tons. This is the maximum value occurring at
the midship section, where we have seen the hogging-moment due to the vertical forces
to be 100 foot-tons only, 80 that at that section the former bending-moment is that which
virtually fixes the limit of strain. Greater interest attaches, however, to the comparison
between the two maximum yalues of the bending-moment. The absolute maximum
moment, produced by the vertical forces has been found to be 12,000 foot-tons, and the
moment produced by the longitudinal pressure is therefore a little more than one fourth
of this amount. As compared with the © Minotaur,” we find, then, that the bending-mo-
ment due to longitudinal pressure is very much less in actual amount for the * Bellero-
phon ;" but that, in proportion to the moment resulting from the unequal distribution of
the weight and buoyancy, it is much larger in the shorter ship. This fact prepares us for
the conclusion arrived at by Dr. YouxG in his Report on the diagonal system,—that in the
short full ships of war in use at the commencement of this century the moment due to
longitudinal pressure sometimes amounted to more than one third of the maximum mo-
ment produced by vertical forces. Dr. YouxG's method was incorrect, but his estimate
of the relative magnitude of the bending-moments is probably not very far from the
truth.

One other example must suffice for this branch of the 8ubject. In the « Audacious,'
when afloat in still water, the pressure on the midship section has been found to be
about 295 tons, and the distance between the centre of pressure and the centre of gravity
