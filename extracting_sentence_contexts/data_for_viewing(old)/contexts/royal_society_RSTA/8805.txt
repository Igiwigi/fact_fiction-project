theory, 7.¢., inversely as the square of the velocity at the middle point of the half-
period.

* When « is much less than 45 degrees the method breaks down, as « cannot be determined satisfactorily
from the observational curves. The method explained in (A), p. 343, could then be employed. This is
equivalent to assuming q = 0 and using formula (16) to determine « given sin $2 and A. Under these
conditions sin 4 is so small that the value of g does not appreciably affect either the value of s or the shape
of the curve of fy against 6.

+ Theoretically, s should increase while g should remain roughly constant. But sin 4a is common to
the first and second half-period, while is determined mainly by the shape of the curve near the maximum.
Hence, in general, « alone varies between the first and second half-periods. It appears that the result of
varying « only in formule (15, 16) is to produce a fictitious decrease in g while the increase of s is diminished
as may be seen in Table II. For this reason mean values for the whole period are used in constructing
figs. 1 and 2.
