The structure of the fully-established embryonal primordium in Man is illustrated in
Pl. 20, fig. 118. The figure is a photomicrograph (by kind permission of Dr. FLortan)
of a transverse section through the Beneke embryo (StRAHL-BENEKE, Â°10), a short
distance in front of the primitive streak, and serves to demonstrate very clearly the
cardinal fact that the early human embryo, just like that of the Pithecoid, is formed
of two superimposed vesicles, the amnio-embryonal and yolk-sac vesicles, enclosed
by an investing layer of mesoderm and situated close below the chorion in an extensive
exoccelomic cavity. The primordium is suspended from the chorion by the connecting
stalk, which, as we have already seen (ante, p. 102, and text-fig. 17*), has precisely the
same relations and, in all probability, the same mode of development as that of the
Pithecoid.
