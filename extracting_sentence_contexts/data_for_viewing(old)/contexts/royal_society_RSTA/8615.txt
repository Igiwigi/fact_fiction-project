Previous Experimental Results.

The stability of the steady motion of a viscous liquid between two concentric rotating
cylinders has been studied experimentally by Matnock and by Coverrs. These
experiments have already been mentioned. The object which both these experimenters
had in view was to determine the viscosity of water by measuring the drag exerted by a
rotating cylinder on another concentric one which was at rest, the space between them
being filled with water. The instability noticed by both of them was inferred from the
fact that the relation between speed of rotation and viscous drag of the liquid ceased
to be a linear one when the speed of rotation was increased beyond a certain limit.
Using this test for instability, Mannock found that steady flow was unstable at all
speeds of the inner cylinder when the outer one was fixed, but that when the outer
cylinder was rotated the flow was stable for low speeds, unstable for high speeds,
and sometimes stable and sometimes unstable over a range of intermediate speeds.

No indication of the existence of any sharp or definite criterion for stability was
observed.
