Ass0c.), that in any such
supposition the results of the experiments are directly opposed to one of the fundamental
laws of motion, viz. that action and reaction are equal. In these experiments a hot
body causes a cold body to recede, while a cold body causes the hot body to approach ;
s0 that if both the bodies were free to move, we should have the cold body running
away and the hot body running after it. This fact is, I take it, a conclusive proof that
the force does not act from body to body, but between each body and the medium in
which it is placed ; that each body, as it were, propels itself through the surrounding
medium in a direction opposite to its hottest side. The truth of this reasoning has been set beyond all doubt by a very beautiful experiment
made by Dr. ScxvsreR.
