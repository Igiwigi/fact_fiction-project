attending to rays and to the figure, viz.,

AC _ Vcose + vcos@
t ~ sin(i + e)/cose *

So the equations for reflection and refraction can be written down at once, thus:

V+veos(i—pte) V—veos(i’+p—e') Vip — v/p?cos(j — o — e”)
sin (i + e) a sin (i’ — e’) = sin (j — e”) 2

together with the values of the aberration angles, obtained, say, by resolving th
wave and drift velocities perpendicular to the ray, or resultant direction of advance
and expressing the fact that they must neutralize each other ;

” sin € sin & p sin e”

Vv sn@i—$) sin’ +4) sin(j— 4)

These two sets of equations contain the entire solution, and of course » may b
wrilten p/p, if it is a question of passage from one medium to another instead 0!
from vacuum to a medium; the V and v then expressing speeds in first medium.

value of the coefficient of aberration measured by a zenith sector full of water, there
should, we see, on FResNeL’s theory, have been a slight discrepancy, but one wholly
