In this experiment the genetic spiral was
reversed permanently at the angle /|â€”/, and the asymmetry of J, was also reversed, so that
here again the longer flank of 7, was on the opposite side of the apex from the centre of J,. The asymmetry of /;, however, is difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis proposed
above which therefore remains for the present only a possibility to be borne in mind. Since the asymmetry of J; is at present not understood it will not be described here, but
the main facts are recorded in table 3 and in the figures. Discussion AND CONCLUSIONS

From the experiments on Rhoeo discolor reported above and from observations made on
normal plants, information has been obtained with regard to three main questions. These
questions concern the manner in which a leaf primordium is determined and develops,
the factors locating the position in which a primordium is determined and the causes of
the asymmetry of the primordium.
