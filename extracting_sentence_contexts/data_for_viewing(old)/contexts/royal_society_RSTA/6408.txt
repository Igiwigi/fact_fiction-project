doctrine’ [1]. Spinoza argued that ‘this doctrine of final causes turns Nature completely upside
down, for it regards as an effect that which is in fact a cause, and vice versa’ [2]. This conceptual
inversion of the cause-effect relation, sometimes called backward causation, has done much to
discredit teleology. It implied that an unrealized state is able to influence a current physical
process to bring that state into existence. This is of course physically implausible. The reality
is somewhat less exotic. Human agents experience purposeful action as a disposition to achieve
an end that is represented in advance as a possible form which somehow influences the selection
of efficient means to achieve it. Of course, human agency evolved from the less-developed but
nonetheless end-directed dynamics that is characteristic of all life forms. So, the minimal basis of
teleological causality should be reflected in the organization of even the simplest living systems.
This suggests that we should be able to identify a primitive homologue of this pre-specified form
and determine how it is able to organize work to increase the probability that its form is realized.

Twentieth-century theorists endeavoured to overcome the problematic implications of
