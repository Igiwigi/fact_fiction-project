lesh-forming ” or more specially respiratory and fat-forming capacity of the foods, to be
zepresented, approximately, .by the collective or total non-nitrogenous constituents, and
the © fesh-forming ” capacity to be indicated, conditionally, by the collective or total
enous constituents of the respective foods. Indeed—neither is our existing know-
ledge of the adaptation to the various exigencies of the animal economy of the different
compounds which our foods supply, so far advanced—nor are our special facts in regard
to the composition of the animal aliments we have analysed, of snch a character—as to
Fender it desirable to attempt, at present, any more exact mode of classification. With
Segard to the varying capacity for the purposes of the system of the different non-nitro-
Jenous constituents, we shall, however, make ome numerical estimates further on.
80 far as the several nitrogenous constituents are concerned, we are not in a posi-
EN to reduce to the form of wumerical illustration any distinctions that might be drawn
tween them. In fact, as already stated, we are not even prepared to give an estimate
&f how much of the nitrogen of the animal substances we have analysed was due to
latin and chondrin-yielding matters, and how much to the 80-called protein-com-
:Zounds; yet, on the assumption that the former substances are not to be reckoned as
© h-forming,” our estimates of the amounts of such material in the animal s8ubstances
2 question, would be in excess by at least the quantity of gelatin and chondrin-yielding
matters which the total or collective nitrogenous substance may contain,
Zlt is proposed, then, on the present occasion, to confine attention to the contrast be-
een the composition of the estimated consumable portions of the animals analysed, and

gn be taken to be illustrated by the relation of the non-nitrogenous to the collective
ogenous constituents, in the respective foods,
