However, remarkably enough, it can be shown that the full RVM derived from QFT actually
mimics simultaneously the two model types that we have studied here, and therefore it benefits
from the phenomenological virtues of them both [141]. Obviously, more work and the analysis of upcoming data in the next few years will be needed
to confirm the phenomenological soundness of the RVM [148]. However, irrespective of the fate
of these tensions in the future to come, two important facts will remain: (i) QFT in FLRW space—
time predicts the current existence of a mild dynamical vacuum component ~H? on top of the
leading cosmological term in each epoch, and (ii) the renormalization performed of the VED is
such that no fine-tuning is needed to study its dynamic evolution throughout the cosmic history. Finally, we should add that inspite of the fact that our study focused on the zero-point energy
of a free scalar field non-minimally coupled to gravity, we conjecture that similar results should
hold good in the general case with interactions, since the expansion of the effective action in



powers of momenta in the context of FLRW space-time should essentially result in a momentum-
independent value (the VEV of the effective potential) plus an expansion in (even) powers of H
(thanks to general covariance). Data accessibility.
