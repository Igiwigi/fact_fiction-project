Bastian has for many years contended that the ordinary division of nerve centres
or parts of the same into sensory and motor respectively is misleading, and that not
only has the statement that the source of a nerve centre’s discharge is the motor part

* By the term “kinetogenetic portion” we have styled that part of a centre in which the potential
energy is converted into kinetic.

of it no basis of actual fact, but that it is more philosophical to associate such source
with the sensory part.

Among the considerations which favour this view are the following :—The.
undoubted physiological resemblance which exists between the succession of events in
a voluntary or reflex movement, respectively, and the analysis of such psychological
events as are known to be concomitants of the former. The psychological phenomena
of reflex action show that the afferent impulse in all cases precedes the efferent dis-
charge ; psychological analysis also shows that muscular sense impressions similarly
precede those discharges which evoke “ voluntary ” coordinated movements. Hence
he concluded that since the sensory excitation always precedes the efferent output, the
former must have primary importance, in other words, that the development of kinetic
energy must take place in the afferent side of the centre. To express this view
