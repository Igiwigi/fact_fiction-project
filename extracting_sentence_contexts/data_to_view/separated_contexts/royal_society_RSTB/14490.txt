Euclidean: Banino et al. [216] and [217] show that grid
cell-like patterns can spontaneously emerge when neural
networks are trained to perform path integration. Banino
et al. [216] incorporated this ‘grid network’ into a deep
reinforcement learning agent, and further showed that this
agent’s performance had (unlike a comparison agent) all the
hallmarks of a Euclidean spatial metric, such as distance
estimation and ‘vector navigation’ (shortcuts to remembered
locations [179,218,219]). They therefore conclude that grid
cells, in both biological systems and machines, ‘furnish
agents with a Euclidean spatial metric’.

...we argue that grid-like representations furnish agents with a

Euclidean geometric framework — paralleling the proposed com-

putational role in mammals as an early developing Kantian-like

spatial scaffold that serves to organize perceptual experience...

(From Banino et al. [216].)

Non-Euclidean: By contrast, at our meeting and in [220], Ida
Momennejad argues that it’s the non-Euclidean aspects of
place and grid cells that need accounting for, such as the distor-
tions of grid cell firing fields by rewards, as well as the fact that

the majority of distance estimates in the hippocampus reflect
path distance (taking into account obstacles) rather than
direct Euclidean distance [221,222]. Reinforcement learning has been proposed as a way
of capturing these non-Euclidean properties of place and
grid cells. Gustafson & Daw [223] argue that an emphasis
on path rather than Euclidean distance reflects the fact that
place and grid cells ‘are well adapted to support reinforce-
ment learning’, since efficient reinforcement learning
requires that the inputs (place and grid cells) are already
articulated in terms of the goals of navigation:

Importantly, this exercise views the brain’s spatial codes less as a

representation for location per se, and instead [as] a value function

over state space — a mapping of location to value.
