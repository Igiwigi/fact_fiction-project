until all eyolution of gas had ceased. In the experiments at 100* and at other tem-
peratures, the water was first brought to the temperature required, then poured on
the mixed substances and the mixture kept at the same temperature, either boiling or
in a water-bath, during the action. In the experiments with oxide of silver, to deter-
mine the silver reduced, the residue, after the evointion of the gas had ceased, was
treated with very dilute hydrochloric acid, with which it was allowed to remain in
contact at least twelve hours. All oxide was thus conyerted into chloride, The fluid
was now filtered from the residue and the hydrochloric acid washed out, the bulk of the
solid substance being till kept in the flask in which the experiment was made. From
this residue, consisting of chloride of silver and metallic silver, the silver was extracted
by boiling with nitric acid, the substance on the filter being added to the rest and
the filter also treated with acid. The solution was diluted and the silver dissolved,
which was in fact the silver reduced, estimated as chloride. It is plain, that whether
the oxide were reduced to metal or to a lower degree of oxidation, this silver must
ï¬†ill be a correct measure of the oxygen lost. This method of determining the loss of
oxygen I followed in all the experiments with silver compounds.

My first experiments were made before I had ascertained all the points necessary
for the careful preparation of the peroxide, and the preparations used for these con-
tained considerably less per-centage of oxygen than that which I afterwards readily
procured, and contained also impurities from which the other preparations were
free; in these experiments also the oxygen was determined only with bichromate of
potash and hydrochloric acid. These circumstances in no way affect their general
