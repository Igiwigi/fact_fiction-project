A similar calculation may be carried out for the K-spectra, for which N,(£) rises
as E}. But the necessary integral does not converge for the infinite limit. Numerical
integration, using the value E,,—10a?, gives the curve also represented in figure 11.
This shows the degree of closeness with which the E! curve (dashed) is followed. An
extrapolation (shown dotted) of the part of the curve above the value E=0 according
to an E? law gives a definite end-point, as is found experimentally. This, as shown by

the dotted line, differs by about 2a? from the theoretical end-point. But the amount
of this difference is much more sensitive to the actual value taken for the upper limit
E,, than is the corresponding quantity for the /,-spectra. This fact makes it almost
impossible to estimate a? from the K-spectra, except as regards order of magnitude.
However, the value 10a? for £,, gives the correct form of the L,-spectra, and we think
it may be fairly accurate to assume the same value for the K-spectra and to correct
the extrapolated end-point by the value 2a’.

To summarize this discussion, it seems that the theory of the broadening of levels
of a band accounts adequately for the features of the /(£)/v> curves for negative and
small positive values of £. It gives correctly the different peculiarities of the main
bands of the K- and L,-spectra, as well as providing an explanation of their very diffuse
tailing-away towards low energies.

A few words may be added with respect to the short wave-length tailing of metal
