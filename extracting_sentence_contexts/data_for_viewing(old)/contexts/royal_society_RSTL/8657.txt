any interest in anght beyond their own immediate sensations, paid no attention to, or
looked vacantly and indifferently at, what formerly would have excited intense curiosity,
sat stupidly quiet or went to sleep, varying this with restless and purposeless wanderings
to and fro, and generally appeared to have lost the faculty of intelligent and attentive
observation.

Perhaps this condition may be attributed to the constitutional disturbance excited by
the operative procedure alone; but the effects of this are capable in a great degree of
elimination; and in the record of snbsequent experiments it will be seen that after
operations of equal severity marked differences are observable according to the part of
the brain which was destroyed. The animals seem to bear the operation with com-
paratively little constitutional disturbance ; and this is testified by the fact that they
continue to eat and drink heartily within a few hours, and often less, after a large
portion of the brain has been removed.

The phenomena occurring towards the latter end of the periods of observation are
more to be regarded as signs of constitutional disturbance, and as indications of the
adyance of inflammatory softening or morbid process into other cerebral regions. The
spasmodic motor affections, as well as the paretic condition seen in regard to certain
movements, are to be explained by the implication of motor centres, the nature and
position of which will be illustrated in the next series of experiments.
