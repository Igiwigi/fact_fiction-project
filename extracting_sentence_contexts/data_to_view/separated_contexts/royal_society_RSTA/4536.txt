This vertical jet at the centre of the
transient crater is generated by the same mechanism that causes a splash after a stone
falls into water. The gravitational collapse of the central jet generates another wave,
the so-called collapse wave (figure 1 IVa). In fact, the formation of the central jet and
subsequent collapse may repeat several times (figure 1 IVaâ€”VIa), and a train of collapse
waves is formed [25]. Note that the first signal originating from the collapse is a wave
trough (figure 1 IVa), because of the inward directed flow field, and it may cancel out
the first signal of the rim wave. The amount of water displaced by this process may be
comparable to the total mass displaced from the transient crater (see [28,29] for simple
analytic estimates of the size of the transient crater relative to the kinetic energy of
the impactor).
