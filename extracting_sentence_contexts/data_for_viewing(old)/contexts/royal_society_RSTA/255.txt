on the landscape. As questions are raised, observations noted, and experiments
designed to discriminate among possibilities, some of the bumps shrink to zero,
others attract support and grow. As things progress, we tend sometimes to find

wo ‘schools’ or hilltops, rarely of comparable size, or perhaps many hilltops,
with some growing and others fading. Ideally, over time, confident understanding
emerges, and appears as one tall, triumphant peak on an otherwise vacant
andscape.

In practice, this rarely happens. Pockets of aberrant opinion may hold out, with
oroponents either ignoring decisive evidence and experiments, or alternatively
inventing ever more baroque ways of modifying their views to accommodate such
facts. And, of course, such situations arise even more implacably if some fixed
ideological position commits an individual to a position, transcending any data.

In general, however, the historical landscape of any major scientific question
1as its own evolution, from pimply plurality, through contending hillocks, to a
single and narrowly-spiky mountain in maturity. It is important—although often
difficult—at each stage in the evolution of such a landscape to maintain a clear
sense of its geomorphology. Unfortunately, the media’s praiseworthy aim of always
oresenting a ‘balanced’ account can have difficulty tracking such an evolving
andscape. The temptation, whether in print, radio or TV, is to seek to present

he ‘two sides’, as if reporting a sporting event.
