For one thing, he did not even mention
this task explicitly in the introduction to the book. For another, he devoted just two pages to
discussing the consistency of his system in the body of the book. In fact, it is clear that Hilbert
did not intend to give a direct proof of consistency of geometry here, but even an indirect proof
of this fact does not explicitly appear in GdG, because a systematic treatment of the question
implied a full discussion of the structure of the system of real numbers, which was not included. Rather, Hilbert suggested that it would suffice to show that the specific kind of synthetic geometry
derivable from his axioms could be translated into the standard Cartesian geometry, if the axes
are taken as representing the entire field of real numbers. Only in the second edition of GdG,
published in 1903, Hilbert added an additional axiom, the so-called axiom of completeness
(Vollstindigkeitsaxiom), meant to ensure that, although infinitely many incomplete models satisfy
all the other axioms, there is only one complete model that satisfies this last axiom, namely the
usual Cartesian geometry.
