The results reveal substantial variability in the distribution of non-zero counts
within outer Clusters 1 and 2 (see figure 5c). The majority of counts in outer Cluster 1 are zero,
leaving little variation in the counts for the inner clustering. As most individuals present zero
counts (for most processes) at an inner cluster level, it becomes difficult to detect specific patterns
as it is also evident from the fact that many co-clustering probabilities are in the range 0.3-0.6

Figure 5. Posterior distribution of the number of inner clusters per outer cluster (a), relative frequency of the inner clusters
corresponding to the Binder estimate of the inner cluster allocation (b), cluster-specific empirical means of the counts (c). For outer Cluster 1, the latter is only shown for the four largest inner clusters for visualization purposes.
