T owe this series of 26 leaves from each of 100 trees to Miss AGNrs Fry. Of these
trees, 56 were hedge-row hollies, and 44 wood trees or bushes growing in moist
places.* The counting of the prickles was in some part undertaken by Mr, Macrxop,

* Miss Fry writes to me: “The texture of the leaves seems rather different,—the wood hollies are
much less stout and harsh and more often have few prickles. In fact, I rather wonder if shade does not
affect the number. In the few cases where hedge-row hollies have very few prickles the leaves come from
the inside of the bush. I have carefully avoided the neighbourhood of berries,—and what is more
difficult of flower buds.
