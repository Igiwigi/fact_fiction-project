In the animal body the greatest departure from a simple and regular figure is
caused in the vertebrate forms by the excrescence of the limbs. How does the
segmentation of the body behave in the region of the limbs? In the Frog it has been
shown above that the simple zonal character of the root-fields, although disturbed in
the hind limb, is not actually departed from and is still easy to perceive. “The
cutaneous field for each posterior root meets the middle line of the body both
ventrally and dorsally.” Each root-field sweeps down the limb and up again upon it,
so that the free apex of the limb is by this test about equidistant from the mid-
ventral and mid-dorsal lines; the digits are, in fact, so many points on the lateral
line of the body, as they were shown to be at the earlest origin in the embryo. The
most segmentally anterior portion of the skin of the hind-limb of the Frog is found to
occupy the extensor aspect (front) of the thigh. Next come the extensor and peroneal
aspects of the leg, then the dorsum pedis, the sole, the calf, and, finally, the most
segmentally posterior is the flexor aspect (back) of the thigh.
