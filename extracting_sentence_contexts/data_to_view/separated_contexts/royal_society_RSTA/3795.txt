lasers [50,58-64] (see figure 9), where both scalar and vector superpositions of OAM have
been reported (predominantly of a vector nature from waveguide solutions), and more recently
VECSEL lasers [65,66]. A major advance towards integrated OAM solutions was the demonstration of miniature
(micrometre-scale) optical vortex emitters on a silicon waveguide device, able to produce high
OAM into free-space beams with well-controlled amounts of OAM [67]. The team exploited the
fact that whispering gallery modes (WGMs) can carry high OAM, which they then extracted into
free-space emission by fabricating embedded angular grating structures into the WGM resonator
with a periodic modulation of refractive index in the azimuthal direction. An artistâ€™s impression of
this is shown in figure 10. Since this seminal work, several integrated sources have been proposed
and demonstrated [68-77].
