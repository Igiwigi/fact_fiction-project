the currents extend. In partly enclosed regions, however, it is frequently possible to
interpolate between the records made on opposite sides. A serious difficulty may
arise if the depth of the sea is very different at different points within it, for this
may destroy the possibility of interpolation, and therefore we must always examine
the soundings for any great variation. Ordinarily we should not expect much
variation in the velocities, for such places are intermediate in character between
narrow channels and the open shore, and therefore the currents in them may be
expected to show some increase in shallow water, but not so much as would be caused
by a proportional decrease in depth along a narrow bay or in approaching the open
shore. In shallow water also friction may, and often does, neutralize the magnifica-
tion that would occur in its absence.

One other fact may be noted. In shallow bays the difficulties of navigation
may be great, and navigators avoid them if possible by choosing a harbour
near the entrance. Thus observations of currents are most numerous about the
entrances, and often at the very places where the currents, and consequently the
dissipation, are greatest there are insuflicient observations to give a satisfactory
estimate.

Great care must be taken in dealing with observations among islands, straits, and
shoals. When the passage of a tidal current is obstructed by a shallow of small
horizontal extent, part of it goes round the shoal and part over the top. The
influence of this on the main current is of course small, but on the top of the shoal and
in its immediate neighbourhood the velocities may be much increased, for much the
same reason as accounts for the greater speed of a river where it is shallow. On the
