books. Actually, according to Stanley Gardiner (1903, p. 337), living specimens of Lithotrya
hang downwards with their appendages just projecting out of their tubes when their
entrances are covered by water.

The body inside the mantle is divided into two parts, which were named somewhat
unfortunately by Darwin (1851, p. 6) as the prosoma and the thorax. The prosoma is
described by Calman (1909, p. 113) as the cephalic region, while the thorax, which one
is tempted to call the abdomen, carries the six pairs of cirriform limbs. I am convinced
that the division between them is not an important morphological boundary such as, for
example, the boundary between the thorax and abdomen in Malacostraca. It represents
rather a functional boundary, for the constitution of the body wall differs in a functionally
critical manner on the two sides of the boundary. Also, according to Darwin (1851, p. 39)
the adductor muscle is included in the prosoma. This is most fortunate, as there is, in fact,
a very sharp division both functionally and structurally between the hinder margin of the
adductor muscle and the more posterior part of the prosoma (in Darwin’s sense). In my
description I shall use the term prosoma to exclude the adductor muscle, and I shall use
the non-committal term ‘trunk’ instead of thorax.

The prosoma bears on its upper surface a helmet-shaped armature of rigid chitin
(figures 4 and 5) which I call the oral cone. This whole structure is described and figured by
Darwin as the mouth. According to more modern nomenclature it includes an anterior
labrum which is fused round the sides of the oesophagus with the more posterior almost
non-existent hypostome. The rigid helmet so formed bears laterally and posteriorly the
mouthparts and at its apex the mouth.
