Lorenceau & Quéré [20] studied the movement of water droplets against gravity on a conical
wire and identified the Laplace pressure gradient as the decisive force. However, the wettability
of a surface may also play a role in the harvesting of dew on cactus spines and is something that
future research could explore. In fact, Luo [18] discussed the movement of fog droplets along
conical cactus spines and they developed a model to interpret the movement of barrel-shaped
droplets driven by liquid pressure differences within the drop. Even if the spine shapes are not
conical, all are tapered from their base to their tip, which could also drive surface droplets that
have formed on the spines from dew or fog to move from the area that has a lower cross-section
radius to the region of higher radius [21]. The results gained above justified further analysis of the movement of water on the spines
(using fluorescent labelled water) and within the stem of the plants (using MRI scans).

(b) Fluorescent nanoparticle imaging

Having captured time-lapse images of dew droplets on the surface of C. cinerea, which showed the
drops moving from the spine tips to the bases, this was further tested using fluorescent labelled
