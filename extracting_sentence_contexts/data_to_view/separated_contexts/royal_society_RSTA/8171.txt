It will be noted that in this list of elements no reference is made to the metal manganese. This, however, is because in all Farapay’s specimens there is an almost complete
absence of this metal, of such importance to the world generally to-day for the
production of industrial steels of all kinds. As a matter of fact, in these researches by Farapay, the metal manganese was never
even mentioned by him, though he was well aware of its existence, judging by his
paper* on the “ Separation of Manganese from Iron,” read before the Royal Institution
in 1819, and still later when he conclusively proved that manganese was a non-magnetic
metal, although this was some years later than the time when he was engaged on the
research on “ Steel and Alloys.” In a note ‘‘ On the General Magnetic Relations and
Characters of the Metals : Additional Facts,” dated February 7th, 1839, which appeared
in Farapay’s “ Experimental Researches in Electricity,” page 224, he said: “ A piece
of metallic manganese given to me by Mr. Evererr was very slightly magnetic and polar
at common temperatures. It was not more magnetic when cooled to the lowest degree.”
Farapay, with his keen analytical mind, soon found that these samples contained small
percentages of iron, so that riddle was soon solved.
