I now pass on to introduce the cumulative natalities for quinquennial groups of
years. As we have to deal here with greater masses, we find that even the rough
figures show a most remarkable regularity. Here we insert, also, those few proba-
bilities which we found scattered in the statistical publications of different countries.
By comparing these probabilities with those of Budapest, we have to take into

consideration the fact mentioned already, that these latter natalities ought to be
raised by about 8 per cent.

We add the following remarks referring to the table of quinquennial natalities :—

Sweden.—The first natalities were published for 1871 in the official publications on the movement
of the population in that year. For the period, 1871-80, Mr. V. Sunpnere published the results at
p. 150 of his ‘ Bidrag till Utverdrings frigen ’ (Upsala, 1885), whilst the natalities for 1881-90 are to be
found in the official publication for 1890 (vol. 1, p. 14 of the Appendix), and for 1891 in the ‘ Statistik
Tidskrift,’ part 100, p. 222 (Stockholm, 1894). The figures quoted below are taken from the
manuscript communication of Director Sinrnsiapx, and refer to the births of 1891 and the mean popu-
lation between December 31 of the year 1890 and 1891. The absolute figures are as follows:—
15-19 years, 2295 wives and 1189 legitimate births ; 20-24 years, 31,970 wives and 14,431 births;
