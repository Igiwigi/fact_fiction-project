Section IV—Application of the method of normal co-ordinates (numerical calculations)

Introduction and Summary.

1. Except in a few very simple cases, the equations which govern the motion of a
viscous fluid have so far defied analysis. Their difficulty comes mainly from the fact
that they are not linear, so that the principle of superposition cannot be employed,
as in many branches of mathematical physics, to construct solutions by the method
of series or of singularities. For the same reason the flow pattern in the neighbourhood
of a moving body must alter when the speed of the body is changed, and it follows that
any exact determination of the pattern will be restricted to some definite speed.

‘As a matter of fact, no precise determination of this kind exists, except in cases where
the motion is indefinitely slow. But the form of the equations gives no reason for
doubting the possibility of “ steady ” motion (in which the velocities are functions only
of position) in every case of flow past fixed and rigid boundaries. Now in experiment
it is found (unless the velocities are very small) that eddying or periodic motions
always occur. Thus the conclusion seems inevitable that a steady motion may
become unstable as the rate of flow is increased, in the sense that accidental
disturbances, if of suitable type, will persist.

2. The occurrence of eddies (or of “ turbulent ” motion) is intimately related with
the important problem of the resistance of fluids, and it is therefore not surprising that
the question of hydrodynamic stability has attracted much attention. Fairly obvious
lines of investigation are suggested by the cognate theory of elastic stability. Starting
