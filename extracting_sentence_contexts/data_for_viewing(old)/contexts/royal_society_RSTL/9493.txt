under pressure as the density diminished. (See Tables XIV. to XVIL. and diagram 1,
Plate 47.)

VII. The relation between the ultimate values of the times of transpiration for
different gases (air and hydrogen) for small densities ; the times are proportional to the
8quare roots of their atomic weights. (See Art. 42.)

VIII. The fact that the times of transpiration for the same gas in capillary tubes,
and at considerable densities, are inversely as the density and independent of the
temperature â€”MAxwWELL* and GRAHam.t

IX. The difference in the variation of the times of transpiration for different gases,
shown by the fact that the logarithmic curves for hydrogen cannot be made to fit those
for air. (Plates 47, 48, and 49.)

X. The approximation towards a constant value of the ratio which the thermal
differences of pres8ure bear to the mean pres8ure as the density diminishes, whatever
be the gas or plate, the ratio is that of the difference of the square roots of the
absolute temperatures to the square root of the absolute temperature.

XI. The approximation, as the density increases, to a linear relation between the
thermal differences of pressure and the reciprocal of the density.

XII. The difference between the law of variation of the thermal differences of
pressure for different gases, as shown by the non-agreement of the logarithmic
