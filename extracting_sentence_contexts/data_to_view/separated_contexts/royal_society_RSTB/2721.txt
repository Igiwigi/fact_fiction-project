There can be no doubt that species whose larvee are closely similar, are more easily
cross-fertilised than are widely different species, for example, Echinus eggs are almost
as readily fertilised by the spermatozoa of Strongylocentrotus as by their own ; the
converse cross is, however, much harder to effect, and indeed Strongylocentrotus eggs
seem difficult to fertilise with foreign sperm of any species. Some experiments were made to determine whether the gelatinous envelope has any
influence in preventing cross-fertilisation. That this may be the case is indicated by
the fact that eggs which have been shaken, so as at least partially to remove the
