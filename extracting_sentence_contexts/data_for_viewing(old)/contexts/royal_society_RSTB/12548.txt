ate methodological challenge: the composition of meaning is
governed by the syntactic structure of the expression, and the
steps of composing that structure are tightly—perhaps even
completely—intertwined and correlated with the semantic
combinatory steps. But if we want to understand meaning
composition in a mechanistic way, we must understand the
neurobiological relationship between syntactic and semantic
composition.
