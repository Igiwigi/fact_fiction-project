be assessed whether unstable damage evolution of a structural part would lead to failure of
the entire blade. The damage tolerance of specific material selections and alternative structural
designs could then be compared in the design phase.

4. Structural health monitoring

An SHM system’s main purpose is to give information about the presence of damage in an

accurate way, its location with a good resolution for possible repair/maintenance, the type of :2
damage (that in a complex structure like a wind turbine can be very diverse), the severity of the : =
damage and finally prognostic information about the remaining operating life [28]. [3

In fact, a great deal of sensor information is already available from offshore wind farms : =
concerning the wind conditions, power output, temperatures, gearbox /drive-train vibrations and DR
so on; but little or no sensor data specifically for the blades. As modern wind farms have a data : 3
handling and transfer framework already in place, an eventual monitoring suite for the blade : 3
condition can be designed to be a ‘module’ inside the already existing system. Furthermore, many : s
of these other sources will provide valuable parametric data to the blade sensor outputs. :§

The current maturity level for state-of-the-art blade damage sensing is very broad, with a ~

great deal of research at the material level on integration/embedding of promising sensors
into the composites. This includes fibre-optic sensors using fibre Bragg gratings [29] or
continuous optical fibre measurement [30], electrically conducting sensors based on conductive
polymers and carbon fibres [31], acoustic emission methods using piezoelectric transducer
