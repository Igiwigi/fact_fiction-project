As we shall see, the discrepancies between full-valence and truncated-
space correlation approaches are generally smaller for the singlet than the triplet states. This stems
from a higher multi-configurational character of the latter [141]. In fact, because the isomerization
process in the singlet PES occurs in a stepwise manner, reactants and products are somewhat
similar in nature, thus allowing for some error compensation in the ab initio calculations. The ORC path for interconversion of r-C4(tAg) and d-C,(!A’) is depicted in figure 14a. The
salient feature relates to the appearance of a small barrier at « = 151.5° in the CAS(8,12)/AVTZ
optimized curve.
