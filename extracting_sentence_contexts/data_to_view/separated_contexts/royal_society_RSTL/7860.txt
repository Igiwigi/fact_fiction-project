Many writers of great ability (French,
"Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, and English) have studied and explained the forces brought
nto action upon a ship by her own weight and stability, and by the action of the wind
upon her sails and of the waves upon her hull; and the result of their investigations
as been to encourage the construction of ships of such forms and such dispositions of
Heights as conduce to moderate and easy motions in the waves of the sea. The relative
positions of the centre of gravity and the metacentre, the excursions of the centres of
Spravity and buoyancy, the inclinations of the axis of rotation, and many other like
Huestions have been very fully and thoroughly discussed, especially by modern English
-Maval architects; in some cases, I yenture to say, with even more elaboration and minute-
'Mess of inquiry than their intrinsic importance demands. But while the means of
Securing ease and moderation of movement of the ship at sea have been thus elaborately
Studied, in order, mainly, as we have been told, to save the fabric of the ship and its
Hfastenings from excessive strains, comparatively few writers upon naval architecture have
â€”=pursued the subject to its legitimate and necessary development, by seeking to investigate
Sthe actual longitudinal bending- and shearing-strains to which the fabric is in fact exposed
bon ships of various forms under the yarious cireumstances to which every ship is liable. VZ But more than this: not only has the question of internal strain and strength in the
=ship been left undeveloped, but a serious fallacy has underlain many of the writings
