venous stasis, and thus the acute manifestations or seizures of apoplectiform or
epileptoid nature which the patients exhibit. We have, however, no direct evidence
of this, nor have we any evidence that the seizures may be due to the direct action of
poisonous products on the contraction of cerebral vessels.

We are almost driven to the conclusion that the toxic substance is not a single
body, for the only other poisonous material which we have succeeded in isolating,
namely choline, will not account for even the majority of the symptoms of the disease.
In the completeness with which we have been enabled to identify (both on chemical
and physiological grounds) choline in the cerebro-spinal fluid and blood of these
patients, we consider our work has been satisfactory only up to a certain point. As
affording a complete explanation of the pathology of the disease it has been a
disappointment ; we regard the fact that choline does exist in these fluids, as an
indication merely of the disintegration of the brain-tissue, and if the majority of
the symptoms are to be explained on the basis of auto-intoxication due to such
disintegration, we must confess that the other poisonous substances have eluded our
search : certainly glycero-phosphorie acid and lactic acid are not highly poisonous ;
their action is even less so than that of choline.

An apparently feeble circulation and fatty degeneration of the heart are very
frequent concomitants of the terminal stages of the disease, especially after a series of
epileptiform seizures, and the idea certainly seemed feasible at one point in our
research, that choline might explain these. A single dose of choline in a dog or cat
produces but little effect on the heart ; still, there is some effect, and it did not appear
