There is a trace in these figures of an effect such as Simpson and Scrase
suggested, i.e. the preponderance of duration of negative gradient in these storms was
slightly less when the storm centre was very close than when it was slightly more
distant. It must be noted, however, that the effect is only found here when the pre-
discharge gradient is rather small; when the gradient exceeds 5000 V/m. the pre-
ponderance of negative gradients is as high as ever when the storm centre is very close.

An attempt will now be made to sum up the facts which have definitely emerged
for this group of storms from the study of the pre-discharge gradient.

The pre-discharge potential gradient beneath a storm may have any value from
zero to 10,000 V/m. The latter value is occasionally but only rarely exceeded. Quite
small pre-discharge gradients (less than 1000 V/m.) are not uncommon even when the
storm centre is very close. The pre-discharge gradient may be of either sign up to any
distance from the storm at which it can be detected. When, however, the storm centre
is within 10 km. of the observer there is a definite preponderance of negative pre-
discharge gradients. When the distance of the storm centre is between 5 and 10 km.,
the duration of negative gradient is 1-5 times that of positive; when the distance is less
than 5 km. the corresponding ratio is 2-0, and when less than 8 km. 1-65, On the other
