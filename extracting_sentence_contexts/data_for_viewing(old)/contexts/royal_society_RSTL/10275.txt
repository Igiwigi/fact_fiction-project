increased temperature (not reaching pathological limits) of the blood carried to ib
would lead to a slowing of the beat of the Mammalian heart in correlation with
the diminished oxidations then occurring in the body generally, and its consequently
diminished nutritional demands.

There are still other reasons why the direct application to the Mammalian heart of
the results of experiments upon Frogs is unsatisfactory. It has been shown (4) that
the muscular tisswe of the Amphibian heart differs considerably in histological
characters from that of the Mammalian : with this difference in minute structure quite
important functional differences may be associated. Moreover, the Mammalian heart
is known to be far more under the control of extrinsic nerve centres than is that of
the Frog. Though the heart of the latter animal receives cardio-inhibitory fibres
through the vagus, their centre of origin is not usually in action, as shown by the fact
that cutting the vagi does not lead to pulse-quickening ; exactly the reverse and to a
very marked extent is the case in the Dog (se especially V. BezoLD) (5), and also in
Man as shown by the phenomena observed in cases of atropin poisoning. In addition,
the Mammalian heart receives from the cerebro-spinal centre accelerator nerve fibres,
and the existence of any such pulse-quickening fibres in connexion with the Frog's
