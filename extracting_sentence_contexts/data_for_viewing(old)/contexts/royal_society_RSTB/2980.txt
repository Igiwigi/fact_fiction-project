of nine bundles, withdrawn some distance from the periphery of the seed, and
‘2 connected together by the intermediate sack. In longitudinal sections the number
% of bundles cut of course depends upon the obliquity of the section (cf phot. 5,
ir
> phot. 9, and fig. 20).
= The true position of these bundles in the body of the seed is demonstrated by the
& section U. C. L., R. 7, b (fig. 29), where they are found in situ. The single bundle
a represented in this figure (v.b.) is still in continuity with the hypoderm (hy.), and
& is separated from the superficial palisade layer by about five layers of cells.
7 As the bundles approach the apex they pass outside the periphery of the plinth
3 and enter the canopy, one to each loculus (figs. 1, 23, and 30). That the bundles cling
very closely to the outside angle of the sinus (see phots. 6 and 9 and fig. 20) seems
& to be due to the fact that in this region, as in the body of the seed, they have
suffered a centripetal displacement. No section, however, has passed through our
hands in which the bundles at this height are seen lying in situ, though in the
specimen U. C. L., R. 6, ¢ (fig. 30, v.b.) their position is probably not far from that
which they occupied in the living seed. That a single bundle normally entered each
of the nine loculi of the canopy is shown by almost every section through this part
of the seed (figs. 1, 20, 23, 25), though the bundles are not always preserved,
especially in the distal parts of the loculi.

The form of the chalazal bundle in transverse section is roughly circular with
dimensions for the xylem strand of 84 x 70m; the peripheral bundles, on the other
hand, have an elliptical section (W. 1915, O., phot. 14), with average dimensions at
