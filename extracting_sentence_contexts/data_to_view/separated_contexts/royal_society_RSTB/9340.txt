Experts are incapable of expres-
sing themselves (orally or in writing) in a manner
comprehensible to non-specialists.

(11) Lax (‘liberal’) admissibility standards. Courts too readily
admit questionable scientific evidence at trial, thus
exposing fact-finders to exaggerated risks of adjudica-
tive error.

(12) Excessively demanding (‘conservative’) admissibility standards. Courts too readily exclude novel or unconventional expert
opinions, thus depriving fact-finders of information
relevant to their decision-making.

(13) Testimonial silencing. Trial procedures for eliciting oral
testimony prevent expert witnesses from communicat-
ing their evidence in their own language and on their
own terms.

(14) Adversarial deficit. There is inadequate scientific
support for the defence throughout the pre-trial and/
or trial process.

(15) Manufactured disagreement.
