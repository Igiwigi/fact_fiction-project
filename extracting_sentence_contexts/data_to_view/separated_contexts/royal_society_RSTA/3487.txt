The interval | is partitioned into n +1 closed intervals with boundaries
at the observed points {x;}'!_,. Each of these intervals is assigned a random weight W;, drawn
from a Dirichlet distribution. Note that this Dirichlet distribution with n+ 1 unit parameters
is in fact the uniform distribution on the unit simplex A”, as can be seen from equations (3.1)
and (3.2). Realizations of the posterior distribution Ff (figure 2b) have a natural interpretation in the
DS theory of belief functions [11]: a probability mass Wj is assigned to the elementary events
[x@-1),x(], from which a belief function on IC R can be constructed. This assignment is inherently
‘imprecise’ in the following sense.
