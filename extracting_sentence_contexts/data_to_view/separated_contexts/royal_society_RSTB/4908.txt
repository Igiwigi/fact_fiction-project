The outer one is less distinct and double along the
left side, but still evident. When examined under a high power it is seen to be more
like a root annual ring, 7.e., the change is abrupt on both sides. In fact, false annual
rings may take on a variety of form. Part of one that may be termed the “ inverse ”
type is shown at a higher magnification in Photo. 29.* Here, if the lower tissues were
cut away, it would be almost impossible to tell the true from the false, or to know,
except by the inclination of the rays, in what direction the cambium lies. Its resin
canals are just beyond the upper limits of the field of the photograph in the diffuse
portion of the ring.
