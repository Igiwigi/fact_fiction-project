while calculating the starting field to five cells per wavelength, followed by linear interpolation.
Part of a Hanning window was used to gradually allow the pressure to go to zero towards the
top of the calculation domain in order to prevent spurious reflections. Analysis is performed in
octave bands. Twenty sound frequencies were individually simulated with the hybrid analyticalâ€”
CM-GFPE model to constitute each band.

Numerical results depicted in figure 8 show a rather complex sound pressure level distribution
along the valley. In both ground type scenarios, significant shielding is observed directly near
the source side of the valley. However, strong differences are predicted further across the valley.
Starting from about the centre of the valley, near-free-field sound propagation is predicted at
all octave bands for the rigid ground, while there is a much stronger reduction along the
grass-covered valley. Effects become increasingly pronounced with increasing sound frequency,
consistent with the fact that surface impedance decreases with frequency. These numerical
simulations indicate the importance of ground type in the case of ridge wind turbines emitting
sound into a valley. This behaviour deviates from wind turbine sound propagation above flat
ground, where the effects of ground type are typically much less pronounced [36].

An estimation of the total wind turbine received sound pressure level is shown in figure 9,
for both ground types. A (relative) spectrum is considered to allow balancing the importance of
the different octave bands, as they behave quite differently during propagation across the valley.
To perform this analysis, the mean over a large set of spectral source power level measurements
near large horizontal-axis wind turbines with a power production of more than 2 MW, as reported
in [15], is used. This spectrum is repeated in appendix B.
