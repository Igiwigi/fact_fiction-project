the two shadows were made equally luminous by rotating B. The number of degrees
from the zero point was then noted. The sectors then were set so that half the
light of the reflected beam was cut off, and equality of illumination of the shadows
again secured by rotating B. The number of degrees was again noted. When the
sectors were set at 45° the same procedure was adopted. If the coefficient of
absorption (obstruction) did not vary, the intervals between first and second readings
and between the second and third should be the same. By again setting the angle
of the sectors to give one-eighth part of the light, another reading could be obtained,
and so on. By altering the angle of M’ a new set of readings could be obtained, till
every part of the annulus had been tested. By altering the position of the slit, 8, in
the spectrum, the obstruction coefficient for any colour could be arrived at. It will
be seen that by this method one beam of light alone is utilized in a very simple
method, and is in fact a modification of the method adopted when graduating wedges
in white light, as described in the monthly notices of the Royal Astronomical Society
four years ago, From the extreme red to beyond G no difference was found in the
“ obstruction” coefficients above that which would arise from pure error in observa-
tion. The following is the adopted coefficient for the annulus mostly employed :-—

TasLE I.—Scale of Wedge, the coefficient being 0086 for each degree.
