Physics and the 1900 list of problems

In the introductory section of his Paris talk, Hilbert stressed the important role he accorded
to empirical motivations as a fundamental source of nourishment for what he described as a
‘living organism’, in which mathematics and the physical sciences appear tightly interrelated. The empirical motivations underlying mathematical ideas, Hilbert said, should by no means be
taken as opposed to rigour. On the contrary, contrasting an ‘opinion occasionally advocated by
eminent men’, Hilbert insisted that the contemporary quest for rigor in analysis and arithmetic
should, in fact, be extended to both geometry and the physical sciences. He was alluding here, most
probably, to Kronecker and Weierstrass, and the Berlin purist tendencies that kept geometry
and applications out of their scope of interest. Rigorous methods are often simpler and easier
to understand, Hilbert said, and, therefore, a more rigorous treatment would only perfect our
understanding of these topics, and at the same time would provide mathematics with ever new
and fruitful ideas.
