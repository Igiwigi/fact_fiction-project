It will be seen that the results are uniformly in agreement with a molecular origin for
the secondary lines, the half-widths found being very close to the values calculated for
the molecule. In the case of the Helium line the fact that the half-width found is
slightly greater than the calculated value is perhaps to be explained in part by the
conservative estimate of the temperature in the case of the Helium tube, but it is
believed that the limiting theoretical widths of the lines are more nearly attained in
the tubes with wide capillaries and in which the current density is consequently lower,
than in the tubes with narrow capillaries of the conventional Plucker form. The lines
426018 and 6225 are both “ Fulcher” lines, are enhanced at low pressures, and are
weakened by the condensed discharge. Neither of them shows the Zeeman effect. The
line 26028 belongs to an entirely different class, being a high-pressure line which shows
the Zeeman effect. Since these are the two most important classes of lines it is probable
that the whole of the secondary spectrum is due to the Hydrogen molecule.
