Around the latter village are beds of limestone breccia composed mainly of fragments

of the Kao-liang limestones. Of the age of this breccia we obtained no conclusive
information. Similar breccias have doubtless been formed in the country at various
times ; but the breccia at Taio-cho-shui may be part of the sheet which occurs five miles
to the N. around the village of Ta-pan-ching, where it underlies the red shales. If so,
both outcrops of limestone breccia are pre-Devonian and belong to the Kao-liang Series.

The gorge of the Ta-pan-ching River presents a very instructive section, of which the
facts recorded in our note books during our hasty traverse of the gorge indicate the
following incomplete sequence. The rocks have been thrown into a series of folds and
have also been traversed by faults, and in one place by a small thrust-plane. The
predominant strike of the rocks is from 330° to 340°, so that the grain of this block of
hills, of which the western front here trends N. and §., is cut across obliquely by the
Salween valley ; heace the Salween valley, like that of the Shweli, is bounded on the
KE. by a dissected fault scarp. After leaving Taio-cho-shui the Kao-liang limestones
and limestone breccia extend up the valley for a short distance; at the bridge by
which the road crosses to the eastern bank of the river they have disappeared beneath
buff to gray sandstones, which are seen at intervals in the ascent of the gorge.

The sandstones are succeeded by black shales with an interbedded bluish limestone
with irregular calcite veins. In the second outcrop of this limestone we saw some
