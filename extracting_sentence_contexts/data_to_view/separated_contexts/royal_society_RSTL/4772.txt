6th, It
also follows immediately (assuming it as a fact very probable, but still to be proved,
that the deepest part of the glacier moves slower than the surface) that the frontal
dip of the stractural planes of all glaciers diminishes towards their inferior extremity,
where it approaches zero, or even inclines outwards, since then the whole pressure of
the semi-fluid mass is unsustained by any barrier, and the velocity varies (probably
in a rapid progression) with the distance from the s0il ; whilst nearer the origin of the
glacier the frontal dip is great, because the mass of the glacier forms a virtual barrier
in advance, and the structure is comparatively indistinct, for the same reason that
the transverse structure is indistinet, viz, that the neighbouring horizontal prisms of
ice move with nearly a common velocity. 7th. Where two glaciers unite, it is a fact
that the structure immediately becomes more developed. This arises from the in-
creased velocity, as well as friction of each due to lateral compression. 8th.
