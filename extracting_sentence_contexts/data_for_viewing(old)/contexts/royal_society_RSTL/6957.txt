stations, particularly if they were judiciously selected, the geographical localities in which
the greater part at least of the disturbances originated, might be approximately traced.
Confining ourselves, for brevity, to the illustration afforded by a single element, viz. the
Declination, it was found that at all stations, in all parts of the globe, the disturbances
of the declination resolved themselves into two distinct and dissimilar categories ; the same
two distinct and dissimilar forms of diurnal progression being everywhere reproduced
with little other variation than that of the particular hours of maxima and minima ; but
having this additional important peculiarity, that the particular form of the curve of
the diurnal progression which characterized the Easterly Deflection at certain stations
marked the Westerly Deflection at certain other stations, and vice vers. It was also
found that at some stations the Easterly Deflections greatly preponderated over the
Westerly, whilst at other stations the Westerly were predominant. An attentive con-
8ideration of the facts elicited by this extensive though somewhat laborious investiga-
tion strengthened the previously prevailing impression, that the progressive increase of
our knowledge of these remarkable phenomena would lead, in both hemispheres, to
the establishment of a connexion—if not to the identification—of the terrestrial sources
of the casual and transitory disturbances with the foci, as they are sometimes called, of
the two magnetic systems of the globe.

. Proceeding from these premises, it appeared desirable to examine whether, if two

stations were taken in a sitable and nearly similar latitude, one of which might be on

the eastern and the other on the western side of one of the supposed points of terrestrial
