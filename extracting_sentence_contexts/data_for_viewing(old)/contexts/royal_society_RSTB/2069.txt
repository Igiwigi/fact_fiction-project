reasonably suppose, then, that Rachiopteris Williamsoni was the petiole of some
unknown Medullosean stem.

If we now compare the organization of our Medullosa with that of the species
previously known, we find that the essential difference consists in the fact that in
M. anglica the few steles are similar to one another, while in the other species they
are differentiated into a central and a peripheral system.* Polystely together with
secondary thickening is a somewhat unpractical combination, which could never have
reached any high development in the crude form in which it exists in Medullosa anglica.
The steles, as they grew in thickness on all sides, must ultimately have got in one
another’s way. The structure, as shown in all the specimens investigated, is, in
fact, not adapted to the attainment of arboreal habit. The difficulty is met in the
four species, M. stellata, Corra; M. porosa, Corra; M. Solmsii, Scuenk; and
M. Leuckarti, Gorr. et Srenz., by the differentiation of a distinct system of peripheral
steles forming a circle round the stem.{ It was on the free outer side of these steles,
where the space for new growth was unrestricted, that the chief formation of
secondary wood and bast took place; on the inner side of the peripheral ring, and
