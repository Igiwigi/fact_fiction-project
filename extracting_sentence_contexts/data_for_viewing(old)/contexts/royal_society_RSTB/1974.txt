way, but it possibly represented an embryo arrested in an early stage of development.

The observations described above establish the possibility of inducing apogamy in
Athyrium Filix-femina; this was previously highly probable from an observation
recorded by Mr. Drurry* on an aposporously-produced prothallus of the variety,
but in that isolated case the structure was not investigated,

Polypodium vulgare, var. grandiceps.

This culture had a characteristic aspect from the deep green colour of its prothalli,
the thin margins of which became thrown into folds. From the under surface thick
reddish brown rhizoids were produced, The numerous archegonia had their necks
almost always closed, a fact which points to the successful exclusion of fluid water.
Only one or two normally-produced plants originated in the pot, and with these
exceptions the prothalli were grown for eighteen months before any noteworthy
change occurred. About this time (June, 1897), gametophytie budding was noticed.
This took place sometimes from the margin, at other times from the under surface.
When in the latter position it resulted in the appearance on the mid-rib, or more
commonly just within the margin, of filamentous growths, which soon widened into
prothalli of spathulate outline. This profuse gametophyte budding stands in direct
relation tu the apogamous development of sporophytes, the first examples of which
were noticed at the same time; numerous instances occurred in the six months
following.

Sometimes the bud forms as a continuation of the prothallus apex (fig. 74). In
