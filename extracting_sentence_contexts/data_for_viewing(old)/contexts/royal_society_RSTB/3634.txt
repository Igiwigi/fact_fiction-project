On prolonged treatment with alcohol these granules become disintegrated, and to a
large extent dissolved. On examining the chlorogogenous tissue of specimens which
had been kept in aleohol (80-90 per cent.) for two years, the chlorogogen cells are
found to contain no yellow granules, such as are seen in the fresh tissue, but instead
they contain some minute colourless granules which are either the remains of the
large granules or, more probably, the ordinary cytoplasmic granules ; the chlorogogen
granules have largely or totally disappeared. A similar effect can be brought about
in a shorter time by keeping sections of the chlorogogenous tissue in absolute alcohol
or in a mixture of absolute alcohol and ether maintained at 55Â°C. After three days
of such treatment with warm absolute alcohol the granules are paler in colour than
when fresh ; many are still yellow, but others are colourless or almost so. On the
fourth day the granules exhibit a tendency to break up; some of them are, in fact,
falling to pieces. Those granules which retain the yellow colour seem to be more
resistant to disintegration than the colourless ones. After eleven days in warm

* The chlorogogenous tissue of Halla is not available in sufficient quantity to enable me to test, with
much hope of a definite result, for the presence of urate of sodium, and I have not attempted to do so.
