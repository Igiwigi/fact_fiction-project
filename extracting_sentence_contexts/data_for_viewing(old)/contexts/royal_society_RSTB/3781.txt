condensing filaments have been shown to become richer in their percentage of this
acid as they approach the characteristic shapes of the metaphase figure. It is
difficult to believe that the chromatin exists at the expense of the cytoplasm, and
that the latter conversely exists at the expense of the former, and, since the
chromatin remains constant in volume, whereas the cytoplasm varies, we must
assume that the first is the important substance, and that the second is purely
nutritive. It may be argued that the cytoplasm is not a homogeneous compound,
and that it contains substances that furnish reserve material both for itself and the
chromatin, for we know that a close relationship exists between the two and that
an exchange of material constantly occurs between them; this, however, cannot
affect McCiuneâ€™s suggestion that the chromosomes put forward their common
energies to construct a new cytoplasm, and I find it impossible to reconcile this view
with the facts now before us.

The explanation of the growth period as a means of counteracting the loss of
chromatin entailed by mitosis must therefore be accepted as true, and the view of
JANSSENS is proved in entirety. If the dissociation of chromosomes into minute
granules occurs for the purpose of offering a greater surface for nutrition, we must
conclude that the same reason governs dissociation in all resting stages. The
secondary spermatocyte mitosis is the only division not preceded by a resting stage,
and consequently no increase of chromatin volume takes place ; it is at this division
that reduction occurs by which the somatic amount is halved, and the mature
spermatozoon thus carries a volume that combines with the chromatin of the ovum
to form once more the amount constant for the species.
