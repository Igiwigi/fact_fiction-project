The most widely spread species of the Australian Araucarias is A. Cunninghami (C),
which extends over an area 900 miles long in New South Wales and Queensland ;
this type is stated to occur also at an altitude of 6000 feet and upwards on Mount
Obree, and at an altitude of 3000-4000 feet on Mount Arfak, in New Guinea.t The
Norfolk Island pine, Avaucaria excelsa (E), takes its name from the island where it
was discovered by Captain Cook, and MvELLER records this species from New South
Wales. Araucaria Cookii occurs in the New Caledonian Archipelago and in the
New Hebrides. Araucaria Balanse is recorded by Broneniart’ and Gris§ from
a height of 500 metres in New Caledonia, the home also of A, Muelleri and
A, Montana,

One of the most remarkable facts as regards the distribution of Araucaria is the
occurrence in New Caledonia of no less than five species of the genus.

The generic name Dammara, taken from Dammar-Puti, applied by islanders to
the hard resin obtained from the tree, was first used by Rumputos|| in a description
of a plant from Amboyna, one of the Moluccas, which he named Dammara alba.
In 1803 Lampert’ figured and described as Pinus Dammara specimens of the same
tree sent from Amboyna to Sir JosepH Banks, and at a later date he adopted the
name Dammara orientalis,**

In 1807 Sanissurytt proposed the name Agathis in place of Dammara. Both
