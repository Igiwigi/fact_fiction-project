Some of the remarks which we haye made with regard to the influence of a supply of
combined Nitrogen upon the growth of the Graminaceze, apply also, in a greater or
less degree, to the other plants experimented npon.. We shall not comment here in
detail upon the value of each experiment, but simply call attention to the columns of
Nitrogen, in the Tables, and to the notes in the Appendix indicating the

gain or loss of
cireumstances of growth of the plants.

With regard to the Leguminose experimented upon, it is to be observed that the
development was by no means 80 satisfactory as in the case of the Graminacee. Hence
the evidence which the results relating to them afford against the fact of assimilation
of free Nitrogen must be admitted to apply to a more limited range of conditions of
growth, and, therefore, to be less conclusive against the possibility of such assimilaÂ»
tion. Still, so far as they go, the results with these plants, and also those with bucks
wheat, tend to confirm those obtained under the more favourable cireumstances of
growth with the cereals. It will be remembered, however, that M. BoUsSINGAULT expes
rimented with a great many Leguminous plants, and generally succeeded in getting
much more healthy growth than we were able to do in the cases to which the figures in
the Tables refer. Yet in no case did he find any such gain of Nitrogen as to lead him
to the conclusion that these plants, any more than the Graminacez, assimilated free or
uncombined Nitrogen. Our own experiments with Leguminous plants are, however,
not yet concluded; 80 that we hope to supply some additional evidence on this subject,
