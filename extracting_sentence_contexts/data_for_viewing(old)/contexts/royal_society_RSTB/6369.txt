In the mammal we have typically a first set of teeth comprising incisors, a canine,
and four molars. These are shed and replaced by a second set which consist of
incisors, a canine, four replacing molars and three further molars which have no
antecedents. In some Cynodonts we have a succession of teeth almost typically
mammalian. Certainly a number of anterior molars are replaced. In the Gorgonop-
sians we have a dental succession in the incisors and the canine, but apparently not
in the molars. In the Therocephalians we have certainly a dental succession in
the incisors and canines. Whether there are more than two sets is at present
unknown. As the succession in the incisors seems to be irregular, it seems probable
that there is an indefinite succession of the incisors. But it seems possible that there
are only two sets of canines. And so far as the evidence goes there is no satisfactory
proof of a dental succession in the molars. The fact that in Hofmeyria the molars are
not all equally developed suggests that in this later Therocephalian there may be a
dental succession. In the Whaitsidae it is probable that there is a set of molar teeth
that became lost later on and are not replaced. In the only known skull, Lycideops
longiceps, which is certainly immature, there is a series of small molars which will
probably be shed, and possibly not replaced.
