well obeyed by the other gases, that there is large and unexplained discrepancy between the values
found for the relative conductivity of hydrogen under RÃ©ntgen rays by J. J. THoMSON and PERRIN
respectively, although their determinations agree fairly well in most other cases,


OF GASES UNDER THE BECQUEREL RAYS. 525 In the first place, it will be seen that all the compounds examined gave very
nearly the same values for the relative conductivities, There is, in fact, no clear
evidence of any difference between them in this respect. This result naturally
suggests the conclusion that all these substances give absorbable rays of the same
physical nature. Secondly, it will be seen that the non-deflectable rays give some-
what different results from the deflectable ones; these differences being well outside
the errors of experiment.
