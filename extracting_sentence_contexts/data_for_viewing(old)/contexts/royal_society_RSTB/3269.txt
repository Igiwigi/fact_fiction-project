shorter stems may show. A similar stem was so arranged with a water valve that
the mercury could not be raised above 25 centims., and in this case although no air
was drawn back from the stem for over two hours, the leaves were drooping
slightly at the end of the first hour (23° C. and sunny), and strongly at the end of
the second hour.

When a water-filled manometer is attached to a cut branch so that continuity
exists between the external water and that in the charged vessels, the latter draw
in water until a sufficient tension is reached to draw air out of the air-containing
vessels and the air spaces.

Hence, the manometric pressure does not necessarily measure the negative pressure
in either set of vessels, but something between them. The fact that air is drawn
back shows that in the stem it exists under a higher pressure than in the manometer,
and still higher than in the actively absorbing vessels, A much smaller pressure will
draw air readily from a cut surface than will drive it freely through the saturated
walls of intact vessels. Hence, an attempt was made to demonstrate the actual
pressures in the vessels of a transpiring stem when these are uninjured and
functioning.

A. lateral two-year-old branch near the base of a large Wistaria was cut under
water, and a glass Y-tube filled with water attached. The clamped rubber ends
were then attached to two glass receivers, one containing a strong almost black
