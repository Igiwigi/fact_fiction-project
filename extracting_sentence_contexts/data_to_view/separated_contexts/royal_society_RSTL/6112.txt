We may with these five points form in all (4.1.2.3.4=)12 pentagons, and
the symbol 12345 of any pentagon may of course be read backwards or forwards from
any point (12345=23451=&ec.=15432=&.) without alteration of its meaning. Now
attaching to each arrangement of the five numbers a sign, + or —, according to the
ordinary rule of signs, 12345 being as usual positive, the arrangements 12345, 23451,
&. .. 15432, &c., which belong to the same pentagon, have all of them the same sign ;
and we may consequently connect with each pentagon the sign + or — ; there are, in
fact, six pentagons with the 8ign + and six with the sign — ; and to each positive
pentagon there corresponds a negative pentagon, which is derived from it by stellation,
viz. to the positive pentagon 12345 there corresponds the negative one 24135, and 80
EW the other positive pentagons. The above-mentioned system of equations

A

2 $,=12345—24135, 6,=21435—13245,
Z 0,=13425—32145, $,=31245—14325,
= ©,=14235—43125, 9,=41325—12435,

A fact exhibits the six positive pentagons, each accompanied by its stellated negative
Yentagon, and the formation of the system of equations is thus completely explained ;
He order of arrangement of the pairs inter se (or, what comes to the same thing, the
=#rder of arrangement of the suffixes of the 9's) is wholly immaterial.

= 10. The six pairs of pentagons, or, what is the same thing, the g's, correspond to each
ther in pairs in a fivefold manner, quoad the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively ; thus,
Buoad 5, the pairs are @, and @,, @, and @,, ©, and @, or 8ay 1 and 4, 2 and 5, 3 and 6. She relation is best seen by means of the positive pentagons; thus, guoad 5, in the
Hentagons 12345 and 21435, the points adjacent to 5 in the one of them are the points
Z, 3, and in the other of them the complementary points 1, 4; and s0 in the other cases.
he fivefold correspondence is shown by the symbolical equations

E 1=16, 24, 35,
S 2=12, 34, 56,
5 3=15, 23, 46,
E 4=13, 26, 36,

5=14, 25, 36,

which, in fact, indicate the combinations of the 9's which correspond to the several roots
of the quintic.
