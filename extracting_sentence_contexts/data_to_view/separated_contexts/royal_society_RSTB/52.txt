For practical purposes, therefore, it may be taken that when a
control-HxrssE-tube, such as I have employed, yields practically no colonies the result
by Haessr’s method is accurate, but that when such a tube yields a considerable
number of colonies the result is too high. The fact that the flask method and Hesssr’s method yield practically coincident
results when the latter (Hxssn’s) is employed under circumstances in which it is
reliable (i.e., in calm air) gives a clear and unmistakable answer to the question, which
I have already referred to, as to whether the suspended organisms in the air exist
there in an isolated condition, or in aggregates of greater or less magnitude. The coincidence between the results obtained by these two methods is only
explicable, in fact, on the supposition that the aérial micro-organisms are present as
isolated individuals, for, were they present in aggregates, the results yielded by the
flask-method would be in excess; and if the magnitude of the aggregates was great,
in enormous excess of those obtained by Hussr’s method, as in the process of
agitation with the liquid gelatine to which they are subjected in the flask-method,
these aggregates would necessarily become broken up into lesser aggregates, at any
rate, if not into the ultimate individuals of which they are composed. Hesse, in his well-known paper “Ueber quantitative Bestimmung der in der Luft
enthaltenen Mikroorganismen” (‘ Mittheilungen a, d. Kaiserl. Gesundheitsamte,’
vol. 2, 1884, p. 187), draws the following conclusion with regard to this point :—
“The conspicuous fact that the extreme colonies formed in the tube are moulds
indicates that the mould-germs present in the air are on the average lighter than the
bacterial germs, and leads to the conclusion that the aérial bacteria are not present
as isolated individuals, but as aggregates of individuals or adhering to carriers in
such a manner that on the average they weigh heavier than the mould-germs.”
