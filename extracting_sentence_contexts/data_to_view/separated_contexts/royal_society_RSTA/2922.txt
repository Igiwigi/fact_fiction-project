The conclusion from this lengthy argumentation is that the assumption \61| < || is
contradictory for (the perfectly viable) ICs of localization. Consequently, it is either that |6,| =
O(|62|) or that |6;| >>> (in the initial localization regime). After that fact is established, one
observes that, for the case |61| < |6.l, clearly one has (sin? A1(t))e, = 3 Furthermore, as the
averaging with respect to @2 can always be done not on one but on several of the first fast (second
mass impact) cycles, clearly for the case \61| = (1621/2), one would also have (sin? A(6))e, = 3 A
typical example is |61| = |(62|/2), for which even for one cycle (sin? 6) ())a = 3 (due to the square).
