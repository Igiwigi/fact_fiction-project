almost every one of the main groups of Mammals has representatives of two or more
of these four chief types ; in other words, some of the genera, and even species, have
remained at a lower level than that which has been reached by others. This shows
plainly that the vascularisation of the retina by special vessels has not been inherited
by Mammals as a class, but that it has been developed independently in the various
main groups. This is well exemplified by that large assembly of Ungulata in the
widest sense, beginning with Elephas and Hyrax and the Perissodactyls, and ending
with the Ruminants, which are the most highly developed of all the Ungulata. The
Marsupials and the Rodents show a similar parallelism.

We see clearly that the special retinal vascularisation begins with many minute
and short vessels which enter upon the inner surface of the retina in the periphery of
the disc ; they are, in fact, continuations of the vessels of the sheaths of the optic
nerve. Whilst these new vessels increase in size and numbers, they assume a more
and more central position, becoming more deeply embedded within the nerve and its
dise, until some of them appear as typical central vessels, and their more outward
companions disappear from the surface.

Some animals, e.g., the Cervide, have multiple dises with a central vessel for each ;
and in most of the Sciuromorpha, which have an enormously elongated dise, an
mmense number of large trunk vessels emanate in parallel lines like the teeth of a comb.

The manner in which the retinal vessels enter the eye has been studied by Vosstus,
and the manner in which the larger arteries spread out from the disc to join the veins,
and their course, has been described by LANGENBACHER in Man, the Cow, Deer, Goat,
