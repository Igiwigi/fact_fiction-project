% From Mr. Last’s correspondence it appears that the bones from the marsh of
= Amboulisatra were found lying between a stratum of a “white clayey substance”
© above, and a deposit of “greenish sand and stones” below. The white clay has a
thickness of 18 inches to 2 feet, and is overlaid by 6 inches of black soil. The matrix
3 adhering to the bones is in fact a green quartzitic sand. They have a very fresh
- appearance, and in their mode of preservation and colouring much resemble the
animal remains from lake-dwellings, some of them having an even fresher
A appearance. With regard to the remains of Crocodilus robustus from the marsh of Amboulisatra,
it has already been stated that this species is actually existing in the lakes of the
interior.
