The pumping ont and
refilling with hydrogen should now be repeated, observing the logarithmic decrement
each time, until ib is found that it no longer decreases in value ; when this is the
case accurate observations are commenced. 688. It has been found that hydrogen has much less viscosity than any other gas ;
the fact of the logarithmic decrement not decreasing by additional attempts at
purification is the test of its being free from admixture. This method of ascertaining
the purity of the gas, by the uniformity of its viscosity coefficient ab 760 millims., is
more accurate than collecting samples and analysing them eudiometrically (706). Several series of observations in hydrogen have been taken.
