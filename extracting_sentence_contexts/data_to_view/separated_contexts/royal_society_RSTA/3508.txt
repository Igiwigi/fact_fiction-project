A large dispersion could be found on the same sample. A lower average value of approximately
8nm for the NiO(111) single-crystal domain size was derived from GIXD data obtained on
passivated Ni(111) surfaces [27,30]. This difference can be assigned to the fact that STM and AFM
measurements are unable to resolve the multiple twin or subgrain boundaries that may exist in
the passive film if they do not markedly emerge at the topmost surface of the film. The grain boundaries separating the oxide grains play a key role in the breakdown of passivity
and the initiation of localized corrosion as revealed by STM and AFM studies performed on
well-defined substrate surfaces [58-62]. These nanostructure defects act as preferential sites for
passivity breakdown and pit initiation both without and with aggressive anions (Cl~) present in
the electrolyte.
