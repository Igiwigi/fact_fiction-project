muscle begins to be conyulsed, the needle is deflected through the zero-point, and is
seen to oscillate on the negative side of the zero, until the contracting power of the
muscle is exhausted, which always happens before the needle has had time to come to
rest*,” This fact, which M. Du Bois REYMOXND has analysed with much care, is inter-
preted by him in the following manner, which, for the sake of greater exactitude, we
give in the words of the above-cited abstract, which are in accordance with the opinion
repeatedly expressed by the author himself in his original workf:—* At first it might
be supposed that this showed a current during the tetanus in a direction contrary to that
during rest ; but this is not the case. Before the tetanus begins, the secondary polarity
is eyolved on the platinum plates in the conducting vessel. This polarity tends to pro-
duce a current in the opposite direction to the muscular current.
