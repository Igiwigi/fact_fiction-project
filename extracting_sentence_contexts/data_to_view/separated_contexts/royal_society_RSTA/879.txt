The city is
located at the mouth of the River Lee, which flows west to east through the city, dividing in two
to the west of the city centre, merging again to the east of the city as it flows out to sea. Much
of the city centre is low-lying and exposed to both fluvial and tidal flooding events. In fact, the
Irish (Gaelic) name for Cork is Corcaigh, meaning bog or marsh. Early maps of the city from the
sixteenth century show large parts of what is now the city centre marked as ‘Marsh’ or ‘Marshes’
(figure 3). Cork has experienced frequent flooding throughout its history; some 292 floods were reported
over the period 1841-1988 [64].
