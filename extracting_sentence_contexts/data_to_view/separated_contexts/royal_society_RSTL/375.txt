On the cause of the colours with which the images are
affected. As there are some specimens of calcareous spar in which the
multiplication of the images is not accompanied with the pro-
duction of colours, the one phenomenon is not necessarily con-
nected with the other, the multiplication of the images depend-
ing merely on the interruption in the regular structure'of the
mineral, and the colours upon the thickness and erystalline
nature of the vein by which that interruption is produced. We have already seen that the double image Ab (Fig. s.)
is in-general white, while a, and B, are affected with the same
prismatic colour, and that when Ab is coloured at particular
angles of -incidence, its colour'is always complementary to

formed.
