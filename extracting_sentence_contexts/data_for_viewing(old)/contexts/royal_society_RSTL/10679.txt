it is entirely negative between crossed nicols. The empty spicular cavities, to which
the porous nature of the rock is due, appear in fractured surfaces as very minute,
short, straight tubes or open canals from *15 to *4 mm. in length by -03 mm. in width.
They are undoubtedly the casts of acerate and brifid siliceous spicules, and they are
sufficiently numerous to show that the silica derived from the solution of the contained
spicules can have produced the colloid material of which the rock principally consists.
There can be no doubt that this malm rock is derived from the spicules of siliceous
8ponges.

Messrs. Way and Paixe first called attention to the fact that the Farnbam malm
and firestone contain a large amount, varying from 25 to 75 per cent., of soluble
silica, but they do not appear to have noticed the peculiar globular form in which the
silica has been deposited, and* they deny its organic origin.

Selborne, Hampshire.â€” The malm rock is well shown in the quarries at this village,
where a section of 15 feet (4:5 m.) is exposed ; also in road-cuttings and on the
surfaces of the adjoining fields. Tt is of a much harder and more compact character
than that at Farnham, and contains a fair proportion of calcite, which renders it more
Suitable as building material. Spicules and spicular casts abound in it. Some of the
casts of spicules in the more calcareous beds have been refilled with crystalline calcite,
whilst in sections of the more siliceous beds the spicules are seen thickly grouped
together, surrounded by globular silica and also by transparent chalcedonic silica.
