For the most contaminated alloys it was found that the transition to superconductivity
(normally occurring at 3-73°K) was so smeared out that the resistance at 4:22° K was
already less than the residual resistance, owing to incipient superconductivity; this was

dealt with by applying a magnetic field large enough to restore a value of
seed
Ficure 19. Method of preparing tin alloy crystal: after crystallization from the
seed, the specimen was cut away at the two constrictions, leaving single-crystal
wires of the same orientation on either side, provided with potential leads for
resistance measurements.
