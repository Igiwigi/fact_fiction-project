He assumes that, for all practical purposes, the rate at which equilibrium
is established at the limiting surface between the two phases (solid-liquid or solid-gas)
is infinitely great compared with the rates of diffusion of the reacting substances on
to, or of the reaction product away from, the surface. Hence the velocity observed
in the system will depend not on the “order” of the reaction, but on the diffusion
factors only. Our experiments have proved that this “ diffusion” theory is incapable
of explaining the facts of the catalytic combination of hydrogen and oxygen. There
are clearly other factors which have a determining influence on the course of events. BoDENSTEN’s Haperiments.
