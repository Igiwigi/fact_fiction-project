Hydrogen pathways in renewable energy integrated systems

Intermittent power generation from renewable energy technologies requires storage technologies
that can provide storage capacity to balance supply and demand, with frequency control and
other benefits such as curtailment minimization, demand-side management, contingency grid
support, etc. [73]. Studies show the economic benefits of implementing storage to manage high
levels of renewable electricity generation (e.g. in the UK £10bnyr~! saving can potentially be
realized with storage technologies in a 2050 high renewable energy scenario) [74]. In fact, the cost
of wind power curtailment is increasing as their penetration increases; in 2014 Germany spent
€82m on electricity curtailment from wind power, and this cost is reported to be doubling every
year [75]. Besides hydrogen, several different technologies are being investigated for grid-scale
electricity storage including lithium ion batteries, redox flow batteries, compressed air energy
storage, supercapacitors, thermal energy storage and flywheels. See the UK white paper [76] on
grid-scale energy storage for more information on these technologies.
