The one is represented by
fig. 2 in Memoir IV. and fig. 11 in Memoir XVIL., the other by fig. 12 in Memoir XVII. In the former type the primary xylem forms an almost complete ring, or, at least,
is not differentiated into distinct bundles; in the second type, the bundles surrounding
the pith are quite distinct and normal, but the whole is on an extremely small scale. In fact, the smallest stems we have, one of which is only 3 millims. in diameter,
belong to this type. These smallest stems have secondary wood of considerable thick-
ness (about 14 cells thick). Cambium aud phlo√©m are well preserved, and the leaf-
traces are evident in the cortex.
