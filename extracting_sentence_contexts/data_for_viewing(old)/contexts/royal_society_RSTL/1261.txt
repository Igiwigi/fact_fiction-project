same' mixture, the gold was dissolved, and the smell of aqua
regia was instantly perceived.*

A portion of the said bittern was next examined by ap-
propriate re-agents, with a view to detect any minute quantity
of earths or metals, especially alumina, silica, iron and-copper,
which former inquirers might have overlooked; but I could
find no other earth except magnesia : and to my surprise, I
did not find in the bittern the least particle of lime ;- which
proves that sea-water contains no. muriate of lime, as had
been generally supposed. I was equally unsuccessful in my
attempts to detect iron or copper, bythe most delicate tests.
In fact, neither alkalies, nor alkaline carbonates, precipitated
any other substance from the bittern of sea-water, except
magnesia,

The deposit obtained at Portsmouth during the early
period of the concentration of the water, being analyzed, I
found it to consist of selenite, mixed with a little muriate of
soda, and a portion of carbonate of lime. The presence of
this last subtance in sea-water, in a state of perfect solution,
being, I believe, a new fact, I neglected no means of establish-
ing it with certainty, an object which was accomplished with-
out difficulty.
