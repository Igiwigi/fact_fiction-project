Dr. Ler (3) has, however, a quite significant change for the worse. The fact that in some cases the personal equation grows less, in others greater, in
the second half of the series seems to indicate that the changes in personal equation
were by no means due toa secular improvement in judgment.* Nor do they admit
of explanation on the assumption of increasing fatigue due to the exhaustion of the
power of attention. It must be remembered that the experiments were spread out
over a number of days, and this cause would only influence the latter experiments
on each day. My worst experiments on the bright line are the Series 321-347 and
504-520 (Observer (1) Column () Table TV.), but they are much above the average
in goodness for Dr.
