Still,
plate 2a is larger than plate 2b, and must have appeared after 2b, for in the case of the

succeeding plates, those in column 6 precede the corresponding ones in column a. Assuming that the large plate in area 1 is plate 2b only (not plate 2a ++ plate 2b as
indicated by Lovin), it also displaces plate 2a. The suggestion that no fusion of plates takes place is only tentative, and may not be
true. he difference existing between areas 1 and 4 (see fig. 5) cannot be due entirely
to the fact that area 4 is bounded on either side by two ambulacral columns belonging
to the second series—namely, IVb and Va—while area 1 is bounded by one column (Id)
of the second series and one (IIa) of the first series. The difference between the two
series of ambulacral columns is slight, and would not alter the inter-ambulacral plates to
a very marked extent. This is clearly seen in the case of areas 2 and 3 (fig. 5).
