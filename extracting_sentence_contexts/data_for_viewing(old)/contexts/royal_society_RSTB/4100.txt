an independent and a common anterior origin for the cavities has evidently
presented itself in the history of the Echinoderm as well as of the Enteropneust
phylum, and has received something like the same answer in both (see p. 233).
It may be added that the antero-dorsal position of the junction between preoral
and postoral bands in the early bipinnaria of A. rubens permits us to hold the
view that the so-called apical sense-organ of Tornaria represents a supra-cesophageal
ancestral structure.

The Adult.—The following table gives the homologies which, I think, are to be drawn
between Asterids and Enteropneusts. ‘The major comparisons seem to be reasonable,
and if that is so the minor ones should also be counted as valid, so long as they rest
on the same grounds as those by which the others are decided, and do not conflict
with ascertained facts :—
