that at the point where, under these circumstances, the contractions originate, there
are situated some scattered ganglionic cells of considerahle functional power, but yet
not of power enough to originate contractile waves unless re-enforced by some
stimulating influence which reaches them from the lithoeysb through the neryous
plexus. But whether or not this is the true interpretation of the facts, I think it is
evident that these facts are of considerable importance in relation to the theory of
ganglionic action which has already been s0 fully discussed in the first division of the
present paper. For, turning again to the woodeut (fig. 11), if the discharges of the
lithocyst are regulated only by resistance, it seems almost unaccountable that these
discharges should frequently fail to excite the contiguous area a@ @ @ z, while they
are effectual in exciting the remote area 2 2 2 2; and this even after 2 2 2 2 has been
almost completely severed from x > © & by the severity of the incisions. To my
mind, the facts seem rather to point to the conclusion that the lithoeysb is engaged in
emitting some sorb of continuous ganglionic impulse which spreads throughout the
nervous plexus, and helps to stimulate the ganglionic cells which are scattered
throughout this plexus. And this conclusion is not incompatible with the view that
the resistance which is offered by the plexus is 80 adjusted to the accumulation of
energy by the lithoeyst, that this energy admits of being periodically discharged in
greater amount, just at the time when the contractile tissues have completely recovered
from their exhaustion due to their previous contraction, In s8upport of this interpreta-
tion of the facts, it may be added that after the removal of the lithoeyst I tried the
effects of gently irritating the tissue in the area @ © @ » with a camel-hair pencil,
and I found that by 80 doing I could again excite the origination of contractile waves
from the point 0 in the area 22 2 2.
