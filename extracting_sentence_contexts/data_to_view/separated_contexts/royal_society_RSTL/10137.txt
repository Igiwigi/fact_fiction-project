The hook is the first

S pharyngo-branchial (p.br.), at its enlarged end, where it partly occludes the second
ſenestra (Plates 9 and 10), and the bar below is the narrow neck where the pterygoid
passes into the quadrate (q.), under the second fenestra. The basi-hyal (b.hy”.) is
like that of the last section. Section 24 (Plate 14, fig. 1).—This section sheds light upon the dissections, and is

also in turn explained by them.* Here, as in the last, the parachordals are very

* I must here repeat the fact that these sections show the cartilage to be hard, in places where in the
dissections it was soft, on account of the greater age of the specimen made into sections; where any other
apparent want of conformity exists between the two sets of observations, it is due to compression of the
specimen in cutting, for my best specimens were not well preseryed, and at the besb the pharynx and its
volum are very elastic and mobile.
