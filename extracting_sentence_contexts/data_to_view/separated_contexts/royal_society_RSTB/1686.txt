Neither
here nor in any other specimen, do we find any differentiated bundle-sheath or
epidermis ; considering the perfection of the preservation we are probably justified in
concluding that in Lyginodendron, as in the Marattiaces of the present day, a
specialized endodermis was not developed. Secretory sacs are scattered among the
phloém-elements. Every well-preserved transverse section of a petiole shows the same fact, that the
bundle was concentric Where two bundles are present, as usually happens in main
petioles, and sometimes in their secondary branches, each bundle is surrounded by its
own zone of phloém, except where the two are on the point of fusing (ef. Memoir —
XVIL, Plate 13, fig. 2). Longitudinal sections confirm these conclusions.t |

The position of the spiral tracheides or protoxylem in the petiolar bundle is not
always easy to determine in the transverse sections, but with the help of the longi-
tudinal sections this can be done.
