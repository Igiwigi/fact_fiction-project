NS? Many authors have speculated with the idea that brain,
ganglion or neural cells are arranged in any animal in accord-
ance with a major goal: to minimize the cost of connection
between the components (the ‘save wire’ principle [111,112]).
This principle that is derived from component network
optimization theory assumes that a network is selected if it
minimizes the total nerve connection length (taken as a proxy
for total connection costs). This condition constrains the geo-
metry of the network, provided that energy consumption is
efficient. The principle has been thoroughly analysed in the
context of the arrangement of the Caenorhabditis elegans NS
[111]; the rat olfactory cortex and the amygdala [113]; and
the cat sensory and macaque visual cortex [114]. In fact,
