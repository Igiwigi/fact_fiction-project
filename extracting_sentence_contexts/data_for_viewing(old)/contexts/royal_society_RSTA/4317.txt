where s; is an unknown 2z:-periodic ‘shape function’ which is adapted to the signal. The envelope
a;(t) and the phase function 6;(t) are smooth functions and are less oscillatory than s(6;(t)). We also
assume that 6;(t) > 0.

With the introduction of the shape function, the model has more degrees of freedom, which
makes the problem more difficult to solve. To simplify the problem, in this paper, we only consider
those signals that have one dominated shape function, ie. M=1 in (1.3). By exploring the fact
that the shape function is a periodic function of the phase function, @, we can identify a certain
low-rank structure of the signal. This structure enables us to extract the shape function from the
signal.

We remark that, in the model with the shape function, all intra-wave modulation is captured
by the shape function. The amplitude function a(t) and the phase function remain as smooth
functions, which means that they have only inter-wave modulation. If we adopt the definition of
the degree of nonlinearity from Huang et al. in [20], only the intra-wave modulation contributes to
the degree of nonlinearity. In this sense, the essential nonlinear feature of the signal is encoded in
the shape function. The amplitude and the phase function in the model using the shape function
would have no contribution to the degree of nonlinearity.
