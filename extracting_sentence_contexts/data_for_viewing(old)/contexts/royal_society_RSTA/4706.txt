(we are considering non-negative solutions of the evolution problem).

Nowadays, a reasonably complete theory of nonlinear diffusion with long-range effects
has been developed for this model, see for instance [22-25], or similar models like [26],
but we have to look elsewhere for free boundaries.

— Model II. A second model of nonlinear diffusion with fractional operators has been
studied by the second author in collaboration with Caffarelli and does give rise to
the occurrence of finite propagation and free boundaries. This alternative model is
derived in a more classical way from the PME since it is based on the usual Darcy law
(ie. the velocity of the particles is assumed to be the gradient of a pressure function,
v=-—vVp) with the novelty that the pressure is related to the density by an inverse
fractional Laplacian operator, p = Ku. Putting these two facts into the continuity equation,
du + V - (uv) = 0, the model takes the form

up = V(uVKu), (3.2)

a nonlinear fractional diffusion equation of porous medium type where K is the Riesz
operator that typically expresses the inverse to the fractional Laplacian, Ku =(—A)~*u.
This has been studied by Caffarelli & Vazquez [27,28]. In dimension N = 1, this model was
studied by Biler et al. [29,30] as a model for the propagation of dislocations as proposed by
Head [31]. Since it was extensively reported in a survey paper [9] we will only point out
the established theory of weak solutions, and the lack of uniqueness results in several
dimensions, and concentrate on the existence and properties of the free boundaries.
Self-similar solutions exist and their existence and properties are very illustrative of the
