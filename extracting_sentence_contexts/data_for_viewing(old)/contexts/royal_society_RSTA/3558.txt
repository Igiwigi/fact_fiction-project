In the context of the transition from conventional power systems to low-carbon energy systems, 74
whereby a control-based paradigm relying on flexible smart grid technologies replaces the ae
classic asset-based paradigm, this paper has discussed some of the main challenges associated [es
with planning future energy systems to securely and cost-effectively integrate renewable energy :8
sources. In particular, we have presented an optimization framework to plan electricity grids that .
deals with uncertainty and properly accounts for relevant operational constraints, so that truly
optimal solutions, based on flexible technologies, can be determined (although this is limited, in
practice, by computational burden and the ability to deal with very large optimization problems
through suitable algorithms). In fact, the resulting investment options contain an array of smart
grid technologies that can effectively provide the needed flexibility in operation to cope with
renewablesâ€™ fluctuations and the necessary adaptation capacity in the long term to adjust system
expansion more cost-effectively even under the occurrence of unfavourable scenarios. We thus
demonstrated that and how smart grid technologies can displace the need for conventional
network assets that are instead preferable when uncertainty is ignored and operational constraints
are neglected.

Two key conceptual results of our work, with important policy implications, are (i) investment
in specific low-carbon generation technologies over time may strongly depend on the
(deterministic, stochastic or robust) approach and risk aversion of the planner, and (ii) optimal
generation investment decisions need to be complemented by decisions on investment in smart
grid technologies and/or network assets. In these regards, the proposed model allows one to
