The yellow tissne of the corpus
luteum was made up of a fibro-celluiar stroma, in which there was enclosed a number
of large granular corpuscles, some of which contained oil-globules ; besides these,
there was a liquid fat diffused through the tissue, which appeared either as minute
particles, or as large elongated highly refractive globules that had been produced by
the union of the smaller elements (see fig. 10). Remarks—An examination of the preceding facts will, I think, justify me in
coming to the following conclusions ; namely, that ovules escape from the ovaries of
women during the catamenial flux; and that the escape of these bodies is spontaneous,
id est, that their extrusion takes place independently of sexual intercourse. In these
respects, the phenomena witnessed are perfectly analogous with those observed by
Biscnory, RaciBorsx1, Poucuer and others, while they were instituting inquiries into
the changes which occur in the ovaries of other mammals during the periods of heat
and rut; and they are also in accordance with a fact long since ascertained by phy-
Siologists, namely, that there is a periodical maturation and spontaneous extrusion of
oyules from the ovaries of animals still lower in the scale of creation. Hitherto,
however, these several circumstances have been regarded only in the light of pro-
bable analogies; but I am of opinion that the facts detailed in this paper are quite
sufficient to identify the phenomena in question, and also to establish the truth of a
great part of the law enunciated by Biscnory, that is, that the oyules formed in the
ovaries of females of the human epecies, and of mammiferons animals, undergo a
periodical maturation, quite independently of the influence of the male seminal fluid ;
and that at the periods of menstruation in the one, and heat in the other, the ova
which have become mature disengage themselyes from the oyary, and are extruded

whether there be access of the male or no.
