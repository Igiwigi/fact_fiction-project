This magnetometer was found very satisfactory and showed the great effectiveness of
this method of achieving a high astaticism. Under favourable conditions the mean error of
a reading was not very much larger than the calculated thermal value. It was thought possible that the fact that the mean error was normally considerably
greater than the thermal error might be due to fluctuations of the vertical gradient of the
earth’s horizontal field. To eliminate this effect a parastatic system was built, with four
magnets consisting of pieces of Caslox 2-5 x 0-55cm magnetized transversely. As this
material is machinable, holes were drilled along their long axis, and they were threaded
like beads on to lengths of phosphor-bronze wire which were attached to a short Perspex
