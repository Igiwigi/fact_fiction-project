few days previously to making these observations that I first noticed the interesting
fact, that each individual insect maintains its own temperature, which is perceptible
externally by the thermometer, and that the amount of this varies in the different
conditions of the same insect. The observation was first made on the larva of Sphinx
Atropos, LaxN., and on that of Pygara bucephala, STEPn., as will presently be
shown.

During the time I have been engaged in preparing the present communication
