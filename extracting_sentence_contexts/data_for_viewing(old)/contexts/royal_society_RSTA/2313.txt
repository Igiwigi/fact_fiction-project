Beyond cyclic systems, however, we know that CNT; and CNT3 are not generally related to each : >
other by any function [27]. The relationships between the three CbD-based measures and CNTF y
is yet to be investigated. Do
8.4 It is worth mentioning that all measures of contextuality (and non-contextuality) involve : Ny
a certain degree of arbitrariness. For instance, both CNT; and CNT? could be constructed with [88
another Ly or Loo replacing L1, and there seem to be no unchallengeable principles to guide one’s 28
choice (although L; may be argued to be preferable because of the additivity of probabilities). The 1S
choice of a reduced vector of probabilities adds another dimension of arbitrariness: although all
reduced representations are linear transformations of the complete one, min L1-distance values
for them may not be related to each other in a simple way. It seems therefore that one could
profitably use several measures to characterize a given system. At the same time, the fact that
only some measures of contextuality naturally extend into measures of non-contextuality may
provide principled guidance in constraining the multitude of possibilities.
