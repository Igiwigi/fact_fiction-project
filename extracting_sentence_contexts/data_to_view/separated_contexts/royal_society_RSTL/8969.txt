In such cases it usually dwells longest and most frequently on those points
which have been irritated most sevyerely. I think the object of these movements is probably that of stinging the offending body
by means of the urticating cells with which the extremity of the polypite is armed. But, be the object what it may, the fact of these movements occurring is a highly
important one in connexion with our study of the distribution of neryes in Meduxe ;
and the first point to be made out with regard to these movements is clearly as to
whether or not they are of a truly reflex character. Accordingly I first tried cutting
off the margin and then irritating the muscular tissue of the bell; the movements in
question were performed exactly as before. These movements, therefore, supply an
additional instance of the rule laid down in my former paper, viz. : * Every Medusa,
when its centres of spontaneity have been removed, responds to a single stimulation by
once performing that action which it would have performed in response to that stimu-
lation had its centres of spontaneity still been intact.‚Äù Now the fact of this rule
holding good in this case opens up an interesting subject for our contemplation.
