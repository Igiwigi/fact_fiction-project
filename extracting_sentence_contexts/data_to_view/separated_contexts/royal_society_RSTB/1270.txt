In answer to this we find sterile cells in large numbers distributed thro
sporogenous masses in Hquisetum, Tmesipteris, and Psilotum. The criticism m
advanced that this is merely a physiological phenomenon depending on nutr
but in this I see no real objection, for such physiological phenomena have |:
affected the course of evolution, and, in fact, morphology should be looked up
little more than the study of stereotyped physiology. In view of the facts
tained from the Hepaticee, we cannot pass over the existence of these sterile cell
matter of no morphological importance. It is true they do not form firm y
develop into cells such as the elaters: they are to be compared rather witl
sterile cells in the sporogonium of Oaymitra (Lerraks, loc. cit., Heft 4, p- 48).
