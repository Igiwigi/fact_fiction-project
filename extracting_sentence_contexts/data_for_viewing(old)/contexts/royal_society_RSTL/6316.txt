figure, not merely of the shell, but also of the pseudopodia protruded from various parts
of its surface; as well as to make preparations of the sarcode-body of the animal, by
dissolving away the shell in dilute acid. He does not seem, however, to have had the
advantage of a full knowledge of Professor W1LLIAMs0N's memoir; his acquaintance
with it being apparently limited to the abstract of it contained in * T/Institut” (No. 787);
and I find in his description of the shell a confirmation of the belief I have already had
occasion to express, that he has not availed himself as fully as is desirable of the mode
of examining the intimate structure of these minute objects by the preparation of very
thin sections. In every point, in fact, in which he differs from Professor WiLLIaMsox,
I am satisfied that the truth lies with the latter; and this not merely on account of the
entire coincidence between the results of my own inquiries into the structure of Poly-
somella erispa and those of my accomplished predecessor, but also because our views
are in every respect borne out by the structure of the much larger and more highly
developed form of Polystomella which I am presently to describe. One point in Pro-
fessor SCHULTZE'S description, however, requires special notice. He states that each of
the crenulated prominences which are seen on the surface of the lateral walls of the
chambers is trayersed longitudinally by a wedge-shaped fissure, that is narrowest as it
approaches the septal band, near which it penetrates the cavity of the chamber, whilst
it becomes shallower as it widens out at the part where the crenulation merges in the
smooth wall of the shell. I expect to be able to show that the supposed © fissures ” of
Professor SCHULTZE no. more communicate with the cavity of the chambers, than do the
