The fact that the readings are not identical is not important, as ARRHENIUS expressly states that his
electrodes suffered change in course of the investigation ; but it will be observed that the differences are
quite capricious. Thus the second reading for sodium chloride is 60 per cent. greater than the first, whilst
for rubidium chloride the second reading is 25 per cent. less than the first. We are unable to conjecture
any satisfactory explanation of these discrepancies.
