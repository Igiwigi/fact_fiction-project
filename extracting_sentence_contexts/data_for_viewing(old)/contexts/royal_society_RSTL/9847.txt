EZ 21 diameters, its actual breadth being about *2. The vascular bundles, «, and their
E *  8urrounding cylinders of inner bark c of two similar rootlets are further enlarged in
S figs. 18 and 19. We now find that the vessels of fig. 18 have increased to 18, and
= in fig. 19 to 22 in number. But even this is not the final increase, since I have
5 two rootlets in my cabinet each of which has a diameter of fully 4. The central
© portion of one of these is represented in fig. 20, in which the vessels composing the

bundle have increased to 38 in number, the last formed ones, a', being much smaller in
8ize than those which immediately preceded them. The first formed ones, «, have, in
this instance, become accidentally detached from the inner bark cylinder, which is a
rather unusnal occurrence.

The illustrations I have given will, I think, demonstrate the fact that we have in each
of these rootlets a single vascular bundle that commences its development eccentrically
in relation to the centre of the rootlet to which it belongs, and that, proceeding from
this one pole, it is developed centripetally, the extent of that development, including
the number of its constituent vessels, bearing a general relation to the age of the
