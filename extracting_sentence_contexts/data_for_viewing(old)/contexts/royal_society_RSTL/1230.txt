When the powers are feeble, acids and alkalies, and acids
and metallic oxides, merely separate from each other ; when
they are increased to a certain degree, the common me-
tallic oxides and the compound acids are decomposed ; and
by means still more exalted, the alkalies yield their elements.
And as far as our knowledge of the composition of bodies
extends, all substances attracted by positive electricity, are
oxygene, or such as contain oxygene in excess ; and all that
are attracted by negative electricity, are pure combustibles, or
such as consist chiefly of combustible matter,

The idea of muriatic acid, fluoric acid, and boracic acid con-
taining oxygene, is highly strengthened by these facts. And
the general principle confirms the conjecture just stated con-
cerning the nature of the earths.

In the electrization of boracic acid moistened with water, I
find that a dark coloured combustible matter is evolved at the
negative surface ; but the researeches upon the alkalies have
prevented me from pursuing this fact, which seems however
to indicate a decomposition.

Muriatic acid and fluoric acid in their gaseous states are
non-conductors : and as there is every reason to believe that
their bases have a stronger attraction for ox ygene than water,
