All the Simiz have invariably circular pupils, which dilate to mydriatics and
contract to myotics, convergence, and light, and in that respect there is no difference
except in degree between Man and the other Simiw. The Simi are the only
Mammals which have the visual axes parallel, and which possess the power of con-
vergence, factors which seem to be the necessary consequence of the presence of a
macula, This convergence is longest sustained in Man, most of the Monkeys being
only able to converge for a very short period. In fact, the Mandril (Cynocephalus
mormon), the Black Ape (Cynopithecus niger), and the Red Howler (Mycetes seni-
culus) are the only Monkeys in which I have observed any sustained convergence.
