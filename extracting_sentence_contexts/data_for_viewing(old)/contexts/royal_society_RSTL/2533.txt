indications of the instrument also was risked, owing to three fourths of the stem of
the thermometer being exposed to the wind or cold air during the time of the im-
mersion of the bulb in the boiling water, which checked the rise of the mercury.

Having for several years practised the barometrical and thermometrical methods
to determine heights, I have no hesitation in expressing my opinion, that a good
thermometer and a boiling-pot may efficiently supply the place of the expensive and
delicate barometer where great accuracy is not required, In many instances I found
the results by the two processes almost identical.

My electrometers consisted of two balls of pith suspended in small glass jars capped
with brass, having an elevated point on the plane of one cap, and a wire projecting
from the apex of the other, which was bell-shaped. They were in fact CavaLLo's
pith ball bottle electrometers, with SaussuRe's addition of pointed wires, but without
a graduated scale on the bottle to measure the divergence of the balls. Owing to
some peculiarity in the instruments, they feebly indicated the presence of electricity
in the atmosphere, although at certain seasons it was 80 rife as to be painful to the
feelings. When first received, they were sensible to artificial electricity, but latterly,
without having been injured, they lost all susceptibility. I never could make a record
of their indications. Even had they been available, the want of a scale rendered it im-
possible to give any positive idea of the extent of the electric state of the atmosphere
at any time. A scale, in case it did not measure definite quantities, would neverthe-
less be highly useful to determine the electricity of any particular period relatively to
that of any other period.
