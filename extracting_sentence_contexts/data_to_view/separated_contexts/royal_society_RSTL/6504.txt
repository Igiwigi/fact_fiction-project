These illustrations may be extended at pleasure. Since my original communication to the Royal Society, an * eighth article,” by Pro-
fessor Loomis, has appeared in the © American Journal,” vol, xxxii., November 1861. On
discussing the results accumulated in America, he infers that all the facts are consistent
with the supposition of electric currents moving to and fro on the earth's snrface, the
average direction of which, on that continent, is from about N. 45* E. to S. 45* W., a
result remarkably in accordance with the conclusions to which we have arrived by a
somewhat different process for the S.F. part of England. He has also discussed, in quite
another way, the magnetic disturbances in Europe ; and he obtains a direction for the
electric wave, connected with those disturbances, from N. 28* E. to S. 28* W. over the
surface of Europe. These approximations are noteworthy.
