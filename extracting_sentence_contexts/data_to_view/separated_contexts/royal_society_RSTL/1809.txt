Hence the electro-magnetic effects of two
batteries are within certain limits proportional to the quantities of water de-
composed. 18. These principles will enable us to account for a fact in electro-magnetism
which has never been explained in a satisfactory manner. Since the discoveries
in electro-magnetism, it was obseryed that no increase of electro-magnetic
power is gained by increasing the number of plates in a battery, when the
extreme plates were connected by metallic contact with the ends of the battery. This unexpected result has been accounted for by supposing that voltaic electri-
city, having tension like common electricity, acts feebly on a magnetic needle.
