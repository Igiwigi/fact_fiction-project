Although not comparable with that on quantum theory, there is also a consistent literature 4 |
on the foundations of classical probability. Starting from previous ideas of Ramsay, De

Finetti succeeded in deducing the basic elementary laws of probability (including conditional â€œ3
probability) from axioms formulated uniquely in terms of bets, gains and losses. However, these :8
attempts are not completely formalized (in the Hilbert sense) and what, in my opinion, is a more ig
serious critique to this approach from a conceptual point of view is the fact that properties of what : a
should be a basic notion such as probability are deduced from notions which are semantically : 2
much more complex and difficult to formalize, such as bets, gains, losses .. .. [2

(b) The quantum probabilistic approach

In the analogy between geometry and probability, quantum probability can be compared to non-

Euclidean geometries with the difference, however, that while in the case of geometry it was clear : =
since the beginning which of the Euclidean axioms were modified in the new models (basically : a
the parallel axiom), in the case of probability the new mathematical model has preceded the : 2
recognition of which of the axioms of classical probability is violated by it. The first step of the aes
quantum probabilistic approach has been to individuate this hidden axiom in the elementary 22
definition of conditional probability in terms of joint probabilities (Bayes formula). The term [4
hidden axiom is justified by the fact that in usual textbooks on probability Bayes formula is used as : *
the definition of conditional probability.
