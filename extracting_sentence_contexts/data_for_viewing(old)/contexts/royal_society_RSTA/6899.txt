where the ratio A:y fixes a stratum, and the & parameters ¢; fix a point of the stratum.
In this notation the typical point {D, 0, D,0} of D appears as the two rowed matrix

In fact the first e, co-ordinates x;, and also the first e, of the y,, are obtained from the
coefficients of p and o respectively in L,,4, since L, = pD,+oD,, where 0 is a complete

By identifying (6) and (7) we obtain all possible points common to D and -%. It
