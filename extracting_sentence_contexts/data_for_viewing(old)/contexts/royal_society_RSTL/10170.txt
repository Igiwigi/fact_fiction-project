31. The temperature.—The chief reagon why the water from the main had been
used was from the necessity of having constant temperature throughout, the experi-
ments, and my previous experience of the great constaney of the temperature of the
water in bhe mains, even over a period of some weeks.

At the commencement of the experiments the temperature of the water when
flowing freely was found to be 5 C. or 41* F., and it remained the same throughout
the experiments. Nevertheless, a fact which had been overlooked caused the
temperature in the pipes to vary 8omewhat and in a manner somewhat difficult to
determine.

This fact, which was not discovered until after the experiments had been reduced,
was that the temperature of the workshop being above that of the main, the water
would be warmed in flowing through the pipes to an extent depending on its flow.
The poxsibility of this had nob been altogether overlooked, and an early observation
was made to 8ee if any such warming occurred, but as it was found to be less than
half a degree no further notice was taken until on reducing the results it was found
that the velocities obtained with the very smallest discharges presented considerable
discrepancies in various experiments ; this 8uggested the cause.
