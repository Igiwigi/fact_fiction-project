of this desensitization in understanding the generation of
the quantal response is underscored by the fact that blocking
desensitization leads to a large increase in the total charge of
the mEPSC, primarily due to increased duration of the
response. The operation of the AMPA channel can be under-
stood as a race between activation, which can occur very
quickly if the concentration of glutamate is high, and desen-
sitization, which is slower but is stimulated by lower
concentrations. Within the hotspot, activation beats desensiti-
zation. However, further away from the site of vesicle release,
desensitization beats activation, and there are therefore few
channel openings. Distant channel openings do, however,
occur if desensitization is blocked, a fact that will become
important in the discussion of the structure/function of
the synapse in ยง4.

The existence of a hotspot of channel activation during
mEPSP generation has major implications for understanding
the synaptic response and the concept of synaptic strength.
Notably, because the quantal current is generated only
within a small subregion of the synapse, the size of the quant-
al response will not be substantially affected by growth of the
synapse. It is for this reason that as discussed earlier, late LTP
is not associated with an increase in quantal size. Thus,
quantal size is not a reliable indicator of synaptic strength.
