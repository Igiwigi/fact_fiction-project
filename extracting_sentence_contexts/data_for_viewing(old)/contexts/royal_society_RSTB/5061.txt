218 JOHN WALTON ON CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE

Isolated fructifications of Telangium consist of synangia or of seed-cupules attached to
naked rachises, which exhibit ‘‘ the characteristic dichotomisation of the fructifying
branches of this species, and in fact of the genus Calymmatotheca.”* The fact that none
of the pinne attached to this particular frond show this type of branching is another
argument against supposing them to be fertile divisions of the frond.

The thicker, forking rachis seen on the right (Plate 17, fig. 24, ¢), lying between the pinna
at the base of the right-hand arm and the next one above it on the same side, is very
like a typical Telangium fertile rachis. It is attached to some of the cupules and is, I
think, the only fragment of fertile rachis visible on the specimen. This fertile rachis
is not, however, seen in connection with the frond. It is clearly different from the pinnz
of the frond in its state of preservation, as it is in the form of a hollow cast, while they
are in the form of flattened incrustations. All the usual places for the insertion of pinne
are occupied in its immediate vicinity, so that it is not likely to be a modified pinna.
