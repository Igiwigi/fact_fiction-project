We do not think that such a view is tenable. We have direct evidence
(see above, p. 823) that such strands with secondary wood of their own are continuous
with the paired bundles passing out from the pith. These bundles originate by the

division of a single xylem-strand and are clearly of leaf-trace nature ; there are in
fact no other structures present which could represent the leaf-traces. Further it is
highly unlikely that two branches should be given off side by side. It might perhaps
be suggested that one strand of the pair was a leaf-trace and the other the stele of a
branch, but there is no sign of any essential difference between them.
