KANE ON THE CHEMICAL HISTORY OF ARCHIL AND LITMUS. 275

same ultimate coloured substance? 'These are questions which it will be at once
8een all preceding researches leave quite untouched, and they must evidently be, at
least in great part, 'solved before any considerable portion of light can be thrown
upon this difficult part of science. I do not pretend to haye established in the present paper a complete solution of
those difficult questions. In fact, months of continued investigation have proved to
me, that the subject is still more complex than the statement above given would
point it out to be. If my results appear to have placed the problem of the origin and
constitution of these bodies in a more definite light than that in which it had pre-
viously been contemplated, and to have shown at least the difficulties of the subject,
if not positively to have removed any of them, I shall consider the object for which I
now submit to the scientific world these contributions to our knowledge in this de-
partment, as sufliciently attained. The object of the present paper being threefold, viz. first, to ascertain the primi-
tive form of the colour-making suhbstance in a given species of lichen, and trace the
stages through which it passes before the coloured substance is developed ; secondly,
to determine the nature of the various colouring substances which exist in the archil
of commerce; and thirdly, the examination of the colouring materials of ordinary
litmus ; it will be found convenient to divide the paper into three sections under these
three heads, and to treat of the subjects in the order above described.
