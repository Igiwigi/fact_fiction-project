bub before it can be applied to the study in question, we have to settle the chemical
origin of the different spectra which we observe in tubes, and to discuss in what way
such spectra are liable to change under different cireumstances. A special investiga-
tion has to be made for each gas ; we have to study the effect of various impurities,
the influence of the electrodes and that of the glass, which in the tubes generally used
is considerably heated up by the spark. To make the investigation complete we have
to vary as much as possible the pressure, the bore of the vacuum tube, and the strength
of the spark.

I have chosen Oxygen as a firs subject of investigation. Though P1vyoreR and
WoLixeR have, as far as their experiments went, accurately described the phenomena
8een in oxygen tubes, the following paper contains much that is new, and will put
some of the older facts on a firmer basis. When T firs began to work, it was my
intention to take the gases in groups, and to study their mixture ; bub as the follow-
ing investigation has taken me a year's nearly continuous work, and is complete in
itself, I trust it will not be found unworthy of publication. I must, of course, at
present confine myself to the purely spectroscopic point of view. As several of the
observations which I shall have to record bear directly on the general theory of double
spectra, I must briefly refer to our knowledge on that point.

2. Multiple Spectra.

We may roughly divide all known spectra into three kinds or orders : continuous
Spectra, line spectra, and, standing between them, spectra of fluted bands or channelled
Spaces, as they are commonly called.
