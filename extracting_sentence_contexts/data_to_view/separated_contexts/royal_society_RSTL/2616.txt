The real use of the
pulmonary sacs, which are found in all volant insects, appears to be, as snpposed by
Joan Huwres, to enable the individual to alter its specific gravity at pleasure by en-
larging its bulk, and thus render it better able to sustain itself on the wing with but
little muscular effort. That this is the real use of the sacs may further be inferred
from their non-existence in the larva or infant condition of the insect, and from their
almost entire absence in all insects which are destined to live entirely on the ground. This opinion is further supported by the fact that they are most developed, relatively
to the 8ize of the individual, in those insects which sustain the longest and most
powerful flight, as Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, some of the winged Coleoptera, the
Hemiptera and Lucani, while in none of these insects in the larva state is there any-

thing approaching to sacs, but the respiratory organs are purely tracheal. The
common Humble-bee, which has the largest pulmonary vesicles of any insect in the
perfect state, has its respiratory organs in the larya state exceedingly small and pen-
cillated. But further proof of the vesicles being for the sole purpose of lightening
the bodyis to be found in the male Lucanus cervus, LINN.
