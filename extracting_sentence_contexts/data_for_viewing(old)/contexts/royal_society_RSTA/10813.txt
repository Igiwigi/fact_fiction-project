chosen as having been pursued to the greatest rarefactions. The gas was dried
carefully with phosphoric anhydride and was introduced into the apparatus as already
described. It is thought sufficient to record only numbers corresponding to the
three last columns of ‘lables I.-—VII., the first column giving the pressure in
millims. of mereury, the second the deviation of pv from the mean value of the
set taken as unity, the third the error in p from what would be required to make
pv absolutely constant.

* Thad at one time contemplated an apparatus from which a further ten-fold increase in accuracy might
he expected. Two beams of light, reflected nearly perpendicularly from the mercury surfaces, would be
brought to interference by an arrangement similar to that used in investigating the refractivity of gases
(‘Proc. Roy. Soe.,’ vol. 59, p. 200, 1896; vol. 64, p- 97, 1898). Preliminary trials proved that the
inethod is feasible ; but the delicacy is excessive in view of the fact that according to Hertz the pressure
of mercury vapour at common temperatures itself amounts to -001 millim.
