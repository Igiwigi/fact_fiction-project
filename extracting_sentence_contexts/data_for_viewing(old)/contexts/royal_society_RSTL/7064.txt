positive.

Paxr IL—ON THE LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF REAL ROOTS IN EQUATIONS
OF THE FORM ZE(aw+d)*.

(15) I shall now proceed to the consideration of a theorem relating to a particular
class of ordinary equations, which occurred to me in the course of and .in connexion
with the preceding investigations. The theorem itself, but unaccompanied by proof, has
appeared in the * Comptes Rendus* of the Academy for the month of March 1864.

Both as regards its nature and the processes inyolved in the proof, it stands in close
relation to NEwToN's rule, my study of which in fact led me to its discovery. It will
therefore take its place most appropriately in this paper.


AND IMAGINARY ROOTS OF EQUATIONS. 599

Certain preliminary properties of circulation introducing some new notions of polarity
must be first established, by way of Lemmas to the proof in question.

By a type let us understand a 8uccession of symbols of any subject matter whatever
gusceptible of receiving the 8igns +—, or any suchlike indications of oppoxite polarity.

Let a, 6, 0c, ... , k, | be any such type, where the elements a, b, c, ... may be regarded
