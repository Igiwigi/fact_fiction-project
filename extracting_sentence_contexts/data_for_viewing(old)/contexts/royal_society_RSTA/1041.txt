Figure 5. (a) Stochastic bifurcation diagram for the probability distribution of stretches as function of dead load, t, for a
stochastic neo-Hookean cube with ; = 400, o, = 0.0013. The probability distribution follows the stable branches of the _
bifurcation diagram (see also figure 2). The two black solid lines delineate the expected regions of equilibria based solely on the =
mean value of the shear modulus, p2 = 01/2. (6) Assumed Gamma distribution with o,; = 400, 2 = 0.0013 for the random : $s

is unique. Alternatively, in the case where there are multiple stable branches, one of the branches ia
is always the trivial reference state. In this case, we assume that the reference state is chosen. This 4
assumption is based on the fact that the dead load is added to the reference state and, thus, unless 4
perturbed in some way, it will remain in this state. +
The stable equilibria are illustrated in the stochastic bifurcation diagram shown in figure 5a,
where p; =400, p2 =0.0013. Hence = p1p2=0.52, and we can see that the probability
distribution follows the stable branches of the bifurcation diagram (cf. figure 2). Moreover,
figure 5b shows that the probability of the cube presenting the trivial reference state is
approximately 50%, which matches the probability derived above. Namely, the probability that
the trivial state, with A = 1, is observed is the probability that there is only one equilibrium, or that
there are three equilibria, i.e. P} + P3 ~50%. The complementary 50% appears as a distribution
around A ~ 0.38, which is the stable non-trivial stretch for the given t and Gamma-distributed wu.
In summary, for a stochastic neo-Hookean cube, under uniform tensile dead loads, given a
shear modulus taken from a known Gamma probability distribution, we obtain the probabilities
of stable equilibrium states. For the deterministic elastic problem, which is based on mean
