The advantages of using such a technique would
be that, firstly, it is a well-established technique, with studies being done on neural probes as
early as 1997 [70], meaning that there is substantial literature to compare to when performing
experiments. Moreover, as reported in the literature, low thicknesses of approximately 15 ym have
been achieved by Dahiya et al. [71] in flexible substrates using tetramethylammonium hydroxide
(TMAH) as the etchant, demonstrating its potential for translation to neural probe scenarios,
where low thicknesses are desirable. However, one should note that this technique also poses
some challenges such as the fact the wafer could be too sensitive to the etchant concentration [72]. Furthermore, in more recent years, more research studies have been published on other
methods of chip thinning such as layer transfer methods and epitaxial-based wafers, which will
be briefly introduced. The former set includes methods such as proton-induced exfoliation which
uses a beam of hydrogen ions to, as its name suggests, exfoliate a layer of the wafer when they are
heated.
