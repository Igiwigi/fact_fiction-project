particular ad hoc combination used was determined after the fact (i.e. once
it was known that transitions had occurred). Ideally, we want a theoretically
grounded a priori early warning indicator that is not case-specific. Motivated
by these considerations, we also examine changes in variance in our chosen
datasets below.

A further problem for any would-be tipping point early warning system is
that of ‘missed alarms’ (false-negatives). This arises because not all candidate
tipping points can be characterized by underlying bifurcations [1]. Also, abrupt
noise-induced transitions can potentially occur in the climate system without any
change in the stability properties of the initial climate state (i.e. the shape of the
underlying potential) [13]. Such events are not expected to show any trend of
critical slowing down prior to a transition (in contrast to slow forcing towards
