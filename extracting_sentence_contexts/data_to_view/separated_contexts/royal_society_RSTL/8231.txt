Along such lines of volcanoes one vent or another may start into activity,
according as the crushing energy beneath supplies more heat and pulverized material
than another; and we find an explanation for the observed (or supposed to be obseryed)
fact without calling in the very crude notion that one volcanic vent relieves another, all
drawing from a. common fiery ocean or from lakes beneath. ,

221. We also see that it is but a partial view to say the volcano is a safety-valve to
the earthquake ; for the volcano is really the safety-valve for the relief from time to time
of the effects of contraction by cooling of our globe ; and there is perhaps no more
convincing consideration, indicating that the motive cause here assigned for vulcanicity
is the true one, than is found in the fact that the assigned mechanism is one of nature's
balancing adjustments, that the volcano's work is exactly proportionate to the crushing
energy of the contraction that brings it forth, and which is thus drained off, gradually
on the whole, though intermittently, in place of accumulating, until by the crushing
together of vast masses at once of the earth's thick crust, cataclysm must arise destructive

< to the living creation. The action resembles that of the escapement of a clock, which
© lets the weight drop not uniformly, but slowly and gently, which if permitted to
> descend suddenly through a large space, must destroy the machine.

222. If, then, this be the true nature of volcanic activity upon our globe, it must be

Z 0 for other planets, s0 far as their construction is analogous to that of our own.
