That the general relation between the barometrical changes and the
yariations of temperature, appears to be direct during the morning
hours, and inverse during those of the day and evening. 9. The singular fact, that while a period of fifteen days gives a mean day
generally distinguished by its relative variations at noon and mid-
night, a period of one month, or a complete lunation, not only gives
a gradual succession of variations, but, in all these obseryations, a
result almost identical in character and amount with the combined
result of the whole. Among the investigations in which I am at present engaged, are those
relating to the following inquiries: 1. To ascertain whether the mercurial
vapour in the vacuum chamber of the barometer, sensibly influences the
height of the column at the ordinary variations of the temperature of the
atmosphere.
