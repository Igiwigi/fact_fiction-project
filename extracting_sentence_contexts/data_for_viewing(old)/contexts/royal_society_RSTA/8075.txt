A comparative study of (a), (b) and (c) of fig. 10 suggests that the most active region
of the thundercloud came nearer the station on October 6 than on September 6 or 7.

This is supported by the fact that the lightning discharges produced more violent
changes in the electrogram of October 6, during the passage overhead of the most
active region of the cloud, than on the other two occasions.

* Recent observations of the sounds produced by explosion suggest a velocity of about 340 metres per
second, vide F. J. W. Wurepte, ‘ Solar and Terrestrial Relationships,’ International Research Council,
Second Report, pp. 114-125; also Gurensere, ‘ Z. Geophysik,’ vol. 2, p. 105 (1926).

+ These curves have been drawn so as to lie evenly about the observational points. Theoretically, the
curves should be hyperbolas on the assumption of uniform movements of the clouds. They are in fact
very flat hyperbolas almost coinciding with the asymptotes,

It will thus be clear that the thunder-lightning intervals generally support the con-
clusions made regarding the position and movements of the most active region of these
thunderclouds from a study of the electrograms, the charge records, and the pluviograms.

6. The quick-run records of changes in the electric field.

As already explained, the changes in the electric field produced by lightning discharges
