This discussion has shown that the connection between the Poincaré sphere of classical
harmonic oscillator orbits and Gaussian beams is best approached semiclassically, by associating
Gaussian beams not with a single point on the sphere but with a family of classical orbits on
a circle whose axis is specified by the point on the sphere, and whose radius is determined by
the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition, known to be exact for harmonic oscillators. The structure of the


caustics of the ellipse family determine the structure of the Gaussian modes, and, in particular,
are circular and rectangular for LG and HG beams. The families of ellipses in figure 6d-f, which semiclassically represent LG, HG and GG modes,
respectively, correspond to all of the classical orbits with this particular value of H and L,M or
XM + YM + ZL; in the original Hamiltonian phase space, these values are on tori, as discussed
in §2, and the ellipse families plotted are, in fact, projections of these tori onto two-dimensional
configuration space (Qy, Qy). The fact that they are tori is evident: the circularly symmetric case
of figure 6d is a projection down the torus axis, (¢) is a side view and (f) is a typical view without
any special symmetries. A full discussion of separability of Gaussian wavepackets is beyond the scope of the present
article, and can be approached by a reformulation of the mechanical problem in terms of the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
