Some, s8uch as those of the 5th and 10th June and the 7th
and 8th October, 1869 (ï¬†pra LV., V.), also a storm that occurred during the present year
(1872) on the 30th June and 1st JulyF, originate about the middle of the Bay. But Ido
not know of a single case in which a cyclone has been actually formed in the north-west
of the Bay, or under the lee of the Madras coast, although more than one case has been
recorded in which most of the requisite conditions were fulfilled, and in which for some
days there has seemed reason for apprehending one}. These facts, I think, find their
explanation in another fact, surmised by Colonel GASTRELL and myself as a probable
local law in 18654, and verified in the case of every storm I have yet investigated
(where sufficient evidence has been forthcoming), viz. that the formation of a cyclone is
determined by an inrush of a saturated stormy current from the south-west or west-
south-west. Now, under the lee of the Madras coast or in the north-west of the Bay, any
wind coming from this direction must pass over the peninsula, a course which would drain
it to a great extent of its vapour, while its free passage would be enormously impeded
by friction and the irregularities of the land-surface ; but in the eastern half of the Bay
no such impediments present themselves to its free access, and its high velocity and
abundant yapour seem to be the determining conditions of the formation, of cyclones.
