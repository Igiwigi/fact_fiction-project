If there is a brief episode
of quadratic phase coupling (QPC), the Fourier-based BS method cannot detect it from the signal
due to the large time window used. On the contrary, the WBS will detect it, down to a certain
minimum duration; thus the WBS allows intermittent couplings to be detected [4,5]. In fact, WBS
represents a significant improvement in the time resolution of the BS. To date there has been some notable uses of WBS, yet not at the level of the BS alone and even
less when compared to the prolific use of the CWT. However, there are some key areas where
WBS analysis has made some clear inroads.
