On the one hand it is most
closely approached by the flattened Australian skulls... from which other
Australian forms lead us gradually up to skulls having very much the type of the
Engis cranium. . . ” and, again, “in conclusion, I may say that the fossil remains
of Man hitherto discovered do not seem to me to take us appreciably nearer to that
lower pithecoid form, by the modification of which he has probably become what
he is.” This expression of opinion I believe to have been a strictly logical inference from
the facts as they were known at the time. Professor ScHwWALBE, whose conclusions we are about to examine in detail,
considers that the characters of the Neandertal calotte indicate a race so far removed
from all existing varieties of mankind as to be entitled to the rank of a distinct
species, for which he adopts the name of Homo primigenius, Auct. Controversies
as to the validity of species are at present somewhat out of date, so that when
Hcket subdivides the human race into a number of such groups, no one feels
called upon to offer any earnest remonstrance.
