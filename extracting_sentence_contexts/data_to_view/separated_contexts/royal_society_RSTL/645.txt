A conic hyperbola being given; a point may be found, such,
that if from it there be drawn straight lines to all the intersec-
tions of the given curve, with an infinite number of parabolas,
or | hyperbolas, ' of any given" order whatever, lying between
straight lines, of which one /passes through a given point, and
the other may be found, the straight-lines 80 drawn, from the. point found, shall be tangents to the parabolas, or hyperbolas. This is in fact two propositions ; there being a' construction. for the case of parabolas, and another-for that of hyperbolas. PROP. II. PORISM.
