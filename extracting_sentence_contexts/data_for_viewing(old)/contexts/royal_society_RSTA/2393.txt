the albedo of the Earth, which has an average of approximately 0.3, is fundamental for modelling 3 |
Earth’s climate, snow greatly influences the Earth’s albedo with fresh snow having an albedo of

around 0.9. Understanding the relationship between the mechanical properties and the structure
of snow has also been of interest for many years [12-17].

Snowflakes evolve in three ways. First, the dendrite arms on snowflakes are broken off as
the snow blows around or as the snow is compacted due to the weight of snow above it in
a snowpack. Second, the morphology of the snowflakes becomes coarser in order to minimize
their surface area and, hence, surface energy. Third, snow undergoes changes because it usually
resides in a temperature gradient in a snowpack since the sun heats the surface during the
day while during the cold night air cools the surface. In fact, snow often experiences diurnal
alternating temperature gradients. In a temperature gradient, dry snow undergoes much more
rapid microstructural changes than under isothermal conditions [18]. A temperature gradient in
snow produces a water vapour pressure gradient. This produces a flux of water vapour from
the warmer regions to the colder regions. This water vapour flow to colder regions can cause

very large so-called hoar crystals to grow that are only weakly bonded to the surrounding : =
snow crystals. The processes involved in dry snow metamorphism are of great interest for : =
understanding the conditions that lead to avalanches since avalanches can originate in weak :B
layers in the snowpack. Ice lenses, regions of solid ice, within a snowpack, formed on the surface : =
due to either freezing rain or a melt event, are also significant causes of avalanches [19]. 8
Several methods have been used to image snow. No one knows who first photographed 3
snowflakes, but the most famous photographer is Wilson A. Bentley (1865-1931), who was i
