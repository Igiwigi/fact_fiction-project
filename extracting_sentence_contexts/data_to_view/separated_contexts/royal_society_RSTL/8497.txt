every part thereof is at a distance from P exceeding, in fact far exceeding, R; 80 that,
imagining the whole mass ſe dS to be collected at the distance R, the prepotential of
the remaining portion of the surface is less than

viz. we have thus, in the case where the mass ſz as is finite, a superior limit to the
prepotential of the remaining portion of the surface. This will be indefinitely small in
comparison with the prepotential of the disk, provided only #* is indefinitely small

compared with R***, that is # indefinitely small in comparison with R'**s. The proof
assumes that the mass ſg dS is finite; but considering the yery rough manner in which

the limit ſecs was obtained, it can scarcely be doubted that, if not universally, at least

for very general laws of distribution, even when ſe dS is infinite, the same thing is true ;
viz. that by taking e sufficiently small in regard to R, we can make the prepotential of
the remaining portion of the surface vanish in comparison with that of the disk, But
without entering into the question I assume that the prepotential of the remaining
portion does thus vanish ; the prepotential of the whole snrface in regard to the inde-
finitely near point P is thus equal to the prepotential of the disk; viz. its value is
