‘This involved much repetition of observations in order to establish
results, and further complications were introduced, first by Ni 16, which in the early
stages gave one discordant result out of a number of very concordant ones, and later
manifested curious and unexplained changes in length, and secondly by changes in the
basic values accepted for the B.I.P.M. standards. A description of this work, showing how the divergence was eventually reduced to
small but not entirely negligible proportions is given below , the facts being recorded for
convenience in chronological order. Tasie I1.—The Lengths of the Metre Intervals of Ni 184. |
