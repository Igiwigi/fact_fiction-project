same difference of boiling-point, whatever may be the pressure. Let $ and $, be the
boiling-points of two liquids under the ordinary PresSure, and s and s, the boiling-points
under another pressure. Then the assumption of S—S,=s—8, would inyolvye the infer-
ence S—8=S$,—8:; 4. e. that the boiling-points must undergo precisely the same change
for the same change of pressure. But this conclusion, the 80-called law of Darrox, is
by no means correct; and it may be legitimately held that the homologous substances
which under the ordinary pressure do not exhibit the most frequently observed difference
of boiling-point (19®) for the elementary difference C, H,, would certainly show that
difference under a different pressure.

Sufficient data are till wanting for the appreciation of the mode in which differences
in boiling-points are affected by changes of pressure. But the extent of these alterations
may in a measure be inferred from the fact that the difference in boiling-points of
alcohol and ether, which, under the ordinary pressure, amounts to about 44®, from what
is known with respect to the yapour-tension of these two substances at different tempera-
tures, would, under the pressure of half an atmosphere, be above 45, and below 40*
under a pressure of three atmospheres.

From the observations at present at our disposal, it may be affirmed as a general rule,
that in homologous compounds belonging to the same series, the differences in boiling-
points are proportional to the differences of the formule. Exceptions obtain only in
cases in which terms of a particular group are rather difficult to prepare, or when the
substances boil at a very high temperature, at which the observations now at our com-
mand are for the most part uncertain. Again, it may be affirmed that the difference
in boiling-points corresponding to the elementary difference C, Hy, is in a great many
