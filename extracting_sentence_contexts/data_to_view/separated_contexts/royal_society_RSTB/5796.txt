To begin with, the two passages quoted in italics are clearly inconsistent. Secondly, if stimulation of the sciatic nerves or of the central nervous system after
removal of the adrenals causes melanophore contraction, how is one to account for a
negative result on stimulation of spinal nerves? Lastly, if denervated skin still shows
the normal reactions to light and darkness, there appears to be no reason why pieces
of skin in Ringerâ€™s solution should fail to react, nor is it possible to account for the fact
that spinal transection in some cases caused pallor anterior and darkening posterior to
the cut. Tn view of these considerations, one is justified in regarding the evidence of REDFIELD
for the direct reactivity of the melanophores of Phrynosoma to light as inadequate. There remain only the observations of Haptey on Anolis equestris.
