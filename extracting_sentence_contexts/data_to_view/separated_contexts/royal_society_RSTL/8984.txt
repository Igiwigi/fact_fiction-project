When we say that a chemical event is thus constituted of other events into which it
may be resolved, the question arises, what view we take of the nature of such an event
to justify this statement, and of what kind of events it is to be regarded as made up. The reply is given through the peculiar representation of a chemical event, afforded by
the method of this Calculus, by which this fundamental conception is suggested. This
representation is brought under our notice through the development of the method
itself when we express dynamical facts by it, and consider how we are to reason upon
them through its instrumentality. I shall therefore treat the subject in this natural
order, considering first the construction of the © Organon ” or Instrument of reasoning,
then the ideas suggested to us by that Instrument, and to which that Instrument is
applicable. When the nature of a chemical event has been thus defined 80 that we
clearly see what we have to do, the further inquiry lies before us of the theoretical
s0lution of the problem, namely, given a chemical event, how are we to determine the
events of which that event is compounded?
