If the energy required to produce an ion were the same at all pressures, the minimum
sparking potential according to the above theory would be unaltered. This is borne
out by Pwace’s results (Joc. cit., p. 86), where it is shown that the minimum
potential difference for a spark between spherical electrodes 001 centim. apart is
approximately the same for pressures from 300 to 50 millims. of mercury. The
minimum potential rises below 50 millims., indicating that the energy required to
produce an ion may possibly inerease below that pressure.

This theory would suggest that the minimum potential required to produce a spark
conversely might be used as a means of determining the energy to produce an ion.
The phenomenon, however, is more complex than this would indicate. The minimum
sparking potential is to a small extent influenced by the metal used for the electrodes
and also by the gas, and moreover it would leave unexplained the remarkable fact
that when the electrodes are a small distance apart the spark does not follow the
shortest path (/oc. cit.) between them.

- Energy of Radiation of Radio-active Substances.

In a previous paper it has been shown that the ions produced in air by uranium
radiation have the same velocity as the ions produced by Réntgen rays. On the
