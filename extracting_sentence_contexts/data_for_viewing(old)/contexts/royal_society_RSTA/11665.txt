The freezing points from 20°53 to 24°32 inclusive were noted as being so steady as
to resemble eutectic points. This is the region from SnCu, to SnCug.

At 24°32 atoms no precipitate was noticed at the moment of reading the freezing
point, but before the metal had cooled two degrees below the recorded temperature
stirring had become impossible ; in fact, this alloy may be said to solidify at a
constant temperature,

At 25°35 atoms, that is, with more tin than corresponds to SnCu,, we begin
again to notice an abundant precipitate at the moment of reading the freezing point.

After the first reading at 26°96 atoms of tin a portion of the alloy was removed -
from the crucible. This alloy was white, hard, and brittle, with a conchoidal
fracture.

At 30°51 atoms the freezing point was not so well marked as hitherto. ‘There was
much precipitate soon after the reading.
