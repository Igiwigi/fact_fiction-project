The full interpretation of these curves will thus require an accurate knowledge of the
lattice distortion at high temperatures, and it is hoped to be able to present a study of
this later.

The Solid Solubility Curves.

In the preceding sections we have seen how, even for solute elements of favourable
size factor, the simple valency relations for the solidus lines are more sensitive to slight
variations of atomic diameter and lattice distortion than are the relations for the
liquidus curves. For the solid solubility curve where the equilibrium is with a second
solid phase, it is only natural that this effect of size factor and lattice distortion should
be more prominent. A study of the equilibrium diagrams now reveals the fact that
where the alomic size factors are favourable, the maximum «- solid-solubility, to a first
approximation, corresponds to a constant electron concentration. To a higher degree of
accuracy correction factors are required to allow for differences in atomic diameters
and lattice distortions. By the electron concentration is meant the ratio of valency
electrons to atoms, so that for pure copper or silver the value is 1-0, whilst for an alloy
containing x atomic %, of a solute element of valency v, the electron concentration is

1+ ee _ Thus for an alloy containing 20 atomic °% of aluminium, and 80 atomic %

of copper, each 100 atoms of the alloy contain (20 x 3) + (80 x 1) = 140 valency
electrons, and the ratio of valency electrons to atoms is “ =14=1+4 aa) *
In Table XX we give the maximum solid solubility for the alloy systems of favourable
