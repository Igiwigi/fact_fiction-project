We could encounter more conspecifics if these are joining the

non-native species and natives could lead the former to
advantages such as predator avoidance and improved fora-

where these associations might benefit invaders in their

heterospecific groups.

(d) Predator avoidance

Predator avoidance is another key behavioural trait enhan-
cing survival, and grouping is recognized as a mechanism
that contributes to the dilution effect when facing a predator
