should be found in greater abundance on the first discovery of the spring than
after it has been long drawn upon ; and hence, perhaps, the remarkable dis-
crepancy between the results of my examination of the Gloucester and some
other waters, and those given on the authority of former chemists, may be
explained, without impeaching the accuracy of either.

It will be seen by reference to the Table, that I have represented the ingre-
dients of the Leamington waters on the authority of Dr. Taomsox, as stated
by Dr. Loupox in his Practical Dissertation* on these springs ; and those of
Cheltenham, with the exception of one lately discovered at Pittville, on that
of Dr. Scupamors. The springs of Tewkesbury and Gloucester I have myself
examined ; there being of the former no analysis at all, and of the latter only
one by Mr. Accum, which I had reason to believe, what I in fact found, quite
inapplicable to its present composition. The spring which goes by the name of
the Chalybeate Saline is at present destitute of iron, which I am assured it
formerly possessed, whilst the Sulphureous contains no trace of suIphuretted
hydrogen. These two springs, which at present appear almost identical, are
the ones most strongly impregnated with purgative salts, and therefore ap-
proximate more nearly to the character of that analysed by Mr. Accum,
according to his representation, than either of those termed © the pure saline,”
which he professed to have examined. Many of these springs it will be seen
contain traces of bromine and iodine ; but they seem to be less common in the
aperient waters which are occasionally met with in the chalk and tertiary dis-
tricts of this country ; for I haye examined three—those, namely, of Epsom, of
Chad's Well in Gray's-Inn Lane, and of St. Leonard's Hill near Windsor,
