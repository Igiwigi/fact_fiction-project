Among the Apterygota it is unpaired, viz., in Lepisma (Heymons, 1897, a), Tomocerus
(Horrmann, 1911), and others. Its unpaired mode of origin among the Apterygota
and some of the primitive Pterygota would suggest this to be the primary condition. However, the fact that the paired origin of the labrum is more widely distributed
among insects, including the primitive Pterygota, suggests the contrary. On the
whole, this difference in the origin of the labrum cannot be shown to have any
phylogenetic significance. The determination of the morphological significance of the labrum is not easy.
