B.â€”Mechanism of the Reaction between Iodine and Kojie Acid. In considering the mechanism of the reaction between alkaline iodine solution and
kojic acid it is well to bear in mind the fact that alkaline iodine solution can exercise
a double function. On the one hand, it may act as an alkaline hydrolytic agent, and,
on the other, it may act as an oxidising agent. Hence the final products of the reaction
between alkaline iodine and kojic acid, i.e., formic, glycollic, and oxalic acids, may
possibly arise as a result either of hydrolysis, or of oxidation, or of a combination of
the two processes.
