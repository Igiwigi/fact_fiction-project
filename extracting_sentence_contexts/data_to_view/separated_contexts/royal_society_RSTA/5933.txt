Introduction

The kinetic theory proposed by Boltzmann for the
description of rarefied gases has been generalized
to various kinds of interacting systems, providing
reasonable models for the evolution of wealth distribution
[1], for opinion formation [2], for the spread of epidemics
[3] and so on. For the evolution of wealth, the pioneering
models based on binary exchanges, with individuals
saving a fraction of their wealth in each trade, may be
found in [4,5]. A good kinetic model should be able to
reproduce the fact, noted by the Italian economist Pareto
in [6], that for high values of wealth the distribution
function may be approximated by a suitable inverse
power of the wealth itself; this means that a great
part of the total wealth of the considered country is
owned by a small fraction of the population [7,8]. THE ROYAL SO C IETY ©2022 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.
