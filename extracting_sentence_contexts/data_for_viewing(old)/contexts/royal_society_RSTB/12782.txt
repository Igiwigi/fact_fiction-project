where pred is the non-dimensional extension of the predation
region, that can be assimilated to the hunter visual depth, see
also figure 2b.

In other cases (e.g. in other species of animals), the pred-
ator is not confused by the presence of multiple prey, it being
able to target a specific individual within the group and to
change strategy accordingly. For instance, it can chase the
agent which, at a given time, is the closest to its position, i.e.
