Abnormal D triplet Separations.—It has generally been held since RypBeEre’s
discovery of the satellite systems that the triplet separations for the D and § series
are the same. The actual measures did not absolutely prove this, in fact, they
indicated small differences, but the accuracy was not sufficient to establish a real
difference especially as against a natural bias to expect equality. MrGGErs,* however,
has recently placed it beyond doubt that frequently the separations are really
different. In Group L, for instance, the separations as measured from D lines are
less than those determined from § lines. In the rare gases also this difference appears
quite decisively, but here (group 0) the separations as determined from the D lines
are, in general, larger than those from 8. The key to the explanation is found in the
fact that the difference between the two determinations diminishes with increasing
order—in other words, that the sequent in the same set of satellites is not the same,
and that in a large number of cases the value of »,+1, is the same in both S and D
although 1», ». themselves are different. It is found to be completely explained by
the displacement of one or two ouns between the sequents of the first or second
members of a triplet. Sometimes it occurs in the third member. The same explana-
tion accounts for the fact that the F separations are frequently smaller than the
