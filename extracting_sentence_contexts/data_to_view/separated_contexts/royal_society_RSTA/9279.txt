A fluorine atom lies at the
centre of each of the eight cubes into which the large face-centred cube can be
divided. The (100) planes of fluorine now lie half-way between the (100) planes of
calcium, and we explain the disappearance of the first order (100) spectrum by
supposing that they have equal reflecting powers. We assume, in fact, that two
fluorine atoms of weight 38 are equivalent, within errors of experiment to one atom
of calcium of weight 40. This is only one instance out of many; it seems certain
that two planes containing equal weights per unit area are equivalent in reflecting
power, no matter how the weight is made up nor how it is distributed in the plane. As
regards distribution, this is what we should expect: as regards the effect of weight
the result is not so obvious, though it cannot surprise us if we suppose the scattering
to be due to the cumulative effect of the electrons and nuclei of the atoms.
