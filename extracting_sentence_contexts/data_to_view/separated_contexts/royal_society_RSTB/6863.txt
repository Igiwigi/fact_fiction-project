In addition to the forms included below in B. liasica, Haeusler (1890, p. 79, plate 12,
figures 38, 39) recorded B. nitida Brady from the Corallian of Switzerland, and noted a
second form similar to B. punctata dâ€™Orbigny from the same beds. It may be doubted
whether his specific identification would now be acceptable. From the inadequate figures and descriptions given it is often impossible to decide,
without seeing the specimens, whether various forms recorded as Vulvulina or Textularia
should be in fact transferred to Bolivina, e.g. in Schwager (1865) and Zwingli and
Kiibler (1870).
