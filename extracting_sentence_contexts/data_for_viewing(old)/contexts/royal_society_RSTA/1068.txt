ionization. In this way, information about the temporal profile of the ionizing pulse will be
encoded in the momentum distribution of the emitted photoelectrons. More specifically, the
streaked electron momentum distribution contains real-time information on the time-energy
structure of the outgoing electron wavepacket (EWP), including the subsequent processes which
affect this EWP on ultrafast timescales [6].

(i) Linear streaking measurements

Initial experiments performed at FEL facilities employed a linearly polarized streaking laser :=
to produce modulations in the measured photoelectron energy distribution [64-69]. For more :8
information on the development of ultrafast pulse characterization at X-ray FEL facilities, see :
the recent review paper by Helm et al. [70]. Optical streaking experiments were not originally a
developed with XFEL facilities in mind. In fact, many of the techniques now implemented at to
XFELs were pioneered with high harmonic generation-based, table-top attosecond laser sources. (8
The delay-dependent photoelectron spectrum (or spectrogram) of the photoionized electron aw
wavepacket recorded in a two-colour ionization set-up can be used to reconstruct both the :3
streaking laser temporal profile and the average X-ray pulse temporal profile, with a number :8
of different algorithms [71]. However, experiments at XFEL facilities suffer many hardships that .
are not often encountered in table-top attosecond pulse generation. As mentioned earlier, XFEL

pulses typically lack shot-to-shot reproducibility, and the timing synchronization is on the order of

a few hundred femtoseconds. This necessitates a single-shot measurement technique, which can
determine both the X-ray pulse temporal profile and the relative optical/XFEL pulse arrival time.
