of all sink to the lower side of the tube and move for a short distance along it.
Then they begin to rise again here and there, and gradually form the coarse network
which is the forerunner of the regular groups.

An examination with a pocket lens shows that each separate group consists of two
distinct parts, a densely aggregated central region tapering downwards to more or
less of a point, and a lighter, less populated region around it (text-fig. 1, 4-8).
Under a low power of the microscope, it can be seen that this dense central mass
consists of cells apparently falling downwards; the lighter region consists of cells
swimming irregularly upwards (Plate 36, fig. 52).

If kept in the dark, the Euglenz continue to exhibit this phenomenon of
â€œaggregation for several days, until they die, in fact. In one series of experiments
I found that the length of time during which the aggregations persist varied from
four to eight days, but during these periods a large number had become rounded off
and settled to the lower side of the tube, and during the last two days the

ageregations were faint and irregular, A few were usually found motile in the tube
for many days after this, but not sufficient to produce any visible aggregation. The
aggregation is so persistent that the rounded off cells are often found lying on the
