Now, suppose that light of wave-length d im vacuo travels through this composite
medium, whose constants are n/ and x’, The light in vacuo being given by

X = Aexp {2m (t/T — 2/d)},
in this medium it is given by
X = A’ exp {2m (t/T — N’2/d)}
= Ae~ "x exp {2me(t/T — n’z/d)},

so that n’«’ measures the absorption. In fact, the intensity of the light sinks to
