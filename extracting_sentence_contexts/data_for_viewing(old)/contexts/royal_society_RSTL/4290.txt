I have not met with the least indication that the sarcode is contained within any
proper membrane ; and the absence of any such indication, notwithstanding the
various manipulations to which I have snbjected its segments, may be taken, I think,
as strong negative evidence that it has no more existence in this animal, than it has
in the species of Foraminifera which have been s0 well studied by M. Duaarpix and
Professor SCHULTZE. Nor is there the slightest trace of distinct organs, either in the
mass of sarcode which forms the central nucleus, or in that which constitutes each
one of the surrounding segments; and he would, I think, be a mere speculator, who
should maintain the presence of a digestive cavity in any of these parts, or the exist-
ence of an intestinal canal in the peduncular threads which connect them together.
The homogeneity of the component substance of the central nucleus, and of the
entire assemblage of multiple segments, seems, indeed, to be conclusively established
by the following facts :â€”In all the spirit-specimens which I have examined, the cavi-
ties of the outer zones are completely void, whilst those of the nucleus and of the
inner zones are quite filled with their animal contents. This drawing-together of
the soft body towards the centre, is evidenced also in many of the larger specimens
which have been dried when collected in the living state, by the limitation of the red
colour that indicates the presence of the sarcode, to the inner portion of the disk.
In both cases it may be presumed that the animal matter has shrunk together, in the
former through the corrugating action of the spirit, in the latter through desiccation.
Now if the polypidom of a zoophyte be similarly treated, there is no such drawing
together of the entire body, but each cell is found to contain the shrunk contents of
its own polype-segment ; and this difference seems to me to indicate a complete dis-
Similarity in the characters of the two organisms. For it is obvious that the sub-
