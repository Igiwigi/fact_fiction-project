In the main west-north-westerly ghaut south of Gage’s, signs of fumarole activity
extend a little way up the ghaut from Gage’s Lower soufriére (situated in its right
bank) and are to be seen again (e.g. hot springs) for some little way before reaching
Gage’s Upper soufriére (located mainly in the left bank). For some way below these
hot springs the stream has encrusted its bed heavily with iron oxides. The existence of another line of crustal weakness is suggested by the fact that Gage’s
Lower, Spring Ghaut, and Galway’s soufriéres are situated very nearly on a line
trending about E. 30°S. from Garibaldi Hill, through St George’s Hill to the acid
bandaite intrusion of the Roche Bluff centre, south-west of Landing Bay. This direction
is parallel to the general trends of the north-east coasts of South America and Cuba.

all the centres.
