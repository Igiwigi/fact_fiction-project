Indeed, with respect to the parallax of the fixed stars,
several of these objections may be obviated by a proper
Selection of the standard stars. Thus the uncertainties of
refraction may be avoided by using only stars near the zenith.
The objection in the 8th article may be partly obviated by
using the same 5tars for ascertaining the index error at the
two periods of greatest and least parallax, and s0 of other
uncertainties. No error as to parallax arises from neglecting
the unequal motion of the earth in its orbit, as far as regards
the index error computed by the same stars at the two periods.
But this selection of stars will be limiting the use of the. in-
strument, and the advantage of. a mean of a number of ob-
servations lost ; and in fact, with respect to the index errors
used in determining the N. P, D. of » Lyre, « Aquilz, and «
Cygni, as given by Mr. PoxD, Phil. Trans, 1817, no parti-
cular selection of stars, with a view to these points, seems to
have been made.

It may also perhaps be suggested, that the mural circle
may be used without applying index error, as was done with


parallaz of certain fixed stars. 287
