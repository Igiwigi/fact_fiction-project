is It is perhaps hardly necessary to point out that the interpretation given here of the principles under-

in human hair.


STRUCTURE OF HATR, WOOL, AND RELATED FIBRES. 369

Tt may appear somewhat surprising that the g-photograph remains “set” after
exposing the stretched fibre to steam even for a few minutes only, and that subsequently
the «-photograph does not return during the process of either contraction or super-
contraction; but this cannot but be due to the fact that the well-crystallized part of the
fibre substance, the part from which the X-ray “ erystal” photographs arise, con-
stitutes a relatively small fraction of the whole, as is evident from the long X-ray
exposures required. The molecular chains in this well-crystallized part lie parallel
and in the closest possible juxtaposition and are therefore in a condition most favourable
for the formation of new side-linkages ; they will naturally succumb first to the process
of “setting.” The change does not, however, lead immediately to widespread per-
manent set, because the three elastic phases, K,, K, (the most crystalline phase), and
K, (see fig. 8), are both in series and in parallel, so that the super-contraction effect in
the less-crystalline keratin is bound to predominate for a time. (Compare fig. 15,
which shows how the setting of K, lags behind that of K,.) The conflict between the
contraction of the less-crystalline and the setting of the more-crystalline keratin is best
revealed in X-ray photographs of hair stretched and then contracted in steam. Through-
