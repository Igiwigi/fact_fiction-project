has more especially been the case with isobutylaldoxime, even more so than with
cnanthaldoxime.

Still, the depression of irritability in efferent nerve-trunks has never been seen
anything like that observed in the nervous path in muscle-nerve preparations, when
the two structures are together immersed in the same solution,

The poison used in fig. 36 we saw to have been dissolved in equal parts of blood
and normal salt solution, and that, therefore, no contracture was evidenced. The
nerve ceased to convey stimuli in 19 minutes. Now, comparing this result with that
of other experiments in which solutions of isobutylaldoxime of similar strength were

Stused in the absence of blood, the fact is brought out that the loss of irritability in
Sthe nervous path in the one case corresponds in time with the relaxation of contracture
Bnd return of the base-line to the abscissa in the other case. This comparison
Suggests cause and effect. We have seen that the nervous loss of irritability cannot
che due to the action of the drug on the nerve-trunks ; it must, therefore, be referred
Bo the end-plates. It seems then that the failure of conductivity through these
@nd-plates is synchronous with the relaxation of contracture.
a This may perhaps be another argument in support of my contention, that
soontracture, at least in the case of these drugs, is due to their action on the nerve
-Send-plates.
5 Tt will be at once objected that this return fall of the base line does not always
Stake place. I would answer that this is probably due to the tetanic condition of the
gmuscle having been so great or maintained so long, that some actual vigor mortis has
