in [34]. To predict the number of genes that may contain the full
genome sequence of UC1 and UC4, we first performed a
BLASTp v. 2.2.31+ [49] using as a query our predicted proteins
against a database that includes all non-redundant proteins from
UniProt [54] with a cut-off e-value of 1e-04, to identify the potential
contaminant proteins. We removed the proteins that had the first
hit from a bacterial or archaeal origin. However, as there were
many genes without blast match and the annotation process can
overpredict gene content [34], we decided to take into account
only proteins in which, using a Pfam scan, we could find protein
domains. The proteomes of M. brevicollis and S. rosetta contain
approximately 70% of their proteins with a described Pfam protein
domain. Therefore, we considered this fact in our calculations
together with the average between the genomic completeness
obtained by BUSCO and CEGMA (taking into account complete

and fragmented proteins detected), to infer the total number of
proteins that UC1 and UC4 may have in their complete genomes.
