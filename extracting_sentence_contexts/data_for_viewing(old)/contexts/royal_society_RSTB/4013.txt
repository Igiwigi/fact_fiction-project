coming through the male parent (text-figs. 8 and 9).

Finally, in the cross FE. esculentus 2 x E. acutus 2, about 70 per cent. are
straight and the remainder are slightly arched, while in the reciprocal about 65 per,
cent. are straight and the remaining 35 per cent. slightly arched. This is remarkable,
since the one parent has a strongly arched form and the other is slightly arched, but
neither has the straight type which comes out in the hybrids (text-figs. 4 and 5).

It is obvious from what we have already said that the characters of the larval
skeleton in Hchinus are not sufficiently definite to give clear results in hybridization
experiments within this genus. In the end it seems always to remain a matter of
personal opinion which parent the hybrid most resembles in the characters ofâ€™ its
larval skeleton. We have stated the facts above at some considerable length for what
they may be worth, but necessarily there must be a wide difference of opinion as to
their value and significance.

In all the hybrids the development of the larval skeleton is much slower than in
the pure-bred forms, and therefore it shows no variation from the rule drawn
attention to in Section 7. Furthermore, with regard to the larval skeleton,
attention might be drawn to another point of some importance. We have never
been able to distinguish any difference similar to that described by VERNoN (98),
Doncaster (21), and Herpsr (39), in the inheritance of the characters of the
larval skeleton, which these authors attribute to seasonal or temperature conditions.
That is, there is no appreciable difference in the characters of a cross if made at
the beginning or end of the breeding season. VERNON, crossing Strongylocentrotus
