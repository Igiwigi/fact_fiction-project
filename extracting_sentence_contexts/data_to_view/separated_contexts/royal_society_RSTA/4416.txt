The 2005 inventory lakes, and lakes detected by e

radar following that compilation, are mainly located on the ice-sheet plateau (figure 1). These
have never been observed to change significantly, and are thus thought to be stable over long
(multi-decadal to millennial) time periods (e.g. [15]). A second type of lake is detected by virtue of the fact that its volume is changing on sub-
decadal scales. A series of papers in 2005-2007 showed clusters of large (1-10 m) signals of height
change over time on the grounded ice sheet, which were interpreted as the surface expressions
of subglacial water transferring from one area of impoundment to another. When water transfers
occur, the surface of the ice responds: it rises as excess water enters the lake, or falls as it leaves
it.
