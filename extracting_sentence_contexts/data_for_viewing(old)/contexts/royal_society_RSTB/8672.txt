cost financially and to other programmes? The polio pro-
gramme is now in the 25th year of what was intended to be
a 12-year effort.

From experiences to date with eradication programmes, it
seems apparent that at least four factors should be in place
before a launch: a reasonably thorough plan, an established
research programme, success in a significantly large demon-
stration site, and a firm commitment by a majority of

countries with definitive concerns and resources to support
a programme. In light of the fact that there has been only
one success among the seven global eradication programmes
launched to date, the implications of possible failure should
be clearly stated as well.
